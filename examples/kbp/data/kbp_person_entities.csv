After halfof the constituencies were counted, the Muslim Brotherhoodemerged with 13 winners, thus raising their parliamentarypresence to 47 members in the first and second stages of theseelections. As it is known, in the repetitions, 48 of the rulingNational Party and 37 of the Brotherhood candidates are competingagainst each other. Has everyone lost and the Brotherhood won?First of all, how true is this statement? What is it that theruling National Democratic Party lost, if it has really lost? Andhow accurate are the rumors about a new vision within theBrotherhood on dealing politically with these new facts? Why arethe so-called secular opposition parties apparently backslidingbefore the tide of Islamic rhethoric? In Free Hour: Egypt Votes,we will continue with you and those observers and politiciansinvolved to try and learn more about the shape of the comingEgyptian political activity. Firstly, we would like to welcomeour participants today, Mr. Hussein Abdul Raziq, the Secretary-General of the opposition Tagammu Unionist Democratic NationalParty and Dr. Jamal Nassar, director of the Information Office ofthe Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide, who was supposed to joinus but has apologized at the last moment. Hopefully he was notinconvenienced. We also welcome Dr. Hani Raslan, expert at theAl- Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies. Before westart the discussion, I would like us to follow together the mostimportant aspects of the legislative election experience to datein a report presented by our colleague Tariq Shami from Cairo. 2005-11-21 13:03:44

The demands of the coming politicalstage in Egypt in the presence of a fundamental change; theMuslim Brotherhood which had announced itself strongly anddirectly through the results of the Egyptian legislative resultsthat started, I mean, its second round even by officiallypublishing its results. I had paused with Mr. Hussein AbdulRaziq, the Secretary-General of the opposition Tagammu Party, onthe issue of self-criticism by Egyptian political oppositionparties and - generally and the Tagammu Party specifically. Whatin your opinion are the most important points of this criticism,Mr. Hussein? Hessein_Abderrazek Uh, we, uh, all that was mentioned about the external factorsthat led to this poor results for the parties is correct. But theparty is responsible for achieving these  results. Of course wehave not yet started, uh, meetings to evaluate these results, butwe will start when Stage , uh, three is over. And I think thatthe discussion that will take place within the party willconcentrate on ways to overcome the obstacles that are in the wayof the Party's movement and the movement of parties in general,including the election laws. There is a bill for the practice ofpolitical rights that was proposed by Khaled Mohiuddin in 1990and Parliament refused to even discuss it. It never reachedParliament and was kept at the so-called Committee for Proposalsand Complaints. There is a partial agreement among all theparties and a promise from the National Party that the singleseat system will be changed to the proportional, uh, list system.We  must wage a battle to change this demand into a reality basedon the condition that it will not be a return to the conditionalproportional party list which has proven to be in the interest ofa single party, that is the ruling one, and does not achieve thegoal of the system. speaker1 Okay  Mr Hussein,  you are now telling me, I mean, I mean I wouldlike to return, uh, back a few moments in this discussion. Youare telling me about the Party's vision for dealing with othercompetitors and the laws necessary to amend democratic andelection practices in Egypt. But you, I mean, you mentioned thatthere are meetings. You did not mention the most important pointsthat you have against the party's performance, the Tagammu Party,in this stage at least, even if they were your personal opinions,I mean, that you have followed during this long process. Hessein_Abderrazek Yes, the first point is that we delayed too much in breaking theimposed blockade and demonstrating, that is, getting in touchwith the masses. We didn't start doing that until February, uh,2005. speaker1 Yes. Hessein_Abderrazek The party ought not to give in to  the restrictions imposed on itand to begin acting now. Among the things that also need to bereviewed within the Tagammu Party is the financial crisis. Theparty suffers from a financial problem and when it entered theseelections, it had no credit, and was forced to resort tocollecting donations  for the election campaign. From now on, theparty must plan for a five year period. If this committee isfated to last for five years, it must prepare a plan to developits financial resources from  now. speaker1 Yes. Its financial  resources. Hessein_Abderrazek Uh, permanent contact with the masses and providing, uh,financial, uh, resources and, uh, that the party press plays alarger, uh, role in criticizing the status quo and proposing ,uh, solutions, I mean, we did prepare a general election programand printed it in a booklet then, uh, distributed it as asupplement with the Al-Ahali newspaper. speaker1 Yes. Hessein_Abderrazek But I don't think it reached people the way it should have. speaker1 I mean there is the issue of communicating with the masses notjust through demonstrating or, or coming out in public, but alsoby means of, I mean,  direct journalistic and media  activity. Iwill now move to Dr. Hani Raslan Dr. Hani, can we also ask aboutself- criticism, or the most important points that the NationalDemocratic Party, I mean , were missing because there was a greatdeal of failure in its political performance at the last  stage?What in  in your opinions are the most important points? Hani_Raslane Uh, in my view  the confusion that dominated the performance ofthe party at this stage and whose indications  are clearlyobvious, uh, until now. The second issue is the party's inabilityuntil  until this moment to develop a stand on its dissenters.This weakens the organizational, uh, character of the partyitself and adds, or adds to the accusations leveled at it that itis just a shadow, or a parallel entity of the state apparatus,uh, in Egypt. speaker1 Yes. Hani_Raslane Also, uh, there must be more  interaction, availability of dialogand dependence on persuasion and real attractiveness of apolitical program that is really so far, uh, well written speaker1 Last question, aimed at both Dr. Hani and Mr. Hussein. I willstart first with  Dr. Hani, just quickly in the last minutes Isit possible that we will see an alliance between the NationalDemocratic Party and other opposition parties, or any of them toconfront  the huge ascendancy of the Muslim Brotherhood? Hani_Raslane Uh, I don't believe that, because the National Democratic Party,uh, does not need, or it has enough capabilities, potential and,uh, presence in general, uh, not to need to coordinate with theopposition parties, because as the state it is attractive speaker1 Even if that was to limit the Muslim Brotherhood? Hani_Raslane Yes, I don't think so because it is a party that changes lots ofelements and expresses many groups by means of , , ,  inclusionand, uh, the state has a deep-seated presence , I mean, inEgyptian history and therefore it is very attractive. speaker1 Yes.

Bayan_Jabr_Solagh The second. Salem What is going on? Bayan_Jabr_Solagh In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful. Ofcourse, uh, such pre-emptive operations that the Iraqi securityforces carry out, whether the Interior, or Defense, or AlliedForces, all are pre- emptive operations. Uh, we had informationin Diyala that the terrorists, uh, intend to stage more than 35car bombs towards Khanaqeen and Diyala, so we prepared the forceand carried out a qualitative operation to take place for thefirst time in the New Iraq, as more than 2500 soldiers and  350vehicles were mobilized. They moved in three axes and were ableto very easily arrest their targets and, uh, return to theirpositions. Currently we are preparing for a large operation,approximately five times this operation , a force five times thesize will move in a number of axes, uh, it will last three days,uh, either before the elections or after the elections. I don'twant to specify the location or  or the destination, or thedirection, because we have information that terrorists intend tokill innocent people here and there. Salem Yes. Mr. Minister, my question was that in spite of all theseannounced operations there are still many wired cars thatexplode. Where is the glitch? Bayan_Jabr_Solagh ,  what is happening is that  thousands, uh, of militants haveentered Iraq, either Arabs, or from some  Arab or, or non-Arabcountries. And they were able to find themselves an incubator inmany regions of Iraq. As a result, a whole army joined them. Theywere, uh, joined by this army, uh, the Republican Guard,intelligence, security agencies of the former regime. And thisarmy, uh, dissolved and metamorphosed into, uh, a bunch ofterrorists. As a result, this incubator that is in Baghdad, andthat is in the west and east of Iraq, and its north and south,uh, is no doubt difficult for the security forces which werestarted, were started from scratch to eliminate these  terroristsinister forces in days or months. Uh, we need time to  finalizeour security forces and after that we can talk about theeradication of, of these terrorist groups. Salem Mr. Minister, we are talking  talking about two and a half yearssince the former regime ended, maybe a bit longer, but so fartalk is currently about the lack of preparedness or readiness ofthe Iraqi security forces. Is there a defect in the preparationof these forces? Uh, will the preparation of these forcescontinue to be this slow with what the Cairo conference hadproduced in terms of a timetable  for the withdrawal, thewithdrawal of foreign forces in synchronization with thestrengthening of these forces? When will these forces reach therequired standard? Bayan_Jabr_Solagh I can truly say that by the middle of next year, we can say thatthe Iraqi security forces will be able to stand on their feet andwork, uh, alone without the assistance of the allied  forces bythe end of 2006. The forces will be part of the plan that wasdiscussed and very well prepared. By the end of 2006 the, uh,defense forces and the forces of the Interior Ministry will behighly prepared and will be considered one of the best  securityforces in the region. Salem Uh, Mr. Minister, regarding  the operations you spoke of, youmentioned there will also be future operations to combatterrorists. There are complaints from inhabitants of some of theareas where they are present or located, and they say that theoperations do not exempt civilians but are  comprehensive attacksin which many civilians are killed, as has happened in previousoperations. Are there procedures to protect civilians or sparethem the tragedies of these  operations in the future because ofthe presence of these groups in their areas? Bayan_Jabr_Solagh I speak  within the limits of my responsibility. I wasresponsible for the operation in east Iraq, Diyala and Khanaqeen,uh, Balad Drous and the surrounding areas. These ,  operationsstarted and, uh, we pounced on our targets without any, uh,casualties, injured or dead. No one was injured except, uh, oneof our officers, from the Public Order officers. While nocivilians were injured, and the people of Dayila are listening tome now. Also the governor and deputy governor and the wholeprovince council attested that the operation was safe andrespected all human rights and laws, uh, that, uh, we abide by. Salem Uh, Mr. Minister, regarding the former security agencies, whenyou took office you said that the Interior Ministry and itssecurity agencies suffered infiltration, large infiltrationoperations during the past period. There is still talk ofoccurring - happening infiltration of these security agencies inthis ministry, even though it has been months since you took , Imean, is there an obstacle that prevents, uh, dealing with theinfiltrations? Bayan_Jabr_Solagh Uh, of course, no doubt. You are talking about four ministers whowere in charge of the Interior portfolio within two years. We arenot talking about the first six months, but about two years -four ministers succeeding each other in this ministry, and eachminister had his approach and  his policies or his visions. WhenI arrived, I found that, uh, many former intelligence and formersecurity men, and even the takfiris, uh, had infiltrated theInterior Ministry and that is no secret. The National Assemblystarted talking about it. There is a lot of pressure from theSecurity and Defense, uh, Committee in the National Assembly,from all the members of the National Assembly, about thenecessity of cleaning up the Interior Ministry. Uh, we discoveredmany of, of these. They are now in jail, uh, awaiting trials. Uh,some transport terrorists in police cars, some use theiridentities, uh, forge them in certain, uh, centers in theInterior Ministry. We are pursuing them. The issue is, we cameand found this huge amount, uh, of, uh, uh, some people who couldnot be trusted. If it was up to me, if it was left to me, uh, Iwould  bring in all the college, the intermediate schoolgraduates. And we would start with them from, from the beginningto establish the Iraqi force, whether it is  defense or interior,and beef them up, uh, with some  good officers from the securityforces and, or the defense. And after that we create a new force,uh, free from the infiltrations we have suffered and are stillsuffering from. Salem Uh, Mr. Minister Solagh Jabr, please permit me to pause for ashort break after which we will return to complete our dialog.Dear viewers, a break after which we will return. 2005-11-23 13:13:14

You said that in general the Americanswelcome the Cairo conference and the issued statement, but thatthere are American reservations by some to parts of the finalstatement, among them the definition of terrorism. The AmericanEmbassy in Baghdad said that, or a source at the embassy saidthat they perceive as a terrorist anyone who kills a civilian ora soldier, whether American or Iraqi, that that is a terrorist.Are we facing an ideological disagreement over the issue ofterrorism and terrorists, and the definition of the terroristbetween the Iraqi side in its totality and the American side? Steven_Hass  speaker2 Obviously, Americans feel that they are there to try and providestability and create a supervising framework  for the country,and they feel that the Americans who are killed in that fieldhave to be defended and not be attacked in that statement.Instead define the wider issue in terms of defining terrorism.This is a step forward from Washington's point of view. We areseeing what makes us move forward in regard to Iraq, and therewill be, will be six wonderful months soon.  the elections willbe held on December 15th, and we hope things will move  well, andhope that a number of American soldiers will leave after that.After that a parliamentary government will be built. We saw afterJanuary 30th, January, that this is difficult, but these are veryimportant issues. The new Parliament will have to amend theconstitution. This is very difficult and there will be muchdebate. All these issues from the point of view of the UnitedStates are very important, and it seems to us that it is movingforward well despite the  terrorist operations which areoccurring at the same time. As an outsider, I don't want toimpose myself on some of these questions that have been raised bysome of your guests. These are internal questions, but from anoutsider's perception it seems that this program in Iraq is onits way and I see a solution. As an individual I  applaud theIraqi people for that. Salem Uh, Dr. Isam Al-Rawi, we only have two minutes to divide, we willdivide them equally between you and Dr. Hussain Al Shahristani.Do you believe that the continuation of understanding andagreement between the political parties will lead to a reductionin terrorist and armed operations especially if a time scheduleis achieved? Issam_Al_Rawi Of course, provided that a definite schedule with set times isprepared for the withdrawal of the occupation forces and arerecognized as forces of aggression and occupation, not as forcesof liberation, and the legal  resistance is acknowledged anddistinguished from terrorism, and that the resistance is a trueand real part of the Iraqi scene and is carried out by loyalpatriots to liberate their country.

Hussein_Al_Shahristani My brother, Salem Just one minute, so please be quick. Hussein_Al_Shahristani I mean, . Yes. I really am going to confirm what the parties in,in Cairo agreed on. We agreed to define a terrorist as someonewho harms an Iraqi, be it a military person or a civilian. As forothers present in Iraq, there are different opinions, but thisone minute does not permit me to explain the differences inopinion. Anyway, everyone agreed on the necessity of schedulingthe withdrawal of foreign forces from Iraq and building up theIraqi armed forces and eliminating terrorism in preparation forthat withdrawal.

We saw afterJanuary 30th, January, that this is difficult, but these are veryimportant issues. The new Parliament will have to amend theconstitution. This is very difficult and there will be muchdebate. All these issues from the point of view of the UnitedStates are very important, and it seems to us that it is movingforward well despite the  terrorist operations which areoccurring at the same time. As an outsider, I don't want toimpose myself on some of these questions that have been raised bysome of your guests. These are internal questions, but from anoutsider's perception it seems that this program in Iraq is onits way and I see a solution. As an individual I  applaud theIraqi people for that. Salem Uh, Dr. Isam Al-Rawi, we only have two minutes to divide, we willdivide them equally between you and Dr. Hussain Al Shahristani.Do you believe that the continuation of understanding andagreement between the political parties will lead to a reductionin terrorist and armed operations especially if a time scheduleis achieved? Issam_Al_Rawi Of course, provided that a definite schedule with set times isprepared for the withdrawal of the occupation forces and arerecognized as forces of aggression and occupation, not as forcesof liberation, and the legal  resistance is acknowledged anddistinguished from terrorism, and that the resistance is a trueand real part of the Iraqi scene and is carried out by loyalpatriots to liberate their country. Salem Dr. Hussain Al Shahristani what is your comment, especially inlight of what the president , ,  the president of the Iraqirepublic, the president of Iraq, Mr. Jalal Talabani, said? Hesaid that there was no armed resistance in Iraq, only terrorism,That real resistance is peaceful politics. Are we facing thecontinuation of the debate on the issue of resistance and what itmeans? Hussein_Al_Shahristani My brother, Salem Just one minute, so please be quick. Hussein_Al_Shahristani I mean, . Yes. I really am going to confirm what the parties in,in Cairo agreed on. We agreed to define a terrorist as someonewho harms an Iraqi, be it a military person or a civilian. As forothers present in Iraq, there are different opinions, but thisone minute does not permit me to explain the differences inopinion. Anyway, everyone agreed on the necessity of schedulingthe withdrawal of foreign forces from Iraq and building up theIraqi armed forces and eliminating terrorism in preparation forthat withdrawal. So the scheduling of the withdrawal is in factconditional on building Arab, uh, Iraqi forces capable ofprotecting citizens and eliminating terrorists. because no... 2005-11-23 14:53:15

Doctor Hammam, administrative corruption, you are aneconomist, you speak the language of numbers, I meanindependently because sometimes you hear from many politiciansaccused of corruption, uh, he tells you may be the Head of theCommission Integrity or someone else, Radi Al Radi, so-and-so isa politician who gets into issues]that have no relevance. Thereis corruption, there are numbers indicating that there iscorruption, even if the issue is only about diction and speeches. *Hammam_Chammaa Certainly, the figures concerning administrative corruption areastounding. At least I start with figures of, uh, the rationcard, which uh, feeds the Iraqi people. According to the lastreports issued by the Ministry of Finance, which I especiallyobtained, and are not published through the internet, the costsof the ration card amount to six, six thousand billions, I meansix million, uh, a thousand Iraqi dinars, which is equivalent tofour billion, uh, dollars. If we divide this amount, six dinars,by the size of Iraq's population, which according to the lastsurvey issued by the Central Office of Statistics, which amountsto 27,962,000, the yearly quota would be 214,000 dinars. Which isa monthly equivalent of  17,800 dinars, including infants to theelderly, and even the deceased whose family hasn't yet, or hisfamily hasn't reported his death, yet. 17,800 dinars; the Iraqicitizen has not received, during the   old months, other thanless than a third of that, at market prices, rather than importprices, at market prices; he did not receive goods equivalent toa third of it. The question here is where have those funds gone?What is the High Commission for Integrity doing to monitor theMinistry of Trade's allocations for ration cards, and how itspent those funds and where they've gone, if there is anyremainder of those funds? The Iraqi citizen is currentlycomplaining that he hasn't received sugar for years. Currently,there is, uh, a decision I think that was made, I read it in, innewspapers, in the media, that, or in a statement oby theMinister of Oil, that the government has decided to allocate 500billion dinars from oil revenue, to spend on more than twomillion poor families,referring to the the fact that this is thefirst time these families are benefiting from oil revenues. Ofcourse, this is part, uh, of the election campaign, rather than,uh. What was the government's stance towards, towards, towardsnegligence in distributing the ration card allocations, giventhat funds were allocated for it according to the Ministry ofFinance's figures? That means, the funds were allocated, , andare not, uh, unallocated funds. I am talking about figures in thesame  table, saying that there is 300 billion dinars as expensesto support farmers. It's known that, all, all support, , , forpoultry farms has been stopped. So, what is meant by spending tosupport farmers?

I move to Doctor HammamShammaa. Doctor Hammam, administrative corruption, you are aneconomist, you speak the language of numbers, I meanindependently because sometimes you hear from many politiciansaccused of corruption, uh, he tells you may be the Head of theCommission Integrity or someone else, Radi Al Radi, so-and-so isa politician who gets into issues]that have no relevance. Thereis corruption, there are numbers indicating that there iscorruption, even if the issue is only about diction and speeches. *Hammam_Chammaa Certainly, the figures concerning administrative corruption areastounding. At least I start with figures of, uh, the rationcard, which uh, feeds the Iraqi people. According to the lastreports issued by the Ministry of Finance, which I especiallyobtained, and are not published through the internet, the costsof the ration card amount to six, six thousand billions, I meansix million, uh, a thousand Iraqi dinars, which is equivalent tofour billion, uh, dollars. If we divide this amount, six dinars,by the size of Iraq's population, which according to the lastsurvey issued by the Central Office of Statistics, which amountsto 27,962,000, the yearly quota would be 214,000 dinars. Which isa monthly equivalent of  17,800 dinars, including infants to theelderly, and even the deceased whose family hasn't yet, or hisfamily hasn't reported his death, yet. 17,800 dinars; the Iraqicitizen has not received, during the   old months, other thanless than a third of that, at market prices, rather than importprices, at market prices; he did not receive goods equivalent toa third of it. The question here is where have those funds gone?What is the High Commission for Integrity doing to monitor theMinistry of Trade's allocations for ration cards, and how itspent those funds and where they've gone, if there is anyremainder of those funds? The Iraqi citizen is currentlycomplaining that he hasn't received sugar for years. Currently,there is, uh, a decision I think that was made, I read it in, innewspapers, in the media, that, or in a statement oby theMinister of Oil, that the government has decided to allocate 500billion dinars from oil revenue, to spend on more than twomillion poor families,referring to the the fact that this is thefirst time these families are benefiting from oil revenues. Ofcourse, this is part, uh, of the election campaign, rather than,uh. What was the government's stance towards, towards, towardsnegligence in distributing the ration card allocations, giventhat funds were allocated for it according to the Ministry ofFinance's figures? That means, the funds were allocated, , andare not, uh, unallocated funds. I am talking about figures in thesame  table, saying that there is 300 billion dinars as expensesto support farmers. It's known that, all, all support, , , forpoultry farms has been stopped. So, what is meant by spending tosupport farmers? Wasn't the Integrity Commission at the NationalAssembly supposed to question the Minister of Agriculture aboutthese sums? Wasn't , , part of the High Commission's duty tofollow up and audit spending methods? We have reached the end ofthe financial year, we are in the penultimate, , month of thefinancial year. How were 300 billion Iraqi dinars spent? Thereare grants to unions, syndicates and associations, at an amountof 25 billion Iraqi dinars.

With the Tower of Babel, I come back to my guestsand hear from you, hear from whom I did not hear about the issuesand problems. Who would like to talk briefly? *Haytam_Hussein Uh, my question is about the directives issued by the Ministry ofFinance. Are they applied differently in each ministry? I mean,making, making such-and-such a ministry, and they tell you, oh!There are directives from the Ministry of Faineance that havebeen issued? The ministry has applied? Then he tells you thatthey are irrelevant; I did not receive a letter mentioning that;I did not understand. Uh, we have many employees who completedtheir university studies, have a diploma or a secondary schoolcertificate; finished his study with a higher qualification. Allthe ministries, or most ministries consider the years of serviceand the obtained qualification; his salary is adjusted, but thejob title, he wants to show the qualification which which [helpedhim] obtain a new promotion. Some ministries tell you, no, I'llgive you  a new job title, but you have to put all yourexperience behind you, and start from the beginning; that meanswe count 20 years of service. Impossible, I mean, if hesacrifices years of service, the employee. Imad_Al_Khafaji I am still, I am still focusing on the program's topic. There isa difference between the terms administrative corruption,administrative laxness and administrative disorder. It's alright,listen to this example, I mean, the public facing you now, when Igo outside and I see a school, they say it was completed by therebuilding campaign, and I find its paint peeling off, this is aproblem that I can identify.  I ask, I mean, I ask aboutappointing an employee through bribery, and they tell youappointments are not available to others. That is, I can say itis administrative corruption; it's alright to focus on thisissue. I mean, I wish to hear examples. That's why you are here.We do not want to talk, and I do not want to go to the street andbring examples, or sit and talk about them. We want to hear fromyou about a case of administrative corruption, something youconsider administrative corruption. *Haytam_Hussein And, uh, sorry Mr. Imad, anything which is lingering in theministry's business is corruption, like when directives arriveand they are not applied properly, this would be corruption. Imad_Al_Khafaji What is the issue? *Haytam_Hussein The issue, I don't know. I [want] to ask, why? Imad_Al_Khafaji I hear from others,  from, from people I haven't heard from. speaker2 Sir, some phenomena, the executive directors appoint theirpermanent staff, staff, uh, the phenomenon, uh, the poor personis appointed, he is invited by phone, or one of his friends, orhis relative, he appoint them as permanent staff, he has contractwith them. Imad_Al_Khafaji You can complain at the same institution, this, which, which,does not, does not give you your right, and give the right toothers. speaker2 When you want to complain, you cannot see the minister, you donot reach him, you cannot reach him, there is one inspector-general, and. Imad_Al_Khafaji I hear from others as well, briefly, so we answer thesequestions, or we try to get answers. *Ammar_Yahya Certainly, Ammar Yahya, an employee at the Ministry of Transport.Demonstration, of course, uh, during, uh, an act ofadministrative corruption at the Ministry of Transport, at theGeneral Company of Passenger Transport, a big number of peoplehad demonstrated peacefully, well, those who had not receivedtheir , salaries for 5 months, from the date of June 5th untiltoday, their salaries have not been paid. It resulted in, afterthe demonstration, a member of the union's committee beingarrested for his verbal support of the demonstration. He wasarrested, and one of the demonstrators was also arrested. Well,they are still detained. I attended , the program, and they arecurrently detained in a new detention center called the DetentionCentre of the General Company of Passenger Transport. Imad_Al_Khafaji I come back to Doctor Hammam Shammaa. The questions might relateto Mr. Kamal, uh, Al Saidi, Justice Radi Al Radi. We ask aboutthe economy; as an economist, the word corruption is related tothe country's economy, it destroyed the country's economy. Theseexamples, might seem to be from every-day life. Is corruptiononly at the level, the level of appointments, or is the issue ancase of billions, not a case of first-level or second-levelemployees, or  highly-ranked officials? *Hammam_Chammaa No, indeed, Mr. Imad, I believe that what the citizen is talkingabout and the suffering is a form of partial corruption, I mean,at the bribery level, at the level of what is, uh, inherited fromthe past. And I quote the maxim, If the paterfamilias is atambourine player, what would be the household's ritual?. So,that means, if ,  a low- ranking employee knows that a seniorofficial is appropriating billions, so he, uh, finds, from, from,from, from the project, to, to take as much as he can in smallamounts. I'm talking about, about, uh, enormous fortunes, uh,about sums, about spending big amounts, , amount to , uh, 255,000barrels a day, smuggled and , uh, credited into accounts inAmman, in Jordan, under names of Iraqi officials. Imad_Al_Khafaji In the Iraqi economy, according to economic theory, this countryis ruined, this is a pile. You want to create a country with aneconomy. He says, uh, it's said that corruption rots the body ofthis country, it stops its rising. The economy, what are thesolutions to this problem, other than  legal measures? Ar theresolutions, even associated to the legal measures? *Hammam_Chammaa Yes, no. Uh, there are two sides, the technical economic side andthe political side. Uh, the technical economic side istransparency, no alternative to transparency in fightingcorruption. Imad_Al_Khafaji Tell me, shush, you might have taken, shush, might. *Hammam_Chammaa It must, there must be a law out there. The constitution hasomitted, or the draft of the constitution, and although I warnedabout that, in many articles and at many meetings, that aprovision in the constitution must be included, , , providing forthe necessity to legislate a law that regulates transparency anddata exchange except those related to pure military strategicissues and security. All data must be made available to themedia, to specialist researchers. Imad_Al_Khafaji Just as oil belongs to the people, the data belongs to thepeople. *Hammam_Chammaa The data must be owned by all. The slogan, no to corruption, mustbe raised through transparency. And transparency is the onepossible solution, which has been missing in Iraq, and asituation that has been built up over a long time. Uh, now you goto government institutions and ask for information and data, theytell you that they do not provide you with this informationbecause it is confidential. And sometimes they say that theadministrative system is still, uh in confusion and disarray, andwe cannot , ,  complete this information and these data. But infact, it's also part of administrative corruption that, no, manyministries want don't want issue the data, don't want to issuethe information. Why does the Ministry of Trade have a website,and no? On this internet website, you find on it, uh, uh,ridiculous things irrelevant to tenders, to ,  to bids, toreferrals, to import figures, to the balance of trade. So, whatthe Ministry of Trade is doing? Imad_Al_Khafaji Yes. *Hammam_Chammaa Refer to the website, it has no website on the internet at all.How much oil does Iraq export? How much? Imad_Al_Khafaji It's, it's, it's in all ministries, in most institutions. *Hammam_Chammaa In all ministries of economy, I'm at least still looking for, asan economic researcher, for, for websites of them, I could findabsolutely nothing, except the Central Bank of Iraq that has awebsite with simple information, which they are trying to update.But the other ministries have no websites and have no accuratedata. Uh, at the time the United States of America releases dataon Iraqi oil exports. And the KGB Company, uh, issues reportsshowing Iraqi exports within months and within days, while theMinistry of Oil does not issue such data. Imad_Al_Khafaji Thank you Mr. or Doctor Hammam Shammaa.

We ask aboutthe economy; as an economist, the word corruption is related tothe country's economy, it destroyed the country's economy. Theseexamples, might seem to be from every-day life. Is corruptiononly at the level, the level of appointments, or is the issue ancase of billions, not a case of first-level or second-levelemployees, or  highly-ranked officials? *Hammam_Chammaa No, indeed, Mr. Imad, I believe that what the citizen is talkingabout and the suffering is a form of partial corruption, I mean,at the bribery level, at the level of what is, uh, inherited fromthe past. And I quote the maxim, If the paterfamilias is atambourine player, what would be the household's ritual?. So,that means, if ,  a low- ranking employee knows that a seniorofficial is appropriating billions, so he, uh, finds, from, from,from, from the project, to, to take as much as he can in smallamounts.

Ar theresolutions, even associated to the legal measures? *Hammam_Chammaa Yes, no. Uh, there are two sides, the technical economic side andthe political side. Uh, the technical economic side istransparency, no alternative to transparency in fightingcorruption. Imad_Al_Khafaji Tell me, shush, you might have taken, shush, might. *Hammam_Chammaa It must, there must be a law out there.

Imad_Al_Khafaji Just as oil belongs to the people, the data belongs to thepeople. *Hammam_Chammaa The data must be owned by all. The slogan, no to corruption, mustbe raised through transparency. And transparency is the onepossible solution, which has been missing in Iraq, and asituation that has been built up over a long time. Uh, now you goto government institutions and ask for information and data, theytell you that they do not provide you with this informationbecause it is confidential. And sometimes they say that theadministrative system is still, uh in confusion and disarray, andwe cannot , ,  complete this information and these data. But infact, it's also part of administrative corruption that, no, manyministries want don't want issue the data, don't want to issuethe information. Why does the Ministry of Trade have a website,and no? On this internet website, you find on it, uh, uh,ridiculous things irrelevant to tenders, to ,  to bids, toreferrals, to import figures, to the balance of trade. So, whatthe Ministry of Trade is doing? Imad_Al_Khafaji Yes. *Hammam_Chammaa Refer to the website, it has no website on the internet at all.How much oil does Iraq export? How much?

Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou I am still in the southern suburbs and the cluster bombs are notnew, they were around in 1982, but after that they have not beenused, at least, not in this density. Erm this morning we were allstill saying that Hezbollah is saying that they are clusterbombsbut now after these pictures which our colleague Bushraobtained, we are certain that there are cluster bombs and thatIsrael has actually used them. Regardless of the - the militaryissues and military considerations for the use of cluster bombsbut this use, it is knownthat cluster bombs are bombs that arebanned internationally and this message from Israel regardless,as you said, of considerations on the ground is that it is alsoready to go a step uh in her confrontation with Hezbollah to goto the extreme limit in using all types of weapons. But as longas I am in the southern suburb, I am reporting that, am referringto a main point as was mentioned by the Secretary General ofHezbollah, Mr Nasrallah, and in my personal opinion, the mostimportant thing Nasrallah said and I characterize this speech asbeing a biased speech in every sense of the word since theassassination of the  - the late Rafik Hariri and the withdrawalof the Syrian forces. What Mr Hasan Nasrallah said today isconsidered a detailed speech and it is biased in every sense ofthe word as he clearly stated that the resistance option willcontinue and it did not change either before the withdrawalofSyrian forces and or after them, not because of internationalpressure and not after it. Consequently, I believe that Nasrallahhas decided on the quarrel which is going on now. Can Hezbollahrelinquish its weapons? Will it be possible to step down from thequestion of resistance? Deciding it finally and in detail nowcannot be stepped back from and this is the mostimportant messagesent today to erm Mr Hasan Nasrallah. With us is retiredBrigadier Walid Sakriya for us to discuss with him these twofacts. Let us start if you would allow it, Brigadier, with theuse of the weapons, the use of uhthe - the cluster bombs. As amilitary man, in your opinion why has Israel used them? *Walid_Sukkaria The - the cluster bombs are basically uh, they have been preparedfor use against civilian targets against civilians, againstliving people, against living human beings and not vehicles.America started to use them in the Vietnam War to hunt downelements who were in the jungle, in the woods andfoxholes. Theyare normally used when the enemy's personnel are protected by ahole or trench or by - behind targets or somethingsimilar to thatand you cannot uh hunt them down or hit them with a direct hitwith machine guns or with the - gun of a tank or even withtraditional tank shells, so you resort to using cluster bombs sothat there is a greater likelihood of causing human losses. Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou But, why has Israel used them? *Walid_Sukkaria It has used them as a result of Israel uh perhaps in clashes itfound itself unable to catch these elements uh from theresistance firing at its positions and to cause them casualtiesand losses by a direct hit from machine guns or tanks. Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou Yes *Walid_Sukkaria It resorted to this type of weapon in an attempt to bring themdown and destroy them or to hitthem so that they would stop uhoperations. Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou Now do you see it necessary that Lebanon puts forward a complaintto the United Nations Security Councilor pursues this questionthe more so as weapons that are banned internationally have beenused? *Walid_Sukkaria Of course, it could submit a complaint to be added to the rest ofthe complaintssubmitted by Lebanon and all the Arab statesagainst Israel about its violation of international law and ofall bans. Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou Yes. *Walid_Sukkaria But at the United Nations we are very much aware that Israel hascomplete protectionfrom the United States due to the lack ofdiscussion of any uh issue  condemning Israel or decrying it. Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou - Please, Brigadier, sir, due to lack of time, you have listenedto the words of Mr Nasrallah,what is your reading of what hashappened concerning, What is the basic message which he wants tosend abroad and the message which he wants tosend to some of theparties at home? *Walid_Sukkaria The - of course, the speech of Mr Hasan Nasrallah has uh a highovertone ofescalation and a message directed to the outside worldand home. Israel in the recent period has fluctuated in itsviolations of the  sovereigntyof Lebanon. Violations in the sea,daily violations in the air, going as far as the bordersof thecapital and further North uh the fishermen's line in the sea offthe Lebanese coast. And finally the violation uh the entry ofvehicles crossing the blue line and they enteredthe territoriesand the clash occurred. Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou Ye, what is the message to the outside world? *Walid_Sukkaria This clash took place and these losses were announced on bothsides, on the Hezbollah side, the resistanceand on the Israeliside. The message to Israel is that we will not keep quiet aboutany infringements and will not be and are not weak and thetransformation whichyou believe has happened in Lebanon, has nothad an effect on us and won't influence us but we are continuingin our work to liberate what remains of Lebanon's territory andour prisoners and uh in the battle and -  the states of the worldwhich remain silent about Israeli infringements you, if you wantpeace on Lebanese soil, then you must push Israel to withdraw,release the prisoners and stop the Israeli attacks andviolations. Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou What is the message to those at home? *Walid_Sukkaria Of course, internally, America has tried or thought that it afterthe - uh withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon that thevehicle of the - stripping the Weapon of the Resistance is beingdone by means of uh Lebanese society, the Lebanese state and theLebanese national institutions. Of course, there is uh it was notable to do that and it found that the biggest section ofLebanesesociety is still in - solidarity with the resistance andis standing by its side until liberation is complete. So the -after the operation that happened in the south two days ago uhsome of the voicesinside Lebanon rose questioning who was thedecision-maker for war and peace: is it the Lebanese state orHezbollah? Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou Yes *Walid_Sukkaria Does Hezbollah have the right to work uh the - in completefreedom or do its actions need controllingand even some of thevoices have directed, Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou Yes OK, who is the defender? *Walid_Sukkaria This is a reply at hand that this subject Ghassan_Ben_Jeddou Brigadier, sir, Nasrallah is also the Secretary General ofHezbollah and has referredpositively to the position of thegovernment. To you the line in Doha. speaker1 Thank you Ghassan Ben Jeddo in the southern suburb of Beirut. 2005-11-25 09:25:10

Um, but really, wa- whathappened was that it went through a legal process.  It wentthrough certain laws that um maybe it's time to revise certainlaws within the Kurdistan region. Wolf_Blitzer Because to to Western audiences,  This sounds outrageous that, inin an emerging democracy.  Someone goes to jail for criticizing apolitician. Qubad_Talabany Well we are, we are an emerging democracy.  And that we stillneed to revise some of our laws.  We need to improve on ourinstitutions.  Ah, and this is an area that I think we willcertainly need to focus more on,  The issues of civil liberties,and freedom of speech. Um, but the whole process has been, um alegal process.  It's been a judicial process.  And um, thePresident of the Kurdistan region will likely issue a pardon. Wolf_Blitzer So you're you're free to announce that now that he's going to bereleased from jail?  All right, let's move on and talk about thegovernment in Iraq.  Your father's the President of Iraq,  Ah,Jalal Talabani.  Alright, Ibrahim al-Jaafar,  Is he someone thatshould be the next prime minister?  He's the acting primeminister right now. Da- do the Kurdish factions in the parliamentsupport Ibrahim Al- Jaafari? Qubad_Talabany The Kurdistan um regional national assembly does not support umMr. Jaafari's nomination.  Um, and we don't want to personalizethe issue. Dr. Jaafari is is a smart man.  He's he's a braveIraqi patriot who's been in the opposition for many, many years.Um, but we're feeling that, given the state that the country isin right now.  Given the polarization of Iraqi society.  Thecountry requires a leader that can bring about um national unity,and can truly lead a national unity government. Wolf_Blitzer Who's that? Qubad_Talabany We're not quite sure yet, but this is the discussions that areongoing. Wolf_Blitzer Who's someone that would be acceptable to the Kurdish faction? Qubad_Talabany Um, it's it's you know, it's not about personalities here.  Weneed to sit down, look at the various lists of candidates.  We weneed to find out what their policies are. We need to find outtheir track history and their records.  And and this is somethingthat is required.  Um a consultative process with all of thedifferent communities.  Um because, ultimately, we need to find acandidate that that has consensus among the differentcommunities.  It's not just what we say. Wolf_Blitzer Do you *wanna give us some names? Qubad_Talabany Um, I'd rather not give names.  I think this is a process that'sgoing on behind closed doors.  And putting people's names out inthe forefront could jeopardize their chances. Wolf_Blitzer Ah, listen to what ah the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, ZalmayKhalilzad, Said on March seventeenth.  Listen to this. Zalmay_Khalilzad Important ah point from our point of view ah is that the primeminister should be someone who can unify Iraq,  The variousethnic, and sectarian groups.

Wolf_Blitzer Let me read to you from a New York Times piece on Thursday.Kurdistan may be part of Iraq in the legal sense.  But most Kurdsview the Arabs, whether Sunni or Shiite, as foreign oppressors.The fact that the Arabs are now fighting among themselves evokeslittle sympathy.

Qubad_Talabany It's it's no surprise that the people of Kurdistan yearn forindependence.  Um, and it's no surprise, given the history of theKurds of Iraq,  Um, that they feel somewhat suspicious, andscared about the developments that are going on in Iraq.

PERSON~Carol_Lynn~CNN_LIVEFROM_ENG_20060602_125801.LDC2006E91~CNN_LIVEFROM_ENG_20060602_125801.LDC2006E91  STORY  2006-06-02 13:01:37  Kathleen_Coke Well, Carol let's start first of all with the March incident inAshaki. That happened in when uh a US lead raid w- took on uhbasically they were looking for a terrorist took on what theysuspected was a terrorist safe house. And and the US militarysays at that point four people were killed one of them aninsurgent. But the military launched an investigation afterlocals claimed no it was eleven civilians who were killed and theBBC began airing aftermath video of the incident yesterday thatwas provided by a Sunni political group. That the networks uhshows dead bodies with gun shot wounds. On of the top commandinggenerals in Iraq earlier today discussed why he thinks theseincidents are happening. speaker1 It's difficult to pin down specifically what obviously whenyou're in the combat theater dealing with enemy combatants whodon't abide by the law of war. Who do acts of indecency. Umsolders become stressed. They become fearful. It's very difficultto determine in some cases on this battle field who is acombatant and who is a civilian. uh It doesn't excuse uh the actsthat have occurred. And we're going to look into them what Iwould say stress, fear, isolation, and in some cases um they'rethey're just upset. They see their buddies getting blown up onoccasion. uh They they uh they could snap. Kathleen_Coke Defense secretary Donald Rumpsfeld who is in Singapore for adefense leaders conference was asked about the investigations andhe said that quote, in conflicts things that shouldn't happen dohappen. And he insisted that ninety-nine point nine percent offorces in Iraq are doing the right thing. Carol. Carol_Lynn So, Kathleen where does the investigation go from here. Well,lets talk about the other two investigations of first of allHumadea there are seven US marines right now who are in the brigright in camp Pendleton in California.  Because of the shootingof an Iraqi man uh who reports say was dragged from his home wasshot and killed and then had both  a weapon and shovel planted onhim to make it appear though he was trying to uh set a road sidebomb. Now sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN  thatmilitary prosecutors will very soon file charges against theseven marines of murder uh the defense attorney for one of themen  they will also face charges of conspiracy and kidnapping. Kathleen_Coke Now this unrelated to the on going investigation into the deathsof the twenty-four Iraqi civilians, in the town of Hadisa nowthat incident took place in November. Washington Post isreporting today that investigators in that case are now hopingthat they will be able to exhume some of the bodies of the uhtwenty-four victims,  that in an effort to gain some forensicevidence. uh That could be very very helpful in theinvestigation in finding out exactly what happened they want tolook at things like the distance from which the shots were fired,the angle of the gun, and uh also the caliber- caliber of the uhbullets used and to try to figure out uh who did this and andjust how it occurred Carol. Carol_Lynn Kathleen thank you very much. Well, as Kathleen, hashaki  thatincident occurred back in March and details are only now justemerging. US forces say they were tracking an al Quaeda suspectand they came under fire and that four people were killedincluding two women and a child. Well, and Iraqi police reportestimates triple that number of people died,  And under differentcircumstances. CNN's John Voz is in Baghdad with more. John, inlight of Hudisa these two other incidents do they take on newmeaning now? John Well, very much so Carol it seems that in the light of Hudisaincident some old accusations are now taking on new meaning. Theincident in Ezaki was reported back on March fifteenth,  and thecontradicting accounts were actually made public at the time butnow because of what has happen in Ezaki, it seems all theseaccusations are Being revisited. Let's go over some of thedetails, what we know from Iraqi police From what they've beentold by eye witnesses on the scene. They accused US forces ofrounding up eleven members of the one family, taking them insidethe home holding them there for about an hour, and then shootingthem all dead five children  four women and two men. Iraqi policealso claim that inside that house they found bullet casings thattype which are only used by the US military. You did mention thediscrepancy with the  US account here. The US says there couldhave been an al Qaeda operative or uh some kind of a fir- uh uhsupportive operative for al Qaeda in the home. They launched anoperation as US forces moved in there was a fire fight. Theycalled in air support the house was hit by an air strike. It wasdestroyed. At sometime it was never made clear by the US report,but in some case -- at sometime  during the process of thisoperation they say those four people were killed three of theydid admit at the time were civilians. Today, the only thing theUS military would confirm is that an investigation is now ongoing but the one important thing the difference here betweenEzaki and Haditha right now  no one is giving out any allegemotive for the Ezaki incident. No one is giving a reason why USforces would have alleged killed these eleven Iraqis. Carol. Carol_Lynn The implication that it would in fact be cold blooded murder ifin fact that story was true. uh now in the in the Hadisa incidentwith the twenty-four civilians killed. The Iraqi prime ministeris now asking for investigative files. I mean how is this goingto be resolved between the military and the prime minister? John Well, this is obviously a an issue now for the I- Iraqi primeminister, he's a new government been in power less than twoweeks. Really has to flex his muscles. Show the Iraqi people thathe is taking charge of the situation. He's also under a lot ofpressure from the Sunni fraction in his national unity governmentall these incidents all three incidents occurred in Sunnidominated towns. So, he's under a lot pressure to prove that he'sgetting things done. He's demanding that file from the USinvestigators. The Iraqi government has also launched their owninvestigation, in a broader sense uh the Iraqi prime ministerMaliqui is now saying that uh the Iraqi civilians uh the victimof violence by US lead forces on a daily bases and he says thatcould play a role in any decision on how long US troops will beasked to stay in this country Carol. Carol_Lynn John,  thank you very much, John Voz live from Baghdad. Now, inone of the incident in Hamedia a hand full marines and navalcormen face possible charges and maybe murder from that incidentback in April. CNN Sumy Dos outside of camp Pendelton California,with more details, Sumy speaker3 Thanks very much Carol, good morning to you. Well, the incidentin Hamedia resulted in the death of one Iraqi civilian that tookplace on April twenty-sixth. The marines who were involved werethe third battalion and the fifth regiment. The who's familiarwith the investigation says that military prosecutors will likelyfile murder charges against the marines who are involved. Now weare also hearing that there will be other charges in addition tothe murder charges conspiracy and kidnapping as Kathleen Cokementioned. um The defense attorney for one of the marinesaccording to the Associated Press those charges may be handed tothe men in seven marine -- um the seven marines and the one navycormen today. However, our sources telling us that it's notunlikely going to happen that soon. Now, there has been someresponse from Camp Pendelton despite the fact that thisinvestigation is not yet complete. The spokesmen for CampPendleton has said the investigation is still on going and nocharges have been preferred. He's also said that several marineshave been placed in pre trial confinement. Several have beenplaced on pre trial based restrictions. Again very important topoint out one Iraqi civil died as a result of this incident inHamedia isn't not to be confused with the incident with Hasia.Carol. Carol_Lynn Sumi what is the mood like there around the base? speaker3 Well, you know you I've um been talking to people here at OceanSide California. That's the town were Camp Pendelton is. And it'sreally mixed and I've talked to marines who are little be angeredthat there there are such negative reports coming out aboutmarines when they are doing a very difficult job over there.There are some people who say you know this just shows what adifficult war this is and and who much the troops are facingchallenges and and and how they in fact feel those troops need tocome home that they are spending too much time on the battlefield there are too many tours of duty that are coming up forthese marines. So there's definitely some mixed reaction here,Carol. Carol_Lynn You bet. It's a military town, Sumi, thank you very much. NowSumi was just mentioning it is too soon to jump to anyconclusions about these attacks.

PERSON~speaker4~CNN_LIVEFROM_ENG_20060602_125801.LDC2006E91~CNN_LIVEFROM_ENG_20060602_125801.LDC2006E91  STORY  2006-06-02 13:01:37  Kathleen_Coke Well, Carol let's start first of all with the March incident inAshaki. That happened in when uh a US lead raid w- took on uhbasically they were looking for a terrorist took on what theysuspected was a terrorist safe house. And and the US militarysays at that point four people were killed one of them aninsurgent. But the military launched an investigation afterlocals claimed no it was eleven civilians who were killed and theBBC began airing aftermath video of the incident yesterday thatwas provided by a Sunni political group. That the networks uhshows dead bodies with gun shot wounds. On of the top commandinggenerals in Iraq earlier today discussed why he thinks theseincidents are happening. speaker1 It's difficult to pin down specifically what obviously whenyou're in the combat theater dealing with enemy combatants whodon't abide by the law of war. Who do acts of indecency. Umsolders become stressed. They become fearful. It's very difficultto determine in some cases on this battle field who is acombatant and who is a civilian. uh It doesn't excuse uh the actsthat have occurred. And we're going to look into them what Iwould say stress, fear, isolation, and in some cases um they'rethey're just upset. They see their buddies getting blown up onoccasion. uh They they uh they could snap. Kathleen_Coke Defense secretary Donald Rumpsfeld who is in Singapore for adefense leaders conference was asked about the investigations andhe said that quote, in conflicts things that shouldn't happen dohappen. And he insisted that ninety-nine point nine percent offorces in Iraq are doing the right thing. Carol. Carol_Lynn So, Kathleen where does the investigation go from here. Well,lets talk about the other two investigations of first of allHumadea there are seven US marines right now who are in the brigright in camp Pendleton in California.  Because of the shootingof an Iraqi man uh who reports say was dragged from his home wasshot and killed and then had both  a weapon and shovel planted onhim to make it appear though he was trying to uh set a road sidebomb. Now sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN  thatmilitary prosecutors will very soon file charges against theseven marines of murder uh the defense attorney for one of themen  they will also face charges of conspiracy and kidnapping. Kathleen_Coke Now this unrelated to the on going investigation into the deathsof the twenty-four Iraqi civilians, in the town of Hadisa nowthat incident took place in November. Washington Post isreporting today that investigators in that case are now hopingthat they will be able to exhume some of the bodies of the uhtwenty-four victims,  that in an effort to gain some forensicevidence. uh That could be very very helpful in theinvestigation in finding out exactly what happened they want tolook at things like the distance from which the shots were fired,the angle of the gun, and uh also the caliber- caliber of the uhbullets used and to try to figure out uh who did this and andjust how it occurred Carol. Carol_Lynn Kathleen thank you very much. Well, as Kathleen, hashaki  thatincident occurred back in March and details are only now justemerging. US forces say they were tracking an al Quaeda suspectand they came under fire and that four people were killedincluding two women and a child. Well, and Iraqi police reportestimates triple that number of people died,  And under differentcircumstances. CNN's John Voz is in Baghdad with more. John, inlight of Hudisa these two other incidents do they take on newmeaning now? John Well, very much so Carol it seems that in the light of Hudisaincident some old accusations are now taking on new meaning. Theincident in Ezaki was reported back on March fifteenth,  and thecontradicting accounts were actually made public at the time butnow because of what has happen in Ezaki, it seems all theseaccusations are Being revisited. Let's go over some of thedetails, what we know from Iraqi police From what they've beentold by eye witnesses on the scene. They accused US forces ofrounding up eleven members of the one family, taking them insidethe home holding them there for about an hour, and then shootingthem all dead five children  four women and two men. Iraqi policealso claim that inside that house they found bullet casings thattype which are only used by the US military. You did mention thediscrepancy with the  US account here. The US says there couldhave been an al Qaeda operative or uh some kind of a fir- uh uhsupportive operative for al Qaeda in the home. They launched anoperation as US forces moved in there was a fire fight. Theycalled in air support the house was hit by an air strike. It wasdestroyed. At sometime it was never made clear by the US report,but in some case -- at sometime  during the process of thisoperation they say those four people were killed three of theydid admit at the time were civilians. Today, the only thing theUS military would confirm is that an investigation is now ongoing but the one important thing the difference here betweenEzaki and Haditha right now  no one is giving out any allegemotive for the Ezaki incident. No one is giving a reason why USforces would have alleged killed these eleven Iraqis. Carol. Carol_Lynn The implication that it would in fact be cold blooded murder ifin fact that story was true. uh now in the in the Hadisa incidentwith the twenty-four civilians killed. The Iraqi prime ministeris now asking for investigative files. I mean how is this goingto be resolved between the military and the prime minister? John Well, this is obviously a an issue now for the I- Iraqi primeminister, he's a new government been in power less than twoweeks. Really has to flex his muscles. Show the Iraqi people thathe is taking charge of the situation. He's also under a lot ofpressure from the Sunni fraction in his national unity governmentall these incidents all three incidents occurred in Sunnidominated towns. So, he's under a lot pressure to prove that he'sgetting things done. He's demanding that file from the USinvestigators. The Iraqi government has also launched their owninvestigation, in a broader sense uh the Iraqi prime ministerMaliqui is now saying that uh the Iraqi civilians uh the victimof violence by US lead forces on a daily bases and he says thatcould play a role in any decision on how long US troops will beasked to stay in this country Carol. Carol_Lynn John,  thank you very much, John Voz live from Baghdad. Now, inone of the incident in Hamedia a hand full marines and navalcormen face possible charges and maybe murder from that incidentback in April. CNN Sumy Dos outside of camp Pendelton California,with more details, Sumy speaker3 Thanks very much Carol, good morning to you. Well, the incidentin Hamedia resulted in the death of one Iraqi civilian that tookplace on April twenty-sixth. The marines who were involved werethe third battalion and the fifth regiment. The who's familiarwith the investigation says that military prosecutors will likelyfile murder charges against the marines who are involved. Now weare also hearing that there will be other charges in addition tothe murder charges conspiracy and kidnapping as Kathleen Cokementioned. um The defense attorney for one of the marinesaccording to the Associated Press those charges may be handed tothe men in seven marine -- um the seven marines and the one navycormen today. However, our sources telling us that it's notunlikely going to happen that soon. Now, there has been someresponse from Camp Pendelton despite the fact that thisinvestigation is not yet complete. The spokesmen for CampPendleton has said the investigation is still on going and nocharges have been preferred. He's also said that several marineshave been placed in pre trial confinement. Several have beenplaced on pre trial based restrictions. Again very important topoint out one Iraqi civil died as a result of this incident inHamedia isn't not to be confused with the incident with Hasia.Carol. Carol_Lynn Sumi what is the mood like there around the base? speaker3 Well, you know you I've um been talking to people here at OceanSide California. That's the town were Camp Pendelton is. And it'sreally mixed and I've talked to marines who are little be angeredthat there there are such negative reports coming out aboutmarines when they are doing a very difficult job over there.There are some people who say you know this just shows what adifficult war this is and and who much the troops are facingchallenges and and and how they in fact feel those troops need tocome home that they are spending too much time on the battlefield there are too many tours of duty that are coming up forthese marines. So there's definitely some mixed reaction here,Carol. Carol_Lynn You bet. It's a military town, Sumi, thank you very much. NowSumi was just mentioning it is too soon to jump to anyconclusions about these attacks. CNN military analyst Jane SpiderMarks, points out that the vast majority of troops do conductthemselves properly. And that the military is aggressivelyinvestigating these allegations of misconduct. speaker4 When you hear this your disgusted but you have to realize thatthis is aberrant behavior and the goodness in in and if there'sgoodness in any of this it's that the marine the navy lookingvery very deeply very openly into these charges.

John Well, very much so Carol it seems that in the light of Hudisaincident some old accusations are now taking on new meaning. Theincident in Ezaki was reported back on March fifteenth,  and thecontradicting accounts were actually made public at the time butnow because of what has happen in Ezaki, it seems all theseaccusations are Being revisited. Let's go over some of thedetails, what we know from Iraqi police From what they've beentold by eye witnesses on the scene. They accused US forces ofrounding up eleven members of the one family, taking them insidethe home holding them there for about an hour, and then shootingthem all dead five children  four women and two men. Iraqi policealso claim that inside that house they found bullet casings thattype which are only used by the US military. You did mention thediscrepancy with the  US account here. The US says there couldhave been an al Qaeda operative or uh some kind of a fir- uh uhsupportive operative for al Qaeda in the home. They launched anoperation as US forces moved in there was a fire fight. Theycalled in air support the house was hit by an air strike. It wasdestroyed. At sometime it was never made clear by the US report,but in some case -- at sometime  during the process of thisoperation they say those four people were killed three of theydid admit at the time were civilians. Today, the only thing theUS military would confirm is that an investigation is now ongoing but the one important thing the difference here betweenEzaki and Haditha right now  no one is giving out any allegemotive for the Ezaki incident. No one is giving a reason why USforces would have alleged killed these eleven Iraqis. Carol. Carol_Lynn The implication that it would in fact be cold blooded murder ifin fact that story was true. uh now in the in the Hadisa incidentwith the twenty-four civilians killed. The Iraqi prime ministeris now asking for investigative files. I mean how is this goingto be resolved between the military and the prime minister? John Well, this is obviously a an issue now for the I- Iraqi primeminister, he's a new government been in power less than twoweeks. Really has to flex his muscles. Show the Iraqi people thathe is taking charge of the situation. He's also under a lot ofpressure from the Sunni fraction in his national unity governmentall these incidents all three incidents occurred in Sunnidominated towns. So, he's under a lot pressure to prove that he'sgetting things done. He's demanding that file from the USinvestigators. The Iraqi government has also launched their owninvestigation, in a broader sense uh the Iraqi prime ministerMaliqui is now saying that uh the Iraqi civilians uh the victimof violence by US lead forces on a daily bases and he says thatcould play a role in any decision on how long US troops will beasked to stay in this country Carol. Carol_Lynn John,  thank you very much, John Voz live from Baghdad. Now, inone of the incident in Hamedia a hand full marines and navalcormen face possible charges and maybe murder from that incidentback in April. CNN Sumy Dos outside of camp Pendelton California,with more details, Sumy speaker3 Thanks very much Carol, good morning to you. Well, the incidentin Hamedia resulted in the death of one Iraqi civilian that tookplace on April twenty-sixth. The marines who were involved werethe third battalion and the fifth regiment. The who's familiarwith the investigation says that military prosecutors will likelyfile murder charges against the marines who are involved. Now weare also hearing that there will be other charges in addition tothe murder charges conspiracy and kidnapping as Kathleen Cokementioned. um The defense attorney for one of the marinesaccording to the Associated Press those charges may be handed tothe men in seven marine -- um the seven marines and the one navycormen today. However, our sources telling us that it's notunlikely going to happen that soon. Now, there has been someresponse from Camp Pendelton despite the fact that thisinvestigation is not yet complete. The spokesmen for CampPendleton has said the investigation is still on going and nocharges have been preferred. He's also said that several marineshave been placed in pre trial confinement. Several have beenplaced on pre trial based restrictions. Again very important topoint out one Iraqi civil died as a result of this incident inHamedia isn't not to be confused with the incident with Hasia.Carol. Carol_Lynn Sumi what is the mood like there around the base? speaker3 Well, you know you I've um been talking to people here at OceanSide California. That's the town were Camp Pendelton is. And it'sreally mixed and I've talked to marines who are little be angeredthat there there are such negative reports coming out aboutmarines when they are doing a very difficult job over there.There are some people who say you know this just shows what adifficult war this is and and who much the troops are facingchallenges and and and how they in fact feel those troops need tocome home that they are spending too much time on the battlefield there are too many tours of duty that are coming up forthese marines. So there's definitely some mixed reaction here,Carol. Carol_Lynn You bet. It's a military town, Sumi, thank you very much. NowSumi was just mentioning it is too soon to jump to anyconclusions about these attacks. CNN military analyst Jane SpiderMarks, points out that the vast majority of troops do conductthemselves properly. And that the military is aggressivelyinvestigating these allegations of misconduct. speaker4 When you hear this your disgusted but you have to realize thatthis is aberrant behavior and the goodness in in and if there'sgoodness in any of this it's that the marine the navy lookingvery very deeply very openly into these charges. This is a wideopen aperture and they're shedding a lot of light on it as theyshould. Carol_Lynn Now the defense secretary Donald Rumpsfeld spoke out today. He isdefending the training and conduct of US forces. He says thatninety- ninety point nine percent of US  troops conductthemselves in an exemp- exemplary manner.

That happened in when uh a US lead raid w- took on uhbasically they were looking for a terrorist took on what theysuspected was a terrorist safe house. And and the US militarysays at that point four people were killed one of them aninsurgent. But the military launched an investigation afterlocals claimed no it was eleven civilians who were killed and theBBC began airing aftermath video of the incident yesterday thatwas provided by a Sunni political group. That the networks uhshows dead bodies with gun shot wounds. On of the top commandinggenerals in Iraq earlier today discussed why he thinks theseincidents are happening. speaker1 It's difficult to pin down specifically what obviously whenyou're in the combat theater dealing with enemy combatants whodon't abide by the law of war. Who do acts of indecency. Umsolders become stressed. They become fearful. It's very difficultto determine in some cases on this battle field who is acombatant and who is a civilian. uh It doesn't excuse uh the actsthat have occurred. And we're going to look into them what Iwould say stress, fear, isolation, and in some cases um they'rethey're just upset. They see their buddies getting blown up onoccasion. uh They they uh they could snap. Kathleen_Coke Defense secretary Donald Rumpsfeld who is in Singapore for adefense leaders conference was asked about the investigations andhe said that quote, in conflicts things that shouldn't happen dohappen. And he insisted that ninety-nine point nine percent offorces in Iraq are doing the right thing. Carol. Carol_Lynn So, Kathleen where does the investigation go from here. Well,lets talk about the other two investigations of first of allHumadea there are seven US marines right now who are in the brigright in camp Pendleton in California.  Because of the shootingof an Iraqi man uh who reports say was dragged from his home wasshot and killed and then had both  a weapon and shovel planted onhim to make it appear though he was trying to uh set a road sidebomb. Now sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN  thatmilitary prosecutors will very soon file charges against theseven marines of murder uh the defense attorney for one of themen  they will also face charges of conspiracy and kidnapping. Kathleen_Coke Now this unrelated to the on going investigation into the deathsof the twenty-four Iraqi civilians, in the town of Hadisa nowthat incident took place in November. Washington Post isreporting today that investigators in that case are now hopingthat they will be able to exhume some of the bodies of the uhtwenty-four victims,  that in an effort to gain some forensicevidence. uh That could be very very helpful in theinvestigation in finding out exactly what happened they want tolook at things like the distance from which the shots were fired,the angle of the gun, and uh also the caliber- caliber of the uhbullets used and to try to figure out uh who did this and andjust how it occurred Carol. Carol_Lynn Kathleen thank you very much. Well, as Kathleen, hashaki  thatincident occurred back in March and details are only now justemerging. US forces say they were tracking an al Quaeda suspectand they came under fire and that four people were killedincluding two women and a child.

Jose_Canseco I want people to understand.  I said this many times.  My attackwas never on these athletes.  uh, I respect these athletesgreatly. What I needed was one of these athletes who I name inthe actual book who are well known uh individuals to come forthand say you know what, what Jose's saying is one hundred per centtrue. um, My major attack and my and my only attack was on MajorLeague Baseball and the Player's Association. Because I thinkthat they ought to be you know, exploited and found out for uh,the corrupt methods they use, for letting steroids in the game,for endorsing steroids in the in the game of baseball. And all ofa sudden you know, Bud Segal says I don't know anything about it,I never say anything.  That's ridiculous.  It's the biggestongoing joke on the planet right now. Chris_Matthews Congressman Lynch, you're concerned about the rights of labor andcollective bargaining agreements.  And certainly many of us arehere as well in this country generally. And uh, so I respect you,so let me ask you this though. Do you think the unions have donethe job here? Is it fair to say that Canseco's got it right bysaying the Player's Association has not been aggressive ingetting rid of steroids? Steven_Lynch Well I don't think it's a union problem. Chris_Matthews Why not a union-- Steven_Lynch  Chris_Matthews Why isn't it a union problem? Steven_Lynch Well, well Chris_Matthews If they're protecting the players' rights and saying theyshouldn't be tested. You watch those lawyers in your committee.They're up there-- They were all over the place trying to defendeh, the players. Steven_Lynch Hey I'm a former union president myself and and also an attorneythat represented a lot of unions. I always thought a very stronganti-drug policy was a good thing for my union members. This isone case where they have turned a blind eye to what's going on inprofessional sports.  But that's that's not the typical positionof unions. Chris_Matthews No. Steven_Lynch They usually want a strong anti-drug policy to make a betterworkforce. Chris_Matthews Well of course, it's also for safety reasons at the workplace.But about uh b-- let's get back to MLB Major League Baseball. Doyou think Bud Segal-- Do you believe the whole major league uhestablishment has been benefitting from all these homeruns allthese years and big muscles that produce these homeruns? Steven_Lynch Absolutely.  Following the strike I think the the thing thatbrought people back to baseball was was the big homerun contestbetween Sosa and and Maguire eh. And and in a very real way,steroid use, if those two gentlemen uh, you know, were guilty ofit and there's there's some evidence that they were, uh, they putpeople back into the seats.  So baseball is benefitting by by theperformance enhancement of the individual players which whichmakes it even more troublemsome in terms of eradicating steroiduse. Chris_Matthews Congressman, when you and I were growing up in the fifties andsixties, baseball players were skinny, wiry guys.  They weighedunder two hundred pounds. Do you think it was drug use or orweight training that got them so strong and big? Steven_Lynch I I think that it's a combination of both. I I think taht there'sthere's some steroid use out there now. I think we probably haveit moving in the right direction. And I think if we come up withserious penalties like the International Olympic Commission has,that uh, we can do this. I know that Tom Davis, uh a republicanfrom Virginia and and Henry Ma-- Waxman from California have theClean Sports Act that we're we're trying to get put rhoughCongress. Chris_Matthews Yeah. Steven_Lynch So so I think I think this this may help us, this recentrevelation uh, about a player who had everything to lose but whostill apparently put steroids in his body. You know he had theHall of Fame, and the three thousand hits and the endorsements,and uh really the the respect and admiration of the entirecountry. Chris_Matthews Okay. Is Rafael Palmeiro in trouble with your committee sir? Steven_Lynch He may be.  I think it's too early to say. Chris_Matthews Okay.

Jose_Canseco I want people to understand.  I said this many times.  My attackwas never on these athletes.  uh, I respect these athletesgreatly. What I needed was one of these athletes who I name inthe actual book who are well known uh individuals to come forthand say you know what, what Jose's saying is one hundred per centtrue. um, My major attack and my and my only attack was on MajorLeague Baseball and the Player's Association. Because I thinkthat they ought to be you know, exploited and found out for uh,the corrupt methods they use, for letting steroids in the game,for endorsing steroids in the in the game of baseball. And all ofa sudden you know, Bud Segal says I don't know anything about it,I never say anything.  That's ridiculous.  It's the biggestongoing joke on the planet right now. Chris_Matthews Congressman Lynch, you're concerned about the rights of labor andcollective bargaining agreements.  And certainly many of us arehere as well in this country generally. And uh, so I respect you,so let me ask you this though. Do you think the unions have donethe job here? Is it fair to say that Canseco's got it right bysaying the Player's Association has not been aggressive ingetting rid of steroids? Steven_Lynch Well I don't think it's a union problem. Chris_Matthews Why not a union-- Steven_Lynch  Chris_Matthews Why isn't it a union problem? Steven_Lynch Well, well Chris_Matthews If they're protecting the players' rights and saying theyshouldn't be tested. You watch those lawyers in your committee.They're up there-- They were all over the place trying to defendeh, the players. Steven_Lynch Hey I'm a former union president myself and and also an attorneythat represented a lot of unions. I always thought a very stronganti-drug policy was a good thing for my union members. This isone case where they have turned a blind eye to what's going on inprofessional sports.  But that's that's not the typical positionof unions. Chris_Matthews No. Steven_Lynch They usually want a strong anti-drug policy to make a betterworkforce. Chris_Matthews Well of course, it's also for safety reasons at the workplace.But about uh b-- let's get back to MLB Major League Baseball. Doyou think Bud Segal-- Do you believe the whole major league uhestablishment has been benefitting from all these homeruns allthese years and big muscles that produce these homeruns? Steven_Lynch Absolutely.  Following the strike I think the the thing thatbrought people back to baseball was was the big homerun contestbetween Sosa and and Maguire eh. And and in a very real way,steroid use, if those two gentlemen uh, you know, were guilty ofit and there's there's some evidence that they were, uh, they putpeople back into the seats.  So baseball is benefitting by by theperformance enhancement of the individual players which whichmakes it even more troublemsome in terms of eradicating steroiduse. Chris_Matthews Congressman, when you and I were growing up in the fifties andsixties, baseball players were skinny, wiry guys.  They weighedunder two hundred pounds. Do you think it was drug use or orweight training that got them so strong and big? Steven_Lynch I I think that it's a combination of both. I I think taht there'sthere's some steroid use out there now. I think we probably haveit moving in the right direction. And I think if we come up withserious penalties like the International Olympic Commission has,that uh, we can do this. I know that Tom Davis, uh a republicanfrom Virginia and and Henry Ma-- Waxman from California have theClean Sports Act that we're we're trying to get put rhoughCongress. Chris_Matthews Yeah. Steven_Lynch So so I think I think this this may help us, this recentrevelation uh, about a player who had everything to lose but whostill apparently put steroids in his body. You know he had theHall of Fame, and the three thousand hits and the endorsements,and uh really the the respect and admiration of the entirecountry. Chris_Matthews Okay. Is Rafael Palmeiro in trouble with your committee sir? Steven_Lynch He may be.  I think it's too early to say. Chris_Matthews Okay.  Thank you very much Congressman Steven Lynch, Democrat ofMassachusetts. 2005-08-03 20:13:00

ABC was not only third, it was probably fifth out of athree network battle. It was a pathetic little news division. uhAnd we were a couple of pathetic r- young reporters who didn'tknow anything and were trying very hard to pretend that we did.uh And uh that was the source of both great amusement, but alsogreat pride uh for the two of us over the years, to be able tolook back on what it used to be and what it became. David_Gregory And it's a u- unique experience to be with a friend and acolleague where you're actually instrumental in buildingsomething. Ted_Koppel Exactly. Exactly, I mean we were we were so low on the totem polewhen we joined ABC and so hoping that we -- I mean uh uh it's asimple fact of the matter that NBC wouldn't have had us. CBSwouldn't have had us. We were much too young, much tooinexperienced. uh And it was just a great joy to be able to workat it together, and ultimately to see ABC emerge as this greatnews powerhouse. David_Gregory What captured you about his life story? So much is made about thefact that he didn't graduate high school. uh He he had a crack atthe big job and it didn't go so well early on and then he gets ituh later on in his career. Ted_Koppel Yeah. um uh W- what really got me about Peter was thedetermination he had to make up for what he would have been thefirst to admit was a huge mistake. He dropped out of high schoolwhen he was a sophmore. uh He was so eager to get to work inbroadcasting and, as he himself put it, bone lazy when it came toschoolwork that he spent the rest of his life catching up andboy, did he. Peter Jennings was the best self- educated man Ihave ever known. Whenever he would come into a new city overseas,he would make it a point to contact whoever the smartest peoplein town were, whether those were politicians, or military people,or other journalists, or academics. And he would invite thesepeople out for a drink or invite them out to dinner. And Peter'sgreat quality was that he had this capacity of making you feelthat he was so interested in what you were saying and he wasn'tfaking it, he really was. When he traveled, he traveled with anextra suitcase that was always filled with books. So Petereducated, continued to educate himself, all the while he wasalive. So he had a lousy formal education and a brilliant homeschooling. David_Gregory I I had a mentor tell me early on that if you can do an easy testabout whether you want to be a reporter. He said, are yougenuinely curious about things? And that was certainly him. Ted_Koppel Yeah. Absolutely, he was genuinely genuinely curious and he wasjust fascinated by people who knew more than he did and he soppedit up like a sponge. David_Gregory Tell me something about him that would not be apparent if youwere just a lifelong viewer. Ted_Koppel um This very cool, aloof, controlled anchorman was a real softie,I mean a genuinely sentimental, loving human being. uh uh I uh Iremember one time, he and I were in New York, very young, in ourtwenties, and uh we were stopped by a panhandler and both of usreached into our pockets and gave the guy a buck and I moved onand Peter did not. He stopped and talked to the man for about tenminutes. And uh I realized that what Peter doing was a fargreater act of charity than what I had just done and it reallywasn't even charity. He felt that uh what this man needed was thedignity of recognition, the dignity of someone paying attentionto him, talking to him as an individual, not just someone to behanded a dollar and ignored. And that was -- that little story, Ithink, tells more about who Peter Jennings was uh than maybe muchof what was seen on the air. David_Gregory What about his view of the world and his experience, particularlyin the Middle East, as a young correspondent for ABC news and howthat informed his later reporting, how it informed his role as aneditor and an anchor, ultimately, with nine eleven and i- in thewake of nine eleven? How did all of that come together? Ted_Koppel Peter, you have to remember, was the first uh American televisionbureau chief in the Arab world. When he and ABC news set up thatbureau in Beirut there was no other network news bureau anywherein the Arab world. And that meant that Peter was covering a storythat was almost entirely covered on television from the Israeliside, but Peter was covering it frequently from the Arab side. Hewas often and unfairly portrayed as being anti-Israeli. He wasnot. He really was not. uh And uh i- i- there was just a greatfundemental decency to him. And a determination that, difficultas it might be, uh that he believed, not that every story hasequal and opposite uh uh points of view that are equallylegitimate, but that the Arab side of the story deserved to betold and he was determined to do that. And that informed everystory that Peter ever covered. He was always interested inknowing what else is there to it? What is the other point ofview? David_Gregory Did he care about something more than anything else? Ted_Koppel I'm sure he did. I don't know what it was. David_Gregory As a j- -- as a journalist? Ted_Koppel uh He cared about context. He cared about fairness. He caredabout making sure that uh that people understood more than justthe the quick surface story. uh You know, as you know, being inthe business, uh his greatest gift as an anchor was to appearunruffled and to be able to give context to a story at a timethat some guy's yelling in his ear that if you don't go to guestnumber one, he's going to walk out. We've got thirty secondsbefore you have to go to this live shot that we have coming infrom wherever it is. There might be people handing you cards fromleft and right and yet the impression that Peter conveyed wasthat he was always completely in control, uh had a an absolutesense of where he was coming from and where he was going. uh Andon top of all of that, he was a soothing presence that was almostunique. I don't think there's another anchor out there who was asgood at that as Peter Jennings. David_Gregory In his sickness and then in his death, he was so dignified and uhbut yo- uh I can't imagine but wondering what these last terriblemonths have been like for him personally. Ted_Koppel um eh He was fighting it until the very end and I think wasdetermined to believe that uh that he could still beat it. uh Idon't know at precisely what point he came to the conclusion thathe would not uh but I do know that I was with him about ten daysago and um asked him whether he wanted to talk about death anddying and, for the first time, he said yes. So I have a prettygood sense that, certainly a couple of weeks ago, Peter must haveknown uh but he was determined not to give up as long as therewas any chance. David_Gregory Are you willing to share some of his thoughts about dying? Ted_Koppel No. David_Gregory Was he angry? Did he accept it? Ted_Koppel No, uh he was certainly not angry. uh I I think that there aremany things he regrets. He's got uh two, uh when I say young, intheir early twenties, uh children of whom he is enormously proud.He loves -- he loved his wife Kayce dearly. uh And she was anabsolute tower of strength, has been, throughout this entireprocess. uh He had a great deal to live for, uh but he he alwayssaid, and I am sure meant it, that he had lived a very very goodand full life. uh And so I think, perhaps in one small portion ofhis brain, he was willing to accept that he had packed more intosixty-seven years than some people pack into ninety-seven. 2005-08-08 19:08:44

Condoleezza_Rice Well we're not yet at the stage where we're seeking sanctions. uhWhat we're doing now is uh we're seeking a presidential statementthat would make clear to Iran the international community'sdetermination that it live up to the obligations that everyonethinks Iran has. We're working through it. uh We have a s- -- thesame strategy here. We have the same uh view of the problem. TheRussians do not want a nuclear rec- weapon in Iran either. It'sbeen very clear in everything that they have tried to do, in theway that they set up the civil nuclear cooporation with Bushehr,in what they offered the Iranians, that the Russians also do notbelieve that there should be enrichment and reprocessingcapability on Iranian soil. And uh enrichment and reprocessingcapability is the core here. If you're able to enrich andreprocess, then the ability to build a bomb is is there. And sowe and the Russians, uh the Chinese, and certainly the Europeanshave the same view of what is -- what is to be prevented. uh Yes,we've had some tactical differences on how to get there, but uh Italked with my Russian counterpart uh on Friday. We agreed thatour people would go back and work very hard this weekend andwe'll see where we are on Monday. um We're considering whether itmight be a good idea to get, um after we have a presidentialstatement, uh get ministers together again uh with the the Pfive, the permanent five of the security council, plus Germany uhto talk about charting a course forward. Because everybody takesvery seriously Iran's intransigence and Iran's unwillingness uhto do what the international community is bid- -- is uhdetermined that it will do. Tim_Russert It is the policy of our government that Iran will not be allowedto develop a nuclear weapon. Condoleezza_Rice I- i- Tim, Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.That is the view of the international community, not just theUnited States. Tim_Russert This article is in the New York Times. The reality is that mostof us think the Iranians are probably going to get a weapon orthe technology to make one sooner or later an administrationofficial acknowledged a few weeks ago, refusing to talk on therecord, because such an admission amounts to a concession thatdragging Iran in front of the United Nations Security Council mayprove an exercise in futility. The optomists around here, aboutthe white house, just hope we can delay the day by ten or twentyyears and that by that time we'll have a different relationshipwith a different Iranian government. That seems like a muchdifferent policy. Condoleezza_Rice Well I -- since I don't know who this anonymous person is, Ican't tell you what uh w- what relationship they may have to thepolicy. I'll tell you who doesn't think that. I don't believe uhthat. I don't believe that the president believes that becausewe're doing everything that we can to uh send a strong signal tothe Iranians that they have no choice. If they wish to be a partof the international community, they have no choice but to giveup ambitions that could lead to the technologies that would leadto a nuclear weapon. uh If the international community staysreally solid here, Iran cannot stand the kind of isolation fromthe international community that, for instance, North Koreaendures almost by choice. We really do have a chance to solvethis diplomatically, but Tim, I would be the first to say wecan't afford to waste time. That's why we need our our people inin New York to really work toward this first phase. We need tosee if that has a an effect on the Iranians and, if it does nothave an effect on the Iranians, we need to move to the nextphase. Tim_Russert Which is? Condoleezza_Rice The next phase is uh to look to uh further uh options in thesecurity council. For instance, perhaps the chapter sevenresolution. Tim_Russert Which is? Condoleezza_Rice Chapter seven resolution essentially gives uh the UN or thesecurity council the ability to compel a state to act. uh It i-can um say that there would be consequences if actions are nottaken. Tim_Russert Including military? Condoleezza_Rice Well uh no one ever takes anything off the table, but I believewe're a long way from uh from that. We have the possibilities offinancial measures that could be taken, uh bans against travel.There are -- there are a lot of uh options once you're in thesecurity council. That's why it was very important to get this uhdossier Iranian dossier to the security council and why thediplomacy that we've been working over the last uh couple ofyears to get the Europeans and the United States on the same pageand to now bring the Russians and the Chinese along uh has beenso important. Tim_Russert D- do you believe if the president chose to embark on militaryaction with Iran, he would go to Congress for authorizationfirst? Condoleezza_Rice I'm not going to speculate on that. The president uh v- is uh v-clear that he keeps all of his options on the table. But Tim, Ithink speculating about how we might uh set up military actionisn't helpful at a time when we really are concentrating on thediplomacy. But I want to be very clear. Tim_Russert But you wouldn't go to Congress? Condoleezza_Rice Well eh Tim, of course the uh administration went to Congress uhthe last time. And I would just uh ask people to look at thehistory of how this president has uh has acted. He has uh takenCongress as a full partner in these matters, but I'm not going toget into a discussion of what the president may or may not do uhconstitutionally.

Woundedinjured seventeen thousand two hundred seventy-one. Iraqis killedan estimate num- -- estimated number is thirty thousand. Hundredand thirty thousand American troops on the ground. When you wereplanning the war some three and a half years ago, did you haveany idea that, three years into the war, those are the numbersthat you would be confronting? Condoleezza_Rice Well I certainly thought that it would be difficult. um I don'tthink anyone um knew precisely what we would be facing in termsof numbers. And, look, every one of those deaths is uh mourned bypeople in the administration. uh because these are families thathave lost um husbands and wives and daughters and sons. um But wealso know that nothing of value is ever won without sacrifice.We're in Iraq because the um United States of America faces adifferent kind of enemy and a different kind of war. And we haveto have a different kind of Middle East if we're ever going toresolve the uh the the problems of an ideology of hatred that wasso great that people flew airplanes into buildings. Iraq was a --Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a threat., Now that the -- Tim_Russert B- but but Saddam was not related to flying airplanes intobuildings. Condoleezza_Rice No, and we have never said that Saddam -- u- uh Saddam was notrelated to the events of September eleventh. But if you reallybelieve that the only thing that happened on September eleventhwas people flew airplanes into buildings, I think you have a verynarrow view of what we faced on September eleventh. We faced theum the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout the MiddleEast that had to be dealt with. Saddam Hussein was a part of thatold Middle East. The new Iraq will be a part of a new Middle Eastand we will all be safer. Tim_Russert But Madame Secretary, weapons of mass destruction was the primaryrationale given to go into Iraq. Lisa Myers of NBC news broke astory last week that the Iraqi foreign minister, Mister Sabri, w-became a spy for the French and and the CIA. And this is how itwas reported. Saddam Hussein's last foreign minister Naji Sabripaid spy for French intelligence later turned him over to the CIAto supply information about Iraq, it's chemical, biological,nuclear weapon program more than six months before the war beganin March of oh three, according former intelligence officials.The sources said he provided information Iraqi dictator hadambitions for a nuclear program but it was not active. And thatno biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled althoughresearch was under way. That's a far cry from what the Americanpeople were told. Condoleezza_Rice Of course, Tim, this was a single source among multiple sources.And the problem was that Saddam Hussein was unwilling, aftermultiple revel- resolutions in the security council, to accountfor his uh weapons programs. uh We all remember that theaccounting of the UN mission that was suppo- -- uh weaponsinspection mission that was supposed to uh look into its weaponsprogram could not account for large stockpiles. We all thoughtthat Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He certainlyhad a a very healthy appetite for them and he had used thembefore, both against his own people and against his neighbors. Hewas a threat. This was someone flying uh against our aircraft  oror i- -- shooting at our aircraft as they flew the no fly zone.He'd invaded his neighbors. But the point is that, now that he'sgone, Iraq has an opportunity to be a different Iraq in adifferent kind of Middle East. I know it's hard. And I know thatthe numbers that you've put up are difficult to see. And I knowthat the violence on TV is difficult. But I would ask people touh to look at the perspective here of what is really going on inIraq. Under this uh the violence -- under the specter of thisviolence, you have Iraqis now, Sunni, Shia, Kurds, and others,determined to form a government of national unity. That'sextraordinary in Iraq's history, where they've always settledtheir differences by violence, not by politics. And when theysucceed in that, you uh they are going to have the basis for avery uh  different kind of Iraq and I think they're going tosucceed. Tim_Russert But people are being asked to take your judgement on this, as wesit here this morning, and refer to previous judgements theadministration made. Weapons of mass destruction, there werenone. We would be greeted as liberators, this is three yearslater. That th- it would not take hundreds of thousands ofAmerican troops to occupy Iraq. Tommy Franks, according to thebook Cobra Two said we'd be down to thirty thousand troops inNovember of oh three. The cost of the war, the budget director ofthe white house said it'd be fifty billion dollars. It's now overthree hundred and fifty billion dollars. Each judgement hasproven to be wrong. Condoleezza_Rice The judgement that has not proven to be wrong, uh Tim, is thatthe region is changing in fundemental ways and the region isbetter without Saddam Hussein. Yes, it is true that uh everyonethought he had weapons of mass destruction. He did not. It is, bythe way, the case that the Iraqis are delighted to be rid of him.And some Iraqis, uh most Iraqis in fact, uh are willing and uhwant to keep coalition forces there until they can uh take careof this themselves. But we do have to keep things in historicalperspective. These people are doing something that is quiteunknown in the Middle East and one has to ask, what was thealternative? Was the alternative to leave Saddam Hussein in poweruh continuing to threaten his neighbors, continuing with his uhwindfall profits from the oil for food scandal, continuing torepress uh his people and build mass graves, uh continuing to uhuse those oil for food profits to again build the infrastructurefor his weapons of mass destruction? Tim_Russert But many will say he was contained by the no fly zone. Condoleezza_Rice ah I don't think that there is anyone -- I I do not think that hewas in a box. Tim_Russert He was in a box. Condoleezza_Rice It i- -- the oil for food program alone shows that the billionsof dollars that he was collecting -- he was not just going tobuild palaces. This was someone who had an insatiable appetite uhto dominate his region. Now, without Saddam Hussein, you can lookacross the region and see that uh a lot is changing thanks to thepresident's democracy uh promotion and the hard work of people inthose countries. You have Syrian forces out of Lebanon. You haveuh Saddam Hussein out of uh Iraq. The people of the Middle Eastare taking on authoritarian governments across the Middle East.Kuwait has given women the right to vote. I'd be the first to saythat these big historical changes are turbulent and they'redifficult. But the notion that somehow there was a placid MiddleEast that, if we just left it alone, if we'd just not invadedIraq, if we had just not overthrown dictators, if we just notchallenged Syrian power in Lebanon, everything would be just fineuh is simply not true. It was that Middle East, the malignancy ofthe Middle East that we quote unquote disturbed, that leddirectly to the September eleventh event. Tim_Russert The president said this week that whether there'll be troops inIraq for the f- unforeseeable future will be determined by thenext president, meaning we're going to have troops in Iraq atleast through January of oh nine. Condoleezza_Rice Oh the president was asked this question in a particular way andhe e- answered that uh some American troops may well be there forthe next president. But I would just point to what uh thepresident has said continually, which is that American forces aregoing to come down uh commensurate with the need as Iraqi forcesstand up and they are indeed standing up. General Casey hastalked about a significant reduction of American forces over thenext year and that significant reduction is because Iraqi forcesare taking and holding territory now because, during this mostrecent uptick of sectarian violence, the Iraqi army uh uh behavedvery very well. So Iraqi forces are getting better, Americanforces are ceding territory, and I think it's entirely uhprobable that we will see a significant draw down of Americanforces over the next uh -- next year. That's what General Caseybelieves. Tim_Russert Was -- this year. Condoleezza_Rice It's all dependent on the ground but this i- -- on on events onthe ground, but as General Casey has said, we see the progresswith Iraqi forces. We see the progress of the political process.And uh there's every reason to believe that American forces canstart to draw down. Tim_Russert Is the insurgency in its last throes? Condoleezza_Rice Well the insurgency, uh politicially, is certainly in in danger,because the Sunnis who stood outside of the political process. Tim_Russert But in terms of violence, is it in its last throes? Condoleezza_Rice Well i- the insurgency is still able to uh to pull off violenceand kill innocent children or kill an innocent school teacher.Yes, they are able to do that and they might be able to do thatsome ti- -- for some time. But what they've not been able to dois to disrupt the political process. What they've not been ableto do is to set Iraqis uh one against another in the politicalprocess. They've not been able to stop three elections. They'renot able to stop formation of uh the government. uh A few violentpeople can always uh grab headlines and can always kill innocentpeople. Tim_Russert It's more than a few. Condoleezza_Rice Well, it's a few in terms of the population of Iraqis. Tim_Russert But it could not exist without being enabled by the population. Condoleezza_Rice Well the population is less and less enabling every day. Thereare reports that Zarqawi and al-Qaeda meet stiff resistance,indeed violent resistance, from Iraqi tribes. Sunnis are now apart of the political process. And I know that people wonder whenwill the government formation finish. uh It it seems to bedragging on after the election. But I would just note, I read theother day someone said well, they're dividing up the spoils ofthe offices. That's not what they're doing in this process. Theyare writing a government program on which the national unity willgovern. They are writing the rules by which they will govern. Andthey're defi- they're trying to determining who will take keypositions. So, this is uh an extraordinary matter, anextraordinary scene with Iraqis, Sunni and Shia and Kurds allworking together toward a unity government. 2006-03-26 22:31:10
