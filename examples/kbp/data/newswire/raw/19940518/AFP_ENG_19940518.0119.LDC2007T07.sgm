Berlusconi government faces confidence vote by Beatrice Bretonniere
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of conservative and centrist senators held the future of
Italian Prime Minsiter Silvio Berlusconi's government in the balance
Wednesday as he faced a confidence vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The senators are opposed to the presence of five neofascists in
Berlusconi's government, which is eight votes short of an absolute
majority of the 324 senators, and could vote against him on the the
confidence motion due late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If Berlusconi fails to garner the needed votes, his government would
collapse, forcing President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to either ask him to
form a new cabinet or call new elections that could plunge the country
into crisis.
</P>
<P>
But analysts and the Italian media said that scenario was unlikely as
Italy's former Christian Democrat leaders who hold the deciding Senate
votes would not want to be blamed for such a crisis.
</P>
<P>
They said Berlusconi's best chance of winning the vote was if several
of the opposing senators from the Italian Popular Party (PPI),
comprised of the former Christian Democrats, simply abstain from
voting, as several have hinted they may do.
</P>
<P>
Christian-Democratic Senator Luigi Grillo has called for a "technical
abstention" in order to allow the new cabinet to begin operating, two
months after Berlusconi's rightwing Freedom Alliance coalition swept
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile another senator, Pietro Giurickovic, from the small leftist
Democratic Alliance, claimed that Berlusconi's Forza Italia party had
promised him the presidency of a parliamentary commission if he helped
the Freedom Alliance government win the confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
He said he declined the offer which was made even before Berlusconi
had picked his cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Forza Italia has denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Observers said even if Berlusconi wins the confidence vote Wednesday,
his government faces a tug of war with the opposition everytime it
needs to pass legislation through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Forza Italia and its coalition partners, the federalist Northern
League and the neo-Fascist National Alliance, hold an absolute
majority in the lower chamber of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nicola Mancino, the head of the PPI which holds 34 seats in the
Senate, on Tuesday urged a "change in the majority," proposing that
Berlusconi break with the National Alliance and form a new coalition
government with the centrist and some center-left parties.
</P>
<P>
Mancino said the National Alliance, created by Gianfranco Fini, the
general secretary of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, was "a
source of concern."
</P>
<P>
He also called on Berlusconi to divest himself of private business
interests within "one or two months at the most" in order to limit any
conflicts of interest for the millionaire media magnate and
politician.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi's Fininvest communications group is Italy's second largest
business with interests ranging from television and the media to the
AC Milan football club.
</P>
<P>
The new premier was due to respond to his critics' concerns in an
address to the Senate shortly before Wednesday's confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
In a policy statement to parliament on Monday, Berlusconi conceded
"legitimate concerns" over the presence of the five neo-fascists in
his cabinet, but pledged his right-wing coalition would adhere to
Italy's democratic structures.
