Khamenei firmly in power five years after Khomeini's death by

<P>
Five years after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, his
successor spiritual guide Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has kept a firm hold
on political and religious power despite factional quarrels and
leadership challenges from the conservative clergy.
</P>
<P>
"Obeying the guide is the same as obeying the Imam," is a slogan often
heard in Iran, illustrating efforts by rulers to establish Khamenei as
Iran's highest authority and legimate heir to the founder of the
Islamic republic, who died five years ago on Saturday, June 4.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei himself has overcome doubts about his ability to replace the
late charismatic leader, and at times appears even to have surpassed
his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the organizers of the anniversary of Khomeini's
death last week, the leader urged them to "avoid exaggerations and
stick to facts" in describing his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei was an unlikely choice to replace Khomeini because of his
lack of the required religious credentials.
</P>
<P>
However, he was unanimously elected as spiritual leader after the
country's top-ranking religious officials granted him the honorary
title of "Ayatollah".
</P>
<P>
Many observers at the time predicted a diminished power for the new
spiritual guide, especially after Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani took
over as president.
</P>
<P>
Spousing liberal political and economic ideas, Rafsanjani dominated
the power scene until 1991, while Khamenei played a behind-the-scenes
role as the guardian of revolutionary and Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
However, rising social and economic problems which followed
Rafsanjani's market-reform programs, have prompted the leader to exert
more influence in policy-making, with the backing of the conservative-
dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Khomeini who generally avoided executive functions,
Khamenei is openly involved in decision-making and often issues
directives or advice to the government.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the late leader, Khamenei also pays frequent domestic visits
and holds official meetings with foreign dignitaries visiting Iran.
</P>
<P>
Considered as a fair arbiter among various factions within the
political establishment, Khamenei has been able to assert himself as a
pivotal figure and a source of emulation for many officials, including
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Government offices are obliged to display the portraits of Khamenei,
often along with those of Khomeini, while Rafsanjani's pictures appear
in public at random.
</P>
<P>
The leader supporters, particularly in the parliament often address
him with the title "Imam," an honor previously reserved for Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
But while Khamenei's political power is unchallenged, his holding
absolute religious authority is still contested by some clergy in
conservative circles, who are opposed to the concept of
Velayat-e-Faqih (religious government).
</P>
<P>
Velayat, which calls for one single figure or entity to serve as both
religious and political leader in a Shiite Moslem state, has been
opposed on grounds that political failures could badly reflect on
people's faith in religion.
</P>
<P>
Differences surfaced late last year when several top officials
demanded that Khamenei be chosen as a Marja-e-Taqlid (the source of
religious reference in Shiite Islam) while keeping his post as leader.
</P>
<P>
A leading conservative clergyman, Ayatollah Ahmad Azari Qomi, said
recently that Khamenei "possessed all the right qualities" to become a
Marja, but on the condition that he excelled other candidates in
religious learnings.
</P>
<P>
To overcome such opposition, Khamenei has since two years ago
undertaken the unprecedented task to reform schools of theology in
Iran and tried to bring the traditionally independent institutions
under government supervision.
