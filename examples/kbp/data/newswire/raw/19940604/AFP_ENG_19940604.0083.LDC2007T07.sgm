(picture) Six condemned to death for plotting to kill Bush by Mohammed

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Iraqis and a Kuwaiti were condemned to death here Saturday for
plotting to assassinate former US president George Bush, Iraq's arch-
foe during the Gulf War, with a car bomb in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's state security court also jailed seven others for between six
months and 12 years, while the last of the 14 defendants, a Kuwaiti,
was acquitted at the end of a year-long trial.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, 11 Iraqis and three Kuwaitis, have the right to
appeal. The emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, can
commute the death sentences to prison terms or pardon the convicts.
</P>
<P>
The six who were given the death penalty, seated in a metal cage and
with their heads shaved, listened quietly as Judge Saleh al-Fahd
announced the verdict.
</P>
<P>
But then Ahmad Jabber Habib, an Iraqi who was jailed for 12 years,
hurled himself at the other defendants and cried out, "It's all your
fault I'm here."
</P>
<P>
The two Iraqis singled out by the prosecution as the ringleaders of a
plot against Bush allegedly hatched by Iraqi intelligence -- Raad al-
Assadi, 33, and Wali al-Ghazali, 36 -- were among those sent to death
row.
</P>
<P>
The others were Salem Nasser al-Shammari, 34, Bandar Ajil, 24, and
Adel Ismail Otaibi, 40. The Kuwaiti sentenced to death was 30-year-old
Badr al-Shammari.
</P>
<P>
The judge insisted the verdict took no account of the nationality of
the accused and that there was "no outside pressure."
</P>
<P>
"The court came to its verdict in all freedom and based solely on
material proof," such as the arms and explosives found in the
possession of the suspects, Fahd told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The trial on the plot to kill Bush during a visit to the emirate
opened on June 5, 1993, and was based mostly on the testimony of a
Kuwaiti intelligence officer.
</P>
<P>
The court delayed its verdict several times, saying it wanted to give
the defence more time to examine the testimony. The prosecutor general
demanded the death penalty for all the Iraqis and one of the Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, arrested a few days after Bush's visit, were charged
with planning to carry out a car-bomb attack against the former US
leader, on the orders of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has denied any involvement in the affair.
</P>
<P>
But after a US investigation into the plot, Washington launched a
cruise missile attack on the Iraqi intelligence headquarters in
Baghdad on June 27, 1993. Iraq said six people were killed in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
During the Bush administration, US-led multinational coalition forces
drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in February 1991 after seven months
of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Among those jailed, Ahmad Jabbar Habib from Iraq was sentenced to 12
years for possession of arms and alcohol, which is banned in Kuwait on
Islamic grounds.
</P>
<P>
A 73-year-old Iraqi, Ali Khodair al-Baddai, was given four years for
illegal possession of weapons. Four other Iraqis were sentenced to six
months each for illegal entry into the country.
</P>
<P>
Nasser al-Mil, a 43-year-old, was allowed to walk free.
