Fighting eases after latest ceasefire call by Maher Chmaytelli
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fighting eased in southern Yemen Saturday after a declaration of a new
ceasefire by President Ali Abdallah Saleh in a bid to end Yemen's
five-week-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Northern units loyal to the president halted their bombardment of the
southern stronghold of Aden and nearby villages, where at least seven
people were killed and 22 wounded on Friday, an AFP correspondent in
the city said.
</P>
<P>
Only intermittent shelling was reported from the frontlines between 15
and 20 kilometres (nine and 12 miles) outside the besieged city,
following the call for a midnight Friday (2100 GMT) ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The government in Sanaa proposed a joint military commission to
supervise the ceasefire but southern leaders have insisted on
international observers.
</P>
<P>
"The joint military commission formed at the time of unity no longer
exists," said the leadership of the self-declared Yemen Democratic
Republic (YDR).
</P>
<P>
UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, meanwhile, arrived in the Saudi city
of Jeddah from Amman after holding talks earlier this week in Sanaa as
part of a peace mission. He also aims to meet southern leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a northern spokesman said the president had presented the
United Nations with a proposal for a new ceasefire in compliance with
UN Security Council Resolution 924, adopted on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission was to hold its first meeting at the frontline at
Gool, between Sabr and Dar Saad villages, at 11:00 a.m. (0800 GMT)
Saturday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The commission was formed under a February accord reached in Jordan
and aimed at ending a political crisis between the north and south.
But the row erupted into civil war on May 5.
</P>
<P>
Saleh's southern rival and former vice president, Ali Salem al-Baid,
declared the YDR on May 21, four years after North and South Yemen
merged to form a fragile union.
</P>
<P>
Two other truces this week have broken down, with each side accusing
the other of failing to honour pledges.
</P>
<P>
Southern officials said on Aden television late Friday that they had
recaptured most of the eastern oil-producing Shabwa province from
northern forces after heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
Regional Governor Ahmad Farid as-Sarimah said southern forces, backed
by tribal groups, were "cleaning up pockets of resistance around Al-
Ataq," the area's main town and a major military base.
</P>
<P>
It was captured by the north at the end of May.
