Berlusconi gets Kohl seal of approval, but fascist row simmers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi received a warm welcome
Thursday from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and brushed aside German
opposition outrage over the presence of neo-fascists in the Rome
government.
</P>
<P>
"I wish you luck with your work and God's help," Kohl told Berlusconi,
who was received with military honours on his first official visit
abroad. The German leader said his Italian counterpart was "assuming a
great responsibility at an important moment in his country's history."
</P>
<P>
A tanned and smiling Berlusconi said he was "particularly satisfied"
that his first visit abroad since taking power in May had brought him
to Germany. Prior to his visit, he had sent a message of
congratulation to Kohl, whose government scored a big win in last
weekend's European elections.
</P>
<P>
Responding to German opposition criticism of the neo-fascists in his
government, Berlusconi defended his team saying "their behavior and
conscience are absolutely democratic."
</P>
<P>
Among other issues, he and Kohl discussed the European Union summit
which opens in Greece on June 24, as well as the G7 summit which Italy
will host in Naples from July 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Dieter Vogel said Berlusconi was behind an
initiative on security in eastern European nuclear reactors which Kohl
and French President Francois Mitterrand expect to sponsor at the G7
meeting of the world's most industrialised nations. That initiative
will also deal with the issue of whether Ukraine's reactor at
Chernobyl should be closed down.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi had additionally been expected to sound out Kohl's views on
the Italian premier's Forza Italia party joining a party group in the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Both Forza Italia and Kohl's Christian Democratic Union fared well in
last weekend's Euro-poll. Berlusconi wants the 27 deputies elected
from his party to join the centre-right European People's Party in the
Strasbourg assembly, which combines the conservative and Christian
Democratic parties from across Europe.
</P>
<P>
With its 47 members, Kohl's own CDU has the lion's share of PPE
mandates in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
But after his talks, Berlusconi said his Euro-deputies would not for
the time being join any parliamentary group. He did not rule out their
forming a group of their own.
</P>
<P>
German Social Democratic and Green opposition parties earlier called
on Kohl and his party to refuse to allow Forza Italia deputies to join
the PPE group.
</P>
<P>
A senior Social Democratic official said Kohl should have taken the
opportunity to "voice democratic Germany's worries over the entry of
neo-fascist ministers into the Italian government."
</P>
<P>
One opposition deputy said supporting Forza Italia's entry into the
PPE would amount to "becoming allies of the neo-fascists" in the
Italian government, which contains five ministers from the neo-fascist
National Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, led by Gianfranco Fini, is one of three members of the
rightwing Berlusconi-led alliance which took power in May.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi responded to the criticisms by saying there were "few
people in Italy who can put forward a better pro-democracy record than
mine."
</P>
<P>
"I will not allow anybody the right to say my government's five
ministers are fascists," he added. "Their behaviour and conscience are
absolutely democratic."
