Herat province governor on peace mission, to meet Hekmatyar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ismael Khan, a top commander and governor of Herat province, was to
meet Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar on Monday to discuss
his formula for ending five months of fighting, his aide said.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Khan had met with embattled President Burhanuddin Rabbani and a
pro-Saudi Arabian leader, Rasul Sayyaf of the Ittehad-i-Islami
faction, since arriving Thursday on a peace mission, the aide added.
</P>
<P>
He said Ismael Khan was seeking a negotiated settlement of the
fighting between the forces of Rabbani and Hekmatyar which has raged
since an aborted January 1 coup staged by the president's former
communist ally, General Abdul Rashid Dostam.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani has survived but the battle for Kabul has claimed more than
2,500 lives, while some 17,000 people have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
"If Ismael Khan's current efforts fail, Kabul will be plunged into a
new and bitter round of fighting," warned his aide, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Herat governor was to meet Hekmatyar at his headquarters in the
eastern district of Charasiab. A close associate of Rabbani, Ismael
Khan will impress upon Hekmatyar that his mission offered a last
opportunity to end the fighting, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Khan has refused to talk with journalists but his aides said he
planned to hold a press conference after completing his series of
talks with feuding leaders.
</P>
<P>
He is also likely to meet Ali Mazari of the pro-Iranian Hezb-i-Wahdat,
a group of Shiite Moslems who are indirectly siding with Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Ismael Khan's delegation, comprising officials from several
western provinces, said the peace mission had taken on special
importance following the recent apparent rejection of special UN envoy
Mehmoud Mestiri's peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said Mestiri was planning to propose the return of
former king Zaher Shah from exile in Rome as an interim arrangement,
but aides to Rabbani and Hekmatyar said they both rejected the idea.
