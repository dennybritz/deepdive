Saudis incapable of organizing Mecca on their own: Iran
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moslem states should join forces to organize the annual pilgrimage to
Mecca because Saudi Arabia alone is incapable of protecting the
pilgrims, an Iranian official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deputy speaker of parliament, Hassan Ruhani, said Saudi
incompetence was to blame for the latest tragedy, in which 270
pilgrims were killed Monday in a stampede during a ritual at Mina, 10
kilometres (six miles) from Mecca.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia is not able to manage the event by itself ... We ask
Riyadh to allow the ceremonies to be organised collectively by Islamic
countries," he said during Friday prayers at Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
Ruhani said Iran was ready to help Saudi Arabia in organising the
yearly pilgrimage known as the hajj, which every Moslem is expected to
perform at least once in his lifetime if he can afford it.
</P>
<P>
"Every year we have tragedies occurring in Mecca," said Ruhani, who is
also the secretary of the National Security Council, the highest
decision-making body in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"With help, so many innocent pilgrims would not have died and the
ceremonies would have proceeded in a lot more orderly fashion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities have blamed the stampede on the "record number"
of pilgrims, who numbered more than 1.5 million at the site.
</P>
<P>
An official Saudi spokesman said Thursday that the pilgrims had failed
"to follow instructions" given at the ritual, which entails throwing
stones at steles representing Satan.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrimage to Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, one of the five
pillars of Islam, has been marked by several accidents in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
In July 1990, more than 1,400 pilgrims were killed in a stampede in a
tunnel at Mina, and in 1987, clashes between Saudi police and Iranian
pilgrims left 402 dead including 275 Iranians.
</P>
<P>
The deputy speaker of parliament also accused Riyadh of provoking the
civil war in Yemen "because Saudi Arabia is afraid of having a strong
neighbour at its side."
</P>
<P>
"Fratricide in Yemen is not in the interest of Saudi Arabia or the
region," Ruhani said.
