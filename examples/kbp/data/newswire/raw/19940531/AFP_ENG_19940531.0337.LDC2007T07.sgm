Berlusconi reorganises party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Tuesday announced a
reorganization of Forza Italia, the political party he created five
months ago which is now made up of at least 13,000 clubs.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi told a meeting of the Forza senators group that the
founding "coordinating committee" would be enlarged.
</P>
<P>
It would be broadened to include the heads of the party's two
parliamentary groups, he said. Eighteen issue-based departments would
also be created.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen out of the 18 departments would be mirror existing
parliamentary commissions and would supply research work to the
party's deputies, Berlusconi said.
</P>
<P>
Gianni Pilo, a Forza deputy, told AFP the objective was to "create an
entity the heart of which works democratically."
</P>
<P>
The idea is "not to transform Forza Italia into a party but to make it
a very open, supple movement."
</P>
<P>
Showing some splits in the ranks, however, Tiziana Parenti, a Forza MP
and candidate to the powerful parliamentary anti-Mafia committee told
a press conference she hoped Forza would become "a structured party in
order to obtain more transparency within the democratic game."
