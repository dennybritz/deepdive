Greece set to adopt measures to protect Greek Albanian minority
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Greece is determined to take "drastic measures" to protect the
interests of the Greek minority in Albania, Foreign Minister Carolos
Papoulias said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Papoulias was responding to an overture made Monday by Albanian
President Sali Berisha who indicated his willingness to resume talks
with Greece over the status of the ethnic Greek minority in a part of
southern Albania which Greek nationalists claim belongs to Greece.
</P>
<P>
"The latest crackdown against the Greek minority have changed the
climate, and we will not accept to pursue a dialogue considering the
conditions under which the Greek minority is living," Papoulias said.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he was not rejecting talks on the issue but
that such a dialogue had to be prepared in advance.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Albanian government has understood what is in its best
interest," Papoulias said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister warned Monday that Athens would close its border
to Albanian migrant workers if bilateral relations continued to
deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Greek Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis visited the
Greek-Albanian border to insure that armed troops posted there were
"fulfilling their duty."
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to tour villages affected by the influx of migrant
workers and would look at ways to "ensure better border protection."
</P>
<P>
Greece has persistently accused Albania of persecuting its Greek
minority, estimated by Athens to number 400,000 but put at just 60,000
by Albanian authorities.
