South puts up strong resistance to north's drive on Aden by Henri

Southern Yemeni troops fought a fierce battle Tuesday to resist a
northern assault on Al-Anad air base, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
their Aden stronghold.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of bodies are scattered all over the battlefield," said a
witness, emerging from the centre of the base.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh were in control of the
northern entrance and pounded their rivals with shells, an AFP
reporter said after touring the front.
</P>
<P>
But the south's soldiers and militiamen, holding on to the southern
part of the 35-square-kilometre (14-sq.-mile) base and surrounding
hills, retaliated with Soviet-made Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers manning rocket batteries, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from
the northern lines, were in high spirits.
</P>
<P>
The north claimed Monday it had captured the base but a southern
military spokesman in Aden said the assault was driven back nearly 20
kilometers (12 miles) on Tuesday after a land counter-offensive backed
by heavy air strikes.
</P>
<P>
On the field, the commander of a southern unit deployed near Al-Anad
told AFP that "the other party is pounding the base and airport."
Southern troops had withdrawn their artillery from the base and
redeployed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the raging battle, volunteers from Aden flocked to the
southern access to the base to pick up weapons and ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
In Sanaa, a northern army spokesman said Al-Anad air base, which the
south says has 20,000 soldiers, had been "razed to the ground and
turned into a pile of ruins" since its reported capture on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The southern army units of Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid were also
trying to drive the enemy away from a crossroads leading to Aden, the
main port city of the south with more than half a million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Baid's defence lines were spread over 17 kilometers (10.2 miles) to
the south of Al-Anad, bolstered by 130-millimetre batteries with a
range of 30 kilometers (18 miles).
</P>
<P>
Multiple-rocket-launchers and anti-aicraft batteries were deployed on
the sides of the main road to Aden.
</P>
<P>
The northern units, meanwhile, also fought to break through on the
eastern front at Zinjubar, but Baid's forces were holding on to their
positions, 40 kilometers (24 miles) from Aden.
</P>
<P>
Neither side has issued a casualty toll for the conflict which erupted
on May 5, but a senior southern leader, Salim Saleh Mohammad, said in
a newspaper interview that the losses were "large and horrible."
</P>
<P>
At least 175 Somali refugees at a seafront camp have been killed in
crossfire, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is still preventing the distribution of aid to some 6,000
Somalis left behind at Al Koud refugee camp, 50 kilometres (30 miles)
from Aden, a UNHCR spokesman said in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
On the diplomatic front, an Arab League delegation returned empty-
handed from Sanaa to Cairo on Tuesday after failing to secure a
ceasefire, which the north has rejected until the south surrenders.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will win the war but there will be a political solution,
sure," said Prime Minister Haidar Abu Baqer al-Attas, a southerner.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab states and League have to practice more pressure on Ali
Abdallah Saleh to stop the war, and then people can go to dialogue
again and find a suitable political solution," he told the US
television network CNN.
</P>
<P>
"The war declared by Ali Abdallah Saleh is to strengthen his
centralism ... while unity was to form a unified country with
decentralisation and at the same time to build a modern state," said
Attas, interviewed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Conservative North Yemen and the old Marxist South merged in May 1990.
