IAEA team arrives in North Korea for crucial inspection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three inspectors from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) arrived in Pyongyang Tuesday in their latest attempt to
investigate North Korea's suspect nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the IAEA team was reported by the official Korean
Central News Agency (KCNA), which said: "Their inspection is expected
to last approximately a week."
</P>
<P>
The IAEA experts, who arrived in Pyongang by air via Beijing, are to
inspect an experimental plant in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers (55 miles)
north of the capital, that the West suspects is a nuclear bomb
factory.
</P>
<P>
A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday said the
refuelling operation had begun and the seals on the reactor's fuel
rods had been broken.
</P>
<P>
Such a move in the absence of IAEA monirots would be a violation of
agreements between the IAEA and North Korea, an IAEA official said in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA said its inspectors would be recalled immediately if they
confirmed that the refuelling had begun before their arrival.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA, the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, has insisted on
viewing the refuelling operation in order to determine if nuclear
material has been diverted for weapons production.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said the refuelling procedure could yield enough
plutonium for at least four nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA monitors -- Olli Heinonen of Finland, Vladmir Rukhlo of
Russia and Tanzania's Jamaluddin Omar -- are scheduled to inspect a
purported "radio-chemical laboratory" from which a previous IAEA
mission was shut out in March.
</P>
<P>
The North Korean decision to begin the refuelling before the
inspectors arrived led the UN Security Council chairman to demand
access to the facility.
</P>
<P>
North Korea has since told the IAEA that it was to replace fuel rods
at the five-megawatt nuclear reactor and offered to allow IAEA
inspectors to observe the operation.
</P>
<P>
But it has refused to let the IAEA sample the spent fuel to determine
whether plutonium had been diverted to a clandestine nuclear arms
programme.
</P>
<P>
KCNA said at the weekend that agency need have no fear that the fuel
had been diverted for military use, as the process was being monitored
by IAEA cameras.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang is "prepared to store all the spent fuel under the strict
surveillance of the IAEA and fully allow the IAEA to measure it," the
KCNA report quoted a North Korean foreign ministry official as saying.
