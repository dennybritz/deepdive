Dismissed Ogaden leaders arrested
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The president and vice-president of Ethiopia's rebellious eastern
Ogaden region, who were dismissed in April, have been arrested for
failing to stand down, sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Jire Qulinle and Ahmed Ali Dahir were arrested overnight
Thursday in Gode, the former administrative capital of the Ogaden,
which is inhabited mainly by ethnic Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Several sources said the two were detained by central government
security officials after they refused to hand over power to the new
president of the region, Abdurahman Ugas Muhamoud Kani.
</P>
<P>
But this was denied by the head of the local information office,
Mahamoud Dirir Geddi, who said the pair were arrested by "local
forces" on the orders of the regional authorities.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the Addis Ababa government was also behind the sacking
of the two at the beginning of April by the regional executive
committee, which accused them of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Several armed secessionist movements, mainly the Ogaden National
Liberation Front, are active in the region, opposing the transitional
government of President Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
Also last month, Ogaden authorities decided to transfer the
administrative capital to Djidjiga, which was one of the stakes in the
Ogaden war between Ethiopia and Somalia in 1977-78.
</P>
<P>
Gode is the fief of Ogadeni secessionists and the two sacked officials
were said to have close links with advocates of regional self-
determination.
</P>
<P>
Mahamoud Dirir Geddi announced Tuesday at a press conference that
elections to an Ethiopian constituent assembly, planned for June 5,
could after all take place in the Ogaden in spite of what he described
as "logistic" difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The elected assembly is due to pass a new constitution for Ethiopia,
which has been in transition since the May 1991 overthrow of Colonel
Mengistu Haile Mariam, now exiled in Zimbabwe.
