Fighting around Aden as UN envoy draws up compromise for truce by
Maher Chmaytelli
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Artillery battles raged on all fronts around the south's bastion of
Aden on Tuesday, as UN peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi revealed a
compromise plan to halt fighting in Yemen's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Northern and southern troops traded artillery fire around this key
port city, after heavy shelling Monday which hospital officials in
Aden say killed 10 people and wounded 57 more.
</P>
<P>
Chronic water shortages since northern forces bombed a pumping station
at Bir Nasser, 15 kilometers (nine miles) away, also put the city's
500,000 inhabitants at risk of a typhoid epidemic, medical aid workers
warned.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, visiting the United Arab Emirates, told AFP he was drawing up
a compromise plan to secure a ceasefire which he would discuss with
northern and southern leaders.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of a ceasefire could be handed to "a joint Yemeni
committee with the help of foreign observers."
</P>
<P>
Four ceasefires have been announced by the government of President Ali
Abdallah Saleh in Sanaa since June 6 but none have held, with both
sides blaming each other for renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
Southern leaders have repeatedly called for international observers in
Yemen, which Sanaa has refused.
</P>
<P>
For its part Sanaa proposed on June 10 that a joint military committee
of north and south -- formed before war erupted on May 5 -- should
oversee a ceasefire. Southern leaders turned down the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said his plan offered a "common platform" for north and south
to halt fighting.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic (YDR), declared by the south
on May 21, repeated its call Tuesday for international observers --
but said it would accept northern Yemeni observers as part of the
team.
</P>
<P>
The YDR's appointed foreign minister, Abdallah Al-Asnaj, said in Abu
Dhabi that the south had asked the United Nations to send "between 100
and 150 officers" to oversee a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Rahman al-Jiffri, the south's vice president, said Aden would
not object to north Yemeni observers as part of the international
team, in an interview with the Abu Dhabi newspaper Al-Ittihad.
</P>
<P>
Jiffri also told an official Aden newspaper that the YDR would be
willing to maintain links or "special relations" with Sanaa, despite
the secession.
</P>
<P>
He added however on a defiant note: "Ali Abdallah Saleh is incapable
of breaking through to Aden."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Brahimi met Tuesday with UEA President Zayed ibn Sultan al-
Nahayan, one of the principal Arab mediators in the Yemen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi outlined the results of his meetings with the warring sides in
Yemen, WAM reported. He met Saleh in Sanaa on Thursday, and the
president's southern rival Ali Salem al-Baid in the eastern port of
Mukalla on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UN envoy was expected to travel on to Qatar before visiting
Jordan. Northern authorities believe he may also return to Sanaa to
meet Saleh a second time.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Baid, the envoy gave northern leaders a "list of
questions and points concerning guarantees demanded by the south for
the start of talks," a senior northern official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
A working group led by Saleh was due to meet Tuesday to respond to the
questions, the official said, including the south's demand for
international observers.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, the International Organisation of Migration said an
evacuation from Aden of more than 800 foreigners, mostly Arabs, was
expected to start by ship on Wednesday.
