Russia expected to impose peace settlement in Abkhazia by Boris Bachoz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia will soon get its chance to impose a peace settlement in
Georgia when it deploys up to 2,500 soldiers to separate Georgian
forces from those of the breakaway autonomous republic of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday approved an initial troop
deplopyment in Georgia, a former Soviet republic, over the objections
of the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
Three battalions -- about 1,200 soldiers -- are to deploy over the
next six days along the Inguri River, which divides Abkhazia from the
rest of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev on June 21 will seek the opinion of the
Federation Council. With backing from the body, additional troops will
be assigned, possibly bringing the total to 2,500 in a 48-kilometer
(30-mile) buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Russia already has around 20,000 troops in Tajikistan, where a pro-
Moscow government is under attack from Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
It has also assigned 1,800 men to take up positions between Romanian-
speaking Moldova and the separatist Russian-speaking republic of
Dniestr.
</P>
<P>
Russia is in addition hoping to station peacekeepers in Armenian-
dominated Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave seeking to break away from
Moslem Azerbaijan, another former Soviet republic. But Azerbaijani
authorities have so far resisted such a move.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, located in northwestern Georgia, broke from the republic in
August 1992, sparking a conflict with regular Georgian forces that has
left more 3,000 people dead. Georgia finally lost Abkhazia to rebel
forces in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
General Georgi Kondratiev, deputy defense minister, said Russian
troops in Abkhazia will operate in conjunction with 22 United Nations
observers.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of the UN mission, Jarl Lundgren of Sweden, the
question of how much control the United Nations will exert over the
Russian troops remains "under discussion."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had appeared reluctant to send a multinational
peacekeeping force to Georgia, largely for financial reasons, and has
tacitly agreed to leave the job to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth of Indepedent States (CIS), which groups former
Soviet republics, will have a symbolic role in the operation, as
observers from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus are expected to take
part.
</P>
<P>
But many Georgians, who suspect Russia of having armed and supported
the Abkhaz separatists, would have preferred UN troops to serve as
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the presence of Russian forces is not the only concession
that Georgian President Edouard Chevardnadze has had to make. He has
already in effect agreed to a measure of Russian involvement in
Georgian affairs, notably in joining the CIS in October 1993 and later
siging a wide-ranging cooperation accord with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He was finally obliged to accept a buffer force between Georgia and
Abkhazia to avoid giving the impression that he has acknowledged the
division of the country.
