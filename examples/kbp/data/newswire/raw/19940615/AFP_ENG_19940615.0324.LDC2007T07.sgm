UN envoy meets Saleh, government officials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi held "constructive" talks here late
Wednesday with Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh and senior
government officials aimed at ending Yemen's civil war, a UN spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Nejib Friji told reporters Brahimi later left Sanaa for Qatar, and he
would travel to Saudi Arabia Thursday for a meeting with Saudi Foreign
Minister Prince Saud al-Faysal.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is on a fact-finding mission aimed at brokering a ceasefire
and resumption of dialogue between the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
He met President Saleh privately for more than one hour, then held
talks with acting prime minister Mohammed al-Attar, Deputy Prime
Minister Abdelwahab al-Anisi, Planning Minister Abdelkarim al-Iryani
and Foreign Minister Mohammed Salem Bassandwa.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were constructive," Friji said.
</P>
<P>
In both meetings the UN envoy urged Sanaa leaders to abide by UN
Security Council resolution 924 of June 1, calling for an immediate
ceasefire in the war which broke out on May 5 and a resumption of
talks.
</P>
<P>
The official agency Saba reported that Saleh told Brahimi he was ready
to hold talks with southern leaders on "reactivating the joint
military commission" to oversee a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He proposed holding any such talks in Damascus, Riyadh, Cairo or Rabat
but insisted on they must be guided by principles to "preserve the
unity, democracy (..) and independence of a single Yemen."
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who arrived in Sanaa earlier in the evening, discussed a
military commission with the officials and "heard the Yemeni
government's viewpoint on it," Friji said.
</P>
<P>
On arrival in Sanaa, Brahimi said both sides had agreed on a military
commission to supervise a ceasefire, but differences remained.
</P>
<P>
The appointed vice president of the breakaway south Abderrahman Jiffri
earlier rejected the idea of reactivating the joint military
commission set up in December 1993, saying it had been appointed by
Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi would continue his contacts with "interested parties" in Saudi
Arabia and Egypt to "complete necessary elements in his report," due
to be submitted to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Friji
said.
