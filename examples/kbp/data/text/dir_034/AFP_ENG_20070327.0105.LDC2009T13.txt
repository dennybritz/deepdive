Turkish security forces on Tuesday found the bodies of seven
illegal immigrants who froze to death in the east of the country
after sneaking across the border from Iran, the Anatolia news
agency reported.


The bodies of the seven men were discovered in a mountainous area
in Van province, on the border with Iran, during a security sweep
targeting people smugglers, the agency said.


The nationalities of the victims were not immediately known.


Turkey is on a major human-smuggling route from Asia to Europe
and illegal immigrants are detained on an almost daily basis.
