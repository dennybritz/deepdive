Lithuanian Finance Minister Zigmantas Balcytis quit Tuesday after
his son, though later cleared, was involved in a court case over
a European Union funds scandal.


"I would like to announce that I handed my resignation to Prime
Minister Gediminas Kirkilas this morning", Balcytis said in
statement.


"I resign as I do not want to give any grounds for speculation
and interpretation related to my son, despite the fact that the
court decision was in his favour, as I always believed it would
be," Balcytis said.


A court in Vilnius on Monday cleared Donatas Balcytis of
accusations he was involved in the falsification of official
documents and of abusing his position, although the court
acknowledged he forged technical documents.
