Another US marine has been killed during fighting in Iraq, the US
military announced on Tuesday.


The marine died on Saturday on combat operations in the western
Al-Anbar province, it said. A raging Sunni Arab insurgency
fuelled by Al-Qaeda militants has proved deadly for US troops in
the province.


The latest death brought the military's losses in Iraq since the
March 2003 invasion to 3,235, according to Pentagon figures.
