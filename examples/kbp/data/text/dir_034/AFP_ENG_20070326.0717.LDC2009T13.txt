US technology start-up ZenZui launched on Tuesday, offering a
test version of software that lets people customize mobile
telephones with tile-shaped icons that link quickly to favored
websites.


Seattle-based ZenZui licensed the technology from software
colossus Microsoft, which has its headquarters in the neighboring
city of Redmond in Washington state.


ZenZui's "high-frame rate Zooming User Interface" enables people
to adorn screens of mobile devices with as many as 36 "tiles"
that can be clicked on to connect directly to chosen websites.


Tiles can be triggered by either using keypad buttons or touching
screens, depending on telephone models.


"ZenZui's compelling platform is already creating excitement
among carriers, content providers, interactive agencies and major
marketers," said ZenZui chief executive Eric Hertz.


The technology was created by Microsoft researchers and then
licensed to ZenZui as part of a Microsoft IP Ventures program
that gives entrepreneurs chances to go to market with inventions
it has no plans for.


Internet companies taking part in the ZenZui trial software
launch include Traffic.com, Razorfish, Kayak.com, and OTOlabs.


ZenZui is offering a unique mobile device platform "all wrapped
up in a gorgeous interface that's completely intuitive to use,"
said Bruce Woolsey, a vice president at marketing firm Advanced
Media Solutions.


"This kind of solution has been sorely missing from the mobile
marketing world," he added.


A video demonstration of ZenZui without narration but featuring a
music soundtrack was posted on social-networking website YouTube.
