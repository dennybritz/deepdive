A Japanese spy satellite has stopped working due to an electrical
problem, a report said Tuesday.


The radar satellite, which was put into orbit four years ago, had
not been operational since Sunday due to a problem related to its
battery system, said public network Japan Broadcasting
Corporation (NHK).


Japanese government officials declined immediate comment on the
report, which did not provide further details.


Japan has four spy satellites -- the last of which was launched
last month -- which together give Tokyo the ability to spy
anywhere on Earth at least once a day.


The satellites were launched as Japan tries to step up
information gathering on North Korea, which fired a missile over
Japan's main island in 1998 and tested an atom bomb last year.


But it faced an embarrassing failure in November 2003 when it had
to destroy a rocket carrying a spy satellite 10 minutes after
lift-off because a rocket booster failed to separate.


Japan has been expanding its space operations and has set a goal
of sending an astronaut to the moon by 2020.
