At least three Palestinians were killed on Tuesday in flooding
caused by the collapse of a sewage system in the northern Gaza
Strip, medics said.


The three people were killed and others, whose number was not
immediately clear, were reported missing when 25 buildings were
flooded in the Bedouin village of Um al-Nasr after the system
collapsed, they said.


Angry villagers opened fire on the convoy of Palestinian interior
minister Hani al-Qawasmeh who had come to inspect the damage,
witnesses said, but no further casualties were reported.
