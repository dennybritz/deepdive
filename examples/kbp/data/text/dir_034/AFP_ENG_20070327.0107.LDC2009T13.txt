Controversial changes to Egypt's constitution were approved by
75.9 percent of voters, according to official results of a
referendum announced on Tuesday.


The percentage of those who said yes in the referendum was 75.9
percent, the official MENA news agency quoted Justice Minister
Mamduh Marei as saying.


Information Minister Anas al-Fiqi said after polling closed on
Monday that turnout stood between 23 and 27 percent but
opposition and independent rights groups said it did not reach
the 10 percent mark.
