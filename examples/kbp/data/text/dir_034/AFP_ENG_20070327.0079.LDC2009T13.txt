A cane toad the size of a small dog has been captured in the
Australian tropical city of Darwin, the largest ever recorded in
the country's remote Northern Territory, environmentalists said
Tuesday.


Green group FrogWatch said the monster male was 20.5 centimetres
(8.1 inches long and weighed 861 grams (1.9 pounds).


"The biggest toads are usually females but this one was a rampant
male," said FrogWatch's Graeme Sawyer, who organises regular
excusions to trap and destroy the feral pests blamed for
destroying native Australian wildlife.


"He is huge. I would hate to meet his big sister."


The cane toad, whose scientific name is Bufo marinus, was
introduced from South America in the 1930s to control another
pest -- beetles that were ravaging the sugar cane fields of the
tropical northern coasts.


But the toads now number in the millions and are spreading
westward through the Northern Territory, upsetting the country's
ecosystem in their wake.


Cane toads have poisonous sacs on the back of their heads full of
a venom so powerful it can kill crocodiles, snakes or other
predators in minutes.


The animals, explosive breeders, have spread into the wetlands of
world heritage Kakadu National Park and have recently become
entrenched in Darwin.


All attempts to fight the spread of the toads so far have failed
and a history book last year rated their introduction as one of
the greatest mistakes ever made in Australia.
