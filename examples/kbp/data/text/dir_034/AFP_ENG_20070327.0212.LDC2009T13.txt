American Kate Ziegler swam a championship record to courageously
win the 1500-metres freestyle on a sensational fourth night of
the world swimming championships here Tuesday.


The defending champion was under world record pace up until 1000m
before winning in a new championship record of 15 minutes 53.05
seconds.


It took 7.13secs off German Hannah Stockbauer's previous best set
at the 2003 Barcelona world championships.


Ziegler's success capped a gold medal splurge by the Americans
following victories by Michael Phelps (200m freestyle) and
Natalie Coughlin (100m backstroke) in world record times.


Ziegler was looking for a chance to topple compatriot Janet
Evans' world record of 15:52.10 which has stood for 19 years,
before the gruelling effects took its toll.


"I felt really, really strong for the first thousand then I
started hurting real bad. It's the best time, I dropped two
seconds. I'm so excited," Ziegler said.


Swiss swimmer Flavia Rigamonti looked at one stage as if she may
take advantage and was within 1.2secs of Ziegler before the
American dug in to hold on for a 2.33sec victory.


Rigamonti's time of 15:55.38 was a new European record and she
was comfortably in front of third placed Ai Shibata (15:58.55) of
Japan.
