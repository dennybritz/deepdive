Business confidence in Germany bounced back in March, heading
back towards the 16-year high it had topped in December, as
concerns about negative effects of the rise in value-added or
sales tax evaporated, a survey showed Tuesday.


The widely watched business climate index, calculated each month
by the Munich- based economic research institute Ifo, rose to
107.7 points in March from 107.0 points in February, Ifo said in
a statement.


The rise took analysts by surprise: concensus forecasts had been
pencilling in a further decline this month after the index had
already fallen in January and February.


Those previous declines had been largely a result of concerns
about the possible negative effects of the three percentage-point
rise in VAT which came into effect at the beginning of the year.


But such concerns had now evaporated, Ifo president Hans-Werner
Sinn said.


The upturn in the eurozone's biggest economy was "strong and
robust," he insisted.


For its monthly survey, Ifo polls some 7,000 companies about
their assessment of current business and their expectations for
the next six months.


A breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-
index rose to 112.4 points in March from 111.6 points in
February.


And the expectations sub-index also increased, rising to 103.2
points from 102.6 points, Ifo said.
