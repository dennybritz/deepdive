UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was holding talks with Jordan's
King Abdullah II on Tuesday on the latest leg of his first Middle
East tour.


Ban and the Jordanian monarch will later fly separately to Saudi
Arabia for a two-day Arab summit opening on Wednesday that is
expected to revive an initiative for peace with Israel, officials
said.


He flew into Amman from Israel, where on Monday he suggested that
a possible meeting grouping Israel, some Arab states and the
international Middle East Quartet was a good option to jump-start
peace talks.


A four-way meeting is "a very interesting and useful idea to
consider, but we need more consultations," Ban said.


His visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in the
region that has seen US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
shuttle between Israeli and Palestinian leaders and hold talks in
Jordan to revive the peace process.


The Arab blueprint first floated in 2002 offers Israel full Arab
recognition in exchange for withdrawing from all occupied Arab
land, creation of a Palestinian state and return of refugees.
