Hong Kong share prices closed 0.30 percent lower Tuesday in
rangebound trade, with some blue chips under mild pressure as US
housing data sparked fresh concerns over the world's largest
economy, dealers said.


They said the recent uptrend in crude oil prices also prompted
investors to take a cautious stance.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 59.06 points at 19,706.79, off a
low of 19,661.86 and a high of 19,768.32. Turnover was 40.35
billion Hong Kong dollars (5.2 billion US).
