Japanese share prices closed down 0.90 percent on Tuesday as
investors locked in recent gains amid jitters over the US housing
sector and an upcoming raft of domestic economic data, dealers
said.


They said that the benchmark Nikkei index ended a five-day
winning streak after new home sales in the world's largest
economy hit a near seven-year low.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 156.91 points to 17,365.05.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section eased 17.51 points or 1.01 percent to 1,723.86.
