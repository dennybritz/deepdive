All Blacks veterans will play two matches in May against minnows
Japan, who are hoping to show their determination ahead of the
World Cup, organisers said Tuesday.


The 21-man Classic All Black squad -- featuring Jonah Lomu,
Carlos Spencer and Justin Marshall -- will face off with Japan on
May 9 and 12 in the western city of Kobe and Tokyo, the Japan
Rugby Football Union said.


Japan's coach John Kirwan, himself an All Blacks legend who
helped New Zealand win the inaugural World Cup in 1987, said the
games would provide practice for the World Cup in France.


"We need games like this to give us confidence," he said in a
statement, dismissing the idea that the matches would be a
cakewalk for his former teammates.


"They are going to go out and play like All Blacks. They won't
want to lose but neither do we," he said.


Japan have set themselves a daunting task of two wins in the
World Cup in France, although they have won just one of their 16
matches in the last five World Cups.


In a campaign spearheaded by rugby-loving former premier Yoshiro
Mori, Japan are also bidding to host the World Cup in 2015. Japan
lost to New Zealand for the rights to the 2011 tournament in a
bitter vote.


"We have to demonstrate to the world that we are serious about
being a world player," Kirwan said.


Japan made rugby history in 1995 when they were thrashed by New
Zealand 145-17 -- the largest-ever losing margin in a World Cup.
Their mark was broken in 2003 when Australia demolished Namibia
142-0.
