Japan on Tuesday deployed a handful of troops to Nepal to monitor
the country's ceasefire, the first military mission since
officially pacifist Tokyo created a full-fledged defence
ministry.


Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet decided at a meeting to
dispatch six soldiers to Nepal to observe arms control for a
year, a defence ministry official said.


They will help monitor weapons and soldiers under the peace
accord that ended the Himalayan kingdom's bloody decade-long
Maoist insurgency. Japan is a major donor to Nepal.


Japan, which was forced by the United States to renounce its
right to armed forces after World War II, has been slowly
expanding its military operations overseas.


In January, Japan created a full-fledged defence ministry for the
first time since 1945, upgrading the former Defence Agency which
was lower in rank than cabinet-level ministries.


With the change, Abe's conservative government also listed
overseas peacekeeping activities as a mission for Japan's
military, which are known as the Self- Defence Forces.


Previously, deployments abroad had been considered
"extraordinary," leading the government to seek parliamentary
approval.


"This is the first time we will deploy the Self-Defence Force
abroad since (peacekeeping) became one of the main missions for
the troops," Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma told reporters.


"We have to pay careful attention to their security," he said.


In Japan's most prominent deployment, it sent some 600 troops to
Iraq on a reconstruction mission. The soldiers returned last year
without suffering any casualties or firing a shot.
