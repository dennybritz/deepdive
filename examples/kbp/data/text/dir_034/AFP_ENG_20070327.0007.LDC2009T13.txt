Chinese share prices were 0.27 percent higher in Tuesday morning
trade with textile and infrastructure stocks gaining ground after
the previous session's record highs, dealers said.


They said that bouyant investor sentiment pushed the index into
positive territory amid confidence that a rosy corporate earnings
outlook will drive share prices even higher despite the ultimate
highs.


"The market saw some profit-taking after the key index recorded
gains over the past seven trading days, but the upbeat sentiment
has remained strong enough to push the indices back into positive
territory," said Jiang Fan, an analyst at Soochow Securities.


"The market is expected to retain its strength as more and more
companies are expected to report solid earnings growth in their
first-quarter results."


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
up 11.18 points at 3,133.99, after hitting a new all time high of
3,135.23.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 8.86 points or 0.27 percent to
3,290.30 and the Shenzhen A-share Index put on 6.40 points or
0.74 percent at 877.19.
