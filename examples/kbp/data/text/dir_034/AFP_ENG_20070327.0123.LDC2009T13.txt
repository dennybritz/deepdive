Nissan Motor Co. announced plans Tuesday to halve its domestic
sales workforce of 2,300 by 2010 as the Japanese automaker
restructures in its home market where it has suffered from poor
sales.


Nissan, which is preparing to report its first drop in annual
profits under its breakthrough foreign manager Carlos Ghosn, said
the revamp was designed to boost the performance of its
dealerships as the auto market evolves.


The automaker will initially reorganise its dealerships into 10
groups by geographic region.


"Subsequent to the establishment of the regional companies, we
are going to halve the number of people in the back office
operations, sales and marketing and subsidiary dealers," said
Nissan's chief operating officer Toshiyuki Shiga.


He said that the concentration of the back-office operations
would boost Nissan's cost competitiveness.


Nissan, which is 44 percent owned by France's Renault, warned
investors in February that net profits were expected to slide by
over 11 percent in the year to March 2007 due to poor sales,
particularly in its home market.


Shiga told reporters that domestic sales were expected to fall by
100,000 vehicles in the financial year ending this month, to
about 740,000 units.


He blamed the poor performance on the growing popularity of mini-
cars which have hit demand for traditional vehicles even as the
overall market shrinks.
