Police in northeastern Greece on Tuesday detained 41 would-be
migrants hidden on board a tanker truck near the border with
Turkey, a police source in the local town of Komotini said.


The group of men from Bangladesh, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Somalia were stowed in a special compartment and had each paid
2,000 euros (2,700 dollars) for passage to Athens, the source
said.


The tanker was intercepted on the highway between Komotini and
the northeastern port city of Alexandroupolis.


The Turkish driver of the vehicle and two Turkish passengers fled
into a neighbouring wood, and are being sought on suspicion of
people-smuggling.


Greece lies on a major people-smuggling transit route from Asia
to Western Europe, detaining scores of migrants on a monthly
basis both by land and sea.
