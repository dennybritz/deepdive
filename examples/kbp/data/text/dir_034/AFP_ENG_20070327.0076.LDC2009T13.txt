Nineteen Chinese nationals have been arrested in waters off
Malaysia's eastern Sabah state with an illegal catch of more than
70 protected turtles, most of them dead, reports said Tuesday.


Except for six turtles left alive, all of the rest of the
Greenback and Hawksbill turtles had been killed and preserved by
the Chinese fishermen from southern Hainan province, according to
reports.


Turtles are hunted in Malaysia for their meat and shell but also
die after getting entangled in fishing nets in the open seas.


China is a major importer of wild turtles from Asia for food and
medicinal purposes and aggressive illegal poaching in Southeast
Asian countries has seen wild turtle numbers falling.


The Star daily quoted district marine police chief Robert Salisip
as saying the 19 were caught Monday after a chase, 15 of them on
board a China-registered trawler, and another four in diving
suits on a smaller boat.


"The vessel sped away when the marine police boat approached. It
also tried to ram into the latter twice before it was forced to
stop 30 minutes later," another newspaper, the New Straits Times,
quoted him as saying.


Salisip said the trawler left Hainan March 15 and arrived in
Sabah waters four days later, adding that the men are being
investigated for encroachment and possession of a protected
species.
