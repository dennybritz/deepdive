Three teenagers in Poland were arrested after coming up with the
money-spinning idea of stealing a bus and selling it for scrap,
police said Tuesday.


The three 16-year-old boys took the vehicle from an out-of-town
shopping centre west of Warsaw, police spokesman Krzysztof
Lenarczyk was quoted as saying by the PAP news agency.


"They then drove it right to a scrap metal yard and sold it for
2,600 zlotys (673 euros, 894 dollars)," Lenarczyk said.


The three youngsters were detained and now face a juvenile court
hearing.


The scrap metal merchant was also arrested and will have to
answer charges of receiving stolen goods.
