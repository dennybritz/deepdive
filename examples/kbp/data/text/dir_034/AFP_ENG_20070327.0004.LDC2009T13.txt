Investors in a central China city are building a giant 300
million-dollar sculpture of a dragon that they say will be the
largest in the world, state media said on Tuesday.


The "Ancestral Dragon", whose partially completed head rises nine
metres (30 feet) above ground in Henan province, will be finished
by 2009 to mark the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic's
founding, the Beijing Morning Post said.


The investor group based in the nearby provincial capital of
Zhengzhou said the 21-kilometre (13-mile) metal structure is
intended as a tourist destination that will wind its way along a
circular group of hills north of the city.


It will house galleries in which visitors can, for a fee, have
their names and other messages inscribed. Advertising space on
the giant serpent also will be sold, the paper said.


An overseas Chinese investor group initially began the project in
2002 but abandoned it due to financial difficulties.


The new group are also having money troubles and seeking funds
from other parties, adding that the dragon could act as a barrier
protecting Zhengzhou from sandstorms that blow in from the north
each spring, the paper said.


The length of the dragon was selected to represent the 21st
century, the paper said.
