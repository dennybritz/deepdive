A suicide attacker dressed in police uniform blew himself up
outside a provincial police headquarters in southern Afghanistan
Tuesday, killing four policemen, an official said.


The bomber had been trying to enter the office of the police
chief in the town of Lashkar Gah, the main town in Helmand
province.


"While being searched at the entrance he detonated, killing four
police and wounding one," the police chief, Mohammand Nabi
Mullahkhail, told AFP.
