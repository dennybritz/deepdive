Japanese police Tuesday found the body of a young British woman
buried in sand in a bathtub, officials said.


The 22-year-old, who worked in Japan as an English-language
teacher, failed to report to work Sunday, leading her school to
call a search to find her.


Police found her body covered in sand in a disconnected bath on
the balcony of an apartment in suburban Tokyo, a police spokesman
said.


Jiji Press said one of her hands was sticking out of the sand.


The British embassy confirmed the body was of the missing woman,
whose name is not being released until relatives are informed.


"The police are investigating. The ambassador has been to liaise
with the chief of police," an embassy spokesman said.


Police refused to speculate on the cause of death but said they
were trying to find a man who lived in the flat and was a friend
of the woman.


The case comes seven years after the disappearance of another
young British woman, Lucie Blackman. The 21-year-old bar hostess
was found seven months later dismembered and buried in a seaside
cave.


The Blackman case made headlines in Britain and Japan, with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair personally calling for
cooperation on the investigation during a visit to Japan.


Police arrested a former property developer, Joji Obara, in
relation to Blackman's death. He is expected to be sentenced next
month.


Obara, who has pleaded not guilty, is charged with abduction,
assaults resulting in death, mutilation and abandonment of a
corpse, but not actual murder. He faces life imprisonment.
