The New York Stock Exchange has acquired the pan-European stock
market Euronext, winning 91.42 percent approval of its agreed bid
worth about 10.7 billion euros (14.26 billion dollars),
provisional results of a shareholder vote showed on Tuesday.


The outcome, creating the first inter-continental stock exchange,
was expected.


The vote also gave the NYSE 92.22 percent of the voting rights in
Euronext which groups stock markets in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam
and Lisbon and also the Liffe financial futures market in London.


At the end of December, shareholders in the two companies had
given almost unanimous approval for the tie-up. The main offer
was based on the exchange of one Euronext share for 0.98 shares
in NYSE Euronext and 21.32 euros in cash.


The two markets welcomed the success of the recommended bid which
results in a new company called "NYSE Euronext".


Trading in shares in the new entity is due to begin on April 4 in
Paris and New York.


The two groups said that the offer would be extended for a
maximum of 10 trading sessions after the final results are
announced on Friday.


The intention of this is for NYSE to obtain at least 95-percent
approval from Euronext shareholders, the level neeeded for
Euronext to be withdrawn from stock market listings.
