A lack of competitive games cost ultimately cost Sydney FC a
berth in the knockout stage of the AFC Champions League, coach
Branko Culina believes.


Sydney have impressed so far against Shanghai Shenhua and Japan's
Urawa Reds, claiming a hard-fought win and a draw, but have twice
run out of steam in the second half.


Culina said while other Asian teams were in peak condition as
they begin their domestic seasons, a lack of match practice for
his side could force their elimination from the competition.


"There's not a great deal we can actually do because it's not
fitness itself we need, it's match fitness and getting games,"
Culina said.


"There's a big disadvantage being in the situation we are in not
having opposition every week, which our (Champions League)
opponents do."


Sydney have not played a competitive domestic game since February
2 with the Australian season finishing last month.


They are currently in second place in their group behind Urawa
and play their next game on April 11 against Indonesia's Persik
Kediri.


It is the first year Australian clubs have taken part in the
competition.
