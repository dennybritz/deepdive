Denmark's Prince Christian, the 18-month old son of Crown Prince
Frederik and Australian-born Princess Mary, was enrolled Tuesday
in a municipal daycare in a first for the Danish royal family.


Christian, who is second in line to the throne, is the first
future regent to attend daycare. At his age, Crown Prince
Frederik had a nanny at the palace.


The toddler arrived Tuesday at the Dronning Louise Boernhus
daycare, located in Fredensborg north of Copenhagen, accompanied
by his parents, as well as dozens of photographers.


Mary Donaldson, 35, who is expecting the couple's second child,
married Prince Frederik, 38, in May 2004. Frederik is the eldest
son of Queen Margrethe II.


The couple live in an annex of the Fredensborg palace, the
queen's summer residence.
