The insurer Swiss Life said on Tuesday its net profit rose 9.0
percent in 2006 to 954 million Swiss francs (589 million euros,
785 million dollars), driven chiefly by a strong rise in
operating profit.


The results were above analysts' expectations, though the growth
rate was slower than the 44 percent recorded the previous year.


Profit from operations was up 23 percent at 1.26 billion Swiss
francs.


"The very good results reflect a systemic focus on profitable
growth, further increases in efficiency and the good risk
experience," said group CEO Rolf Doerig in a statement.


Gross premium revenue also rose 9.0 percent over the year to 22.1
billion Swiss francs.


The company's board will propose a 40 percent increase in the
annual dividend paid out to shareholders at Swiss Life's annual
general meeting on May 8, to seven Swiss francs per share from
five Swiss francs.


The company reaffirmed its target of achieving a profit of 1
billion Swiss francs by 2008.
