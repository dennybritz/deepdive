European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson urged on
Tuesday rapid completion of Russia's long-delayed entry to the
World Trade Organisation.


In Moscow for talks on the issue, Mandelson called for compromise
on all sides to seal membership for Russia, the only major
economy that is outside the global trade body.


"We're all losing out, including Russia, from delaying its
entry.... It requires a final effort on everyone's part,
including that of the Russian government. Their commitment is
strong but now flexibility must meet flexibility," he said.


"We could and should put this to bed by the end of 2007 and I
will be disappointed if it isn't."    Last November Russia made a
breakthrough in its long-delayed membership bid when it signed a
bilateral deal with the United States.


But Russia still needs to agree several other bilateral deals as
well as a multilateral agreement with the 150-member trade body.


Mandelson said lack of Russian membership hindered the "strategic
relationship" between Russia and the 27-member EU.


The EU is Russia's biggest trade partner, receiving more than
half of Russian exports, much of them in the form of oil and gas.


Mandelson said "a grand bargain on energy" was being held back by
a dispute over Polish meat imports to Russia and continued
negotiations over WTO accession.


In a speech to business leaders, Mandelson said Russia needed WTO
membership to reduce a risky dependence on oil and gas.


"There is an inherent risk if 40 percent of GDP growth is tied to
a mineral resource with a volatile international price. Eighty-
two percent of Russia's exports are related to hydrocarbons and
metals," he said.
