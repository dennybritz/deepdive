China called on the developed world Tuesday to show more
understanding for the pressure developing countries are under as
they seek to improve protection of intellectual property rights.


Chen Zhili, a ranking member of China's cabinet, told an
intellectual property forum in Beijing that developed countries
should appreciate the difficulties the developing world is
facing.


"As most of the key technologies are controlled by the developed
countries, the development of developing countries is indeed
under unprecedented pressure," she said.


"Therefore, developed countries should ... be more understanding
of the pressure on developing countries."


She urged developed countries to "pay more attention to the
interests of countries at different developing stages, and
promote the progress and distribution of science and technology."


The two-day Global Forum on IPR Protection and Innovation, co-
hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce and the China Council for
the Promotion of International Trade, began Tuesday.


It brings together more than 500 business leaders and officials
from countries and areas including Europe, Japan, Korea, the
United States, Singapore, India and China.
