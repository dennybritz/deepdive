Beijing Olympic organisers unveiled a unique medal design for the
2008 Olympics here Tuesday as part of festivities marking the
500-day countdown to the showcase event.


A band of Chinese jade stands out as a distinctive feature
embedded on the back of each medal, whether gold, silver or
bronze, organisers said at the unveiling ceremony carried live on
state television.


Adding another Chinese touch, interlocking dragons form the loop
for the medal ribbon.


The emblem of the Beijing Games -- a solitary dancing figure --
is engraved in the metal centrepiece of the back of each medal,
positioned above the Beijing 2008 logo and the five Olympic
rings.


The face of the medal follows the traditional Olympic design
depicting the winged goddesses of victory, Nike and Panathinaikos
Arena, engraved on all Olympic medals.


The Beijing Olympic Games medals "symbolise nobility and virtue"
and embody traditional Chinese values of ethics and honour,
organising committee vice president Jiang Xiaoyu said in a speech
at the unveiling ceremony.


"The medals embody Chinese style and elegance and are a
harmonious combination of Chinese culture and Olympism," said
Jiang.


A competition to select a medal design for the August 8-24
Beijing Olympics attracted more than 260 entries when it was
launched in January last year, organisers said.


A design from the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing
won the contest.
