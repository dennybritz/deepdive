A French appeals court on Tuesday overturned a conviction handed
down on the state rail company SNCF for its role in the
deportation of two Jewish men in World War II.


The administrative court of appeal in the southwestern city of
Bordeaux decided that the case was outside its jurisdiction.


SNCF's conviction last June by an administrative court in
Toulouse was seen as a landmark ruling, and triggered some 1,800
similar requests for compensation.


The case centred on a suit brought by the family of Green party
deputy Alain Lipietz, whose father and uncle were taken by train
to an internment camp in Paris in May 1944. They both survived
the war.


SNCF was ordered to pay 62,000 euros (83,000 dollars), but lodged
an appeal.


Previous attempts to condemn the SNCF in criminal and civil
courts having failed, the case rested on claims that the French
state authorities, the police and the SNCF neglected their duty
to provide services to citizens.


Administrative courts in France judge suits brought against the
state.


But the appeal court said Tuesday that SNCF is a legal entity in
its own right, and therefore subject to the normal justice
system.
