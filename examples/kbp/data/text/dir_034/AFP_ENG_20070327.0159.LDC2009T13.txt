Finance Minister Avraham Hirshson was being questioned for a
second time on Tuesday as part of a probe into corruption in a
labour union that he formerly headed, Israeli police said.


"He arrived at the unit for financial investigations at 9 am
(0700 GMT) and is being questioned by police officers," spokesman
Micky Rosenfeld told AFP.


A week earlier, police investigators grilled Hirshson for seven
hours over suspicions of involvement in aggravated robbery and
fraud, embezzlement, obstruction of justice and conspiring to
commit a crime.


Hirshson has denied the charges.


In January, police confirmed media reports that a graft probe had
been launched against Hirshson, the latest in a string of Israeli
officials to face corruption charges.


The allegations are part of an investigation into embezzlement of
13.5 million dollars from the Histadrut labour federation which
Hirshson once headed.


Corruption probes and other scandals involving senior Israeli
officials have rocked the Jewish state during the past six
months.


Among them have been several graft probes against Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert and a looming rape indictment against President Moshe
Katsav, who has since taken a leave of absence from the largely
ceremonial post.
