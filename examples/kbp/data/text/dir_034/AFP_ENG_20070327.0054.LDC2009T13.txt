Sudan's two main governing parties have renewed their commitment
to peace and vowed never to resume the north-south war that
plagued Africa's largest country for two decades.


President Omar al-Beshir's National Congress and First Vice
President Salva Kiir's Sudan People's Liberation Movement made
the pledge late Monday after a three-day meeting of their
leaderships.


"Both parties pledge to implement the peace deal and never to
revert to war for whatever reason," said a joint statement.


Beshir's party and the former rebel SPLM signed a peace deal in
January 2005 ending a 21-year civil war that had left around 1.5
million people dead and four million displaced.


The former foes then joined forces in a national unity government
but tension has simmered since then as implementation of some
major points of the peace agreement has fallen behind schedule.
