Yahoo and MobiTV announced on Tuesday that the Internet search
titan will handle sales and delivery of video advertising for the
mobile television and music firm.


"MobiTV is the pioneer in mobile television and we are excited to
work with them to continue to grow the mobile advertising
marketplace," said Yahoo vice president Bruce Stewart.


Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo will deliver video
advertisements for MobiTV mobile television and premium
programming beginning later this year, the companies said.


"Clearly this alliance provides a broad spectrum of value," said
MobiTV vice president Jack Hallahan. "As we progress, we will
deploy additional features including next-generation
interactivity, location-awareness and click-to-act."


MobiTV has reportedly grown to more than a million subscribers
since the Emeryville, California, company was founded in 1999.
MobiTV provides services Britain, Canada and the United States.


"It's a privilege to collaborate with Yahoo, a pioneer in
behavioral targeting techniques, to deliver advertising which
will be targeted and contextually relevant to the mobile
environment," said MobiTV vice president Ray DeRenzo.
