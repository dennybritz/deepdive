The Pakistan cricket team were set to leave for home Tuesday
after a two-day stopover in London during which they have kept a
low profile amid the furore over the murder of their coach Bob
Woolmer.


Captain Inzamam ul-Haq and his team arrived in London on Sunday
and have been staying at a hotel near the capital's Heathrow
airport for a pre-arranged stopover en route home after their
doomed trip to the Caribbean.


The players, said to be devastated at Woolmer's death hours after
they were dumped out of the Cricket World Cup by minnows Ireland,
have made little or no comment during their London stay.


Their planned departure came as a British press report said
Jamaican police were searching for three of the Pakistan team's
fans who spent a great deal of time with the players, in order to
"eliminate them" from enquiries.


The three reportedly were close to the players and appeared with
them at press conferences and after matches. The paper said they
are believed to have left Jamaica shortly after Woolmer was found
dead on March 18.


The 58-year-old was found unconscious in his hotel room, and
declared dead hours later.


His mysterious murder came just one day after a stunning defeat
to debutants Ireland, stirring speculation that match-fixing
gangs may have been involved in the murder.


It was unclear exactly when the Pakistani team was due to head
home, but reports suggested they would take a flight in the
evening London time.
