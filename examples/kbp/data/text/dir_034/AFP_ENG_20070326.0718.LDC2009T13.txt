Hong Kong has a new dining guide with a difference -- one that
lists what seafood is environmentally sound to eat and which
should be avoided in the interests of conservation.


The booklet, which ranks the 60 most popular fish species eaten
here, was published Tuesday to help ease the strain this southern
Chinese territory's voracious appetite for seafood is placing on
the region's fish stocks.


The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), publishers of the guide,
said they hoped it would become a regular part of dining in Hong
Kong.


"Consumers have the power to make a big difference in protecting
globally depleted marine resources through their purchasing
decisions," WWF Hong Kong chairman Markus Shaw said.


The booklet classifies species according to how sustainably they
have been harvested or farmed.


Those with a green or "Recommended" code are caught in ways that
have the least impact on their numbers and the environment,
including Alaskan salmon and Western Australian rock lobster.


A red or "Avoid" code indicates species caught in ways that have
a negative impact on their numbers and include endangered fish
such as the humphead wrasse and South African abalone. A yellow
"Think Twice" code tells buyers to beware.


According to UN figures, Hong Kongers have a huge appetite for
seafood, with each of its seven million inhabitants eating an
average of 58 kilogrammes of fish and shellfish each year.


Growing worldwide demand for seafood has sparked concerns for the
survival of many species, including tuna and swordfish, which
have been fished close to extinction.
