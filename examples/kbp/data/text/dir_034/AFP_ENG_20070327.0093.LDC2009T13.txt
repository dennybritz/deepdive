Samsung Electronics, the world's top memory chipmaker, said
Tuesday it has developed the industry's first fusion
semiconductor that combines two different types of flash memory.


The Flex-OneNAND can help make handsets for mobile phones and
multimedia gadgets much more compact at cheaper prices, Samsung
officials said.


The product merges the two different NAND flash memory chips --
the SLC type which excels in processing data quickly and the MLC
type suitable for storing large amounts of data -- into a single
set, Samsung said in a statement.


"The ratio of SLC to MLC functions within the same device can be
freely adjusted in accordance with different product needs,"
spokeswoman Park Sunghae said.


Samsung said the fusion memory chip was unveiled at the Samsung
Mobile Solution Forum in Taiwan Tuesday.
