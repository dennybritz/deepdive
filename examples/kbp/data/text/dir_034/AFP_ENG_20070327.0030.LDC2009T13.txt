South Korea Tuesday was to begin shipping fertiliser aid to North
Korea after the communist state agreed at six-party talks to
dismantle its nuclear programme, officials said.


A Vietnam-registered ship carrying 6,500 tons of fertiliser was
due to leave the southern port of Yeosu on Tuesday evening, the
unification ministry said.


South Korea plans to complete the shipment of 300,000 tons of
fertiliser to its hungry and impoverished neighbour by the end of
June.


The South suspended its regular annual shipments of 500,000 tons
of rice and 300,000 tons of fertiliser after the North's missile
tests last July. Emergency aid for flood victims was halted at
the same time.


Relations were further chilled by the North's October nuclear
test but improved after it consented during multinational talks
in Beijing last month to shut down its nuclear plants.


Earlier this month the two Koreas resumed high-level bilateral
talks. The South agreed in principle to restart regular annual
rice aid and said fertiliser shipments would go ahead in time for
the spring planting.


Seoul also decided last week to resume humanitarian aid for flood
victims.


Deliveries of flood aid will begin Wednesday. North Korea will
receive 10,500 tons of rice, 70,415 tons of cement, 50 trucks,
60,000 blankets and 1,800 tons of iron bars.


North Korea suffered several years of famine which killed
hundreds of thousands of people starting in the mid-1990s, and
still faces persistent food shortages despite overseas aid.
