The chairman of Pakistan's national airline has resigned,
officials said Tuesday, following a European Union safety ban
imposed on most of its ageing fleet.


Tariq Kirmani, the chief of Pakistan International Airlines
(PIA), had also been under pressure due to the state-owned
carrier's mounting losses.


"Pakistan International Airlines chairman Tariq Kirmani has
resigned and so far there is no replacement," a PIA spokesman
told AFP.


The EU said earlier this month that it would allow only PIA's
eight Boeing 777 planes to fly to Europe. Its other 37 aircraft,
mainly older Boeing 747s and Airbus A310s, were put on the EU
blacklist due to safety concerns.


EU aviation sources said last month that experts had agreed that
PIA should be added to the 27-nation bloc's blacklist because of
its ageing fleet.


Kirmani earlier this month criticised the EU ban as
discriminatory and said that steps were being taken to bring
everything back to normal by March 28.


"The EU decision is unjust and discriminatory. PIA had a better
record than certain major European airlines presently flying in
the skies of the EU," Kirmani told a news conference on March 6.


"The whole episode was muddy and very discriminatory," he said.
