Militants fired rockets at a paramilitary fort in northwest
Pakistan Tuesday, as authorities shut nearby schools following a
deadly clash between Taliban recruiters and police.


Troops retaliated with gunfire after eight rockets were fired at
the Frontier Constabulary fort in the the northwestern town of
Tank early Tuesday, but the exchange of fire caused no
casualties, they said.


Local residents said loud blasts woke them up around 3:30 am
(2230 GMT).


The local government meanwhile closed all educational
institutions in the district for five days as a preventive
measure after fighting at a high school in Tank left a policeman
and an insurgent dead.


The school had asked for police protection after Taliban
militants visited several schools in the area in recent days to
recruit students to fight "jihad" or holy war agiainst NATO and
US forces in Afghanistan, residents said.


The leader of the militants hurled a hand grenade at policemen
when they tried to keep them out, killing the officer in charge
of the local police station.


"In view of the law and order situation, we have closed all
educational institutions for five days," district administration
official Syed Mohsin Shah told AFP.


Militants recently torched video shops and banned barbers from
shaving beards in northwestern Pakistan, fuelling concern about
the "Talibanisation" of the already conservative area.
