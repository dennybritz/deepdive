A British woman and her 10-year-old daughter were killed by a
rogue elephant while her husband escaped unhurt during a hunting
tour in southwestern Zimbabwe, state media reported Tuesday.


The state-controlled Herald quoted an unnamed parks and wildlife
authority official as saying Veronica Poker, 47, and her daughter
Shallot died on the spot when they were attacked by a lone
elephant during a guided tour in the Hwange game park on
Saturday.


It happened on Saturday mid-morning "when the three tourists who
were accompanied by a tour guide were watching a lone elephant
while they were hiding behind an anthill," the newspaper quoted
the official as saying.


"It is reported that the elephant could have seen the people and
started charging towards them."


He said wardens were deployed following the tragedy to track the
elephant believed to be wounded.


"Wounded elephants are those that are normally aggressive," the
official told the newspaper.


The official said the guide fired a shot to scare away the
elephant but it kept on charging towards the touring party and
trampled the guide who suffered a fractured pelvis bofore turning
on the tourists.


National police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena referred questions to
the police commander for the Matabeleland north province who
could not be reached for comment.
