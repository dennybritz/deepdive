Chinese share prices closed 0.51 percent higher Tuesday,
extending gains to a seventh day and yet another record finish in
trade led by second-line stocks, dealers said.


They said that bouyant investor sentiment pushed the market
further into positive territory amid confidence that a positive
corporate earnings outlook will drive share prices even higher.


Volumes continue very heavy.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, closed up 16.02 points at 3,138.83, a fresh closing
high, on turnover of 114.05 billion yuan (14.72 billion US
dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 16.90 points or 0.51 percent to
3,298.34 on turnover of 113.59 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index added 8.20 points or 0.94 percent at 878.99, also a
record, on turnover of 60.90 billion yuan.
