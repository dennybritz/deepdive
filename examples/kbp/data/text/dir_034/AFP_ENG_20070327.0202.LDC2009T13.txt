Garuda Indonesia has bought 35 new jets from Boeing which will
start arriving from 2009, the flag carrier's spokesman Pujo Broto
said Tuesday.


"This involves a package of 25 Boeing 737-800 Next Generation and
10 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners," Broto told AFP.


A Garuda Indonesia jet crash-landed March 7 in the central city
of Yogyakarta and erupted in flames, killing 21 people and
highlighting Indonesia's blighted transport safety record.


Broto said the deal was struck long before the crash. He declined
to specify a value for the aircraft order but said an initial 23
million dollars had been paid.


The Next Generation aircraft are to be used for domestic travel
and are due by late 2009. The Dreamliners, expected from 2011,
are earmarked for long-haul international routes.


A string of deadly transport disasters has shaken confidence in
the air and sea links that bind Indonesia, an archipelago nation
of 17,000 islands.


The government said last week that none of Indonesia's domestic
airlines offered high safety levels and is trying to boost
passenger protection.


Experts have blamed recent accidents on lax safety standards, old
planes and ferries and insufficient investment in infrastructure
despite booming passenger numbers.
