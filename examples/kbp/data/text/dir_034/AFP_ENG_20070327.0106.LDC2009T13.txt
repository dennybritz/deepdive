Iran's central bank governor Ebrahim Sheibany Tuesday described
fresh sanctions imposed by the United Nations as only "symbolic"
and said they would not affect the country's economy.


"It has no effect because it is not related to our economy,"
Sheibany told AFP on the sidelines of an Islamic finance forum
here.


"That refers only to some symbolic things like, for example, they
are putting some sanctions over arms to other countries," he
said.


The United Nations Security Council on Saturday imposed new
economic and trade sanctions on Iran after the country ignored
repeated ultimatums to suspend uranium enrichment.


The UN resolution blocks all Iranian arms exports and freezes the
overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions
linked to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.


It also restricts financial aid or loans to Tehran and sets a
fresh 60-day deadline for Iran to comply with UN demands or face
"further appropriate measures."


"We are not a main producer nor exporter of arms to other
countries so I can say it has not really an adverse effect on our
economy," said Sheibany.
