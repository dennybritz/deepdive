Switzerland has lifted seasonal restrictions on keeping live
poultry outdoors, which were aimed at preventing the spread of
bird flu, earlier than scheduled, veterinary officials said on
Tuesday.


No cases of bird flu have been diagnosed in either wild or
domestic birds this winter, Federal Veterinary Office (OFV)
spokeswoman Catherine Maret told AFP.


The mild winter across all of Europe has meant migratory birds
have already started their journeys back to the Far North, thus
reducing the risk of them coming into contact with domestic
poultry, the OFV said.


Swiss authorities last October imposed a ban on raising poultry
outdoors within a one-kilometre (half-mile) radius of the
country's main lakes and rivers, to run from October 15 to April
30.


Between February and March 2006, some 32 cases of bird flu were
diagnosed in wild birds found on Swiss territory; one by Lake
Geneva and the rest by Lake Constance in the northeast of the
country.
