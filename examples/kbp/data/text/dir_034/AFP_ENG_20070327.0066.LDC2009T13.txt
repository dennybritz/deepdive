Europe's major stock markets rose in opening deals on Tuesday,
with gains of around half a percent for the Frankfurt and Paris
indices.


Frankfurt's DAX 30 increased by 0.41 percent to 6,857.15 points
and in Paris the CAC 40 index won 0.63 percent to 5,611.34
points.


London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares managed a climb of just
0.01 percent to 6,292.40 points.


European shares had lost ground on Monday, with major markets hit
by poor US housing data. Paris and Frankfurt ended more than one
percent lower.
