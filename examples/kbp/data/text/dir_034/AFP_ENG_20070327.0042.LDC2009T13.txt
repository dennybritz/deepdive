Air Berlin, Germany's second-biggest airline, said Tuesday it had
agreed to acquire charter airline LTU for 140 million euros (186
million dollars).


In addition, Air Berlin would assume 190-200 million euros of
LTU's debt, the carrier said in a statement.


The transaction, which has yet to be approved by the competition
authorities, would be financed through the issuance of new shares
and convertible bonds to the tune of 250 million euros, Air
Berlin said.


LTU would remain a legally independent company within the Air
Berlin group and the LTU brand would be retained "in the
foreseeable future," the statement added.
