British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett Tuesday called on Iran
to quickly release 15 detained sailors and allow British
diplomats access to them.


"First ... we continue to call for not just their safe but speedy
return and second we continue to seek consular access to them for
our diplomats," Beckett told a news conference here after talks
with his Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
