Japan's former skating chief was convicted Tuesday but allowed to
walk free for embezzling money from the popular sport's governing
body.


The conviction caps a rapid rise and fall for Katsuichiro
Hisanaga, who once wielded significant influence in the sport and
formerly served as vice president of the Switzerland-based
International Skating Union.


The Tokyo District Court sentenced Hisanaga to three years
suspended for misusing funds of the Japan Skating Federation,
which he used to head, a court spokesman said.


Hisanaga admitted the allegations, which frequently leads to
suspended sentences in Japan's legal system.


Hisanaga was convicted of inflating costs of the 2002 World
Figure Skating Championships so he could hand 5.8 million yen
(50,000 dollars) to a travel agency which gave him kickbacks.


Along with Hisanaga, the federation's former director Mitsuo
Matsumoto was sentenced to two years suspended.


Hisanaga stepped down as head of the Japan Skating Federation in
2004 after six years in office.


Figure skating is one of the most popular sports in Japan, which
last week hosted the latest world championships.
