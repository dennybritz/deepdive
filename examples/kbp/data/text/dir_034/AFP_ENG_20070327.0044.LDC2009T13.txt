Thailand will host the Asian Tennis Federation's inaugural Asian
Masters Cup later this year, bringing together the continent's
top seven male and female players, organisers said Tuesday.


With 200,000 dollars in prize money, the tournament will take
place November 26 to December 2 in Bangkok, said Major General
Phitsanu Arthakornsiripho, deputy secretary of the Lawn Tennis
Association of Thailand.


The top seven Asian male and female players will be automatically
recruited for the tournament. The host country will also recieve
a wildcard in each category, he said.


The tournament will take place every year, with a different host
country each time.


"Asian and Thai tennis will improve its development by having
more tournaments," Phitsanu said.


Organisers are still deciding on the format for the tournament,
he said.


Among the players who will be recruited for the tournament are
South Korea's Lee Hyung-Taik, Asia's top player and currently
ranked 48th in the world. Other top players include Thailand's
Danai Udomchoke and Paradorn Srichaphan.


On the women's side, players will include China's Li Na and
Japan's Ai Sugiyama.
