Thousands more chickens have been slaughtered in Bangladesh after
the country confirmed its first outbreak of bird flu last week,
officials said Wednesday.


Nearly 4,000 chickens were killed at farms in the northern
Jamalpur district on Monday.


"We culled 3,777 chickens on two farms in Jamalpur district," a
livestock ministry official, who asked not to be named, told AFP.


"We also have reports that chickens in (central) Narayanganj
district have been affected and we will take the necessary action
there," he added.


Bird flu was first confirmed in Bangladesh last Thursday after
samples from one farm near the capital tested positive for the
deadly H5N1 strain of the virus. Some 40,000 birds at six farms
were slaughtered there.


The H5N1 virus has killed at least 169 people since late 2003,
most of them in Asia, according to the World Health Organisation.


Bangladesh is home to hundreds of thousands of poultry farms
which employ more than a million people.
