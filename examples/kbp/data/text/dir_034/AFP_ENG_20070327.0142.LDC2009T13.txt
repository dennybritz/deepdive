The operators of an Australian medical hotline on Tuesday said
hundreds of patients had reported bizarre reactions to a popular
sleeping pill, including binge-eating and stabbing themselves.


The federal government's Adverse Medical Events Line said it had
received more than 400 calls from people alarmed at their
reaction to the prescription sleeping pill Stilnox, also known as
Ambien.


One patient reported gaining 20 kilograms (45 pounds) after going
on eating binges since taking the medication, while others woke
to find they had been driving, cooking, painting or smoking in
their sleep.


One female patient reportedly had to have her leg amputated after
falling over after taking the drug, and another user told the
hotline he unwittingly drank half a bottle of whiskey and then
plunged off a balcony.


"We've had an unprecedented number of calls," said Geraldine
Moses, a pharmacist with the hotline.


Australia's medication regulator, the Theraputic Goods
Administration, said it was having discussions with sedative
manufacturers about adding stronger warnings to sleeping pill
packets.


The US Federal Drug Administration said earlier this month that
it was also examining the possibility of stronger warnings on
sedative packaging.
