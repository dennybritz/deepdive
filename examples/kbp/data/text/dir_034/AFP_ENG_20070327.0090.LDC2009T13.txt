German-US auto giant DaimlerChrysler is expecting JP Morgan,
which it has asked to look into the possible sale of its troubled
US unit Chrysler, to draw up a list of preliminary bids this
week, the business daily Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday.


The first round of the bidding would then be followed by a second
one, in which binding offers would be made, meaning that the sale
of Chrysler could drag on until June, the newspaper said, quoting
industry sources.


Nevertheless, some observers are calling for a more rapid sale,
it added.


A DaimlerChrysler spokesman refused to comment.


Previous reports have suggested that investment funds such as
Cerberus Capital, Blackstone and Centerbridge Partners have
expressed an interest.
