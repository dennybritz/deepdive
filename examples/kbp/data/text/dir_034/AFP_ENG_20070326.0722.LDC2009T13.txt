Hong Kong share prices finished the Tuesday morning session 0.16
percent weaker on mild profit-taking in blue chips as weak new
home sales data in the US weighed on sentiment, dealers said.


They said the recent uptrend in crude oil prices also prompted
investors to take a cautious stance.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning down 32.0 points at
19,733.85, off a low of 19,681.67 and a high of 19,768.32.
