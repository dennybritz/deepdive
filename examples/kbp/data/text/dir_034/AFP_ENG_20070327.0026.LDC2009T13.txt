Five Palestinians were wounded in overnight gunfights between
supporters of the rival Hamas and Fatah parties in the southern
Gaza Strip city of Rafah, security sources said on Tuesday.


It marked the latest flareup of factional violence since the
formation of a Palestinian unity cabinet aimed at halting
fighting that has killed dozens of Palestinians since mid-
December.

The clashes had largely ceased in Gaza after the two rivals
struck a deal to form the government at a summit in February,
although there have been occasional flare-ups, sometimes as a
result of clan disputes.
