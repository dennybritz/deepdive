Josef Ackermann, the head of Germany's biggest bank Deutsche
Bank, was once again the highest-paid company executive last
year, taking home a total 13.2 million euros (17.6 million
dollars) as his bank turned in record profits, figures showed on
Tuesday.


Swiss-born Ackermann earned a basic salary of just 1.15 million
euros last year, but pocketed 8.1 million euros in performance-
related bonuses and a further 3.8 million euros in share option
schemes, Deutsche Bank revealed in its 2006 annual report.


His salary was equivalent to 36,200 euros a day.


Last year was a record year for Deutsche Bank, with the bank
running up a net profit of nearly six billion euros.


But the bank came under fire for slashing thousands of jobs
nevertheless and Ackermann himself also stood accused of breach
of fiduciary duty in the landmark Mannesmann trial.


Ackermann was finally allowed to walk free in return for a
financial settlement of 3.2 million euros, which he was obliged
to pay out of his own pocket.


Ackermann had already been the highest-paid chief executive in
Germany in 2005 when he took home 11.9 million euros.


This year, he was followed by Linde CEO Wolfgang Reitzle, who
earned 7.4 million euros and DaimlerChrysler chief Dieter
Zetsche, who pocketed 7.2 million euros.


In all, Deutsche Bank management board members earned a total 33
million euros last year, the annual report revealed.
