British oil firm Cairn Energy said Tuesday that it made a net
loss of 82 million dollars (61.5 million euros) in 2006 after
downgrading the energy reserves estimates at its Sangu field in
Bangladesh.


The loss compared with profit of 79 million dollars in 2005,
Cairn Energy said in its earnings statement.


"The group made a loss after tax of 82.0 million dollars, mainly
due to the exceptional oil and gas write down of 71.5 million
dollars as a result of the downward reserves revision on Sangu,"
it added.


The Edinburgh-based company began 2007 by listing its Indian
unit, Cairn India, on the Mumbai stock exchange.
