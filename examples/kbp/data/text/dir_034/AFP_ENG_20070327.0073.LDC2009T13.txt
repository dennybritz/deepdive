Former Miss World Aishwarya Rai will marry her actor boyfriend
Abhishek Bachchan next month in one of the most high-profile
Indian weddings of the year, reports said Tuesday.


The ceremony will be held on April 20 at the Bachchan residence
in Mumbai, where the country's Hindi-language film industry is
based, the Times of India reported on its front page.


Calls to Rai's media manager and the Bachchan household for
comment went unanswered.


"The wedding will be a small, private affair with only close
family and friends in attendance, and it will be held at the
Bachchans' residence," the Press Trust of India quoted an unnamed
source as saying.


Rai, a leading Bollywood actress, and Bachchan, son of legendary
screen icon Amitabh Bachchan, got engaged on January 14, capping
months of media speculation about their relationship.


The couple have been dubbed "Abhiash," a melding of their two
names in the fashion of "Brangelina" for Brad Pitt and Angelina
Jolie.


Rai is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the
world and Bachchan, who is one of Bollywood's leading men, was
voted the sexiest Asian man by a British newspaper last year.


Both had been romantically linked to other Bollywood actors
earlier.


The expected low-key tone of the wedding will contrast with the
opulent marriage ceremony of British model Elizabeth Hurley and
her businessman husband Arun Nayar in India earlier this month.


Hurley and Nayar hosted a series of lavish parties in the lead-up
to the wedding at a former maharaja's palace in Jodhpur, which
sparked a media frenzy.
