Israeli and Palestinian leaders had agreed to meet every two
weeks and urged Arab nations to reach out to Israel.


"The Arab states must being reaching out to Israel... to show
Israel that they accept its place in the Middle East," she told a
press conference in Jerusalem as she wrapped up a regional tour
aimed at advancing Middle East peace efforts.


Rice also announced that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas have agreed to meet every two
weeks, but said it was not yet time for final status negotiations
which would tackle the thorniest issues dividing the two sides.


Olmert and Abbas "have agreed that they plan to meet together
biweekly," Rice said, but added: "We're not yet at the... (stage)
of final status" negotiations.
