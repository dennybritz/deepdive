The head of the US Central Intelligence Agency met Defence
Minister Kim Jang-Soo Tuesday during a previously unannounced
visit to South Korea, the ministry said.


A spokesman declined to say what was discussed in the meeting
between Kim and CIA director Michael Hayden, but Yonhap news
agency said North Korea's nuclear programme was the main topic.


Hayden arrived on Monday for a three-day visit as part of an
Asian tour, it quoted a source as saying. He also had talks with
Lieutenant-General Kim Eun-Ki, chief of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff's intelligence bureau, it said.


Hayden has also met Kim Man-bok, chief of the National
Intelligence Service, and other senior security officials to
share intelligence on North Korea's nuclear activities, according
to the source.


The North tested its first nuclear weapon last October.


Under a February 13 multinational agreement it should shut down
and seal its plutonium-producing Yongbyon reactor and other
plants by April 14 in exchange for energy aid.
