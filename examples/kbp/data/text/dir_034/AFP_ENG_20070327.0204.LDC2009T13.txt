Greece urged the European Central Bank on Tuesday to replace one
and two-euro coins with notes as a measure to curb inflation in
the eurozone.


"The European Central Bank should reconsider its position,
because there is common conviction that one and two-euro notes
are necessary for smooth market operations, and their circulation
can help combat price increases," Greek Development Minister
Dimitris Sioufas said in a statement.


Sioufas, who made a similar call in October 2005, said one and
two-euro notes are necessary to make people "appreciate the
currency's value".


"The best interests of European citizens are the ultimate
priority (here), not the operational expenses of the ECB, " the
minister said.


Greece decided to repeat its proposal after the European Union
issued a special euro coin this week to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the Treaty of Rome which founded the European
Economic Community, now known as the European Union.
