Two people in Indonesia died after testing positive for bird flu,
with further tests being conducted to confirm initial results,
the country's health ministry said Tuesday.


A 22-year-old female university student died on Saturday and a
teenage boy on Sunday in different parts of the country, the
ministry's Bird Flu Information Centre said.


The deaths, after further confirmation, would take Indonesia's
toll from the disease to 68, the highest in the world.
