Six Vietnamese workers on Tuesday filed a lawsuit seeking about
70 million yen (600,000 dollars) in damages from a subcontractor
of Toyota Motor Corp. over alleged unfair working conditions.


The six women in their 20s, who came to Japan under a training
programme sponsored by the Japanese government, filed the suit
with Nagoya District Court in central Japan, said one of their
supporters, Hiroshi Sugiura.


They worked for less than the minimum wage and had to pay a fine
of 15 yen (13 US cents) per minute every time they went to the
bathroom, said Sugiura.


The plaintiffs came to Japan in 2003 and 2004 and were making
seat parts for Toyota vehicles at subcontractor TMC, but "were
paid less than the floor wage designated by the government," he
told AFP.


"There was a fine for going to a bathroom and other stressful
working conditions," he added.


Officials of TMC were not immediately available for a comment,
while a Toyota Motor spokeswoman said the auto giant had no
information on the lawsuit.


The subcontractor also allegedly held the women's passports and
medical insurance cards and refused to pay overtime, the
plaintiffs say.


"When I made a mistake, they called me an animal ... not a human
being. Hearing such words of rebuke was tough,"  one of the
plaintiffs, Le Thi Kim Lien, 22, told a news conference Tuesday
after filing the suit.
