China on Tuesday offered no warm words to Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe after he apologised for Japan's forced sexual slavery
of Chinese and other women during World War II.


"We have already stated our position on that and I won't repeat
it here," foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said when asked for
China's reaction to Abe's apology, without further comment.


Seeking to tamp down an international uproar he caused by recent
remarks on the coercion of the so-called "comfort women", Abe
offered an apology on Monday.


"I am apologising now as the prime minister. This has been stated
in the Kono statement," Abe said in parliament.


He was referring to a landmark 1993 statement by then chief
government spokesman Yohei Kono apologising to former comfort
women and acknowledging Japan's involvement in causing their
suffering.


Historians say up to 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea but
also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan, were
forced to serve as sex slaves in Japanese army brothels.


The issue has repeatedly reared its head in recent years, most
recently when Abe said earlier this month there was no evidence
that Japan directly coerced comfort women.


Following Abe's initial comments, Chinese Foreign Minister Li
Zhaoxing called for Japan to face up to the facts.


"(The treatment of) comfort women is one of the serious crimes
committed by the Japanese militarists in World War II. This is a
historical fact," he said.


"The Japanese government should face up to this part of history,
take responsibility, seriously view and properly handle this
issue."
