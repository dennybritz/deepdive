This year's Southeast Asian Games in Thailand will have the
"strictest ever" anti-doping procedures with twice as many tests
as the last tournament, a Thai official said here Tuesday.


Up to 10 percent of athletes at the event in December are
expected to be screened, said Hilary Inwood, director of
Southeast Asia's Regional Anti-Doping Organisation (RADO).


"You are talking maybe 6,000 people coming to the SEA Games,"
Inwood said at a media briefing organised by the World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA), an independent international organisation
which fights doping in sport.


"So you are talking 600 samples," he said, adding it "will be the
strictest ever" doping screening carried out at the SEA Games.


With the formation of Southeast Asia's RADO, a concept initiated
by WADA, the region is able to pool its resources and work
together against drug cheats, said Inwood, who also represents
the Sports Authority of Thailand.


"In the past, we can't afford to do that within Southeast Asia
itself but  now that we have this organisation set up ... the
budget will come from each different country instead of relying
just on (the) host like we used to," he said.


"So we should have more budget. Therefore, we can test more now,"
he said.


RADO was established in May last year and is based in Thailand.


The other members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, East Timor and
Vietnam.
