Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao will discuss North Korea's
nuclear programme and other regional issues during a visit to
South Korea next month, the presidential office said.


During his April 10-11 visit, Wen and South Korean President Roh
Moo-Hyun will also discuss bilateral relations, and Wen will
attend the opening ceremony of Korea-China Friendship Year, it
said.


The event celebrates the 15th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations, which was a milestone for South Korea but a
major setback for China's ally communist North Korea.


China currently hosts disarmament talks also grouping the two
Koreas, the United States, Russia and Japan. In a February 13
agreement the North agreed to give up its nuclear weapons
programmes in exchange for economic aid and diplomatic benefits.


Wen will also visit Japan.
