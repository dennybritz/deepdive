Norway's Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg will Wednesday begin a
three-day state visit to Indonesia to boost trade ties and tour
reconstruction of tsunami-hit Aceh province, an official said.


The Norwegian premier will visit a reconstruction project funded
by his government, Dino Patti Djalal, a spokesman for the
Indonesian president, said in a statement Tuesday.


He will also meet Aceh's newly elected governor, former rebel
Irwandi Yusuf, who won an election last year that consolidated a
2005 peace accord between rebels and the Indonesian government.


Some 168,000 people were killed in Aceh by the December 2004
Indian Ocean tsunami.


Stoltenberg is to meet President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on
Thursday to witness the signing of an oil agreement, the
statement said.


They will also discuss bilateral relations and other issues,
including climate change.


On Friday, the Norwegian premier will go to Jakarta's Masjid
Istiqlal, the biggest mosque in Indonesia, and meet business
figures.


Stoltenberg's visit follows Yudhoyono's trip to Norway last year.
