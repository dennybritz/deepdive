British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Iran on Tuesday that the
standoff over the capture of 15 sailors would enter a "different
phase" if diplomatic efforts to secure their release failed.


Blair said all efforts were on securing their swift return
through diplomacy, but warned Britain cannot allow its service
personnel to be seized with "no justification whatever."


"What we are trying to do at the moment is to pursue this through
the diplomatic channels and make the Iranian government
understand these people have to be released," he told GMTV
television.


"I hope we manage to get them to realise they have to release
them. If not, then this will move into a different phase."
