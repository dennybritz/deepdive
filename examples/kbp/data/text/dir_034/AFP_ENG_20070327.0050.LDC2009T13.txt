Australian A-League club Perth Glory Tuesday announced a
sponsorship deal with a Chinese steel company that was said to be
one of the most lucrative in Australian football.


The club said Delong Holdings will become its joint major
sponsor, with a one- year deal worth 750,000 Australian (605,000
US) dollars.


The deal could also lead to games with Chinese Premier League
side Zhejiang Lucheng, which is owned by Chinese tycoon and
chairman of Delong, Liguo Ding, the club said in a statement.


"We have spoken about having matches each year in Perth and
Beijing between Perth Glory and his team," new Perth Glory owner
Tony Sage said.


"He believes that would attract around 50,000 people in the
Chinese capital to come along and see Glory play, which would be
a magnificent experience for our players and great preparation
during the pre-season."
