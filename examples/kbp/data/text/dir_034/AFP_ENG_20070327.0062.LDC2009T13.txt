Former Test opening batsman Justin Langer said Tuesday his desire
to lead Western Australia to a Sheffield Shield cricket title has
convinced him to extend his playing career.


Langer retired from Test cricket along with Shane Warne and Glenn
McGrath after the fifth Ashes Test against England in January and
there had been speculation about his playing future.


The 36-year-old left-hander has a stint in English county cricket
with Somerset to come, but on Tuesday he confirmed he would bat
on for his state team Western Australia in the next Australian
summer.


"When I stood here this time last year I had a burning desire to
win back the Ashes with my mates, and for a long time the
Australian cricket team have been my mates," Langer told
reporters in Perth Tuesday.


"I have felt in the last six months, I have started to develop
some really good friendships, some mates, with the West
Australian guys.


"And I have still got a burning ambition to win the Pura Cup
(Sheffield Shield) back, so there's your announcement."


The Western Australian Cricket Association has been talking with
former state player Tom Moody to be their next coach after
leading Sri Lanka in the World Cup.


"I'm still fit, I am still enjoying the game ... hopefully Tom
Moody will be coach, and if that is the case that would be an
added bonus," Langer said.


"I am sure if Tom wants the job he is a walk-up start... and we
are all hopeful we see him coming through the arrivals gate at
Perth airport in a month or so."
