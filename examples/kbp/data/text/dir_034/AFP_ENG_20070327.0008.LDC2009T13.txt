Japan's foreign minister said Tuesday that six-way talks on
denuclearising North Korea could resume next week after the
United States announced it had resolved a row over Pyongyang's
frozen funds.


"I think the six-way talks could resume next week as I heard that
transferring the funds will be complete in the next couple of
days," Taro Aso told reporters.


Once North Korea receives the money, a resumption in talks is
"extremely likely," Aso said.


The comments came hours after Christopher Hill, the chief US
envoy to the six- nation talks, said he expected the issue to be
resolved in a couple of days.


The six-nation talks broke down last week after North Korea
refused to enter negotiations until the money was safely
returned.


Pyongyang had stayed away from talks for more than a year, during
which it tested an atom bomb, after the United States blacklisted
a Macau bank accused of handling laundered and counterfeited
money for North Korea.


The United States announced an agreement on the funds at the
start of the latest round of talks last week.


But North Korea was angry after it failed to receive the 25
million dollars quickly at its account with the Bank of China,
which was reportedly concerned that handling the cash would hurt
its credit rating.
