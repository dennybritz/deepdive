A Japanese court on Tuesday refused to award compensation to
Chinese who were forced to work in a mine during World War II in
the latest rejection in a string of similar cases.


The Nagasaki District Court said the plaintiffs -- 10 former
forced labourers or their bereaved family members -- lost their
right to seek damages because the 20-year statute of limitations
had expired.


Plaintiffs sought 200 million yen (1.7 million dollars) in
damages from the Japanese government and then-employer Mitsubishi
Material Corp.


Judge Naoyuki Tagawa admitted that the Japanese government
decided and implemented the forced labour policy and that the
company was involved.


But "it is not the defendants' responsibility that plaintiffs
were unable to come to Japan to demand damages" within the
statute of limitations, he said.


Courts have rejected a slew of lawsuits by victims of Japanese
wartime aggression, which still haunts the country's relations
with other Asian nations.


On Monday, the Miyazaki District Court cited the same time limit
to reject a suit for 184 million yen in damages filed by another
set of former forced labourers.


The Japanese government argues that war reparations are a matter
between states rather than between states and individuals. China
gave up its right to compensation when it established diplomatic
relations with Japan in 1972.
