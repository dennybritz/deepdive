The Dallas Mavericks signed Kevin Willis on Thursday, making the
44-year-old centre the oldest player in the National Basketball
Association.


Looking for another big body for the postseason, the league-
leading Mavericks originally signed Willis to a 10-day contract
on April 2.


Willis has played under three minutes and failed to score since
signing.


A 20-year veteran, Willis had not played in the NBA since
appearing in 29 games for Atlanta in the 2004-05 season. He had a
reputation as one of the best- conditioned players in the league.


The only player older than Willis in NBA history was 46-year-old
Nat Hickey, who played one game for the Providence Steamrollers
in the 1947-48 season.  Hall of Fame center Robert Parish played
until he was 43.


Dallas lost third-string centre D.J. Mbenga to a season-ending
knee injury earlier this season. Mbenga played in last year's NBA
Finals, when the Mavericks matched up against monstrous Miami
center Shaquille O'Neal.


Joining his eighth team, Willis has career averages of 12.1
points and 8.4 rebounds in 1,421 games.
