Officials in the Solomon Islands declared the emergency phase of
their tsunami relief operation as complete Friday, and said their
focus was now switching to rehabilitation.


Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare also announced April 23 would be
a public holiday to remember the 40 people killed and 6,000 left
homeless by the quake and tsunami which smashed the improverished
archipelago April 2.


Sogavare said food was no longer a major issue as most gardens
were intact and that what tsunami victims needed most was help to
rebuild their lives.


Despite the phasing out of emergency operations, the disaster
office said there were still reports of food shortages, notably
rice, in Gizo, the major town affected by the disaster.


More rice would be sent to Gizo, said Julian Makaa of the
disaster relief office.


Rescue services were called out again late Thursday however when
a Taiwan relief vessel struck a reef after delivering supplies to
Gizo.


The head of Marine Search and Rescue Jack Bana said no one was
injured and helicopters were used to lift off Red Cross staff and
patients who were being ferried to hospitals in the capital
Honiara.


Maritime authorities had warned last week of submerged reefs
caused by the recent quake.
