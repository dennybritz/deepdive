China's Social Security Fund will invest more than 100 billion
yuan (12.9 billion dollars) across markets this year, hitting a
historic high, state media reported Friday.


"We have to beat inflation, and we have to win," said Xiang
Huaicheng, chairman of the National Council for the Social
Security Fund, according to the Shanghai Securities News.


Xiang, a former finance minister, told a meeting in Beijing that
the annual compound return on assets since the launch of the fund
had been 3.9 percent, 2.8 times the inflation rate for the
period.


"It would have been be a mistake if we had deposited all (the
funds) into banks and lost out to inflation," he said.


With its market capitalization totalling 326.8 billion yuan at
the end of 2006, the Social Security Fund has 45.9 percent of
assets in fixed income products, 10.5 percent in company shares,
and 9.5 percent in cash and others.


The rest, a little more than 34 percent, was in publicly traded
stocks, more than a limit set in 2006 for stocks to account for
30 percent of total assets.


The main reason why the limit was breached was the rapid
appreciation of stock assets.


"We'll maintain the upper limit of stock assets at 30 percent of
our portfolio," he said.
