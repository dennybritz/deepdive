The World Bank's executive board early Friday insisted president
Paul Wolfowitz never won its approval for hefty pay hikes they
said he personally ordered for his girlfriend at the global
lender.


Reporting the findings of an investigation into the scandal
surrounding his Libyan-born partner, Shaha Riza, the bank's 24
executive directors appeared to raise serious questions over
Wolfowitz's handling of the affair.


In a statement, the board said Wolfowitz had sent a memorandum to
the World Bank's human resources vice president "directing him to
reach an agreement with the staff member (Riza) and specifying in
detail the terms and conditions."


Contrary to claims by Wolfowitz aides, the board said that the
World Bank's ethics committee "had not been involved in the
discussions with the concerned staff member."


"Neither did it find that the terms and conditions of the
agreement had been commented on, reviewed or approved by the
ethics committee, its chairman or the board."
