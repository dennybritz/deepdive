James Blake booked his quarter-final berth in the 416,000-dollar
US claycourt championships here Thursday with a straight set win
over qualifier Alex Kuznetsov.


Blake, who is shaking off a run of disappoining results, defeated
Kuznetsov 7-6, (7/4), 6-1 to line up a clash with eighth-seeded
Argentinian Juan Monaco.


Monaco defeated American Amer Delic 6-2, 6-3.


Blake had been struggling before he posted a pair of victories
against Spain last weekend in the Davis Cup - the second in a
dead rubber.


However, he appears to be returning to the early season form that
saw him reach two finals - including a successful title defense
in Sydney.


Monaco also has a title to his credit this year, having picked up
his first career ATP trophy in Buenos Aires.


In this tournament, Blake is seeking to make it past the quarter-
finals for the first time in six appearances.


Third-seeded German Tommy Haas also advanced to the quarter-
finals, with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over France's Nicolas Devilder.


Haas reached the semi-finals here last year before being forced
to retire with a wrist injury.


Haas next faces Croatian Ivo Karlovic, who advanced on a walkover
when Argentina's Diego Hartfield withdrew with a neck injury.


The other two quarter-final match-ups had already been decided.


Spain's Albert Montanes will face American Vince Spadea, while
fifth seeded Jurgen Melzer of Austria will face Argentinian
qualifier Mariano Zabaleta.


Zabaleta ousted defending champion and fourth seed Mardy Fish in
the second round.


The tournament was already without top seed Andy Roddick, who
withdrew before his opening match with a lingering hamstring
injury.
