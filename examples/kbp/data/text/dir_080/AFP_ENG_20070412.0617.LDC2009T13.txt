World number one Annika Sorenstam, who has had an injury-free
13-year career up to this point, has pulled out of the USLPGA
Ginn Open with a back injury.


Sorenstam withdrew from the event Thursday morning with a
ruptured disc in her back, an injury that will sideline the
Swedish star for a month.


Sorenstam was diagnosed with the injury Wednesday afternoon.


The Swede, who is already in the LPGA and World Golf Hall of
Fame, has won 10 majors and earned more than 20 million dollars
in her career.


"I've been playing with quite a bit of pain for the past several
weeks," Sorenstam said.


"I couldn't take it much more and decided it was time to see
someone after the pro-am yesterday. I withdraw with deep regret,
as the Ginn Open is one of the finest tournaments we have, and it
is in my hometown of Orlando."


Sorenstam has a pair of top-10 finishes in three events this
year.


The favorite to win here this week now will be Lorena Ochoa, who
is looking to overtake Sorenstam for the top ranking.
