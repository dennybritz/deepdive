China will gradually raise the cap on the amount of money
insurers can invest in stocks from the current five percent of
their total assets, state media said Friday, citing a top
industry regulator.


"We will allow (more investment) little by little according to
the demand in the market," said Wu Dingfu, chairman of the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission, according to the Shanghai
Securities News.


"We... have to respect the opinions of companies," Wu told a
forum at Peking University.


The newspaper said the total assets of China's insurance industry
have hit two trillion yuan (259 billion dollars).


Apart from the five percent quota for stock investment, insurance
companies have been allowed to invest in infrastructure projects
to diversify their portfolios.
