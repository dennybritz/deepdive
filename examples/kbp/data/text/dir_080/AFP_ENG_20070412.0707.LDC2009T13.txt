The America's Cup has come a long way since John Cox Stevens,
founder of the New York Yacht Club, sailed across the Atlantic on
America to cross sails with a British fleet off the Isle of Wight
in 1851.


The prize that year was the Auld Mug - a cup shaped a little like
an Aladdin's lamp and worth the princely sum of 100 guineas.


For the next 132 years yachting's most coveted trophy - renamed
in honour of its first winner - took up permanent residence in
the United States.


Sport's longest winning sequence was only broken in 1983 when
Australia II and her innovative winged keel design defeated
Liberty 4-3 off Newport but Stars And Stripes restored US pride
four years later in Freemantle.


New Zealand's Black Magic broke the US dominance again in 1995
with Team New Zealand keeping the Kiwis' hands on yachting's holy
grail in 2000 in the only edition not to feature a US competitor.


The Auld Mug's presence on a sideboard in Valencia this summer is
due to the stunning success of Swiss team Alinghi off Auckland in
2003 when she meted out a 5-0 drubbing to the defenders.


The trophy has finally returned to Europe after a 156 year
absence but BMW Oracle Racing from San Francisco and Team New
Zealand are among those out to do their utmost to ensure that its
stay on this continent is only temporary.
