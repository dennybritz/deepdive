Chinese authorities have vowed to purge the Internet in China of
pornography amid rising disgust over the explicit content in
cyberspace, state press reported Friday.


The curtains will be drawn on cyber strip-shows while sexually
explicit audio and video clips will be erased as 10 government
departments spend the next six months removing pornography from
the Web, Xinhua news agency said.


"The boom in pornographic content on the Internet has
contaminated  cyberspace and perverted China's young minds,"
Xinhua quoted the public security ministry's vice minister, Zhang
Xinfeng, as saying.


Online pornography is already illegal and China takes great
efforts to ban offending sites, but cyber-sex remains widely
available to anyone who wants to search hard enough.


"The inflow of pornographic materials from abroad and lax
domestic controls are to blame for the existing problems in
China's cyberspace," Zhang said.


Xinhua said authorities believed China's young minds were being
corrupted by the temptations on offer.


"The Chinese government believes they need to be protected from
negative online influences," it said.


Xinhua cited a report from a Beijing rehabilitation centre for
juvenile delinquents as saying that 33.5 percent of its detainees
had been influenced by violent online games or erotic websites
when they committed their crimes.
