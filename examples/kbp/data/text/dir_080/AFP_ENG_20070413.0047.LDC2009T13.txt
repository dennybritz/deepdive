The UN's rights envoy to Cambodia on Friday condemned an appeals
court's refusal to overturn the convictions of two men widely
thought to be wrongfully accused of killing a key labour leader.


Despite fresh evidence pointing towards their innocence, a panel
of judges Thursday upheld 20-year prison terms for Born Samnang
and Sok Sam Oeun over the 2004 murder of unionist Chea Vichea.


Rights envoy Yash Ghai said the ruling "underlines already
existing concerns about judicial independence, the rule of law
and continuing impunity in Cambodia."


"The prosecution failed to present credible evidence linking the
two men to the death of Chea Vichea," he said. "The trial was
conducted in violation of international human rights standards."


One of the key prosecution witnesses recanted, saying the
unionist had been shot by other gunmen, and the former Phnom Penh
police chief who led the investigation also admitted last year
that the two did not kill Chea Vichea.


But judge Saly Theara said Thursday that the appeals court
"doesn't believe the witnesses at all," according to local media
reports.
