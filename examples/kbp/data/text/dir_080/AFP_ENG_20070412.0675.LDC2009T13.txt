An experimental influenza vaccine produced in insect cells
appears safe and effective in healthy adults, says a preliminary
US study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.


The results offer the promise of a more rapid development of
vaccines against flu or avian influenza in case of a pandemic,
say the study's authors, scientists at the University of
Rochester in New York state, in JAMA's April 11 edition.


Until now, all seasonal flu vaccines have been grown in chicken
eggs.


That system requires specialized manufacturing facilities and
production "could be difficult to scale up rapidly in response to
an emerging need such as a pandemic," doctor John Treanor and his
colleagues wrote.


Using recombinant DNA techniques, the researchers produced an
experimental vaccine from an insect and tested it on 460 healthy
adults in three hospital centers in the United States during the
flu seasons of 2004 and 2005.


Recombinant cellular vaccines have been successfully used for two
decades against hepatitis B, and more recently against human
papillomavirus, certain types of which cause cervical cancer.


Research is underway to develop a vaccine of this type against
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
