Russia's security council secretary said in an interview
broadcast Thursday that he was confident Israeli soldiers
kidnapped by Islamic militants would be released.


"Because of our efforts and the efforts of other mediators ...
the issue will be resolved," Igor Ivanov said in an interview
broadcast on Russian channel Vesti 24 after he visited the Middle
East this week.


"Not only will the prisoners of war be able to return home safe
and sound, but it will also be a good signal for political
efforts that have to be undertaken to reach a total resolution of
the situation in the Middle East."


Ivanov was in Jerusalem on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Ramallah on
Thursday.


The broadcaster reported that Ivanov was referring to Israeli
soldiers Gilad Shalit and Ehud Goldwasser, although another
Israeli serviceman, Eldad Regev, is also missing.


Shalit was abducted in a cross-border raid on June 25 by
militants from three groups, including the armed wing of Hamas.


Goldwasser and Regev were kidnapped on July 12 during a Hezbollah
militia operation at the Israeli-Lebanon border, which also
resulted in the deaths of three soldiers.


The June seizure led to a massive Israeli incursion into the Gaza
Strip and the deaths of some 400 Palestinians. The July capture
provoked a 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in which more
than 1,200 Lebanese -- mostly civilians and one-third of them
children -- were killed.
