A pan-European security organisation said Thursday that Kosovo
had to improve its justice system to uphold human rights and the
rule of law.


The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
said in a report that it had identified "weaknesses in the
applicable administrative law, problems with administrative
decisions ... (and a) lack of judicial review" of decisions made
by the UN and NATO missions in the Serbian province.


"These challenges, which appear when establishing a functioning
administrative law system as a fundamental part of developing
Kosovo's justice system, are not unsurpassable," said Jens
Modvig, acting head of the OSCE mission in Kosovo.


The report notified a backlog of over 2,000 cases, and suggested
amending the existing administrative law system in Kosovo, as
well as recommending a Kosovo supreme court to function as an
appeal court.


"Administrative law is an important area because it enables
citizens to have the right to review government actions they
believe are illegal or arbitrary," Modvig said.


Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since mid-1999, when a
NATO bombing campaign ended a Serbian crackdown on the province's
independence-seeking ethnic Albanian majority.


In the coming weeks, the UN Security Council is to decide on
Kosovo's future status based on a recommendation by special envoy
Martti Ahtisaari for it to be granted internationally supervised
independence.
