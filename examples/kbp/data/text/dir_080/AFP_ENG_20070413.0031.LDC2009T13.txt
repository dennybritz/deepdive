Chinese share prices were flat in Friday morning trade as
investors took a breather after nine consecutive days of record
gains, dealers said.


They said the market clawed back to neutral territory after
investors booked profits following recent gains in power and
textile listings, amid ongoing confidence that stock prices can
continue to climb.


"The market saw some profit-taking in early morning after the key
index rose above the 3,500-points level, but then it quickly
recovered as sentiment remains optimistic," said Wang Jun, an
analyst at Merchants Securities.


"The strong performance is likely to continue over the next week,
as more companies issue their annual and quarterly results, most
of which are believed to be stronger-than-expected."


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares, ended the morning up 0.45 points or 0.01 percent at
3,531.48, after hitting a fresh record high of 3,539.98.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 0.31 points or 0.01 percent at
3,712.54 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was up 11.07 points or
1.11 percent at 1,004.33, a new record.
