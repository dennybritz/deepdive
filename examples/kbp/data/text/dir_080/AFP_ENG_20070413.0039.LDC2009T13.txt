A Vietnamese court has jailed 12 members of an illegal online
football betting ring and handed suspended terms to 10 more
defendants, the state-run Vietnam New Agency said Friday.


The network based in Ho Chi Minh City took online bets worth up
to 50,000 dollars per day on matches in the Vietnamese domestic
league and in Germany, Italy, Spain, Britain and in the European
Championships from 2003 to 2005.


The Ho Chi Minh City People's Court on Thursday sentenced 22
defendants -- three to between four and seven years and nine to
between one and three years, the state media report said.


Ten members of the network were given suspended sentences of one
to three years, the news agency said.


Football betting and other forms of gambling are illegal but
widespread in communist-ruled Vietnam, where many fans place bets
online with networks based inside the country or in Hong Kong,
Macau and other cities.
