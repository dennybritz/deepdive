Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev said Thursday he wanted
to create an independent television channel to encourage
democracy and press freedom, a news agency reported.


"I think there is a problem with freedom of the press," he said,
according to Ria Novosti news agency. "The press's attention has
been diverted from important problems."


Speaking at a Russian-German forum in Kaliningrad, Gorbachev said
he and others had proposed creating an independent television
station.


"Without democracy and without freedom of the press, citizens
will not be able to understand all that is happening with the
country," he said.


Gorbachev has owned shares in Novaja Gazeta, the newspaper for
which slain investigative journalist and government critic Anna
Politkovskaya worked.


Politkovskaya was shot in her apartment building in an execution-
style killing last October that Gorbachev called a "political
homicide."


Her murder raised fears about freedom of the press in Russia,
where at least 42 journalists have been killed since the Soviet
collapse in 1991, and resulted in heavy criticism of President
Vladimir Putin.
