Canada is joining the international Coalition Against Wildlife
Trafficking, Canadian and US officials announced Thursday during
a visit to the Washington zoo.


"Our participation in this coalition further demonstrates our
commitment to enforcing environmental laws," Canadian Environment
Minister John Baird said in a statement.


The bloc was founded in 2005 to stem poaching and the illegal
trade of plants and animals.


Its members, which already include the United States, Australia,
India and Britain as well as 14 conservation and industry
organizations, work within their spheres of influence to stamp
out the illegal activity.


Claudia McMurray, Assistant Secretary for Oceans and
International Environmental and Scientific Affairs at the US
State Department, heralded Canada's help in "combating criminal
activity ... that is threatening so many wildlife species with
extinction."


The coalition must persevere in trying to "halt the loss of
biodiversity by curbing both the supply and demand for wildlife
and wildlife products," she said.
