Australian star fly-half Stephen Larkham is considering an offer
to join leading French club Toulouse after this year's World Cup,
reports said Friday.


The club has made Larkham a "lucrative" offer to take over from
Frederik Michalak, who has opted to join the Natal Sharks for
next year's Super 14 tournament, rugbyexclusive.com reported.


"The idea of playing for a great club like Toulouse is very
attractive and it certainly would be another challenge," the
rangy playmaker was quoted as saying.


"My French is terrible, but hopefully they'll also speak a bit of
English to help me through."


His Wallabies and Brumbies teammate, scrum-half George Gregan,
has already agreed to play with French second-division club
Toulon after the World Cup.


Larkham, 32, began his test career against Wales in Sydney in
1996 and has since earned a total of 95 caps. He will be playing
in his third World Cup campaign.


He has already made it clear that 2007 will be his farewell
season in Australia.
