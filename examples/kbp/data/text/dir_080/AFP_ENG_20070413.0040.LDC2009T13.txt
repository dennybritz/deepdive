A Malaysian teacher was dealt a rude shock when she was caned on
her backside by the school's principal, who mistook her for a
student, according to state media.


The secondary school teacher said she was dressed in Malay
martial arts attire and ushering some students back to their
classrooms Wednesday after extra- curricular activities when she
was whacked.


"Suddenly and without asking questions, the female principal who
was patrolling the area caned me on the buttocks and also caned
several other students," the teacher was quoted as telling the
state Bernama news agency late Thursday.


"I was ashamed because all the students ... saw the incident,"
she said.


The teacher said the principal had apologised for mistaking her
for a student, but that she had lodged a complaint with
Malaysia's National Union of the Teaching Profession.


"Although she did not know me because she was transferred to the
school two weeks ago, there was no reason not to ask me," said
the teacher.


The union told Bernama it had called on the education ministry to
investigate the incident.
