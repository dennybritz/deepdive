Two more US soldiers died in Iraq, one in an insurgent attack
when his patrol was struck by small arms fire, the military
reported Friday.


The soldier was killed north of Baghdad, it said but did not
specify when the attack took place.


Another soldier died Thursday in a "non-battle" death, the
military said without providing details.


The latest fatalities brought the US military's losses in Iraq to
36 in this month alone and to 3,290 since the March 2003 invasion
to 3,290, according to Pentagon figures released Thursday.
