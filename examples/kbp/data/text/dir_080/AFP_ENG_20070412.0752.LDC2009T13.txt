South Korea's Samsung Electronics on Friday said net profit
during the three months to March fell 15 percent from a year
earlier due to weak chip prices.


The weaker-than-expected performance sent Samsung shares down 0.8
percent to trade around 599,000 won in mid-morning.


In the first quarter the company made a net profit of 1.6
trillion won (1.7 billion dollars), down 15 percent from a year
earlier, on revenue of 14.39 trillion won, up 3.1 percent.


Operating profit for the quarter was 1.18 trillion won, down 26.7
percent year- on-year.


"There were many difficulties in the first quarter due to
sluggish demand for key products and a decline in their prices
due to an oversupply in a seasonally weak period of the IT
industry," the company said in a statement.


"Nevertheless, we believe we have secured a footing for better
earnings by focusing on enhancing competitiveness in the long run
rather than pursuing short-term profits."


It noted that the price for semiconductor products had begun to
stabilise in March and market conditions were expected to recover
in the second half.
