Security agents in Nigeria have shut down a private radio and a
television station ahead of Saturday's state governorship and
parliamentary elections, Reporters Without Borders said Thursday.


The France-based organisation called on the federal government to
reopen Link FM and GTV, two new Lagos-based stations shut down by
the security agents.


"Elections should be a time when the government takes more care
than ever to respect the rule of law," said an RWB statement.


"Instead, the security forces are sent without a warrant to shut
down media that could be a nuisance during the polling.


"There is no justification for the enforced closure of Link FM
and GTV, so the measure should be lifted and their personnel
should be allowed to return to work," the statement said.


Eight security agents burst into the Link FM and GTV studios in
Lagos at about 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Wednesday, ordering all the
employees to leave and placing seals over the entrances, the text
said.


They said they were acting on "an order from above." The studios
were still closed the following morning and staff were not
allowed to enter, it added.


The two stations began broadcasting just a few weeks ago.


As yet there has been no official statement on the issue.


Listeners said that the two stations have gone off air since
Wednesday.
