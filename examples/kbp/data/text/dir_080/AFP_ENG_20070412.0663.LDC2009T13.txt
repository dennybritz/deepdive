A man convicted of embezzling money from the Canadian embassy in
the Czech Republic while he worked as an accountant there was
sentenced to seven years in prison Thursday.


Czech national Karel Truhlar, 31, was accused of having taken
some 18.4 million koruna (659,000 euros, 888,000 dollars) from
the embassy bank account between April 1998 and September 1999.


Truhlar had maintained his innocence throughout the trial at the
Prague municipal court.


Deposits to his bank account corresponded roughly to sums
withdrawn from the embassy account, which Truhlar described as
coincidence. His monthly salary at the time was 20,000 koruna
(716 euros, 965 dollars), and prosecutors said he lived far above
his means.


Truhlar also admitted that he had no formal qualifications as an
accountant. He said his mother, who had worked as an accountant
in the embassy, taught him and helped him get the job.
