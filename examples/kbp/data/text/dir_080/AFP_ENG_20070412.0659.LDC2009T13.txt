Toronto police said Thursday they are searching for a suspect who
molested a 91 -year-old bedridden woman in hospital after
claiming to be a doctor.


"When she awoke, the suspect was standing beside her bed,"
authorities said in a statement on Wednesday night's incident.
"The suspect identified himself as a new doctor and then sexually
assaulted the victim."


The woman managed to alert nurses and pushed the man away.


The man, described as caucasian, in his 40s and unshaven, wearing
a baseball cap and a plaid (tartan) jacket, fled and was last
seen standing at a nearby bus shelter.
