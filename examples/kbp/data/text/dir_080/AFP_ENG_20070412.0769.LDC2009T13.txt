Australia's top rugby executive Gary Flowers announced his
resignation Friday, paving the way for the possible return of his
predecessor John O'Neill after this year's World Cup.


Flowers, who has been criticised for a lack of leadership and
recently lost the support of the Australian Rugby Union (ARU)
board, said he will leave when his contract expires on December
31, 2007.


"After much thought and discussion with my family I have informed
the chairman and the board of the ARU that I will not be seeking
to enter a new contract," he told a press conference.


Flowers replaced O'Neill as the ARU's chief executive in June
2004.


O'Neill, who said he was driven out of the game by internal
wrangling, saw the Wallabies reach two World Cup finals including
a win in 1999, and oversaw the successful hosting of the 2003
Rugby World Cup.


Since his departure, rugby union in Australia has been wracked by
internal divisions and the Wallabies have struggled to make an
impact on the field.


O'Neill, now with a sports marketing and management company, said
he had no immediate plans to take on his old job.


"My affection for rugby is unabated. If the right opportunity
came to assist rugby, I would consider it. At this juncture no
such opportunity has arisen," he told the Sydney Morning Herald.
