Sri Lanka were 187-4 after 40 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against New Zealand at the Grenada National Stadium
here on Thursday chasing 220 to win.


Kumar Sangakkara was on 50 and Tillakaratne Dilshan was on two.


Opener Upal Tharanga was the first man out caught by Shane Bond
in the deep off James Franklin for 11 with the total on 30 in the
fifth over.


Sanath Jayasuriya put on 100 for the second wicket with
Sangakarra before he went caught behind by Brendon McCullum off
Jacob Oram for 64 off 80 balls.


Captain Mahela Jayawardene was the third man out caught by
substitute fielder Hamish Marshall off spinner Daniel Vettori for
15 in the 31st over with the total having moved on to 152.


Vettori than got rid of Chamara Silva, caught by Bond, in the
38th over after the batsman had made a rapid 23 with his wicket
falling on 180.


Earlier Scott Styris's unbeaten 111 saw him score more than half
New Zealand's runs as they made 219 for seven off 50 overs.


Styris, in at four for two after left-arm quick Chaminda Vaas
dismissed both New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming and Ross
Taylor for nought, had previously scored three fifties this
tournament.


Vaas, a member of the Sri Lanka side that won the 1996 World Cup,
finished with three for 33 from nine overs.


Off-spin star Muttiah Muralitharan, another of Sri Lanka's World
Cup winners, followed up Vaas's burst with three for 32 to become
the joint-leading wicket- taker in the tournament, moving level
with Malinga and Australia quick Glenn McGrath on 15 wickets.
