Iran condemned as inhuman and satanic Thursday's attack inside
the Iraqi parliament complex that killed two MPs, the official
IRNA news agency reported.


"This inhuman and satanic action was carried out by enemies who
wish only bad for the Iraqi people and who targeted deputies
whether they were Sunni or Shiite," said foreign ministry
spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini.


Hosseini called for unity among Iraqis and the withdrawal of the
occupation forces, the agency said.


Thursday's suicide bomb attack in a cafeteria in the Iraqi
parliament in Baghdad's Green Zone killed eight people, including
at least two MPs and wounded at least 20, an Iraqi official said.


It was a staggering breach of security at the country's most
heavily guarded site.


The blast, which came hours after a suicide truck bomber targeted
a Baghdad bridge killing 10 people, came despite a massive US-
Iraqi security crackdown launched in the capital two months ago.
