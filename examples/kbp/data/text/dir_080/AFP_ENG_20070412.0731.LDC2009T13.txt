The British foreign ministry said on Thursday that the blog of a
British diplomat in Bangkok had been withdrawn after accusations
that he had been spotted in the city's red light district.


Ian Proud, whose blog was posted on the website of the Thai
national newspaper The Nation, denied the "malicious accusations"
made on the site, the foreign ministry said.


"These were personal comments made by a member of the British
Embassy in Bangkok," a Foreign Office spokesman said.


"He is a member of the diplomatic service and as such we do not
comment ... I believe the blog has been withdrawn."


"Ian has been the victim of malicious accusations about his
personal behaviour. He has rejected such accusations."


The foreign ministry also said it was reviewing its policy on
allowing diplomats to write blogs.


Proud, 38, has admitted to visiting Cowboy Street in the Thai
capital, part of the city's red light district, but has been
quoted as saying that "the suggestion that I'm some sort of
upholder of the sex trade in Bangkok ... It's pathetic, frankly."


Proud's four-year tenure in Bangkok as head of the British
embassy's political section is set to end next month, according
to his profile in the blog.
