A Muslim council in Malaysia has issued a religious ruling or
fatwa banning people from using the Internet to trade shares or
makes investments, reports said Friday.


National Fatwa Council chairman Abdul Shukor Husin said non-
Muslim investment schemes accessed through the Internet pay
interest and guarantee a steady profit, which is banned under
Islamic or sharia law.


"We advise those making investments via the Internet to stop
immediately," Abdul Shukor was quoted as saying in Malay-language
daily Berita Harian.


"There are many alternative investment schemes based on Islamic
principles initiated by the government which Muslims can
participate in," he said.


Islamic funds ban the earning of interest and cannot invest in
companies associated with tobacco, alcohol or gambling, which are
considered taboo by Muslims.
