Apple Inc. said on Thursday it is delaying the release of its new
Leopard operating system in order to get its much-ballyhooed
iPhone to market in June as promised.


Apple originally planned to unleash the Leopard operating system
for its Macintosh computers in trademark theatrical style at its
Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco in June.


Software engineers and quality assurance teams were shifted from
working on Leopard to crafting and testing the iPhone, according
to the Cupertino, California-based company.


"iPhone contains the most sophisticated software ever shipped on
a mobile device, and finishing it on time has not come without a
price," Apple said in a statement.


"Life often presents tradeoffs and, in this case, we're sure
we've made the right one."


Apple chief executive Steve Jobs in January unveiled the iPhone,
a new mobile phone that can also be used as a digital music
player and camera.


Apple said its heralded Leopard operating system will be finished
by June but will still be in the testing phase. Leopard should
ship in October, according to Apple.
