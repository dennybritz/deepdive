China may impose a licensing system on its steel exporters if
current measures fail to slow down growth in overseas shipments,
state media reported Friday.


Licensing may be unavoidable if a recent cut in tax rebates fails
to slow exports, the Shanghai Securities News said, citing
officials from industry organisations.


The China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals Chemicals
Importers and Exporters may propose a licensing regime on 26
major steel product categories to effectively control exports,
said Chen Haoran, president of the chamber.


On April 9, China announced that it would remove value-added tax
rebates for some steel product exports while reducing the rebates
on some others from April 15 after steel export surged in the
first quarter.


Exports of steel products amounted to 14.1 million tonnes in the
first three months, up 118.4 percent from a year earlier while
billet exports rose 98.1 percent to 1.8 million tonnes during the
period.
