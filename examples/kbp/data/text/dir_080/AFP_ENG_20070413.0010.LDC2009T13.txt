China has approved a new firm that will manage Shanghai's 1.3
-billion-dollar retirement pension after last year's huge scandal
involving theft from the fund, state press reported Friday.


Changjiang Pension Fund will have registered capital of 500
million yuan (64.7 million), with 11 stakeholders made up of
major state-owned enterprises based in the financial hub, the
Shanghai Daily reported.


Among them are Shanghai Baosteel Group, the country's biggest
steelmaker, Shenergy Group, Shanghai Airport Group and Shanghai
International Group, the city government's investment arm, the
newspaper said.


Shanghai Pudong Development Bank's vice president Ma Li will be
the chairwoman and general manager of the new company.


The overhaul is a response to the far-reaching graft case that
involved the theft of social security money totalling 3.7 billion
yuan (480 million dollars) including interest for investment in
speculative property and highway projects.


It led to the arrest of more than 20 party bureaucrats and
businessmen, including former city boss Chen Liangyu in the
highest-level firing of a government official in China in more
than a decade.
