A US Food and Drug Administration panel overwhelmingly opposed
Thursday marketing approval for Merck's new anti-inflammatory
drug to treat arthritis, a spokesman for the regulator said.


The consultative panel voted 20-1 against recommending to the FDA
that Arcoxia should be allowed on the market, he said, without
giving further detail.


The FDA is not compelled to follow panel recommendations but in
practice usually does.


The lopsided vote apparently reflects concerns about the risks
presented by the new drug, which belongs to the same class of
anti-inflammatories, called COX-2, as Merck's Vioxx.


The US drugs giant voluntarily withdrew Vioxx from the world
market in 2004 after a study showed it was linked to an increased
risk of heart attacks and strokes.


Arcoxia is already authorized in some 60 nations and last year
generated total sales of 265 million dollars, a small portion of
the 22 billion dollars in revenue reported by the Whitehouse
Station, New Jersey-based firm.
