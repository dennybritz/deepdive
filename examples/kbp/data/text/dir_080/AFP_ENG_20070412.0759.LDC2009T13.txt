Japanese share prices were narrowly mixed in subdued morning
trade on Friday as investors kept a cautious stance ahead of a
meeting of the world's top finance ministers, dealers said,


They said that the market had drawn only limited support from
gains seen overnight on Wall Street, with the upcoming corporate
earnings season also keeping a lid on sentiment.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 24.75 points or 0.14 percent to 17,565.17 by lunch. But the
broader TOPIX index of all first- section issues dropped 0.84
points to 1,725.34.
