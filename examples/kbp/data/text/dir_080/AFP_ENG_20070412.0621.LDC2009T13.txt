Sri Lanka were 150-2 after 30 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against New Zealand at the Grenada National Stadium
here on Thursday chasing 220 to win.


Kumar Sangakkara was on 41 and skipper Mahela Jayawardene on 15.


Opener Upal Tharanga was the first man out caught by Shane Bond
in the deep off James Franklin for 11 with the total on 30 in the
fifth over.


Sanath Jayasuriya put on 100 for the second wicket with
Sangakarra before he went caught behind by Brendon McCullum off
Jacob Oram for 64 off 80 balls.


Earlier Scott Styris's unbeaten 111 saw him score more than half
New Zealand's runs as they made 219 for seven off 50 overs.


Styris, in at four for two after left-arm quick Chaminda Vaas
dismissed both New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming and Ross
Taylor for nought, had previously scored three fifties this
tournament.


Vaas, a member of the Sri Lanka side that won the 1996 World Cup,
finished with three for 33 from nine overs.


Off-spin star Muttiah Muralitharan, another of Sri Lanka's World
Cup winners, followed up Vaas's burst with three for 32 to become
the joint-leading wicket- taker in the tournament, moving level
with Malinga and Australia quick Glenn McGrath on 15 wickets.
