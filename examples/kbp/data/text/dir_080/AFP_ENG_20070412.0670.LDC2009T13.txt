The Los Angeles Times and Paramount studios have reached a
settlement with authorities over a publicity stunt for "Mission:
Impossible III" that sparked a bomb scare, prosecutors said
Thursday.


Around 4,500 newspaper boxes across California were rigged with
devices in April 2006 that played the "Mission: Impossible" theme
when customers opened them in the build-up to the release of the
Tom Cruise blockbuster.


But several customers thought the music players were bombs and
reported them to law enforcement officials. An arson squad blew
up one of the newspaper boxes in Santa Clarita, just north of Los
Angeles, as a precaution.


In West Los Angeles, federal police at the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center called the bomb squad after a newspaper buyer
spotted wires rigged to the music player within the box. Hospital
officials evacuated the building.


Los Angeles Times Communications, LLC, Paramount Pictures
Corporation, and Allied Advertising have now paid a 75,000 dollar
settlement in relation to the incident at the veteran's hospital.


The settlement was paid without admission of wrongdoing by any of
the parties involved, a statement from federal prosecutors said.
