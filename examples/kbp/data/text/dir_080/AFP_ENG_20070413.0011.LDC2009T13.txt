A surprise Indian missile test forced an Indonesian airliner
packed with passengers to turn around and head home, threatening
a diplomatic spat, a report said Friday.


The Garuda Indonesia jet, full of Muslim pilgrims en route to
Saudi Arabia,  had reached Indian airspace when the nuclear-
capable ballistic missile streaked across the sky on Thursday,
forcing the plane to turn around.


"There was no prior information about the test," the national
carrier's operations director Ari Sapari was quoted as saying by
the Kompas newspaper.


Indonesia's foreign ministry could lodge a formal protest over
the incident, Transport Minister Hatta Rajasa reportedly said.


The Boeing 747 jet carrying 400 people aborted its flight after
90 minutes and returned to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, the
report said.


"This clearly disrupted our schedule and caused us big losses,"
Sapari was quoted as saying. The plane resumed its journey four
hours later.


The jet's exact location relative to the missile, which trailed
orange and yellow smoke as it rocketed skyward, was unspecified
in the report.
