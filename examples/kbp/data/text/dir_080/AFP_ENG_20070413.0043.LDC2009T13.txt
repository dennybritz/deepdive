North Korea said Friday it would start scrapping its nuclear
programme after a long-running banking dispute is resolved.


The foreign ministry, in a statement carried by official media,
said it would "confirm soon" whether its funds in a Macau bank
had been unfrozen, as the United States has claimed.


Pyongyang has refused to take further steps to dismantle its
nuclear programme until it recovers the 25 million dollars,
frozen since late 2005.
