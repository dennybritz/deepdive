Adelaide United has released former Chinese international Qu
Shengqing after an injury-plagued A-League season, the Australian
club said Friday.


United chief executive Michael Petrillo said Qu, the club's
marquee' player for the past two seasons, would not be offered a
contract extension for the next A-League season.


He said the former Chinese international had rejoined his family
in Shanghai after an injury-filled six months.


Qu played only seven games for a return of one goal as he was
troubled by a serious ankle injury, which required the striker to
undergo surgery last December.


"Unfortunately for Qu the last season hasn't gone as we would
have liked due to persistent problems with his ankle," Petrillo
said in a club statement.


"However we all know that at his best he was a terrific
contributor to the club and the league as he showed in his first
season."


Qu was equal top scorer with seven goals for United in the
2005/06 season.
