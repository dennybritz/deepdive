US investment banking giant Morgan Stanley said Friday that it
will buy 13 Japanese hotels owned by All Nippon Airways Co. for a
record 281.3 billion yen (2.4 billion dollars).


The transaction is believed to be the largest real estate deal in
Japanese history.


"The acquisition will build on Morgan Stanley's global hotel
investment strategy and represents a unique opportunity to expand
its portfolio of high quality properties in key cities in Japan,"
Morgan Stanley said in a statement.


Morgan Stanley will acquire such properties as the flagship ANA
Intercontinental Tokyo hotel in the capital Tokyo as well as the
Manza Beach Hotel and Resort in the southern Japanese island of
Okinawa.


ANA, Japan's second largest carrier, said it expected a one-off
profit from the sale but that it was still calculating the exact
amount.


The hotels will be operated by IHG ANA Hotels Group Japan, a
joint venture between the airline and the Intercontinental hotel
chain, Morgan Stanley said.


The US investment bank is set to become one of the largest hotel
owners in Japan, having already acquired major properties such as
the Westin Tokyo from Sapporo Holdings Ltd.


Japan's biggest real estate transaction to date was DaVinci
Advisors KK's 200 -billion-yen purchase of the Pacific Century
Place office building in Tokyo's posh Marunouchi district last
year.
