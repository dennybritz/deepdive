Infosys Technologies Ltd, India's second-biggest maker of
computer software, said Friday fourth quarter net profit surged
as it signed up more clients overseas.


The Bangalore-based company's profit rose to 11.4 billion rupees
(266.5 million dollars) in the three months ended March 31, from
6.73 billion rupees a year earlier.


The earnings are based on Indian accounting principles and
calculated after tax and one-time expenses.
