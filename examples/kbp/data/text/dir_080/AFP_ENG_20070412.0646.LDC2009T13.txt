Argentine football star Diego Maradona defied medical advice in
quitting hospital and may have to continue treatment for
alcoholism for the rest of his life, his doctor said Thursday.


After earlier hailing Maradona's recovery, his personal doctor
Alfredo Cahe said he did not agree with the former Argentina
captain leaving hospital on Wednesday because there were still
tests and psychotherapy to be carried out on him.


Cahe had earlier said he was "astonished" at the 46-year-old
Maradona's recovery after 13 days in hospital for toxic hepatitis
induced by over-drinking.


"His whole family had to sign a document saying that even if his
progress is positive, he will still have to follow a second and a
third stage of treatment" and the care could last "all his life,"
Cahe told Del Plata radio.


"He is doing very well. His physical and mental state is normal,"
but the hospital made the patient and his family sign the
discharge papers as a "legal precaution," he said.


The Guemes Sanatorium where Maradona was treated said he would
get 24-hour home care for at least two weeks by a doctor,
psychiatrist and nurses. Doctors will then consider whether to
fly him to Switzerland for more treatment.


Maradona is regarded as one of the greatest figures in world
football, from a career that saw him play for Barcelona and
Napoli and captain his country to victory in the 1986 World Cup.


But his career on and off the field has been marred by repeated
drug and alcohol abuse.
