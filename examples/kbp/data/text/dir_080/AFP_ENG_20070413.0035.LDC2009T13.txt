Cars, buses and trucks jammed roads leading out of Phnom Penh on
Friday as tens of thousands left the Cambodian capital to kick
off the Buddhist New Year in their home provinces.


Overloaded buses, some with passengers clutching the sides or
sitting across engine hoods, snaked through narrow streets lined
with shuttered shop fronts as urban life came to a halt for the
long holiday weekend.


Those staying behind gathered on street corners to play
traditional New Year's games including tug-of-war. Others could
be seem cleaning their houses -- a symbolic act during the
Buddhist celebrations.


"It's a time to refresh," said Chuch Phoeurng, an under secretary
of state with the culture ministry.


"It is a break from the undesirable events of the past and entry
into a better time during the upcoming year."


Amid the revelry, however, the practice of throwing water and
talcum powder on passing motorists has been discouraged by the
government, which fears it could cause traffic accidents.
