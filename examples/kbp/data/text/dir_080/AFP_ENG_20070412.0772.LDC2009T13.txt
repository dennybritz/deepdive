One passenger was killed and 27 injured when a ferry collided
with what is believed to have been a whale off South Korea's
southern port of Busan, police said Friday.


The 263-tonne Kobee was bound for Busan from the Japanese city of
Fukuoka late Thursday with 215 pasengers and eight crew aboard.
It slammed into a large object while approaching its destination.


"We suppose it was a whale, judging from the fact that the water
around the ship turned scarlet, apparently from whale blood," a
spokeswoman for Busan maritime police told AFP.


"There were two similar collisions involving ships plying between
Busan and Japan and whales around this time last year," she said.


She said an increasing number of whales have been spotted off the
Korean peninsula, apparently due to the international ban on
whaling.


A 75-year-old South Korean woman died of a cerebral hemorrhage
while 27 people were taken to hospital after the accident 14
miles (22 kilometres) southeast of the Korean city.
