Russian authorities announced Thursday they would no longer
contract with PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for the annual audit
of the giant gas project Sakhaline-2, a news agency said.


A report from Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko said PwC's work
was considered "unsatisfactory in view of constant remarks made
about the presentation of auditing reports and reimbursable
costs," Interfax news agency reported.


Last month, a Russian court fined PwC 16.8 million rubles
(484,000 euros, 645,000 dollars) for its role in tax evasion by
bankrupt oil group Yukos in 2002-2004. The company had pledged to
appeal the decision.


The case was brought against PwC by the Russian revenue service
last December and involved allegations that PwC had drawn up two
versions of the Yukos 2002 accounts: one for shareholders and
another for management.


The firm also lost one of its largest Russian clients recently,
leading car manufacturer Avtovaz.


Gazprom gas giant has said it will continue to work with PwC,
which also has contracts with Russia's central bank and national
electricity monopoly SEU.
