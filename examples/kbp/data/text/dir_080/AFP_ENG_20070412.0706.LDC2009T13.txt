Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson was on
Thursday ordered to stand trial in August following his arrest
last year on drug possession charges.


Tyson was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, last December when he
was pulled over by police after leaving a nightclub. Police found
cocaine in his pocket and in his car, according to Maricopa
County Superior Court officials.


In late January, the troubled boxer who once styled himself the
"baddest man on the planet" pleaded not guilty to felony drug
possession charges and two misdemeanor counts of driving under
the influence of drugs.


During a hearing on Thursday Tyson's attorney, Richard Schonfeld,
asked for a month-long delay to view all the evidence in the
case. The delay was granted and Tyson's trial date was fixed for
August 20.


Prosecutors have said they plan to seek the maximum prison
sentence of seven- and-a-half years if Tyson is convicted on all
charges, a spokesman said.


Tyson served three years of a six-year sentence after his 1992
conviction for the rape of a beauty queen in an Indianopolis
hotel room.


He was also convicted of assaulting two motorists in Baltimore,
Maryland, in 1999 and served nine months of a year-long sentence.


Tyson rose to fame as the youngest world champion heavyweight in
history, and in his prime was considered unbeatable.


However, his later career was puncuated by controversy, the low
point coming when he was bannished from the ring for a year for
biting Evander Holyfield's ear during a 1997 fight.
