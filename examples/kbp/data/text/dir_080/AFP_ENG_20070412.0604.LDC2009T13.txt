Kosovo's telecommunications service chief escaped a second attack
on him unscathed Thursday, but a policeman escorting him was
critical injured, police said.


Anton Berisha's car came under an armed attack near Malisevo,
some 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest from the capital
Pristina, said Kosovo police spokesman Arber Beka.


"One policeman was injured and immediately transferred to the
hospital in Pristina," Beka said. Hospital sources said he was
fighting for his life.


Police have yet to confirm local media reports that three men had
been arrested in connection with the attacks.


Kosovo television showed footage of Berisha's car hit with what
looked like a mortar round.


It was the second armed attack on Berisha in two months and took
place just a few miles from the site of the previous attack on
February 28. Berisha has been under police protection since that
first attack.


No one has claimed responsibility for both attack, but local
media speculated it was linked to Berisha's role in awarding a
second mobile phone licence for the disputed Kosovo province.


Kosovo has been managed by a UN mission since mid-1999, when
three months of bombing by NATO ended a crackdown by Serbian
forces loyal to then president Slobodan Milosevic on the
province's independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.


In the coming weeks, the UN Security Council is to decide on
Kosovo's future status based on a recommendation by UN special
envoy Martti Ahtisaari for it to be granted internationally
supervised independence.
