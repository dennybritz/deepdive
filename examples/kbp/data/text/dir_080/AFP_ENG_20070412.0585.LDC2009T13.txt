Indonesian terror suspect Hambali has denied any links with Al-
Qaeda when he was member of the Southeast Asian Islamic extremist
group Jemaah Islamiyah, the Pentagon said Thursday.


Hambali, suspected of being a key JI member, was captured in
Thailand in 2003 and handed over to US authorities who are
detaining him at the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.


JI has long been suspected of having ties to the Al-Qaeda
network, which was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the
United States.


The Pentagon on Thursday released the transcript of Hamabli's
April 4 questioning by a military commission at Guantanamo.


Asked, "Mister Hambali, did you have any association with Al-
Qaeda while you were a member of JI?" he replied via a translator
"No."


Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, is one of the 14
suspects whose "enemy status" is being examined by military
commissions at Guantanamo.


The commissions are held behind closed-doors and the findings are
then published by the Pentagon after being censored.


JI has been blamed for a string of attacks, including the 2002
Bali bombings which left 202 people dead.
