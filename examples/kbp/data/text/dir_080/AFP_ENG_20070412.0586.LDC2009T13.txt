A new gold mine operated by a  Canadian mining firm is soon to
begin extraction in the northwestern African country of
Mauritania, a cabinet minister said Thursday.


"Production at Tasiast mine, whose construction is about to be
completed, will begin very soon," Industry and Mines Minister
Mohamed Ould Ismail Abeidna said during a trip to the mine, 270
kilometres (about 170 miles) north of the capital.


Canada's Rio Narcea Gold Mine has gone into a joint venture with
the Mauritanian government to develop the Tasiast mine to the
tune of 100 million dollars (74 million euros). The mine is
expected to produce four tonnes of pure gold every year over the
next 10 years.


Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, outgoing military junta leader who is to
hand over power to democratically elected leader Sidi Mohamed
Ould Sheik Abdallahi on April 19, also visited the site on
Thursday.


Mauritania, which became Africa's newest oil producer in 2006,
also produces some 12 million tonnes of iron each year.


In February the Islamic state started extracting copper and gold
in Akjoujt, 250 kilometres north of Nouakchott, and production is
estimated at 120.000 tonnes of concentrated copper and two tonnes
of gold per year.


Mauritania's mining sector, which represents between 12 and 15
percent of its gross domestic product and 55 percent of its
export earnings, is expected to boost the economy of this
impoverished desert country.
