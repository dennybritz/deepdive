Draconian policies aimed at preventing British prison inmates
from adopting Islamic extremist views are backfiring, a
researcher said Thursday.


Gabriele Marranci, a lecturer at Aberdeen University's school of
divinity and religious studies who carried out the study, said
the tough policies force Muslim inmates to keep to themselves in
a culture of secrecy.


"In particular, the decision in high-security prisons to suspend
access to certain television programmes or newspapers has
produced the opposite result that the establishment desired,"
Marranci said.


"The lack of freedom of expression that Muslim prisoners suffer
and the continuous atmosphere of suspicion surrounding them has
the effect of increasing a sense of frustration and depression
that a strong view of Islam can help to overcome."


Marranci, who conducted more than 170 interviews with current and
former Muslim prisoners in Britain over four years, said other
counter-productive measures include restricting communal praying
and barring prisoners from reading the Koran during work breaks.


"My findings suggest that the efforts made by the Prison Service
in Scotland, England and Wales to show that they are tackling
issues of radicalism in prison are instead facilitating the
formation of essentialist views of Islam," he said.


He said prison authorities had imposed certain security measures
under pressure from negative media coverage and criticism.
