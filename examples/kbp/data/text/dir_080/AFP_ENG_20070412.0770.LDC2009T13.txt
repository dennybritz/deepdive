China said on Friday it hoped a dispute over frozen North Korean
funds that has held up nuclear disarmament efforts could be
resolved, one day before a key deadline in the painstaking
process.


The United States announced this week that, with the approval of
authorities in Macau, 25 million dollars that had been frozen in
a bank there due to allegations of North Korean money laundering
were now available again.


However North Korea, which insists it will not close its Yongbyon
nuclear reactor by Saturday as agreed under a six-nation deal
brokered in February until it gets the money, has not yet said
whether it has recovered the funds.


"China has noticed the recent statements made by the US Treasury
Department and the Macau authorities, and we hope this could help
to properly resolve this problem," foreign ministry spokesman Qin
Gang said in a brief statement.


"We hope for and welcome constructive efforts from all sides to
push forward the process of the six-party talks."
