The 14th Budapest International Book Festival opened in the
Hungarian capital on Thursday, with Italian author Umberto Eco as
the special guest of the four-day event.


Eco, best known as the author of the "The Name of the Rose," will
be awarded later Thursday the Budapest Grand Prize by Mayor Gabor
Demszky.


The Hungarian translation of Eco's "The Mysterious Flame of Queen
Loana" will also be presented for the first time at the festival.


Publishing houses and authors from 25 countries are present,
including from Canada, which is also a special guest of the
festival.


More than 50,000 people visited the book festival last year.
