The nephew of the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks
has denied having any links to the Al-Qaeda terror network, the
Pentagon said Thursday.


Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, who is the nephew of Khaled Sheikh Mohammed,
told a military commission here last month that he had no ties to
either Al-Qaeda or the Taliban Islamic militants.


"I do not belong to Al-Qaeda, the Taliban or associated
organizations," he said at a hearing at the Guantanamo Bay
detention center to determine his "enemy combatant" status.


Ali, who is accused by the United States of preparing an attack
against the US consulate in the southern Pakistani port of
Karachi when he was arrested in 2003, said he also had no
knowledge of any such plot.


"I did not plan, know about, or carry out any plot against the
United States Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan," he told the
commission on March 30, according to transcripts released
Thursday by the Pentagon.


Ali is one of the 14 terror suspects transfered to the US
military base in Cuba in September after having been held in
secret CIA jails for several years.


His uncle, Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the chief suspect in the
September 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, is
also being held at Guantanamo.


Mohammed has already confessed to carrying out or plotting some
31 attacks or assassinations around the world, including the 2001
attacks on New York and Washington, according to the Pentagon.
