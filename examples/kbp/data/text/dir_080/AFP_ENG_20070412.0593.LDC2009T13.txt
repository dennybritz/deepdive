World number one Annika Sorenstam, who has had an injury-free
13-year career up to this point, has pulled out of the USLPGA
Ginn Open with a back injury.


Sorenstam withdrew from the event Thursday morning with a
ruptured disc in her back, an injury that will sideline the
Swedish star for a month.


Sorenstam was diagnosed with the injury Wednesday afternoon.


The Swede, who is already in the LPGA and World Golf Hall of
Fame, has won 10 majors and earned more than 20 million dollars
in her career.


Sorenstam has a pair of top-10 finishes in three events this
year.
