Eritrea has banned the life-threatening practice of female
circumcision, the Eritrean information ministry said in a
statement.


Anyone who requests, incites or promotes female genital
mutilation (FGM) will be punished with a fine and imprisonment,
said a government statement posted on the Internet late
Wednesday.


"Female circumcision is a procedure that seriously endangers the
health of women, causes them considerable pain and suffering
besides threatening their lives," according to a government
proclamation.


Although opposed by the Eritrean government, FGM is widely
carried out by women in their homes in both Muslim and Christian
communities. Its supporters argue that it helps prevent
promiscuous behaviour.


The ban, which came into force on March 31, follows a campaign by
the National Union of Eritrean Women, which says that 94 percent
of Eritrean women have been circumcised.


The painful and risky practice, which can range from the
stitching up of young girls' vaginas to the excision of the
clitoris, is widespread in many parts of Africa and the Middle
East.
