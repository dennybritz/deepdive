A worried Israel has stalled a US plan to sell advanced weaponry,
including satellite-guided arms, to Saudi Arabia, the New York
Times reported Thursday.


The Times said on its website that Israeli officials, including
former defense minister Shaul Mofaz, have strongly lobbied
Washington in recent months to block parts of a planned arms
package for the Saudis and unspecified others in the Middle East
that could be worth five billion to 10 billion dollars.


Israel is particularly concerned that the United States will
supply the Saudis with precision-guided air-based weapons that
could erode Israel's military superiority in the region, the
newspaper said, citing unnamed US government sources.


"The Israeli complaints have introduced a new uncertainty into
the (US) administration's plan to beef up Persian Gulf militaries
as a bulwark against Iran and as a demonstration that, no matter
what happens in Iraq, Washington remains committed to the Sunni
Arab governments around the region," the Times said.


Israel worries both that closer relations envisioned between
Washington and Israel on one side and Riyadh on the other might
never happen; and that the Saudi regime could give way by
revolution to an Islamic fundamentalist government, it said.
