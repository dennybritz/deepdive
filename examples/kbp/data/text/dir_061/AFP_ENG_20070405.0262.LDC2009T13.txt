Italian police have arrested dozens of Romanians in the last two
months in a crackdown on prostitution, human trafficking and
illegal immigration, the interior ministry said on Thursday.


In an operation involving a hundred police, some 130 people were
arrested in Turin, Bologna, Perugia, Padua and Verona, police
said. Most of them, 102, were Romanian nationals. The others were
either Italian or Albanian.


They are all accused of involvment in pimping, human trafficking
and illegal immigration, according to an official statement which
said that significant quantities of weapons and money had also
been seized during the operation.


An important Italian fugitive and convicted murderer, Antonio
Costantini, was also picked up in the same operation in Romania.


The ministry statement said the joint operation with the Romanian
authorities was possible thanks to a cooperation agreement
between the two countries aimed at tackling cross border crime
that was signed in January.


Italian Interior Minister Guiliano Amato expressed satisfaction
with the operation.


"I am doubly happy because we have, on the one hand, arrested
those responsible for odious crimes, and on the other, we have
shown the efficiency of the cooperation launched several months
ago with the Romanian authorities," Amato said.


The Romanian diaspora in Italy is the largest group of foreigners
in the country. According to one recent study, some 271,000
Romanians live in Italy. Some others suggest the number may be as
high as 400,000.
