Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels shot dead four civilians in eastern
Sri Lanka on Thursday, the defence ministry said, as the military
reported killing three guerrillas.


Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) gunmen opened fire on
farmers in Polonnaruwa district as they travelled to sell their
rice crops, the ministry said.


"It is reported that four villagers have been killed in the
incident," a ministry statement said.


The attack came as the military said they killed three suspected
rebels along the de facto border in northern Sri Lanka after the
air force bombed guerrilla targets in the northeast.


Security forces shot dead three men who tried to infiltrate the
army's defence lines at Muhamalai in the Jaffna peninsula on
Wednesday night, they said.


The shooting came hours after the air force bombed what it called
the main Sea Tiger headquarters of the LTTE, a claim rejected by
the guerrillas.


The LTTE said two civilians were killed and four more were
wounded in the aerial bombardment in Mullaitivu district.


A first air raid hit the "White Pigeon" charity which helps
victims of landmines, the LTTE said, adding that the civilians
died in further aerial bombing in the same area.


The Sri Lankan air force suffered a humiliating blow last week
when Tiger light aircraft bombed its main base next to the
island's only international airport and managed to escape
unchallenged.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005.
