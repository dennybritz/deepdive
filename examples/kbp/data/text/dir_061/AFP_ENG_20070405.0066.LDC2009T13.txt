Online weblogs mushroomed to more than 72 million this year, but
growth of the increasingly divided blogging world slowed, an
Internet search engine company said on Thursday.


Technorati, which tracks the contents of the online personal
journals, said the number around the world surged from eight
million in March 2005 to more than 72 million last month.


But the rate at which the "blogosphere" is doubling has slowed
from once every six months to once a year, said David Sifry,
founder of the San Francisco company.


Technorati said in its "State of the Live Web" report that the
number of daily blog postings climbed from 500,000 in March 2005
to 1.4 million, or 58,000 hourly, in March.


Sifry acknowledged there were probable undercounts in some
countries, such as France, where users of the popular Skyblog
platform do not make it into Technorati's database.


Differences in weblog tools and techniques around the world make
it tough to accurately track growth of the blogosphere, which is
factionalizing based on cultures, according to Global Voices
Online co-founders Ethan Zuckerman and Rebecca MacKinnon.
