Turkey has defeated a bird flu outbreak in the southeast and the
country is now free of the disease, Agriculture Minister Mehdi
Eker said Thursday.


"All quarantine measures are lifted as of today. There is no
problem... and our country is now free of the disease," Eker told
a press conference in Diyarbakir, the largest city of the mainly
Kurdish southeast where the disease emerged in February, the
Anatolia news agency reported.


The virus of the H5N1 strain, potentially deadly to humans,
affected poultry in villages near Diyarbakir and in the
neighboring province of Batman.


Hundreds of birds were culled and several people were tested for
suspected infection, but all results were negative.


A major bird flu outbreak in Turkey killed four teenagers in
January 2006 in a remote region near the border with Iran, from
where the virus quickly spread to more than a half of the
country's 81 provinces.
