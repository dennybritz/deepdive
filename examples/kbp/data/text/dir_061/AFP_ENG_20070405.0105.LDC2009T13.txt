Britain's consul general in Jerusalem was to hold talks with
Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya on Thursday on the fate
of a BBC reporter abducted in Gaza last month, defying an EU
boycott on Hamas ministers.


Richard Makepeace was to meet Haniya in his office in Gaza City
at 1 pm (1000 GMT) to discuss British correspondent Alan
Johnston, whose fate is unknown more than three weeks after his
disappearance.


"The consul general will meet Haniya only to discuss the
abduction of the British reporter. This meeting is strictly for
humanitarian reasons," an official at the consulate said.


Britain and the European Union have refused to meet Hamas members
of the new Palestinian national unity government over the Islamic
group's refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist and renounce
violence.


Johnston is now in his fourth week of captivity after he was
abducted at gunpoint in Gaza City on March 12 -- the longest a
kidnapped foreigner has been kept in the increasingly lawless
territory.
