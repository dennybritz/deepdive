The head of French oil group Total said Thursday he had not been
informed of an investigation by US authorities into the company's
activities in Iran and Iraq.


"I have not received anything (from US authorities)," chief
executive Christophe de Margerie told reporters on the sidelines
of an oil industry conference here.


The Financial Times newspaper, citing unnamed sources, had
reported Tuesday that the US Department of Justice was probing
Total's activities amid suspicions the company may have broken US
laws against overseas bribes.


The sources told the paper the inquiry was at a preliminary stage
and that investigators would seek an informal interview with
Margerie.


The Total boss has already been targeted in French corruption
probes into the Iraq "oil-for-food" bribes scandal and, more
recently, a major gas deal signed by Total in Iran in 1997.


He was put under investigation by a French judge last month after
being detained by police on suspicions of "corruption of foreign
public agents and misuse of corporate assets," a judicial source
told AFP at the time.


Total denies any wrongdoing.
