China's central bank on Thursday ordered major commercial banks
to set aside more money in reserves in an effort to slow its
economy, the third such cooling measure of 2007.


The People's Bank of China said in a statement the action was
designed to enhance bank liquidity management and prevent
excessively fast credit growth.


It said the required deposit reserve ratio for most commercial
lenders would on April 16 rise 0.5 percentage point to 10.5
percent.


The required deposit ratio was raised a similar 0.5 percentage
point in January and February this year and three times in 2006.


Last month, the benchmark one-year lending rate was raised by
0.27 percentage point.


China's economy, the world's fourth largest, expanded by 10.7
percent in 2006 and is likely to grow by 10 percent in 2007, the
central bank said last week.
