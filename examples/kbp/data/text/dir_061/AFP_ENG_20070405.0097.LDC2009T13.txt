Some 30 people were slightly injured on Thursday when a suburban
train hit a rail buffer as it pulled into a Paris station, police
said.


A spokesman for the state-owned rail company SNCF said the
passengers suffered "a few bruises" when the train came to a
sudden halt as it arrived at the Gare de l'Est station in the
morning rush-hour.


"It's not an accident, but an incident, which happens from time
to time," said the spokesman, saying the train had "hit the
buffer a bit roughly."
