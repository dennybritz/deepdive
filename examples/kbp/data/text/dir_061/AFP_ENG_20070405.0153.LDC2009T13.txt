A roadside bomb blast killed four British soldiers and a civilian
translator on Thursday near the southern Iraqi city of Basra, a
military spokesman told AFP.


"Four soldiers and a civilian interpretor were killed in a
roadside bomb attack early this morning," Lieutenant Colonel
Kevin Stratford-Wright said.


"It was against a multinational force warrior patrol. All of the
soldiers were part of the British contingent," he added.
