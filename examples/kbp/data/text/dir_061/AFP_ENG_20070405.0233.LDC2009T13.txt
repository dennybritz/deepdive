The Belgian chemicals group Solvay plans to build a new
production unit in Thailand in order to tap into growing Asian
demand for a widely used compound, the company said Thursday.


The company, which makes plastics and drugs as well as chemicals,
aims to have the plant up and running by 2009, with plans to
produce 100,000 tonnes of a compound made using by-products from
the bio-diesel industry.


The chemical building block, epichlorohydrin, is used in the car,
housing and boating industries as well as for reinforcing paper
products such as tea bags and water purification.


Solvay, which already has a plant at Map Ta Phut on the Gulf of
Thailand, said it wanted to build the new plant "in response to
rapidly growing demand for epichlorohydrin, in particular in
Asia."


Brussels-based Solvay booked sales in 2006 of 9.4 billion euros
(12.6 billion dollars) and employs 29,000 people in 50 countries.
