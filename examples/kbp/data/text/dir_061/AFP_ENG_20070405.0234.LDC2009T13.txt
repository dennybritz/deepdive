Prime Minister Tony Blair "rejoiced" Thursday at the return of 15
British sailors from Iran, but lamented the deaths of four
soldiers in Iraq which showed the "ugly reality" of terrorism in
the region.


"Just as we rejoice at the return of our 15 personnel, so today
we also grieve and mourn for the loss of our soldiers in Basra
who were killed as a result of a terrorist act," he said.
