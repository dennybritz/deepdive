Japan's government on Thursday appointed a former top manager at
Japan's largest trading company and a former shipping company
executive to the Bank of Japan's monetary policy board.


Former Mitsubishi Corp. vice president Hidetoshi Kamezaki, 64,
and former MOL Ferry Co. president Seiji Nakamura, 64, join the
central bank for five-year terms as it faces the tricky task of
judging when to raise interest rates again in the face of still-
subdued inflation.


They replace Hidehiko Haru and Toshikatsu Fukuma, who also came
from business backgrounds and whose terms on the nine-member
rate-setting board have just expired, the BoJ said.


Kamezaki has experience in international business at Mitsubishi,
while Nakamura rose through the ranks of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.
where he dealt mainly with accounting.


The new board members will hold a news conference next Wednesday,
following the central bank's two-day monetary policy meeting
through Tuesday.


Market participants will pay close attention to the news
conference as it is still unclear what the pair's views are on
the need for further interest rates rises, analysts said.


In February, the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rates by a
quarter-point to 0.5 percent, the first increase since last July
when it ended its highly unorthodox policy of virtually free
credit.


BoJ governor Toshihiko Fukui has said he hopes to raise interest
rates gradually but he faces political resistance to further
monetary tightening.
