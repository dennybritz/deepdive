Sri Lankan security forces on Thursday found a powerful landmine
in a shop along the main road to the island's only international
airport, police said.


The "Claymore" mine, a type frequently used for roadside attacks,
was found at a shop in Wattala, just outside the capital and
along the main highway to Bandaranaike international airport, a
police official said.


"The Claymore was found following a tip off," the spokesman said.
"It was hidden and not ready to be exploded. We have taken into
custody five people after the bomb was found."


The discovery was made as President Mahinda Rajapakse returned to
the island early Thursday after attending a South Asian summit in
New Delhi.


However the president travelled to the city, a distance of 35
kilometres (20 miles), by helicopter, a spokesman for the
president's office said.


Last week, Tamil Tiger rebels flew light aircraft and bombed the
country's main air base located adjoining the international
airport and escaped unchallenged.


Security has been intensified in Colombo to counter possible
attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) amid
stepped up violence in the island's embattled northern and
eastern regions.


Over 60,000 people have since been killed in the Tamil separatist
conflict and diplomatic attempts to bring the warring factions to
the negotiating table have ended in failure.
