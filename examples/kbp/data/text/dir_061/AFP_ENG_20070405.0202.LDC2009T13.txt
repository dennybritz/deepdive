EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana has held fresh talks with
Iran's nuclear envoy aimed at reviving negotiations on the
Islamic republic's atomic programme, an EU official said
Thursday.


Solana, who has been charged by the five permanent UN Security
Council members plus Germany with trying to entice Tehran back to
the table, held telephone talks with Ari Larijani on Wednesday,
the official said.


"There was a conversation yesterday," he said, on condition of
anonymity. "They agreed to keep in contact, but only by telephone
for now."


The aim of the talks is to try to find common ground to resume
the negotiations on the basis of a previous offer made by the
international community, the official explained.


The offer includes political, economic and trade incentives for
Iran to give up uranium enrichment, which is necessary to produce
nuclear energy but can be used to make an atomic bomb at highly
refined levels.


Western countries fear that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear
weapon covertly under the guise of a civilian energy programme.


Iran says it simply wants to generate electricity and has refused
to suspend enrichment as a precondition for the talks to begin.


The EU official refused to provide further details about
Wednesday's telephone conversation, except to say that it took
place before the release of 15 British sailors, who were being
held by Iran.
