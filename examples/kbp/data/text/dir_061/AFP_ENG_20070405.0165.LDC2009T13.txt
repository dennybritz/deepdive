A Spanish activist campaigning for transsexual rights said she
had become the first person in the Spanish capital to request a
legal change of name and sex under new laws passed last month.


Under the new law Carla Antonelli, who was born a man, can
request a change to her name and sex on official documents
without having to undergo a sex change operation.


On her website, Antonelli said she had "the honour" to be the
first to formally request a change of status in Madrid where she
has lived for the last 25 years.


To qualify for the change Antonelli will have to show that she
has been following medically-supervised hormonal treatments for
at least two years to prepare her for taking on the
characteristics of her new sexual identity.


Antonelli, now 47, changed her appearance when she was 17 years
old, at a time under Franco when being a transsexual was
punishable by a prison term.


Prior to the new law, would-be transsexuals could only change
their identity and civil status on official documents after
undergoing a sex change.


The Spanish endocrinological society puts the number of
transsexuals in the country at 3,000, but associations who
represent them put the figure as high as 9,000.


Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's Socialists
have already pushed through a raft of liberal social policies,
including the 2005 authorisation of same-sex "marriages" and
adoption by homosexuals.
