Barcelona and several other major European clubs are interested
in signing Arsenal captain Thierry Henry, the Spanish sports
daily El Mundo Deportivo reported here Thursday.


The French international striker, sidelined due to injury until
the end of the season, has apparently fallen out with Arsenal
coach Arsene Wenger and is no longer considered untransferable,
commented the Barcelona-based newspaper.


The newspaper added that his representatives have begun "discreet
contacts" with European clubs with a view to securing a transfer
from the Emirates Stadium.


Inter Milan and AC Milan are also among the clubs which are
reported to be


interested in signing the 29-year-old player, despite Henry
insisting only three weeks ago that he wanted to stay at Arsenal
for the rest of his career.


Barcelona's interest in Henry is nothing new.


He was widely linked with the Catalan club at the end of last
season while negotiating a new contract with Arsenal.


However, the fact that he is perceived to have reneged on his
verbal promise to move to Spain by some Barcelona club directors
could ultimately mitigate against Barca making a serious bid,
added El Mundo Deportivo.


The big question has always been, if Barcelona were to sign him,
where would he fit into a side that won the Spanish title and the
Champions League last season and is on course to clinch its third
successive La Liga crown?


Henry suffered groin and stomach injuries during Arsenal's
Champions League exit against PSV Eindhoven in March and has
still not return to playing.
