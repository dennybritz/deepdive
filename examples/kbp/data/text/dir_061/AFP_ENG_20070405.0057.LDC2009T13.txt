Iran's reformist and conservative press applauded on Thursday the
surprise release of 15 British sailors, boasting that Tehran had
won a commitment from Britain for their freedom.


All Iranian newspapers printed front-page pictures of the 14 men
and one woman waving to the cameras at the presidential compound
after their pardon by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.


"With a written commitment from Britain and on the threshold of
the prophet of compassion's birthday (Mohammed), Iran pardons the
intruding sailors," the hardline Kayhan said in its headline.


This appeared to be a reference to Ahmadinejad's statement that
the British government vowed in a letter not to repeat such
incidents, something that has not been confirmed by London.


"Britain gave guarantees, the military were freed," said Jaam-
Jam, the newspaper of Iran's state broadcaster.


In an editorial titled: "The message of freedom, the humiliation
of the powers", it said: "Their freedom had two clear messages.


"The first showed Iran's might in confronting any aggression and
intrusion. The second message was prevention of international
tension between Iran and the rest of countries."


The reformist Aftab Yazd published an editorial on the day's
events entitled "I did feel proud."


"The president should have added another clause to his release
statement and that was 'we wanted to release them earlier but we
wanted the 48 hours ultimatum of Blair to pass before we released
them," it addeed.


British Prime Minister had announced on Tuesday that the next 48
hours would be "critical" in the standoff.
