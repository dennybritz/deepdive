Hundreds of porters and dozens of horses will help transport
ballot boxes to remote and mountainous regions of East Timor in
Monday's presidential election, the United Nations said Thursday.


Finn Reske-Nielsen, deputy head of the UN mission in East Timor,
said four helicopters will be used to reach distant areas and
those with no road access. He said 400 porters and 90 horses will
also help in the logistics effort.


Monday's vote is the first for president since the impoverished
former Portuguese colony achieved independence in 2002 after 24
years of Indonesian occupation and a period of UN stewardship.


There will be more than 700 polling stations, monitored by 200
East Timorese observers and 232 from abroad, Reske-Nielsen told
reporters.
