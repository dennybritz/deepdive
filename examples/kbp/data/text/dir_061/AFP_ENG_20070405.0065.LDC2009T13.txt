Takao Suzuki will lead Japan's Davis Cup squad against Thailand,
who will be without their ace Paradorn Srichaphan, in the Asia-
Oceania Group One second round tie which kicks off Friday.


Paradorn, Asia's best known player, suffered a right wrist injury
in Florida last month, meaning he will be sidelined along with
countryman Danai Odomchoke, the gold medallist at last year's
Asian Games in Doha.


Japan's Go Soeda will take on Kittipong Wachiramanowong in the
opening singles rubber on the indoor court at the Namihaya Dome.


Suzuki will play Weerapat Doakmaiklee in the second singles match
before teaming up with Satoshi Iwabuchi on Saturday for a doubles
match against twin brothers Sonchat and Sanchai Ratiwatana.


The winning side will advance to a play-off for a place in the
World Group next year.


Japan have five wins and two defeats against Thailand in the
Davis Cup series since their first encounter in 1958.
