Britain's manufactured output unexpectedly dropped by 0.6 percent
in February from the January figure, marking the strongest
decline since October 2005, official data showed on Thursday.


Analysts' consensus forecast had been for an output rise in
February of 0.3 percent.


On a 12-month basis, manufactured output climbed 1.2 percent in
February, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, below
market expectations of a 2.2-percent increase.


Twelve of the 13 sub-sectors showed decreases in output between
February and January.


"Within the widespread falls seen on the month there was a
significant decrease in the transport equipment industries where
output fell by 1.3 percent," the ONS said.
