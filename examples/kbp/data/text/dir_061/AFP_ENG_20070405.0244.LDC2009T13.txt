The 15 British detainees held in Iran for two weeks emerged from
the plane which brought them home from Tehran Thursday, back in
their navy uniforms and some of them joking together.


They lined up for a group picture beside the British Airways jet
which brought them back to London, before boarding Sea King
helicopters to take them to a military base in southwest England.


In Tehran they had been pictured wearing ill-fitting suits
apparently given to them by Iranian authorities, after their
unexpected release was announced on Wednesday.
