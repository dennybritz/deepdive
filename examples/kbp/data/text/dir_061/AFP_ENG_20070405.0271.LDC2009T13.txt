The US military confirmed an army helicopter crashed south of
Baghdad on Thursday and said four personnel had been wounded.


"A US Army helicopter went down south of Baghdad Thursday. There
were nine personnel on board including passengers and crew. Four
personnel were injured and have been evacuated," a statement
said.


The incident was under investigation, it added without providing
any further details on the cause of the crash.


Unconfirmed reports earlier suggested that a Black Hawk went down
near the Sunni Arab insurgent stronghold of Latifiyah, 40
kilometres (25 miles) south of Baghdad, after coming under ground
fire.


Ten US helicopters -- including two operated by private security
firms --  have now come down in Iraq since January 20, most of
them to hostile fire.
