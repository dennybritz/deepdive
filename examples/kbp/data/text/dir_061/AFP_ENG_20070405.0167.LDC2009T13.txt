A roadside bomb blast killed four British soldiers and a civilian
translator on Thursday near the southern Iraqi city of Basra, a
military spokesman told AFP.


"Four soldiers and a civilian interpretor were killed in a
roadside bomb attack early this morning," Lieutenant Colonel
Kevin Stratford-Wright said.


"It was against a multinational force Warrior patrol. All of the
soldiers were part of the British contingent," he added.


The patrol was earlier attacked by five gunmen in a different
area, although that assault was repelled and at least one of the
attackers hit in a return of fire, the spokesman said.


After the unit left the urban area, west of Basra, it was
attacked by a roadside bomb, followed by small-arms fire and
rocket-propelled grenades, Stratford- Wright said.


"During that attack the five people were killed, all of whom were
in the same vehicle. A further soldier who was in the vehicle is
very seriously wounded," he said.


Troops had returned fire from the Warrior vehicles but could not
confirm whether the attackers had been hit.


Thursday's deaths bring to 140 the number of British soldiers
killed in Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003.
