The US military was investigating reports that one of its
helicopters was shot down early Thursday south of Baghdad, a
spokesman said.


"We are checking reports about a helicopter crash," the spokesman
told AFP without giving details.


Unconfirmed reports suggested that a Black Hawk went down near
the Sunni Arab insurgent stronghold of Latifiyah, south of
Baghdad, after it received ground fire.


Nine US helicopters -- including two operated by private security
firms -- have come down in Iraq since January 20, most of them to
hostile fire.
