Chinese share prices shrugged off early profit-taking pressure
and set another record Thursday, adding 0.84 percent on continued
fund inflows, with financial plays and property developers in
focus, dealers said.


The latest gains mean the Shanghai Composite index has risen for
13 of the last 14 days, chalking up successive record highs at
the same time.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, rose 27.60 points to 3,319.14 on turnover of 114.50
billion yuan (14.77 billion dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 28.85 points or 0.83 percent to
3,488.36 on turnover of 113.86 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index added 13.02 points or 1.44 percent at 916.10,
another record, on turnover of 56.88 billion yuan.
