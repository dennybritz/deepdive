Arnold Palmer made his debut as the Masters ceremonial starter
here Thursday, smashing his ball off the first tee to open the
71st edition of the famed event at Augusta National Golf Club.


Palmer's ball found the left edge of the fairway and a spectator
picked it up and tried to take it as a keepsake before an Augusta
National employee made them surrender the prized souvenir.


Palmer revived a tradition of honorary starters that had not been
seen at Augusta National since 2002, when Sam Snead served the
role a month before his death.


The 77-year-old US golf legend, a four-time Masters champion who
played in a record 50 consecutive Masters, announced Tuesday that
he would serve in the role. Palmer, who last made the cut in
1983, played for the final time in 2004.


Palmer won 62 US PGA titles, including Masters crowns in 1958,
1960, 1962 and 1964.


Honorary starters began at the Masters in 1963 with Jock
Hutchison and Fred McLeod doing the honors. Byron Nelson, Gene
Sarazen and Snead followed multiple times.
