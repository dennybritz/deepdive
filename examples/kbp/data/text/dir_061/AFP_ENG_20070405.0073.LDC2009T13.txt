At least eight children were killed and 14 wounded on Thursday
when a speeding tractor smashed into a school in a rural
Pakistani town, police said.


The driver lost control and struck a roadside government primary
school in Hafizabad, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) southeast of
Lahore, the capital of Punjab province.


"Seven children died on the spot and one died on his way to
hospital," local hospital chief Mohammad Aslam told AFP. Most of
those hurt suffered fractures and head injuries.


"The tractor hit the wall of the school, making it collapse onto
the children during a class. Scores of children were taking
lessons in the school when the accident occured," area police
chief Waqar Abbasi said.


"We have arrested the reckless driver and legal action will be
taken against him," Abbasi said.


Pakistan has the world's third highest death rate from road
accidents. Vehicles are often overloaded and poorly maintained
while many roads are treacherous.
