The 15 million population of India's capital enjoyed a day off
Thursday for municipal elections seen as a trial of strength
between the ruling Congress and Hindu nationalists.


Shops, businesses, schools and banks closed for the ballot in the
272 constituencies of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).


The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is battling to win
control from the Congress Party of a city grappling with a series
of issues from inadequate infrastructure to power shortages.


The Congress swept federal parliamentary elections in 2004 and
went on to wrest control of the New Delhi state assembly and the
municipal council from the nationalists.


The municipal polls are seen as a stepping stone for politicians
aspiring to enter the 543-seat national parliament.


Election officials said 2,575 hopefuls including 1,261
independent candidates were in the fray.


With 10 million voters, 60,000 police officers and federal troops
were deployed at 9,649 polling booths. Security was also
reinforced in 307 "violence-prone" constituencies.


The Delhi High Court appointed a retired judge as a poll observer
to try to prevent fraud.
