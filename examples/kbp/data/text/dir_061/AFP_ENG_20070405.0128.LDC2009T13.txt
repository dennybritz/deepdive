Hiking trails on a scenic mountain next to the South Korean
presidential palace reopened Thursday after being closed for
nearly 40 years following an infiltration attempt by North Korean
commandos.


"Mount Bukak is now returned to ordinary citizens in accordance
with President Roh Moo-Hyun's policy of openness," his office
said in a statement after Roh and hundreds of others took part in
a reopening ceremony.


An improvement in inter-Korean relations was another important
motive behind the decision to grant access to Mount Bukak, Roh
said at the ceremony.


People who want to go hiking on the 342-metre (1,129 foot) peak
will have to register with authorities at least a week in advance
and take special guides.


The mountain was closed after about 30 North Korean commandos
crossed it en route to the presidential palace in a bid to kill
then-president Park Chung-Hee in 1968.


Most died in a firefight a few hundred metres from the
presidential palace.


North Korea's last known attempt at armed infiltration was a
submarine incursion in September 1996.


Twenty-four attackers were killed or committed suicide and one
was captured.
