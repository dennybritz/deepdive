Provisional results of Benin's parliamentary elections held on
the weekend will be released on Friday "at the latest", the
country's electoral commission said on Thursday.


Counting is underway and the last of the local electoral
commissions are in the process of sending in their results, a
spokesman for the Independent National Electoral Commission said.


Saturday's legislative election is being viewed as a political
yardstick for President Boni Yayi a year after he took office
pledging to fight corruption.


Yayi, a former development banker and a virtual political unknown
was the surprise winner of the presidential poll in March last
year.


Some 20 parties backing Yayi grouped together to fight the
election under the Cauri Forces for an Emerging Benin (FCBE)
banner.


FCBE candidates are up against both the Democratic Renewal party
(PRD), loyal to Adrien Houngbedji, the defeated candidate in last
March's presidential election, and another grouping known as the
Alliance for Dynamism and Democracy (ADD).
