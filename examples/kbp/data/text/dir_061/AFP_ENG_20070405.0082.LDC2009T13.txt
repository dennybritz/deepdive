The group of 15 British naval personnel are to be taken to a
"secure location" for a debrief on their time in Iranian
captivity in Iran when they land on home soil Wednesday.


"The plane will be landing and then they will be whisked into a
helicopter and taken to a secure location. I don't know where," a
spokesman for the British Airports Authority (BAA) told AFP.


A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said there would be no
press conference at Heathrow airport, west of London, where their
British Airways flight is due to land at terminal four at 12:05
pm (1105 GMT).


It is understood that they will then be taken from there to a
location in the countryside, reportedly a base in Devon,
southwest England, to undergo a debrief.


Plymouth, the county's biggest town, is the home port of HMS
Cornwall, the ship which the crew were serving on when they were
captured.


The MoD spokesman said he did not know if the group would be
reunited with the families at the airport or at a later stage.


The group is currently flying home from Tehran, 14 days after
they were seized by Iran, which accused them of violating the
country's territorial waters.


They were released following a surprise announcement by Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at a press conference Wednesday
that they would be given their liberty "as a gift to the British
people".
