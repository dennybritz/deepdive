British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday that no deal had
been struck to secure the release of 15 sailors and marines
detained for nearly two weeks in Iran.


They were freed "without any deal, without any negotiation,
without any side agreement of any nature whatever," he said
outside his 10 Downing Street office at the exact moment the
detainees touched down at London's Heathrow airport.


Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed Wednesday that
Britain had promised in a letter not to repeat what Tehran says
was an incursion into its territorial waters which prompted their
detention.


While Blair said he "rejoiced" at the return of the sailors and
marines, he also used his statement to deplore the death of four
British soldiers in Iraq, announced moments before the captives'
return.


This showed the "ugly reality" of terrorism in Iraq, Blair said,
adding that "elements" of the Iranian regime were backing
terrorism in Iraq.


"Just as we rejoice at the return of our 15 personnel, so today
we also grieve and mourn for the loss of our soldiers in Basra
who were killed as a result of a terrorist act," he said.


He added that while the crisis had opened up "new and
interesting" lines of communication between Britain and Iran, the
international community must remain "absolutely steadfast" in
enforcing its will on Iran, referring to its disputed nuclear
programme and alleged support for terrorism.
