Early results from a poorly-attended referendum on Madagascar's
constitution showed the president set to win increased powers and
English to become an official language of the former French
colony.


Partial results from the capital Antananarivo, where turnout was
only 30.3 percent, showed 65.45 percent of voters had endorsed
the text, the interior ministry said on Thursday.


Full results from the rest of the country were due within three
days, with President Marc Ravalomanana, who won a second term in
elections in December, expected to see his project endorsed.


Proposed revisions to the text include eliminating the autonomy
of six provinces and making English an official language,
alongside French and Malagasy.


The opposition claims the main aim of the text is to give more
powers to the president. The new constitution contains a clause
permitting the head of state to legislate by decree in emergency
situations.


Heavy rains sparked by a tropical cyclone marred Wednesday's
vote, in which some seven million voters, out of a population of
around 18 million, were eligible to take part.


Madagascar's constitution dates back to its independence from
France in 1960 and was last revised in 1998.


Nearly 70 percent of the population of the Indian Ocean nation
live in abject poverty.
