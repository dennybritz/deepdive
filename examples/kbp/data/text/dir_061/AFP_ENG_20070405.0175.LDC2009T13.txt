Italian telecoms giant Telecom Italia was in crisis mode
Thursday, shaken by strains between its main shareholders amid
efforts to prevent a takeover by US operator ATT.


Telecom Italia chairman Guido Rossi was off the list presented by
Italian group Pirelli, which controls 18 percent of Telecom
Italia, for the next board of directors to be selected on April
16, sparking an open battle among shareholders.


Business bank Mediobanca and insurer Generali, two kingpins of
Italian capitalism, fiercely denounced the lack of consultation
with Pirelli called for in a pact linking the three groups.


The two camps clashed openly in statements issued overnight
Wednesday, with Pirelli claiming to be acting within its rights
while Mediobanca and Generali demanded an urgent meeting of the
shareholders' pact.


Generali holds 1.54 percent of Telecom Italia, and Mediobanca
3.67 percent.


Rossi, now in open conflit with Pirelli chairman Marco Tronchetti
Provera -- who promoted him for the chairmanship in September
2006 -- is talking about stepping down before the April 16
meeting.


"I'm thinking of quitting. I will study all the options in the
interest of the parties involved," he told the daily La
Repubblica.


Shares in Telecom Italia leapt in midday trade Wednesday on
reports that German counterpart Deutsche Telekom might join in
the bid, dealers said.


Pirelli is in exclusive talks to sell the stake owned by its
Olimpia unit in Telecom Italia to ATT and its Mexican affiliate
America Movil, with negotiations based on a price per Telecom
Italia share of 2.82 euros minus Olimpia's net debt.
