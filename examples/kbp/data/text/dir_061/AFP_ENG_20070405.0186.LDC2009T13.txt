Six more American soldiers have been killed in and outside
Baghdad, where Iraqi and US forces are pressing a massive
security crackdown into an eighth week, the military announced on
Thursday.


Two soldiers were killed and another three wounded when a
roadside bomb attack ripped through their combat patrol in a
southern part of Baghdad on Wednesday, the military said.


Another two soldiers died and a third was wounded in a separate
roadside bomb attack north of the Iraqi capital on Wednesday,
another statement said.


One more soldier died when a patrol was attacked with small-arms
fire in an eastern section of Baghdad on the same day.


Insurgents also shot dead a sixth soldier during a routine patrol
in an eastern district of the Iraqi capital on Tuesday, a
separate statement said.


The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 2,361, according to an AFP tally based
on Pentagon figures.
