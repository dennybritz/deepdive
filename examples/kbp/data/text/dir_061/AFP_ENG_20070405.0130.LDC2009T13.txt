A former senior executive of French fashion house Christian Dior
in Japan was indicted Thursday for smuggling cocaine and
possessing cannabis, police said.


Guillaume Monnier, who has left as vice president of Christian
Dior KK, was arrested last month after he allegedly sent 8.8
grams (0.31 ounces) of cocaine in a package from France to his
Tokyo address.


Police said they later found cannabis at the 37-year-old
Frenchman's home and arrested him and his wife on the spot.


"He was indicted today over charges of both smuggling cocaine and
possessing cannabis," a Tokyo police officer said.


Police decided not to charge Monnier's wife over the cannabis.
But the 27-year- old Frenchwoman was re-arrested on a separate
count of possessing MDMA, which is more widely known as ecstasy,
he said.


"It was a small piece of MDMA," the officer told AFP on customary
condition of anonymity, adding she was still held in custody.


"It was found in the search of their house and sent to the
laboratory, which delayed her arrest over the other drug," he
said.


Japan strictly enforces laws against both drug trafficking and
consumption, including cannabis, which can lead to prison terms.


Tokyo customs discovered the cocaine hidden in the international
package, leading to the search of Monnier's house on March 16.


Monnier admitted to hiding the cocaine but not to the possession
of cannabis, saying it may have been left at his house by
friends, according to police.


Christian Dior KK has called the arrest a personal matter for
Monnier and said he has left his position as vice president of
general merchandising, marketing and communication.
