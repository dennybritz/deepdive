Valencia's Vicente Rodriguez will miss next week's Champions
League quarter- final second leg against Chelsea with a torn left
hamstring, the club confirmed here Thursday.


The Spanish international midfield playmaker limped off clutching
his leg after 57 minutes of Wednesday's first leg which ended 1-1
at Stamford Bridge.


The second act of the finely balanced last eight tie is in
Valencia next Tuesday.


Club medical officials said that Vicente would be out of action
for at least a month.


"Vicente will be lost to us for a long time. It's frustrating
becuase he gives us a touch of quality. He can change the course
of a game and when he's not there we are not the same," said
Valencia coach Quique Flores on Thursday.


"Now we have a lot of people injured but we can't cry about it,"
added Flores.


In addition to their ambitions of making the Champions League
final for the third time in their history, following on from
their back-to-back losses in 2000 and 2001, Valencia currently
lie fourth in the Spanish first division.


They have a difficult programme immediately ahead of them and
play both second- placed Sevilla and third-placed Real Madrid, as
well as Chelsea, in the next three weeks.
