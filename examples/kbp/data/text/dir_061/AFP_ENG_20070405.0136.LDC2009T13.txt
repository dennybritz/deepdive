Finnish telecommunications equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday
it had paid Qualcomm 20 million dollars for patent licences
covering the second quarter of 2007.


In a statement issued as the two groups try to thrash out a new
technology- licensing agreement Nokia said the US maker of chips
for mobile phones can expect to receive similar payments in the
future.


Nokia said the payment was "fair and reasonable compensation" for
certain patents used in Nokia handsets based on Universal Mobile
Telecommunication System (UMTS), the 3G mobile phone technology.


Qualcomm pioneered the introduction of specialist technology
which lays the groundwork for the current third-generation mobile
technology standard.


The pair have been locked in battle for some time over Nokia's
use of Qualcomm's patents.


Last June the US firm sued Nokia alleging the Finnish company had
engaged in "unfair trade practices" by selling handsets and
components that infringe on up to six of its patents.


Earlier this week, Qualcomm laid fresh charges in the US against
Nokia.


On Thursday Nokia's Chief financial officer, Rick Simonson,
warned Qualcomm that it would defend itself against further
claims over the patents.


"It is important to note that as of April 9, 2007, Qualcomm's
entire chipset business becomes exposed to Nokia's extensive GSM,
WCDMA and CDMA patent portfolios and Nokia will use all rights
from those portfolios when defending itself against any new
Qualcomm litigation," he said.
