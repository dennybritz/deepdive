The 15 British sailors and marines held in Iran for nearly two
weeks arrived back in London Thursday, after being released by
Tehran as a "gift" to Britain.


The British Airways flight carrying the group from Tehran touched
down at London's Heathrow Airport shortly after midday (1100
GMT.)


After their arrival the eight sailors and seven marines were to
be ferried in Sea King helicopters to RAF Chivenor miltary base
in Devon, southwest England, to be reunited with families.
