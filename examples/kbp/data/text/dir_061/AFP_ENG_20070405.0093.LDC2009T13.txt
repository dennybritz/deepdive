Iraqi and US forces have arrested two suspects in connection with
a suicide truck bombing in northern Iraq last week that triggered
brutal sectarian reprisals, the US military said Thursday.


On March 27, a suicide bomber blew up a truck packed with flour
and explosives amid a crowd of Shiites in the town of Tal Afar,
killing more than 100 people and wounding nearly 200.


The town's mayor, Najim Abdallah, said at least 107 people were
killed in the attack, although Iraq's interior ministry
maintained that 152 people were slaughtered.


After the bombing, a group of armed men, most of them suspected
Shiite policemen, went on a rampage killing 56 Sunni Arabs in the
town within hours.


On Thursday, the US military said two suspects had been arrested
in connection with carrying out the truck bombing.


"Iraqi security forces conducted a raid on April 3 in Nineveh
province, detaining two suspects," the military statement said.


"The two are alleged to be responsible for the recent vehicle
borne improvised explosive device attacks on the people of Tal
Afar as well as attacks on coalition and Iraqi forces."


Security forces, which included US troops, raided a house
northwest of Tal Afar and captured the two "primary targets", it
said.


Another 19 "suspicious individuals" were also detained during the
raid, the military added.
