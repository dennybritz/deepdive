Iraq's radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr sacked two lawmakers
from his political group for meeting US administrators without
his knowledge, the cleric's office said.


"The order to replace the two has been given directly by Moqtada
al-Sadr," his office in the Shiite holy city of Najaf said on
Wednesday, identifying them as Salam al-Maliki and Qusai Abdel
Wahab.


The Americans believe the firebrand anti-US cleric is now in
exile in Tehran but his office denies that, saying he is still in
Iraq.


Maliki was transport minister in the previous Iraqi government.


Sadr's office said the two MPs will be replaced under recent
legislation enabling political blocs to switch their lawmakers
serving in parliament.


Sadr's group has 32 MPs in the 275-member national assembly and
six ministers in Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's coalition
government.


Sadr is one of the chief opponents to US troops in Iraq and
launched two bloody rebellions against US troops in 2004, before
joining the political process and ultimately becoming a strong
ally of the prime minister.


The US military accuses his militia, the Mahdi Army, of leading
the sectarian warfare in Iraq by killing members of Sunni Arab
community.
