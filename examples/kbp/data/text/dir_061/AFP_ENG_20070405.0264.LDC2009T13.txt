Unemployment in Lithuania fell to 3.7 percent of the workforce in
March compared with the previous month, the national labour
bureau said Thursday.


Unemployment dropped from 3.9 percent in February, a rate which
had held steady for two months after jobless figures increased at
the end of last year.


Compared with March 2006, unemployment also fell last month by
0.2 percentage points, the bureau said.


A total of 78,500 people were registered as unemployed on April 1
in the Baltic state, which joined the European Union in 2004.
