A French fighter jet crashed on Thursday during a reconnaissance
mission in northern Chad, the French defence ministry said.


The pilot of the Mirage F-1 jet was able to eject from the
aircraft before the crash, and was recovered "safe and well",
according to a defence ministry statement, adding that no damage
nor injuries was caused on the ground.


The crash occurred at around 0820 GMT for "an undetermined
accidental reason", the statement said.


Around 1,100 French troops are stationed in the former French
colony, where they are providomg logistical back-up to the regime
of President Idriss Deby Itno against hostile rebel groups
operating in the country's east.
