The board of Swiss reinsurer Converium on Thursday urged
shareholders to wait for its decision regarding a takeover offer
by French rival Scor, after the latter published details of its
bid in the Swiss press.


"The board of directors will make its recommendation regarding
the offer and state its reasons for such position within the time
legally required after the commencement of the tender offer,"
Converium said in a statement.


Until now, Converium's board has opposed Scor's bid.


Scor is offering 0.5 of its own shares and four Swiss francs in
cash, for each individual Converium share.


The French group already holds 32.9 percent of its Swiss peer.
