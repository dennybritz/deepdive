Airbus said on Thursday it has decided to further increase the
production rate of its A330/A340 family of aircraft from the
current monthly output of seven to nine in 2009.


In a newsletter, the group said it was raising production "in
response to market demand for this Airbus widebody family which
continues to be strong, with 1,080 total orders and a healthy
backlog of 279 aircraft".


Separately, Airbus also said it received 44 firm orders for
aircraft in February and March, including 35 for A320 aircraft,
two for A350XWBs and seven for A330/A340s.


It also acquired three new customers - Petters Group Worldwide,
the Royal Air Force of Oman and a private customer in Asia.


Airbus, which is owned by European aerospace and defence giant
EADS, is mired in a crisis caused by delays to its A380
superjumbo programme, seen as critical to Airbus' bid to catch up
with US rival Boeing.


Under its Power8 restructuring plan, the group plans to shed
10,000 jobs across Europe to save five billion euros (6.6 billion
dollars) by 2010.
