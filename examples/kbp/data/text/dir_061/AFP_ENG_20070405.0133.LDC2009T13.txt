Thailand's army-installed premier Surayud Chulanont had an
audience Thursday with Japan's Emperor Akihito, capping his first
visit to a Group of Eight nation since last year's coup.


The Thai premier and his wife, Khunying Chitravadee, held a
courtesy meeting with the emperor and Empress Michiko at the
palace in central Tokyo, an Imperial Household Agency spokesman
said.


Surayud then left Tokyo, closing a four-day visit in which he
pocketed a free- trade deal with Japan, the top investor in the
kingdom, an airport official said.


The deal, which triggered street protests in Bangkok by anti-
globalisation activists, scraps tariffs on 97 percent of Japanese
exports to Thailand and 92 percent of Thai exports to Japan
within 10 years.


The agreement was originally negotiated by Thailand's business-
friendly prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by the
army in September.


Surayud has yet to visit any Western nations, which were largely
critical of the military's takeover last year.


But Japan has longstanding political and economic ties with
Thailand.


Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visited Thailand in June last
year for celebrations marking revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej's
60th year on the throne.
