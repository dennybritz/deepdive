Iran "achieved its objectives" in the crisis over the 15 British
sailors, the foreign policy advisor to supreme leader Ali
Khamenei said Thursday.


He also said Britain had sent a letter of apology to Iran the day
before President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced the release of the
15, who arrived back in Britain on Thursday.


"The Islamic Republic of Iran showed that it will defend its
territorial integrity and has no fear," said Ali Akbar Velayati,
a hugely influential former foreign minister.


"It achieved its objectives in pardoning the British sailors," he
was quoted as saying by state television.


He denied that a statement by British Prime Minister Tony Blair
earlier this week that the next 48 hours were "critical" in the
standoff had anything to do with the surprise release on
Wednesday.


"Iran set a condition that Britain accepts there was a violation
(of Iranian waters) and gives apologies. The day before the
release (Tuesday) the prime minister sent a letter of apology,"
he added.
