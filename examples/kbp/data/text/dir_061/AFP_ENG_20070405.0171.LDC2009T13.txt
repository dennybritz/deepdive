Two people were killed Thursday when their helicopter crashed
into a house in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg, paramedics
said.


"It appears the chopper crashed into a tree and went down into a
garden of a house. Two people flying the private helicopter died
on the scene," Werner Vermaak, a spokesman for the emergency
rescue service ER24, told AFP.


He said the two people inside the house, in the suburb of
Sandton, heard a loud bang and then found the helicopter crashed
in the garden.


Neither of the occupants were injured and the house was
undamaged.


The cause of crash was not immediately clear.
