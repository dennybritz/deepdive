Real Madrid's players have firmly backed their iconic captain
Raul Gonzalez and want him to stay, Spanish sports daily Marca
reported on Thursday.


Rumours have been circulating in the Spanish media for weeks that
the 29-year- old striker could leave at the end of the season.


Relations between Raul and the club's new president Ramon
Calderon, who was elected last summer, are believed to have
soured after the player publically criticised Calderon in January
for making adverse comments about the playing staff.


Marca conducted a series of interviews with Real players and they
unanimously pleaded with Raul to stay at the Spanish giants on
Thursday.


"The number 7 of Real Madrid is Raul. He's a perfectionist, I
like him because he's always looking to improve every day," said
Real defender and World Player of the Year Fabio Cannavaro.


"Raul is an institution and he's written some of the most
important pages. He's one of the greats and it would be strange
to see him in another jersey," added Roberto Carlos.


"He's a symbol of Real and I can't imagine the team without him,"
commented Raul's fellow Spanish international Jose Antonio Reyes.


Raul made his debut for Real as a 17-year-old and has made more
than 400 appearances for the club.


He was the Spanish first divisions leading scorer during the
1998-99 and 2000-01 seasons and has been capped 102 times by
Spain, although he has not been picked by Spanish coach Luis
Aragones since September last year.
