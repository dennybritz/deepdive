Bayern Munich defender Willy Sagnol will be sidelined for four
months as a result of the right knee injury he picked up in
Tuesday's Champions League match against AC Milan, his club said.


Bayern said the 30-year-old France full back will undergo surgery
later Thursday on the injury which forced him to go off in the
68th minute of his side's 2-2 quarter final first leg draw in
Milan.


Sagnol has been with Bayern since the 2000/01 season which
culminated with them winning the Champions League.
