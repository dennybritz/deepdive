Iraq is negotiating a 500-million-dollar loan from the World Bank
to help reconstruct its war-torn economy, the prime minister's
office said on Thursday.


A statement from Nuri al-Maliki's office said the cabinet had
authorised Finance Minister Bayan Jabr Solagh to sign the loan
agreement.


"The council of ministers decided in an extraordinary session on
March 29 to authorise the finance minister to negotiate and sign
a loan agreement with the World Bank worth 500 million dollars,"
the statement said.


It provided no further details.


The World Bank has remained active in Iraq but closed its
permanent office in the country after one of its employees was
killed in a truck bombing at the UN complex in Baghdad in August
2003.


The bank has given loans to Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasion,
mainly for improving the country's dilapidated educational
institutions.
