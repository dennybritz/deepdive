Up to 50 people were injured on Thursday when a train carrying
hundreds of rush hour commuters smacked into the rail buffer of a
Paris station, sending passengers flying, police and witnesses
said.


The nine-wagon train carrying 600 people was traveling at slow
speed when it hit the stopper at the Gare de l'Est station, in
eastern Paris, but a commuter told AFP that the impact was still
"very strong" and passengers were thrown to the floor.


"Many passengers were standing up and were getting ready to get
off because the train was late," the commuter said.


Paris police said 50 people were injured and 24 were treated in
hospital.


Paris firefighters put the number of injured at 34, most of them
suffering brusises from being thrown to the floor. One commuter
suffered a broken nose and others had sustained sprains.


A spokesman for the state-owned rail company SNCF said the
passengers suffered "a few bruises" when the train came to a
sudden halt as it arrived at the station at around 8:30 am (0630
GMT).


"It's not an accident, but an incident, which happens from time
to time," said a spokesman, saying the train had "hit the buffer
a bit roughly."


Paris police chief Pierre Mutz went to the station to oversee an
emergency operation in which 115 firefighters and rescue
officials were dispatched to the station.


The train accident caused disruption and delays for other
suburban rail services to Gare de l'Est, a major hub for trains
from the eastern outskirts of Paris.
