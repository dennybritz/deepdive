East Timor's Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta on Thursday appealed
for calm ahead of Monday's presidential election, in which he is
a candidate.


"We never win through threats, coercion and the use of force," he
said in a statement on his website.


"So let's trust more in the power of our ideas and conviction
than in rocks, in machetes and guns. They lead us nowhere. They
create only a cycle of hatred, of revenge and violence."


His appeal came a day after at least 32 people were injured in
various clashes between supporters of rival candidates, the
United Nations said.


Rocks were thrown, five people were injured by steel darts and,
in one incident, UN police fired warning shots amid unrest near
the Australian embassy in the capital, Dili.


The two-week campaign officially ends on Friday.


Atul Khare, head of the UN mission in East Timor, said he was
"quite impressed" with the campaign process but issued his own
appeal for an end to unrest.


"Such behaviour and incidents of violence have no place in a
democratic society," he told reporters.


Khare said that while 90 percent of campaign events had been free
of violence, 15 incidents caused him concern.


Eight candidates are vying to replace President Xanana Gusmao,
who is not seeking re-election.


Last year at least 37 people were killed and 150,000 displaced by
violence that led to the dispatch of Australian-led international
peacekeepers to stabilise the former Portuguese colony.
