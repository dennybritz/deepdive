Malaysia said Thursday that a bomb scare did not mean unrest in
insurgency- wracked southern Thailand had spilled over the
border.


Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said the scare in northern
Penang state Wednesday had only been a hoax.


"Until now, the problem in southern Thailand is restricted to the
region ... it has not extended into our country," Najib was
quoted as saying by the state Bernama news agency.


Thousands of commuters were enveloped in a massive traffic jam
Wednesday for more than two hours after police closed a major
bridge linking the holiday island of Penang to mainland Penang
state to investigate the threat.


Police only found a 15-centimetre (5.91-inch) metal pipe on the
bridge, according to Bernama.


"Bomb hoax phone calls that happen from time to time in this
country have nothing to do with the situation in southern
Thailand," said Najib, also defence minister.


Northern Malaysia and southern Thailand share a common border,
while residents on both sides have close cultural and social
links.


The two countries in February agreed to boost cooperation to end
three years of separatist unrest in the Thailand's south in which
2,000 people have died.
