The new Estonian government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip
formally took office Thursday after being sworn in in parliament,
officials said.


The coalition lead by Ansip, who is head of the liberal-minded
Reform Party, also includes the conservative Pro Patria-Res
Publica and the left-wing Social Democrats.


Ansip first became premier in April 2005, in a coalition
comprising the Reform Party and two centre-left parties, the
Centre Party and the People's Union.


He decided to shake up the coalition after the Reform Party came
top in March 4 parliamentary polls, and won the approval of
parliament Wednesday to form the next government.


The Reform Party holds six posts in the 14-member cabinet, while
Pro Patria-Res Publica has five and the Social Democrats three.


Besides Ansip, the new cabinet includes two members of his
outgoing government: Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and Justice
Minister Rein Lang, both of the Reform Party.


There are three women in the cabinet: Culture Minister Laine
Janes and Social Affairs Minister Maret Maripuu, both of the
Reform Party, plus Population Minister Urve Palo, a Social
Democrat.
