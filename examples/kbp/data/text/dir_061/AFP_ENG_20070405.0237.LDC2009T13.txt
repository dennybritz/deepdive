Indian share prices closed 0.54 percent higher on Thursday on
fund-buying in metal and banking stocks, dealers said.


They said mid and small-cap stocks rose as the markets recovered
for the third straight day after the Sensex posted the sharpest
fall in nearly a year on Monday.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex closed up
69.31 points at 12,856.08.


"Select fund-buying improved market sentiment. But this rally
could be short- lived as long-term buying appetite and liquidity
are missing," said Advait Date, dealer at brokerage BHH
Securities.


The markets will be closed Friday for a public holiday.


Sentiment improved as India's inflation rate eased slightly to
6.39 percent for the week ended March 24, official data showed
Thursday, but remained far above the central bank's tolerance
level of 5.0-5.5 percent.


Gainers led losers 1,658 to 853 on volume of 31.69 billion rupees
(735 million dollars).


The rupee fell against the dollar to 43.1 from its eight-year
high of 42.9 and weakened against the euro to 57.6 from 57.2.


Private sector lender ICICI Bank rose 18 rupees or 2.19 percent
to 838.5 while metals firm Hindustan Zinc rose 29.1 rupees or 4.7
percent to 647.95.
