A pilot was reported missing and a co-pilot rescued Thursday
after they ejected from an Indian military jet before it crashed
into the sea, a navy spokesman said.


The British-built Indian navy Sea Harrier trainer crashed near
the capital of Goa.


'We have sent out rescue vessels to look for the pilots. We have
so far only managed to bring in one," defence ministry spokesman
Abhay Lamlhate said from Panjim, capital of southeastern Goa
state.


The vertical takeoff jets, part of an order from Britain in the
early 1980s, are mostly deployed on the country's sole aircraft
carrier, the INS Viraat.


The Sea Harrier aircraft, which can be flown from an aircraft
carrier or from land, cost about 23 million dollars each.
