South Korea on Thursday allowed four illegal immigrants from
Mongolia to stay legally, citing their heroism in rescuing 11
Koreans from a blaze.


The justice ministry said the four helped the Koreans flee to
safety when a high-rise building under construction in
southwestern Seoul was engulfed in fire last month.


It marked the first time that illegal immigrants have been
granted the right to stay in South Korea in recognition of what
they did for the country, the ministry said.


"Their courage and compassion for others in danger deserve
praise," it said in a statement.
