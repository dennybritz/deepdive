A top Bangladesh election commissioner Thursday ruled out new
polls before late 2008 in order to have time to revise the
country's voter list.


"We will need at least 18 months to prepare the voters list.
Pragmatically speaking, this is the least amount of time we need
to prepare the ground for credible elections," deputy election
commissioner Shakhwat Hossain said.


After months of violent political turmoil, Bangladesh President
Iajuddin Ahmed cancelled polls slated for late January and
declared a state of emergency, paving the way for the
installation of a military-backed government.


The new government vowed to clean up politics and installed new
chiefs at the election commission to carry out sweeping voting
reforms and prepare a new voters list with no errors.
