A strong earthquake shook Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores
archipelago early Thursday, according to the US Geological
Survey's Earthquake Information Center.


The quake measured 6.3 on the open-ended moment magnitude scale,
now often used by seismologists, which measures the area of the
fault that ruptured and the total energy released.


Portugal's Lusa's news agency said there were no immediate
reports of damage, although emergency services had received a
number of calls.


The quake hit at 1:56 am (0356 GMT), centered 93 kilometers (58
miles) east of Ponta Delgada, the Azores capital, the USGS said.
The epicenter was at a depth of 10 kilometers (six miles).


The archipelago, located some 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) west
of mainland Portugal, is full of extinct volcanos, and
earthquakes and tremors are a frequent occurrence.


The nine-island chain has a population of about 237,000.
