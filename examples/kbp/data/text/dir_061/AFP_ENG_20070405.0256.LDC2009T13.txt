Japan and other major developed nations called Thursday for East
Timor's first post-independence presidential race to be held
fairly and peacefully.


Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Aso held telephone talks with East
Timor President Xanana Gusmao after Japan sent an election
monitoring team to the young nation, which achieved independence
in 2002.


"Aso said Japan hopes the East Timor government will make further
efforts to improve security and that the Japanese government will
continue providing utmost support for nation-building," a foreign
ministry statement said.


Gusmao told Aso that his government will do its best to hold a
peaceful election that meets the expectations of the
international community, including Japan, the statement said.


The vote planned Monday is the first for president since the
impoverished country achieved independence in 2002 after 24 years
of Indonesian occupation and a period of UN stewardship.


Dili-based envoys from Japan, the United States, the European
Commission, New Zealand and East Timor's former colonial power
Portugal also issued a joint statement calling for a fair ballot
and pledging continued support.


"We call on all citizens to exercise their right to vote and for
all involved to conduct themselves appropriately," said the
statement, a copy of which was released here.


"There is no place for violence or the use of other coercive
means during voting or in response to election results."
