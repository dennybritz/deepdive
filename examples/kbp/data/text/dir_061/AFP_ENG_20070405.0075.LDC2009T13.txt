French anti-terrorism police have opened an investigation after
death threats were made against presidential frontrunner Nicolas
Sarkozy, a police source said Thursday.


The probe began on Monday after a television employee and
official from the opposition Socialist Party received e-mail
messages that read "Attack on Sarkozy, Lyon, April 5 2007."


Sarkozy, the candidate of the governing party, is due to travel
on Thursday to France's second city of Lyon for an election
rally.


Police have stepped up Sarkozy's security detail, the source
said.


Sarkozy, 52, is leading in public opinion polls for the April 22
vote, followed closely by Socialist rival Segolene Royal.


A runoff vote is scheduled for May 6 as none of the 12 candidates
are expected to win an outright majority in the first round.
