Rare paintings, artefacts and manuscripts housed at Sri Lanka's
national museum in Colombo were damaged by heavy rain while the
roof was being repaired, an official said Thursday.


Contractors fixing the 130-year-old museum building had left
historical paintings housed in the upper floor of the building
exposed to the rains earlier this week.


"The bigger 400-year old cloth paintings got soaked during heavy
rains," museum director Nanda Wickramasinghe said.


"The rainwater came gushing down the walls, wetting the paintings
and damaging the wooden floors," she said.


Rainwater also seeped into the lower floors of the white colonial
building which housed the main library.


Museum staff were in the process of salvaging historical
documents, manuscripts and rare books, she said.


The 81,000-dollar roof renovation had been given to the
government-owned State Engineering Corp which had sub-contracted
the work to a private firm.


"Workers attached to the private contractor had not followed our
instructions of doing the roof repairs in stages," she said.


Authorities were in the process of assessing the damages.


"It will take weeks to dry the paintings and the museum staff
have now covered the paintings with plastic sheets to prevent
further damage," the official said.


The museum was established in 1877 during Britain's 100-year old
occupation which ended in 1948.
