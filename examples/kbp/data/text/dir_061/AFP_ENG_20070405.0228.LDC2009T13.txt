Industrial output in Germany rose by 0.9 percent in February,
suggesting that an increased value-added tax introduced in
January had less impact than previously expected, government data
released on Thursday showed.


The month-on-month rise, calculated on a seasonally-adjusted
basis by the German economy ministry, defied analysts'
expectations of a one percent drop in production.


The ministry revised industrial output data for January however
to a monthly increase of 0.9 percent, down from a previously
reported rise of 1.9 percent.


Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government raised value-
added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent on January 1.
