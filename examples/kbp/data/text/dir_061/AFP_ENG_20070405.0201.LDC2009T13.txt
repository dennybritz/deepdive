Authorities have lifted a 40-year ban on the wearing of hoods for
Easter celebrations in the Sicilian village of Corleone,
birthplace of major Mafia bosses who are now behind bars or dead,
a press report said Thursday.


The processions were banned because of the fear that hooded Mafia
clan members could infiltrate them to settle scores with
impunity.


Corleone, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the capital
Palermo, was the birthplace of Mafia bosses Luciano Leggio, who
died in 1993, Salvatore "Toto" Riina, arrested the same year, and
Bernardo Provenzano, who was arrested in April 2006 after 43
years on the run.


Mario Puzo named the central character in his book "The
Godfather" after the town.


The mayor, the local church and the confraternities that stage
the processions called for an end to the ban after Provenzano's
arrest.


"We determined that this would be a way to restore confidence to
the people of Corleone," Palermo police chief Giuseppe Caruso
told the daily La Repubblica. "We will continue to be vigilant,
but Corleone is no longer the stronghold of godfathers."


Hooded penitents are a feature of many traditional Easter
celebrations around Italy.
