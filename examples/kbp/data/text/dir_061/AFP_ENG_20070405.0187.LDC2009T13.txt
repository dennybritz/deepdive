Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o says he has not fully recovered
from a knee injury he sustained in September which sidelined him
for four months.


"The injury is still there. It is improving but I am still not at
100 percent.


"The truth is that we are very far from seeing the best Eto'o,"
the Cameroon international told Thursday's Spanish sports
newspaper Marca.


Eto'o underwent surgery shortly after he ruptured the meniscus in
his right knee during Barcelona's Champions League match against
Werder Bremen on September 27, 2006.


He returned to the pitch at the beginning of February, sooner
than initially predicted by Barcelona's medical staff, and has
scored four times since his comeback.


Eto'o, a three-time African Footballer of the Year, was the top
scorer in the Spanish league alst season with 26 goals.
