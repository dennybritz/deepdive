British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday that the release
of the 15 detainees from Iran had been secured "without any
deal".


They were freed "without any deal, without any negotiation,
without any side agreement of any nature whatever," he said,
making a statement outside his 10 Downing Street office.
