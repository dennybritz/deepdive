Three more American soldiers have been killed in Baghdad, where
Iraqi and US forces are pressing a massive security crackdown
into an eighth week, the military announced on Thursday.


Two of the soldiers were killed and another three wounded in a
roadside bomb attack ripped through their combat patrol in a
southern part of Baghdad on Wednesday, the military said.


Insurgents shot dead a third soldier during a routine patrol in
an eastern district of the Iraqi capital on Tuesday, a separate
statement said.


The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 2,358, according to an AFP tally based
on Pentagon figures.
