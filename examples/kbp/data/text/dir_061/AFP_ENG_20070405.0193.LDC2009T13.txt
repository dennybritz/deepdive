Sevilla's Brazilian international right back Daniel Alves and
first choice goalkeeper Andres Palop are fit to face Tottenham
Hotspur, the club confirmed here Thursday.


The reigning UEFA Cup holders play host to the Londoners later
Thursday in a UEFA Cup quarter-final first leg match which
features arguably the two strongest teams remaining in the
competition.


"Whoever wins this fixture, I think will go through to the
final," said Sevilla coach Juande Ramos on Thursday.


Both players missed Sevilla's 0-0 draw at Osasuna in La Liga on
Sunday with minor injury problems.


Alves sustained a mild ankle sprain playing for his country last
week while Palop, who saved Sevilla with a headed goal in the
dying second of normal time at Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk in
the last round, has recovered from the muscle spasms in his leg
that he was suffering from in training last week.


Sevilla club doctor Adolfo Munoz said both players had passed
fitness tests on Wednesday.
