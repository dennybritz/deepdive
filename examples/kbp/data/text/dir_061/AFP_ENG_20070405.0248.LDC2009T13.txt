The first gay-themed chat show to appear in China debuted online
on Thursday, with the host and guests discussing the challenges
of being homosexual in the country's conservative society.


The first of 12 episodes of "Tong Xing Xiang Lian", or "Gay
Connections", appeared on the website of Hong Kong-based
broadcaster Phoenix Television and three other sites.


Host Didier Zheng, a French-educated homosexual, kicked off the
show with a discussion of gay issues with guest Qiao Qiao, the
lesbian owner of a Beijing gay bar.


Other guests later exchanged tips on how to handle the pressures
faced by gays and lesbians in a country where homosexuality is
still largely a taboo subject, and how and where to meet others
to expand one's circle of gay friends.


The weekly live show appeared on the online video pages of
Phoenixtv.com, and the Chinese portals Sina.com, QQ.com and
Mop.com. The government normally blocks access in China to
content viewed as undesirable.


China has a gay population estimated in the tens of millions but
homosexuality is still a largely taboo subject in the country due
to a mix of traditional conservatism and communist prejudice
against gays.


It was listed as a mental disorder until 2001.


Official disapproval has softened somewhat since then, with a top
university last year publishing the first report focused on gay
sex among men in China.


Authorities have even allowed some officially sanctioned gay
Internet chatrooms in Beijing.


However, the government remains nervous about the subject and has
blocked access to some overseas gay-oriented sites.
