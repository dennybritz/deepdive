Uganda's constitutional court on Thursday scrapped a law against
adultery because it found it discriminated against women, in a
victory for female activists after a year-long battle.


"With a unanimous decision, the court ruled that the sections
under contest were null and void, meaning that the adultery law
is now dead," Joseph Murangira, the constitutional court
registrar, told AFP.


The court ruled in favour of a group of female activists to
expunge the law from the penal code in the name of sexual
equality, he said.


The scrapped law states that it is an offence for a married woman
to have an affair with a man, whether he is married or not.


However, under the same law, a man only commits adultery if he
has an affair with a married woman, not if it is with an
unmarried woman.


In the same ruling, the court also voided parts of succession law
which gave more rights to men on the death of their wives, than
to widows.


Lawyers from the group Law and Advocacy for Women in Uganda
brought the case against the country's attorney general last
April.


"The law was setting two standards for women and men," the
group's lawyer Ladislaus Rwakafuzi told AFP.


"The adultery offence no longer exists on the statute books of
the country after this ruling. People can now be guided by their
marriage's contractual obligations and their faith."
