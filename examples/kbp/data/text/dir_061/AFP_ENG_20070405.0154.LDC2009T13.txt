World Trade Organisation members have voiced frustration at the
slow pace of negotiations ahead of a ministerial meeting of key
players in New Delhi next week, sources close to the talks said
Thursday.


The comments came on Wednesday as WTO director general Pascal
Lamy chaired a meeting which was attended by some 30
representatives of member states.


"The frustration is mounting," a source close to the talks said,
not least over the inability of the G4 group -- the EU, US,
Brazil and India -- to agree a common position on agriculture.


Member states said the chairs of negotiating groups should put
their positions on the table.


The chair of the agriculture group, New Zealand's Crawford
Falconer, has already said he will present a text by the end of
April.


Trade ministers from the G4 will meet in New Delhi on April
11-12, and will then be joined by their equivalent ministers from
Australia and Japan.


The Doha talks, launched in 2001 in the Qatari capital, aim to
remove barriers to global trade but are currently deadlocked,
notably over steps to reduce agricultural tariffs and subsidies.


Within the G4, the US and the EU have engaged in bitter arguments
over trade in agricultural goods, with Brussels demanding more
reductions in US farm subsidies and Washington insisting that
proposed European tariff cuts do not go far enough.
