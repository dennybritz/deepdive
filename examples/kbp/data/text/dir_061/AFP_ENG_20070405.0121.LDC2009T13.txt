Iran broadcast new pictures of 15 British sailors preparing to
fly out of Tehran on Thursday, showing them opening an array
traditional gifts before departing.


The 14 men and one woman smiled and laughed as they sipped tea
and waited to board their plane in the plush surroudings of the
presidential lounge at Tehran's international airport.


The pictures aired on Iran's Arabic language channel Al-Alam
showed the sailors opening gifts that ranged from traditional
handicrafts to Iranian pistachio nuts.


Their luggage, packed into a combination of matching traditional
Iranian woven bags and sports holdalls laid on by the
authorities, was also shown.


British ambassador Geoffrey Adams was then seen ushering the 15
on to a bus that would take them to the British Airways plane
that later took off for London on the overcast morning.


The flight is scheduled to touch down in London at midday (1100
GMT).
