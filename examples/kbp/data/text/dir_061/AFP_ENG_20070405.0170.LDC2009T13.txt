The price of nickel struck an all-time high of 50,000 dollars per
tonne in London trading on Thursday owing to falling stockpiles
of the base metal, traders said.


It was the highest reading for nickel since the start of its
quotation on the London Metal Exchange in 1979. Nickel is used to
help prevent corrosion.
