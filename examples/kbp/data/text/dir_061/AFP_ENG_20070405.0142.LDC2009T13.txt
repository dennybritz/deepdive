A public exchange offer for shares in the troubled Channel tunnel
operator Eurotunnel will run from April 10 to May 15, the company
said Thursday.


Eurotunnel's board recommended that shareholders accept the offer
of one share in the entity's new holding company, Groupe
Eurotunnel (GET) plus one share warrant, for each old Eurotunnel
share tendered.


The acceptance threshold for the offer to go forward is 60
percent of outstanding Eurotunnel shares.


If it does not, Eurotunnel warned, "continued operation would not
be ensured" and the company would "probably be placed in
liquidation."


The tunnel, through which passes the high-speed Eurostar train
that connects London with Brussels and Paris, was nonetheless
expected to remain in operation.


On Wednesday, the French stock market watchdog AMF approved the
exchange offer, which is aimed at creating GET in place of two
French and British companies that comprise Eurotunnel at present.


In November, holders of the company's 6.3 billion euros (8.4
billion dollars) in bank debt as well as its suppliers voted in
favour of a safeguard plan for Eurotunnel, which was approved by
the Paris Commercial Court in January.


In early March, Eurotunnel reported that it had stemmed losses
last year following a catastrophic 12 months in 2005.


The group said it made a loss of 204 million euros (268 million
dollars) in 2006 compared with a loss of 2.808 billion euros in
2005.


It said operating profit had increased by 42 percent to 326
million euros in 2006 compared with 230 million euros in 2005.
