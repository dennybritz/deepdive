East Timor's Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta on Thursday appealed
for calm ahead of Monday's presidential election, in which he is
a candidate.


"We never win through threats, coercion and the use of force," he
said in a statement on his website.


"So let's trust more in the power of our ideas and conviction
than in rocks, in machetes and guns. They lead us nowhere, they
create only a cycle of hatred, of revenge and violence."


His appeal came a day after UN police fired warning shots amid
unrest near the Australian embassy in the capital, Dili. Five
people were injured in violence involving supporters of rival
candidates, UN police said.


The two-week campaign officially ends on Friday.


Atul Khare, head of the UN mission in East Timor, said he was
"quite impressed" with the campaign process but issued his own
appeal for an end to unrest.


"Such behaviour and incidents of violence have no place in a
democratic society," he told reporters.


Khare said that while 90 percent of campaign events were free of
violence, 15 incidents caused him concern.


Eight candidates are vying to replace President Xanana Gusmao,
who is not seeking re-election.


Last year at least 37 people were killed and 150,000 displaced by
violence that led to the dispatch of Australian-led international
peacekeepers to stabilise the former Portuguese colony.
