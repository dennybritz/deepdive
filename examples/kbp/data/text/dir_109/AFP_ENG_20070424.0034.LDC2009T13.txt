BJ Upton homered and drove in four runs and Rocco Baldelli
smacked a three-run blast for Tampa Bay en route to a 10-8 win
over red-hot Alex Rodriguez and the New York Yankees.


It was another eye-popping performance on Monday by Rodriguez,
who blasted two more homers and drove in three runs - going
4-for-5 - to increase his league- leading power numbers to 14
homers and 34 RBI.


"He's always been good, but this is (abnormal)," Tampa Bay
manager Joe Maddon said of Rodriguez.


"I don't know what we'll do (Tuesday)."


The pair of blasts tied Rodriguez with St. Louis Cardinals
slugger Albert Pujols, who also belted 14 homers in April last
season - a major league record.


"It's easy to say 'wow' when we're winning games," Rodriguez
said.  "We're kind of in the midst of a grind. It's a long season
and we have to work ourselves out (of the slump)."


But the star third baseman was upstaged by Upton, who blasted a
solo homer in the fourth off Kei Igawa and a bases-clearing
double in the seventh inning to give the Devil Rays a 10-6 lead.


"Give credit to the guys in front on me," Upton said.


Upton's homer hit off the foul pole and just above the four-foot
fence in the left field corner.
