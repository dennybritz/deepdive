Taiwan's AU Optronics on Tuesday reported a net loss of 5.11
billion Taiwan dollars (154 million US) for the first quarter of
2007 due to declines in shipments and flat panel prices.


The figures compared with a net profit of 1.66 billion in the
2006 fourth quarter and a net profit of 6.65 billion a year
earlier, said the world's third biggest flat-panel maker.


Sales in the first quarter to March also dropped 14.72 percent to
80.72 billion dollars, it said.


"Our loading factor in the first quarter was only 80 percent, and
there was an average 11 percent (sequential) decline in panel
prices," said the company's chief financial officer Max Chang.


Other than seasonality, the lower-than-expected loading factor,
or its use of factories, was derived from a delay in AU's fully
taking account of the capacity of Quanta Display Inc acquired
earlier, Chang said.


This added capacity could not be fully used as the company must
wait for certification by customers to run its course, he said.


Despite a 70 percent year-on-year increase, AU's shipments of
large-sized panels - those measuring at least 10 inches
diagonally - fell 4.1 percent sequentially to 15.9 million units
in the first quarter.


At a quarterly briefing to investors, AU said it expected a
rebound in liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices and
shipments from the second quarter due to improved supply-demand
situation.


Shipments of small and medium-sized and large-sized LCD panels in
the second quarter were expected to increase by 25 and 10
percent, respectively, from the first.
