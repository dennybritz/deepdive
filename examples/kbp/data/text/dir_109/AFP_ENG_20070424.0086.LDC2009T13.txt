The armed wing of the ruling Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas
on Tuesday said a five-month truce with the Israeli army "no
longer exists" after it fired dozens of rockets into the Jewish
state.


"The truce no longer exists," a spokesman for the Ezzedine al-
Qassam Brigades, Abu Obaida, told AFP.


"It's the Israeli enemy that has not respected it and now it's
the turn of Palestinian groups," he said.


The statement came after the group said it had fired nearly 30
rockets and 61 mortars into Israel as the Jewish state marked its
59th anniversary.


It marked the first time that Hamas, the senior partner in the
Palestinian coalition cabinet, claimed responsibility for
launching rockets into Israel since a November 26 ceasefire took
effect between the army and Gaza militants.


Abu Obaida said the firing of Tuesday's projectiles was a
response to the death of nine Palestinians, two teenagers and
five militants among them, by Israeli troops over the weekend in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza.


The deaths marked the bloodiest weekend of Israeli-Palestinian
violence since the November truce and sparked calls for
retaliation on the part of Palestinian militant groups.


Under the terms of the November ceasefire, the Israeli army
withdrew troops from the Gaza Strip and militants there were
supposed to halt rocket fire into the Jewish state.


Until Tuesday the truce has largely held despite violations by
both sides.
