Switzerland's trade surplus in the first quarter of 2007 grew by
52 percent year-on-year to reach 3.25 billion Swiss francs (1.98
billion euros, 2.69 billion dollars), authorities said Tuesday.


The Federal Customs Office reported strong trade performance
across the board in its latest data, despite a slight easing of
overall export and import growth compared to the same period in
2006.


Exports in the first three months of 2007 grew 12.6 percent in
nominal terms to reach 48.26 billion Swiss francs, while imports
increased 10.5 percent to reach 45.02 billion Swiss francs.


The strongest export performance was recorded in the food,
tobacco, metallurgy, watch and plastics industries, while growth
in three traditional pillars of Swiss trade, precision
instruments, machine tools and chemicals, slowed.


Exports to all regions of the world maintained double digit
growth, led by developing and transition countries, notably
India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. Exports to Switzerland's biggest
market, the European Union, increased by 11.2 percent in the
first quarter.


Imports were led by raw materials and semi-finished goods.


However, overall energy imports declined 12 percent, depressing
trade with OPEC nations (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries). Swiss imports from oil and gas producing Kazakhstan
quadrupled, the customs office said.
