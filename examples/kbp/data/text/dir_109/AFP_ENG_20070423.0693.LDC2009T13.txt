China's leaders are hoping that Karl Marx can shift the country's
Internet users away from "decadent" content and help them clean
up the Web, state media reported.


The Communist Party's Politburo this week asked media and
cultural groups to promote and produce more "healthy online
cultural products" including promotion of the ideology of
Marxism, Xinhua news agency reported late Monday.


The government wants the Internet to "represent the social
progress and the splendid traditional culture of China", the
agency said, quoting a release from the meeting, which was led by
President Hu Jintao.


The campaign's aim is to nurture a healthy online culture and
prevent "decadent" material from spreading, Xinhua said.


China's Communist Party leaders, who enforce strict curbs on the
press, have made no secret of the fact they regard the Internet
as a threat and that it should be subjected to the same controls
as traditional media.


In January, Hu called on the party to "purify" China's Internet
community, which is rapidly growing as the country's economy
expands.


The numbers going online jumped by almost 24 percent last year to
reach 137 million, around one in ten Chinese, Xinhua quoted the
China Internet Network Information Center as saying.


The country recently launched a crackdown on Internet pornography
and last month capped the number of new cybercafes allowed to
open this year, a measure state media said was aimed at stemming
growing Internet addiction.
