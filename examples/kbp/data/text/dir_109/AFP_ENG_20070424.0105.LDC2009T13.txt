Two miners were killed and three injured when a shaft collapsed
at a coal mine in the southern Polish city of Katowice, the
company that runs the mine said Tuesday.


The shaft, 720 metres (yards) underground, at the Staszic mine
collapsed late Monday, Krzysztof Chojnacki, the deputy director
of the company that runs the mine, was quoted by Poland's PAP
news as saying.


Of the five miners working in the shaft at the time of the
accident, two were found dead by rescue workers, who quickly
brought two slightly injured miners to the surface.


The fifth miner, who suffered more serious injuries, was pulled
from the shaft after a rescue operation that lasted several
hours.


Last year, 48 miners were killed in accidents in Poland.


Among them were 23 miners killed when a methane explosion ripped
through a shaft at the Halemba mine in the southern province of
Silesia, the worst mining accident in Poland in 30 years.
