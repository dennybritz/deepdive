Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi warned Tuesday US complaints at the
WTO against China for alleged copyright abuse and market access
restrictions will have an "extremely negative" impact, local
media said.


"This is rare and actually the first time that a member country
of the World Trade Organisation files two complaints at the same
time against another member," Wu told a high-level forum on
copyright protection here in Beijing.


"It will have an extremely negative impact and severely affect
the bilateral cooperation on intellectual property protection,"
she said, according to the sina.com website.


"It will also impair the cooperative relationship the two parties
have already established on the market access for publications."


She said the move by Washington to take China before the WTO over
counterfeiting of US products and distribution restrictions of
publications "completely ignored the tremendous progress made by
China".


"The Chinese government is extremely dissatisfied with the move,"
Wu said. "But we will respond to it positively according to
pertinent regulations in the WTO and fight through to the end."


Other senior officials echoed Wu's comments, accusing the critics
of China's copyright record as being biased and unfair.


"It is not right for them to observe China while wearing
blinkers," Tian Lipu, commissioner of the State Intellectual
Property Office, said in an online interview with the government
web site www.gov.cn on Monday.


He said critics ignored "huge strides" achieved by China in
improving intellectual property rights protection.
