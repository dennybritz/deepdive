Tokyo businessman Joji Obara, who was jailed for life Tuesday for
a series of brutal sex assaults, preyed on young Japanese and
foreign women, according to the charge-sheet and his lawyer.


However Obara, 54, was acquitted of the abduction and death of
British bar hostess Lucie Blackman in what was arguably the most
high-profile of the cases against him.


Obara's lawyer said his client was convicted of attacking nine
women in all. They were: five Japanese women; Australian bar
hostess Carita Ridgway, 21, who died of her injuries in hospital;
a Briton other than Blackman; a Canadian; and a Ukrainian woman.


For those attacks he was found guilty on six counts of obscene
acts, two of rape resulting in injury, and one count, in
Ridgway's case, of rape resulting in death.


He was acquitted of all charges related to Blackman, which were
abduction, assaults resulting in death and mutilation and
abandonment of a corpse.


Obara was not charged with murder, which would mean he intended
to kill and would have made him eligible for the death penalty.


He pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said he plans to appeal.
