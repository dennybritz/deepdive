Russian President Vladimir Putin has postponed until Thursday his
annual state- of-the-nation speech due to former president Boris
Yeltsin's funeral, the Kremlin said in a statement.


Putin was due to make the speech at a joint session of both
houses of parliament on Wednesday, the day now set for Yeltsin's
funeral.


In his speech Putin is expected to outline his vision of Russia's
future while also burnishing his reputation, ahead of a
presidential vote next March at which he is due to stand down.
