Japanese share prices slumped 0.80 percent in morning trade
Tuesday, depressed by Wall Street's retreat overnight, brokers
said.


They said a number of investors remained on the sidelines ahead
of the release of corporate earnings reports by key Japanese
companies starting this week.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 140.18 points to 17,315.19 by the lunch break.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares lost 13.22
points or 0.78 percent to 1,692.41.
