Tamil Tiger rebels Tuesday carried out an air attack against Sri
Lankan security forces using two light aircraft, a guerrilla
spokesman told AFP.


Two light aircraft of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
dropped bombs on a military air base in the Jaffna peninsula just
after midnight, spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said.


"We have carried out our second air attack ... on the Palaly air
field and their military stores," Ilanthiriyan said by satellite
telephone from somewhere in northern Sri Lanka. There was no
immediate word from the military.


The rebels, whose drawn-out campaign for an independent state for
the island's ethnic Tamil minority has left more than 60,000
people dead, carried out their first-ever aerial attack on Sri
Lankan forces last month.
