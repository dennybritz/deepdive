Japanese share prices closed flat Tuesday, weighed down by Wall
Street's retreat overnight and investor caution ahead of a slew
of domestic company results, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 3.6 points to 17,451.77.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares added 0.53
points to 1,706.16.
