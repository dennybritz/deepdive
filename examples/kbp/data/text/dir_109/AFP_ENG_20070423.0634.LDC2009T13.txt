Japanese auto maker Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. plans to reduce
domestic jobs by introducing an early retirement programme
targeting some 12,000 non-management staff, a newspaper reported
on Tuesday.


The move marks Nissan's first domestic job cuts in eight years,
as Japan's second-largest automaker does not expect sales to
recover sharply in the near future, the Nikkei business daily
said without citing sources.


Under the plan, Nissan will seek volunteers aged 45 and above to
take early retirement for the six months from June, while it will
not set a target figure for the layoffs, the paper said.


Nissan is scheduled to announce the early retirement programme
later in the day, it said.


In an effort to cope with sluggish sales, Nissan this month began
scaling back production at its Oppama plant in Kanagawa,
southwest of Tokyo, and another facility in Tochigi, northeast of
the capital.


The automaker embarked on a restructuring in 1999 under president
Carlos Ghosn, who decided to cut 16,500 domestic jobs.
