South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun on Tuesday praised Boris
Yeltsin for laying "firm ground" for friendly ties between the
two countries.


"The late Russian president Yeltsin made a great contribution to
world peace and helped promote peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula and the Northeast Asian region," Roh said in a message
of condolences.


"Especially, we will remember that he laid firm ground for
friendly ties between the Republic of Korea and Russia."


Yeltsin died Monday at the age of 76.


South Korea established diplomatic relations with the Soviet
Union in September 1990. In November 1992 Yeltsin visited Seoul
and signed a treaty governing relations between Russia and South
Korea.


Former prime minister Han Myeong-Sook will lead a delegation to
the funeral in Moscow on Wednesday.
