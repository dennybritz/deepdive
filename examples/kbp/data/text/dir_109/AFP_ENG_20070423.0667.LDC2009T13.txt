Tamil Tiger rebels used aircraft to target Sri Lanka's main
military complex in the Jaffna peninsula Tuesday but were beaten
back by ground fire, the army chief said on national television.


Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka said they used ground fire to
attack the rebel aircraft which changed course and bombed a
nearby army detachment. His remarks contradicted the defence
ministry, which denied a rebel air strike.


"Troops at the forward defence lines saw them coming and alerted
the Palaly base and they used all their resources to direct fire
at the aircraft," Fonseka said.
