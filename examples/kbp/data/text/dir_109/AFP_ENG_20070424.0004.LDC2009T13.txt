A South Korean firm said Tuesday it is developing a mobile phone
which allows users to feel broadcasts as well as seeing and
hearing them.


"We have developed new mobile phone technology which adds the
sense of touch to the traditional modes of sight and hearing,"
said LG Electronics spokesman Song Keun-Young.


The phone can vibrate when a shot hits the net in a football game
or a car hits the wall in a TV drama, he said.


"If a bomb explodes in an action movie, light-emitting diodes
blink in tune with the audio-visual content, on display in three
dimensions," Song said.


LG plans to market new models using the three-dimensional and
sensing technology next year after securing content, he said.


The models will carry terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting
(DMB), which provides clear video, high-quality audio and data
through handheld devices or terminals in cars, he said.


MBC, a broadcasting network, started DMB services in late 2005.
