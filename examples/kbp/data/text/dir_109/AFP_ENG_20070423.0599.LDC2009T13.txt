English Premiership highflyers Everton's hopes of maintaining
their place in the UEFA Cup next season suffered a blow on Monday
when it was confirmed England striker Andy Johnson had suffered a
sprained ankle.


The 26-year-old suffered the injury in the 1-0 defeat by
relegation threatened West Ham on Saturday - which still sees
them in fifth position and on course for the UEFA Cup next term -
and it was confirmed following a scan on Monday.


However, head physiotherapist Mick Rathbone has refused to
predict when the seven-times capped Johnson - who has scored 12
goals in 35 matches in all competitions for Everton this season -
will be fit to play again.


"It's too soon to estimate recovery time but the good thing is
that the player normally heals quite quickly."


Everton are presently ahead of Bolton on goal difference while
Reading are just three points off the pace.


They have three games remaining and will next face Manchester
United at Goodison Park on Saturday.
