Hong Kong Airlines has said it will launch daily flights to Hanoi
from Wednesday, rivalling Vietnam Airlines and Cathay Pacific,
which have so far dominated the route with a code-sharing
service.


The airline will use Boeing 737-800 jets able to carry up to 164
passengers for the one hour and 45 minute flight, said the state-
run Vietnam News Agency.


Hong Kong Airlines will be the 24th airline to operate flights to
Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport after getting the go-ahead
from the communist country's Civil Aviation Administration, said
Vietnamese media reports.


Thailand's low-cost carrier Nok Air has also recently announced
plans to start daily services from Bangkok to Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh City.
