Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso paid tribute to late Russian
president Boris Yeltsin for building a "new foundation" between
the two neighbours.


"Representing the Japanese government and Japanese people, I
would like to offer my sincere condolences on the death of the
Russian Federation's first president Yeltsin," Aso said in a
statement.


"He built a new foundation of progress in Japan-Russia relations
with his efforts to resolve territorial issues."


Japan and Russia have yet to sign a peace treaty formally ending
World War II, due to a dispute over four islands seized by Soviet
troops days after Tokyo surrendered in 1945.


Yeltsin and former prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto reached a
landmark accord in 1997 to "maximise" efforts to resolve the
dispute and sign a peace treaty by 2000, but the two countries
failed to achieve that goal.


Yeltsin, the former president who brought down the Soviet Union
and led Russia through the traumatic transition to democracy and
capitalism, died Monday aged 76.
