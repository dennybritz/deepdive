Iran on Tuesday said it sees "no reason for negotiation" over its
nuclear programme if the European Union maintains an insistence
on Tehran suspending its uranium enrichment activities.


A day before Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and EU
foreign policy chief Javier Solana meet for key talks in Turkey,
the government spokesman warned the bloc against making
"illogical demands".


"We took a legal path for the progress of the country and we are
seeking legitimate technology which cannot be stopped or turned
back," said government spokesman Gholam Hossein Elham.


"There is no reason to do so," he told reporters, when asked if
Larijani would offer a suspension during the talks with Solana.


"These requests are not based on logic and law and there is no
reason to pursue it in a logical dialogue.


"If they are seeking something illogical, then there is no reason
for dialogue and negotiation because negotiation should be within
the framework of law and logic," he warned.


The sensitivity of enriched uranium lies in the fact the
substance can be used both to make nuclear fuel and, in highly
enriched form, the explosive core of a nuclear bomb. Iran insists
it only wants to produce civilian energy.
