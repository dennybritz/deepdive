China produced 46 million tonnes of crude oil in the first
quarter, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier, while coal output
rose 14.8 percent to 494.9 million tonnes, the National Bureau of
Statistics said.


In March alone, crude output was down 0.3 percent at 15.7 million
tonnes, with coal production last month increasing 10.3 percent
to 177.8 million tonnes, the NBS said on its website.


The figures appeared to reflect the relative availability of
energy resources in China, which has abundant coal reserves,
while most estimates suggest crude oil is a dwindling resource.


China is the world's largest producer as well as consumer of
coal. Currently coal accounts for about 70 percent of the
country's primary energy consumption, over 40 percentage points
higher than the world's average level.


Meanwhile, with domestic on-shore oil reserves declining, energy-
hungry China is turning its attention to Middle East, Africa and
other resource-rich regions and increasingly looking to deepwater
hydrocarbon resources.


It imported a record 47 percent of its oil last year, an increase
of 4.1 percentage points from a year earlier, according to
government statistics.
