Food prices in military-run Myanmar have soared over the past
year, a report said Tuesday, putting economic strain on residents
already struggling with continuing inflation.


Prices of chicken, cooking oil, onions and rice in April all shot
up more than 60 percent year-on-year, the Weekly Eleven news
journal said, citing a household survey conducted by the
publication.


The finding came as Myanmar arrested seven people Sunday during a
rare protest against economic hardships here, which followed a
similar economic rally against the ruling junta in February.


The steepest increases were for chicken, which jumped more than
80 percent to 4.40 dollars per 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds) in
April, and cooking oil, which rose 76 percent to 1.76 dollars per
1.6 kilograms.


"I can hardly manage on my income due to the soaring prices even
though my salary increased" in last April, a schoolteacher was
quoted by the journal as saying. The journal did not give details
on how the survey was conducted.


Despite its rich natural resources, Myanmar is one of the world's
poorest nations and is subject to US and European economic
sanctions due to its human rights abuses, including house arrest
of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.


Decades of economic mismanagement have also worsened living
conditions here as residents in Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city,
are left without electricity for most of the day.


Myanmar's inflation rate in 2006 was estimated at 21.4 percent,
according to a US government report.
