At least six soldiers were killed and six wounded Tuesday in a
Tamil Tiger air attack on security forces in Sri Lanka's Jaffna
peninsula, military sources said.


They were killed when Tiger aircraft bombed the Milady military
detachment in an attack against the sprawling Palaly military
complex, the sources said.


Army commander Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka said the
military used ground fire to attack the rebel aircraft which
changed course and bombed the Milady detachment.


"Troops at the forward defence lines saw them coming and alerted
the Palaly base and they used all their resources to direct fire
at the aircraft," Fonseka said.


"They were forced to change course and, while returning, they
dropped two bombs on Milady."


There was no immediate word from the defence ministry, which had
earlier denied a Tiger air attack and insisted the guerrillas
only fired artillery.
