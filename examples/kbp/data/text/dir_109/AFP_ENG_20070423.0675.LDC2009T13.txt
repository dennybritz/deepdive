Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels set off a bomb in northern Sri
Lanka, killing five bus passengers and wounding another 33,
defence officials said Tuesday.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) set off the blast in
the district of Vavuniya, 250 kilometres (150 miles) north of
Colombo just before midnight on Monday, the ministry said.


Military officials said the blast was caused by a mine planted by
the side of the road to target the vehicle.


It came two hours ahead of a rebel air attack against government
troops in the Jaffna peninsula, further north of Vavuniya,
officials said.


The rebels said they staged the air attack using two of their
light aircraft.


Earlier this month the Tigers were blamed for a blast that hit
another bus in the same area of Vavuniya, killing eight
passengers and wounding 25.


That attack came five days after a bomb exploded inside a bus in
the east of the island, killing 17 people and wounding 25.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
violence that began in December 2005, despite a truce arranged in
2002 to end the bloody ethnic conflict.


The Tigers have waged a 35-year campaign for independence for the
Tamil minority which has claimed more than 60,000 lives on the
Sinhalese-majority island.
