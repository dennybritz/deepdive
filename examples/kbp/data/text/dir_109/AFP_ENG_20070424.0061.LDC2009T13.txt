Toyota Motor Corp. became the world's best selling automaker in
the three months to March, overtaking US rival General Motors,
results from the Japanese automaker showed Tuesday.


Japan's top automaker sold 2.348 million vehicles in the first
quarter of 2007, a company spokesman said, beating GM which
earlier this month reported record global sales of 2.26 million
cars and trucks for the same period.


Toyota is enjoying brisk demand, particularly in the United
States, as higher prices at the pump boost demand for compact
cars, small sport utility vehicles and hybrids which use a mix of
electricity and petrol.


The Japanese automaker is expected to report later this month a
seventh consecutive year of record profits on the back of brisk
shipments overseas.


Toyota has projected operating income of 2.20 trillion yen (18.55
billion dollars) for the fiscal year to March 2007, which would
make it the first Japanese company to post a two trillion yen
operating profit.


Toyota has been expanding its production in the United States to
try to avoid trade friction with Washington and just this month
named the head of its fast- growing North American operations as
its first foreign director.


Struggling GM in contrast made a loss of two billion dollars in
2006, although it earned 950 million dollars in the fourth
quarter, its first quarterly profit in two years, thanks to a
major cost-cutting effort.
