Chinese share prices extended their record breaking performance
with a gain of 0.59 percent in Tuesday morning trade, supported
by sustained capital inflows as investors chased stocks, dealers
said.


They said some early profit-taking was quickly overcome as fresh
funds continued to pour into the market.


"The market saw significant fluctuations as some investors took
profits but fresh money continued entering to offset early
losses," said Wang Jun, an analyst at Merchants Securities.


Dealers cautioned that at these levels -- the market rose 130
percent last year and has ran ahead further so far in 2007 --
there is an increasing chance of a sharp pull-back as investors
take profits.


The market tumbled nearly 9.0 percent at the end of February,
sparking global equity turmoil, but has bounced back very
strongly to more than recoup the loss.


The market "is likely to see more corrections from now on as
stocks are relatively overbought in the short-term but the long-
term bullish trend will be maintained on largely-improved
corporate profitability," Wang said.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
up 21.90 points or 0.59 percent at 3,732.79, after touching an
intraday all-time high of 3,746.24.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 23.27 points or 0.60 percent at
3,923.22 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was up 10.64 points or
0.97 percent at 1,103.94, another record.
