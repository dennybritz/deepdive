The Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday kept key short-term
borrowing rates unchanged as it seeks to keep economic growth on
track despite inflation running well above its comfort zone.


The central bank has already raised short-term lending rates
twice this year, by a quarter of a percent each time, to 7.75
percent -- its highest level in more than four years to contain
inflation running above six percent.


The central bank aims for an annual inflation rate of 5.0 to 5.5
percent and said in a regular quarterly review that the earlier
rate hikes should help to being price rises down towards the
lower end of that range.


"In view of the lagged and cumulative effects of monetary policy
on aggregate demand, the policy would be to contain inflation
close to 5.0 percent," in the fiscal year started April 1,
central bank Governor Y.V. Reddy said in a statement.
