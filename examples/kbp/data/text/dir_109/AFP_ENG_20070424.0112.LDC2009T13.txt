Three men were shot dead by suspected Islamic rebels in
Thailand's restive south as the country's junta leader mulled
troop reinforcements in the restive region Tuesday.


A 50-year-old Buddhist was killed in a drive-by shooting Tuesday
in Yala, one of three Muslim-majority southern provinces
bordering Malaysia, police said.


Two other men were killed in drive-by shootings, one in Pattani
province and one in Narathiwat province.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in the three-year
southern unrest, with violence escalating in the last six months
despite peace efforts by the military-backed government, which
came to power after a September coup.


The junta leader, General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, told a local
paper that he was considering boosting the military presence in
the south in an effort to rein in the ongoing violence.


"I am considering sending more troops as reinforcements," Sonthi,
the first Muslim to head the mainly Buddhist Thai army, was
quoted by Matichon newspaper as saying.


He did not give details, and army officials could not be reached
for confirmation. Currently, the army says some 30,000 troops are
stationed in the three restive provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and
Pattani.


Sonthi also rejected a recommendation by a senior army official
that the government should grant amnesty to "militant
sympathisers" in an effort to ease the violence.


The three provinces were once an autonomous sultanate, until the
region was annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a century ago.
Separatist unrest has erupted periodically ever since.
