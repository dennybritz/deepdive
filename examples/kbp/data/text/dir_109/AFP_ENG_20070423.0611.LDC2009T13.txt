Chicago Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich was fined 25,000 dollars by the
National Basketball Association for throwing his mouthpiece
during Saturday's playoff game against the Miami Heat.


Hinrich was caught tossing his mouthguard into the stands with
11:01 remaining in the third quarter of the Bulls' 96-91 game one
win over the Heat at the United Center in Chicago.


Hinrich averaged 16.6 points and 35 1/2 minutes per game in 80
games this season. He struggled on Saturday, scoring just two
points in 19 minutes.
