Australia's consumer price index (CPI) in the three months to
March rose 0.1 percent from the previous quarter and was up 2.4
percent year-on-year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said
Tuesday.


The market consensus forecast was for a 0.6 percent quarter-on-
quarter rise and a 3.0 percent year-on-year increase.


The figures showed the annual rate of inflation was well within
the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2.0-3.0 percent target range,
reducing the chances of an interest rate hike next month.


The central bank holds its next policy meeting on May 1 to
determine whether to change its official cash rate from a current
level of 6.25 percent.
