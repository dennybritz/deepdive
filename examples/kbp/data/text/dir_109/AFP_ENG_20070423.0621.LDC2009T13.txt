Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday said former
Russian president Boris Yeltsin had earned his place in history
by saving his country's nascent democracy.


"I think he will be best remembered as the person who really
ultimately did save the arrival of democracy in Russia," Howard
told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.


"That momentous occasion when he stood on the tank outside the
Russian parliament and held back the counter-revolution ... by
the old guard of the former Soviet regime was an extraordinary
event," he said.


"He has a place in history as a result of that."


But the prime minister noted that Yeltsin had "lost a lot of
credibility" on economic issues after he became Russia's first
president, but said nothing could erase his contribution to
democracy in the country.


Yeltsin, the former president who brought down the Soviet Union
and led Russia through the traumatic transition to democracy and
capitalism, died Monday aged 76.
