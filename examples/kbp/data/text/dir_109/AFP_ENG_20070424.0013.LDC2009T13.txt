A suicide bomber has exploded his car near a US military patrol
base north of Baghdad killing nine soldiers and wounding 20
others, the military said Tuesday.


The attack took place in the restive Diyala province on Monday,
the military said.


One Iraqi civilian was also wounded in the bomb attack.


Fifteen of the wounded soldiers have returned to duty after
initial medical care, the military added.


The latest fatalities took the military's losses in Iraq to 70 in
this month alone and to 3,330 since the March 2003 invasion of
the country, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
