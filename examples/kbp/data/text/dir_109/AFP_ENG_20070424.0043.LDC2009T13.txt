A Philippines mayoral candidate survived a gangland-style ambush
Tuesday, as violence escalated in the run up to May elections,
police said.


Gunmen, believed to be political rivals, ambushed a two-car
convoy in the northern Abra province, some 350 kilometers (270
miles) north of Manila, but the target, Boyet Castillo, escaped
unhurt, police said.


Castillo, who is standing for mayor in the area, reported the
incident to police, who launched a search for the suspects.


Politicians in Abra, a landlocked province in the main island of
Luzon, are known to control private armed groups. It has been
placed under a watchlist by elections amid deadly rivalries
between rival candidates.


Last year, Abra congressman Luis Bersamin was gunned down outside
a church in Manila, in what police suspect was a political
vendetta. The case remains unsolved.


The Philippines will elect senators, congressmen and thousands of
local officials on May 14.
