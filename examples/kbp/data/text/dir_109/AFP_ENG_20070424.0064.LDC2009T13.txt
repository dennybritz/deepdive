Taiwan's AU Optronics on Tuesday reported a net loss of 5.11
billion Taiwan dollars (154 million US) for the first quarter of
2007, compared with a net profit of 1.66 billion in the previous
quarter.


The figures also compared with a net profit of 6.65 billion
dollars from the same period last year, said the world's third
biggest flat-panel maker.


Sales in the first quarter to March also dropped 14.72 percent to
80.72 billion dollars, it said.


AU Optronics said it expected a rebound in liquid crystal display
(LCD) panel prices and shipments from the second quarter due to
the improving supply-demand status in the market.


It said at a quarterly briefing to investors that shipments of
large-sized LCD panels in the second quarter were expected to
increase more than 10 percent from the first.
