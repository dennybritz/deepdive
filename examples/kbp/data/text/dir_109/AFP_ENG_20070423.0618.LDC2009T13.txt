A Japanese court is set to hand down a verdict on the killing of
British bar hostess Lucie Blackman on Tuesday, nearly seven years
after her death.


The Tokyo District Court will open the closely-watched trial at
10:00 am (0200 GMT) and is expected to soon render a judgement on
former property developer Joji Obara, a court official said.


Obara, now in his mid-50s, has pleaded innocent, arguing he did
not intend to kill Blackman. He is charged with abduction,
assaults resulting in death, mutilation and abandonment of a
corpse, but not actual murder.


Prosecutors are seeking the maximum life in prison.


Blackman, 21, disappeared in July 2000 while working as a hostess
in Tokyo's seedy Roppongi district, hoping to earn quick money to
fund a trip to Australia.


Obara allegedly lured a number of women back to his seaside
condominium where he drugged and then had videotaped sex with
them.


The murder triggered outrage in both countries, and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair personally raised the case during a visit to
Tokyo.


Memories of the Blackman case were revived last month after the
corpse of 22 -year-old British teacher Lindsay Ann Hawker was
found in suburban Tokyo.


Police are still trying to find suspect Tatsuya Ichihashi, 28,
who lived in an apartment where her bruised, naked body was found
buried in a sand-filled bathtub on the balcony.
