Otago Highlanders flanker Josh Blackie is joining the exodus of
high profile New Zealand rugby players after signing a two-year
contract with Japanese side Kobe Steel.


The 27-year-old loose forward is leaving after nine years of
being battered in first class rugby in New Zealand. Although he
never played for the All Blacks, he has been one of the most
respected New Zealand flankers in recent seasons.


"Japan will give my body a chance to regenerate and hopefully by
the time I'm 40, I'll still be able to run down the road,"
Blackie said Tuesday.


He has played 55 games for Super 14 side the Highlanders and 73
for provincial team Otago and believes his career is winding
down.


"While I'm not saying I'm washed up, I'm showing the initial
signs of it," he told the New Zealand Press Association.


"It's important to me that I leave New Zealand with a good
reputation of playing my best and not have to wait to be told
that I need to stop playing."


Blackie will play alongside former All Blacks forwards Ron Cribb
and Royce Willis at Kobe Steel.


His decision to move overseas follows close on the heels of
announcements by All Blacks Aaron Mauger, Byron Kelleher, Carl
Hayman and Chris Jack of moves to Europe after this year's World
Cup.


Other All Blacks are also expected to confirm they have been
lured to the northern hemisphere by high-paying clubs.
