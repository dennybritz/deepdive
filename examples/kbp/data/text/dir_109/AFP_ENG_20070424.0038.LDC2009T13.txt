A third tornado has hit Vietnam in less than two weeks, killing a
child, injuring 11 people and damaging or destroying 300 houses
in the country's far south, local officials said Tuesday.


The violent, unseasonal funnel-shaped storm hit the Tran Van Thoi
district of Ca Mau province Monday, leaving a trail of
destruction, after the previous storms had hit northern and
central regions.


"A 13-year-old primary school student was killed in this
whirlwind which totally or partially destroyed nearly 300
houses," Nguyen Long Hoai, head of the provincial flood and storm
control committee, told AFP.


"It was an unexpected storm of the kind which rarely happens at
the start of the summer raining season here."


Last week, a violent storm killed one man, destroyed 19 houses
and unroofed 300 in the northern province of Yen Bai.


On April 14 a tornado hit central Quang Nam province, injuring 21
people, collapsing 13 houses and leaving 400 buildings roofless
while also toppling trees and electrical poles.


Tornados and typhoons regularly hit Vietnam, but climate experts
warn that the nation, which has a 3,200-kilometre (2,000-mile)
coastline, must brace for more severe storms if global
temperatures rise.
