A Tokyo court Tuesday acquitted a Japanese businessman of all
charges relating to the murder of British bar hostess Lucie
Blackman, although he was sentenced to life for a series of other
crimes.


Joji Obara had been accused of her abduction, assaults resulting
in death, mutilation and abandonment of a corpse in Blackman's
case, but not her actual murder.


While the Blackman case was the most prominent, Obara had also
been accused of 10 counts of rape, including two which led to
death, and it was for these that he was sentenced.


The other woman who died was Australian bar hostess Carita
Ridgway.
