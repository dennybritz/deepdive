Pitcher Mark Prior will have exploratory arthroscopic surgery on
his right shoulder, the Chicago Cubs announced on Monday.


The injury-prone righthander, once among the top power pitchers
in Major League Baseball, has been plagued by a litany of
injuries over the past three seasons.


The injuries have limited Prior to a total of 57 starts over that
stretch - including just nine last year.


The righthander entered spring training vying for the fifth spot
in Chicago's rotation but struggled in limited action, going 0-2
with a 6.97 ERA before being optioned to the minors on March 28.


Selected second overall in 2001, Prior made 19 starts with the
Cubs that season before emerging as an ace in the following
campaign, going 18-6 with a 2.43 ERA and 245 strikeouts.


But the hard-throwing Prior has not been able to stay healthy
since his All-Star season in 2003, logging a total of just 329
innings over the last three campaigns.
