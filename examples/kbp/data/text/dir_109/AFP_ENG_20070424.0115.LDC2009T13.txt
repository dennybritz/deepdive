Six men were arrested in and around London on Tuesday in a series
of anti-terror raids, police said.


"Six men have been arrested in connection with inciting others to
commit acts of terrorism overseas and terrorist fundraising," a
Metropolitan Police spokesman told AFP.


"The men were arrested this morning at five addresses in London
and one in Luton," a town north of the capital.


"A number of searches are ongoing."


The men were arrested by the Metropolitan Police Counter
Terrorism Command and local police officers.


A police spokesman said: "The arrests form part of a long-term
pro-active and complex investigation into alleged incitement and
radicalisation for the purposes of terrorism, as well as alleged
provision of financial support for international terrorism."


They were taken to the high-security Paddington Green police
station in central London, Sky News television reported.


The arrests were in connection with an incident in November 2004,
the broadcaster said, but gave further details. It said the raids
in London took place in Southall in the west of the city and
Bethnal Green, Leyton, Poplar in the east.
