A Japanese court on Tuesday sentenced a businessman accused in
the death of British bar hostess Lucie Blackman to life in prison
for a series of crimes against women.


The Tokyo District Court handed the life sentence to 54-year-old
former property developer Joji Obara at the close of a marathon
trial that opened in December 2000.


Obara was accused of 10 counts of rape including the deaths of
two 21-year-old Western women, Blackman and Australian bar
hostess Carita Ridgway, although he was not charged with actual
murder.


Blackman disappeared in July 2000 while working as a hostess in
Tokyo. Her dismembered body was found seven months later in a
seaside cave.
