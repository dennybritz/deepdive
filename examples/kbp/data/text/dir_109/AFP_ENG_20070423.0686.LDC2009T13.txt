An Indonesian court found US mining giant Newmont not guilty
Tuesday of polluting a bay with toxins from a now defunct gold
mine.


"The water of Buyat Bay was not contaminated with the tailings
from PT Newmont," the court ruled, referring to Newmont's
Indonesian subsidiary.


The judge was still reading the decision to the Manado provincial
court on whether Newmont executive Richard Ness was guilty of
polluting the bay on Sulawesi island.
