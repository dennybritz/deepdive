Six people were arrested in and around the British capital on
Tuesday in a series of anti-terror raids, police said.


The suspects were arrested by London's Metropolitan Police --
five in London and one in Luton, north of the city, Sky News
television said.


They were taken to the high-security Paddington Green police
station in central London, it added.


The arrests are in connection with an incident in November 2004,
the broadcaster said.
