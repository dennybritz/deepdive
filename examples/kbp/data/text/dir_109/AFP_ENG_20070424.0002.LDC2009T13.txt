Dutch legend Phillip Cocu has confirmed he is considering an
offer to join Sydney FC next season as their marquee player to
replace Dwight Yorke.


The 36-year midfielder, currently playing for PSV Eindhoven
alongside Jason Culina, the son of Sydney coach Branko Culina,
told the Sydney Morning Herald his agent Rob Jansen was in talks.


"It's true there has been contact with my agent but at this stage
I'm not sure what I am going to do," said Cocu, who retired from
international football after the World Cup last year.


"There are other options, I have other offers," he said.


Culina was Monday appointed as Sydney coach full-time after
operating on an interim basis following the departure of former
England star Terry Butcher.


He made it clear he plans to help Sydney take their place at the
summit of Australian football.


"The aim now is to raise the bar. Everyone knows what is expected
of this club, no one needs to tell us," said Culina.


Former England international Teddy Sheringham has also been
mentioned as a possible Sydney recruit since Yorke left last
August to join English Championship side Sunderland.
