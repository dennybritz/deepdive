Two more car bombs exploded Tuesday in a Baghdad parking lot
outside the Iranian embassy and several Iraqi government
buildings, one day after two detonated in the same place.


Police at the scene said that no-one was hurt in the blast, but
that they were searching for another suspected bomb. Several
civilian vehicles were damaged in the blasts and a fierce fire
engulfed the bombed-out car.


The unprotected parking area on Zabidur Street is used by workers
and visitors to several Iraqi ministries and to the Iranian
embassy, which is protected behind blast walls 50 yards (metres)
away.


The area -- which is a short distance from the fortified Green
Zone -- is also used as a staging post for Iraqi police patrols,
and Tuesday's double blasts went off as an Iraqi military convoy
was passing.


One person was injured in the first of Monday's explosions.
