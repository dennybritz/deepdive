French food group Danone said first-quarter sales in 2007
totalled 3.673 billion euros (4.983 dollars), up 3.9 percent from
3.534 billion euros a year earlier, and up 10.1 percent on a
like-for-like basis.


On the basis of these results, Danone reiterated its full-year
targets of 6-8 percent sales growth, 7-10 percent growth in
operating income and a 10 percent improvement in underlying
earnings per share.


Danone also said it expected its operating margin to rise by at
least 20 basis points over the full year, repeating forecasts
given earlier in the year.
