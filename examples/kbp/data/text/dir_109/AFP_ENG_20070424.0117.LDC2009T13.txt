The main suspect in the murder of a US Peace Corps volunteer in
the Philippines has continued to evade authorities, a police
spokesman said Tuesday.


Juan Dontugan, 25, a woodcarver from the northern mountain town
of Batad, has not been found by police who wish to question him
over the death of Julia Campbell.


Campbell, 40, was found buried in a shallow grave outside Batad
on April 18 after going missing while hiking in the area. Police
say she was beaten to death.


Dontugan, whose wife is the owner of a store where Campbell was
last seen alive, is not yet in police custody, Chief
Superintendent Samuel Pagdilao said.


"We have no sufficient evidence to convict Dontugan of the crime.
We are looking for him to question him and so he can explain
himself," added Pagdilao.


However police have found a bloody pair of trousers at the
suspect's home and have sent these to a crime laboratory in
Manila.


Three witnesses said that they saw Dontugan near where Campbell's
body was found, Pagdilao said.


But police are not ruling out the possibility that there may be
more than one killer.


The police are requesting that relatives of the suspect find
Dontugan.


Officers say that robbery was the most likely motive for the
crime.
