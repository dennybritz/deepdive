Phoenix Suns guard Leandro Barbosa easily captured the National
Basketball Association's Sixth Man Award on Monday.


The announcement came one day after Brazil's Barbosa scored 15 of
his 26 points in a five-minute stretch of the second half to help
the Suns rally for a 95-87 home victory over the Los Angeles
Lakers in the opener of their Western Conference first-round
series.


The performance came after balloting among media members had been
tabulated but served as a reminder of what Barbosa had done all
season for the Suns, who led the NBA in scoring at 110.2 points
per game.


The result spoke volumes of the perception of Barbosa, who
received 578 total points and 101 of a possible 127 first-place
votes to easily beat San Antonio's Manu Ginobili. He also
received 24 second-place votes and one third-place vote from a
panel of 127 sportswriters and broadcasters.


Barbosa became the fourth Sun to win the award, joining Eddie
Johnson (1989), Danny Manning (1998) and Rodney Rogers (2000).


Barbosa averaged 18.1 points in 80 games this season. In 62
contests as a reserve, he averaged 17.6 points in 30.8 minutes.
