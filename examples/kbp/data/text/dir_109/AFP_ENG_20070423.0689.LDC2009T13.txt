An Indonesian court found US mining giant Newmont and one of its
executives not guilty Tuesday of polluting a bay with toxins from
a now defunct gold mine.


"The water of Buyat Bay was not contaminated with the tailings
from PT Newmont," the court ruled, referring to Newmont's
Indonesian subsidiary.


"The defendant (executive Richard Ness) is free from the charges
of causing pollution and environmental damage," the court also
said.


Both verdicts were greeted with applause inside the court.
