Democrats in Congress merged House and Senate versions of an
emergency spending bill for Iraq, including a time line to
withdraw US troops, despite a veto threat by US President George
W. Bush.


The bill calls for withdrawal of most US combat forces beginning
no later than October 1, 2007, with a non-binding goal for
completing the pullout by April 1, 2008.


Lawmakers said their bill reflects the wishes of the US public to
leave Iraq sooner rather than later.


"The legislation reflects the will of the American people and the
best interests of our nation," said Senate Appropriations
Committee chairman Robert Byrd.


"This legislation fully funds our brave troops, who risk their
lives every day serving our country," said Byrd, a longtime Iraq
war critic.


He said the bill "also demands a long-overdue change in direction
from the president's failing policy in Iraq."


The legislation also provides funding for troop and veteran
health care, and recovery of the hurricane-ravaged US Gulf Coast.
