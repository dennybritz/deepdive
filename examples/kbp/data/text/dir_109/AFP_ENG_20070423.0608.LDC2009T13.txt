New York Yankees outfielder Hideki Matsui was activated from the
15-day disabled list on Monday.


Matsui, who had been sidelined with a strained left hamstring
since April 7, will start in left field and bat sixth against the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays.


Matsui, 32, missed four months last season after breaking his
left wrist on May 11.


The Japanese left fielder had played in 518 consecutive games
with the Yankees before suffering the wrist injury.


A two-time All-Star, Matsui lasted just four games this season
before once again landing on the disabled list.


He suffered the hamstring strain while running out a ground ball
in the second inning of a contest against the Baltimore Orioles
on April 7.


Matsui is batting .250 (three-for-12) with three RBI this season.


The news of his return could not come at a better time for the
Yankees, who are reeling after suffering a three-game series
sweep this past weekend to the rival Boston Red Sox.
