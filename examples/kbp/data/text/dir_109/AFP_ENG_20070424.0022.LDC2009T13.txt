Immigration authorities said Tuesday they have arrested a Kyrgyz
woman and are hunting 18 of her compatriots who entered South
Korea by pretending to be a shooting team from the Central Asian
nation.


The immigration office in the southeastern city of Masan said 28
-year-old Ainura Temiralieva and 18 others arrived in the country
on April 10.


They were bused to a hotel in Changwon where the World Cup
International Shooting Sport Federation competition was held from
April 14 to 23, with more than 50 countries taking part.


But the supposed Kyrgyz team vanished upon arrival at the hotel.


An organiser of the event said he believed they were a genuine
Kyrgyz shooting squad until he checked with the country's
shooting federation authorities.


"I was just appalled when I received an e-mail from the Kyrgyz
federation which said the 19 people were not their athletes,"
said Chung Bum-Sik, director for international affairs of the
Korea Shooting Federation.


He told AFP a man who claimed to be the director of the Kyrgyz
shooting federation had contacted tournament organisers through
e-mails and used an address similar to that of the real director.


Temiralieva was detained at Incheon airport on Monday but 18
others were still at large, the immigration office said.


"I think they are working as illegals somewhere in this country,"
an official said.
