China expressed condolences Tuesday on the death of former
Russian president Boris Yeltsin, calling him a "friend of the
Chinese people" and praising him for contributing to bilateral
ties.


"We express our deep condolences on the passing away of Mr
Yeltsin," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said.


"He was a sincere friend of the Chinese people... who made
prominent contributions to the development of our bilateral
ties."


During his tenure, Yeltsin established a strategic partnership
with China and helped resolve a long-standing border dispute, Liu
said.


Yeltsin, the former president who brought down the Soviet Union
and led Russia through the traumatic transition to democracy and
capitalism, died Monday aged 76.
