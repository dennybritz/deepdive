Mount Everest conqueror Sir Edmund Hillary was recovering in
hospital Tuesday, his wife said, after a report he had suffered a
fall.


His wife June did not comment on why the 87-year-old mountaineer
and explorer had been hospitalised, in a short statement issued
on her behalf by Auckland Hospital.


Hillary was admitted to the hospital on Sunday after returning
from Kathmandu in Nepal.


"He is in a comfortable condition and improves daily," his wife
said.


An Auckland Hospital spokeswoman said there would be no further
comment about Hillary's condition and she would not confirm he
had been hurt in a fall, as reported on the New Zealand Herald
newspaper website.


New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said everyone in the
country would be wishing Hillary well.


"Sir Ed is a national icon, there is no one we love more and I
think the message from everyone of us is 'hang in there Ed, we
love you'," Clark said on Radio New Zealand.


Hillary, who with Sherpa Tenzing was the first to reach the peak
of 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) Everest in 1953, has been in
increasingly frail health in recent years.


But that did not stop him visiting Nepal this month or returning
to Antarctica in January, where he led a mission 49 years ago.
