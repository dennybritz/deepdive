Indonesian judges started reading their verdict Tuesday on
whether US mining giant Newmont polluted a bay on Sulawesi island
with toxins from a now defunct gold mine.


Five judges are tasked with deciding whether Newmont and one of
its executives polluted Buyat Bay, in a case closely watched by
foreign investors, environmentalists and governments.


Company executive Richard Ness faces three years in jail if
convicted, while the Indonesian unit of Newmont could be fined.


The verdict comes after a 20-month high-profile trial.


Head judge Ridwan Damanik began reading his statement a bit after
0100 GMT in the provincial court in the town of Manado on
Sulawesi, meaning the verdict was now expected before 0400 GMT.
