Injured Everton and Australia midfielder Tim Cahill is targetting
a return to action at the Asian Cup finals in July, but admits it
is still touch and go.


Cahill, a key member of the Socceroos, fractured a metatarsal in
his left foot against Sheffield United in early March and has
been on the sidelines ever since.


But he said the bone was on the mend and he was desperate to
return.


"I will be doing all I can to be fit and available for
selection," Cahill told the Everton website.


"The competition starts in July so it is going to be very tricky
on the schedule but the Asian Cup is a massive competition.


"It is something we have got a realistic chance of being in the
top contenders to win it, so from Australia'a perspective,
following the World Cup successes, we need our strongest team
possible."


Having started just 19 times for Everton this season, Cahill
admits he can't wait to get back on the pitch.


"I am gagging to get back into football," said the former
Millwall player.


"It is just frustrating because I couldn't do anything about my
first injury and then I came back and had a freak accident."


Australia are in a Bangkok-based pool that also includes
Thailand, Oman and Iraq for the Asian Cup, with their first game
against Oman on July 8.


They play warm-up matches against Uruguay on June 2 and Singapore
on June 30.
