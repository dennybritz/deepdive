Foreign antique smugglers equipped with advanced technology are
plundering Chinese relics from the thousands of old shipwrecks
along the country's coast, state media reported on Tuesday.


Financed by international black market sales of the mostly blue
and white priceless porcelain relics, the wreck-raiders are using
sophisticated equipment beyond the reach of Chinese
archaeologists, the China Daily reported Tuesday, citing an
official with the State Administration of Cultural Heritage.


The booty is then traded on overseas markets, with much of it
making its way to the United States, the report said.


"We want more international help in the protection and recovery
of China's cultural heritage and we'd like to sign bilateral
agreements with more countries," said Shan Jixiang, director of
the administration.


He said China had signed agreements with just four countries --
India, Italy, Peru and the Philippines.


The smuggling has increased since 2005, when about 15,000 pieces
of porcelain were recovered from a 300-year-old wreck in 13.5
metres (44 feet) of water off the coast of eastern China's Fujian
province, the report said.


The Chinese government has recovered a "great number" of cultural
heritage items stolen from the country in the past few decades,
Shan said without elaborating.
