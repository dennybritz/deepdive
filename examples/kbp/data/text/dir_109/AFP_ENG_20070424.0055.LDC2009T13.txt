The armed wing of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement on
Tuesday said it had fired dozens of projectiles into Israel as
the Jewish state marked its 59th anniversary.


In a statement released in Gaza, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades
said they had fired nearly 30 rockets and 61 mortars into the
Jewish state as it marked its Independence Day "to avenge the
assassinations committed by the enemy."


An army spokesman said that two rockets and eight mortar shells
landed inside Israel, without causing injuries.


The Israeli army dropped fliers in northern Gaza on Monday,
warning of a major incursion into the territory if the rocket
fire did not cease within 48 hours, witnesses said.


The armed wing of the Hamas movement, the senior partner in the
Palestinian coalition cabinet installed on March 17, has so far
largely abided by a November 26 ceasefire between Gaza militants
and the Israeli army.


But after Israeli troops killed nine Palestinians, including two
teenagers and militants, in Gaza and the occupied West Bank over
the weekend -- the bloodiest two days of Israeli-Palestinian
violence since the truce -- calls mounted for armed groups to
break the ceasefire.


"We call on Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades (the armed wing of Hamas)
and all other Palestinian resistance factions to unite and use
all means to respond to the massacres of the occupation," Hamas
spokesman Fawzi Barhum said on Sunday.
