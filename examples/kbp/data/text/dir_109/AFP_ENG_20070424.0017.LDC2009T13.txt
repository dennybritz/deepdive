Two more people have been confirmed dead from a landslide on a
construction site in northern China, bringing the death toll to
11, state press reported.


Of the 13 people originally buried, one remains missing while the
only survivor pulled from the accident is out of danger after
being treated, Xinhua news agency reported late Monday, citing a
local official.


The accident occurred Sunday in Hejin city in Shanxi province,
where excessive coal mining has severely weakened the ground,
causing large cracks in the earth, state media reports have said.


The landslide also destroyed a local school building and
partially buried an adjacent village committee office building,
the report said.


Rescue efforts were still underway as of late Monday to try to
dig out the last missing worker at the scene in Banpo village,
Xinhua said.
