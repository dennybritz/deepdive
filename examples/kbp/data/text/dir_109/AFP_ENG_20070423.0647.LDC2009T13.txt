Japan's Toshiba Corp. is expected to have made a record net
profit of 135 billion yen (1.1 billion dollars) for the fiscal
year to March 31, a newspaper said Tuesday.


The profit gain, up 73 percent from the previous year, was due
largely to 55 billion yen in capital gains from the sale of
shareholdings in group firms, the Nikkei business daily reported,
without citing sources.


It will be the electronic giant's highest profit in 17 years, the
daily said.


Revenue increased 12 percent to 7.1 trillion yen, thanks to brisk
performance in its social infrastructure and other segments which
offset a decline in prices of flash memories, the newspaper said.


Operating profit rose six percent to some 255 billion yen, with
the chip business seen accounting for some 130 billion yen, it
said.


For the new fiscal year ending March 2008, Toshiba's operating
profit is seen edging up to about 260 billion yen, the Nikkei
said.


In January, Toshiba raised its full year outlook on the back of
the strong nine- month performance, expecting net profits of 120
billion yen up from an earlier projection of 110 billion.


It also boosted its sales forecast to 7.0 trillion yen from 6.75
trillion previously.


Toshiba is to announce corporate results for the fiscal year to
March 2007 on Thursday.
