A Saudi man was beheaded by the sword in the southern city of
Jazan on Tuesday after he was convicted of murdering a
compatriot, the interior ministry said.


Mohammad bin Jaber Abu Shaafa was found guilty of stabbing Mussa
bin Hussein Haqwi to death during a fight sparked by a land
dispute, the ministry said in a statement carried by the official
SPA news agency.


The latest beheading brings to 40 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia,
or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
