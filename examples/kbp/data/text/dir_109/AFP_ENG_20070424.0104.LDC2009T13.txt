KKR, the US private equity group battling to buy Alliance Boots,
Europe's biggest pharmacy chain, has raised its bid to 11.01
billion pounds (16.2 billion euro, 22.0 billion dollars), a
statement said Tuesday.


Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which is joined in its bid by the
executive deputy chairman of Alliance Boots, Stefano Pessina, has
raised its offer by 4.5 percent to 1,139 pence per Alliance Boots
share.


Alliance Boots had Friday accepted KKR's bid of 10.6 billion
pounds. But faced with a higher rival bid from British private
equity firm Terra Firma worth 10.78 billion pounds, KKR has moved
to increase its own offer.
