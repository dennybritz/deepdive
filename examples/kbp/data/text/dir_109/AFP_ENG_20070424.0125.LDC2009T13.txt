An EU court shot down The Netherlands' so-called 'open skies'
aviation accord with the United States on Tuesday, ruling it was
illegal because such pacts should be between the EU and the US.


The European Commission brought the case before the court in 2004
on the grounds that an EU member could not have such a bilateral
deal because it could give its carriers an unfair advantage over
other members' airlines.


The ruling makes The Netherlands the ninth EU country to have
such a bilateral aviation accord with the United States deemed to
be illegal.


Earlier this year, the European Commission negotiated a landmark
EU-US open skies agreement, which is aimed in part at removing
the patchwork of existing bilateral accords with the United
States.


That agreement is supposed to go into effect at the end of March
2008.
