President Hugo Chavez confessed Monday his heart lies with
Socialist Segolene Royal, battling to become France's first
female president, against rightist Nicolas Sarkozy.


"We have not met, but (as a) woman and socialist, our heart is
with her," Chavez said.


Chavez also repeated his affection for French President Jacques
Chirac, calling him "a good friend" of Venezuela in difficult
times.


"I invited him here for a retreat. I hope he visits one day," he
said.


Sarkozy won 31.18 percent of Sunday's vote ahead of Royal on
25.97 percent, according to final official figures. Turnout was a
near-record 83.77 percent.
