Pulitzer prize-winning author and journalist David Halberstam was
killed in a car accident in northern California on Monday, local
coroners said.


Halberstam, 73, most famous for his epic 1972 account of the
origins of the Vietnam War "The Best and The Brightest," died
after a car crash in Menlo Park, the San Mateo County Coroner's
Office told AFP.


Local reports said Halberstam died of internal injuries at the
scene after the car in which he was travelling collided with
another vehicle.


Reports said the New York-based Halberstam was working on a book
about the Korean War at the time of his death.
