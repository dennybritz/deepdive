The Texas Rangers on Monday placed righthanded closer Eric Gagne
on the 15-day disabled list with a right hip strain.


The Major League Baseball Cy Young Award winner in 2003, Gagne
suffered the injury in the ninth inning of Sunday's 4-3 victory
over the Oakland Athletics.


He limped off the mound after throwing 11 pitches to two batters.
Akinori Otsuka recorded the final two outs for the save.


Gagne, 31, has been ravaged by a litany of injuries over his
career to his shoulder, elbow and back, pitching in only 16 games
over the last two seasons.


He is 0-0 without a run allowed in 3 1/3 innings in four
appearances, including one save, this season.


Gagne has recorded 161 lifetime saves - including a career-high
55 in 2003, when he posted a 1.20 ERA in 77 games with the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
