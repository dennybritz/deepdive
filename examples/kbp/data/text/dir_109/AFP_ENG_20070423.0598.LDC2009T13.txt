Annika Sorenstam, who is sidelined with a back injury, was
replaced atop the world rankings on Monday by rising star Lorena
Ochoa of Mexico.


Even though an LPGA event was not played last weekend, Ochoa took
over the top spot with a points average of 12.84 from 50 events.


Resting at least until the end of the month with a ruptured disc
in her back, Sorenstam is second with an average of 12.74.


Sorenstam had been No. 1 since the rankings were first introduced
in February 2006.


The rankings are adjusted on a rolling two-year calendar with
each player's points total divided by the number of tournaments
played.


Ochoa, who has two wins and a second in six events this year,
tops the money list with 584,870 dollars.


The Mexican native won six titles in 2006, finishing with more
than 2.5 million dollars in earnings en route to being named
Player of the Year.


Sorenstam has two top-10 finishes in three events this year. The
Swede won three times last year.


A 69-time winner on the LPGA Tour, Sorenstam opened a new golf
academy last weekend in Florida.
