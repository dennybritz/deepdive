The armed wing of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement on
Tuesday said a five-month truce with the Israeli army "no longer
exists" after it fired dozens of rockets into the Jewish state.


The statement came after the the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said
it had fired nearly 30 rockets and 61 mortars into Israel as the
Jewish state marked its 59th anniversary.


It marked the first time that Hamas, the senior partner in the
Palestinian coalition cabinet, claimed responsibility for
launching rockets into Israel since a November 26 ceasefire took
effect between the army and Gaza militants.
