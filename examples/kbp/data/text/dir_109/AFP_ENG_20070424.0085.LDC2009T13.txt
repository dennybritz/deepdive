Richemont, the world's second-biggest luxury goods group, said
Tuesday that its annual sales had risen 12 percent to 4.83
billion euros (6.54 million dollars) as strong demand continued
into 2007.


Richemont said in a statement on its financial year ending March
31 that its unaudited sales figures showed double-digit growth in
all regions of the world, led by Asia with growth of 19 percent.


Sales of the group's watch, jewellery, luxury pen, leather and
fashion brands in Asia grew at a faster rate in the first three
months of 2007, it added.


Annual sales in Europe, which represents 42 percent of the
group's business, grew 13 percent.


The unaudited annual sales figure was slightly below analysts'
expectations of 4.86 billion euros for the 2006-2007 financial
year.


Richemont said its underlying growth was offset by the weakness
of the Japanese yen and the US dollar.


Full company results are due to be released on May 24.


Richemont, a holding company controlled by the South African
Rupert family, owns some of the world's most prestigious luxury
brand names, ranging from Cartier, Piaget and Van Cleef to
Dunhill, Lancel and Montblanc.
