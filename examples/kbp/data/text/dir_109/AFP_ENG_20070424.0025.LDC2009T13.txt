Hong Kong share prices finished the Tuesday morning session 0.27
percent higher as a rebound in China Mobile helped the market
recover from an early decline driven by Wall Street, dealers
said.


They said China Mobile attracted buying interest when its price
dropped below 72.0 Hong Kong dollars (9.2 US), with investors
beginning to take a longer-term view of its growth prospects
after digesting a disappointing first quarter performance.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 55.20 points at
20,611.77, off a low of 20,396.37 and a high of 20,618.01.
