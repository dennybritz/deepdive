Two more bombs exploded Tuesday in a Baghdad parking lot outside
the Iranian embassy and several Iraqi government buildings, one
day after two detonated in the same place.


The unprotected parking area on Zabidur Street is used by workers
and visitors to Iraq's defence ministry and to the Iranian
embassy, which is protected behind blast walls 50 yards (metres)
away.


The area -- which is a short distance from the fortified Greeen
Zone -- is also used as a staging post for Iraqi police patrols,
and Tuesday's double blasts went off as an Iraqi military convoy
was passing.


One person was injured in the first of Monday's explosions. It
was not immediately known if anyone was hurt in Tuesday's follow-
up attack.
