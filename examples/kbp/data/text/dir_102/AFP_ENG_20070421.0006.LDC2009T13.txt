Three coal miners were rescued in China Saturday after spending
almost five days at the bottom of a flooded mine, Xinhua
reported.


The three were taken to hospital in a weakened state after
rescuers found them on Saturday morning, the agency reported,
citing official sources.


Five bodies have been recovered and four of the 31 miners working
in the mine when it flooded are still missing. Nineteen escaped
the tragedy, at a privately run mine in Hunan province Monday.


Authorities confirmed Saturday that nine miners were killed and
said 19 were still missing after two coal mine accidents this
week in northern Hebei province.


In all, 80 miners are dead or missing in a series of disasters in
China since the start of the week.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


However, independent labour groups put the death toll at as many
as 20,000 annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid fines and closure.


Safety standards are routinely ignored in the race to meet
soaring demand in a country that relies on coal for around 70
percent of its energy needs.
