An Iranian man convicted of drug trafficking has been hanged in
the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province, a press report said
on Saturday.


Ghader Radsar was hanged in a prison in the city of Zahedan on
Thursday for carrying 12 kilos (26 pounds) of heroin, a report in
the hardline Kayhan newspaper said.


The hanging brings to at least 43 the number of executions in
Iran this year. At least 154 people were executed in 2006,
according to an AFP tally based on press and witness reports.


Capital offences in the Islamic republic include murder, rape,
armed robbery, apostasy, blasphemy, serious drug trafficking,
repeated sodomy, adultery or prostitution, treason and espionage.
