A gunman killed a male hostage and himself at NASA's Johnson
Space Center in Texas Friday, police said.


A second hostage was found unharmed but bound with duct tape,
police said.


"The suspect shot himself one time to the head. He appears to be
deceased at this time," Houston police captain Dwayne Ready said
at a press conference.


"Also on the same floor, there was one other hostage that was
shot. We believe that may have occurred in the early minutes of
this whole ordeal. And another hostage that was unharmed (was
found) taped, but unharmed and being looked at by our
paramedics."
