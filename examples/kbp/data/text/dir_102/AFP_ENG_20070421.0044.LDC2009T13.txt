Nigerian police said they had foiled an attack on the electoral
commission's offices in the federal capital on Saturday just
hours before the country goes to the polls in a landmark
presidential election.


"There was an attempt to burn down the electoral commission's
office this morning around 4 am (0300 GMT). A fuel tanker fully
loaded with petrol was seen moving towards the office and there
was no one inside", police spokesman Haz Iwendi told AFP.


Had the lorry hit its target "it would have been destruction on
the highest scale", Iwendi said, adding that a stone had been
placed behind the lorry's accelerator to keep it rolling towards
the commission's offices in the federal capital, Abuja.


Tensions are high in Nigeria ahead of Saturday's polls which come
a week after regional elections were marred by violence and
unrest.
