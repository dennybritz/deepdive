Large foreign firms working in Libya's oil industry have had to
change their names to new ones reflecting the country's history
and geography, the National Oil Corporation said on Saturday.


"Libya holds the majority of the shares in the local subsidiaries
of these companies, so it was fitting that they on take names
reflecting national symbols," NOC president Shukri Ghanem said.


France's Total has become "Mabruk Oil," the word Mabruk, which
means "congratulations" in Arabic, being a popular boy's name in
Libya.


Repsol of Spain becomes "Akakoss Petroleum Operations" -- a
reference to the Akakoss mountains in the south of the country --
while the Italian natural gas firm ENI has opted for "Mellita
Gas," named after the region where it operates west of Tripoli.


Germany's Veba has chosen "Al-Harruj Petroleum Operations" after
another southern Libyan mountain range.


The new names, which will be used in all contracts, "have been
approved and the registration formalities completed," according
to NOC officials.


Libya is the African continent's second largest oil producer at
1.7 million barrels per day. It also has natural gas reserves
estimated at 1,314 billion cubic metres.
