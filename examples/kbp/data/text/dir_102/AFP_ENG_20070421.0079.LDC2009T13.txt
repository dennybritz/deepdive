Four soldiers were killed Saturday when a 10-kilogram (22-pound)
roadside bomb exploded under their Humvee in Thailand's restive
Muslim-majority south, police said.


The bomb was set off by a remote control in Pattani, one of three
insurgency- torn southern provinces bordering Malaysia, they
said, adding the vehicle carrying the four soldiers was totally
destroyed in the blast.


Two soldiers died soon after the attack and two others died later
in hospital, police said.


The bomb blast came just a day after Thailand's army-backed Prime
Minister Surayud Chulanont, a former general, made a one-day
visit to the troubled region where more than 2,100 people have
been killed in three years of unrest.


Despite Surayud's peace efforts, including an apology to Muslims
for past abuses, near-daily shootings and bomb attacks continue
to rock the region.


Major General Chamlong Khunsong, the army chief of staff in the
south, acknowledged that violence had escalated in recent months,
but stressed that the government was getting more cooperation
from local Muslims.


"Militants are stepping up violence because more and more
villagers are supporting and cooperating with the government,"
Chamlong told AFP.


The three Muslim-majority provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and
Pattani were once an autonomous sultanate, until the region was
annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a century ago. Separatist
unrest has erupted periodically ever since.
