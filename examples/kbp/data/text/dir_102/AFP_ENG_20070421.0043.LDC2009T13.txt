A Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire during an army operation
in the northern West Bank on Saturday, sources on both sides
said.


Mohammed Abed, a 23-year-old policeman, was hit as he watched
from a window of his home near the town of Jenin, Palestinian
medical and security sources said.


The Israeli military insisted that Abed had been armed.


"During an operation near Jenin, a makeshift bomb was thrown at
the troops and they spotted a Palestinian on a roof with a rifle
and fired in his direction and hit him," a spokesman said.


The death brought to 5,661 the overall toll since the eruption of
the current Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the vast
majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP count.
