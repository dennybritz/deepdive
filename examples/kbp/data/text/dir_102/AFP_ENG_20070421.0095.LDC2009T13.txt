Cameroon's President Paul Biya has set the date of July 22 for
the first round of legislative and municipal elections in the
west African nation, national radio reported Saturday.


The presidential decree did not announce the date for the second
round of the elections, which will choose lawmakers and municipal
officials for a five-year term.


In the 2002 vote, the president's party, the Rally of the
Cameroonian People (RDPC), won an overwhelming majority of 149
out of the 180 seats in the National Assembly.


The main opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF) led
by John Fru Ndi, garnered 22 seats.


Biya, who has been in power since 1982, was last re-elected in
October 2004 with 71 percent of the vote for a seven-year term.
