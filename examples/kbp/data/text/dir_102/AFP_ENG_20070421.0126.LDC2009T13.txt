Iraq Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday told visiting
Australian Defence Minister Brenden Nelson that the Baghdad
security plan was going in the right direction despite
challenges.


A number of high-profile car bombings killed more than 200 people
this week in Baghdad where some 80,000 Iraqi and US troops are
implementing a security plan on the capital's mean streets.


"The security plan currently in action is going in the right
direction despite the challenges," Maliki told Nelson, who made a
surprise visit to Baghdad on Saturday.


Nelson's visit comes a day after US Defence Secretary Robert
Gates wound up a two-day trip to check on the progress of the
crackdown.


A statement from Maliki's office said Nelson pledged Australia's
"full support" for the Iraqi government, particularly in
developing the country's dilapidated infrastructure.


"Our country is intent to play a bigger role in the
reconstruction drive that is currently on in Iraq," the statement
quoted Nelson as saying.


Australia has around 1,400 troops in Iraq, of which 550 are
combat troops and largely deployed in the south alongside British
forces.
