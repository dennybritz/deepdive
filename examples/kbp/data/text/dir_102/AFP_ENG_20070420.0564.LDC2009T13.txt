The New York Islanders, battling to stay alive in the National
Hockey League playoffs, lost defenseman Sean Hill for 20 games
Friday following a 20-game doping ban.


Hill was suspended 20 games without pay by the NHL for violating
the terms of the Performance Enhancing Substances Program run by
both the league and the Players' Association.


The suspension was to begin with game five of the Islanders'
Eastern Conference first-round series against the Buffalo Sabres
on Friday night.


The Islanders went into the contest trailing 3-1 in the best-of-
seven series.


Hill, a free agent at the conclusion of the postseason, will be
required to serve whatever portion of the ban remains following
the playoffs during the 2007-08 campaign.


Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, the 37
-year-old Hill also will be referred to the NHL/NHLPA Program for
Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health for evaluation and
treatment if deemed necessary.


A 1988 eighth-round pick of Montreal, Hill recorded one goal and
24 assists while averaging just over 22 1/2 minutes of ice time
in 81 games for New York this season.


The Minnesota native played an average of 18 1/2 minutes in each
of the Islanders' first four postseason contests but did not
register a point.
