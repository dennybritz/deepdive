The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average share index struck a
record finish for the third straight day in row Friday, surging
1.2 percent to an all-time closing high of 12,962.79.


The Dow flirted close to the key level of 13,000 points as
investors cheered a flurry of upbeat profit reports from
corporate America.


The blue-chip index had struck a record closing high of 12,808.63
points on Thursday.


The tech-rich Nasdaq composite meanwhile leapt 21.04 points (0.84
percent) at 2,526.39 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's
ended 13.66 points (0.93) percent higher at a preliminary close
of 1,484.39.


A strong profit report from Internet search giant Google late
Thursday and solid earnings performances from pharmaceutical
heavyweight Pfizer and McDonald's on Friday helped boost investor
sentiment.
