Three bodies were found in a car filled with carbon monoxide in
what appeared to be Japan's latest group suicide, police said
Saturday, the second such incident this week.


Bodies of two men and one woman were found Friday evening in a
vehicle in a carpark in Mishima, a city in Shizuoka prefecture
some 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of Tokyo, police said.


"There were three charcoal burners inside the car, and a note was
also found that said 'I want to die'," local police spokesman
Iwao Irie said by telephone.


Police confirmed that one man was a 30-year-old from Kawasaki
near Tokyo.


"We are investigating identities of the other two, both seemingly
aged between 25 and 35," he said.


Japan has witnessed a growing number of suicide pacts among
groups of strangers who meet on the Internet.


On Monday, police found five bodies in a minivan in Yasu, a rural
town near Lake Biwa some 350 kilometres west of Tokyo.
