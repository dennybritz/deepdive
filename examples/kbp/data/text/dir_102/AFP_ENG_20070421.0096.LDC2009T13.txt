Gunmen massacred a Kurdish Shiite family in Iraq's northern oil
hub of Kirkuk on Saturday, killing an eight-year-old girl, her
elder sister and and parents, police and a medic said.


Police Captain Mohammed Ibrahim said gunmen broke into the house
of Dawood Nuri Mohammed al-Ari and killed him, along with his
wife and two daughters.


"The eight-year-old daughter, Sunoor, was slaughtered," he told
AFP indicating that her neck was cut from her body.


Ibrahim said the killings appeared to be sectarian as "nothing
was stolen" from the family's home.


In the past few months, insurgents have stepped up attacks in and
around Kirkuk, an ethnically volatile city claimed by both Arabs
and Kurds.


Longstanding Kurdish demands for the city to incorporated in
their autonomous region in northern Iraq are to be put to a
referendum before December 30.
