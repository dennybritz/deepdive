A 17-year-old Swedish girl who went missing in Syria under
mysterious circumstances has returned home after six weeks, the
Swedish foreign ministry said on Saturday.


"She returned home the day before yesterday," spokeswoman Aasa
Arvidsson told AFP.


The ministry would not comment on the circumstances of the girl's
disappearance.


According to the Swedish media, the girl was kidnapped during the
early hours of March 9 while she was on holiday with her brother.


Her family, who live in Sweden, were said to have received an
anonymous call saying she was being held by four men and one
woman in Syria, tabloid Expressen reported.


The Svenska Dagbladet daily said on Saturday that the girl
contacted the Swedish embassy in Damascus herself and was given
help to return home.


Swedish police are investigating her disappearance.
