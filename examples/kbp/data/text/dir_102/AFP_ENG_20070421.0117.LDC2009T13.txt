A more than two-month-old security plan for Baghdad is heading in
the "right" direction despite efforts by insurgents to undermine
it, Australian Defence Minister Brendon Nelson said Saturday.


Nelson's unannounced visit to the Iraqi capital comes a day after
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates wound up a two-day trip to
check on the progress of the crackdown.


A number of high-profile car bombings killed more than 200 people
this week in Baghdad despite the presence of some 80,000 Iraqi
and US troops on the capital's mean streets.


"The security plan currently in action is going in the right
direction despite the challenges," Nelson said in his talks with
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki.


A statement from Maliki's office said Nelson pledged Australia's
"full support" for the Iraqi government, particularly in
developing the country's dilapidated infrastructure.


"Our country is intent to play a bigger role in the
reconstruction drive that is currently on in Iraq," the statement
quoted Nelson as saying.


Australia has around 1,400 troops in Iraq, of which 550 are
combat troops and largely deployed in the south alongside British
forces.
