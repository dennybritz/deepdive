A 56-year-old New Zealand woman has died after being savaged by
two dogs as she went for a morning walk Saturday, police said.


It was not known what prompted the attack and the dogs have since
been destroyed.


Virginia Ohlson suffered injuries to her lower limbs when she was
mauled by the dogs in the central North Island town of Murupara.


Nearby residents heard the attack and raced to the woman's aid,
but she died while being rushed to hospital in an ambulance.


Detective Senior Sergeant Mark Loper said the owner of the dogs
-- one believed to be a pit bull and the other a Staffordshire
cross -- was devastated by the attack and was cooperating fully
with police.


"A decision as to what charges the owner of the dogs will face
will not be made until after the investigation has been
completed," he said.


"It is not clear what sparked the attack."


He said the cause of death was not yet known.


"A postmortem examination will be conducted later today. However,
it is unclear when the result of that examination will be known,"
he added.


Ohlson lived in Murupara and regularly walked past the property
where the dogs stayed.
