Japanese police stormed an apartment in suburban Tokyo early
Saturday, ending a 15-hour standoff with an armed man.


Police fired tear gas as they entered the apartment building
shortly after 3:00 a.m. (1800 GMT) to arrest the man after he
shot at police cars.


Yuji Takeshita, a 36-year-old gangster, had apparently shot
himself, and sustained severe head injuries. He is believed to
have gunned down a fellow gangster before holing himself up in
the apartment.


Officers found two guns in Takeshita's home and immediately
arrested him for possessing weapons, the Jiji Press news agency
reported.


Japanese television footage showed an ambulance rushing him to a
nearby hospital.


The rare shootout came just days after Nagasaki's mayor was
gunned down in a killing that has stunned a nation which prides
itself on its safety record.


Gun crimes are rare in Japan, which bans possession of firearms
except for police officers and a limited number of licence
holders.


Before storming into the apartment, police used a telephone call
from another gangster to try to persuade the man to give himself.


Takeshita replied "I want to apologise with my death," Japanese
newspapers reported.


"I'm relieved, it's good that no one living around here was
injured," said one middle-aged local resident after the man's
arrest.


"I don't want this kind of accident to happen again in the
future, " another man said.
