Two soldiers were killed and two others seriously wounded
Saturday in a roadside bomb attack in Thailand's restive Muslim-
majority south, police said.


The 10-kilogram (22-pound) bomb hit an army Humvee carrying four
soldiers in Pattani, one of three insurgency-torn southern
provinces bordering Malaysia, they said.


The bomb was set off by a remote control and the vehicle was
totally destroyed in the blast, said Major Wipat Suwannarat in
Pattani.


The attack came just a day after Thailand's army-backed Prime
Minister Surayud Chulanont, a former general, made a one-day
visit to the troubled region where more than 2,100 people have
been killed in the three-year unrest.


Despite Surayud's peace efforts, including an apology to Muslims
for past abuses, near-daily shootings and bomb attacks continue
to rock the region.


The three Muslim-majority provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and
Pattani were once an autonomous sultanate, until the region was
annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a century ago. Separatist
unrest has erupted periodically ever since.
