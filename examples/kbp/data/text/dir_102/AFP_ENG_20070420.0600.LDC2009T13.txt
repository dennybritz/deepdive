All Blacks hardman Jerry Collins has movement and feeling in all
his limbs, a spokesman for his rugby club said Saturday -- easing
fears of a serious neck injury.


Collins was stretchered off the field during Friday night's Super
14 game between his Wellington Hurricanes and the Canterbury
Crusaders.


The tough loose forward lay prone on the ground for several
minutes after his neck snapped back when his head collided with
the shoulder of Crusaders centre Rua Tupoki.


The Hurricanes medical team later said that Collins had reported
hearing a noise in the neck area during the tackle and complained
of some numbness to his shoulder.


But Hurricanes media spokesman Sam Rossiter-Stead said Saturday
that Collins spent the night in hospital and had movement and
feeling in all his limbs.


He was due to see a specialist later Saturday.
