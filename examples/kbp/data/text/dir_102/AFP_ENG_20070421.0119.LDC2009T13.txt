Four British women who forced two toddlers to fight as they were
filmed savagely punching each other, have walked free from court.


The mother of the children, Zara Olver, 21, admitted child
cruelty and was given a one-year suspended sentence by Plymouth
Crown Court on Friday.


Judge Francis Gilbert also handed the same sentence to the
children's 48-year- old grandmother and two aunts.


The four women were filmed goading the youngsters to hit each
other until they cried. A two-year-old boy was called a "wimp"
for refusing to fight his three- year-old sister.


At one point, one of the women encouraged the boy to hit his
sister with a hairbrush.


Gilbert also ordered the four women from Plymouth, in southern
England, to do 100 hours of community service and banned them
from working with children.


He told the women: "I have seen the video and found it shocking
to watch. All of you laughed at the children and mocked them and
swore at them.


"You encouraged them to hit each other even though they clearly
did not want to do so.


"They were crying, they were hurt and they were upset but
repeatedly you told them to punch and kick each other.


"You were cruel, you were callous and you were quite clearly
causing the children to hurt each other for your own pleasure and
that is one of the most disturbing aspects of this case," he
added.


The shocking seven-minute video was only found by chance by the
toddlers' father, who returned back to Britain after serving with
the armed forces in Iraq. He immediately reported it to social
services.
