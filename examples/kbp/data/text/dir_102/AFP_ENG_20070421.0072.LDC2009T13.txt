India's prime minister, in a thinly veiled attack on the
opposition Hindu nationalist party, said on Saturday that bigoted
forces were trying to destroy the nation's religious harmony.


Forces of bigotry and communalism were trying to tear apart the
"fine fabric of our composite culture" in majority Hindu but
officially secular India," Congress party Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh told an inter-faith meeting.


"What is worse than religious intolerance is the deployment of
such intolerance for narrow political gain," Singh added in the
Indian capital.


The statements came after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) was shaken this month by publicity surrounding the
release of an anti-Muslim CD during crucial elections in India's
most populous state Uttar Pradesh.


The BJP has denied any official role in the production of the CD
aimed at winning Hindu votes in Uttar Pradesh that talked about
"Hindu girls being forced to adopt Islam" and shows a Muslim man
planting a bomb under a car.


Uttar Pradesh has a significant Muslim population.


India's Election Commission is investigating the CD which the
BJP's leaders have said was released as campaign material without
their knowledge.


"Any political formation trying to incite people in the name of
religion, whatever religion, is in fact betraying both religion
and our constitution," the prime minister said, without naming
the BJP.


Muslims make up about 13 percent of India's billion-plus
population.
