UN chief Ban Ki-moon is sending a fact-finding mission to Fiji to
assess the situation in the Pacific island nation and hold broad-
based consultations following last December's military coup, his
press office said Friday.


The mission, which is due to arrive in Fiji Sunday, will try "to
gain a first- hand assessment of the situation through broad
consultations with  interim authorities, representatives of all
political parties and civil society," Ban's spokeswoman Michele
Montas said in a statement.


She said Ban, who is currently on an overseas tour, was
dispatching the team in response to the UN Security Council's
call for the restoration of democracy and a peaceful resolution
of the political turmoil in Fiji.


Friday, Fiji's coup leader appeared to back away from a European
Union statement that his regime had given a firm commitment to
hold elections and restore democracy within two years.


The EU said Voreqe Bainimarama's regime had agreed to hold
elections by March 1, 2009 following talks with the bloc in
Brussels.


The EU had threatened to suspend millions of dollars of aid
unless Fiji's military regime agreed to respect human rights and
restore democracy quickly following December's bloodless coup.


Bainimarama staged the coup after accusing prime minister
Laisenia Qarase's government of corruption and of favoring the
indigenous majority over the ethnic Indian minority.
