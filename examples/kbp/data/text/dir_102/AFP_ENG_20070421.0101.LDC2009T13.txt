Voting in Nigeria's parliamentary elections was suspended
Saturday in most of central Lagos, the economic capital, because
of errors on the ballot papers, electoral officials said.


The key simultaneous presidential poll was still going ahead in
the affected areas, the head of the electoral agency in the city,
Solomon Adedeji Soyebi, said.


He said that names of candidates for two parties and the party
logos were missing from the papers for the Lagos Central and
Lagos West districts, and voting had been deferred to another
date.


Voting across the country for the presidential and legislative
elections had already been delayed two hours on Saturday because
ballot papers were late in arriving from South Africa, where they
had been printed in a bid to minimise fraud.


Some of the areas affected by the postponement are thickly-
populated, including Surulere, Lagos Island, Mushin, Ajegunle,
Amuwo-Odofin, Ojo, Oshodi and Ikeja.


Channels television also reported that voting had been suspended
in several parts of southern Rivers State for similar reasons.


The absence of the pictures of 10 of the 23 Lagos governorship
candidates on ballot papers in elections last Saturday triggered
protests in several parts of the city of nine million
inhabitants.


Saturday's crucial presidential and National Assembly poll should
lead to Nigeria's first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power
since the nation gained independence from Britain in 1960.
