An East Timorese appeal court Saturday confirmed the final
results of the nation's April 9 presidential election.


Appeal court head Claudio Ximenes announced that the results of
the ballot were final, with Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta and
the ruling Fretilin party's Francisco Guterres to contest a
runoff next month.


Results from the polls, first announced on Wednesday, had been
delayed after a technical error was discovered and also because
of concerns of irregularities.


Three losing candidates appealed on Thursday, further delaying
official confirmation of the final results.


Voter turnout in the April 9 poll was high and Timorese are
hoping the election stalemate will not plunge the impoverished
nation into more turmoil and bloodshed.


The runoff for the largely ceremonial post is due to be held on
May 8.
