A dissident member of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development
Party (AKP) put forward his candidacy Saturday for presidential
elections next month, officials said.


Ersonmez Yarbay, 54, is unlikely to receive the support of the
AKP, which is virtually certain to elect the candidate of its
choice thanks to a two-third majority it holds in parlaiment,
where the president is elected.


Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the party will
announce its candidate either on Tuesday or Wednesday. The
registration deadline expires at midnight on Wednesday.


Yarbay is the first candidate to register for the elections to
elect a successor to the outgoing President Ahmet Necdet Sezer,
whose seven-year term ends on May 16.


Yarbay has often criticised the AKP for having failed to ensure
party democracy. His presidential application appears also to be
a protest at Erdogan's decision not to reveal the party's
candidate until the 10-day registration period is nearly over.


The AKP executive board has given Erdogan full authority to
decide the party's candidate.


Erdogan's apparent intention to stand for president has faced
harsh objections by secularists who argue that the prime
minister, a former Islamist who now describes himself as a
conservative democrat, is a divisive figure with no true
commitment to Turkey's secular system.
