Myanmar and North Korea are likely to sign an agreement next week
to resume diplomatic ties, sources said Saturday, more than two
decades after the reclusive states cut off relations over a
deadly bomb attack.


"The two sides are likely to reach an agreement next week to
resume diplomatic relations," a foreign ministry source told AFP.


"But we are still discussing details," the source said, declining
to give further information including the arrival date of the
North Korean delegation.


A Yangon-based Western diplomat told AFP that the North Korean
delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Yong-Il was
visiting China and would travel to Myanmar at the end of April.


"They will definitely come to Myanmar at the end of this month.
But we cannot confirm the exact date yet," said the diplomat who
declined to be named.


Military-run Myanmar and communist North Korea severed ties after
the North staged a deadly bomb attack on a South Korean
government delegation at the Martyr's Mausoleum, near the famous
Shwedagon pagoda, in Yangon in 1983.


The attack aimed to assassinate South Korea's then-president Chun
Doo Hwan who was on an official visit to Yangon.


Chun survived the blast but it killed 17 of his entourage,
including four cabinet ministers, while 17 others were wounded.
Four Myanmar officials also died in the blast.
