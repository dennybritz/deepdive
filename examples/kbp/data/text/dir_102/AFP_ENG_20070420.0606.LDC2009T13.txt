Mark Calcavecchia turned in another bogey-free effort on Friday
to take the halfway lead in the 6.1 million-dollar Zurich Classic


The 1989 British Open champion, who is seeking his second victory
of 2007 and the 14th US Tour title of his career, fired a steady
three-under 69 for a nine- under total of 135.


The American veteran was one shot in front of Lucas Glover and
Nick Watney. Glover also signed for a 69, while Watney recorded a
67 at the TPC Louisiana.


In the 15 times that he has held the lead after two rounds,
Calcavecchia has gone on to win on four occasions.


PGA Tour rookie Kyle Reifers, who fired a course-record 64 on
Thursday, dropped into a tie for fourth with Charley Hoffman, two
shots behind after signing for a 73.


Starting on the back nine, the 23-year-old American bogeyed two
of his first six holes.


Three strokes off the pace were Wes Short (69), Paul Stankowski
(69), Steven Wheatcroft (70), Jason Schultz (71) and Sweden's
Daniel Chopra (68).


Also in the mix at five-under was Bubba Watson, who carded a 67
on Friday to rebound from an opening-round 72.


Defending champion Chris Couch just made the cut at 1-under after
following an even-par 72 in the opening round with a 71.


The tournament has returned to the 7,341-yard TPC Louisiana after
a one-year hiatus, during which the course was under repairs in
the wake of Hurricane Katrina.


Nearly 2,000 trees were lost due to the storm that devastated the
Gulf coast, and a number of holes were completely under water.


It took more than a year to get the course back into shape, and
the tournament was held last year at English Turn Golf and
Country Club.
