A nine-year-old boy was killed and two others, aged nine and 10,
were injured in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey on Saturday when
an object they found in the street exploded, the Anatolia news
agency reported.


It was not immediately clear what object the children discovered
as they played in the street in Sirnak town.


A man who was passing by was also injured, the report said.


Turkey's southeast has been the theatre of a bloody two-decade
conflict between the army and Kurdish rebels fighting for self-
rule that has claimed more than 37,000 lives.


Several other children have been killed or injured in the region
in the past after tampering with hand grenades or small homemade
bombs they have found dumped outdoors, mostly in rural areas.
