New court documents show US police are probing the possibility
that Cho Seung- Hui may have confided to someone else his plans
to unleash a massacre Virginia Tech university, ABC News reported
Friday.


The shooting Monday, deemed the worst of its kind in US history,
left 32 students and teachers dead.


The network said that in a search warrant affidavit filed by
Virginia State Police Friday, authorities say the shooter "may
have communicated with others concerning his plans to carry out
attacks on students and faculty at Virginia Tech."


Police are now seeking Cho's cell phone records from Verizon
Wireless in New Jersey, according to the report.


In another warrant affidavit filed Friday, police seek to mine
Virginia Tech's computer servers, to see if Cho may have
communicated by email with Emily Hilscher, one of two victims
shot in Ambler Johnston Hall, ABC News said.


The affidavit says that "there is probable cause to believe the
computer information maintained by Virginia Tech for Cho Seung-
Hui and victim Emily Hilscher, may contain information relating"
to the shootings, according to the report.


The warrant also cites a criminal investigative analyst who tells
police "that in 80 to 85 percent of homicide cases the victim is
known to the offender," the network said.
