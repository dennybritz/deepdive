Two soldiers were killed and two others seriously wounded
Saturday in a roadside bomb attack in Thailand's restive Muslim-
majority south, police said.


The bomb hit an army Humvee carrying four soldiers in Pattani,
one of three insurgency-torn southern provinces bordering
Malaysia, they said.


The 10-kilogram (22-pound) bomb was set off by a remote control
and the vehicle was totally destroyed in the blast, said Major
Wipat Suwannarat in Pattani.


The attack came just a day after Thailand's army-backed Prime
Minister Surayud Chulanont, a former general, made a one-day
visit to the troubled region where more than 2,100 people have
been killed in three years of unrest.


Despite Surayud's peace efforts, including an apology to Muslims
for past abuses, near-daily shootings and bomb attacks continue
to rock the region.


Major General Chamlong Khunsong, the army chief of staff in the
south, acknowledged that violence had escalated in recent months,
but stressed that the government was getting more cooperation
from local Muslims.


"Militants are stepping up violence because more and more
villagers are supporting and cooperating with the government,"
Chamlong told AFP.


The three Muslim-majority provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and
Pattani were once an autonomous sultanate, until the region was
annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a century ago. Separatist
unrest has erupted periodically ever since.
