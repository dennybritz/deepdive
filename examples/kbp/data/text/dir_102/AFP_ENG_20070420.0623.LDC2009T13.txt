Convalescing Cuban President Fidel Castro Friday met with a high-
ranking Chinese official who brought a card from the China's
president, Hu Jintao, local television reported.


"For an hour, Fidel met with a member of the (Chinese Communist
Party). The meeting was fruitful and touched on a number of
themes," according to a government statement.


The exchange was "an expression of the excellent relations that
have developed between the two countries," especially since a
2004 visit by Hu.


The official, Wu Guanzheng, is a member of the Politburo Standing
Committee of the Communist Party of China.


He arrived in Cuba on Thursday for a four-day official visit that
is part of a tour that includes Colombia and Chile.


After meeting with Fidel, Wu saw acting president Raul Castro,
who has served in his brother's place since July, and discussed
"national and international issues of interest to both countries
and marked the excellent relations between the two parties,
governments and peoples," the report said.


China is Cuba's second-most important trade partner after
Venezuela, with two- way trade close to two billion dollars in
2006, and one of Cuba's principal sources of credit.
