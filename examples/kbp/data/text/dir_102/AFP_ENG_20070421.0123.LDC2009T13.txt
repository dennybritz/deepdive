Jazz pianist and composer Andrew Hill, whose work only recently
found a wide audience, has died at his home in Jersey City, New
Jersey at the age of 75, The New York Times reported Saturday.


Citing the musician's wife, Joanne Robinson Hill, the newspaper
said the cause was lung cancer.


Hill was born in Chicago in 1931. He started playing music at the
age of seven, first learning the accordion and then the piano.


He eventually played be-bop with local musicians in Chicago, and
worked on the road with Dinah Washington, Johnny Hartman and
Dakota Staton, The Times said.


He got a chance to play with Charlie Parker at the Greystone
Ballroom in Detroit in 1954.


A job with Roland Kirk -- later Rahsaan Roland Kirk -- brought
him to New York in the early 1960s, the paper said.
