Two leading contenders in Nigeria's presidential election cast
their ballots on Saturday with the ruling party's candidate
predicting he would win the contest.


Umaru Yar'Adua, the presidential hopeful of the ruling Peoples
Democratic Party (PDP), voted in this northern city expressing
confidence that he would win.


"I am confident that given the strength of my party and my
widespread political rallies across Nigeria, I am going to win
this election," he said shortly after casting his ballot at
Modoji primary school polling centre.


One of his main rivals in the contest,  Muhammadu Buhari,
meanwhile voted in his native Daura, also in Katsina state.


Buhari, 64, a former military head of state, and Vice President
Atiku Abubakar who defected from the PDP, are the main
competitors to Yar'Adua to replace outgoing President Olesegun
Obasanjo.


Yar'Adua, who is widely tipped to win the poll said that if he
failed at the poll, he would cooperate and support the winner.


"I will accept the result most heartily. If the winner invites me
to join his government, I will be happy to give my quota for the
progress of Nigeria," said Yar'Adua, 55.


"This election is very important to our country... it is the
first time we are attempting to transit from one civilian
government to another. I have no doubt that it will succeed,"
said Yar'Adua, who is also the governor of Katsina State.
