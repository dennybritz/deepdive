Seven people were killed and five others were wounded in separate
attacks in Sri Lanka's restive northern and eastern regions, the
defence ministry said Saturday.


Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels set off a landmine targeting troops
on patrol early Saturday in Batticaloa, 300 kilometres (190
miles) east of Colombo, the military said.


A civilian was killed in the attack, which also injured three
others, including a police commando, the military said, adding
that investigations were underway.


In the northern district of Vavuniya, 260 kilometres from
Colombo, troops on foot patrol fired at suspected Tamil Tigers
killing four rebels late Friday.


Security forces did not suffer any casualties in the
confrontation, the ministry said.


A powerful landmine explosion in the northeastern district of
Polonnaruwa late Friday also killed two soldiers and wounded two
others, the defence ministry said.


The victims were travelling in a tractor and trailer when their
vehicle was hit by the blast, the ministry said and blamed the
attack on the Tamil Tigers, saying they could have planted the
landmine some time ago.


There was no immediate reaction about the attacks from the Tamil
Tigers, who have been fighting for an independent homeland for
minority Tamils from the majority Sinhalese island.


The attacks came as the air force stepped up attacks against
suspected Tamil Tiger positions in the north and east.


More than 4,000 people have been killed since December 2005 in a
new wave of fighting despite a truce in place since February
2002. The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
