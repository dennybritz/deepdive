Three people were killed in Indonesia when a landslide buried a
house, police said Saturday.


A mother and her two daughters died in the accident, caused by
heavy rain in West Java province, but the father survived, state
news agency Antara reported.


"The landslide buried a house in Samarang village last night at
about 10 pm, killing three people," a local police spokesman told
AFP.


Another landslide caused a train to derail Saturday in a nearby
village, injuring more than 30 people and causing disruption on
one of the country's busiest routes.


Landslides are a persistent problem in Indonesia. Last month 40
people were killed in landslides and flash floods on Flores
island.
