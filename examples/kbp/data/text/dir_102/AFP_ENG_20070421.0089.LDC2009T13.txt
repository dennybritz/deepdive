The world's fifth space tourist, US-Hungarian Charles Simonyi,
left the International Space Station on Saturday with two ISS
crew members and started the descent towards Earth.


A Soyuz capsule carrying Simonyi together with the outgoing team
-- Russia's Mikhail Tyurin and American Miguel Lopez-Alegria --
cast off from the ISS at 0911 GMT, RIA Novosti reported, quoting
Russian control centre spokesman Valery Lyndin.


The capsule was due to touch down at 1230 GMT Saturday in the
steppes of Kazakhstan.


Simonyi, who made his fortune at Microsoft, is the fifth tourist
to travel to the ISS, following Dennis Tito (2001) and Greg Olsen
(2005) of the United States, South Africa's Mark Shuttleworth
(2002) and an American of Iranian origin, Anousheh Ansari (2006).


The voyage cost him 25 million dollars (19 million euros).


Space Adventures, the company that organised the trips, plans to
expand its offerings next year to include a 100-million-dollar
trip around the moon and a 100,000-dollar budget option: five
minutes of sub-orbital space flight.
