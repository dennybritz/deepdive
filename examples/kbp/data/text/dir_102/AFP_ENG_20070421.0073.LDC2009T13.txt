Polls began opening Saturday amid chaos and tension in Nigeria's
landmark presidential elections, due to see the first post-
colonial transfer of power between two civilian presidents in
Africa's most populous nation.


The first of Nigeria's 61.5 million voters cast their ballots as
booths opened at 0900 GMT in the commercial capital Lagos, in
northern Kaduna and in Abeokuta (south-west), where outgoing
President Olusegun Obasanjo is to cast his vote.


Voting began after police reported a foiled bomb attack on the
offices of the Electoral Commission (INEC) in the capital Abuja
and a shoot-out in the southern oil-rich Delta, where one of the
leading vice-presidential candidates was present.


It was also unclear whether 65 million ballot papers, ready for
distribution only on the eve of the voting on Friday, had arrived
in the country's 120,000 polling stations.
