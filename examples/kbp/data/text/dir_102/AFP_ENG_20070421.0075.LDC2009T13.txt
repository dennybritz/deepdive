An Egyptian with Canadian citizenship was sentenced to 15 years
behind bars on Saturday on charges of spying for Israel, judicial
sources said.


Judge Sayyed al-Gohary of Cairo's high state security court
sentenced Mohammed Essam Ghoneim al-Attar, 31, and three Israelis
tried in absentia, to 15 years in prison and a fine of 10,000
Egyptian pounds (1,760 dollars) each.


Attar, who was in court for the sentencing, flashed a victory
sign upon hearing the verdict before being led away.


Throughout his trial which began in February, he maintained his
innocence and claimed Egyptian security services extracted a
confession from him by torture.


Attar was arrested while visiting his family in Cairo on January
1, on charges of bribery, espionage and conspiring to "harm
Egypt's national interests."


A former student at Cairo's Al-Azhar University, Attar is accused
of spying for Israel's Mossad and has been described in the press
as a homosexual and a convert to Christianity.


According to the charges against him, Attar contacted the
Israelis in Turkey where he started spying for them on other
expatriate Arabs, a practice he continued after emigrating to
Canada.


Attar has no right of appeal.
