Voting started in France's presidential elections Saturday, as
polling booths opened in the tiny overseas territory of Saint
Pierre and Miquelon a day ahead of the French mainland.


Only some 5,000 people are registered to vote in the archipelago,
which lies off Canada's Atlantic coast.


Altogether around one million French voters -- citizens of
overseas territories and expatriates in the Americas -- were to
vote Saturday.


Rules were changed recently so that inhabitants of the Americas
-- which lie several hours behind France -- would not hear of
early results from the mainland when they cast their votes in
elections.


Some 44.5 million voters are choosing a successor to President
Jacques Chirac, in a two round vote that concludes on May 6.


Of 12 candidates in Sunday's first round only two qualify for the
decider, with right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Segolene
Royal the frontrunners.
