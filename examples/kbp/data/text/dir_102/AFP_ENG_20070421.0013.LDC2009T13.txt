A Vietnamese court has jailed five members of a network that
enabled students to cheat in exams by feeding them information
via mobile telephone headsets hidden under wigs, state media said
Saturday.


Nguyen Hong Hai, 40, who charged students more than 3,000 dollars
each in the scam during last summer's high-pressure university
entrance exams, was sentenced to two years and nine months in
jail, said the Nhan Dan daily.


The Hanoi People's Court on Friday also sentenced one other
defendant to 20 months in jail, and three more to 18 months'
prison each, while another three accomplices received suspended
sentences of 15 months each.


Police last July said they had confiscated five wigs, 50 mobile
telephones, 60 ear pieces and 150 mobile SIM cards that were
being used in the scam to help students pass the highly
competitive annual examinations.
