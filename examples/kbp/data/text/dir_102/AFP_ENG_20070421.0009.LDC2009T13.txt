A pleasure boat on a Tokyo river capsized Saturday, officials
said, prompting fears that the passengers may have been swept
away.


"We found a capsized boat in the Arakawa River but couldn't find
anyone who was on board," said an official at the Tokyo
metropolitan government's fire department.


"We are searching for people who apparently have been swept away,
although we don't know how many were on board," he said.
