The Non-Aligned Movement, which is currently led by Cuba, Friday
stated its "great concern" over the release of convicted anti-
Castro activist and former CIA operative, Luis Posada Carriles.


"The Non-Aligned Movement has received with great concern the
news issued by international new agencies on the release on bail
of the notorious international terrorist Luis Posada Carriles by
decision of a United States court," the alliance of developing
countries said in a statement.


The group called for the United States to fulfill international
obligations by "extradicting the perpetrators of terrorist acts."


Posada Carriles is wanted in both Cuba and Venezuela in
connection with a 1976 plane bombing that killed 73 people.


He was detained by US immigration officials in May 2005 for
entering the United States illegally. But US authorities have
refused to extradite him to Cuba or Venezuela, expressing fears
he might be tortured.


The movement reiterated its support for Venezuela's claim to
Posada Carriles, calling on the United States to bring him "to
justice."
