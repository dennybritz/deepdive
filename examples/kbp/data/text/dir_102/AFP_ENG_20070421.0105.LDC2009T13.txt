Rome on Saturday celebrated the 2,760-year-old legend of its
founding, with a host of festivities planned including fireworks
and live music across the city.


Legend holds that Romulus founded the Eternal City in 753 BC
before killing his rebellious twin brother Remus, both raised by
a she-wolf.


Museums are opening their doors to visitors for free, and a
special stamp has been issued for the occasion.


Kicking off celebrations late Friday was the premiere of veteran
director Franco Zeffirelli's staging of Verdi's "La Traviata" at
the Rome Opera which was shown live in 22 cinemas across Italy.


Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu went down well with the
audience in the role of Violetta, while Italian baritone Renato
Bruson was encored for his performance of "Di Provenza", the Il
Messagero daily reported.


The production is the eighth in 84-year-old Zeffirelli's career,
including one with Maria Callas, and will run until May 3.


Italian actor and director Roberto Benigni also staged the Rome
premiere of his one-man show late Friday mixing poetry and
politics, and winning a standing ovation from an audience of
4,000, according to the press.
