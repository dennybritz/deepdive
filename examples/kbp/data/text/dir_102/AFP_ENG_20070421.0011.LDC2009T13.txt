Two soldiers were killed and two wounded in a powerful landmine
explosion in northeastern Sri Lanka, the defence ministry said
Saturday.


The victims were travelling in a tractor and trailer in the
district of Polonnaruwa when their vehicle was hit by the blast
on Friday evening, the ministry said.


The ministry blamed the Tamil Tigers, saying they could have
planted the landmine some time ago.


The attack came as the air force stepped up attacks against
suspected Tamil Tiger positions in the embattled northern and
eastern regions.


More than 4,000 people have been killed since December 2005 in a
new wave of fighting despite a truce in place since February
2002. The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
