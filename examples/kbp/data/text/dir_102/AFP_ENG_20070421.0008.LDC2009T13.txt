US Defense Secretary Robert Gates has returned from a trip to the
Middle East, during which he focused on the escalating violence
in Iraq.


A plane carrying Gates and his aides touched down at Andrews Air
Force Base outside the US capital shortly before midnight Friday
(0400 GMT Saturday).


Gates, who was in Baghdad earlier Friday, had urged Iraqi leaders
to end sectarian conflict and warned that American troops would
not stay on indefinitely if no progress is made.
