The family of the US campus shooter said Friday they were "deeply
sorry" for the massacre and that they never could have imagined
that the South Korean student "was capable of so much violence."


In a statement, Cho Seung-Hui's sister, Cho Sun-Kyung, said the
family felt "hopeless, helpless and lost," in their first comment
since her 23-year-old brother killed 32 people and himself at
Virginia Tech University Monday.


"On behalf of our family, we are so deeply sorry for the
devastation my brother has caused," said Cho Sun-Kyung, who works
as a contractor at the US State Department.
