More than 30 people were injured when heavy rain caused a train
to derail on one of Indonesia's busiest routes Saturday,
officials said.


The train was travelling from Jakarta to Garut in West Java when
it derailed, a spokesman for the state-owned train company
spokesman told the Detikcom news portal


"This was purely an accident. Heavy rains caused the land below
the tracks to slide and lead to the derailment of the train," he
said.


"Twenty six people were slightly injured and five were more
seriously hurt."


One victim underwent emergency treatment for his wounds, but was
now stable, and the others were released after receiving
treatment for more minor injuries, a nurse at the local hospital
said.


Accidents are relatively common on Indonesian railways. There
have also been a spate of airliner and ferry disasters in recent
months, which in total have claimed hundreds of lives.


The accidents have triggered criticism of Indonesia's transport
safety record, and the government has said it is working to
protect passengers.
