Police evacuated a building at NASA's Johnson Space Center Friday
after receiving a report that a gunshot was fired inside the
building.


A Houston police spokesman reached by AFP could not confirm if
there were any injured people inside the building.


"There was a report of a shot fired at building 44 ... inside the
building," said Victor Santinas. "I can't confirm anything beyond
that."


CNN broadcast images of a large group of people gathered outside
the buidling under police protection.


The network reported that an employee armed with a handgun was
inside the building. It was not clear whether or not there were
any hostages in the building.


"Our security rules certainly do not allow weapons on the
property, NASA spokesman James Hartsfield told CNN.


"But, you know, I wouldn't speculate on what occurred here or
how, you know, the incident developed because I just don't have
those details at this point."


Building 44 is one of the smaller buildings on the sprawling
campus. It is an engineering facility for the communication and
tracking of space shuttle work, the Houston Chronicle reported.


Johnson Space Center is home to the mission control center for
space shuttle missions.
