A police post on the French island of Corsica was targeted in a
shooting incident overnight but no one was injured, police told
AFP on Saturday as France prepared to vote in presidential
elections.


The unidentified assailant fired at least 10 shots with an
automatic gun in the village of Cauro near the main city of
Ajaccio, hitting the building and a police car.


The post had already been targeted in May 2004 in a rocket attack
which was claimed by separatists.


The latest attack came hours before a major rally in Ajaccio
called by separatist movements and condemning "French colonial
rule". Organisers also want imprisoned Corsican nationalists to
be freed.


"We are telling the French state and the candidates in the
presidential election that Corsica has a political problem which
needs a political solution," one of the spokesmen for the rally
told AFP.


In a separate attack overnight the holiday home of a Corsican
teacher was damaged by a bomb blast.


Earlier Friday, an explosion destroyed a bank branch in the
southern French city of Marseille without injuring anyone.


Investigators told AFP the attack bore the hallmark of Corsican
separatists.


Corsica has been plagued by more than 30 years of low-level
violence waged by separatists opposed to French rule.
