Japanese police stormed into an apartment in suburban Tokyo early
Saturday, ending a standoff with an armed man 15 hours after he
holed himself up after opening fire on them.


The armed police officers of Tokyo's special investigation team
fired tear-gas and stormed into the four-storey apartment complex
in Machida city shortly after 3 am (1800 GMT).


Police found 36-year-old gangster Yuji Takeshita inside with
severe injuries to the head apparently after he shot himself,
Jiji press news agency reported.


Japanese TV footage showed an ambulance rushing the man to a
nearby hospital. The gangster had not taken any hostages.


In a rare shootout in Japan, which came just days after a
political assassination, Takeshita opened fire at police cars
from his apartment.


He is believed to have gunned down a fellow gangster before he
locked himself in the apartment.


The incident came with the nation still in shock over another
gangster's assassination of the mayor of the southern city of
Nagasaki on Tuesday.


Gun crimes are rare in Japan, which bans possession of firearms
except for police officers and a limited number of licence
holders.
