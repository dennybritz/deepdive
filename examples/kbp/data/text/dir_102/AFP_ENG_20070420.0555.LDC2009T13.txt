Taliban holding two French aid workers hostage in southern
Afghanistan have called for the withdrawal of French NATO troops
and the freeing of imprisoned militants in exchange for their
release, according to a Taliban website Friday.


The website demanded the "French government withdraw its soldiers
from Afghanistan in one week" and called on the Kabul
administration "for a rapid response with regard to an exchange
of prisoners".


Around 1,000 French troops are deployed in the Kabul region as
part of the NATO force.


Paris said Friday night it was analysing the demands.


"We have taken note of the instructions which figure in the
Taliban website. We are analyzing them," said French foreign
ministry spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei.


"We will not make any other comments."


A French envoy is in Kabul as part of diplomatic efforts by Paris
to free the two aid workers from the Terre d'Enfance (A World For
Our Children) charity who were seized in the southwestern
province of Nimroz on April 3.


Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said that his government will
not make any more hostage deals with the Taliban following the
controversial release of five rebels in exchange for kidnapped
Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo last month.


The deal generated outrage as the Italian journalist's Afghan
driver and interpreter were beheaded. The gruesome killings were
filmed following which a shaken Mastrogiacomo was seen urging
Rome to "do something."


The Islamist militia was ousted from power in a US-led invasion
in 2001.
