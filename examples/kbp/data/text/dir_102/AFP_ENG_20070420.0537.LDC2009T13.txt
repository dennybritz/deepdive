Two Turkish engineers kidnapped on April 6 in Nigeria's oil-rich
but volatile south were released by their captors on Friday, the
national Anatolia news agency said.


Turkey was informed by Nigerian officials of the mens' release
and they had been taken to the Turkish embassy in Abuja, it said,
adding that they were in good health.


Ilker Izci and Murat Orhan, who were working for Turkish
telecommunications engineering company Merpa -- a subcontractor
of Italian oil company Agip -- were abducted by armed men who
intercepted their vehicle while they were driving in Port
Harcourt.


Since the beginning of the year, 60 foreigners -- as many as
those kidnapped in the whole of 2006 -- have been abducted in
southern Nigeria.


Most of the hostages have been released unharmed but a few have
been held for protracted periods.


Some of the hostage-takers are well-organised, well-equipped
groups fighting for a greater share of oil wealth to go to local
communities. Others are described by authorities as criminal
gangs out to make money from ransom payments.
