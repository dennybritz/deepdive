One US soldier was killed and two were wounded on Saturday when a
roadside bomb exploded next to their foot patrol 25 kilometres
(15 miles) southwest of Baghdad, the military said.


The death took the US military's losses in Iraq to 55 for this
month alone and to 3,315 since the March 2003 invasion, according
to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
