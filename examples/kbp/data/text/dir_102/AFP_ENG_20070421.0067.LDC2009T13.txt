A Polish soldier has been killed in Iraq and four others slightly
injured in a bomb blast during a patrol in the central city of Al
Diwaniyah, the Polish defence ministry said Saturday.


The explosion happened late on Friday in an area of the city,
southeast of Baghdad, the Polish PAP news agency quoted the
ministry as saying.


The four injured soldiers were taken to the Polish base in the
city. Their injuries are not life-threatening.


The latest death brings the number of Polish soldiers and
journalists to have died in Iraq to 25 since the start of the
conflict in 2003.


Poland, which has backed the United States since the start of the
Iraq crisis, has 900 soldiers there.
