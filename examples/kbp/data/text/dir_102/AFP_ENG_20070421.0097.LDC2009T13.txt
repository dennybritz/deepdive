Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed will attempt
to board a Dhaka-bound plane despite a ban on her entering the
country and a potential murder charge, an aide said Saturday.


The leader of the Awami League, one of the country's two main
parties, will arrive at Heathrow airport to catch a Sunday
British Airways flight, her private secretary Abdus Sobhan Golap
told AFP by telephone from London.


It was not known if BA staff would allow her to board the plane.
The new military-backed interim government on Wednesday told all
airlines operating flights to Bangladesh to take the necessary
measures to prevent Sheikh Hasina from returning.


"She is aware of the bar on her return. It's a confirmed flight.
There is no question of staying back," Golap added.


Sheikh Hasina has been charged with murder and extortion in her
absence and could face arrest if she returns.


The interim government is trying to exile both Sheikh Hasina and
her rival Khaleda Zia, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), who was prime minister until last October.


Zia is expected to leave Bangladesh for exile in Saudia Arabia
over the next few days.


The government has pledged to clean up Bangladesh's political
system which is notoriously corrupt and dysfunctional before
holding elections before the end of 2008.


A political crisis in January has been blamed on the two leaders'
misrule. It saw elections cancelled, emergency rule imposed and
the new interim government installed.


The government has won huge popularity for its anti-graft drive.


Many say they fear the country will lapse back into endless
bloody street confrontations between the two parties if the two
women are not forced out.
