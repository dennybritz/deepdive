Tony Kanaan posted his first win in nine months on Saturday when
he defeated two-time Japan champion Dan Wheldon to win the Indy
Japan 300, the third leg of the 17-round series.


The Brazilian driver covered 200 laps on the 1.5-mile Twin Ring
Motegi course in one hour, 52 minutes and 23.2574 seconds to beat
the Briton into second by 0.4828 seconds.


Dario Franchitti of Britain came in third in 1:52:34.8112, while
defending champion and pole sitter Helio Castroneves of Brazil
was seventh in 1:52:28.3991, one lap behind Kanaan.


"It was a race that I had to be very patient. I think when we
started the car wasn't that good and I knew the track was going
to get better towards the end of the race," said Kanaan.


"So I just waited. A couple of opportunities I had to pass Dan,
and I knew that I had to stop later than him because my car had
better fuel mileage.


"When he made the last stop, I was almost convinced that I could
pit and come out still in front of him. So that's what we did.
The team did a great job," he added.


Wheldon, the winner here in 2004 and 2005, snatched the lead from
Castroneves on the 44th lap before starting to leapfrog for the
lead with Kanaan on the 84th lap.


American Sam Hornish and Scott Dixon of New Zealand broke into
the competition between the two in the last 10 laps, but Kanaan
regained the lead on the 196th to cross the finishing line.


It was Kanaan's first victory after winning at the Milwaukee Mile
in July last year and his eighth overall out of 67 starts.


The fourth round will move to Kansan Speedway on April 29.
