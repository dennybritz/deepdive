Far-right presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen moved into
third place in a new poll published Friday, while Nicolas Sarkozy
maintained a narrow lead two days ahead of France's first round
vote.


The poll by CSA-CISCO shows right-wing candidate Sarkozy with
26.5 percent and Socialist Segolene Royal in second with 25.5
percent. The two frontrunners each lost half a point compared to
the last poll.


Le Pen clocked in at 16.5 percent to overtake centrist candidate
Francois Bayrou in first round intentions to vote. Bayrou lost
one point to fall to 16 percent.


In the second round, the poll shows Royal and Sarkozy at 50
percent each.


Le Pen shocked the country when he made it to the second round in
the 2002 presidential elections, but was soundly defeated by
current President Jacques Chirac in the runoff.


The poll was done Friday with a representative sample of 1,002
registered voters.
