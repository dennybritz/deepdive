Masked gunmen stormed a private American school in the northern
Gaza Strip early Saturday and detonated a series of bombs inside
causing serious damage, witnesses and security sources said.


The gunmen overpowered and then bound three security guards but
there were no casualties in the assault on the school in Beit
Lahiya, an interior ministry official told AFP.


The gunmen took the guards with them when they made their getaway
but released them an hour later.


"We are going to carry out a thorough investigation to find those
reponsible," added the official, who asked not to be identified.


The official said police were considering a possible link with a
wave of attacks on internet cafes in the Gaza Strip over the past
month that has seen around 30 targeted.


Most of the attacks have been claimed by an extremist group
called "The Swords of Truth" that says the cafes offer young
Palestinians access to pornographic websites.


A library run by a Protestant Christian group was also
extensively damaged in a pre-dawn bomb attack in Gaza City last
Sunday.
