Hundreds of bottles of fine Bordeaux wine given to a former
parish priest by parishioners were put up for auction on Saturday
in a move that raised eyebrows in the region.


Auctioneers said the sale of the cellar accounted for some 80
percent of the 700 lots being sold, and included some of the best
labels, such as Cheval-Blanc, Angelus and Figeac.


The current priest in the wine town of Saint Emilion, Emeric de
Rozieres, whose predecessor, named as Father Bonnet, retired in
2006, told AFP that some parishioners had been astonished by the
sale.


He said that Bonnet had received wine from his flock, as many
priests did, but had also given a lot away.


Wine expert Didier Guerin also praised Bonnet, saying that if he
was selling off his wine, it was in order to live, not to take a
holiday or buy a new car.
