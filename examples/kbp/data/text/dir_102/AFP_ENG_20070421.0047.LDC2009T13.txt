Kyrgyz opposition leader Felix Kulov was questioned by state
security officials here Saturday amid a crack-down on the
opposition in this Central Asian country.


On Thursday anti-government demonstrations descended into
violence. The authorities arrested around 100 demonstrators and
dozens were injured in the disturbances when thousands threw
rocks and bottles at the presidential palace and police responded
with tear gas and flares.


Prime Minister Almaz Atambayev has blamed Kulov's "radical
statements" for the violence, which effectively ended 10 days of
anti-government protests, while some in the opposition have
pointed the finger at drunken "provocateurs."


Kulov, a former prime minister, arrived for questioning at the
headquarters of the GKNB internal security agency early Saturday
while around 100 supporters gathered nearby.


On Friday all copies of several opposition newspapers were seized
from a media centre run by US non-governmental organization
Freedom House in a move condemned Saturday by the US State
Department.


The offices of two opposition parties have also been searched.


Strategically located on China's western edge and host to US and
Russian airbases, Kyrgyzstan has experienced regular
demonstrations and unrest since the 2005 ouster of president
Askar Akayev in an uprising.
