The German government said on Saturday that a move to step up
security at US facilities in Germany was Islamist-linked but
refused to speculate on reported possible attacks.


An Interior Ministry spokesman said an "Islamist dimension" had
been behind the decision announced on Friday, adding he would not
"speculate" on various press reports.


According to Saturday's Der Tagesspiegel, an extremist Iraqi
group, Ansar al Sunna, was planning attacks on US citizens and
facilities in Germany.


Der Spiegel magazine reported that German authorities had been
warned by the CIA that an Islamist Kurdish group was thought to
be planning an attack in Germany or a neighbouring country.


The US embassy in Germany said Friday it was increasing security
at US facilities in the country in response to "a heightened
threat situation", although Washington played down the danger.


The State Department in Washington stressed that the embassy
alert was not sparked by any "specific or credible" information
about threats directed against US interests in Germany.


Spokesman Tom Casey said the alert was based on "generic,
unspecific information."
