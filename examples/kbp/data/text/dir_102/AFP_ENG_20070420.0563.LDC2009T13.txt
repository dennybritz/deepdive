An explosion destroyed a bank branch in the southern French city
of Marseille on Friday, but resulted in no injuries, a police
source said.


The police source said the entire Caisse d'Epargne building had
been destroyed by the blast, which occurred shortly after 8:00 pm
French time (1800 GMT).


"It was a big amount of explosives because it destroyed
everything," the source said.


Authorities set up a secure perimeter around the building as
police explosives experts arrived on the scene.
