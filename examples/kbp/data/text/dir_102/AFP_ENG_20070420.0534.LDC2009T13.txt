The European Commission on Friday informed the French and Spanish
authorities that a small number of their vessels can begin
"experimental" anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay next week,
under strict conditions.


The deal allows the industry to dip its toes back in the water
after EU fishing ministers last December decided to stop wide-
scale anchovy fishing in the face of dwindling stocks in the bay
which lies between western France and northern Spain, .


Under the deal, announced by the Commision after a technical
meeting in Brussels on Thursday, up to five French vessels will
be allowed to fish in one sector of the bay and up to 13 Spanish
boats in another sector from Monday.


The rules set out for the exercise include a ban on fishing too
near the coast, a limitation of three tons of fish per vessel per
day and the requirement that a scientific observer be aboard each
boat.


The experiment is aimed at evaluating the numbers and
distribution of anchovies in the bay and will be re-evaluated on
May 23.


The announcement follows a failure by France and Spain to agree
on a deal which would allow 10 percent of the total anchovy
fishing fleet of some 280 vessels to return to work in the bay.


The 18 authorised vessels which will resume operations on Monday
will join the so-called "consort fishery" scheme whereby three
French and seven Spanish boats are already allowed to accompany
research vessels in the area.
