Werder Bremen leapfrogged above Schalke 04 to top the German
first division with a comfortable enough 3-1 win over lowly
Alemannia Aachen on Friday.


Schalke though have the chance to move back in front on Saturday
when they take on Cottbus at home.


Werder got an early shock after just two minutes when Aachen
launched a swift counter-attack that resulted in Sergio Pinto
netting.


After that it was all one-way traffic from the home side but some
poor finishing from Miroslav Klose, Tortsen Frings and Diego let
them down.


The inevitable equaliser came through Daniel Jensen on a pass
from Frings after 50 minutes and five minutes later Werder went
ahead through Markus Rosenberg.


Diego added a third in extra-time with an extraordinary effort
from 50 metres out after the visiting goalkeeper had charged off
his line to take part in a corner kick at the other end of the
field.


Saturday's schedule also includes a battle royale between
reigning champions Bayern Munich and Stuttgart, both of whom are
still in the running for the Bundesliga title.
