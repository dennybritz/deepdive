Thailand's tennis hero Paradorn Srichaphan is engaged to a former
Miss Universe and the couple are expected to tie the knot in
Bangkok later this year, reports said Saturday.


Paradorn, 28, and Natalie Glebova, a 25-year-old Canadian beauty,
have "developed a special relationship" and they will announce
their engagement at a news conference in Bangkok on Tuesday, the
English-daily Nation said.


The couple will tie the knot by the end of this year in "one of
the most celebrated weddings of 2007," the paper said, while the
Thai-language Daily News said the wedding would likely take place
in November.


Paradorn, the former world number nine, and Glebova were first
seen together last year when she kissed him as a reward for
beating Britain's Tim Henman in the quarter-finals of the
Thailand Open, the Nation said.


Glebova, who won the 2005 Miss Universe title in the pageant held
in Thailand, is also popular here. She has visited a temple-
turned-hospice for AIDS patients and has worked as a "brand
ambassador" for the kingdom's Singha beer.


Paradorn was long Asia's top-rated men's player before sliding
out of the world's top 50 for the first time in five years in
2006. He has also become a staple of gossip magazines as he used
to date Thailand's pop diva Tata Young.
