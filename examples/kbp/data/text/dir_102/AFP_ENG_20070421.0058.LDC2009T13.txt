A man who poisoned his eight children, killing five of them, was
on Saturday ruled "not responsible for his actions" by a Kuwaiti
court and ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment.


Four daughters and a son died instantly after the 38-year-old
Muayad al-Saeedi forced them to drink a poison-laced liquid,
while his three other children were later treated successfully in
hospital.


The incident took place two years ago in Jahra, a tribal area 50
kilometres (30 miles) northwest of Kuwait City, after Saeedi's
wife reportedly left the family home.


The ruling by Kuwait's lower court, which can be appealed, was
based on a medical report.
