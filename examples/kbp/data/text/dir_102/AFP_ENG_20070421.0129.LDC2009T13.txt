An engineering student was seriously injured Saturday in a
shooting on a university campus in southern India, police said.


The incident comes less than a week after a deranged student
killed 32 people at the Virginia Tech university in the United
States, although Indian police said the motive in the Hyderabad
shooting appeared to be group rivalry rather than a copycat
action.


A police spokesman identified the injured victim as Mukarram, a
second year student of the Deccan College of Engineering in
Hyderabad, capital of the southern Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh.


He had come to the campus to collect an identity card for exams
when  Obaidullah Khan, a final year student, "suddenly pulled out
a pistol and fired six rounds in all ... two in the air and four
at his rival," said a college official, who wished to remain
unnamed.


Mukarram "received bullet injuries on the lower part of his body,
two injuries to the abdomen and two on the legs," and was
profusely bleeding, added the college official.


The victim was then taken to hospital where doctors described his
condition as serious.


"These two groups are allegedly engaged in trying to establish
their dominance over the juniors," a police spokesman said,
adding the victim had previously been arrested for beating up
members his assailant's gang.


The attacker was arrested after the shooting, police added.
