Raphael Jacquelin held on to his spot atop the leaderboard of the
BMW Asian Open after an exciting third round here Saturday that
saw the field close in on the ice-cool Frenchman.


Jacquelin, who has led the tournament from the start, saw his
three-shot overnight lead quickly eroded as a host of players
took advantage of the calm weather, with Scot Simon Yates
shooting a course record-equalling eight-under 64.


However Jacquelin managed three birdies alongside two bogeys on
the back nine to finish with a two-under 70 and go into the final
round at 11-under, one stroke ahead of Australian Scott Hend, who
shot a 67.


Yates' performance gave him a share of third spot at nine-under,
alongside Sweden's Joakim Backstrom and Soren Kjeldsen of
Denmark, who both carded 68s.


Eight-time European Order of Merit champion Colin Montgomerie of
Scotland was a stroke further back after shooting a 69, alongside
Australia's Markus Brier and Denmark's Soren Hansen.


World number five Ernie Els, the highest ranked player at the
2.3-million dollar tournament, is five shots adrift of Jacquelin.


But, thanks to consecutive birdies on the 15th, 16th and 17th
holes, he said he now had a chance to win the Asian Open for a
second time.
