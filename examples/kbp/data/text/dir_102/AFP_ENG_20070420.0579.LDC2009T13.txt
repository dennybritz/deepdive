A Nigerian navy helicopter crashed Friday in the country's south,
killing its three crew members, a navy spokesman said.


"One of our helicopters crashed .. it killed the pilot, the co-
pilot and the technician on board", Captain Obiora Medani said,
adding that only the three crew members were on board.


He said the accident took place Friday evening close to the
airport of the southern town of Owerri as the aircraft, an
Agusta, was undertaking a routine flight.


"We suspect bad weather and no light" to be the causes of the
accident, he said.


Military planes, as well as civilian aircraft are often involved
in crashes in Nigeria where several hundred people have lost
their lives in such accidents in the past few years.


In September of last year 13 senior military officers died when
their plane crashed into hills.


The crash was the worst involving the military since 1992 when an
airforce plane plunged into creeks at Ejigbo a few minutes after
take-off from Lagos airport, killing all 192 officers and crew on
board.
