American Discovery Channel rider Levi Leipheimer won the fifth
stage of the Tour of Georgia on Friday, the demanding 172km run
from Dalton to Brasstown Bald.


It was Leipheimer's second straight stage win in a row, but his
teammate Janez Brajkovic of Slovenia retained the overall
leader's jersey.


Leipheimer, who won Thursday's 30.4km individual time trial,
finished alone atop Georgia's highest mountain peak, with
teammate and compatriot Tom Danielson second.


Behind them, Brajkovic was battling to hold onto his overall lead
ahead of team CSC's Christian Vandevelde, who went into the stage
12 seconds behind overall.


The pair were often side-by-side on Friday, with Brajkovic
thwarting several attempts by Vandevelde to escape.


Brajkovic finished the same with the same 12-second lead in the
general classification.


Saturday's penultimate stage six takes the riders from Lake
Lanier Islands to Stone Mountain, Georgia, and the event
concludes Sunday with a circuit race that starts and finishes in
Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park.
