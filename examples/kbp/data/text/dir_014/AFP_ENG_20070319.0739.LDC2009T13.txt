The Bank of Japan said Tuesday that it will leave its benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent this month, a decision
that had been widely expected after its February rate hike.


The monetary policy board's decision was reached by a unanimous
vote, the central bank said in a short statement.


The Bank of Japan last month raised its key lending rate from
0.25 percent to 0.50 percent, its first hike since last July when
it ended over five years of virtually free credit.


The BoJ has faced political pressure not to raise interest rates
too quickly and with inflation still very subdued, the central
bank is expected to move cautiously with further monetary
tightening.
