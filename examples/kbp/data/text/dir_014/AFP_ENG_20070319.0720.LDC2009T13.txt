South Korean police said Tuesday they are hunting the Internet
users who posted pornographic clips that became the most viewed
videos on Yahoo Korea.


The portal publicly apologised over the clips, posted for more
than six hours from late Sunday on its multimedia service
"Yammi."


"Our staff failed to notice the obscene video clips for hours
until the clips became the two most viewed videos on the site," a
spokeswoman for Yahoo Korea told AFP.


The cyber crime team at Seoul police said they had secured the
culprits' IP address and were tracking them down.


"Under the law on information and communication, this kind of
crime can be punished with up to one year's imprisonment or a 10
million won (10,600 dollars) fine," an investigator said.


Yahoo Korea temporarily shut down Yammi's upload function and
started checking the monitoring system.


"Yahoo Korea holds itself responsible for the uploading of
illicit video footage on March 18. We are now fully cooperating
with investigative authorities and we publicly apologise over the
incident," it said in a statement.


Yahoo said an average of five staff were assigned to round-the-
clock monitoring of Yammi to screen out inappropriate footage.


"But there are limitations to what they can do as there are about
300 UCC (user created content) videos posted on the site every
day," the spokeswoman said.


Experts say that, unlike text, filtering of video footage is
technically difficult.
