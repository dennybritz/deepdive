EU regulators approved on Tuesday French defence supplier Thales'
plans to take a 25-percent stake in French state-owned military
shipyard DCN.


The European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, said it
"concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede
effective competition" in Europe.


Under the terms of the agreement, Thales is to transfer its naval
shipyard activities to DCN in return for the stake, which was
previously held by the state.


DCN manufactures warships and submarines and supplies defence
computer systems and advanced technology. It counts the French
navy as its main customer but also supplies more than 40 navies
across the world.


Thales, formerly known as Thomson-CSF, is a supplier of
electronics to the defence and security sectors. It is quoted on
the French stock exchange and is 31.3-percent owned by the French
state.
