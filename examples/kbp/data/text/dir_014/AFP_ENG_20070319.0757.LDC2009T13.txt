A US court of appeals ruled Monday that Enron shareholders cannot
pursue a group lawsuit against banks accused of having a role in
the energy giant's collapse in 2001.


The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans,
Louisiana, said a class action lawsuit was not the appropriate
vehicle to sue the banks, which include Merrill Lynch, Barclays
and Credit Suisse First Boston.


"As we have recognized, class certification may be the
backbreaking decision that places 'insurmountable pressure' on a
defendant to settle, even where the defendant has a good chance
of succeeding on the merits," the court ruled.


The ruling will force investors to file individual lawsuits,
which would increase their costs and ease pressure on the firms
to settle, the Financial Times reported on its website.


Enron's spectacular collapse in 2001, then the largest corporate
bankruptcy in history with more than 40 billion dollars in
outstanding debt, rattled energy and stock markets. Thousands
lost their jobs and savings.
