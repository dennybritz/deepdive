US-led coalition and Afghan troops killed three "suspected
extremists" Tuesday in a hunt for a militant said to have ordered
assassinations and suicide bombings, the military said.


The Afghan and coalition forces came under fire during an
operation in Helmand province to find a "known Taliban leader and
facilitator of suicide bombers believed to have controlled as
many as 200 fighters in the area." They returned fire, killing
the three, the coalition said in a statement.


It was not clear whether the targeted commander was among the
dead, a spokeswoman told AFP.


In other Taliban-linked violence in southern Afghanistan, a bomb
hidden in a handcart hit a bus transporting trainee policemen in
the southern city of Kandahar Tuesday, wounding three students,
police said.


The coalition, which helped to topple the Taliban from government
in late 2001, said the commander was responsible for "ordering
assassinations of Afghan government officials."


He was also "believed to have helped move suicide attackers into
Helmand province by way of Kandahar and other nearby cities."


There have been several recent attacks on Afghan and coalition
forces in the area, which is around the town of Gereshk.
