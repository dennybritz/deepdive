Israel was set to to stage its biggest ever nationwide war drill
on Tuesday to test the response of rescue services in case of an
unconventional weapon attack.


The exercise, being staged jointly by police and the army home
front command, will take place over two days in 132 towns and has
been described by the authorities as the biggest since the
creation of the Jewish state in 1948.


"The aim of the exercise is to prepare the different services and
institutes operating in the civilian environment for various
emergency scenarios, while implementing the lessons learned
during the conflict in Lebanon in the summer of 2006," the army
said in a statement.


Among the scenarios is a chemical warhead strike on the main
commercial city of Tel Aviv, rocket strikes on a power station
and Ben Gurion international airport, and suicide bombing attacks
in schools.


Authorities said sirens would sound across the country at 2 pm
(1200 GMT) on Tuesday, blasts would be heard periodically
throughout the day, and warned that traffic jams could be
expected.
