South Korean shares closed slightly higher Tuesday with investors
awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee
meeting, dealers said.


Initial sentiment was bolstered by Wall Street's overnight rally,
but the market moved back and forth with some profit-taking by
institutions after three consecutive sessions of solid gains.


Banks enjoyed sustained interest from foreign investors amid a
strong quarterly earnings outlook, dealers added.


The KOSPI index ended up 0.78 points or 0.05 percent at 1,444.17.
