Japan's Mizuho Financial Group on Tuesday cut its net profit
forecast by 25 percent for the year to March 2007 due to bigger
write-off costs and reduced profits from stock dealings.


Japan's second-largest banking group said its net profit for the
fiscal year was now forecast at 540 billion yen (4.6 billion
dollars), compared with the 720 billion yen projected earlier.


The revision was "mainly due to an increase in credit-related
costs, a decrease in net gains related to stocks as well as other
factors," the banking group said in a statement.


In July, Mizuho completed the repayment of public funds borrowed
during a government bailout of major lenders in the late 1990s
aimed at stabilising the country's financial system in the face
of crippling bad debt problems.
