Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will visit Turkey this week for
talks on bilateral and international issues, including the Middle
East and Iraq, a Turkish statement said Tuesday.


Mubarak will hold talks with Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
and other senior officials during the March 22-23 visit, the
statement from Sezer's office said.


The Egyptian president last visited Turkey in February 2004.


The trip comes amid mounting Western pressure on the new
Palestinian government -- grouping the radical Hamas movement and
Western-backed moderates -- to renounce violence and recognise
Israel's right to exist.


Muslim-majority but secular Turkey is the Israel's main regional
ally but also enjoys close ties with the Palestinians and
supports their claims for statehood.


Turkey and Egypt are engaged in close dialogue over Iraq and
agree that its territorial integrity must be preserved.
