Two workers suffered minor injuries when they were exposed to
radiation at a South Korean nuclear power plant, the operators
said Tuesday.


"Two people received slight burns on their feet from waste water
as they were engaged in routine maintenance work," said a
spokesperson for state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co.


"They had blisters on their feet. But their exposure to
radioactivity was just one 2,000th of the annually permitted
exposure for workers," she said.


The level of radioactive contamination did not require special
quarantine measures, she said.


The accident happened on Monday inside an auxiliary building near
the Gori One reactor. It had no impact on the operation of the
reactor and no radioactive waste water was leaked, the
spokesperson said.


Gori Reactor One became operational in 1978 and its design life
cycle is to end this year, requiring authorities to consider
whether to dismantle it or continue using it.


It is one of four operating reactors at the Gori Nuclear Power
Plant, near the southeastern city of Busan.


The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy sent inspectors to
determine if workers and supervisors followed safety regulations.


South Korea's four nuclear plants have 20 nuclear reactors that
provide 40 percent of the country's electricity needs.
