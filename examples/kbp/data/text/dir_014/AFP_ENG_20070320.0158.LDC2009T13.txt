Russia coach Guus Hiddink on Tuesday called up Saint Petersburg
midfielder Konstantin Zyryanov and Torpedo Moscow goalkeeper
Dmitry Borodin for next weekend's Euro 2008 qualifier against
Estonia after four players were sidelined with injuries.


CSKA full back Alexei Berezutsy, Dynamo defender Denis Kolodin
and midfielder Igor Semshov were all injured during Sunday's
Moscow derby.


Saint Petersburg goalie Vyacheslav Malafeyev will also miss
Saturday's Group E match at Tallinn because of a severe cold.
