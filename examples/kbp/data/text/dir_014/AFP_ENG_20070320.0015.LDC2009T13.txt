About 200 Jewish settlers were occupying a house near the
flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron on Tuesday that they claim to
have bought off a Palestinian.


A large Israeli force of police and soldiers was surrounding the
three-storey building on a road linking Hebron to the Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba after the settlers moved in late
Monday.


A police spokesman said they were checking the validity of the
settlers' documents laying claim to the home.


"If this house was bought legally, the occupants can stay but if
they do not have the necessary papers they will be expelled," he
added.


Around 600 hardline Israeli settlers live in a tightly-guarded
enclave in Hebron, a city in the southern West Bank that is also
home to around 170,000 Palestinians.
