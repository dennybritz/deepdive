Japanese share prices closed up 0.90 percent Tuesday as overnight
gains on Wall Street and a softer yen provided a further boost to
recovering investor sentiment, dealers said.


They said a decision by Japan's central bank to leave its
benchmark interest rate on hold at 0.5 percent had little impact
on the market.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index of leading
shares gained 153.65 points to 17,163.20.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section advanced 14.21 points or 0.84 percent to 1,708.29.


The Tokyo market will be closed on Wednesday for a public
holiday.
