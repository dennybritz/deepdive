Egypt's parliament has passed a series of controversial
constitutional amendments the government says will strengthen
democracy but which the opposition brands an effort to prop up
the regime.


The ruling National Democratic Party, which holds more than three
quarters of the seats in parliament, voted overwhelmingly in
favour of the amendments to 34 articles of the constitution late
on Monday.


A popular referendum will be held on March 26 to approve the
changes.


About 100 opposition lawmakers, mainly from the Islamist Muslim
Brotherhood, boycotted the discussions over the amendments.


While many of the amendments simply remove outdated socialist
language dating from earlier regimes, key modifications now
enshrine in the constitution extraordinary powers for security
forces to fight terrorism.
