Australian share prices closed 0.4 percent higher Tuesday on the
back of a strong positive lead from Wall Street and fresh
domestic merger and acquisition activity, dealers said.


The benchmark SP/ASX 200 added 23.2 points at 5,882.9 while the
broader All Ordinaries index rose 22.4 points to 5,861.7.
