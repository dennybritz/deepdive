Six suspected Islamic militants and two Indian army soldiers,
including an officer, were killed during two  gunbattles in
Indian-administered Kashmir, police said Tuesday.


In the first firefight, four rebels and two soldiers were killed.


"The fighting erupted late Monday when counter-insurgency police
and army troops raided a hideout in Kupwara district," a police
spokesman said.


The area borders the Pakistani zone of the disputed Himalayan
state.


He said in the initial burst of firing by the militants an army
captain and a soldier were hurt.


"The injured later died in a hospital," the spokesman said,
adding four rebels were killed in the ensuing gunbattle, which
lasted for 10 hours.


Indian troops shot dead two more militants in the southern
district of Pulwama late Monday, police said.


The six slain rebels belonged to hardline groups Lashkar-e-Toiba
and Harkat-ul- Mujahedin.


Violence has dipped in Kashmir since India and Pakistan -- which
both hold the region in part but claim it in full -- started a
peace process in January 2004.


The daily death toll has dropped from 10 in 2001 to three in
2006.


The unrest has claimed nearly 44,000 lives since militants
launched their insurgency against Indian rule in 1989.
