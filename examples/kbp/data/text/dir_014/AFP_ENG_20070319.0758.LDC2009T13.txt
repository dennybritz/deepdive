Huachen Automotive Group, parent of Hong Kong-listed Brilliance
China, plans to spend three billion yuan (390 million dollars) on
new car development this year to expand at home and abroad, state
media said Tuesday.


The group, which operates a joint venture with German car maker
BMW through the listed unit, is targeting three new models under
its own brand, including a subcompact, a compact and a wagon, the
China Daily reported.


The ambitious plan comes as Huachen struggles to become
profitable after having been in the red the past years because of
sluggish sales and price wars, according to the newspaper.


The group, which is based in the northeast Chinese city of
Shenyang, is in talks with a US firm to ship its cars to North
America, the newspaper said, citing Huachen Chairman Qi Yumin. It
gave no further details.


North America has also been targeted by many of Huachen's Chinese
peers, such as Chery, Geely and Chang'an.


In November, the group cut a deal with a German auto trader to
sell 158,000 Zhonghua sedans in Europe by 2011, the biggest
overseas deal pulled so far by a Chinese auto maker.
