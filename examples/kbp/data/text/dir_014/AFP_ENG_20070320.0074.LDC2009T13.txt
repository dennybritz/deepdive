Two car bombs targeting commercial areas in Baghdad killed five
people and wounded dozens on Tuesday, medics and security
officials said, as Iraq marked the fourth anniversary of the US-
led invasion.


Four people were killed and 21 wounded when a car bomb exploded
in the Sheikh Omar industrial area of central Baghdad, a security
official said.


The explosion occurred at 10:15 am (0715 GMT).


Another car bomb attack killed one person and wounded six in an
automobile spare parts market, a medic said.


The explosion occurred at 7:20 am in Mujamma al-Misham market in
south Baghdad, well known for selling tyres, batteries and other
spare parts.


Insurgents have managed to carry out car bombings in Baghdad
despite a massive security crackdown in the capital since
February.


About 90,000 US and Iraqi troops are patrolling the streets of
Baghdad to curb insurgent and sectarian violence.
