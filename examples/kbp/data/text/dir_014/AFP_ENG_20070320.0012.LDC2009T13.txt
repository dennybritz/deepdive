European 200m breaststroke champion Kirsty Balfour has conceded
that Australian world record holder Leisel Jones will be
unstoppable at the World Swimming Championships.


Jones holds the records over 100m and 200m and is hot favourite
to take both titles in Melbourne.


"Realistically, you can say Leisel is likely to win and then
there are three battling for the next places," Balfour, whose
best 200m time is almost four seconds behind Jones, told
reporters.


Nevertheless Balfour, who broke through last year by claiming the
European title, said she was not afraid of Jones and looked
forward to giving her a race.


"I don't feel daunted, I admire her," said the Scot. "I think
it's good to have someone so good as a swimmer as she pushes
everyone else."


Despite the burden of being the favourite for both events, Jones
said she is relaxed heading into the eight-day swimming
competition starting Sunday.


"It's actually quite strange that I'm feeling really relaxed,"
said the 21-year- old.


"I've never had this feeling before and it is sort of the case
that it doesn't feel like I'm racing yet which is good and I
haven't wasted energy being nervous.


"It's the perfect thing for me being relaxed and I feel like I'm
just doing my thing, it's fantastic."


The women's 200m breaststroke final takes place here on March 30.
