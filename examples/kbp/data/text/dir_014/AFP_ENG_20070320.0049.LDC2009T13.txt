Philippine shares closed flat Tuesday as investors fretted about
the outlook for interest rates despite solid gains on Wall Street
and in the regional markets, dealers said.


Profit-taking in Globe Telecom Inc and Megaworld Corp outweighed
gains in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT), the
dealers added.


The composite index was down 2.07 points at 3,039.31 after moving
between 2,990.46 and 3,075.11.


The broader all-share index rose 0.83 points to 1,971.14.


Gainers beat losers 59 to 35, while 64 stocks ended unchanged.


Volume amounted to 3.8 billion shares worth 2.1 billion pesos
(43.2 million dollars.)


The Philippine peso traded at 48.603 to the dollar.


"There are already very strong indications by the central bank
that it is leaning towards a tightening of rates," said Ron
Rodrigo of Unicapital Securities Inc.


"This will keep investors cautious, if not (cause them to) stay
altogether on the sidelines, unless there are more positive
developments," he added.


Last week, the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 7.5 percent. Since last November, this rate has been
applicable only to banks' overnight placements of up to five
billion pesos.


Top-traded PLDT gained 10 pesos to 2,295 pesos while its rival
Globe Telecom Inc fell 50 pesos to 1,295 pesos.


Property developer Megaworld Corp shed five centavos to 2.90
pesos while conglomerate Ayala Corp was steady at 545 pesos.


Food and beverage firm San Miguel Corp's A and B shares also
closed steady at 63.50 and 72.00 pesos, respectively.
