Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip launched a 24-hour
strike on Tuesday in protest at the kidnapping a week ago of BBC
correspondent Alan Johnston.


"All journalists in the Gaza Strip are observing the strike,"
said Wael al- Dahdub of their union's committee for the
protection of journalists.


He called on the Palestinian Authority to use all the means at
its disposal to secure the release of Johnston, condemning the
kidnapping as an "immoral act".


In the West Bank political capital of Ramallah, foreign and local
journalists had staged a sit-in on Monday.


The BBC has appealed for help to find the veteran 44-year-old
British correspondent who was kidnapped in Gaza City at gunpoint
on March 12 as he drove home from work.


"As time passes, we are growing increasingly concerned about
Alan's safety," it said on Monday.


Johnston, who was previously posted to Afghanistan and
Uzbekistan, was one of the few Western journalists still based in
the increasingly lawless Gaza Strip.


Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and Hamas, the majority party
in the new unity government, have condemned the abduction, the
latest in a spate of kidnappings that has seen around 20
foreigners seized over the past year.


Hostages are frequently used as bargaining chips to gain
concessions from the Palestinian Authority and so far all have
been released unharmed.
