Six policemen in central China have been charged with homicide
for throwing a man to his death from a three-storey building in
exchange for a lavish meal, state media reported on Tuesday.


The six officers in Henan province's Zhoukou city were asked in
2004 by an acquaintance named Lu Liusheng to beat up a person
with whom Lu's family had an unspecified dispute, the Beijing
Morning Post reported.


Lu promised the officers a banquet-style meal to which he also
invited the intended victim, Li Shengli, the paper said.


After the meal, the officers took Li to their station, where he
was beaten. Li was then thrown to his death from the window of a
third-floor bathroom to prevent him reporting the attack, and the
officers claimed the death was a suicide.


Following a lengthy investigation, Zhoukou city authorities
charged the six officers, as well as Lu, with homicide in the
case, the paper said.


It did not say when the charges were issued.
