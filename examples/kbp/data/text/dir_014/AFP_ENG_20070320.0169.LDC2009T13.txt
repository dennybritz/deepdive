The UN envoy for Kosovo, Martti Ahtisaari, advocates independence
for the Albanian-populated Serb province, the French newspaper Le
Monde said Tuesday quoting excerpts from his confidential report.


"Independence under international supervision is the only viable
option" for Kosovo, Ahtisaari said in the report that was sent to
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon last week.


The UN Security Council will be asked in the coming weeks to
consider the plan put forward by Ahtisaari following the failure
of year-long talks between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians.
