New Zealand share prices closed 0.22 percent lower Tuesday,
dragged down by market leader Telecom, dealers said.


The benchmark NZX-50 index fell 8.69 points to 4,041.61 on
turnover of 128.3 million dollars (90.1 million US).


Telecom fell eight cents to 4.55 dollars, a day after an
Australian company it has invested in -- Hutchison
Telecommunications -- said it planned to raise up to 2.85 billion
Australian dollars (2.3 billion US).


Telecom holds 19.9 percent of Hutchison subsidiary H3GA. There is
speculation Telecom would have to invest up to 300 million
Australian dollars to maintain its shareholding.


"We haven't had it confirmed that they're putting money in, but
you've seen them previously put a lot of money in (to Australia)
and not a lot of return, and people are talking a little bit
cynically about that," said David Price, of Forsyth Barr.


Telecom has lost heavily on its Australian unit AAPT in recent
years.


Fletcher Building rose two cents to 10.86 dollars and Contact
Energy rose three cents to 9.03. Fisher & Paykel Healthcare
lost four cents to 3.88 dollars and sister company Fisher and
Paykel Appliances was flat at 3.72.


Air New Zealand rose nine cents to 2.12 dollars after announcing
positive operating figures.


"The yield on their long-haul appeared to be very strong, the
strongest we've seen for quite some time," Price said.


Discount retailer The Warehouse fell five cents to 6.78 dollars,
Auckland Airport was down three cents to 2.33, TrustPower rose 10
cents to 8.20 and parent Infratil was up five cents at 5.50.
