A court in eastern China has upheld prison sentences for two
bogus cataract surgeons whose bungled operations resulted in nine
people having their eyeballs removed.


Brothers Sui Guorong and Sui Guoliang were sentenced to jail
terms of six and five years respectively in November for
illegally performing cataract surgery on 10 people in December
2005, Xinhua news agency said.


Nine of their patients developed eye infections that forced the
removal of their eyeballs, it said.


Sui Guorong also was fined 300,000 yuan (38,750 dollars) and his
brother fined 200,000 yuan.


They appealed the verdicts shortly after the trial, at a court in
Suzhou city in Anhui province.


Xu Qing, an ophthalmologist at Suzhou's No. 9 People's Hospital,
colluded with the brothers by allowing them use of hospital
facilities for the procedures.


Xu has been punished separately, Xinhua said, offering no
details.
