A moderate quake with a magnitude of 5.3 rocked areas in the
southern Philippines Tuesday, but there were no reports of damage
or casualties.


The quake's epicenter was located 30 kilometers (18.6 miles)
northeast of the coast of Tandag on Surigao del Sur province on
the main southern island of Mindanao, the state volcanology and
seismology institute said.


It was felt in varying intensities in seven towns and cities, it
said, but there was no damage to property and no tsunami warning
was issued.


The Philippines sits on what is commonly referred to as the
Pacific "ring of fire," a zone of frequent earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions that encircles the Pacific Ocean basin.


The South East Asian archipelago nation of 86 million people is
hit daily by earthquakes that are relatively low in magnitude and
cause little or no structural damage.


The last major earthquake to hit the Philippines was on July 16,
1990, when a quake of 7.7 magnitude shattered the northern Luzon
city of Baguio, killing or injuring an estimated 1,000 people.
