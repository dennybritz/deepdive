Sixty-five people were killed and seven injured in the west
African state of Guinea after a lorry they were travelling in
overturned into a lake, medical and police sources said Tuesday.


The accident took place late Monday near the town of Gueckedou,
about 700 kilometres (400 miles) southeast of the capital.


"The vehicle overturned into a lake. There were 65 dead," said a
doctor at Gueckedou hospital, who asked not be named.


The truck, carrying 72 people, was heading to a weekly market in
Koudou, 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Gueckedou, near the
border with Sierra Leone.


A police source said the truck was overloaded.


Of the dead, 39 were women, eight of them pregnant, said the
doctor.


The driver and six passengers who were seriously injured were
taken to Gueckedou hospital.
