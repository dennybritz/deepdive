A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Tuesday sentenced an Islamic
cleric to death for shooting dead a female minister because she
was not wearing a veil, officials said.


Mohammad Sarwar was convicted and sentenced at the court in the
central city of Gujranwala a month after he gunned down at a
public meeting Zilla Huma Usman, the social welfare minister for
Punjab province.


"Judge Tariq Iftikhar has sentenced Sarwar to death on two
counts, one for the murder of Zilla Huma and the other for
spreading terrorism by the action," court official Amjad Ali told
AFP.


Sarwar was also ordered to pay a fine of 200,000 rupees (3,333
dollars), he said.


The bearded 40-year-old cleric did not react when the judge read
out the sentence. He was taken away by police under heavy
security.


The killing fuelled fears about the increased Islamisation of
Pakistan and brought strong condemnation from the country's
moderate President Pervez Musharraf, who has vowed to tackle
religious extremism.


The cleric told police after the murder on February 20 that he
killed Usman because she was not wearing Islamic dress including
a veil and that he opposed the involvement of women in politics.


Police have said Sarwar, a father of nine who was educated at an
Islamic seminary, was earlier arrested in 2003 after confessing
to murdering four prostitutes, but was let off due to lack of
evidence.
