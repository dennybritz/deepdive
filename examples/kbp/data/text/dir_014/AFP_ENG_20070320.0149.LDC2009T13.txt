At least 28 people were killed and 14 injured Tuesday when a
Bangkok-bound bus caught fire and careened down a hillside in
central Thailand, police said.


The bus from the northeastern province of Yasothorn caught fire
on a major four- lane highway in the central province of
Saraburi, about 105 kilometres (65 miles) north of here, police
said.


After the fire broke out, the bus veered off the road and crashed
down a hillside, police added.


"Twenty-eight died, and their bodies were burned beyond
recognition. An estimated 14 people were injured," police
Lieutenant Colonel Samran Soreekul told AFP from the accident
site.


The victims have not been identified, but Samran said police did
not believe any of them were foreigners because the bus route did
not lead to any major tourist destinations.


The cause of fire is still unknown, he added.
