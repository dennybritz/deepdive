British police arrested a teenage boy Tuesday after the death of
15-year-old Adam Regis in the latest of a wave of fatal stabbings
in London.


Regis, nephew of retired Olympic sprinter John Regis, was found
by his grandmother with stab wounds late Saturday in east London,
near the ground of Premiership football club West Ham.


He was taken to hospital but later died of his injuries.


"At approximately 7:45 am (0745 GMT) today, officers attended an
address in East Ham and arrested a youth believed aged in his
teens in connection with the inquiry," London's Metropolitan
Police said in a statement.


Regis's death came amid growing concern among politicians that
there is a knife and gun culture among young people in the
British capital.


Last week, another young Briton, Kodjo Yenga, was killed in a
knife attack in Hammersmith, west London.


And last month, armed police went on patrol in some parts of
London after the fatal shootings of four youngsters within days.


Prime Minister Tony Blair called the killings "horrific, shocking
and tragic beyond belief" and said there was a "specific problem"
among some groups of young people.
