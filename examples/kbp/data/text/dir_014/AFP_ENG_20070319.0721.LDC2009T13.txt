US logistics giant FedEx said Tuesday it will offer next-
business-day domestic express service in China in a bid to take
advantage of the country's fast- growing economy.


The new service, beginning on May 28, will offer next-day
delivery services both within China and around the world.


"Up to 90 percent of existing FedEx customers in China have
expressed the need for a reliable domestic express service," said
Eddy Chan, senior vice president of FedEx China.


"This is a strong signal to us that many companies view domestic
express service in China as a catalyst for growth and
competitiveness in this exploding market," he added.


FedEx said its domestic express network includes a new hub at
Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport in East China's Zhejiang
province which will initially be able to sort up to 9,000
packages per hour.
