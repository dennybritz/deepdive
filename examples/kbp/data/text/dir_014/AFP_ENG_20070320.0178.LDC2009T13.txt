Olympic champions Anastasia Davydova and Anastasia Ermakova
claimed their third world title in the synchronised swimming
technical duet on Tuesday.


Davydova and Ermakova delivered an immaculate performance to win
the gold with 98.833 points from Spain's Gemma Mengual Civil and
Paola Tirados Sanchez with 97.500.


Japan's Saho Harada and Emiko Suzuki took the bronze with 97.167.


Yet again the Russian pair were dazzling and followed up teammate
Natalia Ischenko's win in the solo technical event on Monday.


"We finally showed what we're capable of -- unlike at the World
Cup in September (Yokohama, Japan 2006) -- we finally proved what
we can do," Ermakova said.


"We decided the programme isn't too old, plus we all like it and
really wanted to show that in this specific programme we could
get the marks."


The Anastasias' skills were unmatched in precision and control.


Asked whether their duet technical performance had any mistakes,
Davydova said: "Of course, our coach found mistakes, but we won't
tell those to anyone -- if you didn't spot them, that's not our
problem!"


Spanish team coach Ana Tarres Campa said she was proud of Civil
and Sanchez's silver medal performance.


"This is a new pairing so we weren't sure how they would perform
together," she said.


"We were a little bit worried after the preliminaries where they
had some technical problems, but today it all came together and
I'm very proud of them."


China's Jiang Tingting and Jiang Wenwen were fourth with 96.000
with the American team of Christina Jones and Annabelle Orme
fifth with 95.167.
