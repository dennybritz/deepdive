Malaysia's western Selangor state has launched a clean-up of its
massage parlours to curb illicit sex and the spread of diseases
amid a tourism drive, a report said Tuesday.


Selangor's chief minister, Mohamad Khir Toyo, said only certified
masseuses would be allowed to work and operate spas, which would
help shut down illegal, sex-oriented massage parlours.


"Most people want a good rub down, someone to knead their aching
muscles. Our regulations ensure that the massage parlours provide
authentic massage and not entice their customers into vice
activities," he was quoted as saying in the Star daily.


"From May, those wanting to work as a masseuse in the state must
have a certificate from a certified training centre," he said.


Besides being certified, masseuses in Selangor, one of Malaysia's
more wealthy and developed states, will have to undergo medical
tests to make sure they are disease-free.


"We want to ensure that the masseuse who has close contact with
the customers does not pass on a disease," he said.


Khir said the clean-up was also necessary with massage gaining
recognition as an alternative therapy and an expected influx of
tourists to Malaysia this year amid a nationwide tourism push.


"With Visit Malaysia Year, tourists visiting Selangor should be
treated to the best massage techniques," he said.


Malaysian massage parlours have traditionally had a sleazy
reputation as fronts for illegal sex workers.


However, like its neighbours Thailand and Indonesia, Malaysia has
become home to an increasing number of spas and health resorts as
wealthy Malaysians seek massages to alleviate stress.
