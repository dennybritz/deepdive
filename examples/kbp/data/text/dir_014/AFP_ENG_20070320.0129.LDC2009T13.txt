Japan's red-faced weathermen declared the cherry blossom season
open in Tokyo on Tuesday, an excuse for drunken revelry across
the country but an annual headache for the forecasters.


Predicting the cherry blossoms has become one of the most closely
watched duties of the Meteorological Agency, which was all
apologies last week after prematurely predicting the start of the
season.


Millions of Japanese wine and dine each year at parties under the
cherry trees, whose delicate but short-lived blossoms have left
poets over the centuries pondering the ephemeral nature of
beauty.


In the end, the white and pink blossoms arrived two days earlier
than expected, sparing the weathermen any further blushes.


"There are trees we always monitor to confirm the arrival of the
blossom season," said a weather agency official. "We confirmed
some buds have opened on the trees today."


The cherry blossoms arrived in Tokyo eight days earlier than
average due to an unusually mild winter, the agency said.


Tokyo experienced its first snowless winter since records began
in 1876, with the first snow seen only last Friday, which
officially counts as spring.
