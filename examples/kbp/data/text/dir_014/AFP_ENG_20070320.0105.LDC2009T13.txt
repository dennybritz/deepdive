China's industrial output expanded 12.6 percent in February
compared with a year ago, the government said Tuesday.


The monthly rise in production at industrial enterprises compares
with a 12.5 percent increase in all of 2006, according to new
data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.


Last week China's statisticians reported an 18.5 percent jump in
output in the first two months of 2007, a rise that analysts
widely believe suggests economic acceleration.


No separate figure for January was provided.


For some statistics, China publishes combined figures for the
first two months of the year to minimise the distortion of the
week-long break for the Lunar New Year holiday.


This year the holiday fell in mid-February, while last year it
came at the end of January.
