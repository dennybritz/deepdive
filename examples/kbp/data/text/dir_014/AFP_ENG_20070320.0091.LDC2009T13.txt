The Swiss chocolate maker, Lindt & Spruengli, on Tuesday
announced a record 21 percent increase in annual net profits to
209 million Swiss francs (130 million euros, 173 million
dollars).


Sales in 2006 in North America exceeded the 500 million Swiss
francs mark for the first time, contributing to a 15.1 percent
increase in global sales to 2.59 billion Swiss francs, the
company said in a statement.


Lindt said its business growth last year had "outpaced the growth
of the overall chocolate market many times over."


Operational earnings, before interest and taxes (EBIT), grew by
19.4 percent to 296.9 million Swiss francs, the highest increase
in the company's history.


Lindt's board is proposing a 22.2 percent increase in dividend
payments of 275 Swiss francs per registered share.
