A Pakistani deputy attorney general and a judge resigned Tuesday
in protest at President Pervez Musharraf's removal of the chief
justice, deepening the crisis facing the country's military
ruler.


Deputy Attorney General Nasir Saeed Sheikh became the most senior
state lawyer to quit amid a wave of resignations by judges and
legal figures over the March 9 suspension of top judge Iftikhar
Muhammad Chaudhry.


"Yes I have resigned," Sheikh told AFP. "Under the prevailing
constitutional position it is not possible for me to work."


Separately Javed Memon, a senior civil judge in the town of Kotri
in southern Sindh province, became the eighth judge to resign
over the growing controversy.


Memon had sent notice of his resignation to the registrar of
Sindh High Court, a court official said on condition of
anonymity.


Five judges resigned in Sindh on Monday, as well as a high court
judge in central Punjab province. A civil judge in the central
Pakistani city of Bahawalpur and a public prosecutor said they
were quitting last week.


Violent protests broke out in Islamabad and Lahore last week over
Chaudhry's removal.


Musharraf defended his decision in an interview late Monday and
said he would not impose a state of emergency over the growing
unrest, or delay elections due later this year or early next.


Lawyers and hardline Islamic parties have called for further,
nationwide protests when Chaudhry appears again before the
Supreme Judicial Council on Wednesday.
