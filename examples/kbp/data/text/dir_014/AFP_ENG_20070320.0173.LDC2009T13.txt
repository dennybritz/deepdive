India's top generic drug firm Ranbaxy Laboratories has pulled out
of the race to buy the generic drugs business of German
pharmaceutical and chemical giant Merck KGaA, a report said
Tuesday.


The Indian drugmaker baulked at a prospective price of more than
six billion dollars (4.5 billion euros), the Press Trust of India
reported, quoting unnamed sources.


"We are bound by a confidentiality agreement so we cannot comment
on this," a Ranbaxy Laboratories spokesman told AFP.


Ranbaxy shares rose 19.50 rupees or 6.15 percent to 336.35 rupees
on the Mumbai stock exchange Tuesday after the report while the
benchmark Sensex index gained 60.95 points or 0.48 percent to
12,705.94.


Last week, Ranbaxy announced that it had made a "non-binding" bid
for the Merck Generics Business at "a value it considers fair and
reasonable."


"We are not in a rat race for acquisitions but are focused on
creating value for our shareholders," company CEO Malvinder Singh
had said in the statement.


Another major Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's pulled out of the race
last week, saying the company was not ready for "such a big-sized
deal".


Merck KGaA has said it is considering selling its generic drugs
-- versions of established, more common treatments not covered by
patents -- in a move that could help finance its acquisition of
Swiss biotechnology company Serono that it bought this year.


It is believed to want to concentrate on patent-protected drugs
instead.
