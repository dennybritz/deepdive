The British military handed over a key base in the southern city
of Basra to local forces on Tuesday as part of its gradual
withdrawal from war-torn Iraq, a provincial official said.


Al-Saee base, known as the Old State Building, was handed over to
Iraqi forces after having served as headquarters of British
troops in Basra since the US-led invasion exactly four years ago.


"This is the first step by the Iraqis to take over the entire
security in Basra," provincial governor Mohammed Musabah al-
Waeili said at a ceremony to lower the Union Jack and raise the
Iraqi flag on top of the building.


The British troops also plan to withdraw from the waterfront
Shatt al-Arab Hotel base in the near future but will remain in
the city to protect the consulate at Basra palace and at a large
base at the airport.


Shatt al-Arab Hotel and the Old State Building come under almost
daily rocket and mortar attacks from the Shiite militia groups
battling to control southern Iraq.


Last month British Prime Minister Tony Blair told parliament the
7,200-strong British force in and around Basra would be cut by
1,600 troops and likely drop to 5,000 by the end of the year.


But he said British troops would stay around Basra into 2008 to
help Iraqi forces in a support role "for as long as we are wanted
and have a job to do."
