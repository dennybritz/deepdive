Police seized heroin worth 220 million rupees (five million
dollars) near India's largest Tibetan refugee enclave in New
Delhi, officials here said Tuesday.


Police officials said 22 kilograms (44 pounds) of the drug were
recovered and three alleged narcotics dealers arrested in a well-
planned crackdown over the weekend.


The haul was made in Majnu ka Tilla district, which houses more
than 10,000 Tibetan refugees. Police said the suspects were all
Indians, and the main suspect was still being hunted.
