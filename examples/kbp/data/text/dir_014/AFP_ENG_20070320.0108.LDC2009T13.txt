A blockbuster bid by British bank Barclays to merge with ABN Amro
and create the world's fifth-largest bank pushed up the Dutch
bank's share price dramatically on Tuesday.


Shares in ABN Amro, which is listed on the Amsterdam stock
exchange, surged 4.24 percent to 31.21 euros in early deals,
after a 9.6 percent jump the previous day. Barclays stock gained
1.92 percent to 690 pence in London.


The two banks has revealed late Monday that they were in
"exclusive" talks over a possible merger that would create a
group with a market capitalisation of more than 160 billion
dollars (120 billion euros).


"Barclays PLC confirms that it is in exclusive preliminary
discussions with ABN Amro Holding NV concerning a potential
combination of the two organisations which will create value for
both sets of shareholders," Barclays said in a statement.


"These discussions are the result of careful consideration to
create a highly complementary partnership," it said.


A takeover by Barclays of ABN Amro would create the world's
fifth-biggest behind Citigroup, Bank of America, both of the
United States, China's ICBC and British rival HSBC.


The combined enterprise would have 47 million clients and employ
220,000 people in 50 countries.
