Police in South Korea have vowed to crack down on rogue
motorcyclists, who terrorise locals and foreigners alike by
speeding along city pavements and across pedestrian crossings.


"The practice is the source of many complaints by foreign
visitors to Korea," Tuesday's JoongAng Daily noted.


National police will launch a crackdown from early May following
a rise in motorbike accidents from 10,269 in 2004 to 13,635 last
year, it said.


Helmetless riders and bikes making excessive noise will also be
targeted.
