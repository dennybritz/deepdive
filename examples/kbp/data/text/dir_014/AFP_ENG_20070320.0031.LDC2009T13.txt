Couples intending to tie the knot in an Indonesian district in
West Java have begun arriving at the local marriage registry
office clutching trees as part of a reforestation drive.


Lily Hambali Hasan, the head of Purwakarta district, had called
on the couples, and promoted government workers, to donate
seedlings to boost tree cover.


He made the call two years ago but the initiative has caught on
with officials only recently, helping to replant some 8,750
hectares (21,630 acres), according to Hasan's figures.


"No regulation has been issued, this is just a call by the
district chief, but in practice it may have become obligatory in
some cases," Asep Gumelar, a Purwakarta spokesman, told AFP.


Couples typically brought a couple of seedlings or other crops
with them to the marriage office, he said, and forestry officials
distributed them for planting free of charge.


"Any official getting a rank promotion also has to donate trees,"
Gumelar said. "How many depends on the rank, but usually it
varies between two to five."
