Italian police said they arrested nearly 200 suspected members of
the Neapolitan mafia, the Camorra, in a dawn sweep Tuesday
involving around 1,000 officers.


"Prosecutors issued around 200 arrest warrants and we acted on
180" a spokesman for the press service of Italy's financial
police said.


"Most of these people were accused of drug dealing but some are
also accused of trafficking. In some cases we arrested whole
families," the spokesman added.


The arrested people belong to the two historic clans of the
Camorra, which control the drug trade in central Naples, the
Guiliano and the Mazzarella clans.
