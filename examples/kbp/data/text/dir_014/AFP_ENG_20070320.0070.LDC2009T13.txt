Bangladesh will set up a national human rights commission as soon
as possible to deal with all rights issues in the emergency-ruled
South Asian country, a government spokesman said Tuesday.


The country's cabinet, led by interim government chief Fakhruddin
Ahmed, took the decision at a meeting late Monday, government
spokesman Syed Fahim Munaim told AFP.


"The government will set up the commission as soon as possible
because we are a member of the United Nations human rights body.
It will deal with all the human rights issues in the country," he
said.


The decision came after right groups said extra-judicial killings
by law enforcers had continued under the military-backed
caretaker government, with at least 50 unexplained deaths since
it took power on January 12.


There were around 300 similar deaths over the previous six
months. Authorities say the deaths occur when suspects resist
arrest, try to escape or force personnel to act in self-defence.


Rights groups, however, have called for independent inquiries
into each killing.


On January 11, president Iajuddin Ahmed stepped down as head of
the previous interim government, cancelled disputed elections and
imposed an emergency.


The new caretaker government has pledged to clean up the
country's notoriously corrupt politics before holding credible
elections.
