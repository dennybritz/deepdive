More than 140,000 people are expected to play cricket in
Australia on Wednesday in a celebration of "Harmony Day", which
aims to bring the country's races, cultures and religions closer
together.


"A total of 895 schools and community groups with an estimated
141,467 participants will occupy local sporting fields, school
grounds and ovals around Australia to celebrate cultural
diversity and unity through Australia's favourite sport,
cricket," officials said Tuesday.


Harmony Day is a government initiative celebrated on March 21
each year to coincide with the International Day for the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination.


"The CricKids Australia's Biggest Cricket Game is about providing
the opportunity for all Australians to join in a sport that is
part of Australia's history and culture," said Cricket Australia
chief executive James Sutherland.


It is the first time the game has been organised for Harmony Day
and "we've been quite overwhelmed by number of people who have
signed up," a spokeswoman told AFP. "We had projected only
25,000."


Cricket Australia claims in its statement that "the participation
figure is a record for the most people playing informal cricket
on one day".


The game comes as the government prepares to pass new laws making
it harder to become an Australian citizen, including a pledge of
commitment to "Australian values".
