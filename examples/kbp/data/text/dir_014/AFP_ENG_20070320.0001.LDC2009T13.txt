Hong Kong share prices ended the Tuesday morning session 0.49
percent higher, extending Monday's gains on expectations of
strong results from blue chips such as China Mobile, dealers
said.


They said a rebound on Wall Street bolstered sentiment although
the gains were capped by caution ahead of a US Federal Reserve
policy meeting and worries that China might adopt more tightening
measures following an interest rate hike announced over the
weekend.


The Hang Seng Index closed the morning up 93.96 points at
19,360.70, off a high of 19,463.90 and a low of 19,332.60.
