The Asian Tour added another golf tournament in China to its
schedule Tuesday, acknowledging the growth of professional golf
in the booming nation.


Beijing will host the Pine Valley Open next month, meaning the
country is now home to five Asian Tour events.


The latest addition will offer a lucrative 500,000 US dollars in
prize money and will take place between April 26-29, following on
from the BMW Asian Open and the Volvo China Open in a three-week
golf fest.


"The launch of the Pine Valley Beijing Open is another huge boost
for the game in Asia," said the Asian Tour's executive chairman
Kyi Hla Han.


"China continues to pave the way with new and exciting
tournaments emerging in the mainland."


Chinese stars Zhang Lian-wei and Liang Wen-chong, who recently
triumphed in the Singapore Masters and donated his prize money to
the development of golf in China, will lead the local challenge.


"The growing popularity of golf in China has been evident in
recent years and on behalf of the China Golf Association, we are
delighted to announce the launch of the Pine Valley Beijing
Open," said China Golf Association vice president Zhang Xiaoning.


"With the strengthening of ties with the Asian Tour, we believe
that this tournament has the potential to become one of Beijing's
influential events."
