Pacemen Ben Hilfenhaus and Damien Wright bowled Tasmania into a
strong position over New South Wales on the second day of the
five-day Australian Sheffield Shield cricket final here Tuesday.


Swing king Ben Hilfenhaus claimed 3-79 and Damien Wright 3-38 as
NSW were contained at 207 for eight in reply to Tasmania's 340
all out.


NSW opener Phil Jaques struck a fighting 82 to give his side a
good start but Wright and Luke Butterworth (2-20) backed up their
batting heroics to ensure NSW were under pressure late in the
day.


Wright and Butterworth were largely responsible for NSW's shaky
final session in which they lost 6-70, with allrounder Grant
Lambert unbeaten on 43.


Earlier Tuesday, Butterworth struck 66 in only his fifth game for
Tasmania while Wright smashed 67 to ensure Tasmania posted a
competitive first-innings total after reeling at 94 for five on
Monday's opening day.


Lambert (3-87) took two wickets but quick Doug Bollinger was the
pick of the NSW bowlers with 5-73.
