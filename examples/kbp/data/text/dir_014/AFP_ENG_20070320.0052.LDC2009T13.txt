Three suspected Islamic militants and an Indian army officer were
killed Tuesday during a gunbattle in the north of Indian-
administered Kashmir, police said.


"The fighting erupted late Monday when counter-insurgency police
and army troops raided a hide-out in Kupwara district," a police
spokesman said. The area borders the Pakistani zone of the
disputed Himalayan state.


He said in the initial burst of firing by the militants an army
captain and a soldier were hurt.


"The injured captain later died in a hospital," the spokesman
said, adding three rebels were killed in the ensuing gunbattle.


Violence has dipped in Kashmir since India and Pakistan -- which
hold the region in parts but claim it in full -- started a peace
process in January 2004.


The daily death toll has dropped from 10 in 2001 to three in
2006.


The unrest has claimed nearly 44,000 lives since militants
launched their insurgency against Indian rule in 1989.
