The Football Association confirmed Tuesday they are investigating
incidents at the end of Chelsea's FA Cup quarter-final win at
Tottenham.


Spurs officials will be contacted by the FA after two supporters
ran onto the pitch after the final whistle of the replay at White
Hart Lane on Monday night.


One of the fans threw a punch at England midfielder Frank Lampard
as he celebrated Chelsea's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final replay win.


An FA spokesman said: "These scenes were totally unacceptable and
we will be contacting Spurs as a matter of priority.


"We want to establish what safety and security provisions were in
place for the game and to confirm what action was taken against
the fans who ran onto the pitch.


"We understand that both individuals were arrested and we would
expect them to be given football banning orders."
