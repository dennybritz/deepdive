Nearly two thirds of Britons think the United States and Britain
were wrong to invade Iraq in 2003, according to a poll published
Tuesday.


Some 55 percent of British people feel the country is less safe
now, with only five percent feeling safer since the US-led war to
oust Saddam Hussein, according to the survey by the BBC and
polling institute ICM.


Overall 29 percent backed the decision to go to war, with 60
percent saying it was a mistake.


"Four years on from the war, most people in the country have now
come tothe view that the United States and Britain were wrong to
take military action against Iraq in 2003," said Nick Sparrow of
ICM.


But there would be support for using British troops in overseas
missions such as disaster relief or to stop genocide, "even if
the countries involved do not pose a direct threat to Britain's
national security," he added.


Some 57 percent were in support of this kind of action, while 24
percent opposed it, the poll indicated.


Prime Minister Tony Blair was US President George W. Bush's main
supporter in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, despite public protests
at the time and opposition to the war from key European partners
led by France and Germany.
