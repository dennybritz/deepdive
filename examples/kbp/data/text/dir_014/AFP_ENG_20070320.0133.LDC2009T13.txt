The Australian Rugby Union Tuesday announced the signing of
former rugby league Test back Timana Tahu to a four-year
contract.


Tahu, who will see out this year with his Parramatta club in the
National Rugby League, will play with the NSW Waratahs in the
2008 Super 14 competition, the ARU said.


Tahu, a veteran of 11 State of Origin matches for New South Wales
and five Tests for Australia, had indicated recently he had no
interest in playing rugby.


But his transfer was unveiled late Tuesday as the first high-
profile rugby league convert since Canberra Raiders fullback
Clinton Schifcofske's decision to join the Queensland Reds midway
through last year.
