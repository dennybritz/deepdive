A nine-month-old girl in Hong Kong was infected with a mild
strain of bird flu but has now recovered, the health department
said Tuesday.


A spokeswoman for the department said the girl, whose name was
not disclosed, received hospital treatment for H9 avian flu and
had been discharged.


The spokeswoman said the last case of H9 was a five-year-old boy
in 2003. In 1999, two girls aged four years and 13 months were
also infected with the H9 strain. All three children recovered.


More details of the case will be disclosed later Tuesday.


The H9 strains are less damaging variations of bird flu than the
deadly H5N1 strain that has killed more than 160 people
worldwide, mostly in Southeast Asia, according to the World
Health Organisation.
