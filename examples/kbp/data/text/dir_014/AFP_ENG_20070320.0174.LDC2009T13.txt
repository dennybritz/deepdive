Iraqi security forces have found a hospital southeast of Baghdad
that was used by Al-Qaeda to treat its wounded militants, an
Iraqi military spokesman told AFP on Tuesday.


Brigadier General Qasim al-Musawi said the hospital was found
near the town of Salman Pak in an area called Al-Bawi.


"We found a big hospital used by Al-Qaeda to treat its wounded
terrorists," Musawi said.


"The hospital was deserted" when it was discovered by security
forces near Salman Pak, 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Baghdad.
