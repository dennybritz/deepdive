South African disaster management teams were mopping up Tuesday
after freak storm waves wreaked havoc in the coastal city of
Durban, killing one person and forcing the closure of port
operations.


Thousands of residents of beach-front properties who had headed
inland for safety heaved a sign of relief as weather experts
announced that the giant waves would subside later in the day.


"The situation appears to have calmed down ... it's all under
control, swells have dropped and there is no further flooding
expected today," National Sea Rescue Institute spokesman, Craig
Lambinon, told AFP.


Waves which reached up to eight meters (26 feet) high pounded
Durban on Monday, smashing windows and flooding businesses.


The body of one person who was swept out to sea was found washed
ashore and several other people have been taken to hospital with
injuries.


"There was also substantial damage caused to the houses and
businesses on the coast and harbour, and structural damage to
roads," Lambinon added.


The storm forced the closure of all port operations in Durban and
nearby Richards Bay on Monday night.


Lambinon said the emergency services would remain on standby to
monitor the situation.
