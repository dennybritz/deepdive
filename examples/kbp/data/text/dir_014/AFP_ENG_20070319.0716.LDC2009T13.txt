China's Postal Savings Bank, the nation's fifth-largest lender,
formally began operations Tuesday, state media reported.


The China Postal Savings Bank, created from the nation's 206
-billion-dollar postal savings system, will be headquartered in
Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said.


It has been charged primarily with serving the countryside, home
to 800 million people whose fortunes have lagged those in the
faster developing urban areas.


Analysts believe it will need up to five years to become a full-
fledged commercial bank but, given its size, many expect it will
become a major player in the Chinese financial system.
