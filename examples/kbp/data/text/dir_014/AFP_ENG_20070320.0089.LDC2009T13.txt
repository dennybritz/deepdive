Hong Kong share prices closed 0.47 percent higher Tuesday on
expectations of strong results from blue chips such as China
Mobile and with a rally on Wall Street bolstering sentiment,
dealers said.


They said the gains were kept in check by caution ahead of a US
Federal Reserve policy meeting and worries that China might adopt
more tightening measures following the interest rate hike
announced over the weekend.


The Hang Seng Index was up 90.16 points at 19,356.90, off a high
of 19,463.90 and a low of 19,332.60. Turnover was 39.61 billion
dollars (5.10 billion US).


China Mobile was up 0.65 dollars at 72.80 dollars, extending
gains ahead of its 2006 results announcement Wednesday.
