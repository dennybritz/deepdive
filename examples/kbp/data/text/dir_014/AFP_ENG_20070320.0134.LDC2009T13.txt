Starwood Hotels and Resorts said Tuesday it will build a luxury
hotel in Tibet under its St. Regis brand to take advantage of a
boom in tourist arrivals to the impoverished Chinese-controlled
region.


The company said the 169-room resort would open in January 2010
in the capital Lhasa, a city known more for budget accommodation
aimed at backpackers.


"The St. Regis Lhasa will undoubtedly be heralded as one of the
most extraordinary luxury resorts not only in Asia, but in the
entire world," said Ross Klein, president of Starwood's Luxury
Brand Group.


Tibet is experiencing a boom in tourism due to the completion
last year of a new railway line linking the region with the rest
of China, heightening longstanding worries among exiled Tibetans
about the impact of outside influences on the region's
traditional Buddhist culture.


The resort's facilities will include a presidential suite, 50
villa-style suites, and butler service, the company said.


China's army moved in to "liberate" Tibet in 1951, two years
after the current Communist government in Beijing took control of
the country.


The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, fled in 1959 and has
waged a non- violent campaign for greater rights for the region's
people.


The hotel will be built under a partnership with Lhasa Yungao
International Hotel Company, Starwood said.
