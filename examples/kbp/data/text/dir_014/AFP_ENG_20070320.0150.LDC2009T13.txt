Ten people were killed and 30 houses razed during two days of
clashes between supporters of two political parties in central
Nigerian Benue State, a local newspaper reported Tuesday.


The independent Guardian newspaper said violence erupted on
Sunday and continued until Monday at Kusuv local government area
of the state between supporters of the ruling Peoiple's
Democratic Party (PDP) and the opposition Action Congress (AC).


It said the violence spread to several villages in the council
area until the police were drafted to quell it.


The paper said weapons such as guns, broken bottles and iron rod
were freely used in the fighting, leaving some 10 people dead
while 30 houses were destroyed.


A senior police officer confirmed the clashes, but said details
on casualities were still being compiled.


"We have deployed our men to contain the situation. Everywhere is
now calm," he added.


Tensions are rising in Nigeria ahead of next month's crucial vote
to choose a successor to President Olusegun Obasanjo who steps
down at the end of his two terms of eight years in on May 29.


Last week in southwestern town of Abeokuta, several people were
injured in clashes between two parties over the poll.


Nigeria will hold state governorship elections on April 14, and
presidential and legisalative elections on April 21.
