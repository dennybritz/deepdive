A car bomb exploded in an automobile spare parts market in
Baghdad on Tuesday, killing one person and wounding six, a medic
said, as Iraq marked the fourth anniversary of the US-led
invasion.


The explosion occurred at 7:20 am (0420 GMT) in Mujamma al-Misham
market in south Baghdad, well known for selling tyres, batteries
and other spare parts.


Insurgents have managed to carry out car bombings in Baghdad
despite a massive security crackdown in the capital since
February.


About 90,000 US and Iraqi troops are patrolling the streets of
Baghdad to curb insurgent and sectarian violence.
