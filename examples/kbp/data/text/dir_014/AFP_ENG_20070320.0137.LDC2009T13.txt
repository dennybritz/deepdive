Four car bombings in Baghdad killed at least nine people and
wounded dozens on Tuesday, medics and security officials said, as
Iraq marked the fourth anniversary of the US-led invasion.


Insurgents have managed to carry out dozens of attacks in Baghdad
despite a massive US and Iraqi security crackdown in the capital
since February.


Four people were killed and 21 wounded when a car bomb exploded
in the Sheikh Omar industrial area of central Baghdad, a security
official said.


Another three people were killed and seven wounded when a car
bomb exploded in the Karrada district near the 14th of July
bridge, a security official said.


A third car bomb attack killed one person and wounded six in
Mujamma al-Misham market in south Baghdad, well known for selling
tyres, batteries and other spare parts.


The fourth attack, a suicide car bomb, was against an Iraqi
military checkpoint in Baghdad's western Jamiyah district and
killed one soldier.


About 90,000 US and Iraqi troops are patrolling the streets of
Baghdad to curb insurgent and sectarian violence.
