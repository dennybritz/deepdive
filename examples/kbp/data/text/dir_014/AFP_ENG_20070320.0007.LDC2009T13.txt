a retirement home in southern Russia, the Interfax news agency
reported quoting local officials.


Some 33 more were injured in the fire that broke out in
Kamyshevatskaya village in the Kuban region, officials said,
adding that a total of 97 people were staying at the facility.


Those injured were taken to a regional hospital.


According to emergency situations ministry officials quoted by
the RIA Novosti news agency, the fire was reported at 0111 Moscow
time (2211 GMT Monday), but the firefighting team made it to the
site only an hour later as the nearest fire station was 50

to put out.
