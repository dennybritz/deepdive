Gunmen have kidnapped two Chinese workers in Nigeria, China's
foreign ministry said on Tuesday, the third such incident
involving its citizens in the African nation this year.


The ministry said in a statement that the workers had been
abducted on Saturday in the volatile southeastern Nigerian state
of Anambra.


"The Chinese side is trying to clarify the situation and has
urged the Nigerian side to exert all efforts to rescue them,"
said the brief statement, posted on the ministry's website.


A Nigerian government official had said on Monday that two
"Asians" and a Nigerian were kidnapped over the weekend in
Anambra.


The men were taken together from their factory at Nnewi, the
Nigerian government spokesman told AFP, adding that the motives
for the kidnapping were not yet known.


The Chinese foreign ministry statement appeared to be referring
to the same incident, although this could not be immediately
confirmed.


The oil-rich Niger River Delta region has seen an upsurge in
kidnappings of foreigners over the past year by armed groups
seeking a larger share of the country's oil wealth for delta
residents.


Five Chinese telecoms workers were abducted in early January and
released about two weeks later.


Another nine Chinese oil workers were kidnapped on January 25
before being released after 11 days in captivity.
