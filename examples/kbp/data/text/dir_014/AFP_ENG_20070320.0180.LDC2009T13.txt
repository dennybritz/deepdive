Sixty-five people were killed and seven injured in the west
African state of Guinea after the lorry in which they were
traveling overturned into a lake, medical and police sources said
Tuesday.


The accident occurred late Monday near the town of Gueckedou,
about 700 kilometres (400 miles) southeast of the capital.


"The vehicle overturned into a lake. There were 65 dead," said a
doctor at Gueckedou hospital, who asked not be named.


The truck, carrying 72 people, was heading to a weekly market in
Koudou, 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Gueckedou, near the
border with Sierra Leone.


A police source said the truck was overloaded and speculated that
the accident could have been as a result of "recklessness" on the
part of the driver.


Of the dead, 39 were women, eight of them pregnant, said the
doctor.


The driver and six passengers who were seriously injured were
taken to Gueckedou hospital.


Witnesses said most of the casualties were Guinean traders.


The passengers had borrowed the heavy truck, usually used to
transport passengers and goods, mainly foodstuffs such as rice
and vegetables.


Due to insufficient public transport, trucks are often used to
ferry people in parts of Africa. Bad roads have also contributed
to high rates of fatal accidents.
