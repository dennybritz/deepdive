Chinese football fans have been called to order after hooligans
surrounded and damaged a car carrying the national head coach at
the weekend, state media reported Tuesday.


Zhu Guanghu was leaving a stadium in Xiamen, southeastern China
on Sunday after watching a Chinese Super League match when the
car he was travelling in was blocked by dozens of fans, who
kicked the vehicle and smashed mirrors.


Rowdy fan behaviour, including abuse of officials and players, is
a growing problem at Chinese Super League matches. But the latest
incident shocked top officials.


"They went too far this time," Ma Chengquan, the Chinese Football
Association's official in charge of Super League affairs, told
the China Youth Daily.


"Fans attending matches have to obey league regulations
concerning public order."


The car was driven by match referee Chen Guoqiang, who had been
booed throughout the game which home side Xiamen lost 2-1 to
visiting Tianjin.


The disgruntled Xiamen fans surrounded the car, smashing wing
mirrors and kicking at the bodywork until security personnel
dispersed them several minutes later.


"It looks like it was a small number of hot heads who were upset
at the result," said Xiamen general manager Chen Hui. "It is
intolerable."
