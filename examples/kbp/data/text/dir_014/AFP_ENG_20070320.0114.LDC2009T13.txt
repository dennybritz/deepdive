Singapore will redesign a programme used to reduce obesity among
school children, the education ministry said Tuesday, following
criticisms it exposed overweight kids to ridicule.


The Trim and Fit (TAF) programme, introduced in 1992, requires
children deemed overweight to do extra physical activities,
including running during recess and outside school hours, in a
bid to reach an acceptable weight.


It covers students from primary school to pre-university level.


While the TAF programme has led to a reduction in obesity,
several parents complained that the stigma attached to being
overweight exposed the students to teasing, affecting their self-
confidence.


The acronym "TAF" is a play on the word "FAT".


An education ministry spokesman told AFP the TAF programme would
be replaced by the "Holistic Health Framework."


"Its broad scope extends beyond physical health to include social
and mental health. The focus is on the total well-being of all
students and on educating them to take responsibility for their
health," the spokesman said.


Schools would have the flexibility to choose from a range of
activities that catered to their students' needs, he added.


Apart from health and physical education, the new scheme would
include the teaching of life skills and would have greater
involvement from health officials as well as parents, he said.


The spokesman said the education ministry would be introducing
the new scheme from this year, and all schools were expected to
implement it by 2010.
