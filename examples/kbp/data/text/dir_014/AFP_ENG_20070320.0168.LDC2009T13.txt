Chinese teenager Ding Junhui has been drawn to meet two-time
world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in the first round of
this year's World Championship.


The 31-year-old O'Sullivan, the world champion in 2001 and 2004,
won 10-3 when he met the 19-year-old Chinese star in January's
Masters final at Wembley.


In other matches, defending champion Graeme Dott takes on Ian
McCulloch while 2005 champion Shaun Murphy tackles Judd Trump -
who joins former champions Stephen Hendry and O'Sullivan in
making his debut at the age of 17.


Veterans Steve Davis and John Parrott are set to meet on the
Crucible baize for the first time in 16 years, while seven-time
champion Hendry faces Derby's world number 66 David Gilbert.


The event takes place at the Sheffield venue from April 21 to May
7.
