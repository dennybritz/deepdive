Another Bombardier passenger plane operated by a Japanese airline
suffered landing gear problems Tuesday, officials said, a week
after a plane of the same model made a dramatic belly-landing.


The landing gear of a Bombardier DHC-8, run by regional carrier
Amakusa Airlines, failed to lower properly but the plane landed
safely after the crew released all three wheels manually, a
transport ministry official said.


A runway at Kumamoto Airport, about 900 kilometres (558 miles)
west of Tokyo, was temporarily closed after the plane -- which
was carrying 15 passengers and three crew -- reported the
mechanical problems.


Last week a Bombardier DHC-8 operated by All Nippon Airways (ANA)
failed to lower its front wheel and skidded down the runway on
its nose upon landing at Kochi Airport in southwestern Japan.


Japanese aviation authorities have ordered their airlines to
inspect all Bombardier DHC-8 aircraft. Amakusa Airlines said it
had found no trouble with the landing gear of the twin-turboprop
during the inspection.


The Canadian airplane maker apologised last week for the wheel
trouble, while ANA indefinitely suspended flights using its 13
DHC-8 planes.


There have been numerous previous cases involving the same type
of aircraft when the front wheels needed to be lowered manually
due to technical problems.
