The United Nations is to repatriate the remains of two Filipinos
who died in a plane crash in Angola at the height of civil unrest
in 1998, the foreign department said Tuesday.


Forensics experts in South Africa have identified the two "from
the remains gathered from the crash site based on DNA samples
provided by their next of kin," the department said in a
statement.


They are Ramon Dumlao and Bernabe Vicarme, both crew members of a
C-130 aircraft hired by the UN's World Food Programme to deliver
food supplies to some 100,000 refugees displaced by internal
strife.


The airplane, which was carrying 14 crewmen and passengers, may
have been shot down by Angolan rebels using a surface-to-air
missile, causing the crash on December 26, 1998. The remains of a
third Filipino have yet to be identified, the department said.


Christen Halle, project manager of the UN's Angolan Recovery
Project, is to formally turn over the remains of the two
Filipinos to their families in Manila next week, the department
said.
