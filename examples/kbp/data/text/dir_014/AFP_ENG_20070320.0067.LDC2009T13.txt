China said Tuesday that North Korea was ready to shut down its
Yongbyon nuclear facility and accept UN inspectors as part of the
six-nation disarmament process.


"We found that the DPRK is ready to shut down and seal the
facility in Yongbyon and accept the monitoring and supervision of
the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)," foreign ministry
spokesman Liu Jianchao said.


Liu did not give a specific timeframe but a six-nation accord
signed last month commits North Korea to closing Yongbyon and
allowing IAEA inspectors in by mid- April.
