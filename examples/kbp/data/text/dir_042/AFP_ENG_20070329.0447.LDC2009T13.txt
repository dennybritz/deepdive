The French Grand Prix is in danger of being scrapped from next
year's Formula One calendar unless fans turn up to support this
year's edition at Magny-Cours.


That was Thursday's stark message issued by organisers of a race
that has been held at the unfashionable circuit in the Nievre
region of central France since 1991.


Race organiser Jacques Regis said: "There won't be a France Grand
Prix in 2008 if the public don't turn up at the 2007 race."


The FFSA, French motor racing's ruling body, has gone to
strenuous efforts to attract people to the event, with former
Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters appearing at a concert at last
year's meeting.


In 2004 the FFSA stepped in to manage the financially-struggling
race which has traditionally had difficulty drawing in the crowds
due to its geographical position.
