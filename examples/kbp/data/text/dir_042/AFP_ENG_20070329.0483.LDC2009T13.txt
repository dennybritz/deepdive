Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said Thursday he hoped 15 British
navy personnel held by Iran will be released, voicing concern
their detention will further inflame the situation in the Gulf.


"This is of course a very unfortunate incident, and we're afraid
that it's going to already add to the tense situation that exists
in the Gulf," Prince Saud al- Faisal told reporters in Riyadh.


"We would like to see this resolved through diplomatic channels
as quickly as possible. Some of us who have relations with Iran
are in contact with Iran," Saud said.


"We hope they are released, we don't need any added inflammatory
incidents in the Gulf and we feel for the families of those
soldiers," he added.


The 15 Britons were captured on Friday in the northern Gulf in
what Iran insists were its territorial waters but Britain says
they were picked up while on a routine patrol in Iraqi waters.


The crisis comes against the backdrop of Iran's standoff with the
West over its nuclear programme.


Saud was speaking at the end of an Arab summit in Riyadh.


UN chief Ban Ki-moon discussed the detention of the 15 British
naval personnel with Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki
in Riyadh earlier Thursday. Both men were in the Saudi capital to
attend the opening and closing sessions of the Arab summit.
