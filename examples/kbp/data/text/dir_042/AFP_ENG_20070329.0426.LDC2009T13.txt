The 2007 Franz Kafka literary prize will go to French poet,
essayist and translator Yves Bonnefoy, organisers of the award
said on Thursday.


Bonnefoy will receive the prize along with a cheque for 10,000
dollars (7,500 euros) at a ceremony at the Prague city hall at
the end of October.


The French poet "will in his thank you speech express his deep
admiration for Franz Kafka's work, as well as his belief in the
future of poetry," the Franz Kafka Society, which organises the
award, said in a statement.


Bonnefoy, 83, is the author of such books as "On the motion and
immobility of Douve" from 1953, "Words in Stone" from 1965 and
"The Curved Planks" from 2001, and claims to be inspired by the
works of French writers Andre Breton and Gaston Bachelard.


The Kafka prize, named after the famous writer of such legendary
books as "The Trial", "Metamorphosis" and "The Castle", was first
awarded in 2001.


Previous winners of the prize include Japanese author Haruki
Murakami, British playwright Harold Pinter, US novelist Philip
Roth and the Czech writer Ivan Klima.


The award aims to recognise "exceptional literary creation of
contemporary authors whose work addresses the readers regardless
of their origin, nationality and culture," the Franz Kafka
Society said on its website.
