England coach Steve McClaren has "the worst job in football",
according to Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock.


McClaren has been subjected to a torrent of criticism and abuse
from English fans and media in the last week as his side
struggled during Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel and Andorra.


He was jeered by supporters throughout England's unconvincing 3-0
win over part- timers Andorra on Wednesday and there were calls
for the former Middlesbrough manager to be sacked before and
after the match in Barcelona.


Warnock believes that kind of scrutiny makes the England coach's
job an unpalatable prospect for all but the most thick-skinned
managers.


"It's a sad situation when you see the kind of criticism that
Steve is getting at the moment," Warnock said.


"I know that it is par for the course but it's one of the reasons
I would never, ever recommend the England job to anyone. Why
anyone would ever dream of wanting it I don't know.


"I think it's the worst job in football, unless you go in
thinking 'to hell with it'.


"All managers appreciate what others go through. Steve's not
daft, he knows they are not playing well and the fans aren't
happy, and it's a lonely place when things are like that.


"You don't like abuse and I felt a little bit sick last night
listening to the fans. It's not nice for any manager - and Steve
got four points out of the two games.


"Watching some of the contortions on the faces of the fans is
quite frightening and shows the nasty side of the game of
football."
