More than 30 percent of Japanese school buildings are not
resistant to big earthquakes, officials said Thursday, just days
after a huge earth tremor shook the country.


Of the 130,867 buildings at public schools across Japan, one of
the world's most earthquake-prone countries, 39,531 or 30.2
percent were not capable of resisting big quakes, the education
ministry said in a statement.


Another 17,001 buildings have not been checked despite central
government orders for municipal authorities to do so, and only
56.8 percent have been confirmed as quake-resistant, it said.


"We will continue our efforts in improving quake-resistance of
school buildings, including calling for early implementation of
seismic assessment," the statement said.


A powerful earthquake hit Japan's main island Sunday, killing one
and injuring more than 200 people.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes.


A 7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe in January
1995 killed 6,437 people, while 67 people were killed in 2004 in
a 6.8-magnitude quake in the central Niigata region.
