The US Senate on Thursday approved a  bill tying funding for the
war in Iraq to a calendar for the withdrawal of US troops,
setting the stage for a major confrontation with President George
W. Bush.


The measure seeking to force a dramatic change in US Iraq policy,
was approved by a party line vote of 51 to 47.


The bill's passage sets up a showdown with the US president, who
again on Thursday admantly rejected any time restrictions on the
presence of US troops.


"I'll veto a bill that restricts our commanders on the ground in
Iraq, a bill that doesn't fund our troops, a bill that's got too
much spending on it," Bush said after meeting with Republican
congressional allies.


"When we've got a troop in harm's way, we expect that troop to be
fully funded. When we've got commanders making tough decisions on
the ground, we expect there to be no strings on our commanders,"
the president said.
