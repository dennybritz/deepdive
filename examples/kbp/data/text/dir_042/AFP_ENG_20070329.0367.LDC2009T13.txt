Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I'm feeling bad because we lost the game, but I'm happy that I
took a hat- trick. The old ball was reverse-swinging and I got
the wickets. I tried to get five-in-a-row, but unfortunately
couldn't."


- Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga after becoming the first
player to take four wickets in four balls in an international
match.


"We are sunk. No one wants to advertise any more. Is there a
World Cup going on? Where? My figures don't show that."


- Delhi-based advertising executive Rajmohan Singh coming to
terms with the financial fallout of India and Pakistan suffering
early exits from the World Cup.


"I've had a lot of commitment and passion, to get back into the
one-day side. To represent Australia at the World Cup is an
enormous privilege and honour."


- Matthew Hayden, with two successive centuries under his belt,
on fighting his way back into the Australia team.


"You hear about other sides saying they don't fear us, don't fear
anything we have to offer. It's all right saying that, but you
have to go out there and play a certain brand of cricket to back
that up. So far they haven't done that."


- Ricky Ponting putting Australia's critics in their place.


"It was very disappointing. You sit back and you think at least
every single game the West Indies play is going to be a full
house. I don't know what to put my finger on as the problem but
again we've just got to focus on the cricket and hopefully the
people will come out."


- West Indies skipper Brian Lara on the low crowds for the World
Cup.
