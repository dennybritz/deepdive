A top Iranian official said on Thursday that Tehran will not
release a female British sailor detained with 14 male colleagues
as previously promised because of London's "incorrect attitude."


The announcment by the head of Iran's supreme national security
council Ali Larijani came a day after London announced it was
freezing ties with Tehran over the crisis.


"It was announced that a woman in the group would be freed, but
(this development) was met with an incorrect attitude. Naturally,
(the release) will be suspended and it will not take place," he
said on state television.


Iran had said on Wednesday that Faye Turney, the only woman among
the 15 sailors captured in Gulf waters on Friday, would be
released within a day or two.


In London, the Foreign Office gave no immediate reaction to the
news, with a spokesman simply reiterating: "We continue to press
for their release."


Larijani, who is Iran's chief nucler negotiator, also threatened
to pursue a "legal path" in the case, which has caused jitters
around the world and sent oil prices to six month highs.


"Instead of sending a technical team to examine the problem, they
kicked up a media storm, announced a freeze in relations and
spoke about the Security Council. That will not resolve the
problem. They have miscalcuated," Larijani said.
