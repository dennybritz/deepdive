EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on Thursday hailed the "new
consensus" among Arab states for a Middle East peace process,
hoping it will lead to new talks with Israel and the
Palestinians.


A day after attending an Arab League summit in Riyadh, Solana
highlighted the key role of Saudi King Abdullah in reviving
efforts to unblock the situation.


"He is trying to play a leadership role to resolve this problem.
So it is a revitalisation for the Arab league that is very
important," he told the European Parliament in Brussels.


The EU is seeking a "completely new dynamic" in the Middle East
peace process via a series of meetings leading, hopefully, to
Israeli and Palestinian involvement, Solana told reporters
earlier on the airplane back from Riyadh.


He voiced his support for the recently renewed Arab peace
initiative, and will carry that message on to a meeting of EU
foreign ministers in Bremen, northern Germany, which starts
Friday.


"My message to the (EU) foreign ministers will be that the Arab
initiative is firmly back on the table and we must support it,"
Solana said. "I see a new consensus in the Arab League which we
have not seen for some time".


The revived Arab blueprint offers Israel full normalisation of
relations if it withdraws from all lands it occupied in 1967,
permits the creation of a Palestinian state and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
