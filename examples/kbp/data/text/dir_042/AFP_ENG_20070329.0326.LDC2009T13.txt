Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that he
was waiting for a response from Tehran on whether Turkish
diplomats could see the 15 British military personnel held in
Iran.


Erdogan made the request to Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr
Mottaki at the Arab League summit in Riyadh on Wednesday.


British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett had told Turkish
leaders in Ankara a day earlier that London would welcome efforts
by diplomats from third countries to visit the soldiers.


"I asked Mr. Mottaki whether he can help our ambassador in Tehran
to see the captives," the Anatolia news agency quoted Erdogan as
telling reporters.


Mottaki initially declined, citing the ongoing investigation, but
when Erdogan insisted, he replied that he would see whether it
could be possible, Erdogan said.


"We are awaiting a response from Iran," he added.


Turkey has pledged to help its NATO ally Britain in the standoff
over the 15 sailors and marines accused of illegally entering
Iranian waters.


Erdogan said Wednesday he had also pressed Mottaki for the
release of the sole woman among the captives.


Tehran said Wednesday that the female sailor would be released
"within a day or two," but backed off on Thursday, citing
Britain's "incorrect" attitude after London announced the
suspension of all ties with the Islamic republic until the crisis
is resolved.


Britain says the eight sailors and seven marines were on a
"routine" anti- smuggling operation in Iraqi waters when they
were seized at gunpoint in the north of the Gulf on Friday.
