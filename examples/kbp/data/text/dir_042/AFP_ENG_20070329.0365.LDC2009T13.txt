A Sri Lankan naval patrol has sunk at least three suspected Tamil
Tiger boats off the island's northeastern coast, killing  more
than 20 rebels, the defence ministry said on Thursday.


The four-hour battle erupted off the seas of Alampil late on
Wednesday and involved a flotilla of 20 rebel boats, the ministry
said, adding that one of its sailors had suffered injuries.


"Intercepted Tiger communications revealed that over 20 Sea
Tigers had been killed, including a senior Sea Tiger leader," the
ministry said, quoting the navy.


The ministry said three of the Tiger boats were destroyed while a
fourth was damaged.


Earlier, the ministry had estimated Tiger dead at 12 to 15 with
one sailor wounded during the lengthy exchange of fire in the
high seas.


There was no immediate reaction from the Tigers.


The attack came a day after the military said it captured a key
rebel base in the east of the island without a fight. The rebels
had withdrawn from the Kokkadichcholai base by the time the
troops moved in, the military said.
