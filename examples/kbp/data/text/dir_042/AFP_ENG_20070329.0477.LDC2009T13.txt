Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo Thursday formally appointed
rebel leader Guillaume Soro as his prime minister as part of a
peace accord between the former arch-rivals, his spokesman said.


Desire Tagro said the decree was signed during a meeting between
the two men in Abidjan, following the accord reached in the
Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou on March 4.


Soro will replace Charles Konan Banny, who was approved as prime
minister by the United Nations Security Council in 2005 but
struggled to carry out his task of pursuing the peace process in
the divided West African country and move toward new elections.
