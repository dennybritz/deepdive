Charlton midfielder Andy Reid has been ruled out for the rest of
the season after surgery on a hamstring injury.


Reid, 24, has not played since January because of the problem and
will miss the last eight games of the season as he recovers from
a minor operation.


The Republic of Ireland star has played just 17 times since his
three million pounds (six million dollars) transfer from
Tottenham in August, but his absence is a blow to Charlton
manager Alan Pardew as he tries to lead his relegation-
threatened side to Premiership survivial.
