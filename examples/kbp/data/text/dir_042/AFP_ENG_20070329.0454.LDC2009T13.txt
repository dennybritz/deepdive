British Prime Minister Tony Blair's father-in-law is to appear in
a top television soap opera as a "down-and-out," producers said.


Tony Booth, the 75-year-old actor father of Blair's wife Cherie,
is expected to appear in "Emmerdale", one of Britain's most
popular soap operas.


Booth will play "mysterious down-and-out Errol" in up to seven
episodes of the series, which is set in a rural northern English
village.


"We are thrilled to welcome such a popular and respected actor
such as Tony to the show," said Emmerdale producer Kathleen
Beedles.


"He is the perfect choice for this storyline, which is sure to
charm and captivate viewers both young and old."


Booth said: "I hope that viewers will warm to my character as
much as I have, and be enchanted by his somewhat ethereal
quality."


Booth, a father of eight, all daughters, shot to fame in "Till
Death Us Do Part", a 1960s sitcom who's main character, Alf
Garnett, was a rabid bigot. Booth played his son-in-law.


In 2003 he played a tramp on BBC television's flagship soap
"EastEnders".
