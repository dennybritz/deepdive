A British motion calling on Iran to immediately free 15 detained
British naval personnel will be discussed by the UN Security
Council on Thursday, the Council chairman said.


The draft statement on the crisis was distributed to other
members of the Security Council on Wednesday night


Dumisani Kumalo, the South African envoy who is the Security
Council chairman for March, said it would be discussed on
Thursday.


The draft statement condemns the continued detention of the eight
sailors and seven marines and emphasises that they were operating
in Iraqi territorial waters under a UN Security Council
resolution when seized.


The South African envoy said the call for the release of the
naval personnel had widespread support, but added it needed the
unanimous backing of the 15 Council members to be approved.
