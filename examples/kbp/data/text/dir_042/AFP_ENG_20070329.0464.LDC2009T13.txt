GPS coordinates of two British boats seized with 15 sailors were
changed by Iran to make it appear they were in Iranian waters
while in fact they were inside Iraqi territory, Britain's UN
envoy charged Thursday.


"It was only when we point out that the detention (of the 15
British sailors and marines) was inapproriate and in our view
unlawful that the coordinates were then changed by the Iranian
government to be coordinates within Iranian waters," British
Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry said.
