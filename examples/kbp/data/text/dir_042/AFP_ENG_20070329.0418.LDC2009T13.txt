London Underground has reprimanded a young daredevil who skied
down the transport system's longest escalator and posted his feat
on the YouTube, reports said Thursday.


In the clip a station attendant can be heard shouting, just
before a young Norwegian called Arild hurtles down the 90-metre
(300-foot) escalator at breakneck speed with a camera attached to
his head.


He safely completes the descent to the applause of other
passengers at the Angel tube station, according to the 70-second
video, which has been watched nearly 300,000 times.


The stunt is an example of "free skiing" -- a cross between
skiing, snowboarding and skateboarding -- a craze that is popular
in Norway.


However, the extreme skiier's antics did not impress London
Underground, who told the Guardian newspaper that the act was
"dangerous, stupid and irresponsible".
