The publisher of the seventh and last Harry Potter book has
unveiled the cover of the new book, which features the boy wizard
with a hand stretched up into an orange sky.


"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the much-anticipated
final installment of the hugely-successful series by British
writer J.K. Rowling, is due to go on sale at midnight on July 21.


The cover art of the new book is by illustrator Mary GrandPre,
who painted the covers for the previous six books in the series.


"The front cover of 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'
features a dramatic sky of oranges and golds. It depicts 17-year-
old Harry with arm outstretched, reaching upward," publisher
Scholastic said in a statement.


"The structures around Harry show evident destruction and in the
shadows behind him, we see outlines of other people," said the
cover designer, Scholastic Creative Director David Saylor.


"For the first time the cover is a wrap-around. On the back cover
spidery hands are outstretched towards Harry.


"Only when the book is opened does one see a powerful image of
He-Who-Must-Not- Be-Named, his glowing red eyes peering out from
his hood," he said.


The first six books in the Potter series have sold more than 300
million copies worldwide and been translated into 63 languages,
making Rowling, 41, Britain's highest-earning woman.
