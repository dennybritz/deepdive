Seven Ethiopian soldiers were killed in heavy fighting on
Thursday in the south of Mogadishu, and two of their bodies were
dragged through the streets, an AFP correspondent witnessed.


Local residents pulled the bodies of two soldiers in the street
while five other bodies in Ethiopian uniforms were lying on the
ground in the southern district of Shirkole.


Loudspeakers had earlier transmitted calls for residents to come
out and fight the Ethiopian troops backing Somalia's transitional
government.


The latest deaths brought the toll in Thursday's fighting to 22.
