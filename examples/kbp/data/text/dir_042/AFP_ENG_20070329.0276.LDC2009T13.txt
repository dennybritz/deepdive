London is not seeking a confrontation with Iran over its capture
of British sailors, Prime Minister Tony Blair's official
spokesman said Thursday.


Speaking shortly before an Iranian official announced that the
sole female sailor would not after all be freed because of
London's "incorrect" attitude, the spokesman said Britain was not
seeking to back Tehran into a corner.


And he dismissed reported suggestions from Iranian Foreign
Minister Manouchehr Mottaki that Britain could resolve the crisis
by admitting it made a "mistake," saying: "The facts are the
facts."


"What is important is that Iran knows that it is isolated on this
issues," the spokesman said. "We want this resolved. We don't
want a confrontation over this. We want this resolved as quickly
as possible," he said.


"We are not seeking to put Iran in a corner. We are simply
saying, 'Please release the personnel who should not have been
seized in the first place'."


London on Wednesday unveiled a dossier of evidence which it said
proves the 15 Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel were in
Iraqi, not Iranian waters when they were seized.
