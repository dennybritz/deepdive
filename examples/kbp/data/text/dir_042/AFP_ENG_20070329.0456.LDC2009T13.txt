West Indies were 114-4 after 30 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against New Zealand at the Sir Vivian Richards
Stadium here Thursday.


Skipper Brian Lara was on 18 with Dwayne Bravo on 16.


Shivnarine Chanderpaul was the first man out caught by Scott
Styris in the slips off Shane Bond for four in the eighth over
with the score on 14.


Ramnaresh Sarwan then fell for 19 brilliantly caught by wicket-
keeper Brendon McCullum off Jacob Oram in the 17th over with the
score on 66.


Marlon Samuels was the third man out again caught behind off Oram
for 9 while Chris Gayle had reached 44, his best score of the
tournament, when he was clean- bowled by Oram after finding an
inside edge in the 23rd over.


New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and elected to
field.


West Indies were playing for the third straight day after their
opening Super Eights match, a 103-run defeat by world champions
Australia, spanned Tuesday and Wednesday because of rain.


They made one change from that match, with Lendl Simmons in for
fast bowler Jerome Taylor whose 10 wicketless overs against
Australia cost 67 runs.


This was New Zealand's first Super Eights match.


The Black Caps were without batsman Lou Vincent who was forced
out of the World Cup on Sunday after having his wrist broken
batting in the nets against Kiwi fast bowler Shane Bond.


Peter Fulton moved up to open in his place alongside Fleming with
Hamish Marshall drafted into the top order barely two days after
arriving in Antigua.


Group C winners New Zealand carried forward two points into the
second round after beating fellow qualifiers England.
