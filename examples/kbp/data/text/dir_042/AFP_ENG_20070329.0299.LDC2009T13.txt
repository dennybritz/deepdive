Arsenal chiefs insist reports of a takeover by American sports
tycoon Stan Kroenke are premature.


It had been suggested that Kroenke, whose Sports Enterprises
company owns the Colorado Rapids football team, the Denver
Nuggets basketball team and the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey
squad, was in talks to buy the north London side.


Manchester United, Liverpool and Aston Villa are all under
American ownership, fuelling speculation that the Gunners would
be next in line for a takeover by a US investor. Kroenke already
has links with Arsenal after signing a marketing partnership with
the club last month.


But, while Arsenal managing director Keith Edelman confirmed that
television company Granada/ITV are keen to cash-in their
9.9percent stake in the club, he is adamant the board have no
plans to sell up at present.


"As everyone knows the Granada/ ITV stake has been for sale for
the last 12 months," Edelman said. "They have announced that
owning football clubs was not part of their strategy.


"That started a lot of media speculation but, as a board, we want
to step back from that. The directors are committed to the club
and love the club. That is all we want to say on the matter at
the moment."
