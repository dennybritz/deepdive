Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko threatened on Thursday to
dissolve parliament and hold early elections after months of
tensions between pro-Western and pro-Russian political forces.


Either "we cool hot heads" or "we take a political decision and
organise early elections," Yushchenko said at a press conference
in the city of Lugansk in eastern Ukraine that was broadcast live
on television.


Yushchenko, a pro-Western politician, accused the pro-Russian
coalition in parliament, established after parliamentary
elections last year, of attempting to "usurp power" by trying to
persuade pro-Western lawmakers to switch sides.


The crisis has paralysed political activity in this former Soviet
republic.


Yushchenko, who served as chairman of Ukraine's central bank
before becoming an opposition leader, was brought to power in a
series of protests in 2004 against the government's pro-Russian
candidate, Viktor Yanukovych.


Yanukovych became prime minister last year after his party won
the most votes in elections and the pro-Western parties that
backed the 2004 "orange revolution" failed to come to an
agreement.
