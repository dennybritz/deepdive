Nepal is likely to unveil a new government line-up on Friday
after weeks of wrangling over which cabinet posts should go to
former Maoist rebels, the deputy prime minister said Thursday.


"Agreements have been reached on almost all issues, including the
distribution of ministerial portfolios, among the eight party
leaders," Amik Sherchan, deputy prime minister told AFP.


"Therefore the formation of the interim government is likely on
Friday," he said.


The former rebels were granted seats in an interim parliament in
January, but ongoing discussions over sharing ministerial
positions between the seven main political parties plus the
Maoists has delayed the formation of a new interim government.


At least 13,000 people were killed in the Maoist's decade-long
Maoist "people's war" that ended with the signing of a peace deal
in November 2006.


The new cabinet will have the task of overseeing crucial
elections scheduled for June, when the country will vote on
members of a constitutional assembly.


This assembly will then permanently rewrite the impoverished
Himalayan nation's constitution and decide on the fate of
embattled King Gyanendra and the monarchy as a whole.


The Maoists are lobbying hard for the country to be declared a
republic.
