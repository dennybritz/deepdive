Bomb attacks and gunfire killed at least 13 people in and around
Baghdad on Thursday as violence continued in the war-torn
country, security officials said.


In the biggest attack, five people died and nearly 20 were
wounded when a car bomb exploded in the town of Mahmudiyah, 30
kilometres (20 miles) south of Baghdad, police said.


In the capital, two policemen died and another six were wounded
when a car rigged with explosives and stuffed with a corpse blew
up when they came to retrieve the body, a security official said.


Iraqi policemen, who are a daily target for Sunni insurgents
opposed to the Shiite-led government, found the car parked in the
downtown Al-Amel district.


Another two policemen were killed and two wounded when gunmen
opened fire on the traffic police chief's convoy as it passed
through a district of northern Baghdad near the Sunni al-Nida
mosque, an official said.


Three more Iraqis were killed and another 20 wounded in a
roadside bomb explosion in southwestern Baghdad's Baya district.


In the country's third city of Mosul, gunmen shot dead a civilian
driving through the Sumar district, said police Colonel Ali
Khalil.


Iraqi and US troops last month launched a massive crackdown in
and around Baghdad, deploying 80,000 soldiers in the streets in a
bid to wrest control of the capital from insurgents and sectarian
killings.


More than 150 people have been killed in the past three days,
most of them in sectarian bloodshed in the northern town of Tal
Afar.
