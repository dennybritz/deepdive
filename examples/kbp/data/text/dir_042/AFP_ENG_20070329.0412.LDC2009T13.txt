US President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-
Hyun on Thursday discussed bilateral trade talks and the
implementation of a nuclear deal with North Korea, the White
House said.


"The two leaders discussed the ongoing Free Trade Agreement
negotiations. They also discussed next steps in implemention of
six party talks and the February 13 agreement," said national
security spokesman Gordon Johndroe.


The talks group the United States, China, Russia, Japan, South
Korea and the North, which tested its first nuclear weapon last
October.


In a February 13 agreement the North agreed to shut down and seal
its plutonium- producing Yongbyon reactor and other plants by
April 14 in exchange for economic aid and diplomatic benefits.
