Wigan manager Paul Jewell on Thursday denied an English Football
Association charge of improper conduct and/or bringing the game
into disrepute.


Jewell has requested a personal hearing to defend himself after
being charged for his comments about referee Phil Dowd following
Wigan's 2-1 defeat at Arsenal on February 11.


Dowd denied Wigan a second half penalty and moments later Arsenal
scored a goal that television replays showed should have been
ruled offside, prompting Jewell to claim the official's decisions
would cost his club 50 million pounds (98 million dollars) if
they were relegated.


Speaking after the Emirates Stadium clash he had said: "Some of
the officials don't understand the game. He (Dowd) has cost our
team the points. It could cost us 50 million pounds."


A statement on the FA's website said: "Wigan Athletic manager
Paul Jewell has denied a charge of improper conduct and/or
bringing the game into disrepute.


"The charge relates to media comments made about referee Phil
Dowd following Wigan's game against Arsenal on 11 February."
