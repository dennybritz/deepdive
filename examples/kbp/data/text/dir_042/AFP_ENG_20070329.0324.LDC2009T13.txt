Russia must take steps to halt a seemingly systematic series of
murders of journalists and to ensure those responsible are
brought to justice, a UN expert on extrajudicial executions said
on Thursday.


"The government of Russia must bring to an end what appears to be
a consistent pattern of failing to prosecute those responsible,"
UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston said in a statement.


"Murders are always tragic, but when journalists are being
murdered to cover up human rights abuses, the stakes for the
society are even higher than usual," Alston said.


The murder last October of prominent investigative reporter Anna
Politkovskaya, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin and
the war in Chechnya, prompted international outrage.


The UN expert investigated the killings of some 13 journalists in
Russia since 2000, and found that almost all of them appear to
have been targeted because of their reports on corruption or
human rights abuses in the Chechen conflict.


A majority of the victims were shot at point-blank range by
unidentified gunmen in contract-style murders, he added.


He said the Russian government had provided a "cooperative but
incomplete response" to his request for detailed information on
the results of any investigations and prosecutions undertaken.


Alston also called on the international community to remain
vigilant over the situation of journalists in Russia.


"It is of critical importance to a whole range of human rights
that journalists can do their work without risking violent
death," he said.
