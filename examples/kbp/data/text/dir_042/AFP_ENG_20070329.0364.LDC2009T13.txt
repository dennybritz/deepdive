Wall Street shares raced higher at the opening Thursday as an
upward revision to US economic growth helped ease fears about a
slowdown and prompted bargain hunting after a big selloff.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 72.50 points (0.59
percent) to 12,372.86 in the first exchanges, recouping most of
the prior day's losses.


The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite climbed 15.05 points (0.62
percent) to 2,432.15 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500
increased 7.43 points (0.52 percent) to 1,424.66.


Ahead of the bell, the US government released data showing the US
economy grew at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter, a bit
faster than earlier estimates.


This helped spark a rebound from Wednesday's selloff, when
markets were jittery about Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke's
remains about "uncertainties" in the US housing market and
uncomfortably high inflation.


"Today's upward revision of the 4th quarter GDP should ease some
concerns regarding shape of current economic conditions and the
earnings outlook for the first quarter which ends tomorrow," said
Fred Dickson at DA Davidson.


"Market concerns over the situation in Iran appear to be built
into the market at the current price level."
