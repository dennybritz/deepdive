The French unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 8.4
percent of the working population in February, official data
showed on Thursday signalling the lowest figure since June 1983.


A government source said that this unemployment rate was
calculated according to norms established by the International
Labour Organisation.


The source said that under a different calculation used by the
French labour ministry, the rate also fell by 0.1 percentage
points to the same level of 8.4 percent.


The government source said the number of registered people
looking for work had fallen by 1.0 percent to 2,066,100 people.


The figures were published in the midst of a campaign for the
first round of a presidential election on April 22, in which
unemployment is a central isue. France has suffered from high
unemployment for years, but in the last year or so the rate has
shown a steady, although erratic, decline.
