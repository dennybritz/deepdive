Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's centrist Kadima party would
be crushed if new elections were held today, one year after it
came to power, according to a poll released on Thursday.


Kadima would receive 11 mandates in the 120-seat Knesset,
compared with the 29 it has now, said the survey broadcast on
public radio.


The main right-wing Likud opposition party, led by former premier
Benjamin Netanyahu, would surge to 31 seats, compared with the 12
it has now.


The Labour party, Kadima's main coalition partner led by the
increasingly unpopular Defence Minister Amir Peretz, would get 17
seats, compared with the 19 now.


Ultra-Orthodox Shas would drop by one seat to 11, while the
ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu would remain unchanged with 11.


The poll questioned 500 people and has a 4.5 percent margin of
error.


Kadima made history last year when it became the first party to
win the first parliamentary poll it contested. It was formed in
late 2005 by then prime minister Ariel Sharon.


The ratings of Olmert and Kadima have been steadily sliding
following last year's inconclusive war on Hezbollah and amid a
string of scandals involving the premier and senior members of
his government.
