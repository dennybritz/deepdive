Italy's Senate is set to vote Friday on a raft of deregulation
measures, the minister for parliamentary relations, Vannino
Chiti, announced Thursday.


The upper house will vote Friday on several dozen changes aimed
at making life easier -- and cheaper -- for the consumer, such as
eliminating cell phone charges, allowing bakers to sell
newspapers and increasing sales outlets for petrol, notably at
supermarkets.


Service station managers staged a strike in February over the
deregulation of petrol sales.


A vote on the measures in the lower Chamber of Deputies passed
easily last week.


Consumer associations calculate that the changes will save the
average family some 550 euros (730 dollars) a year.


A first wave of deregulatory measures last June allowed greater
competition in the sale of medicines as well as in banking
services and among taxi drivers.
