The UN atomic agency has told Iran to allow its inspectors to
install surveillance cameras at an underground nuclear site by
the end of the week, diplomats told AFP Thursday.


The International Atomic Energy Agency's chief of safeguards
Ollie Heinonen sent a letter earlier this month saying the IAEA
wanted the cameras installed by the end of March at a uranium
enrichment plant being built in Natanz, in central Iran, one
diplomat said.


The diplomat said there was still room for negotiation but that
if Iran did not comply, IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei would have
to notify the agency's 35-nation board that Tehran was not
meeting its nuclear safeguards obligations.


The diplomat said such notification could come in mid-April.


This could lead to an emergency board meeting, something sought
by the United States and other Western nations, and eventually to
the matter being brought before the UN Security Council.


The Council has already imposed sanctions on Iran over its
nuclear programme, which Washington insists is aimed at
developing nuclear weapons.


Several diplomats, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the information, stressing that the IAEA did not have
the authority to give Iran orders but that it was trying to set a
time frame for cooperation.
