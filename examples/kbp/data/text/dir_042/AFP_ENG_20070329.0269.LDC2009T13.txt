Authorities in central China have slain a giant dragon after
determining the partially built tourist attraction had gone ahead
without official approval, state media reported.


The 21-kilometre-long (13-mile) serpent, billed as the world's
largest dragon by its financial backers, was being built outside
the Henan provincial capital of Zhengzhou at a cost of 300
million dollars, but Xinhua news agency reported that
construction has been halted.


Local officials had decided to investigate after nationwide media
reports revealed the project was being built along mountain
ridges in a national forest park, Xinhua said.


The dragon's completed head rises nine metres (30 feet) above the
ground and about 800 metres of its metal-encased body had already
been finished.


Zulong, the Henan development company behind the structure, has
said it would sell advertising space on the beast, which also
will house galleries in which visitors can pay to have their
names and other messages inscribed.


Zulong President Li Shumin told Xinhua he was considering filing
a lawsuit over the halting of the project.
