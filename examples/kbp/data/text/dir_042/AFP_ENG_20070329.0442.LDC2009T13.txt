Iberdrola, Spain's second-biggest electricity provider, said
Thursday its shareholders had as expected backed its 17.1
-billion-euro (22.8-billion-dollar) takeover of British group
Scottish Power.


Iberdrola said in a statement that the operation would be
submitted for approval by Scottish Power shareholders on Friday
at the company's extraordinary general shareholders' meeting in
Glasgow.


Iberdrola chairman Ignacio Galan told shareholders at their
annual general assembly in Madrid the merger would "create one of
the largest companies in the global energy sector with a total
enterprise value of around 65 billion euros."


Scottish Power is the fifth-biggest gas provider in Britain with
nine percent of the market, and the sixth-biggest electricity
provider with 13 percent.


A tie-up with Iberdrola, amid consolidation in the European
energy sector, would create Europe's third-biggest utility group
and would see Spain finally creating a so-called utility
champion.


Iberdrola hopes to complete the operation in April.
