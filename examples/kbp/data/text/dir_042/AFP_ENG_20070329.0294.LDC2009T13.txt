ProSiebenSAT1, the German commercial television group, said
Thursday it would examine a possible takeover of rival group SBS
Broadcasting, which belongs to ProSieben's new owners, private
equity groups Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Permira.


At a meeting on Wednesday, ProSiebenSAT1's supervisory board
authorised the management board "to enter into the examination
process and to evaluate the possible acquisition of SBS
Broadcasting Group," the free-to-air broadcaster said in a
statement.


To this end, a independent directors' committee would be set up
to examine the matter.


"After a comprehensive due diligence and on the basis of a
fairness opinion by investment bank Citigroup, as well as an
independent company valuation by audit firm Susat, a final
decision is expected towards mid-2007," ProSiebenSAT1 said.


"A combination with SBS Broadcasting Group would represent an
attractive growth opportunity. Combining both groups to a leading
European TV provider would offer excellent perspectives," said
chief executive Guillaume de Posch.


ProSiebenSAT1, which owns the SAT1, ProSieben, Kabel1 and N24
channels, was recently taken over by Lavena Holding 4 GmbH, a
holding company controlled by KKR and Permira.


Lavena owns a stake of 50.5 percent in the broadcaster.


KKR and Permira also hold a majority stake in SBS Broadcasting
Group.
