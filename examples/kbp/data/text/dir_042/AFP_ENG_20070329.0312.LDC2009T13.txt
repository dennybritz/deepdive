The new Palestinian finance minister will visit Brussels April 11
to discuss financial aid for Palestinians, EU External Relations
Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said Thursday.


Ferrero-Waldner said she had "accepted" last week to the
principle of Salam Fayyad visiting Brussels, confirming that the
European Union has renewed contacts with non-Hamas members of the
new Palestinian unity government.


EU foreign ministers, who are to meet in Bremen, Germany on
Friday and Saturday, are to discuss what stand to take towards
the new government and financial aid.


The government, a mix of Western-backed moderates and Hamas
militants, wants direct aid payments to it to resume, amid dire
economic hardship and heavy violence in the Palestinian
territories.


The EU was the biggest aid donor to the Palestinian government
until Hamas came to power in March 2006.


Since then, the 27-nation bloc has redirected its aid, which
reached 700 million euros in 2006, through a special mechanism to
help the most needy people while bypassing the government to
avoid contact with Hamas.


Like the United States, the EU considers the militant Muslim
group a terrorist organisation.
