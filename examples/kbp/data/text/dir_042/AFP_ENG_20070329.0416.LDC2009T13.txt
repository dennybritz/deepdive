German international forward Oliver Neuville has signed a two-
year extension to his contract with the Bundesliga's bottom side
Borussia Monchengladbach, the club announced on Thursday.


Neuville, 33, has been at 'Gladbach since 2004, who are anchored
to the bottom of the German championship table and are five
points away from safety.


"I am settled at the club and in the city and I don't think we
are going to get relegated," said the striker, who has won 65
caps and played in the 2002 World Cup final against Brazil.


"But if we had to go down, I would do everything to help
'Gladbach get back into the German elite as quickly as possible,"
he added.


Before joining Monchengladbach, Neuville played for Bayer
Leverkusen (1999-2004) and Rostock (1997-99), after a season in
Spain with Tenerife.
