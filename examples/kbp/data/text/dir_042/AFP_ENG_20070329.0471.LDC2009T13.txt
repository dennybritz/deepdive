Croatia has offerred Bosnia priviledges at a key port in order to
solve a lengthy dispute over the issue, Prime Minister Ivo
Sanader said here Thursday.


"We offered Bosnia the status of most favoured nation" at the
Adriatic port of Ploce, Sanader told journalists after meeting
his Bosnian counterpart Nikola Spiric.


Sanader, who is on a two-day visit to Bosnia, did not elaborate
on the deal, but the status gives countries benefits such as low
tarriffs.


Spiric said the Bosnian government would study the offer before
giving its response.


Any deal would give Bosnia access to the Adriatic coast more than
eight years after the two countries first forged an agreement on
the issue.


Zagreb and Sarajevo signed the accord late in 1998, but its
approval has since been blocked by Croatia's parliament.


Bosnia has a 10-kilometre (six-mile) coastline, but since
Croatia's 1991-1995 war it has been forced to enter the Adriatic
through the small port of Neum, which is inaccessible for large
vessels.


Sarajevo had sought special status at Ploce since it had invested
the most in the port's infrastructure when the two countries were
republics in the former Yugoslavia.


Ploce has railway links to Sarajevo and is also an end point of
the so-called VC Corridor, a planned highway through Bosnia that
would link the Hungarian capital Budapest with the Adriatic
coast.
