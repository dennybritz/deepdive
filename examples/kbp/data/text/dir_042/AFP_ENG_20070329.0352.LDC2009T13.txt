The second world sudoku championships opened in Prague on
Thursday with 140 entrants from 32 countries competing to become
the top player of the popular numerical logic game, organisers
said.


"It is the cream of the world elite, a real sudoku 'brain trust'
which has gathered in Prague," said tournament organiser
Vitezslav Koudelka.


Current world champion, 32-year-old Czech, Jana Tylova, told AFP
ahead of the competition that she expected a much tougher contest
than in Italy last year, when she took the title ahead of 87
opponents from 22 countries.


Sudoku fans worldwide have been invited to follow the
tournament's progress on line on the website

Czech President Vaclav Klaus, a keen player, is expected to
attend the finals on Saturday, organisers added.


Sudoku, a sort of numerical crossword, was invented by Swiss
mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.


The challenge is to fill a nine by nine grid so that each column,
each row, and each of the nine three by three internal squares
contains only the numbers from one to nine.


Revived at the end of the 1980's, the game has recently enjoyed a
worldwide boom.
