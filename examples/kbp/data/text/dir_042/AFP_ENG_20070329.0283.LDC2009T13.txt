Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas urged Israel on Thursday to
accept a revived Arab peace plan in order "not to miss another
chance" to resolve the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.


The peace offer "must be turned into a practical and
comprehensive plan... applicable without any change in its
clauses or even its text," Abbas said in a speech to the Arab
summit.


Arab leaders decided on Wednesday to reactivate the 2002
blueprint which offers Israel peace and normal ties if it
withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 war, allows the
creation of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian
refugees.


"From here, I confirm the Palestinians' will to extend a hand of
peace to the Israeli people," he said.


"I call on this people and its leaders to respond to this
dream... so that we can realise it together, with the support of
Arab and Islamic states as well as the whole international
community and so that we don't miss another chance."
