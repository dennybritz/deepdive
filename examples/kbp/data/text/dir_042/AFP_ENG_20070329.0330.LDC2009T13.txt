France will kick-off the defence of their Six Nations crown
against Scotland on February 3, 2008.


The French have won four of the last six editions of the
tournament and will be firm favourites to retain the title when
they begin the campaign with a trip to Murrayfield to face
Scotland.


Ireland, who finished second, begin at home to Italy on February
2 in the opening match of the competition and then face a
daunting trip to France a week later.


England will launch their campaign against Wales at Twickenham on
February 2. The Welsh, who beat England in Cardiff in the last
fixture of this year's Six Nations, have not won at English
rugby's headquarters since 1988.


Once again there are two 'Super Saturdays', with three games
being played on February 23 and March 15.


Six Nations chairman Jacques Laurans said: "The dust has barely
settled on one of the most exciting tournaments in recent
history, yet we can now look forward in detail to the challenges
of next year."
