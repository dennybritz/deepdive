Iran said on Thursday that a group of British sailors had entered
its waters at six different points before they were arrested, the
official IRNA news agency reported.


"These 15 British troops in two boats... had entered and stayed
in Iran's territorial waters at six points before they were
arrested by the patrols," IRNA quoted an unnamed navy official as
saying.


Iran has defied international calls to free the 15 sailors it
seized in the northern Gulf on Friday for "illegal entry" into
its waters while Britain has presented documents which it says
shows they were in Iraqi waters.


"The coast guards have documented and filmed British forces
violating international law," the Iranian official said.


"Their entry and stay in our waters is certain according to the
information recorded on the British sailors' GPS."


Later on Thursday an Iranian military commander appeared on state
TV showing charts and a GPS "seized from the British sailors". He
said the information on the GPS showed the sailors were detained
in Iranian waters after entering six times.


The television identified the man only as General Setareh,
commander of coastal border patrols in Arvand -- the Iranian name
for the Shatt al-Arab waterway between Iran and Iraq where the
sailors were captured.
