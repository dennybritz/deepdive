Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, spouted a "fountain of
lava" early Thursday before slipping back into its fitful
slumber, a spokesman of Italy's vulcanology institute said.


"The eruption, a fountain of lava, lasted about an hour and
happened in an uninhabited area," the spokesman told AFP by
telephone from Catania, a town on the east coast of Sicily about
20 kilometres (12 miles) from Etna.


A small cloud of ash produced by the eruption is floating towards
the mainland, he added.


Etna was last active in December, spewing clouds of ash and
causing the closure of Catania airport for about two weeks.


Mount Etna, which is 3,295 meters (10,800 feet) tall, had been
dormant since July 2006.
