English county side Leicestershire have awarded a contract to
seam bowler Sukhvir Singh who emerged the winner of the Cricket
Star reality television show in India.


The 20-year-old fast bowler from Chandigarh, the son of a bus
driver, emerged as the winner of the programme which attracted an
estimated television audience of 60 million.


"Sukhvir will enjoy all the privileges of a professional
cricketer with us," said Leicestershire coach Tim Boon.


"He will go through all the fitness testing and screening as well
as practicing with the squad. We hope to play him in some second
team games.


"We will also be looking to integrate him into the local
community, which is a key part of the strategy going forward in
terms of developing closer links and raising our profile on the
sub-continent."


Leicestershire, who have worked in partnership with Investors in
Cricket, the backers of the television show, recently returned
from a pre-season tour of India and Sri Lanka when they played a
special 20/20 match against the Cricket Star Finalists XI in
Mumbai, a side which featured Singh.


On that tour, the English side also signed up Indian left arm
seamer R.P. Singh as their second overseas player to accompany
Pakistan all-rounder Mansoor Amjad for the 2007 season.


"Sukhvir comes from a humble background but he impressed everyone
with his desire to succeed," added Boon.


"He has an exceptional attitude, he is very fit and very focussed
on making the grade."
