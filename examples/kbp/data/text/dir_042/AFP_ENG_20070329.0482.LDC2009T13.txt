Kenny Rogers, the 41-year-old southpaw pitcher who helped the
Detroit Tigers reach last year's World Series, was placed on the
disabled list Thursday, the club announced.


Rogers will not be able to join the Tigers until April 9, a week
into the six- month Major League Baseball season.


The Tigers described the reason for his absence as a fatigued
arm, with tests scheduled later Thursday.


"I don't think it's a long-term thing," Tigers president and
general manager Dave Dombrowski said.


Rogers tossed six scoreless innings against Atlanta five days
ago. He has a 2.05 earned-run average in pre-season games for the
defending American League champions, who lost last October's
championship series to St. Louis.


Rogers is preparing for his 20th major league season. He has
compiled a 207-139 record since starting with the Texas Rangers
in 1989, also pitching for New York Yankees, Oakland A's New York
Mets, Minnesota Twins and the Tigers.


After being pounded for five runs on five hits in two innings for
the Yankees in the 1996 World Series, Rogers received another
chance to pitch in the best-of- seven final and allowed only two
hits in eight innings in a masterpiece effort that produced the
only Tigers triumph.
