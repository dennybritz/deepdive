At least 93 people were killed when an upturned oil tanker burst
into flames as it was being looted in northern Nigeria, according
to a new toll established on Thursday by safety officials.


"The death toll has increased to 93", Kasaba Musa Haruna, the
spokesman for the Federal Road Safety Corps in Kaduna told AFP.


Eighty-five people died outright in the tanker blaze on Monday
evening while 101 others were hospitalized with varying degrees
of burns. Eight of those treated in hospital have now died of
their burns, Haruna said.


Police said the accident happened on Monday evening in Kaduna
State as the tanker tried to park in the village of Katugal, some
150 kilometres (90 miles) south of the state capital Kaduna.


Villagers were thronging around the vehicle to loot its valuable
cargo when it erupted in flames.


It was not clear if the impact of the accident caused the fuel to
leak or whether the vehicle was vandalised.


"The tanker turned over, the villagers came to scoop fuel and
then the tanker caught fire," a local police spokesman said on
Wednesday.
