Bayern Munich decided on Thursday not to appeal UEFA's one-match
ban handed to captain Oliver Kahn and will play next week's
Champions League quarter-final against AC Milan without the
veteran.


Having announced on Monday that they would contest Kahn's ban and
20,000 Swiss francs (12,339 euros) fine, the German giants said
in a statement they had reversed the decision to concentrate on
Tuesday's game in Milan.


The 37-year-old German international was banned and fined by
UEFA's disciplinary committee for improper conduct at the doping
control after his club's Champions League win over Real Madrid at
the start of March.


Kahn's appeal had been scheduled for Monday, but the club took
the decision to accept the decision so coach Ottmar Hitzfeld can
prepare for the Milan game the next day, as well as Saturday's
visit of Bundesliga leaders Schalke 04.


The loss of Kahn means Hitzfeld will play Michael Rensing against
AC Milan. The 22-year-old made his only previous Champions League
appearance at the Allianz Arena last year in the 1-1 draw with -
coincidentally - AC Milan.


"It will be the highlight of my career so far," Rensing said.


"I've made a few appearances in the Bundesliga and for the
Germany under 21s, but in terms of significance, Milan will be
very special."


And Hitzfeld has no doubts Rensing is ready for the challenge.


"He is itching to play, he has my complete trust and that of the
team," said the coach.
