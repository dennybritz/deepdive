Some 18 people were killed as Algerian government troops battled
Islamic militants in the Kabylie region east of the capital,
local correspondents told AFP on Thursday.


They said heavily-armed troops and government militia had
surrounded between 50 and 80 members of the Al-Qaeda-linked
Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) in a hideout in
the Amizour district.


To try to break out, the militants had attacked an army roadblock
on Wednesday, killing three soldiers. In a counter-attack,
government forces killed some 15 of the rebels, including a mid-
ranking leader.


There was no immediate official confirmation of the clash.


Algerian security forces are stepping up an offensive against the
GSPC, raiding targets in cities and mountain hideouts, with
deaths on both sides.


The army has been scouring the mountainous Kabylie region in an
attempt to to flush out the estimated 300 fighters hidden there.


The GSPC, which now dubs itself the "Armed Branch of Al-Qaeda in
Islamic Maghreb", has claimed responsibility for a series of
deadly attacks, including on foreigners, in Algeria.


It is also active in other countries, notably Tunisia.
