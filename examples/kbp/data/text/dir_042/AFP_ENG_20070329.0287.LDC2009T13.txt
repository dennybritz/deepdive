American Leila Vaziri equalled the world record she set the
previous day in capturing the women's 50-metres backstroke world
title on Thursday.


Vaziri hit the wall in 28.16 seconds in an extraordinary repeat
of her semi- final swim on Wednesday.


She held off a strong finish by Aliaksandra Herasimenia of
Belarus (28.46) and Australian Tayliah Zimmer (28.50) who took
bronze.


Vaziri used the motivation of not reaching the final of the 100m
backstroke event to go after the 50m title.


"I was a little bit disappointed not making the top eight, so I
took it out in this event," she said.


"In the semi I knew we would be spread out, and I knew the finals
were going to be very tough."
