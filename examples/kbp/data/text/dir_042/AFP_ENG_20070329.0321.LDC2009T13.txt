Iraq's Kurdish President Jalal Talabani said on Thursday that the
US-led invasion of his country four years ago had turned into an
"occupation" with dire consequences for Iraq.


"The decision to turn the liberation of Iraq into an
occupation... with the dire consequences this had internally and
the fears (it aroused) in Arab, regional and international
arenas, all this was contrary to what Iraqi parties and national
forces were planning at the time," he said a speech to an Arab
summit .


"This applies equally to many hasty decisions and measures taken
by the occupation's civil administration without understanding
the Iraqis' point of view and the consequences they had on the
situation in the country and the political process as a whole,"
he said.
