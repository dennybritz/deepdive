US President George W. Bush on Thursday renewed his threat to
veto legislation funding the war in Iraq but calling for a
pullout of US troops by next year.


"I'll veto a bill that restricts our commanders on the ground in
Iraq, a bill that doesn't fund our troops, a bill that's got too
much spending on it," Bush said after meeting with Republican
congressional allies.


The Senate was to take up a war funding bill that includes a
binding provision to withdraw US troops from the war-torn
country, where more than 3,235 American soldiers have died, by
March 31, 2008.


Bush has denounced any effort to set a deadline for a US
withdrawal and assailed Democrats for adding unrelated spending
to the emergency package, which would also pay for the war in
Afghanistan.


"When we've got a troop in harm's way, we expect that troop to be
fully funded. When we've got commanders making tough decisions on
the ground, we expect there to be no strings on our commanders,"
said Bush.
