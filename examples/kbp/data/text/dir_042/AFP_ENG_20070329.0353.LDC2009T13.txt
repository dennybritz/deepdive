EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged European Union member
states on Thursday to debate US plans to install part of its
missile shield in the Czech Republic and Poland.


"I think this is a subject that can and should be debated in the
European Union," he told members of the European Parliament in
Brussels. "The European Union is not a defence alliance but it
does have a defence policy."


"We should not take decisions but it would be a mistake not to
talk about these things amongst ourselves in the clearest way
possible," he said.


German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country holds the EU's
rotating presidency until the end of June, has said the anti-
missile system should be debated at NATO.


Russia sees the plans to base 10 missile interceptors in Poland,
a radar in the Czech Republic, and another in the Caucasus, as
intimidation and has warned its old Cold War enemy it would come
up with a "highly effective response."


"Any decision can effect relations with Russia," Solana said,
noting that the "sovereign interests of (EU) member states must
be compatible with the general interests of the European Union."


Parts of the shield are already in place in the United States,
Britain and Greenland, and Pentagon officials say the plan is to
have the system operational by 2013.


Washington acknowledges that the system primarily protects US
soil from attack by "rogue states" like Iran but that it would
also shield some, though not all, European allies.
