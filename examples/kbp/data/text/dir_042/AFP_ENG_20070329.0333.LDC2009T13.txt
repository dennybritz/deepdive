Zimbabwe's opposition has approached the government to relaunch
talks to pacify the country's volatile political climate, a
Zimbabwean official said on the sidelines of a summit here
Thursday.


Southern African leaders were meeting in Tanzania to discuss the
Zimbabwe crisis after arrests and beatings of members of the main
opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).


"Both factions of the MDC have already communicated with our
justice minister to suggest a resumption of conduct (talks) that
we used to have," a top government official told AFP in Dar es
Salaam.


"We used to have this and they (the opposition) called them off,"
he added, asking not to be named.


Leaders gathered for the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) meeting on Wednesday as Zimbabwean police raided the
headquarters of the main opposition party, increasing
international calls for the regional leaders to speak out against
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.


Tanzanian officials said SADC chiefs would try to convince Mugabe
to meet the MDC leaders in a bid to dissolve mounting acrimony
that threatens Zimbabwe's stability.
