The United States has no reason "to choose a confrontational
path" with Iran, US Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns said
Thursday.


"There is no reason for us to choose a confrontational path now,"
Burns told Congress, amid rising tensions over Iran's detention
of 15 British naval personnel accused of entering Iranian waters.


"We believe diplomacy can succeed and we do not believe that
conflict with Iran is inevitable."
