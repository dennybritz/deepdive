Iran on Thursday demanded an apology from Britain over what it
said was the "illegal entry" of British sailors into its waters.


"The logical solution to resolving this affair is for the British
authorities to accept the realty, present their apologies to the
great Iranian people," General Alireza Afshar, spokesman for the
head of the country's armed forces, was quoted as saying by the
semi-official Mehr news agency.
