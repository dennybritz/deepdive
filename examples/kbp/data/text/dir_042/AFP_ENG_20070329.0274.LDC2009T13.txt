Indian share prices closed up 0.74 percent on Thursday, snapping
three days of losses, on buying in export-linked software stocks
after the Indian rupee fell against the dollar, dealers said.


They said sentiment was also bolstered by falling oil prices.


The 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex index rose 95.32 points
to 12,979.66.


Dealers said the bounceback for the Sensex could be short as
investors fear that India's central bank could raise rates next
month after India's inflation rate held steady at 6.46 percent
last Friday.


The RBI will decide full-year monetary policy on April 24 this
year.


"Global tensions relating to oil prices eased and there was some
strong buying in software stocks as the rupee fell against the
dollar," said Advait Date, a dealer at brokerage BHH Securities.


Dealers also said there was a smooth rollover of most stock
positions to the next futures market contract which begins
Friday.


Gainers led losers 1,584 to 927 on volume of 36.64 billion rupees
(845 million dollars).


The rupee fell to 43.4 against the dollar from 43.1 and weakened
against the euro to 57.8 from 57.5.


India's largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)
rose 46 rupees or 3.83 percent to 1,247 while Wipro rose 7.35
rupees or 1.32 percent to 565.55 rupees.
