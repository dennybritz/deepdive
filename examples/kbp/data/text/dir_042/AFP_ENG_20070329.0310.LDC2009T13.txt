Portugal has opened one of the biggest solar panel plants in the
world.


More than 8,000 homes were Thursday enjoying the benefits of the
52,000 panels covering spread over 60 hectares (150 acres) in the
Alentejo region of southern Portugal, one of the sunniest spots
in Europe.


The panels can generate 11 megawatts of electricity.


GE Energy, one of the companies behind the project, said that
while a similar generator just opened in Bavaria, Germany, had a
theoretically greater capacity, the plant in Serpa would be more
productive because of the greater amount of sunshine.


Costing more than 60 million euros, it will save an estimated
30,000 tonnes a year of greenhouse gases.


Portugal's aim is to generate 45 percent of its energy from
renewable sources in the next few years.
