Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal accused Israel on Thursday
of consistently rejecting Arab peace offers, after it refused to
accept a revived Middle East peace plan.


"Such a position from Israel is not surprising. This has always
been its approach. Whenever the Arabs come up with resolutions
... (offering) peace, they reject them categorically," he told
reporters after an Arab summit in Riyadh which revived a 2002
peace blueprint.


"This does not express a positive stand of a country that wants
peace," he said.


Saud said the Arabs decided to "hold fast to their peace proposal
because it is a reasonable one."


But "it takes two to do the dabkeh," Saud said in English,
referring to a folk dance popular in several Arab countries.


The blueprint offers Israel full normalisation of relations if it
withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the
creation of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian
refugees.


Israeli officials on Thursday refused to accept the revived Arab
peace initiative as it currently stands, saying negotiations were
needed.


Israel has identified the return of refugees as a main stumbling
block.
