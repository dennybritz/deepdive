US economic momentum is likely to decline this year to a pace
slower than the 2.9 percent forecast in September by the
International Monetary Fund, the head of the IMF said Thursday.


"We'll probably see that number of September ... reduced, but not
in a significant way," Rato said here, where he met with Dutch
government officials.


He said problems plaguing the US residential housing market,
along with concerns about mortgage foreclosures, could have an
impact on US consumer spending.


But he added that the negative effect would be offset by strong
household earnings and a healthy labor market.


The US economy, he predicted, should therefore experience a "soft
landing" this year and "a certain recovery" in 2008.


In Washington Thursday the Commerce Department said the economy
expanded at a 2.5 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter
of 2006, a bit faster than earlier estimates.


The revision for gross domestic product (GDP) was up from a 2.2
percent estimate released a month earlier.


The latest data meant growth for the full year 2006 was 3.3
percent, unchanged the estimate last month.
