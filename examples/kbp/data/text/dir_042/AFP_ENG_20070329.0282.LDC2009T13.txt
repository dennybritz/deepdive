World oil prices rose in trading here on Thursday, rebounding
above 66 dollars a barrel in London, after Iran decided against
releasing a female British sailor detained with 14 male
colleagues.


In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for May delivery
gained 49 cents to 66.27 dollars a barrel in electronic trading.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, climbed 11 cents to 64.19 dollars in electronic
deals before the official opening of the US market.


Prices had dipped slightly earlier Thursday, after recent surges
linked also to Iran. Analysts have said the world's fourth
biggest producer of crude might decide to disrupt its crude
exports should tensions with the West escalate.


A defiant Iran said on Thursday that it would not release as
promised the British woman sailor because of Britain's
"incorrect" attitude in the escalating crisis.


The announcement by the head of Iran's supreme national security
council Ali Larijani came a day after London froze ties with
Tehran and despite the intervention of UN chief Ban Ki-Moon.


As well as its standoff with Britain over detained sailors, Iran
refuses to bow to international pressure over its disputed
nuclear programme.
