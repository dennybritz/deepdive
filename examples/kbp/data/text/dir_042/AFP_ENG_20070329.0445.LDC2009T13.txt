The price of human life has gone up in Iran, with the official
blood money rate -- or cash paid out in the case of violent death
-- rising 34 percent to 37,600 dollars for a man, and half that
for a woman.


Justice Minister Gholam Hossein Elham said the blood money rate
was set at 350 million rials for the current Iranian year which
began on March 21, the official IRNA news agency reported on
Thursday.


Under Islamic law in force in Iran, anybody who kills another
person has to pay compensation -- known as blood money or "diyeh"
-- to the victim's family who can refuse it and demand the
murderer be executed.


Convicted murderers can avoid being hanged by paying blood money
to relatives who will accept it, but they may also have to serve
a jail term.


Blood money is also built into vehicle insurance as compensation
in cases that result in death.


The total paid for a woman is still half that for a man, although
women's rights activists have been campaigning for equal value in
the eyes of the law.


Iran's recognized religious minorities -- Jews, Christians and
Zoroastrians -- were in 2003 awarded equal blood money status,
having previously been valued at half that of a Muslim.
