Five people were injured in an accident during practice for the
Portuguese Rally here on Thursday.


A Portuguese photographer suffered a broken leg and another
person suffered a broken arm after a car came off the road,
according to organisers.


Three more people suffered minor injuries but were nonetheless
taken to hospital.


The five were in a security zone where they should not have been
when Portuguese driver Armindo Araujo's Mitsubishi went off the
track just before 10am local time.


The practice session was stopped for 45 minutes as secutiry
services tended to the injured.


It is the first time since 2001 that the Rally of Portugal has
been included in the World Rally Championship calendar and around
a million spectators are expected to watch throughout the
weekend.
