Sweden's Queen Silvia, rounding off a visit to Japan, met
Thursday with animation maestro Hayao Miyazaki, who is famous not
only for his films but for shunning public appearances.


The queen spent a part of her afternoon without her husband King
Carl XVI Gustaf at Studio Ghibli, where she had coffee with
Miyazaki, whose hits include "Princess Mononoke" and the Oscar-
winning "Spirited Away."


"The queen took a tour of the museum and watched a short
presentation on Miyazaki's latest movie, 'Ponyo on a Cliff',"
said a Studio Ghibli spokeswoman.


"Ponyo," about a goldfish who wants to be a human, is due out
next year.


The Swedish king and queen are on a weeklong visit to Japan that
included audiences with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko,
tours of art museums and a stop in the countryside. In an unusual
move, Japan's emperor and empress went to the Swedish royals'
hotel Thursday to farewell them before they left Tokyo.


Silvia, who has worked in Sweden to improve care for the elderly
and people with disabilities, also took part in a forum Monday in
Tokyo where she called for broader support for people with
dementia.


The royal couple end their visit to Japan with a trip to the
southern city of Nagasaki Friday, the site of the world's second
and last nuclear attack in 1945, before leaving Saturday.
