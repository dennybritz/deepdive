Chelsea striker Didier Drogba has made a visit to Ivory Coast's
separatist north and called on the country as a whole to unite in
peace.


The African footballer of the year took his African Player of the
Year golden ball award to Bouake in the north to show to the
people.


Ivory Coast has been split in two sine a failed coup d'etat
against president Laurent Gbagbo in 2002, with the northern half
controlled by the New Forces rebels and the south by Gbagbo's
government.


Drogba was given a hero's welcome by New Forces general secretary
and new Ivory Coast prime minister Guillaume Soro.


"I have come here to offer you a golden ball, it's the golden
ball for the whole of the Ivory Coast," said Drogba from a podium
on the famous Carnival Square.


"This is only the beginning. In June the whole Ivory Coast
national team will be at Bouake for the match against Madagascar
(in an African Nations Cup qualifier).


"June 3 will be a memorable day, it will be the victory for Ivory
Coast football, the victory of the Ivory Coast people and quite
simply there will be peace."
