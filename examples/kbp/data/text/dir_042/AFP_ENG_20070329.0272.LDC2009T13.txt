Park Ji-Sung admits he would sacrifice success in Europe if it
means Manchester United can win the Premiership.


United are challenging for the Premiership, the Champions League
and the FA Cup, but South Korean winger Park is adamant that the
English league title is the only trophy that matters to him.


While the Champions League is regarded as Europe's elite club
prize, it is domestic glory that is motivating Park as United try
to end Chelsea's two-year reign as Premiership champions.


Sir Alex Ferguson's table-toppers are six points ahead of second-
placed Chelsea and look perfectly placed to fulfil Park's
ambition to bring the title back to Old Trafford for the first
time since 2003.


"It is possible for us to get the results to succeed in all
competitions," Park said on ManUtd.com. "But, personally, my
number one target is the Premier League."


Park knows exactly what it takes to land more than one trophy in
a season after winning the league and cup double with PSV
Eindhoven.


He insists United must hold their nerve if results go against
them. "I have had a similar experience in the Netherlands," he
said. "Even if we have bad results, we have to bounce back
quickly and concentrate on the next game."
