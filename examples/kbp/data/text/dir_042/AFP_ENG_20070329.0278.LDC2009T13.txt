Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific said Thursday it will
develop a carbon- offset scheme to offset its greenhouse gas
emissions generated by travel in a bid to counter the impact of
climate change.


The airline said it would invest in projects that would improve
efficiency and reduce fuel burn as part of its contribution to
limit any adverse impact on the environment caused by flying.


Aviation is viewed as one of the biggest contributors to carbon
emissions.


Cathay said it would allow its passengers to choose if they
wanted to join the scheme, which is increasingly common in Europe
and the United States. It did not say how the passengers could
take part.


Cathay chief executive Philip Chen called for the aviation
industry to push towards improved technology in order to counter
climate change.


He said infrastructure changes were also needed to address fuel
wastage created by inadequate route and air-traffic management.


He said emission trading would help drive overall emissions
reduction and urged the International Civil Aviation Organisation
to take the lead in the pushing for reductions.
