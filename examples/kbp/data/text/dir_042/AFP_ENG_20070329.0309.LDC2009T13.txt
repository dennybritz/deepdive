Portugal is willing to provide medical treatment to former
Democratic Republic of Congo vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba,
whose guard clashed with the army in Kinsasha last week, a
newspaper reported Thursday.


Discussions were underway with the DRC government to allow ex-
rebel leader Bemba to leave the country for treatment of a leg
injury, Paula Mascarenhas, spokeswoman for Portugal's foreign
ministry, told Correio da Manha newspaper.


"Portugal would not object if he wishes to come here to undergo
medical treatment," she said.


The injury is unrelated to last week's fighting in the DRC
capital of Kinshasa in which at least 163 have been reported
dead.


Diplomatic sources said Wednesday Bemba needed treatment for a
leg injury sustained during a fall down steps in December.


Bemba visited Portugal "four or five months ago" for a leg
operation, said Mascarenhas.


Bemba also has a home in Quinta do Lago in southern Portugal.


The fighting on March 22 and 23 occurred after Bemba refused to
have his guard integrated into the regular army.


About 2,000 government troops overcame some 700 fighters loyal to
Bemba, who is also a failed presidential candidate.


Bemba fled to the South African embassy, where he has remained.
President Joseph Kabila's government has issued an arrest warrant
for him on charges of treason and maintaining a militia.


Many of Bemba's guard members have begun turning themselves into
the military.


In theory, Bemba enjoys parliamentary immunity because of his
seat in the senate. That immunity can only be lifted by
parliament.


Bemba supporters have told AFP they would like to see him safely
out of the country for the time being.
