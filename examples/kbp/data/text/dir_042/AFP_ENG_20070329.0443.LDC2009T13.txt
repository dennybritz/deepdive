Mauritania's constitutional council officially confirmed Sidi
Ould Cheikh Abdallahi on Thursday as the country's first
democratically elected president since independence.


Ould Abdallahi, a 69-year-old former political prisoner and ex-
government minister, won 52.85 percent of the votes in Sunday's
second round presidential run-off against Ahmed Ould Daddah.


The elections were the final stage of democratic reforms led by
the military junta that overturned the regime of Maaouiya Ould
Taya in August 2005.


Constitutional council president Abdallahi Ould Ely Salem Ould
Salem, who made Thursday's announcment said the council had not
received any complaints or appeals against the election result by
the deadline of midnight on Wednesday.


Ould Daddah, a long time opposition politician and former
political prisoner, had already accepted his defeat.


Ould Abdallahi is the first democratically elected president in
Mauritania, a largely desert country in north-west Africa, since
independence in 1960.


Previous presidents have seized power by force, and have been re-
elected in the first round of elections marred by fraud.
