Rangers striker Dado Prso is considering retirement after
announcing on Thursday that a recurring knee injury will force
him to leave the Scottish Premier League club at the end of the
season.


Prso, 32, has been told he cannot continue to play top-flight
football  because the long-term knee problem that has troubled
him throughout his time at Ibrox will not be able to cope with
the strain.


The Croatian, who will wait to see if he can play at a lower
level before confirming his future plans, told Rangers' website:
"I see my specialist every year and I went to see him this week
for my usual appointment. He told me the situation with my knee
is not getting any better and as a result I will need more and
more rest.


"That is why I have decided that I won't be able to play for
Rangers next season. It is so frustrating for me. I knew I would
have to stop playing one day, but that doesn't make it any easier
when the times comes."
