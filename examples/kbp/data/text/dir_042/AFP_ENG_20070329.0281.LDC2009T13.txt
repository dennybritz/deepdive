The United States regained the world record off Germany with a
sensational victory in an outside lane in the women's 4x200 metre
freestyle relay at the world championships Thursday.


Spurred by a sizzling opening swim by Natalie Coughlin, the
Americans were always under world record pace and clocked a new
mark of seven minutes 50.09 seconds to beat home Germany
(7:53.82) by 3.73 seconds with France (7:55.96) third.


It was the American team's seventh world record at the meet in an
outstanding display 16 months away from the Beijing Olympics.


"I had no idea how well I was doing. I couldn't see anybody. I
couldn't tell if I was going fast or not, but I felt strong,"
Coughlin said.


She swept past Australian Libby Lenton to dictate the race in the
opening leg and clocked 1:56.43 to be followed by Dana Vollmer
(1:57.49), Lacey Nymeyer (1:59.19) and Katie Hoff (1:56.98).


"This is my first time being on a record breaking relay. I feel
so honoured. Everyone did such an amazing job," Hoff said.


It was an extraordinary performance from the Americans, who just
scraped into the final with a qualifying time of 8:02.87, but
were considerably bolstered by the addition of Coughlin and
medley gold medallist Hoff in the lineup for the final.


The United States have won a medal in this event at every world
championships since the debut of the 4x200m freestyle in 1986,
apart from Perth in 1991 where they were disqualified in the
final.


The Americans won the gold medal in Athens 2004 after setting a
world record time of 7:53.42, which was subsequently broken by
Germany at last year's European championships.
