A Greek fan was killed on Thursday and five others were injured
in roadside clashes that erupted on the sidelines of a Greek
women's volleyball match outside Athens, police sources said.


The incident between fans of Greek arch-rivals Olympiakos Piraeus
and Panathinaikos Athens broke out in Peania, 27 kilometres east
of the capital.


According to reports, hooligans from both sides began clashing
outside the volleyball stadium and the fighting spilled onto the
neighbouring highway.


The dead fan was rushed to an Athens hospital with serious head
injuries, a hospital official told AFP. The cause of death is
still unclear.


Police detained 18 people.


A number of cars on the highway were assaulted and damaged during
the clash.


"They nearly cracked my head open," a driver told NET state
television. "If the police had taken longer to intervene they
would have burned us alive."


Fan violence routinely mars Greek sport, usually centred around
football and basketball but occasionally affecting other sports
such as waterpolo and volleyball.


The rival hooligan groups had apparently arranged to meet for the
fight, the police source said.
