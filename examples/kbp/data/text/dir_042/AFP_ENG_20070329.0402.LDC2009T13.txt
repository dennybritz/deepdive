Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal accused Israel on Thursday
of consistently rejecting Arab peace offers, after it refused to
accept a revived Middle East peace plan.


"Such a position from Israel is not surprising. This has always
been its approach. Whenever the Arabs come up with resolutions
... (offering) peace, they reject them categorically," he told
reporters after an Arab summit in Riyadh which revived a 2002
peace blueprint.


"This does not express a positive stand of a country that wants
peace," he said.
