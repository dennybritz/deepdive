Britain's ambassador to Tehran lodged a formal protest Thursday
over the television footage of the British sailors seized in the
northern Gulf, the Foreign Office here said.


"Today the British ambassador in Tehran met with Iranian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs officials to protest about the TV pictures of
Leading Seaman Faye Turney," a Foreign Office spokesman told AFP.


Ambassador Geoffrey Adams "also demanded the immediate release of
our 15 personnel, information about their whereabouts, and
consular access as a prelude to their release," the spokesman
said.


The officials "were unable to answer any of these points," he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.


Iranian television showed the Britons having a meal and featured
the only woman among the group, Turney, 26, wearing a black
headscarf and saying: "Obviously we trespassed in the waters."
