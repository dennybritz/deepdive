The German government has asked for tougher EU sanctions against
Zimbabwe in protest at President Robert Mugabe's crackdown on the
opposition, Deputy Foreign Minister Gernot Erler said Thursday.


The European Union will next discuss a German proposal to widen
its travel ban on high-ranking Zimbabwean officials next
Wednesday, Erler told parliament.


Germany currently holds the presidency of the bloc, which has in
recent weeks repeatedly condemned the Zimbabwean security forces
for violent attacks on the country's political opposition.


Erler said the renewed arrest Wednesday of Morgan Tsvangirai, the
leader of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change,
proved that Mugabe has dropped "any pretence of respecting the
rule of law."


"The end of President Robert Mugabe's rule is nigh," he added.


The EU imposed sanctions, including travel bans and an arms
embargo, on Mugabe's regime after he won elections in 2002 which
the opposition insists were rigged.


The sanctions were extended last month until February 2008.


Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since 1980.
