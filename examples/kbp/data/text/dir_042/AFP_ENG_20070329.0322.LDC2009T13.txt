The US economy expanded a bit faster than earlier believed in the
fourth quarter, with growth estimated at a 2.5 percent pace in
revised data released Thursday.


The Commerce Department revision for gross domestic product (GDP)
showed a bit more activity than the 2.2 percent estimate released
a month earlier.


Much of the upward revision came from a higher level of
inventories, which could mean lower output in the current
quarter.


The latest data meant growth for the full year 2006 was 3.3
percent, unchanged the estimate last month.


A key inflation index linked to GDP was up 1.0 percent in the
fourth quarter, revised up from 0.9 percent. Core prices, which
exclude food and energy, increased 1.8 percent, revised down from
1.9 percent.
