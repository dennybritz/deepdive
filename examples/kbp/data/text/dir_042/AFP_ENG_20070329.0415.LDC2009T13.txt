Valencia striker Fernando Morientes will miss his club's
Champions League quarter-final matches against Chelsea with a
shoulder injury, the Spanish federation announced here Thursday.


Morientes dislocated a shoulder when he fell awkwardly just
before halftime during Spain's 1-0 win over Iceland in their Euro
2008 qualifier on Wednesday.


"His shoulder will be immobilised for 15 days and he'll be out of
action for three to four weeks, said Spanish team doctor Genaro
Borras.


"The problem is more serious than normal because his shoulder is
unstable due to previous dislocations," added Borras.


Valencia play their first leg against the English champions at
Stamford Bridge next Wednesday with the second leg at home in
their Mestalla stadium on April 10.
