Coordinated suicide car bombings, mortar rounds and roadside
explosions killed at least 43 people and wounded another 86 in
the Iraqi Shiite town of Khalis on Thursday, a security official
said.


The explosions unleashed carnage, killing and maiming men, women
and children during the busy shopping hours ahead of the main
Muslim day of rest on Friday, said Ahmed al-Khadran, brother of
the town's mayor.


The first suicide car bombing targeted a market, the second blew
up near the downtown court house and the third at a new army base
under construction in the city in the restive Diyala province,
Khadran said.


At least nine mortar attacks were also reported in residential
areas while two roadside bombs exploded in a main street near the
market, targeting security and rescue workers who rushed to the
scene of the initial attack.
