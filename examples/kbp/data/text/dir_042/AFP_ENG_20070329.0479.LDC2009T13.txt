An alcohol ban will be enforced for Roma's Champions League
quarter-final first leg against English Premiership leaders
Manchester United next Wednesday in an attempt to prevent crowd
trouble.


Rome police chief Achille Sera said on Thursday that the sale of
alcohol to fans in the Italian capital will be prohibited from
midday on the day of the match until three o'clock the following
morning.


Three fans of English Premiership side Middlesbrough were stabbed
in Rome last year when rival fans clashed before a UEFA Cup
match.
