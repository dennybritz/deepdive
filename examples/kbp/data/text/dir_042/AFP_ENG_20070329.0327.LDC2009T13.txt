Bundesliga side SV Hamburg, the first German club to hand over
their stadium's naming rights, announced on Thursday its playing
arena has a new sponsor - German bank HSH Nordbank.


Having been previously known as the AOL Arena, after Hamburg's
2001 deal with the American Internet providers, from next season
the stadium will be called the HSH Nordbank Arena.


The three-year deal with the northern German bank has an option
for a three-year extension.


"We were the first to have sold rights on the name of our stadium
and we are proud to be the first to re-name our stadium, it shows
that the club and our brand attract well-known advertisers," said
a club spokesman.


Hamburg, the 1977 European champions, are the only club to have
competed in the Bundesliga every year since its creation in 1962.
They are currently 14th in the table, just two points and two
places off the relegation zone.


Twelve of the Bundesliga's 18 clubs have re-named their stadiums
after signing sponsorship deals.
