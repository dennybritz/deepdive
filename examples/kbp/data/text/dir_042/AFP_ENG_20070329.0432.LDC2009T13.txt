The Rwandan government will create an independent commission to
investigate a 1994 attack on a former president's aircraft that
helped trigger the country's genocide, it said Thursday.


The statement from the Rwandan cabinet said it would be an expert
commission, but did not give details on its make-up, nor say when
work would begin.


Former president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed when his plane
was shot down, leading to the 100-day genocide by extremist Hutus
that killed 800,000 people, most of them Tutsi and moderate
Hutus.


A report from French anti-terrorist judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere
names Rwanda's current president, Paul Kagame, as the main
decision-maker behind the attack.


Kagame, who at the time was the head of a group of Rwandan Tutsi
rebels, has always denied any involvement. He told the BBC in an
interview in December that he would accept an inquiry into
Habyarimana's death.


The attack also killed Burundi President Cyprien Ntaryamira, who
was traveling with Habyarimana, and the plane's French crew.


Rwanda will commemorate the 13th anniversary of the genocide on
April 7.


The government also on Thursday announced the extension of the
mandate for a commission investigating France's role in the
genocide.


France has been regularly accused by the current Rwandan
government of having provoked and armed those who committed the
killings. Paris has always denied any involvement.
