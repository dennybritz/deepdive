The late Teddy Kolleck, long-time mayor of Jerusalem, worked for
British intelligence before Israel was founded, informing on
right-wing Jewish radicals, a newspaper reported on Thursday.


His work led to the arrests of dozens of people from the ultra-
nationalist Irgun and Lehi movements who were waging a violent
campaign against British rule, the Maariv daily said, citing
British archives recently opened to the public.


Nicknamed "Scorpion" by his British handlers, Kolleck provided
information aimed at arresting Menahem Begin, but the Irgun
militant, who became prime minister in 1970s Israel, was never
caught.


Kolleck was a giant in Israel's Labour Party for decades, serving
as Jerusalem mayor between 1965 until 1993. He died in January.


Israel was founded in 1948 out of the British mandate the League
of Nations had assigned to Britain after World War I.


During the years leading up to independence, the Labour movement,
headed by David Ben Gurion, conducted a massive arrest campaign
against Irgun and Lehi militants. It accused them of deserting
the Zionist cause with their guerrilla war against British troops
in the last years of the mandate.


Historians have previously said Kollek was in charge of contacts
with the British, but until now no details on his activities have
been revealed.
