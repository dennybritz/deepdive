Lloyd's of London, the insurance and reinsurance market, said
Thursday it made a mammoth pretax profit of 3.662 billion pounds
last year after a loss of 103 million pounds in 2005.


Lloyd's said the pretax profit figure, equivalent to 5.393
billion euros and 7.188 billion dollars, reflected a benign
hurricane season and high prices paid to insure US property and
against "catastrophes."


"2006 was an excellent year for Lloyd's and the market has
performed well," Lloyd's chief executive Richard Ward said in a
statement.


"During the year, we benefited from strong underlying conditions
and an exceptionally low level of catastrophes."


He added that it would be "unrealistic" to expect such a
favourable claims climate this year.


Lloyd's manages some of the world's most complex insurance risks,
from celebrity body parts to oil rigs, and extends billions of
dollars in global coverage.


The market expects to pay out six billion dollars (4.5 billion
euros) in claims related to the record-setting 2005 US hurricane
season, largely due to the devastating impact of Katrina on
southern US states.
