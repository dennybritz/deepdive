Russia is in talks with Algeria on the sale of ships and fighter
jets worth seven billion dollars (5.2 billion euros), the
Kommersant daily said on Thursday.


Algeria invited Russia in March to take part in a tender to
supply ships for its navy, Kommersant said, citing the Russian
federal agency for military-technical cooperation.


Contacted by AFP, the agency declined to comment on the report.


Kommersant said negotiations between Russian and Algerian
officials were also underway for the sale of Sukhoi Su-32 and
Mig-29 bomber jets, Pantsir air defence systems and T-90 tanks.


These deals would come on top of the eight billion dollars in
arms contracts, including for 28 fighter jets, already signed in
2006 for the sale of Russian military equipment to Algeria.


If the deals are confirmed, Algeria would replace India as the
biggest purchaser of Russian arms. Russia has arms contracts with
India amounting to 10 billion dollars between now and 2010,
Kommersant said.
