The French foreign ministry on Thursday called in Iran's
ambassador to Paris to demand the release of 15 British naval
personnel who were detained almost a week ago.


French diplomats conveyed to Ambassador Ali Ahani their "deep
concern" over the detention of the 15 who were seized by Iran
during what Britain said was a routine patrol of Iraqi waters in
the northern Gulf on Friday, said foreign ministry spokesman
Denis Simonneau.


"We recalled our solidarity with the British and asked Iranian
authorities to release as early as possible the detained
sailors," said Simonneau.


"In the meantime, the Iranians must allow them to exercise their
visitation rights," he added.


Tehran maintains that the 15 sailors and marines had trespassed
into Iranian territorial waters.
