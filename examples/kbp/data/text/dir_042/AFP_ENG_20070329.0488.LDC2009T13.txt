Iran said on Thursday that a group of British sailors had entered
its waters at six different points before they were arrested, the
official IRNA news agency reported.


"These 15 British troops in two boats... had entered and stayed
in Iran's territorial waters at six points before they were
arrested by the patrols," IRNA quoted an unnamed navy official as
saying.


Iran has defied international calls to free the 15 sailors it
seized in the northern Gulf on Friday for "illegal entry" into
its waters while Britain has presented documents which it says
shows they were in Iraqi waters.


"The coast guards have documented and filmed British forces
violating international law," the Iranian official said.


"Their entry and stay in our waters is certain according to the
information recorded on the British sailors' GPS."


Later on Thursday an Iranian army commander appeared on state TV
using maritime charts and a GPS "seized from the British
sailors".


"The information recorded on the GPS shows the sailors were
arrested in Iranian waters and that they had entered six times,"
said General Setareh, commander of coastal border patrols in
Arvand -- Iranian name for the Shatt al-Arab waterway between
Iran and Iraq where the sailors were arrested.
