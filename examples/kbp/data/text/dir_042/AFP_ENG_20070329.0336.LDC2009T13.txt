Iceland's central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
Thursday at 14.25 percent and said borrowing costs should be on
hold until the fourth quarter in the absence of price pressures.


"Inflation has slowed down and the inflation outlook has improved
since the central bank's previous forecast in November 2006," the
board of governors said in a statement.


The board added that under its "baseline forecast, all things
being equal, there will be no need to raise the policy rate
further and it will remain unchanged until the fourth quarter of
2007."


The bank's forecasting range is three years. At the end of that
period, it said, the benchmark rate should come down to 6.0
percent as inflation decreases.


Iceland is one of the most prosperous members of the 30-nation
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, with
growth averaging 4.0 percent a year in the past decade.


But the pace has sparked concerns in some quarters about
overheating.


The central bank raised its policy rate six times last year in
order to tame inflationary pressures. The rate-hiking cycle came
to an end in February 2007, when inflation in annual terms came
to 5.9 percent after 6.9 percent in December and 7.0 percent in
November.


The bank warned that its interest rate projections could be
altered "if indicators emerging in the coming months show that
demand, employment, the exchange rate and other major drivers of
inflation diverge from the current forecast ..."
