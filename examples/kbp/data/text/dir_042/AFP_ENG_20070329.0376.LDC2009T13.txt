Seven Ethiopian soldiers were killed in heavy fighting on
Thursday in the south of Mogadishu, and two of their bodies were
dragged through the streets, an AFP correspondent witnessed.


Dozens of men and women pulled the bodies of two soldiers in the
street, shouting "We will kill the Ethiopian troops", while five
other bodies in Ethiopian uniforms lay on the ground in the
southern district of Shirkole.


Nearby an Ethiopian military vehicle burned in the street.


Loudspeakers had earlier transmitted calls for residents to come
out and fight the Ethiopian troops backing Somalia's transitional
government.


The latest deaths brought the toll in Thursday's fighting to 22.


Meanwhile an AFP correspondent reported that a plane left
Mogadishu airport carrying around a dozen wounded Ethiopian
soldiers. The same plane had brought in around 60 soldiers on
Thursday morning, he said.


Ethiopian helicopters earlier fired missiles on mainly southern
Mogadishu as heavy fighting across the Somali capital left 15
people dead in an offensive against insurgent fighters.


The Ethiopians spearheaded the offensive, deploying tanks in
neighbourhoods that have witnessed the most intense insurgent
activity in recent months.
