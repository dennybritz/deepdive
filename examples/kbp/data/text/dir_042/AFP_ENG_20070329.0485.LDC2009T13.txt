The United States has no reason "to choose a confrontational
path" with Iran for the moment, US Under Secretary of State
Nicholas Burns said Thursday.


"There is no reason for us to choose a confrontational path now,"
Burns told Congress, amid rising tensions over Iran's detention
of 15 British naval personnel accused of entering Iranian waters.


"We believe diplomacy can succeed and we do not believe that
conflict with Iran is inevitable."


Asked about the affair of the detained British sailors and
marines, Burns remained cautious.


"Obviously all of us hope that Iran will make the right decision
and will release these people because they are entirely
innocent," he said, adding the group "were operating under UN
authority as part of a multinational coalition and were clearly
inside Iraqi waters."


He urged Americans to be patient saying that President George W.
Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice were using diplomacy
to try to resolve the crisis.


"For the diplomacy to succeed we are going to have to be patient
as well as persistent. We have some time to do that," Burns said.


"There is no reason for us to choose a confrontational path now.
We have time to pursue diplomacy and President Bush and Secretary
Rice are doing that."


US military maneuvers in the Gulf, a few days after the Britons
were seized on Friday, had raised fears of a military escalation
in the crisis, triggering a hike in oil prices.
