A special commemorative coin will be struck to next year to mark
Prince Charles' 60th birthday, finance minister Gordon Brown said
Thursday.


The new coin will be one of three to be issued in 2008.


Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown said Queen Elizabeth II had
approved his recommendation for crowns marking her eldest son and
heir's birthday and also the 450th anniversary of queen Elizabeth
I's accession.


Crowns in circulation are worth five pounds (9.85 dollars, 7.35
euros).


The third coin, worth two pounds, will celebrate the 100th
anniversary of the 1908 London Olympic Games, Brown said in a
statement.


The British capital, which also staged the 1948 Games, will host
the 2012 event.


"Collector versions of the coins will be released at a premium
above face value and, during the course of 2008, the coins will
also become available at face value from banks and post offices,"
Brown said.


This year's special five-pound coin celebrates the diamond
wedding anniversary of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.


There is also an Act of Union two-pound coin, celebrating 300
years of parliamentary union between England and Scotland, an
Abolition of the Slave Trade two-pound coin marking the 200th
anniversary, and a 50 pence piece marking 100 years of the Scout
Movement.
