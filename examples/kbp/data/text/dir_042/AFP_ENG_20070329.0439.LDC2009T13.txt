Retail group TJX has disclosed that some 45.6 million credit and
debit card numbers were stolen by hackers in 2005 and 2006, along
with other potentially sensitive customer information.


The company, which operates TJ Maxx and other stores in the
United States and TK Maxx in Britain and Ireland, also said some
455,000 customers may have had personal information compromised
in the massive data breach.


The retailer made the disclosure in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, expanding on its announcement earlier
this year.


It said a majority of the data may not be useful because it had
incomplete credit card numbers or were from cards that were
expired at the time of the breach between July 2005 and December
2006.


The company said it learned on December 18, 2006 of "suspicious
software" on its computer systems and later discovered "that
there was strong reason to believe that our computer systems had
been intruded upon."


The company subsequently notified law enforcement in the US,
Canada and Britain, and later determined that the intrusions may
have dated back as far as July 2005.


Several lawsuits are pending relating to what some have described
as the biggest financial data breach in history.
