Sri Lanka's economy grew by a better-than- expected 7.7 percent
last year despite a surge in fighting between troops and Tiger
separatist rebels, according to official figures on Thursday.


Agriculture, industry and services contributed to the growth, the
best since 1978, the Census and Statistics department said.


The economy grew by 6.2 percent in 2005.


"We are encouraged to see that all sectors performed well," said
Director General of Census and Statistics Suranjana Vidyaratne,
who had earlier forecast 2006 growth of 7.4 percent.


Heavy fighting between troops and Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) guerrillas erupted in December 2005 and official
figures show that at least 4,000 people have been killed since
then.


However, Vidyaratne's figures showed that the official inflation
rate jumped to 13.7 percent in 2006, up from 11.6 percent in
2005.


The year-on-year inflation rate hit 20.5 percent in January.


Central bank analysts have warned that the island's spiralling
ethnic conflict could affect growth in 2007.


The International Monetary Fund also warned that the "recent
escalation of hostilities could pose a risk to future economic
prospects."


Sri Lanka has increased its defence budget for 2007 by 45 percent
to 139 billion rupees (1.28 billion dollars), straining
government finances.
