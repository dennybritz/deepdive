New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and elected to
field against the West Indies in the World Cup Super Eights match
at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium here Thursday.


West Indies were playing for the third straight day after their
opening Super Eights match, a 103-run defeat by world champions
Australia, spanned Tuesday and Wednesday because of rain.


They made one change from that match, with Lendl Simmons in for
fast bowler Jerome Taylor whose 10 wicketless overs against
Australia cost 67 runs.


This was New Zealand's first Super Eights match.


The Black Caps were without batsman Lou Vincent who was forced
out of the World Cup on Sunday after having his wrist broken
batting in the nets against Kiwi fast bowler Shane Bond.


Peter Fulton moved up to open in his place alongside New Zealand
captain Stephen Fleming with Hamish Marshall drafted into the top
order barely two days after arriving in Antigua.


Group C winners New Zealand carried forward two points into the
second round after beating fellow qualifiers England.
