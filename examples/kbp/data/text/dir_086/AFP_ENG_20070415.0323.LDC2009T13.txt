German international Bastian Schweinsteiger is set to miss Bayern
Munich's clash with VfB Stuttgart which could decide which club
plays in next season's Champions League, Bayern revealed on
Sunday.


Fourth-placed Stuttgart host third-placed Bayern Munich at the
Gottlieb-Daimler Stadion on Saturday and the winner will be in
pole position to take the Budesliga's third Champions League
spot.


Bayern manager Uli Hoeness told reporters after Munich's 2-1 win
over Leverkusen on Sunday key Bayern midfielder Schweinsteiger,
22, has an infection in the knee injury he picked up a week ago
and now faces a longer lay-off.


"It looks like he has picked up an infection and he's doubtful
for our game with Stuttgart," confirmed Hoeness.
