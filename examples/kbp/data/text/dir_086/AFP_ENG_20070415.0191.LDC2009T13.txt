Kenia's Joshua Chelanga won the Rotterdam Marathon for
professional runners Sunday, but the race for amateurs was halted
due to unseasonably warm weather in the port city, the
organisation announced.


Chelanga finished in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 21 seconds in
temperatures of around 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees
Fahrenheit), unseasonable warm weather for April in the
Netherlands.


Later on Sunday the marathon organisers announced that they were
halting the amateur race because there were so many people
dropping out of the marathon due to the heat. Participants were
advised to walk to the finish line.


The ANP news agency reported that 14 runners had been
hospitalized after they fell ill due to the weather conditions.
Several runners suffered from dehydration, it added.


Last July one of the world's largest walking events - the
Vierdaagse of Nijmegen in the eastern Netherlands - was also
cancelled when two people succumbed to the heat.
