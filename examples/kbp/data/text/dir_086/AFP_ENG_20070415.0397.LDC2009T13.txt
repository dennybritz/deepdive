A new documentary television channel launched by the Qatar-based
Al-Jazeera network aims at fostering ties between different
peoples and cultures, director general Wadah Khanfar said Sunday.


Khanfar said the dedicated documentary channel, AJD, launched at
the beginning of the year will focus on major issues and less
well reported stories from both Arab speaking regions and
elsewhere.


This "will open a new window on the human experience, wherever it
might be," which "will provide another avenue for mutual
understanding between peoples and cultures," he told participants
attending an influential two-day documentary marketplace in
Cannes, MIPDOC, held on the eve of world's largest broadcasting
and audiovisual trade shows, MIPTV/MILIA.


There is a real need "to delve behind the story" in today's media
culture of immediacy where complex issues are often covered in a
very superficial way, Khanfar said.


"We are trying to give our Arab audiences a better understanding
and depth of major issues, he explained, adding that they were
"living in one of the most difficult zones of the world."


AJD is the latest addition to Al Jazeera's burgeoning stable of
TV channels that include an English-language news channel as well
as a children's channel.


These new additions, added to its widely-known Arabic news
channel, have built the network into a regional media powerhouse.
