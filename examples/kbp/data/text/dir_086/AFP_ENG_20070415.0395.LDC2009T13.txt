World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said Sunday "I intend to
continue" the global development lender's work on combatting
poverty despite being engulfed in a pay scandal.


"This is important work and I intend to continue it," he told a
news conference after talks among World Bank ministers who
expressed their "great concern" over the scandal.
