Ecuadorans overwhelmingly voted Sunday in favor of forming an
assembly to rewrite the constitution, a project sought by leftist
President Rafael Correa, according to a Cedatos-Gallup exit poll.


Correa's proposal garnered 78.1 percent of the votes, compared
with 11.5 percent cast in opposition, according to the company's
results broadcast by the television network Ecuavisa after the
polls closed.
