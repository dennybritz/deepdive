Two Palestinians were killed in clashes between rival families in
the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis on Sunday, witnesses
and medical sources said.


One member of each family was killed said the sources, who added
they were unable to provide further information.


Clan fights are a frequent occurrence in the lawless Gaza Strip
where clashes between supporters of the ruling Islamist Hamas
movement and the rival secular Fatah have dwindled since a unity
government deal was reached in March.


On Monday in Khan Yunis, three Palestinians were killed and seven
wounded in armed clashes between two families.


A street argument degenerated into a firefight after members of
two powerful families in the town intervened, the sources said.
The three dead were all aged under 27.
