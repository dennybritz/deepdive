Former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan will set up a
new international humanitarian agency in Geneva jointly with the
Swiss foreign ministry, a ministry spokesman said Sunday.


The ministry was working with a range of partners, both
institutions and individuals, but the agency would be headed by
Annan, said spokesman Johann Aeschlimann.


The 'NZZ am Sonntag' Sunday newspaper said the new agency would
act as a forum, holding a major international conference each
year as well as smaller meetings on specific themes.


Kofi Annan retired to Geneva upon stepping down as UN head at the
end of 2006.
