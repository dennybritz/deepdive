Croatia's Ivo Karlovic won his first ATP title here Sunday,
defeating qualifier Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina 6-4, 6-1 in the
final of the 416,000-dollar ATP US Clay Court Championship.


Karlovic's breakthrough title came in his third ATP finals
appearance. The Croatian lost to Britain's Andy Murray in the San
Jose final in February and dropped the 2005 Queen's final to
American Andy Roddick.


By taking the 65,850-dollar top prize, Karlovic denied the South
American's bid to become the first qualifier to win an ATP event
since Spain's Nicolas Almagro won last year at Valencia.


Zabaleta, ranked 156th in the world, upset US second seed James
Blake in the semi-finals and would have been the first qualifier
to capture this event since Chile's Fernando Gonzalez in 2000.


A knee injury kept Zabaleta, a three-time ATP tournament winner,
out most of last year and this season his ATP record entering the
event was only 1-3.
