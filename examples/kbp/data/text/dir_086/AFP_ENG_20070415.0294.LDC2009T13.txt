Belgrade prosecutors said Sunday they had opened an investigation
into three Kosovo Albanians suspected of committing war crimes in
1998, according to a statement quoted by the Beta news agency.


Sabit Gecaj, Hisen Muhalj and Sokolj Rama, former members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, are suspected of having illegally
arrested a Serbian police officer as he traveled by train in
Kosovo, Beta reported.


The officer, Ivan Bulatovic, was later killed and his body was
thrown into a well in the village of Gornje Obrinje.


Prosecutors have requested that Bulatovic's body be exhumed so an
autopsy can be performed. They have also called for the arrest of
the three suspects.


War crimes cases in Kosovo are currently handled by a court set
up by the United Nations, which will decide on the prosecutors'
request.


Kosovo, a Serbian province, has been administered by the UN since
1999, following NATO bombings aimed at halting the violent
Serbian crackdown on the ethnic-Albanian majority.


The UN chief mediator for Kosovo announced a plan last month that
would grant supervised independence for the province. Serbia and
Russia strongly oppose the plan, while Kosovo Albanians, the
United States and the European Union support it.
