Defending champion Nicolas Almagro defeated first-time ATP
finalist Potito Starace of Italy 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 in the final of
the 353,450-euro Valencia Open here on Sunday.


It was the third-seeded Spaniard's second career ATP title after
the 21-year-old clinched the Valencia title as a qualifier in
2006.


"Mom you didn't want to see me play again at the final, so I will
say thanks for your support through the television. I hope you
never come to see me again so I can keep on greeting you through
the television," he said at the end of the match.


Almagro, currently 31 in the world rankings, took his match
record to 14-8 this year.


He went into the match as the favourite after beating his 25
-year-old Italian opponent on a hard court in the second round of
ATP Masters Series in Miami last month.


Starace's best effort at an ATP tournament prior to this week
were two semifinal exits - one at Gstaad, Switzerland in 2004 and
the other at Sopot, Poland in 2005.
