The political bloc of firebrand Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr
will withdraw from the embattled Iraqi government on Monday, a
lawmaker from the group told AFP on Sunday.


"We will announce our withdrawal from the government tomorrow,"
MP Saleh Hassan Issa al-Igaili said, adding that the group will
however continue to participate in the parliament.


The Sadr group has six cabinet ministers in Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki's government and 32 lawmakers in the 275-member
parliament.
