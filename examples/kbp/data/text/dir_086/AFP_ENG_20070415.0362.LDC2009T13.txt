Finland's centrist party, fresh off a one-seat victory in last
month's legislative elections, has signed a governing pact with
conservatives, Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen announced Sunday.


The Centre Party's former coalition partner, the Social
Democrats, suffered a stinging setback in the March vote, leading
to a shift from a centre-left to a centre-right government.


The agreement announced Sunday, which includes tax reductions
demanded by conservatives, was also signed by the Greens and the
country's Swedish minority party.


The deal follows a week of negotiations between the four parties,
which will have a 125-seat majority in the 200-seat parliament.


They have set a goal of creating between 80,000 and 100,000 new
jobs by 2011 and reducing taxes by 1.8 billion euros (2.4 billion
dollars) over four years. Taxes on groceries, inheritance and
retirement earnings are to be reduced, while taxes on alcohol and
tobacco are to be increased.


Besides the prime minister post, the centrists will also have the
agriculture, transport and commerce portfolios, among others.


The conservatives get the foreign affairs, finance, defense and
other ministries.


Vanhanen is to be formally elected head of the government on
Tuesday.
