An officer with the African Union peacekeeping force was shot
dead in Al-Fasher in the war-torn Darfur region of Sudan, the
seventh killed this month, a mission spokesman said on Sunday.


"The officer was killed by shots from unknown gunmen near the
entrance to the headquarters of the African force in Al-Fasher
(capital of North Darfur state) and his vehicle was stolen,"
Nourredine Mezni told AFP.


The nationality of the officer was not disclosed.


On Tuesday, a Rwandan peacekeeper was shot dead and two others
wounded, also in North Darfur.


The bloodiest attack on the 7,000-strong force came on April 1
when five Senegalese soldiers guarding a Darfur watering station
were shot dead, an incident blamed by Khartoum on the rebel
Sudanese Liberation Army.


The deaths prompted the Senegalese government on Thursday to warn
that it might pull out its 500-strong contingent if the African
Union could not guarantee its soldiers' safety.


The Arab League on Sunday issued a condemnation of these
"criminal attacks against the African Union" and emphasised the
"necessity of punishing the perpetrators."


Sudan has come under growing international pressure to accept a
plan put forward by former UN chief Kofi Annan to beef up the AU
peacekeeping force in Darfur with UN forces.


But Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir has repeatedly rejected the
plan, accusing the West of harbouring neo-colonial ambitions.


The ill-equipped AU contingent has failed to stem the violence
and 17 of its troops have been killed there since 2004.


Four years of civil war in Darfur have killed at least 200,000
people and displaced more than two million, according to United
Nations figures.
