Egyptian Police on Sunday arrested 15 students belonging to the
banned opposition Muslim Brotherhood at a university north of
Cairo on charges of planning to hold a secret meeting, a security
source said.


Police surrounded the campus of Menufiyah university, about 60
kilometres (40 miles) north of the capital, and detained the
student activists, the source told AFP, adding that the number of
arrests was expected to rise.


According to the group's website, the entire university is under
siege with security forces disrupting an artistic festival
organised by Islamist students.


"Students are being stopped and searched at university entrances
and their phones, computers and books are being confiscated," the
website said.


The Brotherhood is the largest and best organised opposition
movement in the country but it is also officially banned leaving
it open to periodic crackdowns.


The group holds one fifth of the seats in parliament after
fielding candidates as independents in the November-December 2005
legislative elections.


On Saturday police announced the arrest of 14 Brotherhood student
activists at another Cairo university, as well as three leading
members for organising a military-style parade.
