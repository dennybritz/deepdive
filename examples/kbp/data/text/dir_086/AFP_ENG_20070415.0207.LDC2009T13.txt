British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Sunday urged people to leave
Prince William and Kate Middleton alone to get on with their
lives following their break-up.


Blair said most of the stories written about the end of their
four-year relationship, when many had thought they were set for
marriage, would be "complete nonsense".


"I think, in respect of Prince William, they are a young couple.
We have had the announcement, fine," he told BBC television --
though Clarence House, the royal residence which handles the
prince's affairs, has refused to confirm or deny the widely-
reported split.


"They should be left alone now without reams of stuff being
written that I can assure you, from my experience of royal
stories, most of which will be complete nonsense.


"I think, now it has been announced, they should be allowed to
get on with their lives."


Blair said that most public figures accepted there would be some
level of media interest in their private lives because that was
"the way it is".


"My experience of it actually is that what concerns people is not
so much the invasion of their privacy as such, because I think
most people in public life accept that you are bound to be a
public issue and item in that sense," he said.


"I think it is more that usually whatever is discussed about you
publicly is surrounded by a whole lot of other stuff that is
either unfair or sometimes completely untrue and that is the
thing that really gets people down."
