AC Milan won 3-1 at Messina on Sunday to climb into fourth spot
in the Italian league to continue their late season charge
following qualification for the Champions League semi-finals.


Coach Carlo Ancelotti has said all along this season that fourth
spot, and a place in the Champions League next season, was his
team's aim although they started with an eight-point deficit for
their involvement in the match-fixing scandal.


Kaka and Giuseppe Favalli put Milan two goals ahead in the first
half hour and Ronaldo scored a third near the end though
Messina's Salvatore Masiello found the net in injury time.


Palermo could reclaim fourth spot should they win Sunday's late
match but they will have work to do at unbeaten runaway leaders
Inter Milan who have won 25 out of their 30 matches.


AC Milan's victory comes just four days after their 2-0 victory
at Bayern Munich which put them into the Champions League semi-
finals 4-2 on aggregate.


Second-placed AS Roma also had a big victory with Francesco Totti
scoring twice in a 4-0 thrashing of Sampdoria following their
Champions League humiliation. Totti confirmed his place as league
top scorer with 20 goals.


Roma lost 7-1 to Manchester United in their quarter-final, second
leg at Old Trafford on Tuesday.


Roma's city rivals Lazio however could only draw 2-2 at bottom
club Ascoli to end their run of eight consecutive victories.
