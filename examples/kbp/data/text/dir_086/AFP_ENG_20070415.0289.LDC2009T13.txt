Swedish aviation authorities on Sunday harshly criticised
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for not carrying out safety
checks on its planes on time.


"We are critical," Gunnar Billinger, the head of the Swedish
Civil Aviation Authority, told AFP, adding that SAS' late safety
checks were considered "serious".


"All airlines... must carry out controls at set times," he
insisted.


Five SAS planes last year and three in 2005 did not undergo the
required safety inspections on time, Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter
reported.


The aircraft in question were Airbus A330 and A340, which are
used for longhaul flights to the United States and to Asia,
according to the paper.


In one case last year, a plane flew 225 hours, the equivalent of
30 longhaul flights, without first being found airworthy, Dagens
Nyheter reported.


For a plane to be considered airworthy, safety checks must be
carried out at specific dates and the aircraft must be found to
conform with guidelines set by the country where it was made,
which in the case of the Airbus planes is France.


Aircraft that are not certified airworthy are banned from flying.
Any flights they carry out are considered illegal, another
aviation authority official told Dagens Nyheter.


Billinger meanwhile said SAS "remains a safe company", pointing
out that the Scandinavian airline had itself notified the
authorities to the safety lapses.
