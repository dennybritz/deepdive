A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit off the Indonesia's island of
Ternate in Northern Maluku province on Sunday,  geologists said.


The quake struck at 6:42 pm (1042 GMT) and was centred 44
kilometres (27 miles) under the seabed some 126 kilometres (78.12
miles) northwest of Ternate, said an official from Indonesia's
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency.


There were no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire"
where continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and
volcanic activity.


Indonesia was the nation worst hit by the earthquake-triggered
Asian tsunami in December 2004, which killed some 168,000 people
in Aceh province alone.
