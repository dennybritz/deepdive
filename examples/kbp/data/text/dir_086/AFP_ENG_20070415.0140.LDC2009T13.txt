At least 21 people were killed during Saturday's state
governorship and parliamentary polls across Nigeria, a top police
officer said Sunday.


"We have about 21 persons killed, including some police officers,
while trying to protect INEC (Independent National Electoral
Commission) officers," Inspector General Sunday Ehindero told
Radio Nigeria.


"Of course we have some wounded too -- about 14. We have some
arms recovered. We have about 218 suspects arrested," he added.
