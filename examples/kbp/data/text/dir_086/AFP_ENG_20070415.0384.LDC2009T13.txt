France rugby captain Fabien Pelous returned to action for the
first time in four months here on Sunday when he came on as a
second-half replacement for his club Toulouse in their 24-7 Top
14 win over Clermont.


The 33-year-old had been out with a badly twisted left ankle he
suffered in the European Cup match with Llanelli on December 16
and had been forced to sit out the Six Nations tournament which
France won.


"Well that's over!" said Pelous, who has been capped 111 times
and is within one of equalling centre Philippe Sella's national
record.


"I hope I will have a little more time on the pitch next time,"
added Pelous, who came on in the 74th minute.


"I was a little bit apprehensive with regards to the rhythm of
the match, but I didn't have time to breathe!" he joked.


"One always wants more, that's normal.


"That is almost four months since I last played a major match, I
was bursting to get back."


The return of Pelous, who is desperate to prove his fitness so he
can play in the World Cup being hosted by France in September and
October, is another boost for Toulouse, who last week welcomed
back France's mercurially talented fly-half Frederic Michalak,
although he was missing against Clermont because of a calf
problem.
