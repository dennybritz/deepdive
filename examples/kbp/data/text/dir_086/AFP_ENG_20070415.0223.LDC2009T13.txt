Senegal midfielder Khalilou Fadiga faces a fight to save his
career after he ruptured an Achilles tendon playing for English
Championship club Coventry.


Fadiga, a former Inter Milan and Auxerre player, suffered the
injury late in Coventry's 4-0 home defeat against Preston on
Saturday and his club's manager Iain Dowie admitted it is a
career-threatening problem.


"For a lad of his standing in the game, and his age, it is a
massive blow," Dowie said.


"He has had a tough time of it. His Mum died recently but he got
back and got his fitness up. Whether he can come back from it,
who knows?"
