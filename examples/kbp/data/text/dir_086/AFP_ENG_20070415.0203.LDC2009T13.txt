Algerian authorities have identified two suicide bombers who blew
themselves up in an attack on a police station outside the
capital this week, the interior minister said Sunday.


Noureddine Zerhouni did not name the bombers, who exploded two
separate car bombs on the road to the Algiers international
airport on Wednesday.


Minutes earlier, another car bomb attack had ripped the facade of
the building housing the prime minister's office in central
Algiers.


"The battle against terrorism has not stopped," the minister
said, adding that Algeria must "maintain vigilence as well as
pressure on terrorist groups".


The bomber in the first attack was earlier identified as Merouane
Boudina, 28, also known as Mouaad Ben Jabal, who was from a poor
Algiers suburb.


The blasts killed 33 people and injured more than 200. Some 21
victims remained hospitalised.


The bombings were claimed by Al-Qaeda's branch in North Africa,
formerly known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat
(GSPC), which published photographs of what it said were the
three bombers on the Internet.
