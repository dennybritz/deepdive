The Nigerian police on Sunday banned any form of demonstration or
procession in support of or in protest against the results of
Saturday's governorship and parliamentary polls.


"The next stage in this election is the announcement of results,"
said national police boss Sunday Ehindero.


"There should be no form of procession. No form of demonstration
will be tolerated at this stage, at least in the next 48 hours,"
he added.


"We have avenues where grievances can be made. You can petition
either INEC (Independent National Electoral Commission) or the
election tribunals," he told Radio Nigeria. He advised law-
abiding citizens to make use of those avenues.


At least 21 people were killed during Saturday's state
governorship and parliamentary polls across Nigeria, Ehindero
said earlier Sunday.


"We have about 21 persons killed including some police officers
while trying to protect INEC (Independent National Electoral
Commission) officers.


"Of course we have some wounded too -- about 14. We have some
arms recovered. We have about 218 suspects arrested," he added.


He made the statement as the INEC began to announce results of
the polls received from some states.


Of the six states -- Ogun, Ekiti, Osun, Borno, Delta and Abia --
where the complete results are ready, the ruling Peoples
Democratic Party (PDP) won in four while opposition parties won
in two others.


"Collation of results is still going in most of the states," INEC
national spokesman Phillip Umeadi said on a live television
programme.
