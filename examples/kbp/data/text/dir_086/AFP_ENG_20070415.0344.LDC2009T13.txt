Bangladesh were 45-1 after 10 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against Ireland at Kensington Oval here on Sunday
chasing 244 to win.


Tamim Iqbal was on 13 with Aftab Ahmed on 12.


Struggling opener Shahriar Nafees was the first man out caught
behind by Niall O'Brien off Boyd Rankin for seven with the total
on 18 in the seventh over.


Earlier, opener William Porterfield hit a solid 85 to help
Ireland post a healthy 243-7.


Ireland, who are bidding to avoid last place after losing four
second round matches, saw Porterfield give them a confident start
of 92 with Jeremy Bray (31) after skipper Trent Johnston won the
toss and decided to bat.


Kevin O'Brien, who made 48 off just 44 balls with two sixes and
as many fours, took Ireland past the 200-mark and gave the
innings much-needed impetus during a 39-run fifth wicket stand
with Johnston who made 30.
