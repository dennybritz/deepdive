England batsman Kevin Pietersen insists his bitter feud with
South Africa captain Graeme Smith will not distract him from his
mission of trying to secure a World Cup semi-final place.


If South Africa win Tuesday's Super Eights clash then they will
be guaranteed the final last four spot and England will be out.


Pietersen, who was born in South Africa but switched allegiance
after becoming frustrated at the lack of opportunities, has waged
a war of words with Smith since returning to the country of his
birth on tour in 2005.


Pietersen called Smith an "absolute muppet" for his on-field
sledging during that tour.


"Graeme Smith and I do not get on but I must not be distracted,"
the 26-year-old Pietersen told the News of the World on Sunday.


"This is a massive game. It's a make-or-break game. If we win,
we've a great chance of making the semi-finals. If we lose, we'll
be flying out of the Caribbean on Sunday.


"Tuesday is do or die for England. It's not Kevin Pietersen v
Graeme Smith.


"We won't be having a beer together afterwards. Neither of us
have a problem with that. We will both be giving everything to
come out on top - let's leave it at that."


Pietersen left South Africa in protest at the quota system which
guarantees places in the international set-up for black players.


But he insists that the issue is history.


"The reality is that I am bored with the South Africa issue. It's
old news. All my reasons for leaving have been well-documented,"
said Pietersen.
