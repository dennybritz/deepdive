Serbian second seed Jelena Jankovic battled through brisk winds
to defeat Russian fourth seed Dinara Safina 6-2, 6-2 here Sunday
in the final of a WTA clay court tournament.


Calling them the toughest conditions she had ever played in,
Jankovic rose to 28-8 on the season and will jump from ninth to
seventh in the WTA rankings after capturing the 196,900-dollar
top prize at the 1.34 million-dollar event.


"It was really tough. It was really windy. Balls were flying all
over the place," Jankovic said. "I was just trying to put as many
balls in the court as I could. We were both fighting. I'm really
happy."


Despite the high winds, Jankovic missed only one first serve in
the first set, surrendering her serve once but breaking Safina
three times to dominate.


Safina, who fell to 20-8 for the season, took a 2-0 lead in the
second set when Jankovic netted a backhand volley to surrender a
break in the second game.


But Jankovic did not lose another game, breaking Safina three
times and holding in the final game when Safina mishit a forehand
on the Serbian's second match point.


Jankovic had struggled here previously, unable to move past the
second round in four prior appearances.
