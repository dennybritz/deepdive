The archbishop of Florence, cardinal Ennio Antonelli, admitted in
a letter published Sunday to covertly handling the case of a
priest accused of sexually abusing girls and women.


Antonelli said the priest, Lelio Cantini, had "admitted to having
sexual relations with young women between 1973 and 1987,"
according to a letter published in the media.


The archbishop said that he had decided in the summer of 2005 to
strip Cantini of any ecclesiastical role, but had determined to
take a harder line after meeting with some of the priest's
victims.


The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees
Catholic doctrine, had "as is often the norm in serious and clear
cases, authorised a trial," he said.


The errant priest, who is now in his eighties, can no longer hold
mass, hear confessions or assume any church function for five
years, Antonelli said.


"I have read reproaches in the media because the affair was not
dealt with in public," he wrote. "I do not believe this is an
evangelical way of treating people, no matter how grave their
sin."


Italy's La Repubblica newspaper last Sunday accused the church of
hushing up the affair and said some of the priests victims were
young girls.
