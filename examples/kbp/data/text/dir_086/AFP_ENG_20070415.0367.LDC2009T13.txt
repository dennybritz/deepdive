Russia will build eight nuclear submarines armed with Bulava
intercontinental missiles by 2017, junior Defence Minister Alexi
Moskovski said Sunday as the first of them was launched.


"Seven submarines of the Borei (type 955) will be built and
launched by the navy between now and 2015. The eighth will be
received in 2017," the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.


The Yuri Dolgoruky submarine, launched at the northwestern naval
base of Severodvinsk, is the first strategic nuclear submarine
built in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.


The Bulava missiles can carry 10 nuclear warheads with a range of
up to 8,000 kilometres (5,000 miles).
