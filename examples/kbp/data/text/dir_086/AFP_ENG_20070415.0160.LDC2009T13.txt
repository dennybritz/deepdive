Pope Benedict XVI marked his 80th birthday Sunday with a mass
before thousands of worshippers in which he spoke of "darkness"
threatening the world in the form of war, oppression and hate.


The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who turns 80 on Monday, was
elected to succeed John Paul II two years ago Thursday and the
mass in St Peter's Square celebrated both milestones.


He said only the grace of God could defeat evil in the world.


"Let us ask that this gift of God be accorded above all to the
nations where oppression, hate and the tragedy of war hold sway,"
he said.


The pope paid tribute to his predecessor, saying John Paul had
lived through dictatorships, poverty and violence and had
"profound experience of the darkness which also threatens the
world of our time."


Pilgrims had been called to attend the mass to "thank God for the
gift he has given us in our Pope Benedict XVI."


The conservative Benedict, though less warm and spontaneous than
his predecessor, has drawn similar-sized crowds so far in his
young papacy, according to Vatican figures, though the numbers
are falling.
