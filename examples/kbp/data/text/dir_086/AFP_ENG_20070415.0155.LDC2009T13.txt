Voting began in Ecuador early Sunday, with thousands of citizens
headed to polling stations to decide whether to launch a broad
constitutional reform process sought by leftist President Rafael
Correa.


More than 9.2 million eligible voters will decide whether a
national assembly should be elected to rewrite the constitution.


Balloting began throughout the country at 7:00 am (1200 GMT), as
scheduled.


Opinion polls taken before the referendum suggested 66 percent of
Ecuadorans planned to vote in favor of Correa's reform proposal,
while 15 percent opposed it.
