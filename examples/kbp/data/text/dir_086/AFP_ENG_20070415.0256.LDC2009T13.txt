Marat Safin carried his clay-court momentum from last weekend's
Davis Cup victory into the opening round of the Monte Carlo
Masters as he ousted Finn Jarkko Nieminen 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 on
Sunday.


The former world number one from Russia was joined in the second
round by Frenchman Julien Benneteau a 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 winner over
Benjamin Balleret in a local first-round derby.


Last Sunday, Safin came on in the crunch tie to save Russia's
hopes in the Davis Cup, earning the winning point over France to
send the holders into the semi- finals of the worldwide team
competition.


The world number 27 is making progress in his rise back up the
rankings after nursing a knee injury in recent seasons.


The start was a poor one for Finland's 15th-seeded Nieminin, who
was beaten in the first round here a year ago. He stands 2-5
against the Russian.


The 20th-ranked Finn began by lifting a combatative opening set
as he broke Safin on the Russian's last three service games.


But Safin showed the bravery of a double Grand Slam winner as he
fought back to snatch the second and began the third with a break
which proved to be decisive.


Sunday's opening day was lightly scheduled, with only four main
draw singles on tap.


The top eight seeds, led by Roger Federer and defending champion
Rafael Nadal go into action after first-round byes.


Two-time Roland Garros champion Nadal is defending a swag of
points after lifting 2006 titles on his favourite surface at
Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Rome and Paris.
