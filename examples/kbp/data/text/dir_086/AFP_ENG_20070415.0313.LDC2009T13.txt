A senior Islamic cleric is taking a writer and a culture magazine
editor to court for offending Islam after writing a poem
comparing God to a "traffic policeman," a judicial source said
Sunday.


Sheikh Yussef al-Badri, of the government Supreme Council for
Islamic Affairs, together with 18 other plaintiffs, is suing poet
Helmy Salem and Ahmed Higazi, the editor-in-chief of the culture
publication Al-Ibdaa, for "blasphemy" and "offending the divine
being."


The plaintiffs complained of the "insolence of the writer to
portray God as a traffic policeman."
