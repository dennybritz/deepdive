Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif on Sunday allocated 240
million pounds (42 million dollars) to the ministries of health
and agriculture to help combat bird flu, the official MENA news
agency said.


The highly pathogenic virus has killed 14 people out of 34 cases
reported since the disease was first diagnosed in Egypt in
February last year.


The new budget will help "improve veterinary laboratories,
provide the necessary equipment and preparation for immunising
the birds, and for the training of 1,200 veterinary doctors,"
Ayman Alkaffas, spokesman for the Supreme National Committee to
Combat Bird Flu, was quoted by MENA as saying.


Egypt's geographocal location on major bird migration routes and
the widespread practice of keeping domestic fowl near living
quarters have led to it being the hardest-hit country outside of
Asia.


"The wrong attitude of people is one of the biggest impediments
to combatting the spread of the virus in homes," Alkaffas said.


"The fact that children are found in the areas where poultry are
raised is another reason for the fast spread of the disease," he
added.
