A bus bomb exploded in a shopping district of central Baghdad on
Sunday, killing at least 11 people and bringing the daily toll in
such attacks to 35, defence and security sources said.


A further 18 civilians were wounded in the blast.


The powerful explosion ripped through the Karrada neighbourhood
on the first day of Iraq's working week, the latest in a series
of insurgent attacks mounted around the country in defiance of a
two-month-old security plan.
