Bangaldesh's left-arm paceman Syed Rasel sprained his ankle a few
minutes before the start of the World Cup match against Ireland
at Kensington Oval on Sunday, a team official said.


"We had to change the team at the last minute due to a freak
injury to Rasel. The preliminary inspection suggest Rasel has
sprained his right ankle and hopefully he will be back for the
next match," Bangladesh media manager Rabeed Imam told AFP.


Rasel, 21, took two wickets in Bangladesh's four wicket defeat
against England on Wednesday, taking his overall tally in seven
matches to eight.


His place was taken by right-arm paceman Shahadat Hossain.


"Rasel is a big loss in a crucial match but we hope that some
rest will heal his injury and he will be back soon," said Imam.


Bangladesh's last Super Eights match is against the West Indies
here on Thursday.


They beat India in the preliminary round to progress to the
second round for the first time since making their World Cup
debut in 1999. They also upset South Africa in the Super Eights
to raise outside hopes of a semi-final place.
