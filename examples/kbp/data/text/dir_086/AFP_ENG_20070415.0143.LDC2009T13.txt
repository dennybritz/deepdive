Power was slowly being restored in Sri Lanka after the nation's
entire electricity supply was abruptly cut Sunday for around two
hours, with authorities yet to determine the cause, officials
said.


The whole island was without electricity from the national grid,
said a spokesman for the Ceylon Electricity Board, the state-run
body that oversees most electricity generation in the country.


It was "an island-wide power failure," the spokesman said. "We
are trying to restore supplies and we have not been able to
identify what caused the entire system to trip."


Two hours after the failure, electricity supplies had been
restored in some areas, but it would be a few hours before the
entire island could be reconnected, an official said.


There was a similar nationwide blackout in November, shortly
after the finance ministry said the country needed to invest in
more electricity generation and a better distribution network.
