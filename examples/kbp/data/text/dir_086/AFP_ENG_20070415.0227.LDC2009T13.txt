Kenya's Joshua Chelanga won the Rotterdam marathon on Sunday
ahead of Japan's Takayuki Matsumyia and another Kenyan William
Kipsang.


Chelanga clocked 2hr 8min 21sec which was well outside the
2:06.14 of compatriot Felix Limo set in the Dutch city in 2004.
Matsumyia timed 2:10.09 and Kipsang managed 2:11.03.
