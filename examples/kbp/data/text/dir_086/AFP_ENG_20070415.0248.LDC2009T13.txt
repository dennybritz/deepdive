Forest fires broke out in southern and western Germany at the
weekend as summer weather set in over most of the country, local
authorities said on Sunday.


In the southern state of Bavaria, a fire raged for two days near
Lake Thumsee while firemen also battled smaller blazes in forests
outside Munich.


Some 60 hectares (148 acres) of forest on Lake Thumsee in the
area of Bad Reichenhall caught fire on Friday.


Three hundred firemen and volunteers, helped by 20 soldiers using
helicopters to douse the flames, brought the fire under control
by late Saturday.


On Sunday, there was still a danger it could flare again, said
Stefan Neiber, a spokesman for local authorities.


"The risk of fire remains high," he said.


Police said they did not suspect arson and blamed the weather and
dry soil and vegetation for the fires.


In Muehlheim in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia,
several thousand square metres of scrub land caught fire on
Saturday evening. The blaze was extinguished before it could
threaten houses.


Temperatures hovered between 23 and 28 degrees Celsius (101 and
113 degrees Fahrenheit) across most of Germany on Sunday, but in
Cologne in the west of the country the mercury hit a record 30.6
degrees Celsius.


Meteorologist Michael Beisenherz said the warm temperatures were
exceptional, adding that the last time Germany had experienced
such heat in April was in 1968, when the eastern state of Saxony-
Anhalt measured 32 degrees Celsius.


"At this time of the year we are used to around 14 degrees
Celsius during the day," he said.


Temperatures were expected to cool down during the week.
