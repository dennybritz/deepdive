Three more US troops have been killed in Iraq, the military
reported Sunday, taking its losses to 42 in April alone.


A soldier was killed in small arms fire in a southern area of
Baghdad on Sunday, the military said.


His unit was responding to an Iraqi police patrol which came
under attack near a local mosque, it said, adding that a civilian
was wounded in the attack.


Two marines were killed Saturday, one in a roadside bomb
explosion south of Baghdad and another in a combat operation in
the restive Sunni Anbar province, the military said.


The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,296, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
