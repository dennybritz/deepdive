Management and workers at the Czech Republic's largest auto
maker, Skoda, will hold talks on Monday in a bid to avoid a
strike set to begin the next day, a company official said.


"We are ready to negotiate," Martin Jahn, a member of the Skoda
board, said Sunday on CT 1 public television. He added, however,
that management would likely not be able to persuade workers to
abandon the strike, which is scheduled to begin Tuesday.


Last week, unions refused a management offer of 10 percent base
salary increases and other bonuses that would result in total
raises of 13 percent over the period of April 2007 to April 2009.


After unions announced the decision to strike, management reduced
the proposed 10 percent raises to 7.5 percent.


The average salary for Skoda Auto workers is 22,057 koruna (789
euros, 1,100 dollars), according to unions. Based in Mlada
Boleslav, about 55 kilometres (35 miles) northeast of Prague,
Skoda Auto employs some 26,000 employees.


The company, part of the Volkswagen Group, earned record net
profits of 11.06 billion koruna (392 million euros, 530 million
dollars) last year, an increase of 40 percent over the previous
year. It is the Czech Republic's largest exporter, responsible
for 7.7 percent of total sales abroad last year.
