Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Sunday appeared in
public for the first time since two suicide bomb attacks on the
government headquarters and a police station in Algiers killed 33
people.


Bouteflika began a tour of inspection of the Algiers region,
which included opening a new medical complex at Dely-Brahim in
the hills overlooking the capital.


Later he was to open a new court building in a bustling
neighbourhood of Algiers before visiting the bedside of wounded
victims in Wednesday's attacks at the Mustapha central hospital.


Of the 222 people injured in the bomb attacks, 21 were still in
hospital on Sunday.


Responsibility for the attacks were claimed by Al-Qaeda's branch
in North Africa, formerly known as the Salafist Group for
Preaching and Bombat (GSPC).


The authorities have said they do not believe there is a
connection with the spate of suicide bombings in Casablanca in
neighbouring Morocco.
