Indian troops shot dead four  suspected Islamic militants in
revolt-hit Indian Kashmir, police said Sunday, while a Muslim man
was also beheaded in further violence.


Two of the rebels were killed in a clash Sunday with troops near
Shopian, 55 kilometres (34 miles) south of the summer capital,
Srinagar, police said, adding the two were members of the
region's most powerful rebel group, Hizbul Mujahedin.


Two other militants were shot dead Sunday in a similar clash with
troops and police in a district south of Shopian, a police
spokesman said.


Police said suspected militants beheaded a Muslim man in the
Pulwama district, where Shopian is located, early Sunday.


The motive for the killing was not immediately known, although
militants regularly target people suspected of working with
police and troops.


More than 42,000 people have died in Kashmir by official count
since rebels launched a bloody insurgency against Indian rule in
1989.


Human rights groups put the death toll at 70,000.


Indian police are probing five cases in which innocent civilians
were allegedly killed and passed off as militants that came to
light in early 2007.


Police have charged 17 security force and police members with
murder in two of the cases.
