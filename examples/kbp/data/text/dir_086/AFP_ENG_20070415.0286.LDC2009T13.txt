Egypt has beefed up security, especially in tourist areas, after
Algeria and Morocco were rocked by a string of suicide bomb
attacks, a security source said Sunday.


The source told AFP that Interior Minister Habib al-Adly had
instructed his top aides on Saturday to "accurately carry out
security plans" and to "secure tourist areas."


"Intense security efforts are underway to abort any potential
extremist hotbeds, and attempts by organisations to revive their
activities," the source quoted the minister as saying.


"According to our security assessment, a wave of terrorist
attacks is expected in the region, and our security measures are
concentrating on this," Adly said.


A spate of bombings in the region, claimed by an Al-Qaeda group,
have sparked fears of increased militant strikes across North
Africa.


Five suicide bombers have killed themselves in the Moroccan port
city of Casablanca in five days. In Algiers, 33 people were
killed after a string of coordinated suicide bomb attacks.


Egypt was itself a target of deadly attacks in the Sinai
peninsula between 2004 and 2006.


At least 34 people were killed in triple bombings in and around
the resort of Taba on Egypt's Red Sea coast near the Israeli
border in October, 2004.


Egypt said a group calling itself Al-Tawhid wal Jihad carried out
the attacks, and was also responsible for the July 2005 bombings
in Sharm al-Sheikh which killed about 70 people, and a triple
suicide attack in April 2006 which killed 20 people in Sinai's
popular Dahab resort.
