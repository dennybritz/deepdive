Jose Mourinho hinted at a thaw in his troubled relationship with
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by revealing that the Russian
billionaire had given him a hug after watching his side beat
Blackburn in the FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford on Sunday.


The two men had reportedly not spoken for months prior to the
match and Mourinho has been widely tipped to leave Stamford
Bridge this summer, even though the club remains in the hunt for
a clean sweep of all four trophies they have entered.


But suggestions their relationship has broken down irretrievably
appeared at odds with Mourinho's account of their meeting after
Sunday's match.


"I spoke to him just here (next to the press conference room),"
Mourinho said. "Sure we had a hug. I told him congratulations and
he told me congratulations."
