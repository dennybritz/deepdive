Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert have agreed to hold their next meeting in the West
Bank town of Jericho, a senior official said on Sunday.


"We have agreed on a meeting before the end of the month in
Jericho," chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat told reporters
in Ramallah following a meeting of the two leaders in Jerusalem
on Sunday.


Abbas and Olmert last month agreed to meet every two weeks with
the aim of jumpstarting the peace process, largely dormant for
six years.
