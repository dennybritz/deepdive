England have dismissed fears that all-rounder Andrew Flintoff is
suffering from glandular fever and could be a doubt for Tuesday's
make-or-break World Cup clash against South Africa.


Flintoff, 29, has been suffering from a chest infection recently
but tests for glandular fever proved negative.


"Freddie is fine and has taken a full part in practice," a team
spokesman told the BBC.


"He had a respiratory infection for several days in Antigua."
