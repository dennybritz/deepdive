The US government warned Sunday of a high risk of violence
against US citizens in the Moroccan port city of Casablanca after
a spate of suicide bombings.


The warning came a day after two brothers blew themselves up near
the US consulate here. Five suicide bombers have killed
themselves in Casablanca in five days.


"The potential for violence against American interests and
citizens and other Western targets remains high in Morocco," the
US consulate in Casablanca said in a statement.


"Moroccan authorities continue to disrupt groups seeking to
attack US- or Western-affiliated targets and arrest individuals
associated with international terrorist groups.


"Establishments which are readily identifiable with the United
States are potential targets for attacks. These may include
facilities where US citizens and other foreigners congregate,
including clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels,
movie theaters and other public areas."


It said US government personnel in Casablanca were advised to
"remain at home."


"American citizens are urged to remain alert to local security
developments and be vigilant regarding their personal security,"
it said.


Events in Morocco alongside coordinated suicide bomb attacks in
Algiers on Wednesday, which killed 33 and were claimed by an Al-
Qaeda group, have fuelled fears of increased militant strikes
across North Africa.
