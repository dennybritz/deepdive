A leader of far-left opposition group The Other Russia, Eduard
Limonov, was released Sunday in Saint Petersburg, hours after
police detained him following a protest, his spokesman said.


Limonov "was released at around 10:30 pm (1830 GMT)," Alexander
Averin told AFP.


He said Limonov had been accused of organising an illegal
demonstration and of not obeying police, and had been ordered to
attend a hearing at a Saint Petersburg court on April 26. He
faces up to 15 days behind bars.
