Alan Johnston, the kidnapped BBC Gaza correspondent, was one of
the few Western reporters brave enough to live in the
increasingly lawless Palestinian territory.


The reporter, 44, was forced from his car at gunpoint as he drove
home from work in Gaza City on March 12 and became the Westerner
held for the longest time in the Gaza Strip.


Johnston, who had held a variety of international news posts at
the British Broadcasting Corporation, was just weeks away from
finishing his posting there and returning to London.


The shaven-headed Alan Graham Johnston, who was single, was born
in the coastal town of Lindi, Tanzania, on May 17, 1962.


He was educated at Dollar Academy in the small town of Dollar in
central Scotland, and earned a master of arts postgraduate degree
in English and Politics from the nearby University of Dundee and
a diploma in Journalism Studies from the University of Wales in
Cardiff.


He joined the BBC in January 1991 as a sub-editor in the BBC
World Service newsroom before becoming the corporation's Tashkent
correspondent from 1993 to 1995. He also served as the BBC's
Kabul correspondent from 1997 to 1998.


He returned to London and the BBC World Service to be a programme
editor of The World Today and then a general reporter in the BBC
World Service newsroom.


His three-year posting to Gaza began in April 2004, where he
worked for all BBC outlets in both radio and television.


Many journalists left the Gaza Strip last year as fighting
between rival Hamas and Fatah political factions intensified.
