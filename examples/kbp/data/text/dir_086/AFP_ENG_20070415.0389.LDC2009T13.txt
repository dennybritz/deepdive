Final-round play in the US PGA Verizon Heritage tournament was
suspended here Sunday because of high winds.


Heavy gusts on the concluding holes along the water swept balls
from their positions and broke limbs off trees, prompting
officials to halt play just after the final group had reached the
first green.


Jerry Kelly remained in the lead at 13-under par, one stroke
ahead of his playing partners in the last round, fellow American
Kevin Na and South African Ernie Els.


Play was expected to resume later Sunday but it was uncertain if
conditions would allow for a weekend finish at the first
tournament following the year's first major championship.


American Zach Johnson was the surprise winner of the Masters a
week ago in Augusta, Georgia. Johnson shared fifth, four strokes
off the pace, after completing the first hole of his final round.
