Ben Gordon scored 30 points and Luol Deng added 16 to lead the
Chicago Bulls in a 101-68 rout of Washington here Sunday that
boosted Chicago's hopes of a 50-win season and a number two
playoff seed.


The Bulls improved to 49-32 ahead of their season-ending game
Wednesday at New Jersey, when they could reach 50 wins for the
first time since Michael Jordan's last National Basketball
Association playoff title in 1998.


"It would mean a lot," Bulls veteran Ben Wallace said. "Fifty
wins is not something you just walk on the floor and get."


While the Detroit Pistons have already won 51 games and clinched
the Central Division crown, the Bulls are battling Cleveland,
48-32, for what would be the second seed in the Eastern
Conference.


Whichever club loses that fight would have to settle for the
fifth spot behind two other division winners despite having a
better record than either of those clubs, Miami or Toronto.


The Wizards, who have lost All-Stars Gilbert Arenas and Caron
Butler to injuries, slid to 40-40 after their seventh loss in
eight games and could tumble from the sixth seed before the
season ends Wednesday.


"We wanted to put a lot of presure on them. We knew they had a
lot of guys out and we wanted to come out and take care of
business early," Gordon said.


Washington suffered its most lopsided loss of the season with the
Wizards producing their lowest point total of the season as well.
