Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"There are three possibilities. One is that someone could give
themselves up. Two, there could be a massive breakthrough or,
three, we are here for the long haul. At the moment we are
certainly in category three. We would love to move to one but I
think that is unlikely at this stage."


- Jamaica deputy police commissioner Mark Shields admitting that,
one month on, the murder of Bob Woolmer remains a mystery.


"It's basically a quarter-final for us and our fate is still in
our hands, which is a positive thing."


- South Africa's Jacques Kallis on the must-win match against
England on Tuesday.


"It has been disappointing. We have got to turn those
disappointing results around and hope to bring some of the pride
back into the team and into West Indies cricket."


- West Indies coach Bennett King.


"I think we have a very good record against Australia. Why?
Because we play our brand of cricket and we are not afraid of
doing that."


- Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene on Monday's mouth-watering
clash with the world champions.


"I'm feeling quite settled in the team now since being given my
place when Brett got injured. That feeling is also helping my
bowling and my rhythm."


- Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait.
