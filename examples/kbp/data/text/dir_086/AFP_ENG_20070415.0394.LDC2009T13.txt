Barcelona's Brazilian international defender Belletti will be out
of action for a month with a torn right thigh muscle, the Catalan
club announced here Sunday.


Belletti, the hero of Barca's 2006 Champions League triumph, came
on as a substitute nine minutes before the end of their 1-0 win
over Real Mallorca on Sunday but was soon limping.


The 30-year-old right back had only just recovered match fitness
after a recent groin problem which caused him to miss Barca's 1-0
defeat at Real Zaragoza last week.


He will forever be remembered by Barcelona fans for scoring the
winner in their 2-1 win over Arsenal in Paris last May, helping
the Spanish giants to become the kings of Europe for a second
time after their victory in 1992.
