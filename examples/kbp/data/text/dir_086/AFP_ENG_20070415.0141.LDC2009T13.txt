The rights group of Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi on
Sunday condemned the detention of teachers who have staged public
protests over low wages.


The Defenders of Human Rights Centre said that more than a dozen
teachers had been arrested in recent days, following an earlier
spate of arrests in March after public demonstrations.


"Although most of the March detainees have been released,
confronting teachers' unions and arresting other teachers in
recent days is a clear sign of human rights being violated," the
group said in a statement.


The group "condemned" the detention of 13 teachers in the capital
Tehran and in the western city of Hamedan, as well as "the
summoning of teachers by irrelevant institutions."


It also called on the Islamic republic's authorities to refrain
from "ill- considered actions... given today's sensitive
conditions."


The statement did not say what had prompted the latest arrests.


Thousands of teachers gathered in front of the Iranian parliament
in three unusual protests in March, demanding higher salaries and
accusing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of not keeping his
election promises to spread wealth.


Teachers in Iran earn between 200 and 300 dollars a month, which
is not enough to make ends meet, especially in the capital,
forcing many to take second jobs in the private sector or to work
as taxi drivers.
