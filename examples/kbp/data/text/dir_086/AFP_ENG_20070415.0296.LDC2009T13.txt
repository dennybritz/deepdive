A decision to withhold some Serbian documents from the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) was flawed and got Belgrade
off the hook for war crimes, a former top prosecutor said Sunday.


Geoffrey Nice, a former lead prosecutor at the war crimes trial
of former Serbian and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, said
chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte had erred in 2003
by accepting Belgrade's argument that some papers should be kept
secret for national security reasons.


"This was a useless pact which only helped Belgrade hide from the
International Court of Justice proof of its role during the
conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia," he said in a letter to
Croatia's Jutarnji List daily.


Nice said Del Ponte had given in to Belgrade's demand in May 2003
in a letter to then foreign minister of Serbia-Montenegro, Goran
Svilanovic.


Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the UN should probe the
allegation.


"If it is confirmed, it should be discussed at the United
Nations... probably before the Security Council," he said.


The ICJ, which was dealing with Bosnia's lawsuit against Serbia,
ruled in February that Serbia was not guilty of genocide and
absolved it from paying potentially huge war reparations.


It however branded the July 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslims
by Bosnian-Serb forces in Srebrenica as genocide and said
Belgrade did not do enough to prevent it.
