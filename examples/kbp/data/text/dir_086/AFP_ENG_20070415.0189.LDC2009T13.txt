Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian on Sunday presided over a
national security drill to test the island's contingency plans in
the event of a Chinese attack.


"President Chen presided over the 20-hour drill aimed to evaluate
government officials' ability to manage (a) national crisis
sparked by the enemy's ballistic missile attack," the National
Security Council said in a statement.


Premier Su Tseng-chang and his cabinet members participating in
the drill demonstrated how they would quickly restore order
should war break out in the Taiwan Strait, it said.


"Only by continued practice and verification of the existing
contingency plans during peacetime could damage and losses be
reduced in case of war," the president said after a similar drill
last week.


"Through the exercise, the government's capability to manage
crises has been enhanced," he said.


Tensions between Taiwan and China have escalated since
independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian was elected
president in 2000. He was narrowly re- elected in 2004.


China considers Taiwan part of its territory and has repeatedly
threatened to invade the island should it declare formal
independence.
