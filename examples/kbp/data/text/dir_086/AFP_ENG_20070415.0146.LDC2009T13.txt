The bodies of six oil tanker drivers, five of them Iranian, were
found dumped in Iraq on Sunday, one day after they were ambushed,
an Iraqi border guard official said.


Iraqi troops picked up the bodies near the town of Khanaqin in
the increasingly dangerous province of Diyala not far from the
Iranian border, said border guard Brigadier General Nadhem
Mohammed Sharif.


Insurgents ambushed the drivers on Saturday as they were
importing oil into Iraq from neighbouring Iran, Sharif said.


He said Iraqi authorities had tried to hand the bodies of the
five Iranians over to the Iranian authorities at the Al-
Mundhiryah border crossing point but were instead told to contact
Iran's embassy.


The sixth corpse belonged to an Iraqi driver, Sharif said.
