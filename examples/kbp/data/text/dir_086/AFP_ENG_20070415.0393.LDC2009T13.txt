Nicolas Almagro of Spain successfully defended his title in the
first clay-court ATP event of the European season here on Sunday.


The 21-year-old Almagro, ranked 31st in the world, beat Italy's
Potito Starace 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 in the final of the 353,450-euro
Valencia Open.


Almagro, who had beaten Starace last month in Miami, was
favourite though 25 -year-old Potito, ranked 89th, had the better
start to take the first set 6-4 in his first tour final.


But from 2-2 in the second set, Almagro went into overdrive to
win the set 6-2 and then the final set 6-1.


"This tournament in Valencia is like a lucky charm for me," said
Almagro. "Last year I said that the city would always have a
place in my heart and that's even more true today."
