US lawmakers moved quickly to show support for Chicago's 2016
Olympics bid, announcing plans here Sunday for legislation to
ease visa hassles for Olympic athletes, officials and coaches.


One day after the US Olympic Committee Board of Directors
approved the Illinois city over co-finalist Los Angeles as the US
bid candidate for the 2016 Olympics, state lawmakers Dick Durbin
and Rahm Emanuel made their move.


"Today we announce plans to introduce legislation to ensure that
Olympic participants are not prevented from competing by
bureaucratic delays," the US Democrats said in a statement.


"Chicago is the best place in the world for the 2016 Olympics and
we are going to do our part to make sure that we are the best
hosts in the world."


The bill, if passed into law, would ensure Olympic-related
visitors receive visas efficiently and in a timely manner to
avoid potential headaches.


Such shows of federal government support enhance the hopes of bid
candidate cities when the IOC begins comparing rival bids from
around the world.


The central US city joins a race that already includes Tokyo,
Madrid, Prague and Rio de Janeiro with more cities expected to
join the hunt before the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
bid deadline later this year.


The IOC will decide on a 2016 Summer Olympics host in October of
2009. Beijing will host next year's edition of the Games with
London already set for 2012. Vancouver, Canada, will play host to
the 2010 Winter Olympics.
