High winds forced tournament officials to postpone the finish of
the final round of the US PGA Verizon Heritage until Monday.


Heavy gusts on the concluding holes along the water swept balls
from their positions and broke limbs off trees, prompting
officials to suspend play just after the last trio had reached
the first green and later end play for the day.


Jerry Kelly remained in the lead at 13-under par, one stroke
ahead of his playing partners in the last round, fellow American
Kevin Na and South African Ernie Els.


Play was scheduled to resume early Monday morning, setting up the
first Monday finish at the event since Argentina's Jose Coceres
defeated Billy Mayfair in a 2001 playoff for his first US PGA
title.


American Zach Johnson, the surprise winner of the Masters a week
ago, shared fifth, four strokes off the pace, after completing
the first hole of his final round.
