Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo's vote cast during a state
governorship and parliamentary poll in his native city has been
cancelled because of irregularities at his electoral ward,
officials said Sunday.


Obasanjo voted on Saturday in Abeokuta but the entire result of
the Totoro/Sokori ward number 11 was invalidated, Ogun State
resident electoral commissioner Godfrey Miri told journalists in
the southwestern state capital.


According to witnesses, eight ballot boxes were hijacked in
different polling centres, an action which led to street protests
by voters.


The police said, however, that they had recovered seven of these
boxes which were stuffed with more ballot papers than before they
were taken away.


The eighth box was still missing.


In Ogun, Obasanjo's home state, the ruling Peoples Democratic
Party (PDP) won the state governorship and 25 of the 26 seats in
the local parliament.


A court had annulled the presidential election that took place in
the state in April 2003, due to irregularities. Obasanjo was re-
elected in that poll, contested by his closest rival, Muhammadu
Buhari, who is also a candidate in this year's poll.


Saturday's election across the country is scheduled to be
followed on April 21 with presidential and National Assembly
elections.
