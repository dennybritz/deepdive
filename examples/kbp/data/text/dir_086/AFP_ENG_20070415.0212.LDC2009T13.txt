A 34-year-old Greek woman living in Germany has been arrested for
trying to seduce a teenager over the Internet, police here said
Sunday.


The married woman was arrested at her Athens hotel on Saturday
after the teenager's mother reported her to the police following
her son's confession.


The woman had arranged a tryst at her hotel with the 15-year-old
with whom she had been corresponding for three months and had
regularly sent money and presents.


Greek police rarely arrest men for soliciting sex from minors, a
police source said, despite the growing sex trade in the country.
