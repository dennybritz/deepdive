A man escaped from jail in eastern Belgium on Sunday when a
hijacked helicopter dropped down into the prison yard and picked
him up, Belgian media reported.


The helicopter later landed near the jail, where the escapee and
two others fled on foot.


Two men had reserved the helicopter Sunday afternoon. Once on
board, they took the pilot and instructor hostage, threatening
them with grenades and ordering them to fly to the prison in
Lantin in eastern Belgium.


"One of the individuals pointed a pistol at my temple and another
showed me a grenade," the pilot told broadcaster RTBF. "They said
that they had nothing to lose."


Once above the prison, one of the men threw smoke bombs in the
yard, where some detainees were located. The pilot was forced to
land in the yard, and a prisoner climbed on board.


The pilot took off and landed several hundred metres (hundreds of
feet) away in a field, where the two men and the prisoner fled on
foot.


Belga news agency identified the prisoner as a French national
named Erik Ferdinand who was born in 1976 and accused of thefts
and forgeries.


He had earlier fled from custody in Spain and was re-arrested
several weeks ago in Belgium, the agency said.
