UN atomic energy chief Mohamed ElBaradei called on Sunday on Iran
and Israel to join a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, after
talks in Jordan with King Abdullah II, the palace said.


"At the end of the day the Middle East should be a zone free of
weapons of mass destruction, a zone in which Israel and Iran are
both members," ElBaradei said, according to a palace statement.


"This is the last chance to build security in the Middle East
based on trust and cooperation and not the possession of nuclear
weapons," the International Atomic Energy Agency chief said.


ElBaradei was quoted as saying that a peace deal between Israel
and its Arab neighbours "must be reached in parallel with a
security agreement in the region based on ridding the region of
all weapons of mass destruction."


He also noted that "Arab countries have joined the Non-
Proliferation Treaty while Israel hasn't."


Israel is considered the sole, albeit undeclared, nuclear power
in the region with an arsenal of around 200 warheads.


Its archfoe Iran is suspected by the West of using a nuclear
energy programme to try to develop atomic weapons, something
Tehran vehemently denies.
