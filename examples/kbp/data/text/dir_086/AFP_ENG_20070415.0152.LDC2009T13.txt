Police arrested Eduard Limonov, one of the leaders of the
opposition group The Other Russia, as he left a protest rally in
Saint Petersburg, his spokesman told AFP Sunday.


"His bodyguard called to say that Limonov was being arrested.
Then there was a noise and we lost contact," the radical leftist
leader's spokesman, Alexander Averin, said. "This took place
after the demonstration had finished.


If confirmed, this would be the second detention of a leader from
The Other Russia over the weekend. On Saturday, police detained
and fined former world chess champion Garry Kasparov at a banned
protest rally in Moscow.


Limonov heads the National Bolshevik Party, a radical youth
organisation which has been banned by the Russian authorities as
extremist.


The protest in Saint Petersburg, where Limonov was one of the
speakers, was attended by up to 2,000 people. Scuffles and
arrests followed the peaceful rally as police herded activists
toward the underground metro station.
