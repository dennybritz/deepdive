Germany is to extend by two years until 2011 restrictions on the
number of immigrant workers from the latest nations to join the
European Union, a report said Saturday.


The weekly Der Spiegel, in an extract from its next edition to
appear Monday, said officials in Germany's left-right coalition
government had agreed on the move in a meeting on low pay.


The restrictions Germany adopted in 2004 against eight countries
which joined the EU in 2004, plus Bulgaria and Romania when they
became members last January 1, were designed to protect its
labour market.


They are particularly aimed at neighbours Poland and the Czech
Republic, which border the former East Germany, the most
economically depressed region of the country.


The extension is a rebuff to Economy Minister Michael Glos, who
wanted the restrictions lifted early.
