Sidiki Diarra and Didier Notheaux have been appointed joint
managers of Burkina Faso, the pair succeeding Idrissa Traore who
was fired last weekend.


Traore was sacked less than one year into his contract after
Burkina's poor showing in the 2008 African Nations Cup qualifying
competition.


Confirming the appointment the national football federation (FBF)
said on Saturday: "The FBF has named two managers, France's
Didier Notheaux and Sidiki Diarra of Burkina Faso to coach the
national team in the run-up to the African Nations Cup."


The statement added that the pair had been chosen "because of
their good knowledge of football" in the country.


The two men are no strangers to the job, Notheaux having already
held the post between 1998 and 1999 and Diarra replacing him from
2000 to 2001.


Burkina Faso are placed third in their 2008 African Nations cup
qualifying group behind Tanzania and Senegal.


Their next qualifier is against Mozambique on June 3 in Maputo.
