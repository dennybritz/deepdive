A demonstration against Russia's President Vladimir Putin in the
provincial city of Nizhny Novgorod was broken up Saturday and at
least 11 people arrested, police and the organisers said.


Organiser Yuri Staroverov told AFP by telephone that "dozens" of
people were arrested around or on the central square in the city
as they gathered for the protest that had not been authorised by
the authorities.


Some managed to shout "Russia without Putin" on Freedom Square
before being bundled away by police, who vastly outnumbered the
demonstrators, Starogverov said.


Some had been beaten, he alleged.


Police spokesman Alexander Gorbatov, quoted by Interfax news
agency, said that nine Russians and two people from Belarus had
been arrested in all. Some had been charged with taking part in
an unauthorised action and released.


In recent weeks hundreds have been arrested as riot police
forcefully broke up demonstrations by The Other Russia movement,
in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod.
