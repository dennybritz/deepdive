One of six German Tornado jets in Afghanistan was damaged
Saturday when the landing gear broke before touchdown, the German
military said, in the first incident involving the planes sent
three weeks ago.


The nose of the plane was also damaged but the crew was not
harmed, Captain Alexander von Heimann told AFP from the northern
city of Mazar-i-Sharif where the German deployment to Afghanistan
is based.


"This Tornado was going to touch down and one part of the front
gear broke. The Tornado did not crash. Nothing happened to the
crew," he said.


"The Tornado nose was damaged too," he said. "There is not less
confidence in these planes" after the incident, von Heimann said.


The jets arrived April 5 and have been carrying out air
surveillance and reconnaissance across the country in support of
NATO-led troops battling Taliban rebels.


They were accompanied by 200 personnel and 600 tonnes of
supplies.


The mandate of the planes does not include routine combat
operations.


Germany has about 3,000 troops in Afghanistan in a mission that
has sparked considerable controversy in the country wary of
sending troops into combat six decades after the end of World War
II.


Most of the soldiers are in the relatively calm north and the
government has resisted calls to send them to areas such as the
south and east where NATO troops are facing the fiercest fighting
and have called for reinforcements.
