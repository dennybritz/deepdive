Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"It took us nearly an hour to pay for few bottles of soft drinks,
ice creams and snacks. People are just going crazy buying up food
to watch the match. A win is worth the long queue."


- Sri Lanka fan Marisa de Silva stocking up on food to watch the
final on TV in Colombo.


"I'm happy to walk away from the game. I feel it's in a good
state, there are a lot of good young fast bowlers coming through
in Australia and I'm happy with what I've achieved and what the
team has achieved as well."


- Glenn McGrath reaches the end of the road.


"For guys like me, who've been around a while this is the reason
why you still play the game, to be involved in contests like this
one."


- Australia skipper Ricky Ponting looking forward to the final.


"Obviously they are a very good side, but they are also humans
and in 100 overs people do make mistakes and we need to
capitalise on them."


- Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene.


"Just because the final is taking place here (in the Caribbean)
does not mean it is any extra pressure for me than, say, my third
or fourth finals, for example. Each game has its pressures and
you have to deal with that."


- Umpire Steve Bucknor standing in his fifth successive World Cup
final.
