The report into the failures of last summer's war against
Hezbollah, due to published on Monday, will not call for Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's resignation, Channel 10 television
said on Saturday.


The station said the Winograd Commission report, of which it had
obtained a copy, denounces the "precipitous and unwise" manner in
which Olmert decided to start a war with the Shiite militia in
Lebanon.


While it does not explicitly demand the premier's dismissal, it
deplores the fact that he allowed himself to be influenced by
former military chief of staff Dan Halutz during the fighting,
without listening to other advice or coming up with a long-term
strategy, Channel 10 said.
