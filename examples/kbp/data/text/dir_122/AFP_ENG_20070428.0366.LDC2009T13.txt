Workers' representatives at Airbus's Hamburg factory said on
Saturday they will hold talks next week on their plan of action
following the announcement of 2,300 job cuts at the site.


The Franco-German aircraft maker announced the cuts on Friday as
part of its company-wide Power8 restructuring programme announced
in February and involving 10,000 job cuts in Europe over the next
four years.


Germany's powerful IG Metall union was expecting around 2,000
layoffs at Hamburg, the company's second-biggest factory after
Toulouse, France. Talks on the cuts will form the basis of
discussions on other layoffs across Germany.


"On the one hand, Airbus is looking to hire 1,000 (workers) in
Germany. This is what is wrong," IG Metall spokesman Daniel
Friedrich said on television. "We are not going to accept this in
Germany."


The factory in northern Germany employs 12,000 people working on
the A380 "superjumbo" jet and the midsize A320 aircraft.
