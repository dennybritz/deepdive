A suicide car bomb attack near a revered Shiite shrine in the
central Iraqi city of Karbala killed at least 55 people and
wounded another 70 on Saturday, a health ministry official said.


"Many of the wounded are women and children," said Salim Kadhim,
spokesman for the Karbala health department.


A senior police officer on condition of anonymity confirmed the
attack as a suicide car bombing.


The blast erupted 200 metres (yards) from the shrine of Imam
Abbas, the second holiest in Karbala, at 7:10 pm (1310 GMT), said
Salim Kadhim, spokesman for the Karbala health department.


An April 14 bomb attack close to the Imam Hussein shrine, the
most revered in Karbala, killed 42 people and wounded scores
more.
