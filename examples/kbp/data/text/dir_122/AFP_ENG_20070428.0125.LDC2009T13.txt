Five captains of German industry have been shortlisted to replace
the chief executive of corruption-tainted engineering giant
Siemens, Klaus Kleinfeld, the weekly Focus said Saturday.


In an extract from a report to appear in its next edition on
Monday, Focus said the favourite was the head of the board of
Linde, the world leader in industrial gases, Wolfgang Reitzle.


Reitzle, who has also been tipped by other German media since
Kleinfeld announced his departure on Wednesday, is preferred by
the chairman of the Siemens supervisory board, Gerhard Cromme,
who drew up the shortlist, Focus said.


Kleinfeld, 49, said he would leave his post by September to allow
Siemens to focus on weathering the far-reaching corruption
scandal, even though he has not personally been implicated.


The German business daily Handelsblatt said on Thursday that he
would be replaced by Cromme, one-time head of steel and heavy
industry giant ThyssenKrupp.


Cromme has a reputation as a strong advocate of 'clean' corporate
governance and is believed to have played a leading role in
forcing Kleinfeld out in a move that was sharply criticised by
shareholders' groups.


Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens' former chief executive, also
formally stepped down Wednesday as head of the supervisory board.


Siemens is suspected of trying to bribe key union officials to
secure industrial peace, and set up a massive slush-fund to
obtain foreign contracts.


Siemens is Germany's biggest employer and has more than 450,000
workers worldwide. It builds trains, power plants and
manufactures medical and telecommunications equipment.
