The first derby between South African clubs Orlando Pirates and
Kaizer Chiefs at Ellis Park since the disaster of 2001 passed
without incident Saturday.


On April 11 six years ago, Pirates and Chiefs met in a floodlit
game at the venue that ended with 43 dead after massive pre-match
crowd congestion outside the stadium triggered a stampede.


Unlike 2001, no one without a ticket was allowed near the stadium
on the fringe of the city centre, and gates opened six hours
before kickoff.


A steady stream of supporters arrived at the stadium throughout
the day, avoiding congestion.


Ellis Park was almost full and Chiefs and Pirates supporters
behaved impeccably throughout the league fixture.


The Premier Soccer League chose not to commemorate those who lost
their lives with the traditional minute's silence prior to the
kickoff.


Pirates and Chiefs drew 1-1 in a match that had no bearing on the
title, which was clinched by Mamelodi Sundowns last weekend.


Ivory Coast-born striker Serge Djiehoua opened the scoring for
Chiefs late in the first half and Pirates defender Lucky
Lekgwathi levelled midway through the second half.
