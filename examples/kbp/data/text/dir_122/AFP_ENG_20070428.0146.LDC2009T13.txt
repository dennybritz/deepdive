Malaysia's ruling coalition fended off a spirited opposition
campaign led by former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim in a
crucial by-election Saturday.


The ruling national front or Barisan Nasional retained the semi-
rural Ijok seat in central Selangor state against the People's
Justice Party, or Keadilan, with an increased majority, the
Election Commission announced.


"I declare K. Parthiban from Barisan Nasional as the state
assemblyman for Ijok," said election official Haris Kasim.


Parthiban secured 5,884 votes while Keadilan's Abdul Khalid
Ibrahim got 4,034 votes, Kasim said.


"Barisan won with a majority of 1,850 votes," he said.


A a total of 10,049 voters or 81.9 percent of the 12,272 eligible
voters had cast their ballots, a record turnout for the
constituency.


"I am sad for Malaysia," Anwar told reporters.
