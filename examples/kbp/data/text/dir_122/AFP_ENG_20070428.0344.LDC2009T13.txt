More than 20,000 people rallied in the Ukrainian capital on
Saturday in support of President Viktor Yushchenko's decision to
dissolve parliament.


"The planned elections will take place without fail," Yushchenko
told the crowd. "They will be honest and democratic."


Demonstrators yelled the president's name and waved orange flags,
a symbol reminiscent of the Orange Revolution that swept the pro-
Western Yushchenko into office over his pro-Russian rival in
2004.


Not far away, several thousand protesters gathered in support of
Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, who has rejected the
president's order to dissolve parliament. Police barricades
divided the two groups of protesters.


Yanukovych on Saturday took a more conciliatory tone, calling for
Yushchenko to return to the negotiating table and saying he could
consider holding early parliamentary elections. He did not
clarify whether he would continue to insist that early
presidential elections also be held, a possibility that
Yushchenko has ruled out.


"If we sit down and decide that elections are what we really
need, such a decision will be taken," Yanukovych told
journalists.


Political life has been paralysed for weeks by the stand-off
between the president and prime minister, who heads the pro-
Russian governing coalition in parliament.
