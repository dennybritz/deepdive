The pope on Saturday concluded a special summit with Catholic
leaders in the Middle East, where he expressed support for the
"challenges" faced by the church's 150,000 followers there.


Benedict XVI told senior representatives of the Syro-Catholic
Church that he had called the meeting to "revive more intensely
the age-old links which unite your church with the apostolic
seat", a statement from the Holy See said.


The summit was also held to highlight "the problems and the
difficulties which the well-deserving Syro-Catholic Church has
encountered for some time".


"There are so many challenges facing Christian communities in all
parts of the world," the pope said.


He cited "the violence and conflict" experienced by many
followers of the Syro- Catholic Church, and "which put in danger
not only the ability to live together in peace but also people's
lives."


Benedict XVI urged the church's leaders to continue their
"missionary activities."


The Syro-Catholic Church, which joined with Rome in 1783, has
about 150,000 followers, mostly in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.
