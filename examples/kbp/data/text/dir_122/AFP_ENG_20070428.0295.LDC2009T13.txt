Excavation work began Saturday in Tallinn at the site where a
Soviet war monument used to stand to determine if any World War
II soldiers lie buried there, defence ministry officials said.


"If any remains are found they will be exhumed and reburied at
the military cemetery," Defence Minister Jaak Aaviksoo said after
an all-faiths religious service was held in the large white tent
put up at the site this week before the monument was moved.


"This is necessary in order to ensure they repose in a peaceful
burial place," he said.


The 2.5-metre (eight-feet) tall solid bronze statue of a Soviet
Red Army soldier was removed by Estonian officials in the early
hours of Friday   following riots in Tallinn in which one person
died and scores were injured.


The Estonian capital was rocked on Friday night by more riots.
Since the unrest began, around 800 people have been detained,
many of them drunken teenagers.


The Bronze Soldier is seen by Estonians as a symbol of 50 years
of Soviet occupation, during which tens of thousands of Estonians
were murdered or deported and large numbers of ethnic Russians
shipped in as Moscow tried to 'russify' the Baltics.


Russia considers it a sacred memorial to the Red Army soldiers
who defeated Nazism in World War II and was vehemently against
its removal.


Excavation work was expected to take between three and five days,
Aaviksoo said.


"The sooner we complete the work, the better for all of us," he
said.


Historians believe around 14 people may have been buried under
the monument but there is no documented evidence.
