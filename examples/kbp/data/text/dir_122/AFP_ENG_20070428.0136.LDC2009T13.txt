Bayern Munich have signed Italian World Cup winner Luca Toni from
AC Fiorentina in a deal worth 18 million euros, it was reported
on Saturday.


The 29-year-old striker, who has scored 12 goals in 27
internationals, has signed a five-contract and will reportedly
earn 5.5 million euros per season according to German magazine
Sport-Bild.


The forward is believed to have made his decision on Friday
evening and chosen the German giants over European rivals AC
Milan, Juventus Turin and Inter Milan, who were also bidding for
his signature.


Having been part of Italy's 2006 World Cup squad, Toni scored two
goals in the quarter-finals win over the Ukraine and scored both
goals in Italy's 2-0 victoey against Scotland in last month's
Euro 2008 Qualifier.


Fourth-placed Bayern are also courting German international
Miroslav Klose, from their Bundesliga rivals Werder Bremen, and
last week met with the 67-times capped striker, who has scored 33
goals for his country.
