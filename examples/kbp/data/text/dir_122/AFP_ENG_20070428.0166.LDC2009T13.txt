Manchester United moved to the brink of reclaiming the
Premiership title after fighting back from two goals down to beat
Everton 4-2 on a day of rollercoaster drama on Saturday.


Wayne Rooney's 79th-minute strike and a stoppage time goal from
youngster Chris Eagles capped a remarkable fightback and ensured
that Sir Alex Ferguson's side took full advantage of Chelsea
being held to a 2-2 draw by Bolton at Stamford Bridge.
