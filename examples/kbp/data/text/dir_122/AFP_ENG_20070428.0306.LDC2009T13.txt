More than 20,000 people rallied in the Ukrainian capital on
Saturday in support of President Viktor Yushchenko's decision to
dissolve parliament.


"The planned elections will take place without fail," Yushchenko
told the crowd. "They will be honest and democratic."


Demonstrators yelled the president's name and waved orange flags,
a symbol reminiscent of the Orange Revolution that swept the pro-
Western Yushchenko into office over his pro-Russian rival in
2004.


Not far away, several thousand protesters gathered nearby in
support of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, who has rejected the
president's order to dissolve parliament. Police barricades
divided the two groups of protesters.


Yanukovych said on Saturday that he could consider holding early
parliamentary elections. But did not clarify whether he would
continue to insist that early presidential elections also be
held, a possibility that Yushchenko has ruled out.


Political life has been paralysed for weeks by the stand-off
between the president and prime minister, who heads the pro-
Russian governing coalition in parliament.
