Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych said on Saturday that
he could consider the holding of early parliamentary elections, a
key demand of his arch- rival President Viktor Yushchenko.


But Yanukovych did not clarify whether he would continue to
insist that early presidential elections also be held along with
the elections to the legislature, a possibility ruled out by
Yushchenko.


Feuding politicians "need to sit down at the negotiating table
and talk about what needs to be done to prepare for early
elections," Yanukovych said at a press conference in Kiev.


"If we sit down and decide that we really should hold elections,
then such a decision will be taken," Yanukovych said.


Yanukovych had previously categorically rejected an order issued
by Yushchenko on April 2 to dissolve parliament and hold early
elections, sparking a constitutional crisis.


Political life has been paralysed for weeks by the stand-off
between the pro- Western president and the prime minister, who
heads up the pro-Russian ruling coalition in parliament.
