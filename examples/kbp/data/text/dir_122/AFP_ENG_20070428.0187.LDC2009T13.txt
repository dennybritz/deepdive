A suicide truck bomber attacked an Iraqi police chief's house and
killed nine of his men and six civilians but missed his main
target, a US military spokesman said Saturday.


"The chief of police in Hit, General Hamid, was not killed," said
Lieutenant Shawn Mercer of the US marines, after Iraqi media
reported that the western town's chief of police, Hamid Hazaa,
had died in Friday's blast.


"At about 9:45 am (0545 GMT) his house was attacked by a suicide
truck bomber. Our reports were that nine Hit police and Iraqi
army soldiers, and six civilians died," Mercer said in a
statement to AFP.


"Three police and 32 civilians were also wounded; 25 were treated
and later released from the Hit hospital," he added.


Hit is a town in Anbar province in western Iraq in an area where
a coalition of Sunni tribes in alliance with Iraqi security
forces and the US military is fighting a bitter campaign against
the Al-Qaeda militant group.


The head of security for the Iraqi coalition, Colonel Tareq al-
Dulaimi, confirmed the attack, but put the death toll at only 12.


Al-Qaeda has responded with an onslaught of suicide bombings in
the region.
