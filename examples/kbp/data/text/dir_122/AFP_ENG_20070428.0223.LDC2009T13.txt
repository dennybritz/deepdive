Russian President Vladimir Putin paid tribute on Saturday to
master cellist Mstislav Rostropovich at a lying in state in
Moscow's music conservatory, an AFP photographer said.


Putin laid dark red roses by Rostropovich's open coffin in the
main hall of the conservatory and offered his condolences to the
widow of the musician, Galina Vishnevskaya, a celebrated opera
singer, who sat nearby.


Putin earlier honoured Rostropovich, who died on Friday in Moscow
at the age of 80, describing his death as "a terrible loss" and
offering his condolences to the family in comments broadcast on
state television.


"I know how bravely he fought until the last minute against the
most difficult ailment. Today we have lost a dear and close
person, and Russia, the whole world, has lost a great musician
and humanist," Putin said on Friday.


Putin attended grandiose 80th birthday celebrations for
Rostropovich last month at which the celebrated musician had
appeared frail and tired after an operation for a tumour in
February.
