Veteran German international Oliver Neuville will miss the final
three games of Bundesliga bottom-side's Borussia
Monchengladbach's relegation battle, it was revealed on Saturday.


The 33-year-old's season came to a premature close when he tore a
groin muscle in training last week and will be operated on in
Munich on Monday.


"We think Oliver will be out for four to six weeks and we decided
to have the operation now, so that he will be fit for pre-season
training," said 'Gladbach's doctor Stefan Hertl.


Neuville, who has scored nine goals in 65 internationals and was
a member of the German side that reached the 2002 World Cup
final, has had a terrible run of luck with injuries.


The Swiss-born forward, who was also a member of the Bayer
Leverkusen side that reached the 2002 Champions League final
where they lost to Real Madrid, had an operation in January for
an adductor injury and has played in less than half of
'Gladbach's games this season.
