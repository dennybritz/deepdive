Three people with links to the ruling Swedish Liberal Party have
been fined for hacking into the computer system of the opposition
Social Democrats, a party spokesman told AFP on Saturday.


"The court found that three of them were guilty," said Mikael
Persson, press secretary of the liberals, one of four parties in
a centre-right coalition that ousted the Social Democrats from
power last year.


Six people, including four liberals, were charged following the
spying scandal, in which the party's youth wing hacked into the
Social Democrats' computers to get details of their tactics for
September's legislative polls.


The three people convicted on Friday included the former head of
the liberals' youth wing, a young Social Democrat who provided
the computer access codes, and a former journalist for the
Expressen popular daily, Persson said.


They have been fined 3,600 Swedish kronor (395 euros, 540
dollars), 9,000 kronor and 8,000 kronor respectively, according
to the financial newspaper Dagens Industri.


Persson said that although only one member of the liberal party
had been convicted, "it's a very serious situation ... it's a
moral discussion".


On Monday, liberal chief Lars Leijonborg said he would resign in
September. He has been strongly criticised for failing to
revitalise his party, which won just 7.5 percent of the vote last
year, compared to 13.4 percent in 2002.
