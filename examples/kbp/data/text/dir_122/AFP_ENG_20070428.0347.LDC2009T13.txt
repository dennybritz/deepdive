Australia were 222-1 after 30 overs in the World Cup final
against Sri Lanka at Kensington Oval here on Saturday in a match
reduced to 38 overs a side because of rain.


Adam Gilchrist was on 148, the highest ever individual score in a
World Cup final, with skipper Ricky Ponting on 19.


Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist put on a huge 172 for the first
wicket in 22.5 overs before Hayden eventually fell for 38 off 55
balls when he was caughy by skipper Mahela Jayawardene off Lasith
Malinga.


Double-defending champions Australia, who won the toss and
elected to bat, were bidding for a third straight title and
fourth in all, both unprecedented achievements in the nine-
edition history of the World Cup.


They came into this match on the back of a record run of 28 games
unbeaten in World Cup cricket, including 22 straight wins.


Both sides were unchanged from their semi-final wins which had
seen Australia beat South Africa and Sri Lanka see off New
Zealand.


This match was fast bowler Glenn McGrath's last before
retirement.


Ahead of the final, the Australian fast bowler had 70 World Cup
wickets; his 25 to date in the 2007 edition was already a record
for a single event.


Sri Lanka's team contained three survivors from the side that won
the World Cup 11 years ago - Sanath Jayasuriya, Chaminda Vaas and
Muttiah Muralitharan.
