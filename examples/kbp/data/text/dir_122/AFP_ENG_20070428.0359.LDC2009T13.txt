India's largest private-sector lender ICICI Bank Saturday posted
lower-than- expected fourth-quarter earnings on the higher cost
of funds.


The New York stock exchange-listed bank said net profit for the
three months ending March 31 rose to 8.25 billion rupees (201
million dollars) from 7.89 billion rupees a year earlier.


Total income for the bank rose 54.2 percent at 84.95 billion
rupees, it said.


Indian commercial banks have seen strong growth in loans in
recent years as the domestic economy grew close to nine percent,
backed by a housing, capital goods and automobile sector boom.


However, bank margins have been hit by higher borrowing costs
after India's central bank tightened monetary policy in recent
months to curb inflation.


ICICI hiked the amount for provision and contingencies to 4.57
billion rupees from 910 million rupees a year ago.


The Reserve Bank of India earlier this year jacked up lending
rates twice and increased the amount of cash banks have to hold
with it.


India's inflation, at 6.09 percent for the week ended April 14,
is above the Reserve Bank's targeted tolerance level of 5.0
percent for the current financial year.


At Friday's close, ICICI shares fell 30.4 rupees or 3.15 percent
to 933.65 rupees.


ICICI Bank's total deposits grew 40 percent to 2.3 trillion
rupees (56 billion dollars) from 1.65 trillion rupees a year ago.
