Britain has enjoyed its warmest April for more than 140 years,
with an average temperature of 11.1 degrees Celsius (51.9 degrees
Fahrenheit), British meteorologists said Saturday.


The previous record was set in 1865, with an average of 10.6
degrees Celsius. The record-breaking temperatures are likely to
continue Saturday and Sunday, reaching up to 23 degrees Celsius
in some areas.


Latest figures from the Met Office suggest that the past year
could be the warmest for a decade, with average figures of 11.6
degrees Celsius.


Doctor Debbie Hemming, from the Met Office's climate change
research department, the Hadley Centre, stressed that temperature
increase was being experienced "on a global scale".


The Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs has warned
that the high temperatures could create smog in the next few
days.
