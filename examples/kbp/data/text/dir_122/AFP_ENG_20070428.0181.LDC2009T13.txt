The Suez Canal recorded 1.03 billion dollars in revenue for the
first quarter of 2007, up 20.6 percent from the same period the
previous year, the canal authority said on Saturday.


A total of 4,807 ships carrying 197.5 tonnes of goods used the
canal during the first three months of the year, an 8.7 percent
increase in the number of ships and 14.5 increase in weight of
goods, the authority said.


In March alone, the canal -- which recently hiked its crossing
fees -- registered 356.6 million dollars in revenue, the highest
recorded for the strategic waterway between Europe and Asia since
it opened in 1869.


The Suez Canal is Egypt's third largest source of foreign
currency earnings, after tourism and remittances from expatriate
workers.
