An American soldier deployed to Iraq has been jailed for 10
months for punching his sergeant after returning late from leave,
the military said in a statement on Saturday.


A court martial heard that Specialist Sean Maxwell, of the 324th
Military Police Battalion, in January intentionally failed to
return to Iraq after a holiday in the United States and had been
listed as "absent without leave."


When he did arrive late in Kuwait en route for his unit in
February "Maxwell proceeded to assault his First Sergeant by
striking him in the face and head with a closed fist," said a
statement from the US command in Baghdad.


Earlier this month, military judges at a court martial in Camp
Victory just outside Baghdad sentenced Maxwell to 10 months in
detention, after which he will be kicked out of the army with a
bad conduct discharge.
