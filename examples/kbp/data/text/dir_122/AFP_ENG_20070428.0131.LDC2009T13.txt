The bones of a prehistoric camel believed to be about 10,000
years old have been discovered at the site of a future Wal-Mart
store in Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix, The Arizona Republic
reported Saturday.


The newspaper said the find was made by John Babiarz, owner of a
local citrus nursery, after his company had dug up a hole to
plant an ornamental tree.


"There's no question that this is a camel," Brad Archer, curator
of the geology museum at Arizona State University, is quoted by
the daily as saying. "These creatures walked the land here until
about 8,000 years ago, when the same event that wiped out a great
deal of mammal life took place."


Babiarz has pursued his hobby of hunting for paleontologic
artifacts for more than 30 years, The Arizona Republic said.
