A recently revived Basque political party will be allowed to
operate after Spanish authorities determined that it had no links
to the ETA armed separatist group nor to a banned ETA-linked
party, a top judge said Saturday.


The Eusko Abertzale Akintza-Action Nationalist Basque party (EAE-
ANV) can legally operate and will not be subject to the ban
applying to the Batasuna party, judge Baltasar Garzon said in a
statement.


"We cannot determine that ANV is an instrument of ETA-Batasuna,
even though it has some affinities in terms of its goals,"
Baltasar said, after receiving police reports on the party.


The EAE-ANV was one of the founding elements of Batasuna in 1978,
but had been inoperative until recently. It has presented
candidates for May 27 municipal and regional elections.


Batasuna has been prohibited as a party since 2003 because of
suspected ties to ETA, which has been blamed for over 800 deaths
in its four-decade campaign to achieve independence for the
Basque region of Spain and the Basque part of southwestern
France.


In March, Batasuna presented a new party, Abertzale Sozialisten
Batasuna, to contest the May elections, but it too was expected
to be banned.
