Security forces killed two Islamists early Saturday east of the
capital, days after the army killed a high-ranking leader of a
group affiliated to al-Qaeda, authorities said.


One of the two killed was identified as Azzedine Kermiche, 31, a
security source said, adding that two submachine guns were
recovered.


The incident occurred in the region of Boumerdes, some 50
kilometres (30 miles) east of Algiers.


On Thursday, the army killed Samir Saioud, alias Samir Moussaab,
believed to be the second-ranking leader in the Salafist Group
for Preaching and Combat, recently renamed as Al-Qaeda's branch
in northern Africa.


The group claimed responsibility for a series of car bomb attacks
earlier this month at the government's headquarters and another
location that killed 30 people and injured more than 200.


Since the beginning of April, more than 80 people have been
killed by violence in Algeria, according to numbers established
through official counts and media reports.


Meanwhile on Saturday, Algeria's parliament announced it would
propose increased international cooperation on fighting terrorism
at an upcoming assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.


The union is an organisation of parliaments for sovereign states,
with more than 140 national parliaments as members. The assembly
is set to begin April 29 in Bali, Indonesia.
