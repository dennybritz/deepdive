A group of Russian parliamentarians will visit Estonia on Monday
to look into the unrest surrounding the removal of a Soviet war
memorial, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting the speaker
of the Duma lower house of parliament.


The delegation of lawmakers will inform the Estonian side about a
resolution passed on Friday condemning the removal of the
memorial as a "blasphemous violation" and will see firsthand the
situation on the ground, the speaker of parliament, Boris
Gryzlov, said.


"We are especially worried about the fate of detained Russian
citizens and our compatriots," he said, without giving details.


The visit comes after President Vladimir Putin expressed "serious
concern" following rioting in the Estonian capital.


In a phone conversation with Putin, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel called for restraint on both sides.
