The daughters of Argentine football legend Diego Maradona
expressed disappointment at reports that their father had died
and said he was doing well after entering a clinic for alcohol
abuse.


The daughters dismissed as "lies" rumors of Maradona's death that
had spread Wednesday.


"Clinically he is perfectly fine, a little weak, splendid.
Everything they have said is lies," Dalma Maradona, 20, told a
popular Argentine television program late Friday hosted by Susana
Giminez.


She said that the former Argentine World Cup winning captain, 46,
agonizes over what has happened to her father and his family.


"Fortunately papa is much better, everything they have said has
no foundation," said her sister Giannina, 17.


Maradona entered the Avril psychiatric clinic in Buenos Aires a
week ago for extended rehab after being hospitalized for
hepatitis-related pain.


The ex-Argentina World Cup captain and Barcelona star's career on
and off the football pitch has been marred by repeated drug and
alcohol abuse. He was hospitalized in 2000 and 2004 for heart
attacks provoked by cocaine overdoses.
