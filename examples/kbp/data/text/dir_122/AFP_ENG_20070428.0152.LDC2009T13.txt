Rain delayed the scheduled 9am local (1300GMT) toss in the World
Cup Final between Australia and Sri Lanka at Kensington Oval here
Saturday.


Light rain started falling at approximately 8.30am local time
under overcast skies and this prompted groundstaff to cover both
the pitch and square.


The match, scheduled to start at 9.30am local time (1330GMT), is
now set to be delayed.


For the game to be completed Saturday, a minimum of 20 overs per
side must be bowled. Otherwise the match will continue into
Sunday's reserve day from where it left off Saturday.


Australia were bidding for an unprecedented third straight title
and fourth overall, having also won the World Cup in 1987.


It was also their fourth successive appearance in the final,
having been beaten by Sri Lanka in 1996.


Sri Lanka were playing in their second World Cup final following
their win 11 years ago.


This was the ninth World Cup Final, the first staged in the
Caribbean.
