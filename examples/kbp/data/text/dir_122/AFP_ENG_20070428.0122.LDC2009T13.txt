British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a rare admission of error
by conceding that he had been wrong about how to tackle teenage
tearaways and problem families in an article published Saturday.


Blair, who will celebrate 10 years as premier next week and is
expected to announce his resignation soon afterwards, was
speaking about his "respect" agenda to deal with petty bad
behaviour, often among young people.


He said he had initially believed that families with "feckless
and irresponsible children" could be helped by investing large
amounts of money in poor neighbourhoods in a series of high-
profile policies.


But he wrote in the Daily Telegraph that he does not now believe
that this approach offered a complete solution.


"What I have learned over those 10 years is that the original
analysis I had was incomplete and therefore literally misguided,
ie guiding us to the wrong policy conclusion... in the sense that
it will not deal with this small and unrepresentative minority,"
he wrote.


And he added that laws on anti-social behaviour, which have been
criticised by civil liberties campaigners, did not go far enough
as they stood.
