A suicide car bomb attack near a revered Shiite shrine in the
central Iraqi city of Karbala killed at least 55 people and
wounded nearly 160 on Saturday, a health ministry official said.


"Many of the wounded are women and children," said Salim Kadhim,
spokesman for the Karbala health department.


A senior police officer on condition of anonymity confirmed the
attack as a suicide car bombing.


The blast erupted 200 metres (yards) from the shrine of Imam
Abbas, the second holiest in Karbala, at 7:10 pm (1510 GMT), said
Kadhim.


An April 14 bomb attack close to the Imam Hussein shrine, the
most revered in Karbala, killed 42 people and wounded scores
more.
