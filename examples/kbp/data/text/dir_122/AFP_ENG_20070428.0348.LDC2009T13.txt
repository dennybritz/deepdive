Leeds could face disciplinary action from the English Football
Association after a pitch invasion delayed the end of their match
against Ipswich on Saturday.


Dennis Wise's side are doomed to relegation from the Championship
after a 1-1 draw at Elland Road left them three points behind
Hull with an inferior goal difference and just one game to play.


The prospect of playing outside the top two divisions of English
football for the first time was clearly too much for some Leeds
fans to take and, with just seconds to play, they poured onto the
field, forcing both teams to sprint to the safety of the changing
rooms.


The match was eventually finished after a 25-minute delay, but
Leeds could face a heavy fine if they are found guilty of failing
to control the crowd.


Football League head of communications John Nagle confirmed that
the incident would be investigated.


"Clearly, passions will run high at this stage of the season," he
said. "However, it is deplorable for supporters to enter the
field of play at any time.


"The events at Elland Road will be a matter for the Football
Association to investigate and these actions by a minority of
Leeds supporters could have serious consequences for the club."
