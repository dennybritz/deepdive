Seven bystanders were killed and four people injured when a
military helicopter plunged into a busy street on the central
Philippine island of Cebu on Saturday, officials and radio
reports said.


The Vietnam-era UH-1H "Huey" helicopter, with four crewmen
aboard, was flying low, returning from a training flight when it
crashed on a busy street in Lapu- Lapu City, said local air force
wing commander Colonel Butch Lacson.


Eyewitnesses were quoted in radio reports as saying the aircraft
got tangled in some power lines and crashed on an area where
motorized tricycles were picking up commuters, killing passengers
and drivers.


The four military men on board were injured in the crash and had
to be cut free from the wreckage, Lacson said.


The cause of the crash is still being investigated and all the
air force's UH-1H helicopters have been grounded after the
incident, Lacson said.


The poorly-equipped Philippine air force has suffered from
several aircraft crashes in recent years as much of its equipment
is already getting old.


Last December, an air force MG-520 helicopter gunship went down
in the southern Philippines, injuring two people aboard.
