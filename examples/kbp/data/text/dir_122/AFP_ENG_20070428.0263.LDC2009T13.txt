At least 22 people were killed and 25 wounded including a federal
minister when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a political
rally in northwest Pakistan Saturday, the interior ministry said.


"Twenty-two people were killed and 25 others are wounded in the
suicide attack," ministry's spokesman Brigadier Javed Cheema told
AFP.


He said five policemen were among those killed in the blast,
which struck a rally addressed by Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao
at Charsada district in North West Frontier Province bordering
Afghanistan.


Cheema said the minister, who sustained minor injuries, was the
target of the bomber who prematurely detonated the bomb when
police stopped him from closing in on Sherpao.
