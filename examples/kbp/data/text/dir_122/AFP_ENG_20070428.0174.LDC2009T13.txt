New Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will attend an
international conference on Iraq's reconstruction in Egypt next
week, the ministry announced Saturday.


It would be the first overseas mission for Yang as the country's
top diplomat after succeeding Li Zhaoxing who retired on Friday.


The Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh is hosting the
reconstruction conference on May 3 and 4 to be followed by a
"widened" ministerial meeting of countries neighbouring Iraq
which Yang was also due to attend, according to a statement on
the foreign ministry's website.


Besides Iraq's neighbours, UN and European Union representatives
and members of the Group of Eight were due to attend the
conference to study means of stabilising the situation in the
violence-ravaged country.
