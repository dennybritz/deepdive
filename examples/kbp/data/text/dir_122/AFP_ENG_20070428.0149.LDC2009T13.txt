Brazilian striker Magno Alves scored twice to lead front-runners
Gamba Osaka to a 4-0 victory over his old club Oita Trinita in
J-League football on Saturday.


Satoshi Yamaguchi opened the scoring in the fifth minute and
Magno Alves fired an unstoppable shot from close range two
minutes later.


Substitute striker Ryuji Bando made it 3-0 in the 71st minute and
Magno Alves completed the scoring in the 77th.


Osaka's midfielders kept the pressure on the Oita attackers and
never allowed them to create a clear scoring chance.


"Overall, my players played a good game. I don't want to point
out their mistakes, but I want them to play better," said Osaka
coach Akira Nishino.


The 2005 champions have now six wins and one draw against one
defeat for 19 points to stretch their lead to two points above
Kashiwa Reysol and four points above Nagoya Grampus Eight and
Jubilo Iwata.


"The most important thing is to win and stay top of the table.
I'm glad I helped the team to win," said Magno Alves.


Kawasaki Frontale and Urawa Red Diamonds, who play JEF United
Chiba and Kashima Antlers on Sunday respectively, trail on 14
points.


In other matches, Jubilo Iwata beat Sanfrecce Hiroshima 4-2 and
Yokohama Marinos beat Albirex Niigata 6-0.


Japanese Olympic team striker Lee Tadanari helped Kashiwa Reysol
beat Nagoya Grampus Eight 2-0 with a 25th-minute goal, while
Yokohama FC gained the first point in six games by drawing with
Shimizu S-Pulse 1-1 thanks to Daisuke Ichikawa's own goal in the
75th minute.


Meanwhile, Ventforet Kofu downed Omiya Ardija 2-1 and FC Tokyo
were held to a goalless draw by Vissel Kobe.
