The Swiss government on Saturday refused to confirm a visit next
month by Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya, the day after
it was announced by a Palestinian foreign ministry official.


"The federal department of foreign affairs has not received an
official request for such a visit," the ministry's spokesman Lars
Knuchel told AFP. He did not say whether Haniya had been invited
to the country.


Haniya is a member of Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist
organisation by the United States and the European Union.


On Friday, the Palestinian official told AFP on condition of
anonymity that the prime minister would visit Switzerland in May,
without giving a set date.


It would be Haniya's first trip to Europe since Hamas won the
Palestinian elections in early 2006.


"This visit follows an agreement between Palestinian foreign
minister Ziad Abu Amr and Swiss President Micheline Calmy-Rey,"
the source said.


While some European nations have met with non-Hamas members of
the new Palestinian government, Norwegian deputy foreign minister
Raymand Johansen is the only Western official to have met Haniya
or any other Hamas minister.


Switzerland, which like Norway is not a member of the European
Union, has never cut its ties with the Palestinian authorities
and has said it is ready to talk with all members of the new
government.
