An earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale slightly shook
Mexico's tourist resort of Acapulco on the Pacific coast Saturday
and triggered an alert in Mexico City, authorities said.


No injuries or damage were reported after the quake struck at
1356 GMT with its epicenter 11 kilometers from Acapulco, the
National Seismology Service said.


But power was lost in parts of Acapulco and some hotels were
evacuated as a precaution, said the civil protection chief,
captain Jorge Antonio Pacheco.


The tremblor was also felt in the Mexican capital in south-
central Mexico, sparking an alert.
