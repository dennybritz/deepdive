Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack has undergone an operation on
his left ankle, the German football federation (DFB) announced on
Saturday.


The Germany captain picked up the knock in the scoreless draw
against Newcastle last week, and was operated on Friday after
consulting the German national side's staff doctor.


The DFB said they did not know how long Ballack would be
sidelined while he recovers. The statement did not say whether
the 30-year-old will play again this season.


Chelsea's chances of defending their Premiership crown took a
knock on Saturday when they drew 2-2 with Bolton and leaders
Manchester United beat Everton 4-2 to secure a five-point lead.


Jose Mourinho's men play the second leg of their Champions League
semi-final against Liverpool with a 1-0 first leg lead this week.
