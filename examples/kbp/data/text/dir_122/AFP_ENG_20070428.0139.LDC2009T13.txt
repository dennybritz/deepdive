Nikolay Davydenko will test an injured wrist when he plays as top
seed at the Estoril Open starting on Sunday.


The early start, trialled this month at Monte Carlo and at Roland
Garros last spring, is part of an ATP-inspired marketing push
designed to give fans an extra weekend day of tennis.


The Portugal event had also been planning to experiment with the
now-cancelled round-robin tournament format.


World number four Davydenko was forced to withdraw from a Friday
quarter-final at Barcelona after an over-enthusiastic deep-tissue
massage left him with blocked nerves in his right wrist.


But the ever-ready Russian believes he can pull up for his start
at the Estadio Nacional clay when he takes on a qualifier.


Davydenko won the Estoril title in 2003 and lost last year's
final to Argentine David Nalbandian.


Out injured is Briton Andy Murray, with the Scots-born teenager
not yet ready to risk a sore back which kept him from singles
play at Monte Carlo.


The world number ten is hoping to get in his first clay event
next week at the Rome Masters.


Spain's Tommy Robredo takes the second seeding while Miami
champion Novak Djokovic is seeded third at his Estoril debut.


The talented Serb opens against Russian Igor Andreev.


Australian Open finalist Fernando Gonzalez of Chile is seeded
fourth, starting with Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu.


Compatriot Richard Gasquet is fifth, ahead of Russian Dmitry
Tursunov.


On the women's side, France's Marion Bartoli heads the field
ahead of Italian Francesca Schiavone and Czech Lucie Safarova.
