Opposition politicians boycotted a vote by Congo's parliament to
set up an "independent" election commission, whose members will
be named by the president, parliamentary sources said Saturday.


The move by the 137-seat national assembly dominated by
supporters of President Denis Sassou Nguesso comes before
legislative elections scheduled for June 24.


The opposition walked out before the vote after all amendments,
including some by members of the government majority, aimed at
strengthening the independence of the commission, were ruled out.


These included demands to redraw electoral boundaries and keep
the government out of compiling voters' rolls and drawing up
candidate lists.


The new commission's tasks will include overseeing preparatory
tasks to be carried out by the government, monitoring the
election campaign and drawing up the results from returns.


The opposition retaliated by calling on its supporters to boycott
the updating of electoral rolls begun last week.


Opposition politicians say the lists dating from the 2002
elections were fraudulently weighted in favour of Sassou Nguesso
and want a complete new census.


Most opposition candidates either pulled out or were excluded
from the last poll, which was marred by allegations of fraud.


Earlier this month Sassou Nguesso's ruling Congolese Workers'
Party sealed an electoral pact with the influential Congolese
Movement for Democracy and Development.


The pact is aimed at forming an "alliance ... which will have a
comfortable and stable majority in legislative, local, senate and
presidential elections."


The first round of legislative elections in the oil-rich country
will be held on June 24 with a second-round runoff on July 22.


Presidential elections are scheduled for 2009.
