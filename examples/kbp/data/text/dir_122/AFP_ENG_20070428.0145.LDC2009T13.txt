A historic fort thrown open to the  public in Indian Kashmir
after a gap of 17 years has been closed after Muslims alleged
that a mosque inside had been damaged, officials said on
Saturday.


"We have closed the fort to the public for the time being," a
state government official told AFP, asking not to be named.


Muslim visitors after it opened earlier this month said a Hindu
and a Sikh temple inside the 199-year-old fort overlooking
Srinagar, capital of revolt-hit Indian Kashmir, remained intact.


But they said the mosque inside the fort had been damaged.


On Friday, Muslims held noisy protests, accusing Indian
paramilitary forces who control the fort of damaging the mosque.


Authorities denied the allegations, saying the mosque had been in
a "dilapidated" state for a long time.


The Hari Parbat Fort, built in 1808 when Kashmir was under Afghan
rule, was closed after Muslim militants launched a deadly
separatist insurgency against New Delhi in 1989.


Authorities had feared the strategically located building
overlooking Srinagar could be misused by the rebels, who have
carried out bombings, suicide attacks and shootings in the city,
which is the urban hub of their activities.


The official said the entire fort, including the mosque, was now
being "renovated on a war footing."


The design of the fort, built by Afghan governor Atta Mohammed
Khan, is similar to those in Central Asia that are characterised
by small brick and stone work and it contains a series of small
apartments.


The fort's surrounding wall was constructed in the 16th century
by Mughal Emperor Akbar and the area served as an army
cantonment.
