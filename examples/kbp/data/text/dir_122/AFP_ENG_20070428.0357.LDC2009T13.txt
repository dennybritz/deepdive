Gretna completed a remarkable climb through the ranks of Scottish
football on Saturday when they clinched promotion to the Premier
League with a last-gasp 3-2 win over Ross County.


James Grady's second goal of the match ensured that Gretna topped
Division One by a point from St Johnstone and enjoyed a title
party for a third successive season.


The club, based in a village close to the border with England,
were admitted to senior football in Scotland in the summer of
2002 having previously played in a semi-professional league in
the north of England.


Their success has been bankrolled by self-made millionaire Brooks
Mileson but it is hard to see how it can be sustained.


The club's ground does not meet an SPL requirement for a minimum
6,000 capacity stadium and the current plan is for home games
next season to be played at Motherwell's Fir Park, which is a
two-hour drive from Gretna.
