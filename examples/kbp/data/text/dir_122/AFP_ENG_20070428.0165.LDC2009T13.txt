Three dead men were found aboard a small boat carrying some 80
would-be immigrants from Africa when it landed on the Spanish
Canary islands Saturday, local authorities said.


Several of the 78 survivors, who included four women, a baby and
an older child, were suffering from dehydration when the 14-metre
(46-foot) vessel arrived on the island of Gran Canaria.


All the occupants of the traditional fishing boat had come from
sub-Saharan Africa.


More than 31,000 illegal immigrants reached the Canary Islands,
seen as an outpost for entry into the European Union, from West
Africa last year, six times more than in 2005. Many others died
on the journey.


But tighter maritime surveillance and bad weather conditions have
led to a sharp drop in arrivals in the archipelago this year.
Only 1,525 migrants reached the Canary Islands during the first
three months of 2007, a 61 percent drop over the same time last
year.
