A bomber exploded his car on a main street in the Iraqi Shiite
shrine city of Karbala on Saturday, killing at least 10 people
and wounding 25 others, a security official said.


The bomber detonated the vehicle on Al-Abbas street in the city,
south of Baghdad, the official said.


The attack comes two weeks after a similar suicide bomb attack on
April 14 in Karbala that killed 42 people and wounded scores
more.
