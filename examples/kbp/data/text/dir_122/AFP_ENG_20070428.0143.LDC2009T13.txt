Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev will attend the funeral Sunday
of famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich in Moscow, officials here
said.


Rostropovich, who died Friday in Moscow at the age of 80, was
born in the Azerbaijani capital Baku in 1927, when the country
was still part of the Soviet Union.


Rostropovich maintained close links with the city throughout his
life. He returned often to perform here and donated family
heirlooms for the creation of the Rostropovich Home Museum in the
apartment where he was born.
