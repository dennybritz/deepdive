Pakistani security forces Saturday arrested a Saudi national
suspected of links to the Al-Qaeda terror network, police sources
said.


A police source said the suspect identified as Suleman Zakariya
was intercepted when he arrived in Zhob district in southwest
Pakistan from the neighbouring tribal district of Waziristan.


He had Saudi and US currency with him, the source said, without
disclosing the amount.


"Intelligence agencies are interrogating him," the police source
said.


Pakistan has arrested more than 700 suspects linked to Al-Qaeda
since the late 2001 ouster of the Taliban regime in neighbouring
Afghanistan.
