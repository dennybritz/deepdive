A French woman released by Afghanistan's Taliban Saturday made a
tearful appeal for the rebels to release four fellow hostages.


The aid worker, whose name has only been given as Celine, was
presented to international media at an emotional press conference
here hours after being set free in the southern province of
Kandahar.


She begged the rebels to free the Frenchman and three Afghans who
were also abducted in the southwestern province of Nimroz on
April 3.


Celine, her head covered in a shawl as the Taliban expects of
women, also read out a message from the Taliban to French
officials demanding the withdrawal of France's troops from
Afghanistan.


All five work for French non-governmental organisation, Terre
d'Enfance (A World For Our Children).


Celine also thanked the militants for treating her with respect.
