A sherpa guide fell to his death from Mount Everest, the world's
highest mountain, becoming its first victim of this year's
summiting season, officials said Saturday.


"Dawa Sherpa was killed after falling into a crevasse,"
Khadananda Dhakal, an official from Nepal's tourism ministry,
told AFP.


A brief window between the spring and summer monsoon season means
that most climbers tackle the 8,848-metre (29,198 feet) peak in
May.


Sherpa, 40, was working for an expedition led by Austrian
national Herbert Wolf and plunged to his death Thursday, said
Dhakal.


Last year's summiting season was one of the most deadly on
record, with 11 people killed on the Nepali south face and the
northern approach from Chinese- controlled Tibet.


This year around 550 people will attempt to reach the summit
first climbed in 1953 by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary.


Sherpas play a pivotal role in the industry that has sprung up
around taking paying clients to the highest point on earth.


While the term sherpa refers to an ethnic group, nowadays the
term applies to all those workers who support Himalayan
expeditions.


Every season, teams of high-altitude guides work on Mount
Everest, undertaking detailed preparations for summit attempts by
fee-paying foreign climbers.


Kilometres (miles) of rope need to be laid out, dozens of ladders
to bridge crevasses and tons of bottled oxygen and other
equipment have to be carried up to the four sites between base
camp and the summit.
