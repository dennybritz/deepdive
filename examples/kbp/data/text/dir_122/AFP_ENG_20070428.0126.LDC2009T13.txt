Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung will be sidelined until
August after undergoing knee surgery in the United States.


South Korean winger Park faces a race to be fit in time for the
start of next season after being operated on by knee specialist
Dr Richard Steadman, who helped save the careers of Alan Shearer
and Michael Owen.


The procedure, which was completed on Saturday morning, means
Park will also miss South Korea's Asia Cup campaign in July.


Park, who suffered the injury against Blackburn in March, will
now begin an extensive rehabilitation period before being
examined again later this year.


"Ji-sung Park has had a complicated cartilage operation that
required an expert in his field," a United spokesman said.


"He will be out for the remainder of the season and we will
assess the situation again in August."
