The Turkish government on Saturday lashed out at the army, which
accused it of endangering secularism, saying that the general
staff "remains under the orders of the prime minister."


"I would like to underline that it is inconceivable in a
democratic state based on the rule of law for the general staff,
which remains under the orders of the prime minister, to speak
out against the government," government spokesman Cemil Cicek
told a news conference here.


He stressed the government's commitment to the secular order of
the country and said it was "unacceptable" for Turkey to resolve
its problems outside the democratic system.


"The primary duty in protecting the basic tenets of the state
falls on the government," he said.
