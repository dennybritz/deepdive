Ricardo Carvalho has been ruled out of Chelsea's Champions League
semi-final second leg against Liverpool after suffering a knee
injury in his side's 2-2 draw with Bolton on Saturday.


The Portuguese defender hobbled off in the 30th minute after
sustaining the injury in a midfield collision and has been ruled
out of the crunch encounter at Anfield on Tuesday.


Jose Mourinho, Chelsea's manager, also suggested that the problem
could rule out his centre-half for the rest of the season, news
which will severely dent the club's ambitions both at home and in
Europe.


"It looks very bad," he said.


"How big a blow is it? He has been our best defender for the
whole season, it's as simple as that. We lost in Liverpool in the
Premiership without him and now we must go there without him
again.


"In that moment, we had to play with Paolo Ferreira at centre-
back but at least now we have better options in that area."
