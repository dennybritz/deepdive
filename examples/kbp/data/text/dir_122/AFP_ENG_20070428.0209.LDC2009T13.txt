At least 12 people were killed and a federal minister was among
several injured in a suicide blast at a political rally in
northwest Pakistan, police said Saturday.


The powerful explosion went off as Interior Minister Aftab
Sherpao was addressing the public gathering in the town of
Charsada in North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan.


The bomber detonated his explosives close to the speaker's
platform as the minister was making his speech, provincial police
chief Sharif Virk told reporters.


"Twelve people were killed and several others are wounded," Virk
said.


Local police officer Jehanzib Khan said the minister and his son
were among the injured.
