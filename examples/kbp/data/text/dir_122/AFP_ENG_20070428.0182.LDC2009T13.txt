Anthony Hamilton won the all English clash against Ian McCulloch
13-8 to seal his berth in the last eight at the snooker world
championships here on Saturday.


The pair were locked together at 8-8 before Hamilton reeled off
wins in the first five frames of Saturday's second session to
earn his first quarter-final appearance since 2004.


"The match was rubbish until halfway through but I enjoyed the
battle," the back to form world number 16 told the BBC.


Hamilton, who put together breaks of 111 and 107, added: "Ian is
such a rock- solid player who won't let go of you and I'm the
same, so you sort of sadistically enjoy those sort of games.


"But today was better. I can't remember the last session I played
here that was good. I've played rubbish here for three or four
years and it starts to get to you.


"I feel stronger this year and it doesn't feel like I've reached
a goal by getting to the quarters."


McCulloch, the world number 26 who defeated reigning champion
Graeme Dott in the opening round, reflected: "Personally I think
Anthony is different class to Graeme.


"He hasn't achieved as much but he's a far harder player to beat.
He's as hard as nails and if he starts scoring you've got your
hands full.


"I had chances and I'm not going to make excuses. I was beaten by
someone who played much better than me."
