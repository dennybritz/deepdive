A woman was killed Saturday and 24 other people wounded,
including women and children, in a grenade blast at a crowded bus
terminal in revolt-hit Indian Kashmir, police said.


"One woman died on the spot in the explosion," police officer
Farooq Ahmed said from Pampore, the scene of attack 15 kilometres
(10 miles) south of the state summer capital Srinagar.


He said suspected militants tossed a grenade at a bus carrying
activists from the pro-India National Conference back from a
rally.


"The grenade instead exploded on the ground after hitting the
bus," the officer said, adding that it sent shrapnel in all the
directions.


Earlier thousands of people had attended the rally called by
National Conference leader Omar Abdullah in Srinagar, urban hub
of the insurgency.


Kashmir is in the grip of a nearly 18-year-old revolt against
Indian rule that has so far left 42,000 dead by official count.
