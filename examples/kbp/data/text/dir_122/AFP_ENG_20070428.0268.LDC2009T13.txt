Once mighty English football giants Leeds United require a
miracle next weekend if they are not to slide into the English
third division or League Two after being held 1-1 by Ipswich Town
here on Saturday.


The former European Cup finalists - semi-finalists in the
Champions League only six years ago - were not helped by Cardiff
City's home defeat to Hull, who are three points clear of Leeds
with a better goal difference of nine going into the final match
of the campaign.


Leeds fans humour will not have been improved by the fact that
Cardiff's chairman Peter Ridsdale is the man who is blamed by
many for their decline as under his stewardship Leeds accrued
hugew and ultimately crippling debts forcing them to sell their
best players such as Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka and Alan Smith.


Only last season the three time English champions were one match
away from a stunning return to the Premiership but were beaten by
Watford in the play-off final.


However their present chairman Ken Bates lost patience with Kevin
Blackwell after a relatively indifferent start to the season this
term and sacked him claiming he should not have spoken about the
finances of the club.


Bates' appointment of former England international Denis Wise -
whose son Bates is godfather to - failed to spark a revival.
