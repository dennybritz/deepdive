A British woman who planned to settle in India was murdered
allegedly by a house guest in the seaside resort of Goa, police
said Saturday.


Police identified the victim as Denise Higgins of Oxfordshire and
said the 52 -year-old retired British civil servant had travelled
to India in 2006 and was living alone in a rented bungalow in
Goa's upscale Margao town.


She was stabbed repeatedly and her body was found late Friday by
local residents, police inspector Santosh Desai said in the state
capital Panaji.


Police Saturday arrested a Goan, Anand Kamble, and charged him
with fatally stabbing Higgins with a kitchen knife after being
invited to her home on Thursday.


"We arrested the suspect who was trying to leave Goa by train,
Desai told AFP and added Higgins was constructing a house in Goa
with plans of settling down permanently in the palm-fringed
Arabian Sea resort.


The motive for the killing was unclear, Desai said and added
Kamble arrived in Higgins' bungalow with his wife and daughter
and stayed back for the night after sending his family away.


More than 2.4 million tourists, including 300,000 foreigners,
visited the former Portuguese enclave last year.


Scores of Westerners have made Goa their home because of its
peaceful surroundings.
