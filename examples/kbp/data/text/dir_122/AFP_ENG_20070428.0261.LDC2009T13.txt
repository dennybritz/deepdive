A car bomb attack near a revered Shiite shrine in the central
Iraqi city of Karbala killed at least 30 people and wounded
another 50 on Saturday, a health ministry official said.


The blast erupted 200 metres (yards) from the shrine of Imam
Abbas, the second holiest shrine in Karbala, at 7:10 pm (1310
GMT), said Salim Kadhim, spokesman for the Karbala health
department.


An April 14 bomb attack in the city killed 42 people and wounded
scores more. That attack was close to the Imam Hussein shrine,
the most revered in Karbala.
