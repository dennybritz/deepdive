Nine people were killed including seven bystanders when a
military helicopter plunged into a busy street on the central
Philippine island of Cebu on Saturday, officials and radio
reports said.


Among those killed were two of the four man crew of the Vietnam-
era UH-1H "Huey" helicopter


The chopper was flying low returning from a training flight when
it crashed on a busy street in Lapu-Lapu City, said local air
force wing commander Colonel Butch Lacson.


Eyewitnesses were quoted in radio reports as saying the aircraft
got tangled in some power lines and crashed on an area where
motorised tricycles were picking up commuters, killing passengers
and drivers.


Lacson originally said the four military men on board were
injured in the crash but hospital officials later said two of the
crewmen had since died while the other two were in critical
condition.


The cause of the crash was still being investigated and all the
air force's UH- 1H helicopters have been grounded, Lacson said.


The poorly-equipped Philippine air force has suffered from
several aircraft crashes in recent years as much of its equipment
is already getting old.


Last December, an air force MG-520 helicopter gunship went down
in the southern Philippines, injuring two people aboard.
