The White House said Monday that it shared Britain's "concern and
outrage" over Iran's seizing 15 British sailors last week, as
Tehran defied intense international pressure for their release.


"We share the same concern and the outrage that (British) Prime
Minister (Tony) Blair has," spokeswoman Dana Perino told
reporters in some of the strongest US language since the tense
standoff began Friday.


"You can be assured that we are in close contact with our British
allies. We strongly support the message that Tony Blair sent
yesterday, the strong message of the hostage-taking being wrong
and unjustified," said Perino.
