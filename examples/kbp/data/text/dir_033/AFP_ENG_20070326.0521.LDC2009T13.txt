Matthew Hayden hopes his record-breaking century against South
Africa is the perfect response to critics who doubted his place
in the team.


Hayden smashed a 66-ball ton, the fastest in World Cup history,
to set up the crucial win against Graeme Smith's side in St
Kitts.


It was a win which also gave the defending champions an extra two
points to carry forward into their Super Eights campaign which
begins here on Tuesday against hosts West Indies.


"I wasn't in the side about six months ago," said Hayden.


"I'm just very grateful for the opportunity. I've really worked
hard over the last year and a half to get my position back.


"It's a pretty tough side to crack, this Australian side, but
once we're here, we really enjoy each others' company and we've
had a great couple of weeks."


Australia have been in fine form at the World Cup winning all
three of their Group A matches, scoring over 300 every time they
have gone into bat.


Skipper Ricky Ponting is overjoyed to see his top order in fine
form going into the second round.


"We are playing very good cricket," said Ponting.


"Our batting was terrific (against South Africa), Matty
(Hayden's) knock up front was unbelievable, Adam Gilchrist got us
off to a great start and Michael Clark was terrific as well so
377 was a good total on that wicket."
