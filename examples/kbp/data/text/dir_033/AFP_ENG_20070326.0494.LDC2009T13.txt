A new deal between the New Orleans Saints and state officials
will keep the National Football League team here through 2010,
the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported Monday.


The newspaper reported that the Saints reached a deal with
officials to remain in the Lousiana Superdome for the next four
seasons, eliminating contract escape clauses that could have let
the club relocate in the next year.


Damage caused by Hurricane Katrina forced the Saints to shift
training and home games to San Antonio, Texas, and nearby Baton
Rouge in 2005.


There was speculation Saints owner Tom Benson would try to make
the move to San Antonio permanent but NFL officials insisted the
team play a role in the recovery of the southern US city from the
devastating storm.


The Saints recovered from a woeful 2005 season by reaching the
playoffs in 2006, finishing one victory shy of a trip to their
first Super Bowl and sparking civic pride for a city still
struggling to shake off Katrina's damage.


The newspaper reported that the state of Louisiana eliminated its
2008 contract termination clause in the lease with the Saints and
promised further enhancements of the Superdome, damaged in the
horrific storm.


In exchange, the Saints dropped their termination clause that
could have allowed them out of their commitment this spring.
