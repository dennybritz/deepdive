Czech striker David Lafata said Monday that he will not be fit
for the midweek Euro 2008 qualifier against Cyprus because of a
lingering viral infection.


Lafata made his name by scoring a double in his debut for the
national side in their 2-1 European qualifying Group D win
against Wales last September.


The 25-year-old Austria Vienna player has four caps for the Czech
Republic.
