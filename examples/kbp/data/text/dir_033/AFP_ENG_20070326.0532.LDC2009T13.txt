A magnitude-5.5 earthquake struck off Indonesia's Sulawesi island
Monday, geologists said.


The quake struck at 12:51 am (1651 GMT), 130 kilometres (80
miles) southeast of Manado, the US Geological Survey said.


The USGS said the quake struck at a depth of 10 km.


There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where
continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and volcanic
activity.
