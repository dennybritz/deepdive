Rasheed Wallace scored 22 points, including a buzzer-beating shot
from beyond halfcourt, as the undermanned Detroit Pistons held on
for a 113-109 overtime win over Denver on Monday.


Wallace made his return to the hardwood for the Pistons after
serving an one- game suspension following his 18th technical in a
loss at San Antonio on March 23.


At the end of regulation, Tayshaun Prince tipped away the inbound
pass intended for All-Star Carmelo Anthony, setting up Wallace's
game-tying 3-pointer off the glass from three-quarter court as
the buzzer sounded to force the extra session.


In overtime, Allen Iverson fed Nene for an alley-oop as the
Nuggets grabbed a 106-103 advantage with 1:04 remaining. But
Wallace drained a tying 3-pointer from the top of the key.


After Prince picked off Iverson's pass, reserve Antonio McDyess
made 1-of-2 free throws and Wallace added two more from the line
to extend the lead to three points with 18 seconds left.


The Pistons were without All-Star Richard Hamilton and fellow
starter Chris Webber due to the flu bug that has hit Detroit's
locker room.
