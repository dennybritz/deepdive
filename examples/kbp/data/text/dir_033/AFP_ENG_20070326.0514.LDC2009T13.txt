A US military judge opened a hearing here on Monday for
Australian David Hicks, who is to be formally charged with
supporting terrorism by a special military tribunal.


The pretrial hearing began at 2:11 pm (1811 GMT) under elaborate
security at the remote US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, southeast
Cuba, where some 385 terror suspects are held outside the
jurisdiction of regular US courts.


Hicks is the first "war on terror" detainee at the prison to be
tried under a new law that revived the tribunals after the US
Supreme Court threw out the previous system as unconstitutional.


Hicks was brought into the chamber in khaki prison garb, his hair
long to his chest but clean-shaven. He was visibly heavier than
in old photographs.


No cameras were allowed inside the tribunal chamber as military
judge Colonel Ralph Kohlmann convened the hearing.
