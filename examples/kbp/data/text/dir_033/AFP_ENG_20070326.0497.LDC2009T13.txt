The European Union could introduce a common consolidated
corporate tax base by 2010 in at least 12 of its 27 member
states, the EU commissioner responsible for taxes and customs
said here Monday.


The aim of having an EU common consolidated corporate tax base is
to give companies with a presence in more than one member state a
single set of rules to compute their group taxable income.


It would overcome what the EU describes on its website as "the
fundamental problem of dealing with up to 27 different tax
systems."


EU Commissioner Lazslo Kovacs said 12 EU members currently
strongly support a proposal to introduce a harmonized tax base,
five to seven are against, and the remainder are undecided.


"I hope we would be able to present a proposal to the Commission
next year, and if we manage to get a decision on 'enhanced
cooperation', another two years would be enough for
implementation. So it could start working in 2010," Kovacs told
reporters here.


The EU's so-called enhanced cooperation procedure does not
require unanimous approval by all member states, but at least
eight states must be involved.


"There should be nearly two-thirds participating and the door
will be left open for others who wish to participate," Kovacs
said of proposals to harmonise the corporate tax base.


He stressed that the Commission does not aim to harmonise
corporate tax across the 27-member bloc.


"We want to maintain the sovereignty of member states as far as
setting tax rates is concerned," the commissioner said.
