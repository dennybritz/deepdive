Jamaican police investigating the murder of Pakistan's cricket
coach Bob Woolmer are searching for three of the team's fans who
spent a great deal of time with the players, The Times reported
in an early edition of its Tuesday paper.


"We are looking for them to eliminate them (from our enquiries),"
Mark Shields, deputy police commissioner, was quoted as saying by
the daily.


The three reportedly were close to the players and appeared with
them at press conferences and after matches. The paper said they
are believed to have left Jamaica shortly after Woolmer was found
dead on March 18.


The 58-year-old was found unconscious in his hotel room, and
declared dead hours later.


His death came just one day after a stunning defeat to debutants
Ireland, which knocked Pakistan out of the World Cup, stirring
speculation match-fixing gangs may have been involved in the
murder.


According to The Times, Jamaican police are anxious to speak to
the three because of the ready access they had to the team before
Woolmer's death, and were not singling them out for special
attention.


The three are all Pakistanis and were identified by The Times as
Hamid Malik, Jundie Khan and Efran Chaudhray.
