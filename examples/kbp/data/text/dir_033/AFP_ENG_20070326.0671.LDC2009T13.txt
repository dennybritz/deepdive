Hong Kong share prices opened slightly lower Tuesday following
weak US new home sales data, which triggered fresh concerns that
the world's largest economy may be slowing more than expected,
dealers said.


The recent uptrend in crude oil prices is also prompting
investors to take a cautious stance, they added.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index opened down 16.04 points at
19,749.81.
