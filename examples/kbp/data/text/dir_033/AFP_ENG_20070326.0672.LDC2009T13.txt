A Russian diving coach faced an Australian court Tuesday charged
with groping a female security guard at the Melbourne hotel where
he is staying during the FINA World Swimming Championships.


Vladimir Rulev appeared before Melbourne Magistrates Court
charged with indecent assault and unlawful assault over the
incident at the city centre Mercure Hotel on Saturday night.


The court was told Rulev, 56, was drunk when he squeezed the
security guard's breast as she and the hotel's night manager
escorted him to his room.


"The victim was upset and pushed the defendant away. He then took
hold of the victim's accreditation around her neck and pulled it,
causing some pain in her neck," police prosecutor Glenn Taylor.


Rulev's lawyers said he denied the allegations and magistrate
Paul Smith granted bail and adjourned the case until April 2
after the Russian surrendered his passport.


The Sydney Morning Herald reported that in the lead-up to the
championships, a 14-year-old Russian swimmer was caught
shoplifting at a Melbourne shopping centre but was allowed to
compete after receiving a police caution.
