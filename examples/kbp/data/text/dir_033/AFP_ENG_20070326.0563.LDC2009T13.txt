With the eyes of the world on "Cute Knut" the polar bear cub, one
of Berlin zoo's other main attractions, a 22-year-old female
panda named Yan Yan, died unexpectedly on Monday, the zoo said.


Yan Yan, meaning "beautiful" in Chinese, had lived at the zoo in
the German capital since 1995 and was found dead Monday despite
having shown no signs of being ill. Life expectancy for pandas is
normally around 34.


Yan Yan was sent to Berlin in the hope that she would produce
offspring with the zoo's mascot Bao Bao, who at 26 is the world's
oldest panda in captivity, but she died without bearing cubs.


Heiner Kloes, one of Yan Yan's keepers, who has had his hands
full caring for Knut, was said to be devastated by the news.


Knut has become a global sensation after surviving rejection by
his mother. He made his first public appearance at Berlin Zoo
Friday under the gaze of the world's media.


The nine-kilogram (19-pound) bear has triggered a wave of media
coverage in recent days after an animal activist said he should
have been put down after he and his brother were spurned by their
mother following their birth in December.
