Tamil Tiger rebels detonated a tractor and trailer packed with
explosives in an army camp in eastern Sri Lanka on Tuesday,
causing heavy casualties, a military official told AFP.


The vehicle crashed into the Chenkaladi army camp in Batticaloa
district, where government forces have been conducting intensive
operations against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).


"Several vehicles have rushed to evacuate the casualties from the
army camp," a military official in Batticaloa said.


The attack came a day after Tamil Tigers carried out their first
ever air raid, bombing a military airbase beside Sri Lanka's
international airport.
