World number one Justine Henin of Belgium advanced to the
quarter-finals of the WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt
tournament with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Russia's Vera Zvonareva
here Monday.


Henin, the second seed behind Russian Maria Sharapova, advanced
to face Russian sixth seed Nadia Petrova, who rallied to
eliminate compatriot Dinara Safina 3-6, 6-2, 6-4.


On the men's side of the 6.9 million-dollar tournament, Russian
fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko was eliminated by American Amer
Delic.


The US qualifier dumped Davydenko 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to book a date
in the round of 16 against the winner of a later match between
Czech Tomas Berdych and Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela.


Also advancing in an early third-round match was Spanish sixth
seed Tommy Robredo, who ousted Germany's Florian Meyer 6-4, 6-4.


Robredo's fourth-round math will be against Czech Radek Stepanek,
who eliminated Colombian lucky loser Alejandro Falla 6-3, 6-2.


Women were scheduled to conclude their third round later Monday
when Australian Open champion Serena Williams will play Czech
Lucie Safarova in a match postponed from Sunday by rain.


A victory would send the US star against Sharapova in a rematch
of their January championship final Grand Slam showdown from
Melbourne.
