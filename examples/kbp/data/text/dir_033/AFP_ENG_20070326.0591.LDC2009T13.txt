Indy-car rookie racer Pablo Perez, hurt in a crash during a
developmental series race at the weekend, underwent more surgery
here Monday for severe leg injuries.


Michael Olinger, Indy Racing League director of medical services,
said in a statement that the Argentine driver was progressing as
expected following the latest operation at Jackson Memorial
Hospital.


Doctors also operated on Perez on Saturday, although it was
unclear how extensive the surgery had been.


Tentative plans were to transfer Perez to Methodist Hospital in
Indianapolis for direct care under series orthopedic consultant
Kevin Scheid, possibly as quickly as Tuesday, Olinger said.


Perez, 24, was injured in a multi-car accident on lap 47 of the
Miami 100 race at the Homestead Miami oval, the opening race of
the Indy-car developmental series season.
