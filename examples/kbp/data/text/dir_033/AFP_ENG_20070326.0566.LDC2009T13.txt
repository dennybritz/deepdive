European aircraft maker Airbus is seeking orders for its new A380
superjumbo from US airlines that run long haul flights to Asia, a
top Airbus executive said Monday.


Airbus has no US customers yet for its plane, the largest
passenger jet in the world.


However Allan McArtor, the chairman of Airbus North America, is
optimistic that United Airlines or Northwest Airlines might be
persuaded to place orders for the jet, which can be configured to
carry up to 845 passengers.


"We consider United and Northwest to be the logical carriers
between the United States and the Pacific Rim," McArtor told AFP
following a demonstration to reporters of the A380's in-flight
capabilities here.


McArtor said that Delta Airlines, which partners with Air France,
does not appear to be interested in purchasing either the A380 or
rival Boeing's 747 jet.


Airbus has flown its A380 to the United States for a series of
high profile marketing trips in the past week, including a
stopover near the US capital Monday.


McArtor said executives from United and Northwest flew on the
aircraft Monday, but that "there was nothing firm yet" regarding
possible orders.


Singapore Airlines will be the first carrier to take delivery of
one of the vast Airbus jets in October.


Initially scheduled for delivery in 2006, a series of production
setbacks including problems with the plane's wiring, have delayed
the A380's readiness.


Airbus, who had hoped the A380 would outsell Boeing's 747, has
166 firm and tentative orders for its jet from 15 buyers.
