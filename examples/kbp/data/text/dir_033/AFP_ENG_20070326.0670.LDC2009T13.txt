Federalists won a close election in French-speaking Quebec
Monday, dashing separatists' hopes of holding a referendum on
breaking away from Canada, said public broadcaster Radio-Canada.


According to projections, the federalist Liberals won 45 seats in
Quebec's 125-seat National Assembly, followed by the greenhorn
conservative Action Democratique du Quebec (ADQ) with 42 seats
and the separatist Parti Quebecois with 38.


At the start of the campaign in late February, analysts believed
Liberal Premier Jean Charest would win a second term and stave
off a plebiscite on Quebec independence for five years, a
prescribed term.


But the separatist Parti Quebecois, which vowed to hold a
referendum if it won the election, made great strides in the
final stretch.


And an unexpected surge in support for the greenhorn conservative
Action Democratique du Quebec (ADQ), which favors greater
autonomy for Quebec but not independence, turned the contest into
a three-way race.


Losing his majority, Charest would now face pressure to resign as
party leader.


As well, a minority Liberal government leaves the door open a
crack to an early election and a possible vote on Quebec
independence thereafter, with hostile separatists and Quebec
nationalists in opposition.


Quebec held referendums on seceding from Canada in 1980 and 1995.
Federalists led by Jean Charest narrowly won the second ballot.
