The US Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider whether a law
banning the promotion of pedophilia is compatible with the US
constitutional right to free speech.


In 2002, the highest US court threw out a law, passed in 1996,
banning the production of images of "virtual" children engaged in
sex acts. The following year another similar law, while less
restrictive, was passed.


In April 2004, a police officer set a trap for a man, Michael
Williams, who took part in a pedophilia chat room on the
Internet. Once arrested, Williams was convicted of possessing
such images, and for promotion of pedophilia, a crime under the
new legislation.


On appeal Williams saw his sentence of five years in jail at
first upheld and then thrown out over the issue of "promotion,"
as the new law was judged potentially too restrictive of freedom
of speech.


The high court on Monday agreed to take up the issue later this
year.
