At least two soldiers were killed when Tamil Tiger rebels
detonated a tractor and trailer packed with explosives at an army
camp in eastern Sri Lanka on Tuesday, a military official told
AFP.


The vehicle crashed into the Chenkaladi army camp in Batticaloa
district, where government forces have been conducting intensive
operations against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).


"Several vehicles have rushed to evacuate the casualties from the
army camp," a military official in Batticaloa said, adding that
at least two soldiers were killed and two more wounded.


The attack came a day after Tamil Tigers carried out their first
ever air raid, bombing a military airbase beside Sri Lanka's
international airport. Three airmen were killed and 16 wounded in
that attack.


Tuesday's suicide attack against the Chenkaladi camp came six
days after it resisted a major Tiger artillery attack.


The Chenkaladi camp was attacked last week together three other
military camps in the coastal Batticaloa district leaving a total
of four soldiers dead and 30 wounded, according to the military.


There was no immediate word from the Tigers about the latest
attack.


Relief workers raised concerns for the safety of civilians in
Batticaloa as more people fled their homes and sought the safety
of public buildings to avoid getting caught in the cross fire
between troops and rebels.


The fighting comes despite a truce in place since February 2002.


More than 60,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's Tamil
separatist campaign since 1972.
