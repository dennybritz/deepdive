Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd on Monday warned England boss
Steve McClaren against rushing striker Michael Owen back from
injury to lift his Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.


Owen injured his knee playing for England in the 2006 World Cup
in Germany.


And the 27-year-old is targetting a return from cruciate ligament
damage before the end of the season, and could line out for
England's game against Estonia in June.


"He will return when it suits him and Newcastle, not England,"
Shepherd told the Newcastle Chronicle.


"If he's not fit for Newcastle this season, he won't be fit for
England."


McClaren's side have scored only once in five international
matches and Saturday's draw in Israel left England five points
behind Croatia, the pacesetters in their Euro 2008 qualifying
group, and three adrift of Russia, who currently occupy the
second qualifying spot.


Shepherd added: "I am an England fan and I want to watch them in
the Euro 2008 finals.


"But let's stop this clamour for Michael returning to play for
England before it gets up a head of steam.


"The player and Newcastle United come first and he will not be
rushed back just so he can play for England in the summer."
