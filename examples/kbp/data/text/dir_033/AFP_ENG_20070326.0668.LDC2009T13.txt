Defenceman Jack Johnson is close to signing a contract with the
National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings, the Los Angeles Times
reported on Monday.


The 20-year-old American could join the Kings for their final
half dozen games of the 2006-07 regular season if he signs.


Johnson was a member of the United States team that competed in
the last two World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He was the
Kings first pick, third overall, in the 2005 NHL entry draft.


"I'm hangin loose to see if it gets worked out in time," Johnson
told the newspaper. "But I am looking forward to heading west."


Johnson had 16 goals and 21 assists in 35 games this season for
the American university's Michigan Wolverines.
