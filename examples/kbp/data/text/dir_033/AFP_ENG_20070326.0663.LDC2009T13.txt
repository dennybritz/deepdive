Israeli troops on Tuesday shot dead two Palestinian militants
during an exchange of gunfire in the West Bank city of Nablus,
Palestinian security sources said.


Both of those killed, Mohammad Mreesh and Alla Ghaleed, were
members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades close to the Fatah movement
of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, the sources said.


The deaths bring to 5,650 the number of people killed since the
start of the intifada or uprising in September 2000, most of them
Palestinians, according to an AFP count.
