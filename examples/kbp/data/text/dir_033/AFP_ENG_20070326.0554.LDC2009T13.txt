US shares ended mixed Monday after a government report showed new
homes sales dived to a near seven-year low last month spelling
further bad news for the troubled housing sector.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 11.86 points (0.10
percent) at 12,469.15 just after the closing bell. The Dow,
however, had managed to recover somewhat from earlier lows.


The Nasdaq composite added 6.70 points (0.27 percent) to 2,455.63
while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 rose a slight 1.34
points (0.09 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,437.45.


Most analysts had been expecting the housing report to reveal a
increase in new home sales last month, but the Commerce
Department said that sales fell 3.9 percent in February, hitting
the lowest level since June 2000.


Stocks fell heavily in the wake of the report's release, but
showed some signs of recovery in afternoon trading.


"New home sales were much lower than expected," said Peter
Cardillo, an analyst at Avalon Partners.


"It's weighting on the market because there are fears that the
economy is slowing too much and that it could be negative for
corporate earnings," Cardillo said.
