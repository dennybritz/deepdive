French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen cames close to
confirming Monday what commentators had suspected, announcing
that this, his fifth presidential campaign, would probably be his
last.


Asked by French television station iTele if this was his last
attempt to secure the top job in French politics, the 79-year old
replied: "Probably."


But he added: "As long as I have the strength to fight, I will
fight."


And he said he was aiming for a second successive appearance in
the second-round run-off for the presidential election, scheduled
for May 6 after April 22's first round.


The head of the National Front became a force to be reckoned with
in French politics when he qualified for the runoff vote in the
2002 election against Jacques Chirac, seeing off Socialist Lionel
Jospin in the first round.


A former Foreign Legionnaire who served as an intelligence
officer in Algeria and as a paratrooper in Indochina, Le Pen has
been the champion of the far right for 35 years, calling for an
end to immigration and a halt to European integration.
