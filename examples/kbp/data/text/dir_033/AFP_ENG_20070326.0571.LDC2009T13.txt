The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday told online
video-sharing group YouTube to remove World Cup clips claiming
copyright infringement, it was reported here.


ICC Development, the body's commercial arm, and commercial rights
holder the Global Cricket Corporation, have gone after YouTube to
protect the rights of broadcast and sponsorship partners.


"We are here to protect the commercial broadcast rights for the
ICC and GCC and there is an issue here," Christopher Stokes, the
chief executive of online rights protection agency NetResult,
which represents the ICC, told The Guardian newspaper.


"In general there is a dilemma for rights holders in that they
want people to enjoy the event but also have stringent contracts
with TV broadcasters and with mobile rights holders.


"In today's world, broadcasters buy highlights as well as live
coverage and mobile rights means clips. There is an obligation to
protect them."
