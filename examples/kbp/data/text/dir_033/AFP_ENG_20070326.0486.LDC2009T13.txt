Russian fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko was eliminated by US
qualifier Amer Delic here Monday in a third-round match at the
6.9 million-dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt
tournament.


Delic dumped Davydenko 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to book a date in the round
of 16 against the winner of a later match between Czech Tomas
Berdych and Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela.


Also advancing in an early third-round match Monday was Czech
Radek Stepanek, who eliminated Colombian lucky loser Alejandro
Falla 6-3, 6-2.


Next up for Stepanek will be the winner of a later match between
Germany's Florian Meyer and Spanish sixth seed Tommy Robredo.


Women were scheduled to conclude their third round later Monday
when Australian Open champion Serena Williams will play Czech
Lucie Safarova in a match postponed from Sunday by rain.


A victory would send the US star against Russian top seed Maria
Sharapova in a rematch of their January championship final Grand
Slam showdown from Melbourne.
