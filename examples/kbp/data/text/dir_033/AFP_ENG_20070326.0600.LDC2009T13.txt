The US magazine LIFE, which published the work of some of the
best known 20th century photographers, will close after a brief
reincarnation as a newspaper insert, its publishers announced
Monday.


Time Inc. however said in a statement that it will continue to
develop LIFE online and operate the brand's other businesses,
which include books.


"With the decline in the newspaper business, and the outlook for
advertising growth in the newspaper supplement category, the
response was not strong enough to warrant further investment in
LIFE as a weekly newspaper supplement," the statement read.


The final issue of the print edition will appear on April 20.


LIFE however "will continue with its plan to launch a major
portal to put its entire collection of 10 million images online,"
the statement added.


Starting in 1936 the weekly LIFE published the work of legendary
photographers, including Robert Capa, Alfred Eisenstaedt and
Margaret Bourke-White.


It ceased publication in 1972, and returned as a monthly from
1978 to 2000. It then came back in 2004 as a smaller, slimmed-
down weekly supplement, appearing in papers such as the Los
Angeles Times, the Miami Herald, and the Washington Post.
