Japanese share prices fell 0.12 percent Tuesday morning on fresh
concern over the US housing sector after new home sales in the
world's largest economy dived to a near seven-year low, dealers
said.


But losses were contained amid general caution ahead of a slew of
Japanese economic data out later this week, they said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index of leading
shares fell 21.59 points to 17,500.37 at the lunch break, barely
holding the 17,500-point level, after five days of gains.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section slipped 5.32 points or 0.31 percent to 1,736.05.
