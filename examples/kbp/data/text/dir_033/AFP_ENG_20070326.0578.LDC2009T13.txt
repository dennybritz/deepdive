Three young movie stars who played the trio of teen wizards in
the first two "Harry Potter" films have signed on to continue
their roles in the last two big- screen installments, reports
said Monday.


Daniel Radcliffe, who plays the bespectacled wizard, and his
cohorts Rupert Grint and Emma Watson signed on despite
speculation they may outgrow their child characters by the time
the movies are made, the Hollywood Reporter said.


"It would be inconceivable to imagine anyone else in the roles
with which they have become so identified," said Warner Brothers
Pictures' chief of production Jeff Robinov.


Radcliffe, who began playing Harry at age 12, will turn 18 in
July. Watson is 16, and Grint is 18.


The final two movies of author J.K. Rowling's mega-selling series
are to be titled "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" and
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."


The trio has been in the series since its first installment in
2001, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."
