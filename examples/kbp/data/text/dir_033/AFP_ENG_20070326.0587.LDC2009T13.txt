The 15 British naval personnel being held by Iran are being
questioned by the Revolutionary Guards in Tehran, the BBC
reported Monday.


Citing a highly-placed Iranian source, the broadcaster said the
group was being questioned to see if its mission was related to
intelligence-gathering.


The source told the BBC that the interrogations could take a
minimum of some days.


A British foreign ministry spokeswoman could not confirm the
report.


Britain says the eight sailors and seven marines were conducting
"routine" anti- smuggling operations in the Shatt al-Arab
waterway in the north of the Gulf on Friday. Iran says they had
intruded into Iranian waters.


London has called in the Iranian ambassador three times for
discussions.


Britain's ambassador to Tehran Geoffrey Adams, who held more
talks at the foreign ministry in Tehran earlier Monday, was
assured that the group was "fit and well," the Foreign Office
said in London.


Baghdad also backed up Britain's claim that the 14 men and one
women were taken in Iraqi waters in the Shatt al-Arab waterway
that divides the two countries.
