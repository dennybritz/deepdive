Mike Sullivan, a former Boston Bruins coach who served as an
assistant on the 2006 US Olympic ice hockey team, was named
Monday to coach the 2007 US world championship squad.


An American lineup of players whose clubs have no chance to win
the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup playoffs will compete
for the world crown April 27 to May 13 at Moscow.


Sullivan, an 11-year NHL veteran who scored 54 goals in 709 games
before retiring in 2002, guided the Bruins from 2003 through
2005, including a division title in 2004.


"It's always an honor and a privilege to represent your country,"
Sullivan said. "I feel very fortunate to have this opportunity
and can't wait until the games begin."


Barry Smith, associate coach under retired legend Wayne Gretzky
of the NHL Phoenix Coyotes, will serve the same role on the US
squad. David Quinn, an assistant coach at Boston University, will
have that role on the US team.


A USA Hockey advisory group of four NHL team general managers
assembled the group.
