The president of Japan's struggling electronics maker Sanyo will
step down, two weeks after the firm's chairwoman also quit amid
window-dressing allegations, a newspaper said Tuesday.


Toshimasa Iue, a member of the family that founded Sanyo making
bicycle lamps after World War II, will quit on April 1, the
Yomiuri Shimbun said, without identifying its sources.


A company spokesman declined to comment but added: "Nothing has
been decided on the matter."


The Osaka-based company has been slashing thousands of jobs in a
restructuring drive as it tries to revive sales.


Last year, Sanyo issued 2.6 billion dollars' worth of new shares
to Goldman Sachs, Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking, which together took five of the nine seats on Sanyo's
board.


The Yomiuri said Goldman Sachs, now the firm's top shareholder,
has clashed with Iue on how to restore the firm's flagging
fortunes.


It also said that some questioned Iue's role as he was the
company's vice president during alleged accounting irregularities
that are now being investigated by the government.


Sanyo Electric last week announced the resignation of its
chairwoman Tomoko Nonaka, one of Japan's highest-profile female
executives.


Nonaka -- a former television journalist with no previous
experience in corproate management -- was brought in two years
ago in a surprise move to shake up the company.


Japanese media said she quit because she wanted the Sanyo board
to more fully probe the accounting irregularities. Sanyo denied
the report, saying only that she resigned for personal reasons.
