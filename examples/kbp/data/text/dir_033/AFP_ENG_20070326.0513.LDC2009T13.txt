West Indies skipper Brian Lara said on Monday that the players
owe it to the memory of Bob Woolmer to ensure the World Cup
becomes a tournament to remember.


As the World Cup gets ready to kick-off the second round Super
Eight stage on Tuesday, with Lara's West Indies taking on
defending champions Australia here, the investigation into the
murder of the 58-year-old Pakistan coach in Jamaica last weekend
goes on.


"It's important for the teams and the officials involved to
ensure that the World Cup continues in the same vein that it set
out at the beginning," said Lara.


"The circumstances are unfortunate but I am sure that the
Jamaican officials will ensure that things are handled correctly
and get to the bottom of everything," said Lara who played under
Woolmer when the former England Test player was coach at
Warwickshire.


"But as cricketers, we have to make sure that we play the game to
the best of our ability and ensure the World Cup is a success
because that's what he would have wanted us to do."
