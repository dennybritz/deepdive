A terror suspect in a 2002 missile attack on an Israeli airliner
and the bombing of a tourist hotel in Kenya has been captured in
East Africa and transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a Pentagon
spokesman said Monday.


Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman identified the man as Abdul
Malik, who he said has admitted to participation in the 2002
Paradise Hotel attack in Mombassa that killed 13, and in the
attempted shootdown of an Israeli airliner also at Mombassa.


"He was captured as a result of our ongoing armed conflict
against Al Qaeda and was involved in terrorist attacks in East
Africa," Whitman said.
