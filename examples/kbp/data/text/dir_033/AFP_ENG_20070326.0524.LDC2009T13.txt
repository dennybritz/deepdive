Police arrested more than 100 activists in Belarus ahead of last
weekend's protest rally, opposition leaders reported Monday --
and one woman told AFP she had been taken to a psychiatric
hospital.


The website of opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich said that
half the activists were arrested on Saturday, a day before the
planned rally, and the other half on the Sunday.


And opposition activist Kristina Shatikova told AFP that plain-
clothed officers had forcibly taken to a psychiatric hospital in
the town of Mogilyov on Saturday to prevent her attending the
rally.


An interior ministry official said no arrests were made during
the protest on Sunday but declined to say whether arrests had
been made before or after the rally.


At least 1,500 opposition activists rallied in Minsk on Sunday
against Lukashenko's authoritarian rule.


Earlier, dozens of activists were beaten back by police and
paratroopers to prevent them entering a city centre square.
