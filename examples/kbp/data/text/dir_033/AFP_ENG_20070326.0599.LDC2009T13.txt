Rebels in Ivory Coast said on Monday that their leader, Guillaume
Soro, has been appointed prime minister following a peace accord
signed earlier this month.


The news was confirmed by an official in neighbouring Burkina
Faso, where representatives of the Ivorian President Laurent
Gbagbo met for talks with the rebels last week.


"Soro has been appointed prime minister," said the official who
asked not to be named.


"This decision will be confirmed by a decree signed by the head
of state Laurent Gbagbo in the next few hours," said a statement
on the rebel group's website.


The news comes after the March 4 peace accord between Soro's
rebels and President Gbagbo in Ouagadougou, the capital of
neighbouring Burkina Faso.


That agreement provided for the appointment of a new prime
minister to succeed Charles Konan Banny and the formation of a
new government.


Konan Banny, who was appointed prime minister by the
international community in 2005, in a speech earlier Monday at
the central town of Yamoussoukro, said he was ready to resign in
the interests of his country.


Soro led an abortive coup against Gbagbo in 2002, triggering a
brief civil war that has left the west African country divided
ever since.
