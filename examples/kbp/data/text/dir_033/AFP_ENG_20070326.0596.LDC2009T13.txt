Georgia said on Monday it had filed a lawsuit with the European
Court of Human Rights over the expulsion of thousands of its
nationals from Russia in 2006.


The suit "is based on serious violations of the rights of
thousands of Georgian citizens and ethnic Georgians in their
expulsion from Russia," a spokesman for the Georgian justice
ministry said.


Relations have been rocky between Moscow and Tbilisi since 2003,
when the pro- Western Mikheil Saakashvili came to power in
Georgia.


They hit a new low when Tbilisi arrested four Russian army
officers on suspicion of spying in late September.


This prompted Moscow to withdraw its ambassador, impose financial
sanctions against its southern neighbour and deport hundreds of
Georgians.


"Identical gestures on the part of Tbilissi do not favour the
normalisation of our bilateral relations which Russia aspires
to," a spokesman for Russia's foreign ministry said.
