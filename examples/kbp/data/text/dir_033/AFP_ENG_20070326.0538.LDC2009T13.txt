The US Marine Corps said Monday it will involuntarily recall
1,200 marine reservists to active duty to meet requirements of
the "war on terrorism."


The elite force has so far had to involuntarily recall only 69
members of the marine individual ready reserve.


But the Marine Corps said it plans to issue recall orders to up
to 2,500 members of the individual ready reserve "to fill
critical manpower requirements in support of the Global War on
Terrorism."


It said 1,800 reservists were notified this month that they are
being considered for recall to active duty.


"It is expected that 1,200 of those notified will receive active
duty orders," the marines said.
