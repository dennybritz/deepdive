Failure to approve funding for Italy's 2,000 troops in
Afghanistan would be "shameful," Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema
said Monday ahead of a crunch Senate vote on the issue.


He was speaking ahead of Tuesday's vital vote on the issue, which
last month forced Prime Minister Romano Prodi to resign after he
failed to get backing over his foreign policy.


"I don't even want to think about it ... I hope that in the end,
after all the polemic, reason will prevail for a majority of
senators," he told the Ansa news agency.


Prodi's government has only a two-vote majority in the Senate and
the subject of funding for Italy's foreign military operations,
particularly in Afghanistan, is a source of contention within his
centre-left coalition.


Far-left parties in Prodi's coalition oppose both the Afghanistan
deployment and the enlargement of a US military base in northern
Italy.


Tuesday's vote involves financing for all of Italy's military
missions abroad, including Afghanistan, Lebanon and Bosnia.


Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of Forza Italia and the rightwing
opposition, said Monday that his party would abstain on the vote.


But he has said that if Prodi needs the support of the opposition
Christian Democrat UDC party, he would have to dissolve his
government and resign.


Prodi has not made the vote an issue of confidence and so
technically speaking, he would be under no obligation to do so.


But he since being reinstated as premier after losing the last
vote on the issue, his position remains delicate.
