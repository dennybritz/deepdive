Australian David Hicks pleaded guilty to a charge of supporting
terrorism on Monday before a US military tribunal.


Hicks's military attorney entered the plea on behalf of his
client, who stood alongside with a somber expression. Hicks has
been held more than five years at the US-run prison in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba.
