London is planning to invest in sending a satellite into space to
cut out the need for mobile phone masts and possibly monitor
motorists from space, local authorities confirmed Monday.


The British capital is set to spend 12 million pounds (24 million
dollars, 18 million euros) on the satellite project after the
London Development Agency (LDA) board voted "overwhelmingly" in
favour of giving backing to Inmarsat.


The southeast and eastern England regional bodies are also
putting in 12 million pounds.


Inmarsat, the firm behind the scheme already has several
satellites in orbit.


"We are keen to get involved in this from the beginning," said a
spokesman from the LDA, which is responsible for developing
London's economy.


"It is important to stay at the forefront of new technology," he
added.


But Bob Blackman, economic development spokesman for the
Conservatives on the London Assembly, said: "This is an utter
waste of taxpayers' money."


"The satellite, due to be launched in 2011, would have the
capacity to handle mobile and Internet communications -- but
worryingly for motorists around the country, could be used to
monitor drivers from space," he said.


Inner London is already surrounded by a ring of security cameras
checking whether motorists driving in have paid the eight-pound
(15.80-dollar, 11.80-euro) levy.


The launch, on a European Space Agency rocket, is being earmarked
for French Guiana.
