Ukraine hopes to raise at least a billion dollars (750 million
euros) by listing 37.86 percent of its fixed-line public
telecommunications operator Ukrtelecom on the London Stock
Exchange, a spokeswoman said Monday.


"Our experts believe it will be more profitable to do this on the
London Exchange," fund spokeswoman Nina Yavorska told AFP. The
government hoped to earn "at least one billion dollars", she
added.


A statement on the website of the State Property Fund of Ukraine
said 50 percent plus one share would remain the property of the
state.


Another 37.86 percent would be listed for sale on the
international exchanges between August 1 and December 31 2007.


A decision whether to sell the 37.68 percent holding in one stake
or more had not yet been made, the spokeswoman said.


Ukrtelecom posted sales in 2006 of 1.56 billion dollars and a
profit of 93 million. It holds 80 percent of the market for fixed
line telecommunications in Ukraine with 9.7 million subscribers.
