Chinese retail sales rose 16.9 percent in February from the same
month a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday.


Retail sales, the main measure for consumer spending, hit 701.4
billion yuan (91 billion dollars) during the month, the bureau
said in a statement posted on its website.


The bureau earlier announced that retail sales rose 14.7 percent
in the first two months of 2007 compared with a year earlier.
Retail sales expanded 13.7 percent in full-year 2006.


China's economic planning agency has said it expects retail sales
growth of 12 percent this year.


A booming economy will lift China to second place behind the
United States as the world's biggest consumer market by 2015, a
research report from Credit Suisse said last week.
