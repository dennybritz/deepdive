The visiting governor of the US state of Nebraska, Dave Heineman,
was in Havana Monday to sign a deal to expand food exports to the
communist Cuban government.


"It's a good opportunity to expand our relationship. It's a very
good relationship for both, Cuba and our state, and we want to
continue to expand it in the future," said Heineman, who arrived
with 30 US businessmen.


Tuesday, he was to sign a deal with the Cuban state food import
agency Alimport for US beans, corn, wheat, turkey, pork, beef and
soy products. The governor did not immediately put a figure on
the trade deal.


The United States has had a full trade embargo on neighbring
Cuba, the only one- party communist regime in the Americas, since
1962.


But with US businesses elbowing to get in the nearby Cuban
market, a US law passed in 2001, after Cuba was hit hard by
hurricane Michelle, opted to allow Cuba to purchase US food
products as long as they are paid for in cash.


By 2005, the sales rang up an impressive 1.76 billion dollars.
Now, any talk of an embargo by either country rings hollow,
though clearly without sanctions the countries most likely would
trade much more.


"My job is not to engage in international political arena, that's
the domain of the president of the USA and the US Congress,"
added Heineman, whose state rang up contracts worth 60 million
dollars between 2005-2006.
