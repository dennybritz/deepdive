Nationwide turnout in Egypt's referendum on constitutional
amendments on Monday stood between 23 and 27 percent according to
early estimates, Information Minister Anas al-Fiqi said.


"According to the higher electoral commission's estimates, we are
looking at a turnout of between 23 and 27 percent," Fiqi said at
a press conference shortly after polling closed at 7:00 pm (1700
GMT).


Observers and opposition movements however had said earlier that
turnout was unlikely to surpass five percent.


Spearheaded by the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's opposition parties
boycotted the referendum, charging that the amendments are a
major setback for democracy and pluralism.


The independent Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights estimated
the turnout at two to three percent at 2:00 pm (1200 GMT). The
Brotherhood's estimates were similar.


The last referendum to take place in Egypt was in May 2005 when
President Hosni Mubarak proposed a constitutional amendment that
paved the way for the country's first pluralist presidential
election.


Turnout was put officially at 53 percent but experts and
observers said it barely exceeded three percent.
