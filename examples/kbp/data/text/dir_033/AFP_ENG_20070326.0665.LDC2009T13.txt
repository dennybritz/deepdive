Federalists won a close election in French-speaking Quebec
Monday, dashing separatists' hopes of holding a referendum on
breaking away from Canada, said public broadcaster Radio-Canada.


According to projections, the federalist Liberals won 45 seats in
Quebec's 125-seat National Assembly, followed by the greenhorn
conservative Action Democratique du Quebec (ADQ) with 42 seats
and the separatist Parti Quebecois with 38 seats.
