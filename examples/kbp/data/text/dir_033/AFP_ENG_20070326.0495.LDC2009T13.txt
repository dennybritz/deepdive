A bomb rigged to a motorcycle exploded outside a hotel in the
northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar Monday, injuring three
people including a former senator, police said.


The blast, which could be heard throughout the city, broke the
windows of nearby buildings in the central Saddar commercial
area, an AFP reporter at the scene said.


"Three people were injured in the blast," senior police official
Haji Iftikhar told reporters, adding that the motorcycle was
destroyed.


The injured included Aqil Shah, a former senator for the ethnic
Pashtun, secular Awami National Party, who was coming out of the
hotel at the time of blast, he said.


A hotel security guard and a passer-by were also injured and
taken to hospital, he added.


In January a suicide bomber killed 14 people including two top
police officers in Peshawar, which has a history of bomb blasts
blamed on various groups including Islamic extremists.
