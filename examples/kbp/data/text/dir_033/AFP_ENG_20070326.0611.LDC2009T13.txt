A decision on whether or not to bring charges in the so-called
"cash-for- honours" investigation will be made not by the
attorney-general but by Britain's top prosecutor, he said in an
interview published Tuesday.


Speaking to The Times, Sir Ken Macdonald, the director of public
prosecutions, said: "We are going to make the decision."


"If the attorney-general wants to be consulted, of course we will
consult him. But the decision will be made here."


The Attorney-General Lord Peter Goldsmith has said in the past
that he wants to play an "active part" in decisions on whether or
not to bring charges in relation to the cash-for-honours probe.


Goldsmith, a political appointee, has been a controversial figure
in the past, most recently ending a high-profile inquiry late
last year into corruption in deals between defence manufacturer
BAE Systems and Saudi Arabia.


The honours investigation centres on allegations that political
parties, mainly Blair's governing Labour Party, offered seats in
parliament's unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, in
return for financial assistance.


In a year-long probe, so far Scotland Yard has interviewed more
than 100 people and arrested four, including two senior Blair
aides: Lord Michael Levy, Labour's chief fundraiser, and Ruth
Turner, Blair's head of government relations.


Blair himself has been questioned twice as a witness, and his
entire cabinet has also been quizzed.
