Nationwide turnout in Egypt's referendum on constitutional
amendments on Monday stood between 23 and 27 percent according to
early estimates, Information Minister Anas al-Fiqi said.


"According to the higher electoral commission's estimates, we are
looking at a turnout of between 23 and 27 percent," Fiqi said at
a press conference shortly after polling closed at 7:00 pm (1700
GMT).


Observers and opposition movements however had said earlier that
turnout was much lower, with the Egyptian Organisation for Human
Rights putting the figure at five percent of the 35 million
strong electorate.


The Muslim Brothers, who spearheaded an opposition boycott of the
referendum, meanwhile said turnout was five to seven percent in
the cities and 15 percent in the countryside, with a total of
less than nine percent.


Government figures, however, estimated turnouts as high as 60
percent in the remote north Sinai province and over 20 percent in
the main cities of Alexandria and Cairo.


The minister added that low turnouts initially were supplemented
by a surge of voters near the end of the day.


The last referendum to take place in Egypt was in May 2005 when
President Hosni Mubarak proposed a constitutional amendment that
paved the way for the country's first pluralist presidential
election.


Turnout was put officially at 53 percent but experts and
observers said it barely exceeded three percent.
