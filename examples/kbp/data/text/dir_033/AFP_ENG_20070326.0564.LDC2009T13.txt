A 40-year-old British man will on Tuesday become the first person
recognised as having run around the world, according to the
Guinness Book of World Records.


Robert Garside will run into Picadilly Circus in central London,
where he began his first attempt to jog around the world in
December 1996, to be presented with a certificate by authorities
from the publication.


Garside, then a 29-year-old psychology student, failed in that
attempt, and it was only on his fourth try -- beginning at India
Gate in New Delhi the following year -- that he succeeded, ending
up back in the Indian capital in June 2003.


"I am unbelievably happy that an incredibly long project has
finally ended up on a positive note," Garside said.


"I am so happy and relieved and I am so grateful to all those
people all over the world who helped me throughout the years I
was running."


While traversing the world over five years and eight months,
Garside ran across 30 countries on six continents, covering more
than 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometres).


During that time, he slept in the snow in the Himalayas, and at a
monastery in Tibet, and also had to out-run thieves in Mexico and
gunmen in Panama. He even spent five nights in a Chinese jail for
not having the right travel documents.
