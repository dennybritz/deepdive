China's largest trade fair will include an import section for the
first time, state media said Tuesday, in an apparent sop to
mounting concerns about the nation's enormous and growing trade
surplus.


The Canton Fair, scheduled in the south Chinese city of Guangzhou
in April, has been renamed the Chinese Import and Export
Commodities Fair, the China Daily reported.


"The move reflects the Chinese government's intent to promote
imports and achieve a trade balance with other countries," Vice
Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said in the report.


The imports section of the fair will run from April 15 to 20,
whereas the entire event will last 10 days longer. The report
gave no explanation for this.


China is under considerable pressure to do something about its
trade surplus as concerns are multiplying that its booming
exports are wiping out jobs in key trading partners, especially
in European and US manufacturing.


China's trade surplus last year soared 74 percent to hit a record
177.5 billion dollars and has continued to spiral upwards this
year.


China posted a near-record 23.8-billion-dollar trade surplus in
February on a 51.7 percent increase in exports.
