Malaysia, the chair of the 57-nation Organisation of the Islamic
Conference, said Tuesday it would attend an Arab summit which
aims to revive a five-year-old plan for peace with Israel.


The invitation to the summit this week in Riyadh was issued to
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi by Saudi Arabia and the Arab
League, given Malaysia's status as OIC chair, the foreign
ministry said.


"Among the issues that are expected to be raised in the summit
include reviving the Arab peace initiative," the ministry said in
a statement.


"Other issues such as the development in Iraq, the Lebanon issue
and Iran's nuclear programme will also be discussed," it said.


Abdullah is also expected to meet on the sidelines with Middle
Eastern leaders to discuss regional political and security issues
such as the Palestinian- Israeli conflict and the situation in
Iraq, the ministry said.


The 22-member Arab League is due to start its annual summit
Wednesday in Riyadh, with only Libya boycotting the gathering.


Arab foreign ministers meeting before the summit agreed on Monday
to revive the plan for peace with Israel, first adopted in Beirut
in 2002.


The Saudi-inspired Arab plan proposes full normalisation of
relations with Israel if it fully withdraws from all land it
occupied in 1967, permits the creation of an independent
Palestinian state and allows the return of Palestinian refugees.
