A terror suspect in the 2002 bombing of a hotel in Kenya and an
attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner has been captured in
East Africa and transferred to Guantanamo Bay, a Pentagon
spokesman said Monday.


Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman identified the man as Abdul
Malik, who he said has admitted to taking part in the attack on
the Paradise Hotel in Mombassa that killed 13, as well as an
attempt to bring down an Israeli airliner in the city.


"He was captured as a result of our ongoing armed conflict
against Al-Qaeda and was involved in terrorist attacks in East
Africa," Whitman said.


"Due to the significant threat that this terror suspects
represents he has been transferred to Guantanamo," he said.


The International Committee of the Red Cross has been notified of
the captured and will be granted access to him, he said.


Whitman would say only that Malik was picked up in East Africa
and came into US custody this year. He was held for a short while
in US custody before being transferred to the US military base in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.


Whitman would provide no other details on Malik's capture or how
he came into US custody.


"Success in the global war on terror requires us to work closely
as well as quietly with many of our allies in the region," he
said.


Malik joins 14 top terror suspects who were transferred to
Guantanamo in September from secret CIA detention facilities
overseas.


Before that the last time a detainee was transferred to
Guantanamo was in September 2004.
