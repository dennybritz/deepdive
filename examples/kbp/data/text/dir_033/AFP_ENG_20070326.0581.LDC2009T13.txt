Rebels in Ivory Coast said on Monday that their leader, Guillaume
Soro, has been appointed prime minister following a peace accord
signed earlier this month.


The news was confirmed by an official in neighbouring Burkina
Faso, where representatives of the Ivorian President Laurent
Gbagbo met for talks with the rebels last week.


"Soro has been appointed prime minister," said the official who
asked not to be named.


Soro led an abortive coup against Gbagbo in 2002, triggering a
brief civil war that has left the west African country divided
ever since.
