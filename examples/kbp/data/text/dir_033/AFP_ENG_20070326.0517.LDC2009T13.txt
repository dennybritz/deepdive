British Airways and Iberia of Spain are among 15 European
airlines that could be barred from Russian airspace if they
continue to breach safety regulations, the Kommersant newspaper
reported Monday.


The newspaper's website cited a letter sent earlier this month by
the head of Russia's federal air navigation agency, Alexander
Neradko, to the president of the European civil aviation
conference, Michael Wachenheim.


The letter urged "the speedy adoption of special measures" to end
the violations, saying that otherwise 15 European Union airlines
could face a ban from Russia.


The Kommersant report cited two incidents mentioned in the
letter.


A BA plane had entered a forbidden section of Russian airspace in
order to avoid a storm and an Iberia jet came too close to
another plane because it was flying at the wrong altitude, the
letter was quoted as saying.


Russian air navigation officials and airline company executives
in Moscow could not immediately be contacted. Russian news
agencies reported on March 16 that a letter had been sent but did
not name the airlines concerned.


European Commission transport spokesman Michele Cercone said at
the time that the EU's executive arm had received no official
report or letter on the matter from the Russian side and so could
not comment.
