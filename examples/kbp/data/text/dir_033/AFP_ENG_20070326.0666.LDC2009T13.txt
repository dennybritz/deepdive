The US Treasury's pointman on financial crime met with North
Korean officials here in a bid to end a sanctions dispute that
has held up nuclear disarmament talks, his spokeswoman said
Tuesday.


Daniel Glaser, the deputy assistant secretary for terrorist
financing and financial crimes, led a US Treasury delegation in
the talks on Monday night at the North Korean embassy,
spokeswoman Molly Millerwise said.


She said the two sides discussed how to implement a deal
announced last week that would see 25 million dollars frozen in a
Macau bank due to accusations of money laundering and
counterfeiting returned to North Korea.


"The discussion focused on implementing the agreement announced
last week. We are committed to working through this issue as
quickly as possible," Millerwise said.


Millerwise did not give further details of the discussions or say
when a resolution was likely.


However the chief US envoy to six-nation talks aimed at ending
North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, Christopher Hill, said
overnight in Washington that he expected the issue to be resolved
in a couple of days.


The six-nation talks broke down last week after North Korea
refused to enter negotiations until the 25 million dollars was
safely returned.


The money was supposed to be transferred quickly to a North
Korean account with the Bank of China.


However the state-owned lender has reportedly refused to accept
the money for fear the transaction may hurt its credit rating.
