Athletic's world governing body IAAF recommended at a meeting
here on Monday a four-year doping suspension for a first offence
in certain cases.


The IAAF, whose congress will discuss this proposal in Osaka,
Japan, at the end of August, is hoping to urge the World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA) to adopt their recommendations when the
World Anti-Doping Code is revised in Madrid in November.


Currently, two years is applied for a first offence.


The IAAF said the four cases for a four-year ban would be the
presence/use/possession of anabolic steroids, hormones (including
EPO) and amphetamine; the presence/use/possession of all
prohibited methods; the refusal or failure to submit to a doping
control or otherwise evading the doping control; tampering, or
attempting to tamper, with the doping control process.
