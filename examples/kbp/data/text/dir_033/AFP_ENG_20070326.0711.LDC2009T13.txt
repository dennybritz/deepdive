Already a world power in diving, table tennis and gymnastics,
China now has the potential to dominate cue sports, teen snooker
ace Ding Junhui said in comments quoted by state media on
Tuesday.


"For sure, China has shown great momentum to become a leading cue
sports country," Ding told the China Daily newspaper.


"We have a lot of players displaying good skills and mentality on
the tour and I think it's just a matter of time before we see
more elite Chinese cue players."


The 19-year-old spoke after vanquishing Northern Ireland's Adrian
Gunnell in a qualifier for the China Open in Beijing on Monday.


Chinese players dominated on Monday, with six out of nine earning
berths in the first round.


The paper credited Ding with sparking national interest in cue
sports, once considered a disreputable pastime in China.


Teenager Ding was dubbed a potential world beater after his run
to the final of the British Masters at Wembley in January. Former
world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan who beat Ding in the final
described him as one of the rarest talents he had ever seen.
