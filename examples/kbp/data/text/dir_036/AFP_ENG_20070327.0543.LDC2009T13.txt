A suicide truck bomb and a separate car bombing killed 55 people
and wounded at least 120 in the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar
on Tuesday, security sources and a doctor said.


The bombers struck just three days after a marketplace suicide
attack killed 10 people in the same town.


Soldiers waved the suicide bomber through into Tal Afar when they
saw it was laden with food supplies following a one-week
shortage. The bomber then blew up the vehicle, said Doctor Ali
Abboud.


No details were immediately available on the car bombing.


US President George W. Bush last year held up Tal Afar as a model
for coalition efforts to create a stable Iraq.


The US military in Baghdad said coalition helicopters had been
mobilised to evacuate the wounded to US medical facilities.


It said the explosion left a 15 metre (50 foot) wide crater and
caused several buildings to collapse.
