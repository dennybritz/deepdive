Two men armed with grenades and handguns commandeered a bus and
took 32 children and two teachers hostage in the Philippine
capital Wednesday, police said.


A crack police team surrounded the bus which was stopped outside
Manila city hall. The children were apparently on a field trip.


"The initial report that we have is that 32 students and two
teachers are inside the bus and being held hostage by two men
armed with grenades and firearms," a Manila police officer told
DZBB radio.


The armed men were communicating with the police by way of
messages written on cardboard. Terrified children were seen
peeking out of the window curtains.
