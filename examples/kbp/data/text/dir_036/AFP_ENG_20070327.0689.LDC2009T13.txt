Hewlett-Packard sued Acer in a US court on Tuesday alleging the
Taiwan-based computer maker with unauthorized use of its patented
technology.


HP asked a federal judge to bar Acer from selling computers with
the disputed technology in the United States and demanded triple
cash damages because of "Acer's willful infringement" on five
patents.


"This action was necessary because HP believes Acer has been
selling computer products that use HP's patented technologies
without permission," the Palo Alto, California, computer giant
said in a written release.


"HP today is taking necessary action to protect its intellectual
property against unauthorized use. HP respects the intellectual
property rights of others and expects the same treatment in
return."


The technology at issue was used in Acer personal computers,
including desktops, laptops, and media centers for homes or
businesses, according to the suit filed by HP in US District
Court in Eastern Texas.
