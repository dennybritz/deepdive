A suicide truck bomb and a separate car bombing killed 50 people
and wounded more than 100 on Tuesday in Iraq's northern town of
Tal Afar, security sources and a doctor said.


Bodies and wounded civilians were brought to hospital following
the two blasts, which comes just three days after a marketplace
suicide attack killed 10 people in the same town.


Soldiers waved the suicide bomber through into Tal Afar when they
saw it was laden with food supplies following a one-week
shortage. The bomber then blew up the vehicle, said Doctor Ali
Abboud.


No details were immediately available on the car bombing.


US President George W. Bush last year held up Tal Afar as a model
for coalition efforts to create a stable Iraq.


The US military in Baghdad said coalition force helicopters have
been mobilised to evacuate the wounded and transport them to US
medical facilities.


It said the explosion left a 50 foot (15 meter) wide crater and
caused several buildings to collapse.
