The German foreign ministry said on Tuesday it had called in the
Iranian ambassador to Berlin and reiterated a demand for the
immediate release of 15 detained British naval personnel.


A ministry spokeswoman said ambassador Mohammad Akhondzadeh was
told that Iran was obliged to give Britain consular access to the
sailors.


He was also told that the Islamic republic will be held
responsible for their safety, she said.


Germany holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.


The bloc has vowed to do everything possible to secure the
release of the 14 British men and one woman who were seized by
its forces in the Gulf last Friday.


Iran claims they had entered its waters illegally and has defied
mounting pressure to free the group, saying Monday that they were
being interrogated.


British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said Tuesday it
appeared that diplomatic efforts to secure their release have
yielded no progress.
