The Los Angeles Kings signed defenceman Jack Johnson, the third
overall pick in the 2005 draft, to a multi-year contract.


Originally selected by Carolina, Johnson was acquired by the
Kings along with defenceman Oleg Tverdovsky on September 29,
2006.


The 20-year-old American was drafted behind Pittsburgh Penguins
superstar Sidney Crosby and Bobby Ryan.


The Kings signed Johnson Tuesday and he will practice with the
team Wednesday. He could make his NHL debut Thursday against
Vancouver.


Johnson, who played this season for the University of Michigan,
has competed in the past two World Junior Championships for the
United States.


In the 2005 World Juniors he was given a game misconduct for a
unprovoked attack on Canada's Steve Downie after Downie's
teammate Kyle Chipchura had scored the winning goal in the final
seconds of a 3-2 Canadian victory.
