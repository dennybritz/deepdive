The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Christopher Cox, urged US lawmakers to support a budget hike for
the market watchdog Tuesday, saying it would help the fight
against white-collar crime.


Cox said the SEC could ratchet up its policing of corporate
America if Congress backs a White House request to boost its
fiscal year 2008 budget by 23 million dollars to 905.3 million
dollars from 2007.


"I fully support this request for increased funding," Cox, a
former lawmaker, said.


He said the extra cash would enable the SEC to modernize its
online filing system, known as EDGAR, through which US companies
submit their financial results to the watchdog and investors for
review.


The regulator is also vying to develop a new information system
dubbed Phoenix which is designed to improve the tracking and
distribution of funds to wronged investors.


The agency is also gearing up to oversee credit rating agencies
this year including Standard and Poor's and Moody's following
congressional concern about conflicts of interest in the sector.


The SEC's budget has been bolstered, since the collapse of the
Internet bubble and big firms such as Enron and WorldCom, in
recent years and it has also moved into a new purprose built
headquarters.


Its 3,600 staffers keep watch on over 10,000 publicly traded
companies, thousands of broker-dealers, and investment advisers
who manage over 32 trillion dollars in assets.
