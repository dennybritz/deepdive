A German court was asked to decide on Tuesday in the case of a
family divided over whether a dead man's ashes should be
transformed into a diamond.


The court heard that the man's daughter wants to send the ashes
to Switzerland to be turned into a "memorial" diamond, a
technique which originated in the United States but is becoming
popular in Europe.


The woman claims that her father told her before his death from
cancer last year that he wanted to be immortalized as a diamond.


But the man's wife disputes her daughter's claim, saying he had
wanted the urn of his ashes to be buried in a cemetery.


The court in the southwestern city of Wiesbaden is expected to
give its ruling next Tuesday.


In the process, the ashes are subjected to intense heat to
produce graphite which is then pressed to produce a raw crystal
that is then polished and cut into a synthetic diamond.
