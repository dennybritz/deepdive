Australia made 322-6 off their 50 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against the West Indies here on Tuesday.


Opener Matthew Hayden, who set a World Cup record for the fastest
century against South Africa on Saturday, hit a second successive
ton and made 158 before he was out in the 48th over.


It was Hayden's ninth ODI century and the highest score ever made
by an Australian in a World Cup match.


He was eventually out, caught in the deep by Marlon Samuels off
Dwayne Bravo having hit 14 fours and four sixes in his 143-ball
innings.


Shane Watson was not out 33 while Brad Hogg was on 5.


Adam Gilchrist had been dismissed when he was caught by
wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin off Daren Powell for seven in the
fifth over.


Captain Ricky Ponting then made a quickfire 35 off 36 balls
before he was run out by a brilliant throw from Ramnaresh Sarwan
in the covers in the 15th over.


Michael Clarke and Hayden then put on 98 for the third wicket
before Clarke went lbw for 41 to Dwayne Bravo with the total on
174.


Andrew Symonds became the fourth man to fall when he was caught
behind off Samuels with the score on 208. The all-rounder had
made 13.


Michael Hussey made just nine.


Australia had struggled in the early conditions making just 10
off the first four overs with Hayden having to wait until his
18th ball for his first run.


West Indies skipper Brian Lara won the toss and elected to field
in the first international match to be played at the new Sir
Vivian Richards Stadium. dj07
