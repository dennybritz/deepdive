The United Nations and African Union envoys to Sudan underlined
Tuesday the urgency of a settlement in the western region of
Darfur, where a four-year conflict has spread to neighbouring
countries.


"Time is not on our side," UN envoy Jan Eliasson told a news
conference during his second trip to Sudan with AU envoy Salim
Ahmed Salim since joining efforts to seek a solution.


"The conflict is dangerous for Darfur, Sudan and the region," he
said.


Ethnic violence which has plagued Sudan for years has spilled
over into Chad and the Central African Republic, the two
countries bordering Darfur.


Khartoum took part in peace talks with the Darfur rebels in
Nigeria in 2006 but in the end only one faction signed the
resulting agreement and the rest intensified their uprising.


The two envoys both called for resumed talks between the
government and those rebel groups which did not sign the Abuja
accord.


They acknowledged that deadly clashes in the Sudanese capital
this week between police and former rebels of the faction which
signed the deal were unlikely to encourage other groups to join
the peace process.


But they called for an investigation to be opened into the cause
of the clashes.


According to the United Nations, at least 200,000 people have
been killed and two million displaced since the rebels first rose
up in early 2003. Some sources say the death toll is much higher.
