Britain's ruling Labour Party slashed the opinion poll lead of
the main opposition Conservatives after finance minister Gordon
Brown's budget last week, according to a poll Tuesday.


The CommunicateResearch poll for The Independent newspaper showed
that 31 percent of voters supported Labour, up two percentage
points from a similar survey a month ago, while backing for the
Tories had dropped five points to 35 percent.


The Liberal Democrats, Britain's third-biggest political party,
rose three points to 20 percent.


It comes as welcome news for a Labour Party that had been
languishing in the polls, frequently trailing the Tories by
double-digits, and for Brown, seen as the likely successor to
Prime Minister Tony Blair when he steps down later this year.


The survey, set to be published in Wednesday's Independent,
showed that much of Labour's recovery was due to the return of
middle-income earners to its voting ranks, many of whom
benefitted from a tax cut in Brown's March 21 budget.


CommunicateResearch questioned 1,002 people between March 23 and
25.
