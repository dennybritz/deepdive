French construction and services group Vinci said on Tuesday that
it would propose a share buyback programme, amid rumours that it
might have become a takeover target.


Vinci said it will propose to shareholders at its annual meeting
on May 10 a share buyback of up to 3.5 billion euros (4.7 billion
dollars), or 10 percent of the company's capital.


Share buyback programmes are often intended to keep owners of a
company's stock onboard, in particular when speculation of a
takeover bid arises.


Vinci has become the target of such rumours, and its second
largest shareholder, the Artemis holding group of Francois
Pinault, is believed to have raised its stake recently to 8.1
percent.


Vinci added that it will also seek shareholders' approval to
divide the nominal share price by two, doubling the number of
outstanding shares, "to increase the shares' liquidity and
encourage individual shareholders."


Stock in the French group has gained about 19 percent in value
since the beginning of the year, and its shares closed on Tuesday
at 115.10 euros.


Finally, the company reiterated its intention to propose a
dividend of 2.65 euros per share, a 33 percent increase on the
previous year.
