A Tottenham fan who ran onto the pitch after their FA Cup
quarter-final defeat by Chelsea at White Hart Lane and tried to
punch Frank Lampard was banned from football matches for three
years Tuesday.


Timothy John Lawrence Smith was arrested after running onto the
pitch at the end of the game on March 19 and throwing a punch at
Lampard, although he failed to make contact with the England
midfielder.


The 18-year-old junior architect pleaded guilty to encroaching
onto the pitch and was fined 300 pounds (590 dollars) and ordered
to pay 50 pounds (98 dollars) in costs.


The order means he cannot attend any regulated matches in England
or Wales and will have to report to a police station to surrender
his passport before overseas matches.


Smith has already been banned for life from White Hart Lane by
the club.


A second man, Simon Barritt, 28, received an identical ban and
300 pounds fine for running onto the pitch.
