Greenpeace activists on Tuesday scaled a nuclear cooling tower in
central France in a spectacular stunt to draw attention to its
campaign against nuclear power.


Activists from eight different countries targeted a plant in
Belleville sur Loire, climbing the tower's outer ladder and
absailing half-way back down to spray-paint the words "EPR =
Danger".


Construction of France's first so-called "third-generation"
European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR), located in Flamanville
near the English Channel, is due to begin by the end of the year.


But the project is opposed by anti-nuclear activists, who drew
tens of thousands of people into the streets in protest earlier
this month.


"We want to denounce the dangers of nuclear power in general and
the EPR in particular," said a Greenpeace spokeswoman Adelaide
Colin.


France derives more than three-quarters of its electricity from
nuclear power, the highest ratio of any country in the world, and
many of its 58 reactors are nearing the end of their usefulness.


Designed to generate power for 60 years, the EPR will gradually
take over as the reactors currently in service are start to be
decommissioned from 2015.


Around 60 police officers, backed by elite commando squads and
four helicopters, were mobilised during the operation, although
the power provider Electricite de France said the demonstrators
had not come close to any dangerous installations.
