The head of Armenia's Apostolic Church has declined an invitation
from Turkey to attend the opening of a restored Armenian church,
his office announced Tuesday.


Catholicos Karekin II would not be attending because the restored
church was being converted into a museum and the ceremony would
be a non-religious one, the church said in a statement.


The Church of the Holy Cross was built on Akhtamar Island in Lake
Van, eastern Turkey, in the 10th century but abandoned after the
World War I killings of Armenians under Ottoman rule.


Restored by the Turkish authorities, it is due to be opened on
Thursday.


Relations between Turkey and Armenia are still strained over the
Ottoman-era killings, which took place between 1915 and 1917.


Yerevan describes the killings as genocide, a label that Turkey,
the Ottoman Empire's successor, categorically rejects.


The murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, who
supported the genocide position, has further strained relations.
He was shot dead in Istanbul on January 19.


Earlier this month, lawyers for his family filed a motion for a
judicial probe into officials they accused of being implicated in
the murder.
