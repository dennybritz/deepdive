Despite the fact that they have left Jamaica, the Pakistan team
has not been cleared in the inquiry into the murder of cricket
coach Bob Woolmer, the detective heading the probe told the BBC
on Tuesday.


Presented with comments from Pakistan team media spokesman Pervez
Mir that the team had been cleared, Deputy Police Commissioner
Mark Shields told the broadcaster: "That's a pretty inaccurate
statement, because nobody at this stage can be ruled out of the
inquiry."


Shields added that a theory that "keeps coming to light" about
the circumstances surrounding Woolmer's death is one involving
match-fixing.


"One of those that keeps coming to light, it looks like, is
around match-fixing and bookies, so therefore that's the clear
line of inquiry, but its not the only line."


Woolmer was last week declared to have been strangled in "evil
and extraordinary" circumstances in the aftermath of Pakistan's
shock defeat and World Cup exit at the hands of minnows Ireland.


The murder has triggered frenzied conspiracy theories about
illegal match-fixing in cricket, with several former players
speculating Woolmer had been killed to prevent him from speaking
out.


However close friends and family say they have found nothing to
suggest there is any truth to the claim that the respected former
England international was set to blow the whistle on cricket
corruption.
