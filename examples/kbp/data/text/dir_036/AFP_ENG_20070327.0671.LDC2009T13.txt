An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.8 hit Japan's central
peninsula of Noto Wednesday morning, one of the strongest
aftershocks following Sunday's initial 6.9-magnitude quake,
officials said.


The latest jolt occurred at 8:08 am (2308 GMT) with its epicentre
located at a depth of 10 kilometres (six miles) below the Wajima
area on the west coast of the main island of Honshu.


There was no danger of a tsunami following the tremor, the
meteorological agency said, warning that strong aftershocks were
forecast to continue to strike the region over the next few days.


The region has been hit by more than 260 aftershocks since
Sunday's quake which killed one person and injured 218.


More than 1,000 residents spent their third night in emergency
shelters after the quake destroyed wooden houses, triggered
landslides and paralysed traffic, with water supplies still cut
in a large part of the city.


More than 880 buildings were damaged, 59 of them completely
destroyed, the disaster agency said, warning that the damaged
buildings -- many of them older wooden homes with heavy roof
tiles -- may collapse due to aftershocks.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes. A
7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe in January
1995 killed more than 6,400 people.
