A suicide truck bomb and a separate car bombing killed 50 people
and wounded more than 100 on Tuesday in Iraq's northern town of
Tal Afar, security sources said.


The US military in Baghdad said coalition force helicopters have
been mobilised to evacuate the wounded and transport them to US
medical facilities.


It said the explosion left a 50 foot (15 meter) wide crater and
caused several buildings to collapse.
