The battle for the devotion of people who use the Internet on the
go intensified on Tuesday as Google unveiled a new mobile
Internet search engine.


Google made its new mobile search engine available to the public
on the same day that Sunnyvale, California-based rival Yahoo
enticed website publishers to enhance the "oneSearch" mobile
search engine Yahoo released early this year.


"We're making our new mobile search openly available, so everyone
can take it for a spin," Google product manager Yael Shacham
wrote in posting on the Mountain View, California-company's
website.


"The next time you visit Google.com on your phone, you'll see a
link that will take you to a mobile search experience that's more
tailored to your needs."


Yahoo said that the Mobile Publisher Services suite of services
it launched Tuesday was "designed to enable publishers to
increase the discovery, distribution and monetization of their
content on mobile phones."
