Australian Open champion Serena Williams demolished top seed
Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 in a rematch of their Melbourne final at
the 6.9 million-dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series tournament here
Tuesday.


Williams, who also rolled to a lopsided victory Down Under in
January, will face Czech Nicole Vaidisova for a berth in the
semi-finals after dispatching last year's Miami runner-up.


Sharapova had eliminated Williams' sister Venus 2-6, 6-2, 7-5 on
Sunday.


Another rematch will be staged later as world number one Roger
Federer will face Guillermo Canas of Argentina, who ended the
Swiss star's 41-match win streak in a second-round match earlier
this month at Indian Wells, California.


Britain's Andy Murray rallied to reach the quarter-finals on the
men's side. The 19-year-old Scotsman, ranked 12th in the world,
eliminated Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu 2-6, 7-5, 6-3.


Murray needed two hours and seven minutes to defeat his 61st-
rated foe and reach a quarter-final date against the winner of a
later match between Spain's David Ferrer and US third seed Andy
Roddick.


China's Li Na fell to Russia's Anna Chakvetadze 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 in
a women's quarter-final.


Chakvetadze booked a semi-final date against the winner of a
later match between world number one Justine Henin, the second
seed from Belgium, and Russian sixth seed Nadia Petrova.
