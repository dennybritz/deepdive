President Amadou Toumani Toure of Mali is to stand for election
in next month's presidential elections, one of his advisers told
AFP on Tuesday.


Eight other candidates have already declared themselves,
including the speaker of Mali's national assembly, former prime
minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.


The first round of the election is scheduled for April 29, with a
May 13 second- round run-off between the top two contenders if no
candidate wins an overall majority.


Toure, a former army general, is credited with saving Mali from
the military dictatorship of Moussa Toure and returning it to
democracy. He directed a transitional process in 2001 before
winning the 2002 presidential elections.
