US comedian Eddie Griffin crashed a borrowed 1.5 million-dollar
Ferrari while warming up for a celebrity charity race, according
to local media Tuesday.


Griffin, 38, was not injured when he lost control of the red
racer on Monday and hit a wall during a practice lap at Irwindale
Speedway, west of Los Angeles, local news station KCBS said.


Film director Daniel Sedek had lent the car to the star of
"Norbit" and "Undercover Brother" so he could run in the
fundraiser Tuesday.


"The brother's good at karate and all the rest of that, but the
brother can't drive," Griffin told reporters.


Sedek said his Enzo, one of only 400 built by the Italian
company, was a total write-off.


New Orleans Saints football player Reggie Bush and martial arts
star Jackie Chan also participated in the benefit "Race for a
Cause."


The event also promoted the film "Redline," a comedy about sports
cars, in which Griffin acted and Sedek produced. There was no
word on whether Sedak will dock Griffin's pay.
