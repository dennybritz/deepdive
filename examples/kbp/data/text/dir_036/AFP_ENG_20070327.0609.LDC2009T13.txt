The UN Security Council will endorse the appointment of rebel
leader Guillaume Soro as Ivory Coast's new prime minister, South
African Ambassador Dumasani Kumalo said Tuesday.


Kumalo, who chairs the 15-member body this month, told reporters
that Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaore had officially
notified the council of Soro's appointment under a peace deal
reached with Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo.


"The Security Council will endorse that decision tomorrow" in a
statement, he added.


Soro is to replace Charles Konan Banny, who was appointed prime
minister by the international community in 2005 and given wider
powers under a Security Council resolution last year to pursue
the peace process and move toward new elections.


The Ivorian peace accord, signed March 4 in the Burkina Faso
capital of Ouagadougou, envisages a government of 33 cabinet
ministers, of which 18 portfolios will go to the rebel New Forces
group.


Soro, a 34-year-old former student leader, led an attempted coup
against Gbagbo in 2002 sparking a civil war that left the West
African country effectively divided in two.


Gbagbo said Tuesday that the new government would be in place
"this week or next week at the latest."
