The Democratic Repubic of Congo's ex-vice president Jean-Pierre
Bemba, who has taken refuge in South Africa's embassy in
Kinshasa, can remain there for as long as he wants, the Pretoria
government said Tuesday.


Deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad said Bemba, who sought refuge
last week when the government of his rival President Joseph
Kabila was about to issue him with a warrant for treason, had yet
to reveal his long-term plans.


"Bemba is still taking refuge in South African property," Pahad
told reporters at a government briefing. "He has not really
indicated what his thinking is.


"He will remain until he ses it fit for him to leave ... South
Africa is bound by international conventions to give him
protection."


Government troops fought fighters loyal to Bemba in the Gombe
district of Kinshasa late last week in clashes that the European
Union says may have claimed as many as 500 lives.


The forces unleashed their offensive after Bemba, runner-up to
Kabila in last year's presidential elections, refused to
integrate his militia into the army.


In an interview with the French daily Le Monde after he took
refuge, Bemba accused Kabila of wanting to "get rid" of him.


The DRC was the centre of a brutal five-year-long war from 1998.
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed and at its height,
the conflict in the former Zaire drew in seven foreign armies.


South Africa has been a key player in the peace process and
currently has about 2,000 troops serving in a UN peacekeeping
mission in the DRC.
