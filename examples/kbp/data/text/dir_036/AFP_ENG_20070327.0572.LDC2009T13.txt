Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz, widely criticised for the
failings of last summer's Lebanon war, offered Tuesday to switch
to the finance ministry in the event he retains his party
leadership.


"If I am elected party leader on May 28, the same evening I will
notify the prime minister that I am ready to review our coalition
agreement and take the finance ministry instead," Peretz told
activists of his centre-left Labour party.


Peretz faces a tough battle for re-election in the vote among the
party membership.


One recent opinion poll put him in fouth place on just 13
percent. Former prime minister Ehud Barak placed first with 31
percent support, followed by MPs Ami Ayalon and Ophir Pines on 27
percent and 19 percent respectively.


Another poll put the Moroccan-born Peretz in third place on 19
percent, behind Ayalon and Barak who were credited with 28
percent and 26 percent support respectively.


Labour is the senior coalition partner of the centrist Kadima
party of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
