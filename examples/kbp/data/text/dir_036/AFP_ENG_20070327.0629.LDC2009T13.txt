A town in northern Kosovo was rocked Tuesday by a hand-grenade
attack during a period of heightened tensions following a UN plan
to grant the Serbian province independence.


Two cars were damaged and several nearby windows smashed when a
hand-grenade was thrown by unknown attackers on a passing vehicle
in Kosovka Mitrovica, police said. No one was injured in the
blast.


It was the second violent incident in the same area of the Serb-
majority town known as Bosnjacka Mahala, which is mostly
populated by ethnic Albanians.


Police sealed off the area, where the Serbian government offices
for Kosovo are also situated, and were investigating the
incident.


The blast came the day after United Nations envoy Martti
Ahtisaari presented his plan for Kosovo's future status,
proposing internationally-supervised independence for the
province.


Kosovo has been administered by the UN since mid-1999, when a
NATO bombing campaign helped to halt a brutal crackdown by Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians.


After 13 months of negotiations led by Ahtisaari, both Belgrade
and Kosovo Serbs earlier this month rejected independence for the
province, calling instead for more negotiations.


But Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population of two million, have accepted the Ahtisaari plan and
reject any links with Belgrade.


The UN Security Council is expected to debate the Ahtisaari plan
next month.
