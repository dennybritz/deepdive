The anti-terrorism court in Rabat has charged and jailed 24
suspects for involvement in a suicide bombing in Casablanca that
killed one person and injured four others, a judicial source said
on Tuesday.


The bomber, Abdelfettah Raydi, died in the March 11 attack on the
cybercafe. His suspected accomplice, Youssef Khoudri, who was
injured in the blast, was among those charged, the source said.


The suspects were all charged with belonging to a group with the
intention of committing terrorist acts, attacks on the state and
illegal fundraising.


Last week, the interior minister said the suspects were targeting
economic hubs, including the port of Casablanca, as well as
tourist spots such as Tangiers, Essouiara and Marrakech.
