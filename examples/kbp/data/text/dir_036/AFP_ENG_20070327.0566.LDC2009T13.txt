Britain's Andy Murray rallied to reach the quarter-finals of the
6.9 million- dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt
tournament here Tuesday while China's Li Na was ousted by a
rival's comeback.


Scottish teen Murray, ranked 12th in the world, eliminated
Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu 2-6, 7-5, 6-3 in a fourth-round
encounter while Li fell to Russia's Anna Chakvetadze 4-6, 7-5,
6-2 in a women's quarter-final.


Murray, 19, needed two hours and seven minutes to defeat his
61st-rated foe and reach a quarter-final date against the winner
of a later match between Spain's David Ferrer and US third seed
Andy Roddick.


Chakvetadze booked a semi-final date against the winner of a
later match between world number one Justine Henin, the second
seed from Belgium, and Russian sixth seed Nadia Petrova.


Rematches highlighted Tuesday's later match schedule.


World number one Roger Federer will face Guillermo Canas of
Argentina, who ended the Swiss star's 41-match win streak in a
second-round match earlier this month at Indian Wells,
California.


Australian Open champion Serena Williams will meet Russian top
seed Maria Sharapova in a rematch of the Grand Slam final from
January in Melbourne.
