Islamic Jihad rejected in advance Tuesday any decisions that
might be adopted at the imminent Arab League summit in Riyadh
that could lead to the recognition of Israel.


"Any decisions or initiatives accepting the existence of the
Zionist entity are an affront to our people, and we consider them
illegal," the radical Islamist group said in a statement obtained
by AFP in Gaza.


Elsewhere in the text the group reiterated its position that it
"would never" recognise Israel and vowed to continue its struggle
against the Jewish state.


Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for all recent suicide
bombings inside Israel, including the last such attack on January
29, when a bomber from the Gaza Strip killed three people in a
bakery in the Red Sea resort of Eilat.


Arab leaders gathered in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for a summit
which will formally relaunch a long-dormant Arab plan for Middle
East peace and actively seek negotiations with Israel.


The annual meeting of heads of state, which starts on Wednesday,
comes after US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appealed to
Arab governments to "begin reaching out to Israel" by building on
the peace blueprint first adopted at a summit in Beirut in 2002.
