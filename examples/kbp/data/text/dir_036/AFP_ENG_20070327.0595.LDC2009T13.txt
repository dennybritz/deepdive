Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo is in doubt for Wednesday's
Euro 2008 qualifier against Serbia in Belgrade after suffering a
sprain in training Tuesday.


A Portuguese Football Federation spokesman said the Manchester
United striker picked up the injury in the final minutes of
training at the Red Star Belgrade stadium.


Ronaldo scored twice to help Portugal to a 4-0 win in Saturday's
European qualifier against Belgium in Lisbon.


Portugal are third in Group A three points behind leaders Poland
with the top two teams qualifying for the Euro 2008 finals.
