An independent public inquiry got underway Tuesday into the
deaths of 1,757 haemophilia patients who were supplied with
contaminated blood provided by Britain's state health service.


Lord Peter Archer, a former solicitor-general, who is leading the
inquiry, said it would investigate the circumstances surrounding
the supply, plus the consequences for haemophiliacs and others
afflicted.


It would also recommend further steps to address the problems and
needs of sufferers.


The patients who died were exposed to HIV and/or hepatitis C by
contaminated blood and blood products between the early 1970s and
the mid-1980s. Many more are said to be terminally ill.


"The purpose of the inquiry is to unravel the facts, so far as we
are able, and to point to the lessons that may be learnt," Archer
said.


"As in the case of any public inquiry, the consequences of its
report cannot be foreseen.


"Its impact will, however, depend crucially on the public
perception of its value and we shall endeavour to make it a
report worthy of high regard.


"Hopefully our findings may help to restore public confidence in
the future treatment of patients.


"We trust it will also help those afflicted and bereaved to come
to terms with the tragedy -- knowing much more of how it came
about."


Archer will call on patients, bereaved dependents, former British
health ministers and "other eminent witnesses".


The inquiry will begin hearing oral evidence on April 18.


Haemophilia describes various hereditary genetic illnesses that
limit the body's ability to control bleeding.
