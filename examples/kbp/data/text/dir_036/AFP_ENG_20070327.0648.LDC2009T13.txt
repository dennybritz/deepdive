Canada's minority Conservative government passed its 2007-2008
budget Tuesday, with the support of only the separatist Bloc
Quebecois to avert an early election.


Lawmakers voted 176 votes to 119 in support of the spending plan.


Government revenues are expected to climb to 236.7 billion
dollars (200.9 billion US) while spending would increase to 233.4
billion dollars (198.2 billion US), with the bulk of new spending
going to the provinces as lump sums.


Canada's national debt, meanwhile, would be reduced by 9.2
billion dollars (7.8 billion US) in 2006-2007, and a further 3.0
billion dollars (2.5 billion US) in the following fiscal year.


More than one billion dollars (850 million US) in personal and
corporate tax cuts per year meanwhile are expected from debt-
interest savings.


Canada is the only Group of Seven (G7) industrialized country to
post a budget surplus in the past decade, according to the
Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development.


But the cornerstone of the spending plan is billions of dollars
in transfers from federal coffers to the provinces to solve a so-
called "fiscal imbalance" that has seen Ottawa awash in tax
revenues while Canada's provinces struggle to pay for social
services.


The discrepancy has in part spurred a Quebec independence
movement.
