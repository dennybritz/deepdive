Argentina on Tuesday scrapped a deal with Britain to share oil
found off the Falkland Islands, which both countries claim,
Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana said.


Taiana said Argentina made the move to end the cooperation
arrangement because Britain unilaterally opted to put out for
public bid oil deals in the area in the South Atlantic.


"Argentina does not oppose cooperating with the United Kingdom,
so long as this contributes to reopening talks about the islands'
sovereignty," the top Argentine diplomat said.


The two countries went to war 25 years ago on April 2, 1982, over
control of the Falkland Islands, which Argentina calls the
Malvinas.


Taiana spoke to reporters after a meeting with President Nestor
Kirchner in the presidential palace on the matter.


"Argentina has asked the United Kingdom for open dialogue," he
said.


"Unfortunately, the persistent intransigence of the United
Kingdom has not allowed for frank discussion."
