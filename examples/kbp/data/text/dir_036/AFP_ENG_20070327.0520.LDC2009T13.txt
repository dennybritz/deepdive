Emergency services set up oil slick booms on the Daugava River
near the Latvian city of Daugavpils Tuesday as a huge oil slick
flowed in from Belarus.


Belarus first raised the alert on Saturday as diesel fuel spilled
into the Belarussian part of the river -- the Western Dvina --
from an oil pipeline owned by Russian company Zapad
Transnefteprodukt.


Latvia said however that Belarus had under-reported the extent of
the pollution.


"The oil is still flowing and we can't predict when it will stop.
It's an unpleasant situation," the head of Latvia's State
Environment Service, Vilis Avotins, told AFP.


Belarussian authorities had originally said the slick stretched
around eight kilometers (five miles) along the river, and was
under control, but on Tuesday, Avotins said 100 kilometers (60
miles) of river in Latvia had been affected.


River conditions were hampering efforts to contain the pollution.
"The river is so strong that the booms are being pulled under the
water," Avotins commented.


Avotins said the slick could come to within 120 kilometers (72
miles) of Riga, which sits on the Daugava River, 250 kilometers
from the border with Belarus.
