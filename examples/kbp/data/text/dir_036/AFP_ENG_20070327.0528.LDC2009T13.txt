A panel overseeing a landmark truce between Burundi's government
and the country's last active rebels has suspended its work due
to "irreconcilable" differences, a spokesman said Tuesday.


Ephrem Phako, representing the South African chief mediator, said
members of the rebel National Liberation Forces (FNL) had raised
issues that would require a renegotiation of the ceasefire deal
signed last September. He did not detail the issues.


"The facilitators consider the positions as irreconcilable,"
according to a statement signed by Phako.


The panel's sessions are suspended awaiting the outcome of
consultations with the Burundi peace process mediator Charles
Nqakula, it said.


The government rejected the move arguing that the mandate of the
rebels was only to work on implementing the ceasefire, not to
discuss further issues.


Of Burundi's seven rebel groups, the FNL is the only one left out
of a 2000 peace process that culminated in the election of a
power-sharing government in 2005.


Last month, the FNL joined the government on the ceasefire panel
after months of boycott over demands including the release of
some of their members, who were being held by the government,
including one of their nominees to the panel.


Before its suspension the panel had been discussing ways of
establishing a timetable for the integration of the ex-fighters
into the army or the police and for the demobilisation of those
who will be left out.
