Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin on Tuesday called for a Security
Council mission to Belgrade and Pristina before a proposed UN
plan for Kosovo independence is considered.


Churkin also said there should be a "comprehensive review of
implementation" of a 1999 council resolution on Kosovo's future
status.


The Security Council is due to discuss UN chief mediator Martti
Ahtisaari's Kosovo independence plan, next month, possibly as
early as next week.
