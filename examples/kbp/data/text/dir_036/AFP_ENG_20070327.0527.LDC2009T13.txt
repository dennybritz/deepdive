Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) on
Tuesday claimed that a senior official was abducted at gunpoint
after attending a memorial service of a slain activist.


The party's secretary general Tendai Biti said Last Maengahama, a
deputy secretary for local government, was taken at gunpoint at a
suburban shopping centre by men in plain clothes and driven away
away in a car without registration plates.


"He was a passenger in a car in the company of four other people
when he was approached and taken away," Biti told AFP.


Police have meantime vowed to stamp out what it described as acts
of terrorism after it listed eight cases of petrol bombing in the
country which it blamed on the MDC.


"These are clearly acts of terrorism. The ZRP (police) .. will
not sit idly and allow such acts of terrorism perpetrated on
Zimbabweans," said police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena in a
statement.


The attacks have been aimed at mainly police stations and several
people have been wounded, according to police.
