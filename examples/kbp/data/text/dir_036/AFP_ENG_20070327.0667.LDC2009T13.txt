EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana arrived in Riyadh Wednesday
to urge Arab leaders to seize the "window of opportunity" in the
Middle East peace process and offer full support for their
revived peace initiative.


Solana, who flew in from Brussels to address the annual Arab
League summit in Riyadh, was hoping that a meeting of the
international Middle East peace Quartet -- EU, Russia, UN and
United States -- with key Arab players can be swiftly arranged to
further the peace process.


"We plan for the next Quartet meeting to take place in the region
and if possible another one bringing together the so-called Arab
Quartet," he said.


European sources said that initial plans were being made for a
Quartet meeting at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in the
second half of April.


Eventually it is hoped to get Israel involved in the talks.


The Arab Quartet comprises of Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab
nations with peace deals with Israel, and Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, who are also active in reviving the 2002
Arab peace initiative.


On the eve of two-day summit opening on Wednesday Arab foreign
ministers agreed to revive their peace blueprint which offers
Israel full normalisation of relations if it withdraws from all
lands it occupied in 1967, permits the creation of a Palestinian
state and the return of Palestinian refugees.
