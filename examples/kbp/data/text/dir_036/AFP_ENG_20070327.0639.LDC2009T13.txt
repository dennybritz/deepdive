Former Ireland rugby union forward Trevor Brennan has lodged an
appeal against a lifetime playing ban, the European Rugby Cup
(ERC) announced on Tuesday.


Brennan will also appeal against a suspension from participating
in any tournament organised by the ERC and a fine he received for
punching a supporter during Toulouse's 28-13 European Cup victory
over Ulster in January.


The 33-year-old was fined 25,000 euros and ordered to pay 5,000
euros compensation to the supporter and the costs of convening
the hearing.


The Toulouse star announced his immediate retirement from the
game just days before the hearing in London on March 16.


A date for the appeal to be heard, and the composition of an
independent appeal committee, will be confirmed as soon as
practicable, the ERC said.


Last month the French Rugby Federation banned Brennan until the
disciplinary hearing was complete.
