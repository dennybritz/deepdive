A double from Han Peng inspired China to a 3-1 international
friendly win over Uzbekistan here on Tuesday.


The victory was a welcome boost for the Chinese national side and
under-fire coach Zhu Guanghu, after a 2-0 loss to a second-string
Australia on Saturday.


Han, 24, scored twice in the first half to put China on the road
to victory and the third came from an own-goal off Uzbek Botir
Karaev in the second half.


Uzbekistan fought back after the break with Vladimir Shishelov
scoring a consolation goal.


Chinese head coach Zhu was delighted with the comprehensive
victory against a team ranked 53rd in the world by football
governing body FIFA. China are ranked 75th.


"The match showed China is able to defeat any Asian giants," said
Zhu.
