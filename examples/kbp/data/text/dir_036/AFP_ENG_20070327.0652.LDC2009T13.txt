Hamish Marshall was given permission by the ICC on Tuesday to
join New Zealand's World Cup squad as a replacement for Lou
Vincent who has broken his wrist.


Vincent was injured when he was hit on the arm by fast-bowling
teammate Shane Bond in the nets on Sunday.


Marshall will now make the switch from low-key regional cricket
to the heat of the World Cup in response to the Black Caps'
growing injury crisis.


Marshall was playing for Northern Districts in the New Zealand
Championship final when he got the call to rush to Antigua and he
said is ready to be pitched straight into the team to face West
Indies at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium here on Thursday.


"That's the indication they gave me, that with Ross Taylor still
out with his hamstring injury, basically I'll go straight into
the game," Marshall told New Zealand's Radio Sport.


"There's a scenario I've got to deal with and see how I feel when
I get over there but it shouldn't be too bad."
