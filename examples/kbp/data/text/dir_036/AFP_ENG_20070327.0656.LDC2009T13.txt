The European Union's election mission in Nigeria said on Tuesday
that it had deployed dozens of monitors across the country ahead
of parliamentary elections there next month.


The mission said in a statement that the 66 observers were in the
process of setting up their offices in most states around the
country.


"They plan to meet all political stakeholders such as election
administrators, political parties and candidates, civil society
groups, religious groups and the media," the statement said.


The EU's chief observer, Max van den Berg, told reporters last
week that his team would stay away from the three volatile states
in the oil-rich Niger delta now notorious for kidnapping of
foreigners, mostly oil workers.


"We are not able to be in three states -- Rivers, Delta and
Bayelsa -- because there, the environment for international
observers is not really conducive," Berg said.


Since last year, the three states have accounted for almost all
the kidnapping of more than 100 foreigners, killings of about 40
security officers and destruction of oil facilities.


The EU mission is due to issue a preliminary statement after each
election and a final report within three months of the completion
of the entire poll, he added.


Nigeria has scheduled state parliamentary and governorship
elections for April 14 while presidential and National Assembly
polls are fixed for April 21, to mark the nation's first
civilian-to-civilian transition since its independence in 1960.
