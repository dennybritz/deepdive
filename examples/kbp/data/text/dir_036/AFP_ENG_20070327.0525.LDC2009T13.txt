Italy received a massive boost here Tuesday ahead of their
crucial Euro 2008 qualifying match against Scotland when first-
choice goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon resumed training.


The Juventus keeper sat out Monday's work-out as a precaution
after being laid low by a stomach bug, forcing coach Roberto
Donadoni to call up Udinese's Morgan De Sanctis as cover.


Buffon showed no sign of difficulty as he took part in a full
training session at the San Nicola stadium and is set to start
Wednesday's match.


World champions Italy are five points adrift of joint Group B
leaders France and Scotland, but have a game in hand on their
rivals.
