The Italian Senate voted Tuesday to approve new funds for the
country's military engagement in Afghanistan, a highly sensitive
issue for Prime Minister Romano Prodi's fragile centre-left
coalition.


The measure passed with 180 votes in favour, two against and 132
abstentions, Senate speaker Franco Marini announced.


About 20 of the votes in favour were by Christian Democrat
senators in the opposition.
