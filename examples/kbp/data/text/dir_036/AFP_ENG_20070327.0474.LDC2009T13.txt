British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was cutting
short her visit to Turkey on Tuesday to report to parliament on
the lack of progress in getting 15 British sailors and marines
detained by Iran released.


Beckett told reporters here after meeting Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan that she had decided to return to London
after speaking on the telephone with her Iranian counterpart
Manouchehr Mottaki.


"I discussed (with Mottaki) what developments there have been,
whether we have made any progress in trying to resolve the
issues. Unfortunately, it appears that may not be the case, she
said.


"So, with great regret, I have decided to cut here my visit to
Turkey and go to report to our parliament."


"In the meantime," Beckett said, "we will do everything we can
through every diplomatic channel available to us, but in case
that this is not possible, I have to report now to our
parliament."
