Saudi King Abdullah held a closed-door meeting with Syrian
President Bashar al- Assad in Riyadh Tuesday, the first since
relations chilled after last summer's Lebanon war, a source in
Assad's delegation to an Arab summit here told AFP.


Abdullah earlier greeted and embraced Assad when he flew into a
Riyadh air base to attend the summit opening Wednesday, but a
bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Arab League gathering
had been in doubt.


In a speech last August, Assad said the Israel-Hezbollah war had
"exposed the Arab situation entirely... because it has downed the
people of half positions, or the half men, and brought down all
the tardy positions".


Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal had implicitly
blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah, backed by Damascus and Tehran, for
the devastation wrought by the war which broke out after the
group captured two Israeli soldiers.


Regional newspapers said Assad was criticising the leaders of
pro-US Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, but Syrian Foreign
Minister Walid Muallem said the president was not referring to
any Arab leader.
