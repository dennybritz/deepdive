The US Senate on Tuesday for the first time voted for a provision
that would tie funding for the war in Iraq to a timetable for the
withdrawal of US troops.


Lawmakers in the upper house derailed a Republican effort to
strip from an emergency funding bill a provision requiring US
combat troops to be out of Iraq by March 2008.


The vote was 48 to 50.


The amendment by Senator Thad Cochran and backed by virtually all
of his fellow Republicans, came on the second day of Senate
debate over sending an additional 121.6 billion dollars for the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
