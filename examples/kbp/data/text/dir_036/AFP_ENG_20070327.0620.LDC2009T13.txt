Takeo Spikes, an All-Pro linebacker with nine seasons of National
Football League experience, joined the Philadelphia Eagles here
Tuesday in a deal with the Buffalo Bills.


Spikes, whose name means "great warrior" in Japanese, joined
backup quarterback Kelly Holcomb in departing the Bills for
defensive tackle Darwin Walker and a 2008 NFL Draft pick.


"Takeo Spikes is a proven playmaker. He has the ability to play
all three linebacking positions and we're happy to add him to our
defense," said Eagles general manager Tom Heckert.


Spikes enjoyed his best season in 2004 with 111 tackles, five
interceptions and three sacks. He suffered a torn Achilles tendon
in 2005 and had only 43 tackles last season.


Spikes is due to make 4.5 million dollars this year and five
million in 2008, the last year of his six-year contract.
