Argentina on Tuesday scrapped a deal with Britain to share oil
found off the Falkland Islands, which both countries claim,
Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana said.


Taiana said Argentina made the move to end the cooperation
arrangement because Britain unilaterally opted to put out for
public bid oil deals in the area in the South Atlantic.


"Argentina does not oppose cooperating with the United Kingdom,
so long as this contributes to reopening talks about the islands'
sovereignty," he said.


The two countries went to war 25 years ago on April 2 over
control of the islands.
