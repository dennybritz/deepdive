Batasuna, the political wing of armed Spanish separatist group
ETA, has registered a new political party to try to bypass its
exclusion from upcoming elections, the interior minister said
Tuesday.


"The ministry confirms that a new party has been registered," a
ministry source told AFP.


Spain's Socialist government has said that Batasuna cannot take
part in the May 27 elections in the northern Basque and Navarre
regions unless it breaks definitively with ETA's armed campaign,
which it has so far refused to do.
