Any ultimatum against Iran in the stand-off over Iran's nuclear
programme would be doomed to failure, Russia warned in a foreign
ministry report published on Tuesday.


The Iranian problem "has no solution by force, there is no
alternative to a political-diplomatic settlement", the Russian
foreign policy report said.


The report also argued that the absence of normal relations
between Iran and the United States, Washington's labelling of
Iran as part of the axis of evil and its calls for regime change
only aggravated the situation.


Russia backed new UN Security Council sanctions agreed on the
weekend against Iran because of its refusal to suspend its
uranium enrichment programme.


However, both Moscow and Beijing have called for a peaceful
solution to the crisis.


The United States charges that Iran's nuclear energy programme is
a cover for secretly developing nuclear weapons and has not ruled
out military action to prevent this.


Iran insists its programme is aimed exclusively at producing
nuclear energy.


Russia is building a nuclear power plant at Bushehr in Iran,
despite protests from the United States.
