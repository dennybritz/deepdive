Mozambique's health minister said on Tuesday that the toll from a
massive explosion last week at an arms depot had risen to 117
from just over 100.


"The toll has gone up. There are 117 dead," Health Minister Ivo
Garrido said on national radio. The previous toll was 101.


The main opposition party and some media have accused the
government of negligence over Thursday's incident, when bombs,
mines and ammunition exploded in the country's largest arms
depot.


Debris fell on nearby poor neighbourhoods, triggering fires and
causing panic. Several hundred people have been reported injured.


The government said on Friday that it had created an independent
commission to investigate the explosion that will report back to
President Armando Guebuza within two weeks.


The armoury was built in the 1980s by the Soviet Union during
civil war in the former Portuguese colony in southeast Africa.


There had been at least two previous deadly explosions at the
site, one in January and another back in 1985 when 12 people
died.
