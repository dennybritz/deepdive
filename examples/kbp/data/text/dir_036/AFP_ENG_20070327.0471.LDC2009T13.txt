The new Wembley Stadium will host this year's FA Cup final on May
19, the Football Association (FA) confirmed on Tuesday.


The 90,000-seater national stadium, rebuilt at a cost of
800-million pounds (1.45 billion dollars), has been awarded its
general safety certificate from Brent Council.


FA chief executive Brian Barwick said the announcement was "great
news for football fans in this country and indeed the world
over".


He added: "The Cup final and Wembley Stadium go hand in hand and
everybody at the FA is looking forward to a great day."


The final will be between the winners of next month's semi-finals
between Chelsea and Blackburn; and Manchester United and Watford.
