Iran condemned as "provocative" Tuesday comments by Prime
Minister Tony Blair warning of a "different phase" in British
efforts to secure the release of 15 naval personnel detained by
Iran.


"The media campaigns and provocative ... remarks regarding the
violation of Iranian territorial waters by the British sailors
are doing nothing to help settle the affair," said foreign
ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini.


"The British service personnel entered Iranian waters illegally
and the case will follow its legal and judicial course."


In an interview with GMTV television earlier Tuesday, Blair said
Britain was trying to "pursue this through the diplomatic
channels and make the Iranian government understand these people
have to be released".


"I hope we manage to get them to realise they have to release
them. If not, then this will move into a different phase," he
said.


Blair's official spokesman said London was not looking to
escalate the stand-off and would prefer to resolve the spat
quietly.


But London is clearly seeking to keep up the pressure on Tehran,
which has rejected growing international calls to free the naval
personnel.


Britain has Iraqi backing in its insistence that the 15 sailors
and marines were on "routine" anti-smuggling operations in Iraqi
waters when they were seized at gunpoint in the Shatt al-Arab
waterway.


Iran says they entered its territorial waters illegally.
