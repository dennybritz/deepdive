Australia were 286-5 off 46.2 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against West Indies at the Sir Vivian Richards
Stadium here on Tuesday when rain stopped play.


Matthew Hayden was 153 not out with Shane Watson on 11.


It was Hayden's second successive century after making the
fastest ever World Cup hundred against South Africa on Saturday
at St Kitts.


He has hit 13 fours and four sixes in his innings so far.


It was the highest ever World Cup score made by an Australian and
it was Hayden's ninth one-day international hundred.
