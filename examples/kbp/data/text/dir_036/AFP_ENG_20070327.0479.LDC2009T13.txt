Australia were 223-4 after 40 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against the West Indies here on Tuesday.


Opener Matthew Hayden, who set a World Cup record for the fastest
century against South Africa on Saturday, hit a second successive
ton and was on 105 with Michael Hussey on 7.


It was Hayden's ninth ODI century and it came off 110 deliveries.


Adam Gilchrist had been dismissed when he was caught by
wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin off Daren Powell for seven in the
fifth over.


Captain Ricky Ponting then made a quickfire 35 off 36 balls
before he was run out by a brilliant throw from Ramnaresh Sarwan
in the covers in the 15th over.


Michael Clarke and Hayden then put on 98 for the third wicket
before Clarke went lbw for 41 to Dwayne Bravo with the total on
174.


Andrew Symonds became the fourth man to fall when he was caught
behind off Marlon Samuels with the score on 208. The all-rounder
had made 13.


Australia had struggled in the early conditions making just 10
off the first four overs with Hayden having to wait until his
18th ball for his first run.


West Indies skipper Brian Lara won the toss and elected to field
in the first international match to be played at the new Sir
Vivian Richards Stadium. dj07
