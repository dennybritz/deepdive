Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva, in Mombasa to back
Moscow's bid to host the 2013 world athletics championships,
admitted that she was disappointed because she would not be
competing in the event.


The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) on Tuesday awarded
the 2011 world championships to the South Korean city of Daegu
with Moscow holding the 2013 edition.


"I'm happy that we'll organise the world championships in 2013
but I'm very disappointed because I can't compete with my
compatriots as I've decided that my final worlds will be in
2011," said the 24-year-old Russian.


"I've made up my mind and fixed the date of my retirement but you
never know. Maybe I'll still feel competitive and continue on for
a further year, but at this moment in time I've decided to retire
before 2013."


World record holder Isinbayeva won the Olympic title in 2004,
followed by the world (2005) and European (2006) titles.
