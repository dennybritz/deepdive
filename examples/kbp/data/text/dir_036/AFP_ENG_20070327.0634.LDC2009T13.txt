An antique beer mug presented to French President Jacques Chirac
as an EU going- away present drew criticism from EU-hopeful
Turkey on Tuesday for reportedly depicting an 18th century
Ottoman defeat by the French.


"The European Union should concern itself with the future rather
than the past," Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told
reporters when asked about the mug.


"If the EU has a future vision, it should look to the future," he
said. "Harping on the past does not befit the EU vision."


Turkish newspapers said Tuesday that the mug depicted Napoleon's
1799 victory over Ottoman forces in Egypt and reflected hostility
towards Turkey.


It was given to Chirac as a retirement gift by German Chancellor
Angela Merkel at celebrations of the EU's 50th anniversary at the
weekend.


Merkel is opposed to full membership for Turkey and has instead
advocated a special partnership with the sizeable mainly Muslim
country.


Turkey's bid suffered a serious blow in December when the EU
froze its membership talks in eight of the 35 policy areas that
candidates are required to complete in response to Ankara's
refusal to grant trade privileges to Cyprus.
