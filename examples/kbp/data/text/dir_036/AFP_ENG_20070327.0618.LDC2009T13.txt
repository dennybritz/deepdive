An early goal from Vagner Love lifted Brazil to an uninspiring
1-0 win against Ghana in an international football friendly here
on Tuesday.


Carlos Dunga, who counted on the strike force trio of Ronaldinho,
Kaka and Robinho in a 4-0 friendly win over Chile at the weekend,
opted for a more defensive lineup against the Africans.


The Brazil coach made numerous substitutions in order to give a
maximum number of players a run out in a tie being used as a
warm-up for their Copa America title defence this summer.


And CSKA Moscow striker Love scored the winner for the five-time
world champions off a corner after 17 minutes.


Claude Leroy's Ghana could not find the equaliser and were not
helped when midfielder Haminu Dramani was given his marching
orders after 78 minutes.


The last time the two teams met was in the World Cup finals last
year with Brazil winning 3-0 to advance to the quarter-finals.


"It was a physical and tough match for us. I'm very satisfied
that we won," said Dunga. "It wasn't so easy to play at this
level ... But I'm satisifed with these two matches."


Leroy added: "I think we deserved to equalise, we had the
chances.


"I don't like losing and it's the first defeat in seven matches
since I took over the national team, but overall I'm pleased with
our game."
