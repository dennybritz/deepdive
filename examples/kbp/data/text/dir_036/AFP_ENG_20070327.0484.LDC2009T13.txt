ITT Corp. agreed to pay a 100-million-dollar criminal fine for
illegally exporting night vision technology to China, US
authorities said Tuesday,


ITT, which is the leading manufacturer of night vision equipment
for the US armed forces, acknowledged the sale and became the
first major defense contractor convicted of a criminal violation
of the Arms Export Control Act, the Justice Department said.


According to a plea agreement to be filed in US District Court in
Roanoke, Virginia, ITT will plead guilty to one count each of
export of defense articles without a license and omission of
statements of material facts in arms exports reports.


"The sensitive night vision systems produced by ITT Corporation
are critical to US war-fighting capability and are sought by our
enemies and allies alike," said Assistant Attorney General
Kenneth Wainstein.


"ITT's exportation of this sensitive technology to China and
other nations jeopardized our national security and the safety of
our military men and women on the battlefield."


The US official said the prosecution "addresses the violations of
the past, ensures compliance in the future, and serves as a
strong warning to others who might be tempted by the profits of
such illegal exports."
