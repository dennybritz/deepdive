Russian authorities said on Tuesday they had closed more than 20
mines in Siberia following safety checks launched after a mine
explosion last week killed 108 people.


"We have closed more than 20 mines where the concentration of gas
was a bit above normal," said Aman Tuleyev, governor of the
Kemerovo region in western Siberia where the accident took place.


"That means the amount of coal extracted will be reduced, but we
have no other choice."


In comments cited by Interfax news agency, Tuleyv called on the
owners of the closed mines to make use of new technology to
improve safety standards.


On Monday, Russia's industrial safety agency (Rostekhnadzor)
blamed last week's explosion at the Ulyanovskaya mine on "serious
breaches" of safety rules and began checking mine conditions
across the country.


Rostekhnadzor said the closed mines would only be affected for
five days until the results of the safety checks could be handed
over to the courts.


The Ulyanovskaya mine was run by Yuzhkuzbassugol, a company owned
by the Evraz metals giant in which Russian billionaire Roman
Abramovich holds a 41-percent stake.
