Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said in Riyadh on Tuesday
that a revived Arab initiative offers the best chance for Middle
East peace in the near future.


"If this initiative is destroyed, I do not believe that a better
chance for peace will present itself in the near future," Abbas
told AFP.


He spoke shortly after arriving in the Saudi capital on the eve
of a two-day Arab summit that is set to revive a long dormant
Arab peace plan that was first adopted five years ago.


"I think the Arab initiative is the most precious and important
(plan) proposed since 1948 for a solution of the Palestinian
problem and the occupation," Abbas said.


"The initiative offers solutions and simply tells the Israelis:
get out of the Palestinians' lands," he said.


The Arab summit opening on Wednesday is poised to revive the 2002
plan offering Israel full normalisation of relations if it
withdraws from all lands it occupied in 1967, and permits the
creation of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian
refugees.


Abbas said the summit would set up committees that "will explain
the initiative to the world and strive to implement it."


Asked if the envoys would also meet Israeli officials, Abbas
said: "We must talk to everyone, we are talking to our Arab
brothers."


The committees "will meet the Israelis if need be," Palestinian
foreign minister Ziad Abu Amr told AFP.
