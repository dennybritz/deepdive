Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said Tuesday his government
would offer an amnesty to all militant youths in the oil-rich but
volatile Niger Delta who renounced violence.


"There will be genuine amnesty for those who turn new leaf and
hand over their weapons but I will not give amnesty to somebody
who will point a gun at the head of somebody," Obasanjo said.


"I dare say to you that if you are a militant, I am a militant
too. If you do not want me to show you my militancy, then do not
show me that you are one," the president warned.


Obasanjo said that the government would no longer tolerate the
kidnapping of foreign workers that has led to increased
insecurity and damaged the much-needed development of
infrastructure in the southern region.


Since last year, three Niger Delta states -- Bayelsa, Delta and
Rivers -- have seen almost all the kidnappings of more than 100
foreigners, as well as the killings of about 40 security officers
and the destruction of many oil facilities.
