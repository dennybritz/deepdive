Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell in Nigeria on Tuesday confirmed that
the federal government had charged it with the alleged loss of
some "radioactive tools" belonging to one of its contractors.


The company said in a statement that it was " aware that the
federal government has filed some charges at the Federal High
Court in Abuja against SPDC and some other corporate
organisations."


Shell is officially known as the Shell Petroleum Development
Corporation (SDPC).


The main charge against the SPDC is that it allegedly stored,
handled and transported radioactive sources from the jetty to the
rig site without authorisation from the Nigerian Nuclear
Regulatory Authority, the company said.


Shell denied media reports on Tuesday that its managing director
had been charged along with 19 other persons in connection with
an alleged dumping of toxic waste in Nigeria.


The company also denied the charge against it. No date has yet
been fixed for hearing in the matter.
