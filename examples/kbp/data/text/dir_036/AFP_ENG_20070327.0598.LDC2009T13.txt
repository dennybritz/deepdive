US shares posted losses Tuesday as investors appeared unsettled
by a weaker- than-expected snapshot on consumer spending and
lingering troubles affecting the nation's housing market.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 71.46 points (0.57
percent) at 12,397.61 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite finished 18.20 points (0.74 percent) lower
at 2,437.43 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500
dropped 8.83 points (0.61 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,428.67.


The softer-than-expected reading on US consumer confidence fueled
worries that the housing market slump might dent consumer
spending, which accounts for two- thirds of US economic activity.


Stocks fell after the Conference Board reported that its consumer
confidence index fell to 107.2 from 111.2 in February.


Home builder stocks weakened amid ongoing concerns about the
sector and after Lennar Homes reported a drop in first quarter
revenues.
