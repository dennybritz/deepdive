George Gillett and Tom Hicks have completed their takeover of
Premiership club Liverpool in just eight weeks compared to the
more lengthy process at Manchester United.


Gillett and Hicks announced on Tuesday they had secured 98.6
percent of the club's shares, and would now apply to take the
club into private ownership, ending the need to hold annual
general meetings.


It was the final act of the high-speed takeover, in sharp
contrast to the controversial deal when another American, Malcolm
Glazer, took control of Manchester United.


The difference between the two deals could not be a greater
contrast, the Glazer family having held United shares a full two
years before they mounted their takeover bid.


From the day that United's board recommended not to accept
Glazer's original offer - October 25, 2004 - there was eight
months of bitter fighting with shareholders before the Old
Trafford club was finally sold in June 2005.


How different has been Liverpool's transition into American
hands. It was on January 29 when the club's board first rejected
the Dubai bid and opted to give Hicks and Gillett the chance to
mount their own move.


And on Tuesday it was almost eight weeks to the day that it has
taken to secure the full sale of the club, with chairman David
Moores picking up 88 million pounds for his majority
shareholding.
