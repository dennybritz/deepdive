Hundreds of right-wing Jewish settlers got ready on Tuesday to
spend a second night under army protection in a West Bank
settlement cleared as part of Israel's so-called disengagement
plan in 2005.


The settlers, many with children, have vowed to reoccupy the
abandoned Homesh settlement and rebuild homes the Israeli army
razed there a year and a half ago.


"We will stay here until they remove us by force. And afterward,
we will come back," Yossi Dagan, a former resident of a
neighbouring settlement, vowed to AFP.


The settlers marched into Homesh under army protection on Monday
and spent the night there, although authorities had originally
said they would not be allowed to remain past nightfall.


Army radio said soldiers and police would move to evacuate the
settlers from the site early on Wednesday.


"We are regularly evaluating the situation," a military source
said.


Israeli peace groups have blasted the army for caving into right-
wing threats and allowing the march on the evacuated settlement.


Homesh, which was established as a military outpost in 1978, was
turned over to settlers in 1980. Many of its 70 families were
pious and militant zealots who believed they were doing God's
work resettling their biblical homeland of Samaria.


Then prime minister Ariel Sharon evacuated Homesh and three other
West Bank settlements as part of the now-defunct plan for a
partial withdrawal from the West Bank.


He also evacuated 21 settlements and all army outposts from the
Gaza Strip after a 38-year occupation.
