Portugal on Tuesday provided nine new EU members with a software
programme that will allow them to join the document free travel
zone in December.


The programme was given to the justice or interior ministers of
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta,
Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia at a ceremony presided by Prime
Minister Jose Socrates.


It will allow the new European Union countries to share
information about people and goods through the Schengen
Information System, a key requirement of membership in the no-
borders zone.


"Access to the Schengen information system is essential for us to
be able to eliminate border controls," said Socrates.


Without the programme, developed jointly by Portuguese border
control agency SEF and software firm Critical Software, the nine
nations would only be ready to join the zone at the end of 2008
at the earliest, the Portuguese government said in a statement.


The Schengen treaty, which abolished border checks between its
members, counts 15 participating countries: all the oldest EU
members except Britain and Ireland, plus non-EU nations Norway
and Iceland.


The nine nations can integrate into the Schengen free-movement
zone between December 2007 and March 2008 provided they fulfill
all membership conditions according to a recently adopted
timetable.
