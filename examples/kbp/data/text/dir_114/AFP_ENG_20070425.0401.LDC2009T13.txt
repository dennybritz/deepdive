EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Iran's nuclear
negotiator Ali Larijani started a meeting in Ankara Wednesday on
breaking the standoff over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme.


Solana's spokeswoman Cristina Gallach sent phone text messages to
journalists confirming that the meeting had begun.


Solana had earlier told reporters that he hoped "this time we
will be able to move on in preparatory talks that may lead, the
sooner the better, to meaningful negotiations."


Solana and Larijanai were meeting in a new attempt to find a way
through the crisis sparked by Iran's defiance of UN Security
Council demands to halt uranium enrichment.


Iran denies US and EU charges that it is trying to build nuclear
weapons, saying its programme is a legitimate effort to generate
civilian nuclear power.


Larijani told reporters that the talks with Solana aimed to
evaluate "new ideas" that might be put on the table, the Anatolia
news agency said.
