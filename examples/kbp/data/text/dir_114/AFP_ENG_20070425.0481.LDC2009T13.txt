Riot police were deployed in Lusaka Wednesday as the authorities
razed dozens of makeshift markets and other businesses in an
operation designed to clean up the Zambian capital.


A combined team of state police and local authority workers
carried out the demolitions as the riot police chased away
vendors who tried in vain to save their stalls, Lusaka City
Council spokesperson Chanda Mukanta told AFP.


"The demolitions carried out today were targeted at makeshift
markets and stalls," Munkata said.


"We gave them warnings but they opted not to move out on their
own," Mukanta said.


The demolition of the stalls comes amid a similar operation
involving the razing of makeshift housing in unauthorised
shantytowns.
