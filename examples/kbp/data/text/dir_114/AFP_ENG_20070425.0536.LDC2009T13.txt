Some 20,000 designer bags bearing the slogan "I'm not a plastic
bag" sold out within an hour of going on sale at British
supermarket chain Sainsbury's, the retailer said Wednesday.


Shoppers queued outside 450 Sainsbury's stores before opening
time in order to snap up the Anya Hindmarch bags for five pounds
(7.3 euros, 10 dollars).


The reusable cotton bags became a must-have item for the fashion
conscious after a string of celebrities were photographed with
them during London Fashion Week in February.


Sainsbury's spokeswoman Hannah Chance said tickets were handed
out to shoppers queuing for the bags before stores opened at 8:00
am (0700 GMT). Only 30 bags were sold per store.


"They sold out in just under an hour across the UK. People were
queuing during the night and there were a lot of queues at stores
from 6:00 am today," she said.


Scores of the bags were later attracting bids of up to 100 pounds
on Internet auction site eBay.


Hindmarch designed the bags for the We Are What We Do
environmental movement to cut down on the number of plastic bags
being used.


The group said the bag was meant to be sold on a not-for-profit
basis for five pounds to help the environment rather than being
auctioned.
