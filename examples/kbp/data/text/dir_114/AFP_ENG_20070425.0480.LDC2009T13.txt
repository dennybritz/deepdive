An Argentine court on Wednesday canceled pardons granted in 1990
to former members of the country's dictatorship convicted of
human rights violations, judicial sources said.


The court said the pardons granted by then-president Carlos Menem
to nine former members of the military junta were
unconstitutional, the source said.


The former member of the dictatorship had been sentenced to life
imprisonment for human rights violations.
