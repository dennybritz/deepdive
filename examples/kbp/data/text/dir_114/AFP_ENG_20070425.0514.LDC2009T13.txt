A 20-party Nigerian opposition coalition, including the country's
two heavweights, called Wednesday for mass protests to force the
cancellation of election results it said were flawed.


"We are calling for massive protests but peaceful protests. May 1
should be the first day but there should be others," Ben Obi, the
vice presidential candidate of the opposition Action Congress
(AC) party, told journalists.


The coalition also includes the All Nigerian People's Party
(ANPP). Candidates fielded by the ANPP and AC respectively came
second and third in the disputed April 21 presidential poll.


The parties called on Nigerians to use Labour Day "to reject the
sham elections of 14th and 21st and to call for their
cancellation".


Protests should be accompanied by prayers in mosques and
churches, they said.


They demanded fresh elections, which they said should be
organised by a transitional government that would be headed
initially by the president of the senate and later, at the
expiration of his tenure, by the nation's chief justice.


The parties also called for the dissolution of the electoral
commission INEC and for the removal from office of the inspector
general of police.


They further called on the Senate to pass a resolution "rejecting
sham elections and cancelling illegitimate results".
