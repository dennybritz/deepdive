Italy's Davide Rebellin, riding for the Gerolsteiner team, won
the Fleche Wallonne one-day classic for the second time here on
Wednesday.


The 2004 titleholder easily accounted for the last two winners of
the ProTour event, Spain's Alejandro Valverde and fellow Italian
Danilo Di Luca who came in six seconds adrift.


In the final 200m Rebellin sprinted past German Matthias Kessler,
who had led over the third and final climb at Huy to eventually
take fourth.


A trio of riders - Joaquim Rodriguez, Di Luca and Valverde - had
taken the race by the scruff of the neck 10 kilometres from the
end, only to be caught two kilometres from the 202.5km finish.


Rebellin reflected: "I wanted to leave everything to the (final)
climb. If the peloton arrived together, I had a chance. But we
risked a lot with Di Luca and Valverde's breakaway. We found
ourselves in danger.


"We were lucky that they were caught. On the climb, Astana worked
really hard. Vino (Alexander Vinokourov) set up Kessler and I
passed him with 150m left."


The 35-year-old Venice-born winner, was building on his second
place to teammate Stefan Schumacher in Sunday's Amstel Gold Race.


Valverde admitted that tactically he had not quite called it
right on the final climb.


"Danilo Di Luca was a bit annoyed with me because I didn't work
with him on the counter-attack but my team-mate Joaquim Rodriguez
was out in front (at the time).


"I didn't realise how close the peloton was."
