Injury-plagued pitcher Mark Prior, who underwent shoulder surgery
on Tuesday, will miss the rest of the season, the Chicago Cubs
announced on Wednesday.


Once among the top power pitchers in Major League Baseball, Prior
has been plagued by a litany of injuries over the past three
seasons. The injuries have limited Prior to a total of 57 starts
over that stretch - including just nine last year.


He entered spring training vying for the fifth spot in Chicago's
rotation but struggled in limited action, going 0-2 with a 6.97
ERA before being optioned to the minors on March 28.


Selected second overall in 2001, Prior made 19 starts with the
Cubs that season before emerging as an ace in the following
campaign, going 18-6 with a 2.43 ERA and 245 strikeouts.
