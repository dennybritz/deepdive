Journalists at Denmark's public radio and television broadcaster
Danmarks Radio (DR) walked off the job on Wednesday to protest
the closure of DR's sports service, the broadcaster said.


The strike was due to last until midnight (2200 GMT).


The closure of the sports service is part of a plan presented by
management on Tuesday to save 287.5 million kroner (38.5 million
euros, 52.6 million dollars) per year from 2008 to 2011.


The plan also entails 275 lay-offs, including many jobs in the
administrative division.


Management said the cutbacks were necessary because the
construction of a new headquarters has exceeded its budget.


The project has run 1.7 billion kroner (228 million euros, 301
million dollars) over budget and was now expected to cost 4.7
billion kroner (630 million euros, 834 million dollars).


DR is Denmark's biggest television and radio broadcaster. Founded
in 1925, it has two television channels and four radio channels.
