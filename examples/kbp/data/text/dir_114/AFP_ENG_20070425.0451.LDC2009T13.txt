The NATO force in Afghanistan said Wednesday it had pulled a
radio advert that had been on air in the top opium-producing area
after complaints it appeared to condone cultivation of the drug.


The NATO-sponsored advert broadcast in Helmand province had been
"ambiguous and open to misinterpretation," Lieutenant Colonel
Maria Carl, spokeswoman for NATO's International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF), told reporters.


It reportedly said NATO understood many Afghans depended on the
cultivation of opium poppies and its troops were not in the
country to take part in government campaigns to eradicate poppy
fields.


ISAF troops, trying to win "hearts and minds" among people
suspicious of foreigners, are helping the government to extend
its authority, including into areas under the sway of Taliban
extremists in cahoots with drug lords.


But they are not involved in drives to destroy poppy fields that
have met with fierce resistance from farmers, some of whom have
attacked eradication teams.


Despite international efforts costing millions of dollars,
Afghanistan's opium cultivation rose 59 percent last year to a
record 165,000 hectares (407,550 acres).


The southern province of Helmand, where ISAF is engaged in a
major operation against the Taliban and its allies, produces more
than 40 percent of the country's opium in a trade worth about
three billion dollars a year.
