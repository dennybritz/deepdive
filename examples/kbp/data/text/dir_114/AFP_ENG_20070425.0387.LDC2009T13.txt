A Spanish hospital boat crew found two people dead onboard a
vessel carrying 87 would-be African immigrants which was adrift
off the coast of Mauritania, a diplomatic source said Wednesday.


The migrants said they had thrown overboard the bodies of about
ten other passengers who died as the ship made its way to Spain's
Canary Islands, the source said.


Twenty-five of the survivors were treated for dehydration and
other ailments onboard the hospital ship Esperanza del Mar.


The migrant ship was first spotted by a Spanish fishing boat on
Monday which then sounded the alarm.


Spain then asked Mauritanian authorities to send help but they
refused, arguing the boat migrants had been picked up outside of
their territorial waters, Spanish media reported.


Spanish authorities were seeking to have the migrants returned to
Senegal as the boat is believed to have set sail form the West
African nation.


More than 31,000 illegal immigrants reached the Canary Islands
from West Africa last year, six times more than in 2005. Many
others died on the journey.


But tighter maritime surveillance has led to a sharp drop in
arrivals to the archipelago this year. Only 1,525 migrans arrived
on the Canary Islands during the first three months of 2007, a 61
percent drop over the same time last year.
