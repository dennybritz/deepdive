Government data Wednesday showed US new home sales rebounded 2.6
percent in April to show some life in the struggling real estate
sector, but the rise was below most private forecasts.


New home sales reached an annualized pace of 858,000 units, the
Commerce Department said, below the average Wall Street forecast
for a pace of 890,000.


The level of sales remained 23.5 percent below last year's pace,
reflecting the slump in what had been a sizzling property market
for several years.


The government revised down its estimates for new home sales for
March to an annualized rate of 836,000 instead of 848,000 and for
February to 873,000 from 882,000.


The median sales price was up 6.4 percent from a year ago to
254,000 dollars.


But new home inventories, an indicator of future trends, showed a
rise of 0.2 percent to 545,000 units in March. That represents a
7.8 percent supply at the current sales pace.


The report came a day after industry data showed the biggest
monthly fall in over 18 years in existing home sales, which
represents a much bigger share of the overall real estate market.


The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday existing US
home sales sank a heavy 8.4 percent to an annualized pace of 6.12
million units in March.
