German airline Lufthansa said on Wednesday it was back in profit
in the first quarter of the year after selling its stake in
holiday specialist Thomas Cook.


It reported a net profit of 554 million euros (756 million
dollars) for the period, compared with a net loss of 98 millions
euros at the same time last year.


The first quarter of the year tends to be the quietest period for
Lufthansa.


The result was better than forecast by analysts questioned by the
Thomson Financial newswire.


The company also reported a better-than-expected operating profit
of 36 million euros, against a net operating loss of 75 million
in the same period last year. Analysts had expected an operating
loss of 8.6 million euros.


Sales progressed by 7.0 percent to 4.7 billion euros.


Its first-quarter profits benefited from an extraordinary gain of
499 million euros from the sale of 50 percent of Thomas Cook, it
said, adding that its Swiss subsidiary also contributed to the
good results.
