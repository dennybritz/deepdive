An Argentine court on Wednesday canceled pardons granted in 1990
to former members of the country's military government convicted
of human rights violations, court sources said.


The court said the pardons granted by then-president Carlos Menem
to nine former members of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship
were unconstitutional, the source said.


The former officials were given prison sentences ranging from
several years to life in 1985 for human rights violations
committed during the dictatorship, which is blamed for the
"disappearance" of 30,000 people widely believed to have been
killed.


Several more leading former military and police officers face
trial in connection with the killings, abduction and torture
carried out by the military government.


In 2005 the Supreme Court overturned amnesty laws that protected
some former members of the military dictatorship.
