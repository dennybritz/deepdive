Former US vice president Al Gore said Wednesday he would like to
see the environment play a larger role in the 2008 presidential
campaign and that the issue would likely move up the agenda in
the coming months.


"I think there should be a much greater focus" on environmental
issues, Gore told reporters in New York, adding that the climate
change debate was reaching a "tipping point" where it was
accepted as a central part of people's lives.


"I think we have a chance to see the same thing happening in the
presidential campaign," he said. "This discussion may become
really front and center" in the months ahead, he continued,
adding: "I hope so."


Since losing the presidential election to George W. Bush in 2000,
Gore has devoted his time to raising climate change awareness,
notably with his global warming lecture series featured in the
documentary "An Inconvenient Truth."


Despite speculation that he could again make a run for the White
House, Gore has repeatedly stressed that he has no immediate plan
to run for office.
