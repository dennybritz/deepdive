Bangladesh's emergency government which had been trying to exile
two former prime ministers on Wednesday said it would drop a ban
on Sheikh Hasina Wajed returning to the country and stated there
would be no restriction on the movements of Khaleda Zia.


"The government says clearly that there is no pressure on Khaleda
Zia to go abroad and there have been no restrictions on her
movements," the government said in a statement, read out by
information officer Makhan Lal Hira. Zia has been under virtual
house arrest.


The government had also withdrawn a press note issued on April
18, the statement said, referring to a ban imposed on Sheikh
Hasina entering the country.
