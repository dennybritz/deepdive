Manchester United and AS Roma were both fined by UEFA on
Wednesday over the violence which erupted during their Champions
League quarter-final in Rome this month.


European football's governing body acted after rival sets of
supporters threw missiles at each other and clashed with Italian
police, who were heavily criticised for their behaviour by United
supporters following the incident at Stadio Olimpico in Rome.


Roma were fined 47,000 euros with United having to pay 21,300.


The clubs have the right to appeal the decision imposed by UEFA's
control and disciplinary body.


Roma won that first leg 2-1 before a 7-1 drubbing in the second
leg at Old Trafford.


At a separate hearing UEFA announced that European champions
Greece must play their next two Euro 2008 qualifiers against
Hungary and Moldova at least 250km away from the Greek capital
Athens.


This punishment follows trouble at the Georgios Karaiskakis
stadium during Greece's 4-1 defeat by Turkey which included
fireworks and missiles being thrown, racist banners displayed and
a general lack of organisation.


The Greek football federation has also been ordered to ban
extremist supporter groups from matches of the Greek national
teams and to pay a 61,000 euro fine.


And the Norwegian Football Association and the Football
Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina picked up fines of 18,300 and
36,600 euros respectively after crowd trouble at their Euro
qualifier in Oslo which Bosnia won 2-1.
