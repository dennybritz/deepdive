Belgian economic growth slowed slightly in the first quarter to
0.6 percent from 0.7 percent in the last three months of 2006,
the Belgian central bank said Wednesday in a first estimate.


Compared to the same period of 2006, growth eased to 2.8 percent
in the first three months of this year from 3.0 percent in the
final quarter of last year, the National Bank of Belgium said.


A sharp drop in construction activity weighed on growth in the
first quarter, although business was also slower in the services
and industrial sectors.


However, the economy benefited from sustained foreign demand,
which boosted exports in the face of weak domestic demand.
