Italian Damiano Cunego, riding for the Lampre team, won the
second stage of the Tour of Trentino on Wednesday, a 144km ride
from Santa Massenza to Predaia.


The 26-year-old, a winner of this race in 2004 and 2006, was also
first home in Tuesday's first stage.


Cunego overhauled his compatriot Michele Scarponi 600 from the
line to establish a 14 second lead over his compatriot in the
overall standings.


Thursday's penultimate stage is a 176km run between Cavareno and
Maderno.
