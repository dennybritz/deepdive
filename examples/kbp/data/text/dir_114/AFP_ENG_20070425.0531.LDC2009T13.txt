At least 59 British civilians have died in Iraq since the start
of the US-led invasion in March 2003, the government in London
said on Wednesday.


But the real figure could be higher because only cases where
British consular assistance has been sought are recorded, Foreign
Office minister Kim Howells said in a written answer to the House
of Commons.


"Our consular records show that at least 59 British civilians
have died in Iraq since March 2003," he said.


"This number includes death from natural causes, but is not a
definitive figure as records include only those cases where
consular assistance has been sought.


"The figure does not include British dual nationals or
unrepresented foreign nationals."


Howells was responding to a lawmaker's question that asked "How
many British civilians have died in Iraq in violent circumstances
since the beginning of March 2003."


The death toll for British military personnel in Iraq in the same
period currently stands at 145.


Civilians who have lost their lives in Iraq include engineer Ken
Bigley, who was beheaded after being held hostage in 2004.


Merrick McDonald, a former bodyguard to Real Madrid and former
England footballer David Beckham, died in a car bomb attack in
2006 while working for a private security firm in Baghdad.
