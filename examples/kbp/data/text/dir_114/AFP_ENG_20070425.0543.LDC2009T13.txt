Ex-Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya was slapped with a
10,000 dollar fine Wednesday for a rude gesture during a NASCAR
Busch Series practice session in Phoenix.


The Colombian was handed the fine and placed on probation until
December 31 for raising his finger to a cameraman last week.


The racing series said Montoya's action - which was captured live
on US television - was "detrimental to stock car racing."


Montoya, a former Indianapolis 500 winner, told ESPN television
that he accepted the punishment but added the gesture was made in
fun and not with malice toward anyone.


"I really feel bad that the incident happened," Montoya said. "It
was only meant as a joke to one of my friends. I completely
understand NASCAR's point of view and their decision."
