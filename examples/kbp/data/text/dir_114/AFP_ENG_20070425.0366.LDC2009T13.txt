If you were an astronaut, zipping around Earth at an altitude of
400 kilometers (250 miles), what music would you like to hear?


How about Monty Python's "Always Look on the Bright Side of
Life," for an unfailing morale boost?


Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Bad Moon Rising" for a touch of
celestial rockabilly?


The Rolling Stones' "2,000 Light Years from Home" for occasional
consolation that someone else has felt as alienated as you?


The European Space Agency (ESA) on Wednesday unveiled a
competition to find a set of 10 tunes that will be quite
literally out of this world.


Youngsters are being invited to suggest a playlist of 10 songs
that will entertain, support or inspire the crew of the
International Space Station (ISS). Any kind of song can be
suggested.


The tunes will be downloaded onto an iPod and sent to the ISS
aboard ESA's robot space truck, the Automated Transfer Vehicle
(ATV), which is designed to bring food, water, air and other
supplies to mankind's orbital outpost.


The grand prize is a trip to see the ATV's maiden launch in
Kourou, French Guiana, later this year.


The competition is open to youngsters aged under 18 who are
nationals of countries taking part in the ATV programme (Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland).
