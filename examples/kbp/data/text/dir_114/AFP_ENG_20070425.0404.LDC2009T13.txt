British Prime Minister Tony Blair will pay a flying visit to
Poland at the end of the week, the Polish presidency said
Wednesday.


During the visit, which will last just a few hours on Friday,
Blair will hold talks with his Polish counterpart, Jaroslaw
Kaczynski, and President Lech Kaczynski, the Polish premier's
twin brother, the president's office said in a statement.


The presidency did not give details of the purpose of the visit.


Poland and Britain are key allies of Washington in the so-called
war against terror.


Both countries have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Poland is
holding preliminary talks with Washington about hosting missiles
for a defence shield the United States wants to extend to central
Europe.


Britain already houses part of the defence system.


Britain was also among three older European Union member states,
along with Sweden and Ireland, to open its doors to workers from
eight former communist states, including Poland, that joined the
EU in 2004 along with Cyprus and Malta.


Several hundred thousand Poles have since moved to Britain to
work.
