Spain's reform-minded Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
tops a list of people Spaniards would like to have a beer with,
according to a poll published Wednesday.


More than one in 10 people named Zapatero, who has championed
women's rights and approved gay marriage since taking office in
2004, when asked who they would like to have a beer with, the
Ipsos poll found.


Zapatero topped the poll last year as well.


The Socialist prime minister, with 11.8 percent of preferences,
came in ahead of Oscar-nominated Spanish actress Penelope Cruz
who was named by six percent of respondents.


Spain's reigning two-time Formula One world champion Fernando
Alonso came in third place with 5.9 percent.


The poll was carried out among 2,000 people for Spain's beer
producers association between March 1 and 12.
