Zambian authorities have shut down a copper smelter plant at one
of the country's key mines following a blast that severely
injured four miners and led to a strike by some workers.


The Mine Safety Department ordered Chambishi Metals to suspend
its operations after the copper mine experienced three major
accidents since last October, company managing director Derek
Webbstock said.


"We have been instructed to suspend operations until the cause of
the accidents are determined," Webbstock said.


More than 160 workers have gone on an indefinite strike at the
mine demanding the removal of their manager at the smelter whom
they accuse of ignoring basic safety standards for miners, state-
run Times of Zambia said.


The report said such accidents could be avoided if safety
measures were put in place by the owners of the mines, a group of
foreign investors and the Zambian government which has minority
shares.


Mine accidents in Zambia have increased in recent years after the
mining assets where sold to foreign investors who are accused of
ignoring safety measures in their operation.


In 2005, over 50 Zambian workers died at a nearby Chinese-run
copper mine after a powerful explosion ripped through the plant.
