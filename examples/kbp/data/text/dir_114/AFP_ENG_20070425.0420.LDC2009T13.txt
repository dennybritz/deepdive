A new drug for treating infections by the  yeast Candida is as
effective as the main existing treatment but has fewer side
effects, according to research published online Thursday by The
Lancet.


Candida is a range of fungi that notoriously cause a vaginal
infection called thrush, also known as yeast infection, as well
as sore throats and sepsis, an infection of the blood that can be
life-threatening.


The new drug, micafungin (trade name Mycamine), was tested among
531 adult patients in a comparison with the benchmark treatment,
liposomal amphotericin B.


The success rate, of 89.6 percent, was the same for both drugs,
but micafungin caused fewer kidney problems, according to the
authors, led by Oliver Cornely of University Hospital Cologne,
Germany.
