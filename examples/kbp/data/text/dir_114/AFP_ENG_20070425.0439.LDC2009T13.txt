The chief executive of Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering
company, is to step down later this year, the company announced
on Wednesday.


"Dr. Klaus Kleinfeld, president and CEO of Siemens, has announced
that he is not available for a renewal of his contract which
expires on September 30, 2007," the company said in a terse
statement.


Members of the Siemens advisory board had said in recent days
that the company needed to make a fresh start with new management
as it contended with an ongoing slush-fund probe.


Kleinfeld has not been implicated in the investigation.
