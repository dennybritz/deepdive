Austrian skier Marlies Schild was airlifted to hospital on
Wednesday after suffering concussion during a training crash,
according to her doctor.


This season's slalom World Cup winner was training at Stubai,
450km from Vienna, when she suffered the crash, that also saw her
injure her thumb and knee.


"Marlies Schild's injuries are not serious," insisted Dr
Christian Fink from the clinic at the University of Innsbruck.


He said the 25-year-old would spend the night in hospital under
observation as a precaution.


Schild's coach Jurgen Graller said: "She was descending a steep
slope and made a mistake on a bend and fell head first into the
hard snow.


"When she regained consciousness she didn't know what had
happened last week and what was planned for this week."


Fink said she would need two weeks to recover from her injuries.


Schild is the girlfriend of another Austrian skier Benjamin
Raich, also the World Cup slalom champion and like Schild the
runner-up in the overall World Cup standings.
