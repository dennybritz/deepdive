Eight companies and consortiums have submitted bids to buy a
majority stake in Bosnia's sole aluminium plant, ONASA news
agency reported Wednesday.


Among the bidders is Switzerland's Glencore whose recent merger
with Russian aluminium producers Rusal and Sual formed the
world's number one aluminium producer.


Other companies bidding for the 88-percent stake in Aluminij
Mostar valued at about 77 million euros (100 million dollars)
include India's biggest aluminium producer Hindalco Industries
Limited and Vedanta Resources, an India-based mining group, ONASA
said.


Due diligence is to start on May 7, while companies to be
included in a shortlist of buyers will have to submit detailed
offers by June 26.


Aluminij Mostar, which has almost 1,000 workers, is Bosnia's
leading exporter. Last year the company exported 121,000 tonnes
of metals worth about 240 million euros (327 million dollars).


Bosnia is still recovering from the 1992-1995 war that claimed
some 200,000 lives and destroyed almost all infrastructure and
the economy in the country. anh/zbl/adp
