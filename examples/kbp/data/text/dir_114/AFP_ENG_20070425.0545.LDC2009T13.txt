Former US vice president Al Gore said Wednesday he initially
thought making his climate change lectures into the Oscar-winning
documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" was a serious mistake.


"I have to fess up that when I was approached to make my slide
show into a movie, I thought it was a terrible idea," Gore told
reporters in New York. "I had to be talked into it and I'm glad
that I was talked into it."


The hard-hitting rallying cry against global environmental
catastrophe went on to become one of the biggest grossing
documentaries at the North American box office and this year
picked up two Oscars, including best documentary.
