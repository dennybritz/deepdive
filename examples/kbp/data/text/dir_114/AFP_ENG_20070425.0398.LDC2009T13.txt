The head of Ethiopia's eastern Somali region on Wednesday told
AFP that 77 people had died in a rebel attack the previous day on
a Chinese oil venture, including three more Ethiopian victims.


"I am aware as of now that a total of 77 people had been killed
in the attacks, including nine Chinese," said Abdulahi Hassen.


"I don't yet have details about the number of wounded."


A previous Ethiopian government toll said 74 had been killed in
the dawn raid, including 65 Ethiopian workers.


The Ogaden National Liberation Front claimed responsibility for
Tuesday's attack in a statement on its website in which it said
it had completely destroyed the oil facility.


Ethiopia on Wednesday accused arch-foe Eritrea of supporting the
rebels who attacked the remote Chinese-run oil venture, a claim
Eritrea immediately denied.


Up to seven Chinese workers were kidnapped in Tuesday's raid on
the oil prospection facility in Ethiopia's eastern Ogaden region,
where the rebel group is fighting for the independence of ethnic
Somalis.
