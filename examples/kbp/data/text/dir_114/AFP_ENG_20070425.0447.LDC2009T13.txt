South Africa were 103-8 after 30 overs of their World Cup semi-
final against Australia at Beausejour here on Wednesday.


The winners will face Sri Lanka in Saturday's final.


Justin Kemp was on 23 with Andre Nel on nought.


South Africa captain Graeme Smith elected to bat after winning
the toss but his side were in desperate trouble as veteran Glenn
McGrath took three of the wickets to fall.


Smith was first to go bowled by Nathan Bracken for two before
McGrath took his first wicket bowling Jacques Kallis for five
while Shaun Tait had AB de Villiers caught by Adam Gilchrist for
15.


That was 26-3 which soon became 27-5 by the end of the 10th over
with McGrath having Ashwell Prince caught by Gilchrist for nought
and Mark Boucher picked up by Matthew Hayden at first slip first
ball also for nought.


Herschelle Gibbs then stopped the rot by putting on 60 for the
sixth wicket with Justin Kemp.


He hit 39 before Tait tempted him to edge the fifth ball of the
23rd over to Gilchrist.


The same Australian combination then accounted for Andrew Hall
who became the seventh man out for three to make the score 93-7
in the 27th over.


Shaun Pollock was then caught and bowled by Bradd Hogg for five
in the 30th over to take the total to 103-8.


It is the second meeting between the two teams in the ongoing
tournament, with Australia beating South Africa in a group match
at St Kitts last month.


Defending champions Australia are aiming for a World Cup hat-
trick, having won the title in 1999 in England and 2003 in South
Africa.


It is South Africa's third appearance in the Cup semi-final since
their debut in 1992.
