Three people were seriously injured on Syria's border with Iraq
as a fire broke out at a camp for Palestinian refugees from the
violence-plagued country, the UN refugee agency said on
Wednesday.


The Palestinian Red Crescent "treated three refugees for severe
burns and 25 refugees, mostly children, for smoke inhalation and
minor burns", the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said in a statement.


The cause of Tuesday's fire was unknown but strong winds caused
it to spread rapidly, burning seven tents to the ground at Al-
Tanaf refugee camp.


"This is an example of how inappropriate and dangerous this place
is for refugees to lives. It underlines the need to move these
people to an appropriate and safe place," said Laurens Jolles,
the UNHCR's representative for Syria.


The agency said at least 186 Palestinians had been confirmed
murdered in Baghdad between April 2004 and January 2007, a figure
which it fears could be much higher.


Hundreds of Palestinian families have been evicted from their
homes and the estimated 15,000 Palestinians still living in
Baghdad are considered at high risk, it said.


The UNHCR said at least 1,200 Palestinian refugees are stranded
at the Tanaf and Al-Walid camps on Syria's border with Iraq.
