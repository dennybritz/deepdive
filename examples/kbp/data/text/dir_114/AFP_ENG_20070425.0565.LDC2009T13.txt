The Gulf state of Bahrain, which provides the home base for the
US Fifth Fleet, said Wednesday that it had taken all necessary
precautions for any conflict between the United States and Iran.


Interior Minister Rashed bin Abdullah al-Khalifa told state
television that the authorities had "drawn up a plan to deal with
any threats," but added that he hoped there would be no US strike
against Iran or any new conflict in the region.


"A national committee established in May 2006 to prepare for any
catastrophes ... has already taken the necessary measures," the
minister said.


Bahrain is the second Gulf state to announce it has drawn up
contingency plans for conflict between the United States and Iran
amid the standoff over the latter's nuclear programme.


US ally Kuwait announced last week that it was forming an
emergency team to draw up its own contingency plans for any
conflict.


Washington has said that it would prefer to address its concerns
about Tehran's nuclear programme diplomatically but has refused
to rule out the option of military action.


It has beefed up its military presence in the Gulf and currently
has a second aircraft carrier there for the first time since the
2003 invasion of Iraq.
