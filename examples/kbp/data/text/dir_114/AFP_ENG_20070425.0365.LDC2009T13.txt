There is the nagging question of whether life exists other than
on Earth.


The enduring mystery of who made us -- and why.


And then there is this: Why does the foam on a pint of lager
quickly disappear but the head on a pint of Guinness linger?


Answers to questions 1 and 2 are still being sought, but the
Great Beer Riddle, at least, may soon be solved.


Writing in the prestigious British science journal Nature, an
elite scientific duo say they have devised an equation to
describe beer froth.


The breakthrough will not only settle the vexatious lager vs.
stout debate, it will also help the quest to pour a perfect pint
every time.


Beer foam is a microstructure with complex interfaces. In other
words: a cellular structure comprising networks of gas-filled
bubbles separated by liquid.


The walls of these bubbles move as a result of surface tension --
and the speed at which they move is related to the curvature of
the bubbles. As a result of this movement, the bubbles merge and
the structure "coarsens," meaning that the foam settles and
eventually disappears.


Three-dimensional equations to calculate the movement have been
made by Robert MacPherson, a mathematician at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and David Srolovitz, a
physicist at Yeshiva University, New York.


They build on work by a computer pioneer, John von Neumann, who
in 1952 devised an equation in two dimensions.


The mathematics of beer-bubble behaviour are similar to the
granular structure in metals and ceramics, so the equation also
has an outlet in metallurgy and manufacturing as well as in pubs.
