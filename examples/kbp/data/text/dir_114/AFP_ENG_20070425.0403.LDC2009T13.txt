Government forces and Tamil rebels were locked in fierce combat
in northern Sri Lanka Wednesday, a day after the guerrillas
bombed a key military base, the two sides said.


The defence ministry said that the rebel Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) shelled military positions in the Madhu area
drawing fire from security forces.


The ministry said that a total of 21 Tigers were killed and
another 28 wounded and placed its own losses at three killed and
23 wounded.


However, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) spokesman
Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said they beat back a military offensive into
territory held by them and inflicted heavy casualties on the
military.


"We have killed at least 10 government soldiers and wounded
another 50," Ilanthiriyan said by telephone from the northern
rebel-held town of Kilinochchi, further north.


The latest attack came a day after the Tigers attacked the main
Palaly military complex in the Jaffna peninsula using artillery
and their light aircraft.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
violence that began in December 2005, despite a truce arranged in
2002 to end the bloody ethnic conflict.


The Tigers have waged a 35-year campaign for independence for the
Tamil minority that has claimed more than 60,000 lives on the
Sinhalese-majority island.
