Liberia's post-war interim president facing trial on corruption
charges should not be granted immunity, prosecutors argued in
court Wednesday.


Guyde Bryant served as interim president of the western African
nation from 2003 to 2006 following peace agreements between the
government and rebels that ended 14 years of civil war.


He is accused of embezzling 1.3 million dollars (950,000 euros)
while serving as head of the transitional government.


"Bryant was not elected," prosecutor Terwon Gongloe told the
court. "He was selected. And nowhere in the accords it is
indicated that he has right to immunity."


Bryant's defense lawyers argued the country's constitution
prevents him from being prosecuted.


"Chairman Bryant served as president and played the role of a
president and so he is entitled to immunity," said lawyer
Theophilus Gould.


Following heated arguments, Supreme Court President Johnnie Lewis
suspended the hearing without setting a new date.


An audit has implicated several former top government officials
in the looting of public funds during their tenure.


When warlord-turned-president Charles Taylor was forced to step
down from power in August 2003 in a bid to end the civil war, an
interim government was installed to run the resource-rich but
poor country.


Bryant was appointed by regional peace brokers to lead the
administration and help steer the country back towards democracy.


Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected president in November 2005 and
has made fighting corruption a priority.
