The widow of Russia's first post-Soviet president Boris Yeltsin
paid a tearful tribute to her late husband Wednesday, saying he
had dedicated his life to saving Russia.


"In 1989 when he came to the congress and said that Russia needed
to be saved -- to be honest I was scared," Naina Yeltsina told
assembled guests at a Kremlin reception after her late husband's
funeral.


"But that's what happened.... He put huge amounts of energy into
saving Russia," she said in comments broadcast on the Vesti-24
television channel.


"He fulfilled his duties all his life. Work was always the most
important. Family was in second place," she said


Struggling to hold back her tears, she thanked those who had
gathered to pay tribute to him.


"I have never heard anything like this. Such were the warm, good
words they said about Boris Nikolayevich," she said, using her
husband's patronymic.
