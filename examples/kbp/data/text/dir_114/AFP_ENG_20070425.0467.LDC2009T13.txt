Lawmakers from the main opposition party in Democratic Republic
of Congo returned to parliament on Wednesday, ending a 12-day
boycott brought on by alleged government intimidation.


The Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) of failed presidential
candidate Jean- Pierre Bemba had accused President Joseph
Kabila's forces and government of intimidation, harassment and
attacks.


"The MLC lawmakers received assurances from the head of state
that he would personally seek adequate solutions to the problems
and concerns" of the opposition, said party spokesman Thomas
Luhaka.


Kabila had agreed to meet an opposition delegation on Thursday to
discuss matters, he added.


Another party, the Christian Democrats, ended a similar boycott
on Tuesday saying it had received guarantees of "freedom of
expression and safety", while a third is still mulling the issue.


The MLC headquarters were ransacked by the military after clashes
on March 22 and 23, and radio and television stations owned by
Bemba were also looted.


The clashes between the Congolese army and Bemba's guard caused
between 200 and 500 deaths, according to diplomatic sources.


Fighting broke out after Bemba, an arch-rival of Kabila, refused
to have his bodyguards integrated into the regular army.


Bemba sought refuge in the South African embassy, where he
remained until leaving for Portugal, officially for medical
treatment.


Congo's state prosecutor is seeking to have Bemba's immunity
lifted so he can face charges related to last month's violence.
