US First Lady Laura Bush on Wednesday unveiled a new plan to
provide 500,000 bed nets, which guard against mosquitoes that
spread the illness, for Zambia.


"Through the new partnership we're announcing today, mosquito
nets will be distributed to Zambia's most vulnerable households,"
Laura Bush said at the White House on the US "Malaria Awareness
Day."


Zambia, with a population of 11.5 million people, has about four
million documented cases of malaria each year, with about 50,000
fatalities from the disease. HIV/AIDS amplifies the illness's
deadly effects.


Laura Bush, who plans to travel to Zambia this summer, said that
the nets would help about one million young children, pregnant
mothers, and people infected with HIV.


"These nets will help mothers sleep soundly at night, knowing
that their babies are safe. They'll help people with HIV live
positively. And they'll give a country devastated by malaria the
promise of good health and renewed hope," she said.
