A coalition of Nigeria's civil society groups promised Wednesday
nationwide mass protests after flawed elections, calling for the
polls to be annulled.


"We are demanding that the election should be cancelled," said
Adewale Balogun, a spokesman for the 16 rights and civil society
groups at a news conference here.


He said the groups would mobilise Nigerians for mass action to
protest the results of the April 14 and 21 state, parliamentary
and presidential vote which gave landslide victory to the ruling
People's Democratic Party (PDP).


Balogun said there would be demonstrations across the country
against the poll which opposition parties, local and foreign
observers and groups have condemned as marred by large scale
irregularities, fraud and violence.


"We will have rallies. We would need to ask for civil
disobedience. We will also engage in peaceful demonstrations.
This is a struggle," he added.


"From May 1, we will need to wear black armbands to indicate we
have rejected the sham election and that we mourn the imminent
death of democracy," Balogun also said.


The meeting was convened by the 1986 Nobel prizewinner and
literary giant Wole Soyinka, who was unavoidably absent.
