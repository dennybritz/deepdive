Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said on Wednesday he could
offer no guarantees over five Iranian officials held by the
United States in Iraq, although he hoped they would be released
in the future.


"We are hopeful that they will be released in the future but I do
not have any guarantees," Zebari said at a news conference with
his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki.


US forces arrested five Iranian officials at a liaison office in
the northern Iraqi city of Arbil in January, accusing them of
being intelligence agents seeking to stir trouble in the country.


Iran insists the men are diplomats working for a "consulate" and
is furious that Washington is still holding them at an
undisclosed location in Iraq.


Zebari repeated Iraq's insistence that the men were not doing
anything illegal and said the Baghdad government was doing all it
could to ensure their release.


"They were not doing any secret work and were giving services to
the people. We are seeking their freedom at all levels of
government," he said.


Zebari said he did not want the issue to be linked to a
conference on Iraq's security at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on May
3-4 that Iran has hitherto shown a reluctance to attend.


"I do not want to connect this matter with our request for the
Islamic Republic of Iran to participate in upcoming international
meeting," said Zebari.


According to US press reports, the White House has overruled
State Department recommendations and decided the five should
remain in custody and go through a periodic six-month review.
