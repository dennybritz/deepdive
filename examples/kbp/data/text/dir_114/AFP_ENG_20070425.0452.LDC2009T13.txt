Tajikistan is planning to open its banking sector to foreign
banks, central bank president Murodali Alimardonov said on
Wednesday.


"We will give out licences to subsidiaries of foreign banks
allowing them to operate: every bank can enter our market," he
told reporters.


Under the law of the former Soviet central Asian country, foreign
banks are allowed to buy shares in local banks, but Tajikistan
has previously not given them licences for fear of them squeezing
out local banks.


The opening up is expected to take place after President Emomali
Rakhmonov gives his annual address to parliament on April 30.


Five foreign banks have already signalled their interest in
working in Tajikistan.


Economists says the Tajik banking sector is becoming stronger and
starting to win customers' confidence, especially in the case of
Tajiks working in Russia and other former Soviet countries who
send millions of dollars (euros) money home via commercial banks.
