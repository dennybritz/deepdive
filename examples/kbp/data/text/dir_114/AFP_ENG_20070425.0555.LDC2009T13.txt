Several hundred Airbus employees downed tools on Wednesday at
factories near the company's headquarters in southern France, a
union source said, in the latest sign of workforce unrest at the
European aircraft maker.


The stoppages affected two factories in Toulouse late in the day,
a representative of the CGT trade union, Xavier Petrachi, said.


The protests were sparked by a "derisory" proposal by management
that this year's profit-sharing bonus would amount to an average
5.0 euros (7.0 dollars), compared with between 1,200 and 1,800
euros last year, he said.


Airbus has been hit by several strikes and protests by French
employees since it unveiled a radical restructuring plan at the
end of February that includes 10,000 job cuts across Europe in
the next four years.


The company reported an operating loss for 2006 of 572 million
euros (752 million dollars) compared with an operating profit of
2.3 billion euros in 2005.


A European works council meeting to discuss the restructuring
plan is scheduled for Friday in Toulouse.
