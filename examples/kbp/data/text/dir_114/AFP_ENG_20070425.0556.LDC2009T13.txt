Former Haitian president Jean Bertrand Aristide, exiled in South
Africa since his 2004 ouster, received a doctorate in African
Languages Wednesday in a ceremony attended by President Thabo
Mbeki.


The 53-year-old priest, who became Haiti's first democratically-
elected leader, was among a group of several dozen awarded
doctorates in the ceremony at the University of South Africa
(UNISA) in Pretoria.


A university spokesman said that Aristide had become fluent in
Zulu since being appointed an honorary research fellow shortly
after his exile began. His wife Mildred works at the same
university.


Neither Aristide nor Mbeki made any comment to reporters who
attended the ceremony.


The populist ruler, who failed to win the approval of Haiti's
middle and upper classes during his two stints as president, also
has qualifications in theology, philosophy and psychology
obtained at universities in Haiti and Rome.


Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma told parliament last year
the government was covering the costs of the stay of Aristide,
his family, staff and entourage, which were "similar to the cost
normally incurred for a South African cabinet minister."


She said conditions such as stability and an assurance of the
former president's safety were not yet in place for him to return
to Haiti.
