UN peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo were
Wednesday conducting joint operations with the army in a restive
eastern region to clear it of Rwandan rebels, a UN source said.


The source said the joint operations were launched on Monday in
the forest of Mugaba, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of
Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu where rebels from the
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda have gained
ground.


"The clean-up operations are aimed at regaining control of the
areas occupied" by the rebels, the source said, adding that drive
would continue on Thursday.


Rwandan Hutu fighters, estimated to be about 10,000-strong by the
United Nations, are still present in eastern DR Congo where they
continue to terrorise locals.


They led 14 attacks last month in the Walungu and Kabare areas,
according to Kemal Saiki, spokesperson for the UN mission in the
DR Congo (MONUC).


Another 72 people were kidnapped and several rapes were reported.


Some of the rebels are accused of having participated in the
Rwandan genocide in 1994. Some 800,000 people, most of them
ethnic Tutsis, were killed within six weeks in Rwanda in 1994 by
members of the Hutu ethnic group.


The international community considers their presence in the DR
Congo as one of the main threats to stability in the region,
though they have been weakened in recent years by division and
desertions.
