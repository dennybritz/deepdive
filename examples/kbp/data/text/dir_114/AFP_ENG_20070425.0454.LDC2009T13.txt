A Swiss man stands to win 70,000 euros (95,000 dollars) if
Socialist Party outsider Segolene Royal wins the French
presidential elections, British bookmaker Ladbrokes said
Wednesday.


The 20,000-euro bet with odds of 7-2, placed by an unidentified
Geneva-based telephone customer, is the largest wager made with
the firm on a non-British political event, it added.


Ladbrokes has the second-round frontrunner, right-winger Nicolas
Sarkozy, as favourite to win the race to the Elysee Palace, but
the odds on him succeeding have lengthened from 1-6 to 2-7.


Sarkozy won 31.18 percent of the first round vote last Sunday.


Odds have now shortened on Royal, who attracted 25.97 percent of
the vote in the first round, to 5-2.


Ladbrokes spokesman Robin Hutchison said: "With very few
exceptions all the money has been for Sarkozy in the days after
the first round -- but the tide has definitely turned now.


"We have never laid a bet of this size on a political market
outside the British Isles and it demonstrates the huge interest
in what were once described as novelty markets," Hutchinson said.


"There will be nothing novel if we have to hand back 90,000 euros
to him when we get the official results."
