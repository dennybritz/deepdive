Republican Senator John McCain formally launched his bid for the
presidency on Wednesday, seeking to breathe life into a faltering
campaign that trails in opinion polls and fundraising.


"Today I announce my candidacy for president of the United
States," McCain told a crowd in a televised speech from
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.


He said he would seek to rebuild the US military and strengthen
the United States, saying "no nation complacent in its greatness
can long sustain it."


A former Navy pilot held captive during the Vietnam war, McCain
chose to make his announcement in New Hampshire, the same state
where he scored an upset victory primary victory in the 2000
race.


He was later defeated for the Republican nomination by George W.
Bush, now in his second term as US president.
