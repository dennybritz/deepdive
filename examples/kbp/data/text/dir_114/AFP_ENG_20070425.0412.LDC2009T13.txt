The central bank of Poland announced a quarter-point increase in
interest rates on Wednesday, the first rise in the cost of
borrowing in 13 months.


The increase puts the minimum bank intervention rate at 4.25
percent, the discount rate at 4.5 percent and the Lombard rate at
5.75 percent.


In a separate development, the national statistics board said the
country's jobless rate fell by half a percentage point in March
from February to 14.4 percent.


Out of Poland's population of 38.2 million people, 2.23 million
were unemployed in March, or 98,700 fewer than in February, the
statistics agency said.


The central bank said the decision to raise interest rates had
been driven by strong economic growth and significant wage
increases.


The economy ministry had predicted Monday that gross domestic
product would grow by seven percent in the first half of the
year.


Wages surged 9.0 percent in the past 12 months.


Inflation has also gathered pace, and was at 2.5 percent in March
on a yearly comparison, after running at 1.9 percent in February.


Last year, inflation averaged around one percent.
