US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that Iraqi Prime
Minister Nuri al-Maliki's administration "is the government we
have to work with" and deserves continued support.


Gates was asked at a news conference here whether he still
believes Maliki can bring about the political reconciliation on
which the United States has centered its strategy to stabilise
Iraq.


He said he would not have made a trip to Jordan and Egypt last
week to encourage governments in the Middle East to support
Maliki if he did not think he was up to the job.


"This government is the one we have to work with," said Gates, in
Germany as part of a European tour. "It is the democratic
government of Iraq and it deserves their support."


The United States has moved additional troops into Baghdad to
give the Maliki government time to work on healing bitter
divisions between Iraq's Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds.


But his government has so far made little headway on key elements
of the reconciliation strategy, which calls for constitutional
reforms, a de- Baathification law, an oil-revenue-sharing law and
local elections in Sunni areas.


Gates warned Iraqi leaders during a trip last week that "the
clock is ticking" and that they needed to make faster progress on
political measures.
