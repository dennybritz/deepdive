Villarreal's Robert Pires said Wednesday that he is considering
ending his career at his first club, Metz in France.


The former World Cup winner with France and Premiership champion
with Arsenal was speaking to French television channel Europe1.


He said he would consider rejoining the club he started his
career with, before moving on to Marseille and then Arsenal, at
the end of next season.


"When I left Metz (in 1998) I told Mr (Carlo) Molinari (the Metz
president) that I would re-sign for him one day," said Pires.


"I never close doors. I study every possibility. It's not certain
but I'm thinking about it. For next season it's not possible but
we'll talk again in April 2008."


Pires had said he was going to retire at 32 or 33 years of age
but now 33, he feels like continuing.


He missed the majority of this season with a knee injury, having
joined the Spanish outfit from Arsenal in the close season.
