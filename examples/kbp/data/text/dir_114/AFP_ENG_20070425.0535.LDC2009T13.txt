German international goalkeeper Jens Lehmann extended his
contract for another year with Premiership side Arsenal, he told
German daily Bild on Wednesday.


The 37-year-old's decision to stay at Arsenal until 2008 will
disappoint Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin, who had been favourites
to seal his transfer at the end of this season.


"I am going to stay an extra year," said Lehmann, who has been at
the Gunners since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2003.


"Arsenal is a great club with a good sporting outlook and I want
to play in the Champions League next season," added Lehmann, who
was sent-off early on in last season's Champions League final
which Arsenal lost to Barcelona.


The fiery goalkeeper, who previously had spells at Schalke 04 and
AC Milan, had wanted a two year extension but Arsenal coach
Arsene Wenger only offers one year extensions to players aged
over 30.
