Director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks are producing a
television miniseries focused on World War II battles in the
Pacific, the entertainment daily Variety reported.


Shooting will begin next year in Australia for the series which
will appear on the HBO cable channel in 2009.


Spielberg and Hanks previously produced the 2001 series "Band of
Brothers," which recounted the experiences of American soldiers
fighting in Europe during World War II.
