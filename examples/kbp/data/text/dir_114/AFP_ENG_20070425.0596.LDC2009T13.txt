The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average share index closed at a
record high Wednesday, smashing the 13,000-point barrier for the
first time as investors cheered upbeat profit reports.


The blue chip share gauge rocketed past the psychologically
important 13,000-point mark on the back of a flurry of fat profit
reports from the likes of Boeing and PepsiCo.


The Dow ended up a strong 135.14 points (1.04 percent) at
13,089.08 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite surged 23.35 points (0.92 percent) to
2,547.89 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index
finished up a hefty 14.80 points (1.00 percent) at a preliminary
close of 1,495.21.
