The accomplice of a bomber who killed himself and injured four
people in a Casablanca cybercafe last month testified in
Morocco's anti-terrorism court on Wednesday, a judicial source
said.


Youssef Khoudri, 17, was questioned by an examining magistrate at
the anti- terrorism court in Sale, near Rabat. Due to his young
age, Khoudri's father was present at the hearing.


Khoudri was one of the people injured when his accomplice,
Abdelfettah Raydi, blew himself up in an attack on a Casablanca
Internet cafe on March 11.


Khoudri, who did not have a criminal record prior to the attack,
fled the scene but was quickly apprehended by police, who
discovered that he too was carrying explosives.


The judicial source, who requested anonymity, also said an
examining magistrate at the Sale court had on Tuesday overseen a
meeting between five of the 31 people arrested following the
March 11 attack and Hassan Khattab, the alleged chief of Ansar Al
Mahdi.


Fifty suspected members of that alleged Islamist militant group
are currently awaiting trial in Morocco.


The judicial source said Tuesday's meeting aimed to verify
whether Khattab had financed the March 11 attack.
