A Palestinian photographer for Agence France-Presse won an Arab
award on Wednesday for a picture of the funeral of a Palestinian
child killed during an Israeli incursion in the Gaza Strip.


Mahmud Hams, 27, a native of Rafah, bagged the prize for
photography of the Arab Journalism Awards handed out by Dubai
Press Club at the end of a two-day Arab media forum in Dubai in
the United Arab Emirates.


The 15,000-dollar prize "is a boost which will prompt me to work
with more enthusiasm," said Hams, who was shot in both legs while
taking pictures in the town of Deir al-Balah in 2004.


"I am happy to be able to convey the Palestinian people's daily
reality," he said.


The winning picture, shot last year, provides a close-up of the
slain boy with part of his face still stained with blood during
the funeral, with mourners seen in the background.


It was commended by the award organisers as "a moving sight from
the Palestinians' daily tragedy."


Awards for other journalism categories were delivered during the
ceremony, including a 50,000-dollar prize for the year's Arab
media personality which went to Saudi journalist Othman al-Omair.
