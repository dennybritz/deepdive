The United States is investigating reports that China arrested
four Americans at Mount Everest base camp Wednesday after a
protest, a State Department spokesman said Wednesday.


"We have read the media reports, and are looking into them," said
Kurtis Cooper, a department spokesman.


Three protesters were held after erecting a banner that read "One
World, One Dream, Free Tibet 2008," the New York-based Students
For A Free Tibet organization said in a statement.


"One world, One Dream," is an official Beijing Olympic slogan.


Other similar banners in Chinese and Tibetan were also unfurled,
while one protester wore a shirt that said "No torch through
Tibet."


The protesters included Tenzin Dorjee, the first known exiled
Tibetan to return to the region to protest, the statement said.


The other two activists were identified as Kirsten Westby and Mac
Sutherlin, while a fourth American who was there to document the
protest, videographer Shannon Service, was also detained, the
group said.


Authorities in Tibet were not immediately available to comment.


China sent troops in to "liberate" Tibet in 1951. The Dalai Lama
later fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising and
established a government-in-exile in Dharamsala.


The protest comes a day before the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) is to approve the route for the 2008 Beijing
Olympic torch relay, which organizers hope to take to the top of
the world's highest mountain.
