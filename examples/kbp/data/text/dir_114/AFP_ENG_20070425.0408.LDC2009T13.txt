An assailant Wednesday fired three shots at security guards
outside Turkey's staunchly secularist Higher Education Board here
after he was stopped from entering the building, the NTV news
channel reported.


The man managed to escape after the attack.


He told the guards he wanted to see the board chairman, Professor
Erdogan Tezic, who has often clashed with the Islamist-rooted
government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and favours
rigid enforcement of a ban on the Islamic headscarf in Turkish
universities, NTV said.


The report did not mention any injuries.


In May last year, an Islamist militant killed a senior judge and
wounded four others when he raided Turkey's top administrative
court in what he said was in retaliation for the headscarf ban,
which the tribunal helped enforce.
