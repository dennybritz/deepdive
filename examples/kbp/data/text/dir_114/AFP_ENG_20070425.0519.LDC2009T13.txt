A Bahraini court has handed down a four-year jail term in
absentia against a Briton who charged that elements of the Sunni
elite were plotting to maintain their domination of the Shiite-
majority Gulf state, his lawyer said on Wednesday.


The sentence against Sudanese-born Salah al-Bandar, a former
government advisor later accused of spying for a foreign country
and now believed to be in London, was handed down last week,
Abdullah al-Shamlawi told AFP.


Bandar, who was employed as a "strategic security consultant" for
the government, last year compiled a 220-page report on a "secret
organisation" which he accused of aiming to rig elections and
sideline the Shiite opposition.


He said copies of the report were handed to the British, German
and US embassies. Married to a Bahraini political activist,
Bandar was expelled in September and accused of working for a
foreign intelligence service.


Last October, the high court banned the publication of any
information on the so-called Bandargate scandal. The Shiite
opposition in the Gulf state's parliament called on Wednesday for
the ban to be lifted.


Sunni-ruled Bahrain, which was shaken by a wave of Shiite unrest
in the 1990s, revived its elected parliament in 2002.


The Shiite opposition boycotted the first elections in protest at
the creation of an appointed upper house and it was only in new
polls late last year that its candidates entered parliament for
the first time.
