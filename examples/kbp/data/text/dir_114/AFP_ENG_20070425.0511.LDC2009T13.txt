game.

anymore," he said.


"I am under the impression that I have completely lost my game, I
am not in contol of events," added Gaudio, who has already
withdrawn from next week's tournament in Munich.


Gaudio, who was a highest ranked fifth in the world in April 2005
but has slipped to 69th, said he would reflect on his future
while he spends some time in Buenos Aires.


"It is possible as it is frustrating to be playing so badly,"
said Gaudio replying to a question as to whether the 6-1, 6-0
drubbing by Sweden's Robin Soderling in Barcelona could be his
last match.


"There are three important tournaments for me coming up in Rome,
Hamburg and Roland-Garros.


"Here in Buenos Aires I will be calmer and I will see what
happens."
