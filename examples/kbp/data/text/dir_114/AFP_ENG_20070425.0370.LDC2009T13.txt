UN human rights chief Louise Arbour said Wednesday she was not
going to Uzbekistan during her current tour of Central Asia as
Tashkent had snubbed her.


"When we organised this visit, we contacted all the Central Asian
countries' governments and we also asked the Uzbek government to
meet us at a certain time. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't
meet at that time," she told reporters.


Arbour is on her first trip to Central Asia where she is visiting
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan between April
25 and May 5.


Ties between the UN and Taskhent have cooled over unrest in 2005
in the country's Andijan province in which hundreds of people
were shot dead by government forces, according to rights groups
and witnesses.


Uzbek authorities however say no more than 187 people were killed
and blame Islamist insurgents for the unrest. The UN has termed
it a "massacre" and called for a an independent probe.


The 47-member UN Human Rights Council, a separate body, has
meanwhile decided to drop its examination of violations in
Uzbekistan, against the opposition of Western states such as
France, diplomatic sources in Geneva said.
