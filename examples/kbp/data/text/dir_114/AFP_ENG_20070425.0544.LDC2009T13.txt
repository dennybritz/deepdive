Werder Bremen's German international striker Miroslav Klose held
talks with out of form defending Bundesliga champions Bayern
Munich according to Thursday's edition of Bild.


The 28-year-old Polish-born marksman - leading scorer at last
year's World Cup finals - apparently met with Bayern coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld and general manager Uli Hoeness.


However, Bayern Munich refused to confirm the report with their
spokesman claiming it was mere speculation.


Nevertheless the Bavarian powerhouses have made no secret of
their admiration for Klose, who was also the leading scorer in
the 2005/06 domestic season.


"It is no secret that I have a lot of respect for Klose," said
Hitzfeld recently.


"He is an outstanding striker and he has everything in his game
to help out Bayern," added Hitzfeld, who returned to the helm
after Felix Magath was sacked in January.


While Hitzfeld's return marked a slight upturn in their fortunes
Bayern will still end the season without a trophy - they are nine
points adrift of leaders Schalke 04 - and are in danger of
missing out on the Champions League next term.


Klose, who ended a long goal drought when he scored twice earlier
this month in the second leg of their UEFA Cup quarter-final with
AZ Alkmaar, is under contract at Bremen till 2008, though, the
board has indicated they would let him go.


He has indicated his preference would be to move abroad with AC
Milan apparently interested.
