Celtic League outfit Ospreys on Wednesday  completed the capture
of Wales internationals Mike Phillips and Ian Gough.


Scrum-half Phillips signed from Cardiff Blues in a deal thought
to be worth 700,000 pounds until May 2011 while lock Gough signed
from Newport-Gwent Dragons on a contract that runs through to May
2010.


Phillips, aged 24 with 19 caps, will compete for the number nine
jersey with former All Black Justin Marshall.


The 30-year-old Gough, who has 30 caps, will be up against fellow
Wales locks Brent Cockbain, Ian Evans and Alun-Wyn Jones.


"Ian has an excellent technical game which, combined with his
physical presence, will offer a standard of performance that no
one can afford to drop under," said Ospreys coach Lyn Jones.


"With regular demands at international level throughout the
season it is important that key positions are well staffed. The
group of players we have in this boiler-house next season will be
second to none."


Jones added: "Mike and Justin have had some enthralling battles
this season and I look forward to seeing their contest for the
Ospreys number nine shirt.


"They are both highly competitive individuals, although somewhat
at differing ends of their careers, and neither will want to play
second fiddle."
