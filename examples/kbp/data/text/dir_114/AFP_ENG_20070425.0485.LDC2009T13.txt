Norway, which is to host a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO
and Russia this week, is opposed to US plans to station missile
defence bases in Eastern Europe, its foreign minister said
Wednesday.


"Norway is critical of the idea of developing such a defence"
shield, Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told public radio NRK.


"This poses questions about the kinds of threats, about the
efficiency of deterring these threats, about the possibility of
other solutions," he said, warning of the risk of "a new arms
race".


Despite Russia's staunch opposition, the United States wants to
place 10 unarmed missile interceptors in Poland and a linked
radar in the neighbouring Czech Republic by 2013.


Washington insists the network is aimed not at countering
Russia's strategic missile deterrent but rather at neutralising
the threat of ballistic missiles possibly tipped with nuclear
weapons being wielded by countries like Iran.


The subject is expected to be one of the main topics of
discussion at the NATO meeting in Oslo on Thursday and Friday.
