Canada has asked to participate as a third party in World Trade
Organization consultations on China's enforcement of intellectual
property rights, Trade Minister David Emerson said Wednesday.


The United States initiated these consultations on April 9, 2007.


"We are seeking clarification from China on its intellectual
property rights enforcement regime, given concerns expressed by
Canadian industry," said Emerson in a statement. "Our goal is to
resolve this issue through dialogue with the Chinese government
and through cooperation with our trading partners."


Canada and the United States would present their concerns to
Chinese authorities and assess the latest steps taken by China to
bring its intellectual property regime into compliance with its
WTO obligations.


If consultations do not alleviate US and Canadian concerns that
China's intellectual property regime does not comply with its WTO
obligations, a WTO panel could be requested to adjudicate the
issue, the minister said.


Canada exported 7.7 billion Canadian dollars (6.9 billion US) in
goods to China in 2006, and imported 34.5 billion dollars (31
billion US) worth of goods.


Counterfeit and pirated goods, mostly from China, are estimated
by Canadian industry to impact the Canadian economy by several
billion dollars annually.
