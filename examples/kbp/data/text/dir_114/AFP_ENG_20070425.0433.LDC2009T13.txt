English Premiership strugglers Northampton are to appeal the six-
month ban imposed on hooker Dylan Hartley for eye-gouging.


The 21-year-old New Zealand-born player, considered an outside
bet for England's World Cup squad, was found guilty of illegally
making contact with the eye of James Haskell and eye area of
Ireland international Jonny O'Connor with his hand during a
Premiership match against Wasps on April 15.


The appeal will be heard by a Rugby Football Union discipline
appeal panel on May 3 in London.


Hartley will not be selected by Northampton until the resolution
of the appeal.
