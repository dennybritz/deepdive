Protesters gathered on Hong Kong's downtown harbourside Wednesday
night to oppose the closure of a historic pier that has become a
symbol of a campaign to save the city's architectural heritage.


Conservationists carrying banners that read "do not move" and
"leave alone" called for the preservation of Queen's Pier, which
was boarded up at midnight and will be demolished.


Its closure is part of a broader redevelopment plan that will see
a huge swathe reclaimed from the famous Victoria Harbour to make
way for a congestion- relieving bypass.


The nearby Star Ferry pier was demolished last year, sparking
furious protests and scuffles between conservationists and
police.


To avoid similar disturbances, the government has said it will
consider dismantling Queen's Pier and rebuilding it nearby.


Rows over the demolition sparked renewed concern for the fate of
Hong Kong's heritage buildings, which preservationists say are
being rapidly destroyed to make way for lucrative real estate
projects.
