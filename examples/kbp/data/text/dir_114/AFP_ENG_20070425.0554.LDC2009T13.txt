Scottish international fly-half Gordon Ross signed a two year
contract with English Premiership side Saracens on Wednesday from
French outfit Castres.


The 28-year-old had only been at Castres since the beginning of
this season having had spells at Edinburgh and then four terms
with Leeds Tykes.


Ross has been capped 18 times but found it hard to get a regular
starting slot, first losing out to Gregor Townsend and then out
of favour with the present national coach Frank Hadden, who
prefers Dan Parks.
