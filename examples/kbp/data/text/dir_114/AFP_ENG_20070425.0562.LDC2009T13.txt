Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said Wednesday that early
parliamentary elections would be held on June 24, a month later
than the date he set in a decree that sparked a political crisis
here.


"In order to hold elections as soon as possible and find a
democratic, political resolution to the problems in Ukraine... I
am signing an order to hold early elections for Ukraine's
parliament on June 24," Yushchenko said in a televised address.


The Western-leaning president on April 2 called for early
elections, sparking a paralysing feud with arch-rival Prime
Minister Viktor Yanukovych.


He accused the pro-Russian ruling coalition led by Yanukovych to
have been illegally poaching deputies in parliament.


Yanukovych's coalition can currently muster about 250 votes in
the legislature, 50 short of a threshold of 300 needed to make
changes to the constitution and possibly oust Yushchenko.
