Iran has still not decided whether to attend a conference on
Iraq's security in Egypt next month and will announce its
position in the next days, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki
said Wednesday after talks with his Iraqi counterpart Hoshyar
Zebari.


"No decision has been taken and we will inform you in the coming
days whether we will participate or whether we will not
participate," Mottaki told a joint news conference with Zebari.


Iran has until now shown reluctance to commit to the May 3-4
conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, which will also include its arch
foe the United States, saying it was waiting for Zebari's visit
before announcing a decision.
