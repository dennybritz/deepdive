Israel's public watchdog recommended on Wednesday that a criminal
investigation be opened into Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in
connection with corruption allegations, public radio reported.


State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss accused Olmert, while trade
and industry minister, of trying to advance a former business
partner's interests by giving him state funds to help set up a
factory, the radio said.
