The UN's African development director said Wednesday the
continent would fail to reach the goal of slashing poverty in
half by 2015 as it was beset by a legion of structural problems.


"Despite some encouraging economic results, Africa will not
achieve the millennium development goals by 2015," Gilbert
Houngbo from the United Nations' development programme said in
the Congolese capital Brazzaville.


"African growth is handicapped by structural weaknesses. These
handicaps include poor empowerment of women, weak child
protection, insufficient access to reproductive health and to
decent work," he said.


Houngbo, who called on African nations to practise good
governance and promote social cohesion, was speaking at the
opening of the annual meeting of UN development representatives
from sub-Saharan Africa.
