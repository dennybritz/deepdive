Romania on Wednesday started pulling out its 100-strong battalion
from the main southern Iraqi city of Basra after announcing that
the force had "accomplished its mission."


Eighty-nine soldiers returned home early Wednesday and the
remaining 11 will be repatriated next week, the defence ministry
said.


Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said Monday he was considering
proposing the withdrawal of all 603 Romanian troops from Iraq by
the end of the year.


Romanian president Traian Basescu, suspended for allegedly
violating the constitution, has been a strong advocate of keeping
Romanian troops in Iraq for as long as the Iraqi government needs
them.


He said last month that the battalion in Basra had "accomplished
its mission," while announcing their pull-out.


More than 400 Romanian soldiers are tasked with monitoring
checkpoints and oil facilities while the ones in Basra were
charged with protecting UN personnel.
