Levski Sofia boss Stanimir Stoilov has been installed as the
interim coach of the Bulgarian national team, the country's
federation said Wednesday.


Stoilov was appointed just two weeks after former Barcelona star
Hristo Stoichkov quit as national team boss amid growing
criticism. He has since joined Celta Vigo in Spain.


Bulgaria are currently third in their Euro 2008 qualifying group,
trailing leaders the Netherlands by five points and two behind
second-placed Romania, with only the top two teams qualifying for
the finals in Austria and Switzerland.


Dimitar Penev, the coach who guided Bulgaria to the World Cup
semi-finals in the United States in 1994, has been named as the
team's technical director.
