A Polish proposal to ban discussion of homosexuality in schools
would violate European law, the European commissioner for equal
opportunity said Wednesday.


"Such a law, if it were to emerge, would be in contradiction with
the European human rights convention and the EU charter on
fundamental rights," Vladimir Spidla told the European Parliament
as part of a debate on homophobia.


Several Polish parliament members walked out after a vote to
suspend the debate failed.


Poland's deputy education minister, Miroslaw Orzechowski, said
last month that legislation was being prepared that would lead to
the dismissal of teachers who promoted "homosexual attitudes."


It would also prohibit gay organisations from providing
information in schools on protection from sexually transmitted
diseases, the deputy minister said.


Spidla said it appeared the proposed Polish legislation had not
yet been formulated.


The organisation Human Rights Watch has also criticised the
proposal as a violation of basic rights.
