The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday that it would
inaugurate a new Youth Olympics for 14 to 18-year-old athletes
from 2010.


"Such an event will serve to encourage 14-18 year olds to engage
more in sport," the IOC said in a statement released during its
executive board meeting here this week.


IOC president Jacques Rogge told a press conference that the
summer and winter Youth Games would last between seven and 10
days in contrast to the longer open- age Olympic Games.


He said around 1,000 athletes would compete in the winter Games
and up to 3,000 in the summer edition.


The inaugural summer Games would be in 2010 followed by a winter
Games two years later. No host cities had yet been decided, he
said.
