Francois Bayrou, the defeated centrist whose 6.8 million voters
are key to France's presidential race, Wednesday refused to
endorse either socialist Segolene Royal or right winger Nicolas
Sarkozy in the May 6 run-off.


"I will give no instructions for the vote. I consider that the
French people who voted for me are citizens free to make their
own choice," said Bayrou.


Bayrou, whose credibility was boosted by his performance in
Sunday's first round, announced the creation of a new political
party, the Democrat Party, to contest legislative elections in
June.
