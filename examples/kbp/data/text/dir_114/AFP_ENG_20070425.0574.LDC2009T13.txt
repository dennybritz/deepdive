Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas tried to dampen down speculation
linking him with a bid for Portugal winger Ricardo Quaresma on
Wednesday, describing the rumours as premature.


Aulas also denied he was lining up a bid for Lille midfield
enforcer Jean II Makoun and poured scorn on suggestions that
Portuguese midfielder Tiago could be on his way out of the club.


Speaking to Europe1 television channel, Aulas admitted France
left-back Eric Abidal could be leaving in the close season, with
rumours suggesting Barcelona is his likely destination.


However, Aulas said there had been no contact from the Catalans.
