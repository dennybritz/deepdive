Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said Wednesday that early
parliamentary elections would be held on June 24, a month later
than the date he set in a decree that sparked a political crisis
here.


"In order to hold elections as soon as possible and find a
democratic, political resolution to the problems in Ukraine... I
am signing an order to hold early elections for Ukraine's
parliament on June 24," Yushchenko said in a televised address.
