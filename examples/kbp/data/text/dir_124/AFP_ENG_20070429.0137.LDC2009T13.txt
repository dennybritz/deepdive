Scores of thousands rallied here Sunday in defence of Turkey's
secular system amid a dispute between the army and the Islamist-
rooted government over presidential elections.


"Turkey is secular and will stay that way," chanted the
protestors, who carried Turkish flags and portraits of the
founder of modern Turkey Mustafa Mekal Ataturk.
