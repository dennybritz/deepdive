Spain's Princess Letizia, wife to heir to the throne Prince
Felipe de Bourbon, was admitted to a Madrid hospital Sunday where
she is due to give birth to her second daughter, a royal
spokesman told AFP.


Letizia, 34, and Felipe who married in in 2004 are parents of a
one-year-old daughter, Leonor, and are expecting their second
girl in May.


She was admitted to the luxury private Ruber Internacional clinic
in northern Madrid, where she gave birth to her first child.
