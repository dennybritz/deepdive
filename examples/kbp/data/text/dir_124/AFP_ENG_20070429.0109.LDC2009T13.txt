Nigeria on Sunday began preparations for the inauguration of a
new government despite widespread protests and criticisms over
the conduct of general elections earlier this month.


A 29-member organising committee was approved by outgoing
President Olusegun Obasanjo, who steps down on May 29 after eight
years in office and will hand over to his annointed successor,
Umar Musa Yar'Adua.


The ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) won a landslide
victory in both the governorship and parliamentary polls this
month.


But both votes were marred by violence, resulting in about 200
deaths, and were heavily criticised by the United States and
European Union as the worst in the African nation's recent
history.


Local and international monitors also said the vote was generally
flawed.


Opposition parties and civil society groups have called for the
cancellation of the vote and threatened to refuse to recognise a
government formed from it. They have organised peaceful protests
for Tuesday.


Elections in some districts were rerun on Saturday but were
marred by voter apathy.
