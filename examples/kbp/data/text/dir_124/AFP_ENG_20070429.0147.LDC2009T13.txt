Brazilian midfielder Ponte fired home the sole goal to give
defending champions Urawa Red Diamonds a 1-0 win over Kashima
Antlers in J-League football on Sunday.


Ponte scored in the 56th minute off a Nobuhisa Yamada pass.


"It's really tough to play an away game. According to my
experiences, it's especially difficult to beat Kashima at their
home. We won three points from the win. I'm really happy about
it," said Urawa's German coach Holger Osieck.


"Personally I'm happy that there's harmony between the defenders,
midfielders and forwards as a one team. Each player showed his
skills. Everybody did his job for each other."


Meanwhile, Kashima's Brazilian coach Oswaldo Oliveira said Urawa
controlled the match after scoring.


"It was a game whether or not you can take the first chance and
the last chance. If we could have scored the first goal, we would
have controlled the game."


"Mentally my players lacked accuracy when we had to take the
chance, but my players didn't play bad, they started to play
better and better. We just need a bit of adjustment," he added.


Urawa now have five wins and two draws against one defeat for 17
points, two points behind leaders Gamba Osaka and one point above
Kashiwa Reysol. Kawasaki Frontale, Nagoya Grampus Eight and
Jubilo Iwata trail them with 15 points each.


In the only other game on Sunday, Kawasaki were held to a 1-1
draw by JEF United Chiba with Chong Tese and Koki Mizuno
exchanging goals in the 66th and 81st minutes.


On Saturday, Osaka thrashed Oita Trinita 4-0, while Kashiwa
defeated Nagoya 2-0 and Iwata beat Hiroshima 4-2.
