Unidentified gunmen shot dead a Tamil journalist in Sri Lanka's
embattled northern peninsula of Jaffna Sunday, his colleagues
said.


Selvaraja Rajeewarnam, 24, of the Tamil language Uthayan
newspaper, was shot dead as he rode a cycle near an army check
point, which is also close to an office of the International Red
Cross, the rights group Free Media Movement said.


"The FMM condemns this murder and sees it as yet another instance
that clearly demonstrates the culture of violence, intolerance
and intimidation that exists in Sri Lanka at present," the group
said in a statement.


It noted that six media workers, including journalists, have been
killed in Jaffna over the past year.


No active investigations have brought the culprits to justice,
the FMM said.


"A culture of impunity vitiates free media across Sri Lanka and
this murder is evidence that human security for journalists
continues to deteriorate."


Media organisations have described Sri Lanka as the most
dangerous place on earth for journalists after Iraq, and rights
groups say that critics of government policy are treated as
traitors and enemies of the state.


Although there is no formal censorship imposed, Sri Lankan
authorities prevent journalists from travelling to areas held by
rebels, who are waging a separatist conflict that has killed more
than 60,000 people since 1972.
