Algeria plans to raise annual gas exports by a third to 83
billion cubic metres of gas from 2010, Energy Minister Chakib
Khelil said Sunday.


"We foresee exporting 85 billion cubic metres of gas yearly in
2010, which will be a 30 percent increase from the current
level," he said.


Half of the exports would comprise of liquefied natural gas, the
minister said.


Khelil said two liquefied natural gas projects, each with a
capacity of 4.5 million tonnes, would be up and running between
2011 and 2012.


He said both projects were being bankrolled by Algeria's national
oil company Sonatrac which cut its debt by 500 million dollars in
2006 and notched up annual revenues of 54 billion dollars.
