Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, the presidential candidate
of the Islamist-rooted government, said Sunday that he would not
withdraw from the race despite the army's threat of action to
protect the secular regime.


"It is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any
way," Gul told reporters here in televised remarks.


Gul said his bid for the presidency was "not a decision that was
taken in a night" but the result of lengthy negotiations.
