UEFA Cup chasing Hearts dented Celtic's hopes of brandishing
their Scottish Premier League trophy with pride after stunning
the champions 3-1 at Parkhead on Sunday.


Celtic dominated an eventless first half but it was Hearts who
broke the deadlock when Kestutis Ivaskevicius poked the ball past
Artur Boruc in the 57th minute.


A curling free kick from Andrew Driver doubled the visitors' lead
barely four minutes later, and then former Tynecastle defender
Steven Pressley headed home to reduce the arrears for Celtic just
after the hour mark.


Hearts' 16th win of the season was virtually assured when
Pressley brought down Ghanaian international Laryea Kingston in
the penalty area and Michal Pospisil stepped up to beat Boruc
from the spot to make it 3-1.


The result was Celtic's fourth defeat of the season, but will
prove a blip on a championship campaign which they wrapped up
last week when Japanese midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura struck a
late winner away at Kilmarnock.


It is a lot more valuable to fourth-placed Hearts, who can now
hope to push Aberdeen, in third, all the way in the race for a
place in next season's UEFA Cup.


Aberdeen have a four-point lead over Hearts, with Hibernian in
fifth at 11 points adrift of their Edinburgh rivals.
