Team New Zealand have expressed disappointment at their
performance in the first stage of qualifying for the America's
Cup.


The Kiwis, out to atone for the 5-0 whitewash by Switzerland's
Alinghi in the 2003 America's Cup, finished the first round robin
stage of the Louis Vuitton Cup in third.


With three losses NZL 92 ended the 11-race programme on 18 points
behind leaders BMW Oracle on 21 points and Italy's Luna Rossa
(19).


And manager Grant Dalton said: "We're glad to put it behind us.


"We're not happy with being third. We were looking for a better
performance. We can't wait to get into round robin 2. We will
have to do better."


Reflecting on Saturday's loss to Oracle which was balanced by a
win over Sweden's Victory Challenge Dalton shrugged: We didn't
sail well enough. It was as simple as that. We will need to do
better."
