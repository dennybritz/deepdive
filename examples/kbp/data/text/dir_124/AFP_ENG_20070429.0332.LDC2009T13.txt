Voting ended peacefully on Sunday in Mali's presidential
elections that are expected to give incumbent President Amadou
Amani Toure a second mandate.


Polling stations closed around 6:00 pm (1800 GMT) across the west
African state, the world's third poorest country.


Electoral agents, party representatives and officials from the
constitutional court and the electoral commission immediately
started collating and counting the votes.


First results are expected on Monday but full results should be
ready around Wednesday or Thursday, given the huge size of the
country that lies on the edge of the Sahara desert.


From the around 30 polling stations visited by AFP correspondents
in and around the capital, turnout appeared slightly better than
the 25 percent rate recorded in the last two votes in 1997 and
2002.


"The general impression is that voter abstention was slightly
less this year than in preceding two rounds," said Gerard
Latortue, Haiti's former Prime Minister who is heading the OIF
organisation of French speaking countries team of observers, told
AFP.


Until shortly before the polling closed, no incident was
reported.


Amadou Toumani Toure, who won praise for restoring civilian rule
after he led a military takeover in the early 1990s, is seeking a
new term as an independent candidate.
