Hundreds of metallurgy, automobile and electrotechnics workers
Sunday began a series of strikes and go-slow actions across
Germany to press for higher wages, the main metalworkers' union
said.


Several hundred employees of tinplate manufacturer Rasselstein
gathered at a factory in the southwestern town of Andernach to
demand a 6.5 percent pay hike, IG Metall, Germany's dominant
metalworkers' union, said.


About 200 workers at a car parts unit run by German giant Bosch
and a unit of commercial vehicle manufacturer MAN also briefly
lay down their tools, it said, adding that about 150 employees of
bulb manufacturer Osram also staged an hour- long strike in
Berlin.


IG Metall vice president Berthold Huber has warned of "massive
and vast" strikes if the workers' demands are not met.


"IG Metall is ready for war," he said. "We need pay hikes that
are significant, steady and durable."


The union is demanding a 6.5 percent salary increase for 3.4
million workers while management groups are broadly offering a
2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus hike.
