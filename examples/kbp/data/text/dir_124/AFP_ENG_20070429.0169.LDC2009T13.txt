More than one million people rallied here Sunday in support of
Turkish secularism and democracy amid a political crisis over
presidential elections, police sources said.


Police officers at the scene of the mass demonstration in the
European side of Istanbul told AFP that the crowd had swelled
beyond a million people.


The rally at the city's sprawling Caglayan square was supported
by some 600 non- governmental organizations and follows a similar
demonstration in Ankara on April 14 which drew up to 1.5 million
people, according to some estimates.
