Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said Sunday that
developing nations should strive for good governance and invest
in their citizens to free them from poverty and violence.


"There is already an abundance of empirical evidence that no
matter what your political system is, unless you enforce good
governance you will not achieve progress," he said at an
international conference in Indonesia.


"Many democracies failed due to poor governance and
mismanagement," the president said.


Developing countries should aim for accountability and invest in
their people through high quality education and health care, he
said.


They could free their citizens from the "bondage of poverty and
conflict" by nurturing their creativity, Yudhoyono added.


The president's speech opened the Inter-Parliamentary Union
conference, a meeting comprising 128 countries.


Yudhoyono said rich and poor countries had to work in partnership
on issues such as trade and debt relief.


Wealthy nations could do more to open up their markets to goods
from the developing world, especially agricultural products, and
to ease the debt burden on poorer countries, he said.


"The developed world can help developing countries that are
strangled by chronic debts through innovative debt relief
programmes.


"Developed countries can increase financial flows, especially
foreign direct investment, to the developing world," he said.


They could also share technology and expertise, he added.


Developing countries should work hard to provide an attractive
environment for foreign direct investment, the president said,
since overseas investors need to feel secure about the money the
commit.
