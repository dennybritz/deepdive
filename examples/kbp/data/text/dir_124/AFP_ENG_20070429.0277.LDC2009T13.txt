South Africa's Charl Schwartzel captured his second European
title when he won the Spanish Open on Sunday.


Schwartzel finished on a 16-under-par total of 272 to take the
450,000 dollars first prize, a 15-foot eagle putt on the long
16th proving decisive for the 22 -year-old from Johannesburg.


He finished one shot ahead of Indian Jyoti Randhawa, who carded a
final round of 67 to finish on a total of 273.
