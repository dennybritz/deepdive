President Amadou Toumani Toure, the favourite to win Mali's
elections on Sunday, has expressed his hope that voting passes
freely in keeping with the country's democratic track record.


"My wish is that the elections go well, that Malians vote
peacefully and freely," he said shortly after casting his ballot
in the polls in which he is bidding for a second five-year term.


The former military general ousted dictator Moussa Traore in 1991
and installed a multi-party system before handing over power to
civilians in 1992. Ten years later he stood for presidential
elections and won.


Toure, 58, does not have a political party and is standing this
time as an independent. But he enjoys the backing of two large
coalitions and a myriad of smaller political parties, including
the Tuareg ex-rebels.


He is facing seven other aspirants, the most credible being key
opposition figure Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, a former prime minister
and head of the national assembly.


Toure refused to speculate on the possibility of a run-off if no
candidate garners the 50 percent of votes needed to win on
Sunday.


"I do not know if there will be a second round," he told
journalists in the capital Bamako.


Observers fear the election could be marked by voter apathy after
fewer than two-thirds of the approximately 6.8 million potential
voters bothered to collect their polling identification cards.


In the last elections in 2002 and 1997, voter turnout in the
former French colony fell under 25 percent.
