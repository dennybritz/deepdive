Russia's nine-time champions Spartak Moscow missed a chance to
stay alone on top of domestic league's table as they failed to
win at Krasnodar on Sunday, recording a 0-0 draw.


Spartak and FC Moscow still share the lead in the Russian Premier
League, both on 15 points from seven matches, one point ahead of
defending champions CSKA and Saint Petersburg, who share the
third spot.


Reigning champions CSKA clinched a 3-1 win against visitors
Ramenskoye.


The Red Army side were in command from the start and their full
back Vasily Berezutsky put them 1-0 up in the 21st minute,
scoring past helpless Ramenskoye 'keeper Antonin Kinsky after a
mix-up in defence.


Two minutes later CSKA winger Yury Zhirkov added a second, firing
home from inside the box after a well-served corner.


Ramenskoye striker Igor Lebedenko reduced the arrears in the 30th
minute firing home from the edge of the penalty box.


After the interval both teams created a set of scoring chances
but missed them all before the 82nd minute, when CSKA's Brazilian
forward Vagner Love netted his side's third to secure their well-
deserved win.


FC Moscow had Argentinian striker Hector Bracamonte to thank for
opening the scoring after 13 minutes in the match against
Lokomotiv Moscow.


But the railway-backed side's Serbian defender Branislav Ivanovic
levelled with 17 minutes to play, handing Spartak a chance to top
the league's table, which they later missed.
