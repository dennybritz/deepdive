A 4.6 magnitude earthquake Sunday jolted a remote southwestern
Pakistani coastal town panicking residents, but officials said
there were no casualties.


The quake occurred at 11:35 am (0635 GMT) and it's epicentre was
located some 730 kilometres (453 miles) southwest of
Baluchistan's provincial capital of Quetta, a seismological
department official said.


Local residents rushed out of homes, shops and cafes in panic
after feeling tremors in the Arabian Sea coastal town of Gwadar,
witnesses said.


A part of a hill overlooking the newly-built deep-sea Gwadar port
slid away during the jolts, but there were no casualties or
damage to any buildings, they said.


Local government officials and rescue services confirmed there
were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
