Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and his Afghan counterpart
Hamid Karzai arrived here on Sunday for talks on tackling the
Taliban-led insurgency, news agency Anatolia reported.


The two men were due to attend a dinner later on Sunday hosted by
Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer followed by a formal round
of talks on Monday.


The summit is meant to ease tensions between the two leaders amid
mutual allegations over the growing extremist violence on both
sides of their shared 2,400 kilometre (1,500-mile) border.


The Taliban movement was toppled from government in Afghanistan
more than five years ago but is waging an insurgency that is
supported by other Islamic extremists.


Karzai has been joined by some Western figures in accusing
Islamabad of not doing enough to round up Taliban and Al-Qaeda
leaders living in Pakistan and crack down on extremist groups
training and funding militants.


Islamabad meanwhile says it has taken effective measures and
accuses Afghanistan of shifting the blame onto Pakistan for its
own failures.
