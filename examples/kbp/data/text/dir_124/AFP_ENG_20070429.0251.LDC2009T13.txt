Birmingham City and Sunderland won automatic promotion to the
Premiership on Sunday after their only other rivals for one of
the two spots Derby County lost 2-0 to Crystal Palace.


Both were relegated last term but after a shaky start to both
their campaigns regained form.


Sunderland's success has come under the inspirational guidance of
former Ireland and Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane, whose
appointment by compatriot Niall Quinn raised some eyebrows at the
time but has proved a masterstroke.


Keane will now have the opportunity to cross swords with his
former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson next season.


The third and final spot in the Premiership will be decided in
the play-offs with Derby having the consolation of being assured
of one of the four teams to take part in those.


The other three places will be decided next weekend in the final
round of matches with West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton,
Southampton, Stoke and Preston North End all vying to join Derby
in the play-offs.
