AC Milan's tigerish midfielder Gennaro Gattuso will be fit for
next Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, second leg at home
to Manchester United after recovering from a right foot injury.


The 29-year-old Italian World Cup winner suffered the injury in
last Tuesday's 3-2 first leg defeat at the hands of the English
Premiership leaders.


While Gattuso was given the all-clear, AC Milan captain Paolo
Maldini, who aggravated a left knee injury at Old Trafford,
remains a doubt for the six-time European champions.


"Gattuso will definitely be there, but we will have to see about
Maldini," AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said after his side's
1-0 Serie A win at Torino on Saturday.
