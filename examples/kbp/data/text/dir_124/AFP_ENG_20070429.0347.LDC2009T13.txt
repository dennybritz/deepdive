A Yemeni MP whose family has been leading a deadly three-year-old
uprising among the Zaidi minority warned Sunday that force would
not end the revolt, in an interview with Al-Jazeera channel.


"The government always promotes a military solution, and we have
said that the military choice cannot solve the issue," Yahia
Badreddin al-Huthi told the Qatar-based news channel from his
base in Germany.


"Not even if it lasts 400 years or 500 years of fighting and
jihad (holy war)," added Huthi, whose Shiite-offshoot community
is caught in fierce fighting with security forces in Yemen's
northern mountains.


Hundreds of people have died since the rebellion erupted in 2004
-- including Huthi's brother Hussein who led the rebels.


"(Fighting will continue) until there is freedom and dignity, or
death in a dignified way," Huthi said.


He strongly rejected claims by the Yemeni government that the
rebels were receiving aid from abroad.


"Had we had an external support, our fighters would have reached
by now the gates of Sanaa," he said.


Yemen's new Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Mujawar charged in an
interview with AFP this month that Libya and "possibly" Iran have
helped the Zaidi rebels.


He added that force was the only way to end the uprising.


The rebels reject as illegitimate the current republican regime
which seized power in a 1962 coup, overthrowing a Zaidi imamate.
