Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld slammed his side on Sunday
and revealed he will banish players to the reserves after their
2-1 defeat at home to Hamburg all but closed the door on a
Champions League berth.


The Bayern boss insists if he was forced to pick players on form
alone, he would not have the necessary 11 players needed to field
a team.


Their tenth defeat of the season leaves Bayern well off the pace
in their quest for a top-three spot with three games left and
means they are set to miss out on the Champions League for the
first time in 11 years.


"In 23 years, I have never seen aything like it," said the 58
-year-old, who has won the Champions League with both Borussia
Dortmund and Bayern.


"If I had to select players on current form, I would not have
enough to make a team.


"I am going to think about dropping one or two players to the
reserves."


Senior figures at the German giants are also beginning to voice
their discontent.


General manager Uli Hoeness said there will be "sweeping changes
next season" after the Hamburg defeat, while captain and
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn refused to comment "for fear of being
suspended (if he) really said what he thought".
