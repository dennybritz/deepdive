The UN's World Food Programme launched a new appeal on the
weekend for donations for the "emergency situation" in Chad,
where the monsoon season is about to strike.


The WFP's executive director, Josette Sheeran, said during a
visit to N'Djamena that more support was needed for the country
because of a surge in the number of internally displaced people
and refugees pouring in from the neighbouring Sudanese region of
Darfur.


"In Chad, one among five children dies from hunger and
malnutrition by the time they are five years old. So we have a
chronic malnutrition problem, a chronic hunger problem," she
said.


"Right now, we are preparing for the rains to come and we have to
preposition five months of food in the eastern Chad region.
That's a lot of food that needs to get in. So in fact we are
putting out an appeal to get additional help here."


Four years of ethnic strife in Darfur have resulted in at least
200,000 deaths and displaced more than two million people,
according to UN figures. The conflict has since spread to Chad,
compounding that country's problems.
