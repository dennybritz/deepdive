Spain's Princess Letizia, wife to heir to the throne Prince
Felipe de Bourbon, gave birth on Sunday to their second daughter,
the palace said.


The birth occurred shortly before 1530 GMT at the luxury private
Ruber Internacional clinic in northern Madrid, where she gave
birth to her first child in October 2005.


The infant will be third in line to the throne, which is
currently occupied by King Juan Carlos, behind her father and
sister.


Letizia, 34, and Felipe, 39, were married in 2004.


Numerous photographers and journalists staked out positions in
front of the clinic Sunday after the princess arrived there in
the afternoon. The child had originally been due in early May.
