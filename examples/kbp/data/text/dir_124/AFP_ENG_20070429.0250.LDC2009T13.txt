The Czech Republic will not bow to foreign pressure in deciding
whether to install a tracking radar as part of a disputed anti-
missile system the United States wants to deploy in eastern
Europe, the prime minister said Sunday.


"The Czech Republic will decide on this either through parliament
or through a referendum involving its people, and not someone in
Brussels or Moscow," Mirek Topolanek was quoted as saying by the
local CTK news agency.


The US plan to station 10 interceptors in Poland and a tracking
radar in the Czech Republic is being vehemently opposed by
Russia.


Washington announced in January its hope to extend the so-far
unproven missile defence shield to cover European allies, with
the network due to become operational by 2013.


Russia fears the system could target its missile arsenal and
start a new arms race. It disagrees with Washington's assessment
that Iran could obtain weapons within a decade that would have
the range to strike at Europe.


Opinion polls indicate most Poles and Czechs oppose the plan and
some NATO allies also express reservations, although US officials
say these have largely been addressed in a series of meetings
with top US officials in recent weeks.


Henry Obering, who oversees the Pentagon's Missile Defense
Agency, evoked the "increasing threat of Iranian missiles" during
a visit to Prague last Monday.
