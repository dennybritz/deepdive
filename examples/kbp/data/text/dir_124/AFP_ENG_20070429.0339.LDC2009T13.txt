Four speleologists died Sunday during a research of a cave in
central Serbia, Beta news agency reported.


The bodies of the four were found some 1,200 meters (yards)
inside the Ravanica cave near the town of Cuprija, some 140
kilometers (85 miles) south of Belgrade, Mirjana Vrzina, the
magistrate conducting the probe, said.


Rescuers who pulled out the bodies said the cause of the death
most likely was carbon monoxide released by a pump extracting
water from a lake in the cave.


The four, all from Belgrade, had come along with five other
speleologists to research the cave, the report said.
