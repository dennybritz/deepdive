Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki will attend an
international conference in Egypt on Iraq's security, an official
from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's office confirmed on Sunday.


The official, who declined to be named, said Iraqi Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki telephoned Ahmadinejad earlier in the day and
asked him to agree that Iran take part in the conference.


"Ahmadinejad, taking into account Iran's support of the
popularly-elected government of Iraq, said that Iran will take
part at the level of foreign minister," the official said.


Meanwhile, state television reported that Iran's top national
security official Ali Larijani had arrived in Baghdad on Sunday
afternoon for a three-day visit for talks on the May 3-4
conference in Sharm el-Sheikh.
