Canadian playwright Robert Lepage, known for work including "The
Dragons' Trilogy," was on Sunday awarded the Europe Theatre
Prize.


Lepage was supposed to share the award with German director Peter
Zadek, but the latter was not able to attend the ceremony in
Salonika in the north of Greece because of theatre commitments in
Berlin, organisers said.


The prize carries an award of 60,000 euros (82,000 dollars).


Lepage, 49, had his first success more than 20 years ago in his
native Quebec with his piece "Circulations". His acclaim spread a
year later with "The Dragons' Trilogy".


He founded his own theatre company, Ex Machina, in 1994. His film
work includes "The Confessional" and "The Far Side of the Moon".


The European Commission created the prize in 1986. Previous
winners include Ariane Mnouchkine, Peter Brook, Giogio Strehler
and Robert Wilson.
