One of Italy's most senior and controversial Roman Catholic
priests, archbishop Angelo Bagnasco of Genoa, received a bullet
and his photograph stamped with a swastika in the mail, a
newspaper reported Sunday.


Bagnasco, who is also president of the Italian Episcopal
Conference, received a "small bullet and his photograph stamped
with a swastika" in a letter sent to his office last week, the Il
Corriere Mercantile daily reported.


The 64-year-old prelate has over the past few weeks received hate
messages expressed in critical letters and unflattering graffiti
over his opposition to same-sex unions.


Bagnasco, in line with the Catholic Church, is opposed to Italian
government proposals to recognise civil partnerships between
unmarried couples, both heterosexual and homosexual.


He has maintained that a family can only be founded on a marriage
between a man and a woman and has appeared to compare same sex
partnerships to incest or paedophilila.


A spokesman for the archbishop's office told the ANSA new agency
that the message had probably been sent by a "small fringe group
of extremists."
