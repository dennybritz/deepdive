Israel has approved in principle the purchase of Palestinian gas
from British Gas, the company developing a field off the Gaza
Strip, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office told AFP on Sunday.


"The government on Sunday decided to cooperate with British Gas,"
an official at Olmert's office said, without elaborating.


"If such a contract is finalised, it can bring the Palestinian
Authority dividends worth tens of millions of dollars per year,"
army radio said after the weekly cabinet meeting when the
decision was taken.


The government approved the move despite objections from several
ministers, including hardline Strategic Affairs Minister Avigdor
Lieberman of the ultra- nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, the
radio said.


The gas will come from the "Gaza Maritime" fields discovered off
the coast of the troubled coastal strip in 1999-2000, and which
are thought to hold reserves of 40 billion cubic metres.


British Gas clinched a 20-year concession on the fields in
partnership with Consolidated Contractors Co (CCC), a firm owned
by the powerful Palestinian Khury and Sabbagh families.


The British energy giant and Israel have engaged in nearly six
years of talks over the possible purchase of Palestinian gas.


Last May, British Gas abruptly broke off negotiations, saying
Israel was not ready to pay the market price.


But negotiations resumed a month later after Olmert visited
London and discussed the issue with finance minister Gordon
Brown.
