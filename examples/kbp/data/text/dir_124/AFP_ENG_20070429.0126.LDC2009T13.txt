Suspected militants shot dead two Pakistani men accused of spying
for US troops in neighbouring Afghanistan, police said Sunday.


The bodies of two men, aged about 30, were found early Sunday by
paramilitary soldiers near Khirgi checkpost in the northwestern
town of Jandola which borders the South Waziristan tribal
district, local police official Omar Hayat said.


A note found with the bodies read: "They were spying for
Americans. They were involved in fake currency business and were
enemies of 160 million (Pakistani) people."


The pair were shot in the head and one also had knife cuts on his
throat, Hayat said.


"We have identified the dead men and informed their families and
the bodies were kept at the main police station in the adjoining
town of Tank," he said.


Several tribesmen have been shot dead or beheaded this year for
allegedly spying for US-led forces in Afghanistan or supporting
Pakistan's campaign against Al- Qaeda and other militants in the
rugged area.


Key US ally Pakistan has deployed some 80,000 troops to hunt down
Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters who are believed to have sneaked
into the tribal terrain after the fall of the Taliban regime in
Afghanistan in late 2001.
