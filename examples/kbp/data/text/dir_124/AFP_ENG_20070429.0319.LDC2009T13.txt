Twenty-three people including half a dozen children were injured
Sunday after a merry-go-round malfunctioned at a small amusement
park in northern France, the emergency service said.


"They suffered light injuries but we were worried about two of
them and they have been flown out by helicopter to Lille," the
nearest big city, Christian Erb, a doctor with the national
emergency services SAMU told AFP.


Erb said the two were found to be in better shape than thought
earlier.


The accident occurred at a park outside the town of Saint Omer.
The ages of the injured ranged from four to 58.


A technical glitch caused the seats on the merry-go-round, which
went up and down while revolving, to plummet six metres (nearly
20 feet) down from its highest position.


The park attracts between 400 and 500 visitors on Sundays.
