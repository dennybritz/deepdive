A British soldier has been killed in a small arms fire attack
while on patrol in southern Iraq, the Ministry of Defence said
Sunday.


The soldier, from 2nd Battalion The Rifles, was carrying out
routine checks in the Al Ashar district of central Basra this
morning.


He was evacuated to the military base at Basra Palace but died of
his injuries later.


The death brings to 146 the number of British troops killed in
Iraq since the March 2003 invasion, led by the United States and
supported by Britain.


Britain's Prince Harry, son of heir to the throne Prince Charles,
is to be sent to southern Iraq as an army officer imminently,
although it is not yet clear whether he will take a frontline
role.
