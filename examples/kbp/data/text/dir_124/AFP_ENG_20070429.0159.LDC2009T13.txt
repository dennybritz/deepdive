Protests are taking place around the world Sunday as campaigners
demand that world leaders act to prevent further bloodshed in
Darfur on the fourth anniversary of the conflict's start.


The Global Day for Darfur, organised by a coalition including
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, will see activists
globally turn over more than 10,000 hourglasses filled with fake
blood.


These are designed to convey the message that delaying
intervention will cost lives in the troubled western region of
Sudan.


The focus of the day was in London, where hundreds of
demonstrators are expected to march on Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Downing Street office.


Activists have also erected a two-metre high hourglass of blood
in Trafalgar Square.


In Rome, hundreds of people took part in a march on the
Colosseum.


There was also a 200-strong protest in Berlin, where marchers
carried alarm clocks and a banner saying: "It is five minutes to
midnight, we're sounding the alarm!"


To coincide with the day, actors and musicians including Elton
John, George Clooney, Bob Geldof, Mick Jagger and Hugh Grant
released a statement calling on the international community to
take "decisive action" over the atrocities.


The conflict in Darfur has caused 200,000 deaths and led to two
million people being displaced, according to the United Nations.


Sudan contests the figures, saying that only 9,000 have died.
