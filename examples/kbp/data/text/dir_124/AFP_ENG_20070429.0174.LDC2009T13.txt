Seven Chinese workers captured in an attack on an oil venture in
Ethiopia last week have been released, their kidnappers told AFP
Sunday.


"We have released the Chinese at 2:00 pm (1100 GMT) today to the
ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross)," said
Abderahmane Mahdi, the London- based spokesman for the Ogaden
National Liberation Front.
