Italian Danilo Di Luca of the Liquigas team made up for some
recent near misses by winning the prestigious Liege-Bastogne-
Liege one-day classic held over 262km here Sunday.


Di Luca came over the finish line alone in just over 6hr 23min,
with last year's winner Alejandro Valverde of Caisse d'Epargne
finishing second ahead of Luxemburg's Frank Schleck.


World champion and former two-time winner Paolo Bettini of Quick
Step finished fourth ahead of another champion, Italian
compatriot Davide Rebellin.


It is the first time Di Luca, 31, has won the oldest classic in
existence, which was first held in 1892.


But it was Schleck who provided the spur for the Italian, who
recently finished on the podium of the two other Ardennes
classics - the Amstel Gold Race and Fleche Wallonne.


Schleck made the decisive move in the finale of the race, however
the CSC all- rounder's attack, with four kilometres to go, on the
descent leading to the final climb at Ans was soon followed by Di
Luca.


Both riders soon opened up a 10-sec gap on a group of around 10
riders, who waited too long before deciding to try and counter
attack.


Dutch ace Thomas Dekker made a late bid to catch the pair, then
Spanish ace Valverde pulled away from the group on the steady
climb towards the finish line.


As Di Luca rounded the final bend leading to the finish, Valverde
pulled ahead of Schleck but after 262km of racing over 12 steep
climbs the Spaniard simply had nothing left to offer.


Di Luca came over the finish line swinging his arms in triumph,
thus becoming the sixth Italian in the past decade to win Liege.
