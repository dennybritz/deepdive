German Christian faiths on Sunday signed a landmark agreement to
mutually recognise each other's baptismal rites.


Eleven churches, including the Catholic, Lutheran and Orthodox
churches, signed the agreement during a ceremony at the cathedral
in eastern Magdeburg. About 30 million Christians will be
affected by the agreement.


Wolfgang Huber, president of Germany's Council of Evangelical
Churches, said baptism represents "a strong link of Christian
unity."


The signing follows a 2002 initiative begun by German Cardinal
Walter Kasper.


Mutual agreements to recognise baptisms between local Protestant
and Catholic churches have been occurring over the last 30 years.
