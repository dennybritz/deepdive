US forces captured at least 72 suspects linked to Al-Qaeda and
seized bomb- making materials in a series of raids in two Iraqi
provinces on Sunday, the military said.


The raids were carried out in the restive Anbar and Salaheddin
provinces of Iraq in an attempt to "disrupt the Al-Qaeda
network," it said in a statement.


In the biggest raid, the military netted 36 suspects with links
to Al-Qaeda in the town of Samarra in Salaheddin province, north
of Baghdad, the military said.


Troops also found 20 five-gallon drums of nitric acid and other
bomb-making materials near Garmah, close to the former rebel
bastion of Fallujah in Anbar province of western Iraq.


US and Iraqi troops carry out raids almost daily in flashpoint
regions in a bid to quell the daily bloodshed in the war-torn
country.


Insurgents have continued to attack both security forces and
civilians. On Saturday, a suicide car bombing in the Shiite
shrine city of Karbala, central Iraq, killed 71 people.
