Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Sunday said his government
did not interfere in a recently reached deal to sell part of
Telecom Italia.


"Concerning Telecom, I have already said that the government was
not in a position to choose between one partner or another,"
Prodi told journalists. "Those who chose were those who had the
responsibility to do so."


Following long negotiations, 24 percent of the Italian telecom
giant's capital was purchased by an Italian-Spanish consortium.
The Saturday announcement of the purchase came two weeks after
the withdrawal of an offer by US company ATT.


Prodi's government, which had wanted the company to remain in
Italian hands, has been accused of protectionism by his right-
wing political opponents.
