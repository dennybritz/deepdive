Police have arrested two members of an armed gang who robbed a
jewellery store in a mall, in a rare attack in the relatively
safe Gulf emirate of Dubai, the official WAM news agency reported
on Sunday.


WAM said Dubai police chief Dahi Khalfan told reporters the two
suspects were arrested in the affluent emirate, while an
extradition request had been filed for a third member of the gang
being held in an unnamed European country.


The diamonds stolen in the April 15 robbery, worth more than four
million dollars, were returned to their owners, WAM said, without
giving the nationality of the suspects.


The robbers used a car to ram through one of the main glass gates
of Wafi City Mall, then drove down the wide aisles of the
shopping centre to the jewellery store.


A second getaway car followed and helped the thieves escape after
they ransacked the store within just two minutes.


The robbers fired several gunshots, shattering the shop windows,
local media quoted witnesses as saying after what appeared to be
the first attack of its kind in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates
in recent years.
