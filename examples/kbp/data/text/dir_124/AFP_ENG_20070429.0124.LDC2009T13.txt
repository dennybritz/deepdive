Legendary Russian cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich was
buried on Sunday at Moscow's historic Novodevichy cemetery.


The Orthodox religious ceremony was attended by around 2,000
mourners, many bearing flowers, and followed a funeral service in
the Christ the Saviour cathedral in central Moscow.
