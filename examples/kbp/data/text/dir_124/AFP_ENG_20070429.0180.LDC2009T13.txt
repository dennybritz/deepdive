Keiji Suzuki and Kosei Inoue, who have two Olympic and five world
gold medals between them, will spearhead Japan's assault at the
world judo championships in Rio de Janeiro in September.


The long-time rivals were selected for the national squad after
Suzuki, 26, won the open-weight national championship here on
Sunday by beating 20-year-old title-holder Satoshi Ishii in the
final.


Suzuki, the 2004 Athens Olympic heavyweight champion, will
compete in the under- 100kg light-heavyweight category.


Inoue, 28, who won the light-heavyweight gold at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics, will represent Japan in either the open or over-100kg
heavyweight division despite his loss to Ishii in the quarter-
finals. His triumph at the prestigious Paris tournament was one
of the reasons for his selection.


The All-Japan Judo Federation will choose between Yasuyuki
Muneta, the 2003 world heavyweight champion, and Yohei Takai
after camp training in Europe in July for the spot to be left
after Inoue decides his category.


Most of the other berths have been already decided on the basis
of the results from the category-by-category national
championships held earlier this month.
