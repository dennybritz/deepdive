The body of Bob Woolmer, the late coach of Pakistan's cricket
team, arrived in South Africa on Sunday morning, six weeks after
he was found dead in a Jamaican hotel room.


A casket bearing Woolmer's embalmed body arrived at the Cape Town
International Airport shortly before 10:00 am (0800 GMT) on a
South African Airways Flight from London.


An AFP photographer saw a wooden box wrapped in plastic sheeting
being offloaded from the Boeing 747 on the apron and taken with a
police escort to the cargo section of the airport. From there it
was collected by a van from the Doves funeral group.


Doves Western Cape general manager Theo Rix confirmed the box
contained Woolmer's remains.


Woolmer, 58, was found dead in his Kingston hotel room on March
18, the day after Pakistan had crashed out of the cricket World
Cup in an upset loss to Ireland. Police ruled his death a murder.
