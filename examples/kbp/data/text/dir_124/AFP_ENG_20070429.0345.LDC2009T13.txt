Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has turned down a request to meet
with Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, Baghdad's foreign
minister said Sunday, denying however that the refusal was an
outright snub.


On Sunday, The Washington Post reported Abdullah refused to
receive Maliki before the regional summit on Iraq security set
for next week because the Sunni leader is skeptical of Maliki's
Shiite government.


Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, however, said the report
was "not true," although he acknowledged a requested visit had
been denied.


"This time the Saudi king, his schedule was not suitable for this
timing," Zebari told CNN.


"So they did not decline it, but they said the king has an
internal tour which he does every now and again. So we couldn't
agree on the timing," he said.


The apparent snub comes as Saudi Arabia, long a US ally in the
Middle East, has been increasing critical of the US-backed Iraqi
government and the US role in the violence-wracked country.


In March, Abdullah called the US troop presence in Iraq an
"illegitimate foreign occupation," in a stinging repudiation of
US military venture.
