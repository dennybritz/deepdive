Bayern Munich must explain their actions to the German Fooball
Federation (DFB) over allegations they made an illegal approach
to Werder Bremen striker Miroslav Klose, it was revealed on
Sunday.


Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld and general manager Uli Hoeness met
with Klose, top-scorer at last year's World Cup, and his agent in
a Hanover hotel last week without Bremen's permission.


Klose, 28, is under contract until June 2008, but, according to
DFB regulations, a player can only be approached in the last six
months of his contract if his employer is informed.


"We are going to ask both clubs to exchange their versions of
events before we discuss the matter with them," said former
German international and DFB managing director Holger Hieronymus.


The meeting between Klose and Bayern only came to light after it
was exposed in the German press, forcing the 67-times capped
Klose to aplogise to Bremen officials.


The player insists the meeting was "purely informal", but has
strained both relations with his current employers and those
between Bremen and Bayern.


Bayern are likely to be disciplined if found guilty of improper
behaviour.


Klose, who scored five goals last summer to claim the World Cup's
golden boot, has been the target for several big European clubs
including Juventus and Barcelona.
