Spain's Rafael Nadal overpowered Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-4 on
Sunday to win the Barcelona Open for a record-equalling third
time and extend his clay-court winning streak to 72 matches.


The two-time Roland Garros champion kept the Real club trophy
safely in home hands for the fifth year in a row.


Nadal became only the second man after Swede Mats Wilander
(1982-1984) to win three straight editions of the tournament.


Nadal has now defended his first two clay-court trophies from
last season with the Rome Masters starting in a week his next
objective.


The 20-year-old remained a perfect 15-0 in clay court finals
after collecting his 20th career title.


Argentinian Canas, 29, was playing his third final of the year
after winning in Costa do Sauipe in February and finishing
runner-up to Novak Djokovic a month ago in Miami.
