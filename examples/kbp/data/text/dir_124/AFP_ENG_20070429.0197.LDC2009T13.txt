Afghanistan Sunday called on neighbouring Iran to stop
repatriating tens of thousands of Afghan refugees, saying the
destitute country could not afford to resettle them.


More than 25,000 Afghans have been sent back by Iranian
authorities since April 21, and more are being forced out,
according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR).


"We would like to ask Iran to not repatriate Afghan refugees. Our
capacity is very limited to receive a big number of refugees,"
foreign ministry spokesman Sultan Ahmad Baheen said.


"Taking into consideration our good relations with Iran and
international laws for refugees, we expect the Iranian government
not to force out refugees in big numbers. It would create lots of
problems for us here," Baheen said.


A UNHCR official on condition of anonymity said Iran had decided
to repatriate some half a million Afghans living as refugees in
the Islamic republic.


Two million Afghans, more than half of them unregistered, are
living in Iran while another two million are in Pakistan, having
fled during the decades of conflict in their troubled homeland.
