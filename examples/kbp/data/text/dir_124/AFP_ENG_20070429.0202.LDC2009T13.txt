The European Union is "willing to support change" in Cuba, a
Spanish newspaper quoted German Foreign Minister and current EU
president Frank-Walter Steinmeier as saying on Sunday.


Steinmeier told Catalan daily El Periodico the issue of future EU
relations with Cuba would be raised at the next Council of the
European Union meeting.


Spain, which has spearheaded efforts to revive EU-Cuba relations
hurt by Havana's jailing of 75 dissidents in 2003, decided to
renew its ties with the island earlier this month.


"This step forward ... is not an affront to the EU in general and
the German presidency in particular," Steinmeier said, adding
that Spain would write up a report on the subject for its
European partners.


"I am convinced that we (the EU members) will adopt agreements
where it will be clear that the EU as an organisation is willing
to support change" on the island, Steinmeier said.


"It is possible that the young generations of Cuban politicians,
who have had access to power, will move the country towards
opening. There are some signs in this direction," he added.
