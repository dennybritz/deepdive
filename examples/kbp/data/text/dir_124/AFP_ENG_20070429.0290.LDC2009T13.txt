Two-time snooker world champion Ronnie 'Rocket' O'Sullivan
dominated the first session of his world championship second
round match with Australia's Neil Robertson here on Sunday taking
a 6-2 lead.


The Englishman is bidding to avenge two defeats at the hands of
Robertson this season which has seen the Australian become the
only cuesman to win two ranking tournaments.


Neither player was on top form, producing their best play in the
opening two frames as Robertson made a clearance of 87 to take
the first one while O'Sullivan replied with a break of 104 in the
second.


However with Robertson seemingly out of sorts, just as he had
been in the first round, O'Sullivan eased into a 5-1 lead as the
Australian committed some awful howlers.


He did claw back to 5-2 after a break of 70, but let O'Sullivan
back in to take the last.


A drawn-out third frame contained a contender for shot of the
championship as Robertson escaped from a difficult snooker with a
breathtaking swerve shot.


Unfortunately for the world number 13, he then produced one of
the worst misses of the week on the frame ball blue which seemed
to rock his confidence badly.


A fluked red in the fourth helped O'Sullivan to extend his lead,
and Robertson fared little better after the mid-session interval
with several chances passing him by.
