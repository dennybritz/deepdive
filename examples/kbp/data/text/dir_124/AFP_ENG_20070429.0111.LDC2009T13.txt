A well-known news reader from Iraqi state television was shot and
wounded on Sunday in front of her Baghdad home, her network told
AFP.


Amal al-Muderas was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the mixed
Khadraa district of western Baghdad, security sources said,
apparently the latest victim of attacks aimed at state-run
Iraqiya television.


"She was wounded and she's in the hospital," said a senior
colleague at Muderas's station, on condition of anonymity. Medics
at the city's Al-Yarmukh hospital confirmed they were treating
her.


At least 158 journalists and media professionals, the vast
majority of them Iraqis, have been killed in Iraq since the US
invasion of March 2003, including another female presenter from
Iraqiya.
