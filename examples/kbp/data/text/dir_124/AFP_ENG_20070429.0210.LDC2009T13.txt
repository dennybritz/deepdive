US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Sunday she would not
rule out a meeting with her Iranian counterpart on the sidelines
of a multinational conference on Iraq security next week.


"I will not rule out that we may encounter each other," she said.


"This is not a meeting about the United States and Iran, this is
a meeting about Iraq and about what Iraq's neighbors and
interested parties can do to help stabilize the situation in
Iraq," she said.
