Italy's World Cup winning coach Marcelo Lippi said on Sunday that
the possibility of coaching Valencia is "interesting" but
confirmed there had been no official approach as yet.


Lippi has taken a break from coaching in the wake of Italy's
triumph in Germany last summer but, with the likelihood that he
will return to the fray in the summer, he has been linked with
various big clubs and national sides.


"Valencia are interesting but I haven't talked to (sports
director Amedeo) Carboni about anything," said Lippi, here on a
visit to watch the America's Cup on Sunday.


"I know Carboni, his work and effort. We are good friends but
haven't negotiated anything," Lippi added in reference to his
compatriot.


The Spanish media are speculating that current Valencia coach
Quique Flores will leave at the end of the season because of a
breakdown in relations between him and Carboni.


Flores took Valencia to the quarter-finals of this season's
Champion League.


The 2002 and 2004 Spanish champions are currently fourth in La
Liga and on course to return to Europe's top club competition
next season.


Lippi has said in recent weeks that he is starting to get the
coaching bug back again after some time off to relax in the wake
of the World Cup and that he is most likely to coach at club
level rather than another national side.


Chelsea, Real Madrid and Barcelona are just a few of Europe's big
teams with whom he has been linked.
