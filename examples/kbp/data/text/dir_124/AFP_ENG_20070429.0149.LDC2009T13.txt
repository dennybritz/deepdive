Iran's top national security official Ali Larijani arrived in
Baghdad on Sunday for a previously unannounced three-day visit,
Iranian and Iraqi state television channels reported.


The visit came as the neighbours announced that Iran would send
its foreign minister to a conference of world and regional powers
later this week to find ways to help Iraq build peace and
overcome its current security crisis.
