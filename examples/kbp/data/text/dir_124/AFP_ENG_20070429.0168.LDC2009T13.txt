A well-known newsreader from Iraqi state television was shot and
wounded on Sunday outside her Baghdad home, her network told AFP.


Amal al-Muderas was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the mixed
Khadraa district of western Baghdad, security sources said,
apparently the latest victim of attacks aimed at state-run Al-
Iraqiya television.


Muderas was comforted by colleagues as she lay bandaged in a bed
at the city's Yarmukh Hospital with head and chest injuries.


At least 158 journalists and media professionals, the vast
majority of them Iraqis, have been killed in Iraq since the US
invasion of March 2003, including another female presenter from
Al-Iraqiya.
