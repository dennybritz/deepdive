More families returned to the Somali capital on Sunday as calm
held for a third day after more than a week of fierce battles
between Ethiopian forces and Islamist fighters.


Hundreds of people aboard vans and trucks entered Mogadishu from
the outskirts of the city where they had camped during the nine
days of fighting that killed several hundreds and forced
thousands from their homes.


"We cannot stay outside of the capital if there is no fighting,"
Hudow Mohamed Farah, a father of six, told AFP.


"Every one is keen on getting back to his house and people."


The Ethiopian soldiers, who took control of insurgent strongholds
in northern Mogadishu on Thursday, patrolled the streets.


The forces, who entered Somalia last year and helped the weak
Somali government oust an Islamist force from south and central
Somalia, have since faced growing insurgence mainly in Mogadishu.


The United Nations said the clashes have displaced up to 400,000
people since February when the violence intensified.


"I was longing to see the situation return to normal in order to
get back to my house," said Werdiyo Ali Sugule, a mother of
three.


"My children had trouble living out of Mogadishu in the past
weeks. They suffered diarrhoea and other illnesses and I think it
is better for me to get to my house," she said.


On Saturday, Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed said the
Islamists had been defeated and urged displaced residents to
return home.


The fighting was some of the heaviest since the 1991 ouster of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre exploded into a bloody power struggle
in a country that has defied repeated attempts to restore
stability.
