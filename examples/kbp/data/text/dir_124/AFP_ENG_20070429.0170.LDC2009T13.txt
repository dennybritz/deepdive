Emirates Airlines and Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific on
Sunday suspended flights to Sri Lanka following a rebel air
strike around the troubled island's capital.


"For Emirates, the safety of its passengers is of paramount
importance," a spokesman for the Dubai-based carrier said, adding
that the situation would be reviewed within a day.


Emirates operated scheduled flights from Dubai to the Maldives,
Singapore and Indonesia through the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo.


However, the airline plans to operate a relief flight for any
stranded passengers.


Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspended flights to Sri
Lanka's international airport indefinitely, it said in a
statement Sunday.


Planes manned by Tamil Tiger rebels struck fuel depots around Sri
Lanka's capital early Sunday, briefly plunging Colombo into
darkness. Security forces lit up the night sky with anti-aircraft
fire.


The island's only international airport, located near the
capital, diverted flights after rebel aircraft were spotted in
its air space.


Flights were disrupted by air defence systems, officials said,
adding that one Indian jet was turned back and several departing
flights were delayed.


It is the second time in recent weeks that Cathay Pacific has
suspended flights to Sri Lanka.


It pulled services for a week late last month after Tamil Tiger
rebels launched an air raid on a military base next to the
airport.


Emirates currently owns a 43.6 percent stake and manages Sri
Lanka's national carrier, SriLankan Airlines.
