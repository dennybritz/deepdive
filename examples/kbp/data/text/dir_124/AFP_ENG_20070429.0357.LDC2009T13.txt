Dutch international midfielder Phillip Cocu has decided to quit
PSV Eindhoven but has not ruled out the possibility of extending
his career abroad.


"With PSV, it's finished. I will never play in the Netherlands
again," the 36 -year-old said Sunday after PSV were crowned Dutch
league champions on goal difference from Ajax.


"Now I'm going to give myself some holidays and I'll see if there
is a chance of still playing a little overseas."


Cocu began his career 20 years ago at Dutch club AZ Alkmaar, and
went on to play for Vitesse Arnhem, PSV (twice) and Barcelona in
Spain.


He won 101 caps for the Dutch national side, playing in three
European championships and two World Cups.


"His departure is a great loss for PSV because Phillips Cocu is
one of a kind. He will be impossible to replace," said PSV coach
Ronald Koeman.
