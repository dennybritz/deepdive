A law banning separatist Basque group Batasuna and allied groups
from next month's elections will be applied strictly, Spain's
prime minister said Sunday, ruling out moves by Batasuna to
covertly contest the polls.


"Today, I am repeating and reaffirming that the government will
apply the law in letter and in spirit," Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero said during a rally ahead of the May 27 municipal and
regional elections.


Batasuna has been prohibited as a party since 2003 because of its
ties to ETA, which has been blamed for over 800 deaths in its
four-decade campaign to achieve independence for the Basque
region in northern Spain and southern France.


ETA's political arm won 10 percent of the vote in regional
elections in 2001 and 20 percent in 1999 municipal elections.


In March, Batasuna presented a new party, Abertzale Sozialisten
Batasuna, to contest the May elections, but it too is expected to
be banned, as are supposedly apolitical "citizen lists" inspired
by Batasuna.


The prime minister on Sunday evoked the "intolerable violence" of
the past and underscored that the need of the hour was the
"necessary peace."
