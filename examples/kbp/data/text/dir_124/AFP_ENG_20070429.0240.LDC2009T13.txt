PSV Eindhoven were crowned Dutch league champions on Sunday on
goal difference from Ajax after both teams finished on 75 points
from 34 games.


PSV thumped Vitesse Arnhem 5-1 in their final match, while Ajax
could only manage a 2-0 win over Willem II Tilburg, handing the
Eindhoven side a better goal difference of just one.


It was PSV's 20th Dutch title, and third consecutive one,
ensuring they qualify for next season's Champions League, the
lucrative showcase event of European club football.


AZ Alkmaar, who went into the final day of the league on 72
points and with a better goals difference than both PSV and Ajax,
suffered a 3-2 loss to Excelsior Rotterdam to finish third.


Ajax, Alkmaar, Twente and Heerenveen will meet in the play-offs
to decide the second Dutch team to qualify for a Champions League
spot.


Den Haag were relegated into the second division.
