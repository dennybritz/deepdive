Suspected separatists shot dead a three-year-old boy in
Thailand's restive south Sunday, police said, hours after
hundreds of Muslims gathered to protest the killing of a retired
teacher.


The child was killed when insurgents in a truck opened fire on
the home of his father, a Muslim village headman, police said.
The father was also injured in the attack in Narathiwat province.


The shooting came after suspected Islamic rebels threw a grenade
into a crowd of people who were leaving the mosque in Pattani
after evening prayers late Saturday.


Moments later, the insurgents opened fire on the crowd outside
the mosque, police said, killing a former teacher and injuring
three people.


Pattani is one of three southern province, along with Yala and
Narathiwat, beset by separatist violence.


The attack sparked a protest at the mosque on Sunday, as up to
1,000 mourners gathered for the funeral of the 67-year-old
retired teacher.


Police said more than 100 veiled women and their children staged
a short protest demanding peace in the south, where more than
2,100 people have been killed since the latest insurgency erupted
in January 2004.


"Mostly women and children, hiding their faces behind veils, came
to protest and call for peace. They only protested for one hour
before leaving," said police colonel Thawal Nakrawong.


Violence has surged recently in the three provinces, despite
efforts by Thailand's new, military-backed government to calm
tensions in the Muslim- majority region.
