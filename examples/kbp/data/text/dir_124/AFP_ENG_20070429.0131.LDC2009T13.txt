A young French woman freed by the Taliban after 24 days in
captivity in Afghanistan arrived back in France early Sunday, a
source said.


The source, who asked not to be named, said the aid worker had
been taken "to a calm place where she is resting and will undergo
a medical examination".


She will then be questioned, as is customary in such cases, by
the French secret service who will try to find out as much as
possible about her detention.


Celine Cordelier, who is aged between 20 and 30, was captured on
April 3 in the southwestern province of Nimroz with another
French volunteer, Eric Damfreville, and three Afghans.


They were all working for the non-governmental organisation Terre
d'Enfance (A World For Our Children).


Cordelier was freed in the southern province of Kandahar on
Saturday with a message from her captors demanding the withdrawal
of France's troops in the NATO-led International Security
Assistance Force.
