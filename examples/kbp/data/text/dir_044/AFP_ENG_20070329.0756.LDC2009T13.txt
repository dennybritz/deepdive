The extra-terrestrial costume worn by an actor in the 1979 sci-fi
classic "Alien" will be auctioned in Los Angeles next month, a
dealer said Thursday.


The costume, created by Swiss surrealist artist Hans Rudolf
Giger, will be offered at an initial price of 75,000 dollars on
April 5, said Profiles in History, a dealer in historical
documents, artifacts and Hollywood memorabilia.


The estimated value of the scary creature's outfit is between
100,000 and 120,000 dollars.


Giger's work in visual effects for "Alien" won him an Oscar in
1980.


The blockbuster, directed by Ridley Scott, spawned three sequels.
