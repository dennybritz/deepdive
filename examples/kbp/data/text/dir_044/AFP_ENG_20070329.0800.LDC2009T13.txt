South Korea plans for the first time to send athletes to North
Korea's marathon next month, an annual event celebrating the
birthday of the communist state's founder, officials said Friday.


Two professional marathon runners, Jae In-Mo and Kil Gyung-Sun,
will travel to the North to attend the competition on April 15 in
Pyongyang.


"It would mark the first presence by the South's professional
athletes in the North's marathon event," said Kim Kang-Tae, the
official in charge of the exchange at Seoul's National Sports
Promotion Fund.


North Korea stages the event to mark the birthday of Kim Il-Sung,
father of the regime's current leader Kim Jong-Il.


It draws athletes mainly from China, eastern Europe and Africa,
he added.


The South Korean team will be led by coach Hwang Young-Jo, who
won gold at the marathon in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.


The two Koreas, which remain technically at war since the 1950-53
conflict, seek rapprochement through sports exchanges, but they
have been in suspension in recent months amid tensions over
Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.


The exchanges have only revived since the North in February
agreed to shut down its main nuclear facilities by mid-April in
return for economic aid and diplomatic benefits.


North Korea's under-17 football team has been on a 30-day
training camp in the South's southern island of Jeju since March
20.


The two Koreas have also been in talks aimed at fielding a
unified team to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
