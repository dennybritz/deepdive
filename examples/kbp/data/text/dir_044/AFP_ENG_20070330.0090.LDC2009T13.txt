Australian share prices are expected to rise next week, with
gains in the banking and media sectors wiping out the last traces
of losses suffered during a recent downturn, dealers said Friday.


They said a relaxation of media ownership restrictions taking
effect next week and the chance of an interest rate hike boosting
banks meant the market was buoyant.


For the week to March 30 the benchmark SP/ASX 200 closed up 47.2
points or 0.72 percent at 5,995.0, less than 100 points lower
than the index's all-time record of 6,044.0 set in late February.


The main event next week will be the Reserve Bank of Australia's
monthly monetary policy meeting Tuesday, with opinion split on
whether inflation fears will prompt a rise in interest rates.


Commsec chief equities economist Craig James did not expect rates
to move from 6.25 percent.


"If the Reserve Bank was to change interest rates on Tuesday, it
would need fresh justification. And simply there haven't been any
major changes in recent weeks," he said.


"The job market remains tight but wage growth is still hovering
around four percent. Economic growth was above expectations for
the December quarter, but the annual growth pace is still below
normal.


"On the other side of the ledger, the Australian dollar is at
decade highs against the greenback, and that will serve to push
down prices of imported goods and make life difficult for
Australian businesses."
