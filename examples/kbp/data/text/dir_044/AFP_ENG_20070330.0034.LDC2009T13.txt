Spanish national carrier Iberia said Friday it had received a
request for information from US private equity firm Texas Pacific
Group which is considering a takeover bid.


The airline signalled last week it was ready to look at a merger,
with consolidation of the industry expected to gather pace after
the EU-US deal to open up transatlantic air travel.


The TPG bid would value Iberia at 3.60 euros a share.


Iberia said in a statement that TPG has said it will analyse the
information over the next 20-30 working days, and possibly launch
a bid within 10 working days after that.


Iberia's board will meet in the coming days to decide on the
request, it said.
