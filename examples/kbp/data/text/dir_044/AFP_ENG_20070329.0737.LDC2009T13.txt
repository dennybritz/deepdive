A moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 4.7 hit Japan's
northern island of Hokkaido early Friday, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or casualties, officials said.


The quake occurred at 5:21 am (2021 GMT) with its epicentre
located at a depth of 60 kilometers (35 miles) below the Tokachi
area on the south coast of the island, the meteorological agency
said.


There was no danger of a tsunami following the tremor, the agency
said.


A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 hit the Noto
peninsula in central Japan on Sunday, killing one person and
injuring more than 200 others.


More than 880 houses were damaged in Sunday's quake and the
region has been jolted by hundreds of aftershocks.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes. A
7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe in January
1995 killed more than 6,400 people.
