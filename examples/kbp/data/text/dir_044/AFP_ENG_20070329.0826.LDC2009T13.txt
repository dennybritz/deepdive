Police using tear gas and water cannon clashed with student
protesters in Santiago Thursday and arrested at least 475 across
Chile, officials said.


Demonstrators were demanding better public transit, Santiago
governor Adriana Delpiano said.


The annual "Day of the Young Fighter" protest commemorates the
1985 police killings of two students during the regime of late
dictator Augusto Pinochet.


The commemoration called by leftists this year was marked by
anger over Santiago's reorganized public bus system, which users
say causes undue waiting at stops.


Police deployed 4,000 officers and a dozen armored personnel
carriers around the city for the event.


Some hooded protestors threw Molotov cocktails in the south of
Santiago, and the capital's universities closed early Thursday to
prevent a spillover of the protests onto their campuses.


"During the day we had a national number of arrests totaling
475," Deputy Interior Minister Felipe Harboe said.


Harboe also said that most of those arrested in the afternoon
were minors who were causing trouble near the presidential
palace, La Moneda, in the center of the capital.


By nightfall, the violence had spread to poor neighborhoods,
where protesters set up barricades and exchanged gunfire with
police officers, according to television footage.


Students launched the first protest of President Michelle
Bachelet's term last year by demanding free student access to
public transportation.
