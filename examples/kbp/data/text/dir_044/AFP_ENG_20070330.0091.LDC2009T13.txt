Indian police have arrested the leader of a gang implicated in
more than 250 serious crimes including murder and robbery,
officials said.


Mohammed Salim Qureshi, the boss of the 31-member gang in the
northern state of Uttar Pradesh was arrested late Thursday after
one of five recent murder victims' mobile phones was tracked to
him.


Qureshi has confessed to the crimes, senior Uttar Pradesh police
chief Deepesh Juneja told AFP overnight, adding that officers
were also closing in on other suspected gang members.


"Their modus operandi was to offer people rides in cars or mini-
vans and  kill them" at desolate places after robbing the
victims, Juneja told AFP from Meerut, about 400 kilometres (250
miles) southwest of the state capital Lucknow.


The gang also targeted elderly people living on their own and
took the lives of at least 40 police officers, Juneja said.


Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 180 million, has a reputation
of being one of India's most crime-ridden states.


According to police records, 17,315 people were murdered in the
past three years in the state, of which 5,482 cases were
registered last year alone.


In December, police also recovered the skeletal remains of 19
people -- mainly children -- from the backyard of a bungalow in
Uttar Pradesh's Noida district, on the outskirts of New Delhi.


Political analysts believe the state's crime record will be a
major issue in seven phased provincial polls beginning April 7
and ending May 8.
