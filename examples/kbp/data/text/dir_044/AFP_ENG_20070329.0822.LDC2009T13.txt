Chinese share prices fell 0.87 percent in Friday morning trade
amid profit- taking with banks and property developers under
pressure, dealers said.


They said investors were cashing out after the extending gains in
the past few days while solid interest remained in the blue chips
with the expectation that the launch of index futures would push
the benchmark higher.


"The market saw some profit-taking ahead of the weekend after
consecutive session gains, with some heavyweight sectors such as
steel remaining in favor on the back of institutional buying,"
said Wu Dazhong, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo Securities.


"The launching of index futures could be a bit earlier than
expected, maybe as soon as next month, so the interest in
heavyweight blue chips will continue until then, which means the
market should continue its upward trend in the near future," Wu
added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares, ended the morning down 27.89 points at 3,169.65.


The Shanghai A-share Index was down 29.53 points or 0.88 percent
at 3,331.29 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was down 2.31 points
or 0.27 percent at 854.01.
