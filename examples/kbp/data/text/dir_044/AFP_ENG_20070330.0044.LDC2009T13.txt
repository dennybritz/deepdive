British finance minister Gordon Brown and Defence Secretary Des
Browne arrived in Afghanistan on Friday on a surprise visit to
British troops, the Ministry of Defence said.


Brown said: "One of the things I will be saying to the forces I
meet is you become ever more aware of the risks and dangers they
are having to undergo and the courage and the bravery of the
troops themselves."


Speaking about the 15 British Royal Navy personnel being held in
Iran, he added: "Overnight, the United Nations resolution is
calling definitively for their release. That's the unanimous view
of the international community."


Tehran released a second letter apparently written by the only
woman among the group, 26-year-old Faye Turney, in which she
suggested it was time for Britain to withdraw its troops from
Iraq.


"The treatment of Faye Turney is cruel, callous, inhuman and
unacceptable," Brown said.
