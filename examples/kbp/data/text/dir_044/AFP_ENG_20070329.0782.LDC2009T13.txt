Japanese share prices rose 0.43 percent in morning trade Friday
as investors cheered an upward revision to US economic growth
that helped lift Wall Street overnight, dealers said.


They said that investors were also poring over a raft of domestic
data, including the first drop in Japan's consumer prices for 10
months.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 74.33 points to 17,338.27 by the lunch break.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section added 8.63 points or 0.50 percent to 1,719.31.
