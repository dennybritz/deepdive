Insurgents in Iraq killed a US soldier in a roadside bomb attack
in Baghdad amid a massive security crackdown in the city, the
military said on Friday.


The soldier was killed and another wounded on Thursday when the
bomb exploded in a southern area of the capital.


The latest casualty brought the US military's losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion to 3,243, according to Pentagon.
