A series of natural disasters is set to hit Indonesia's finances
this year with the country's budget deficit likely to rise
sharply, reports said Friday.


National Planning Minister Paskah Suzetta cited the costs of
managing a "mud volcano" that have made 15,000 homeless in East
Java since May 2006, causing massive damage to infrastructure.


The mud flowing out of a gas exploratory drilling well in
Sidoarjo has submerged whole villages and flooded 600 hectares
(1,500 acres) of land.


Earlier this month a quake with a magnitude of 6.3 struck Sumatra
island, flattening buildings and killing at least 70 people.


Weeks before flooding affected a total of 500,000 in Jakarta,
leaving 80 dead and dozens missing in the capital.


Although Suzetta, quoted in the Koran Tempo newspaper, said the
government has not accounted for the total damage caused by the
mud disaster, the bill is likely to exceed earlier official
estimates of 7.6 trillion rupiah (835.16 million dollars).


The Indonesian government says this year's budget deficit could
widen to between 1.5 and 2 percent of gross domestic product
after an earlier estimate of 1.1 percent.


Other disasters adding to the bill include massive floods and
landslides in northern Sumatra last December, which killed dozens
and forced 350,000 to flee their homes.


In June, floods on the island of Sulawesi left 250 dead, 100
missing and 13,000 homeless.
