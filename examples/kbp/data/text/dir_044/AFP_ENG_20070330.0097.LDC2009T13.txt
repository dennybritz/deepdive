The German economy, the biggest in the 13-country eurozone, is
hoping to cut its public deficit to 1.2 percent of gross domestic
product this year, the finance ministry said Friday.


The figure had already been leaked in the press earlier this
week, but the ministry announced that it would officially inform
the European Commission of this year's deficit target later on
Friday.


Under the terms of the European Stability and Growth Pact,
eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in
excess of 3.0 percent of GDP.


Germany, the pact's main architect, had been in breach of that
rule every year since 2002.


But a booming economy and bountiful tax revenues enabled Berlin
to report a deficit ratio of 1.7 percent last year.


Overall public debt was also expected to fall again this year to
66.7 percent of GDP from 67.9 percent in 2006, the ministry said.


The stability pact stipulates that eurozone members' debt ratio
must not exceed 60 percent.


A country's public deficit is the difference between state
revenues and public spending. The public debt is the cumulation
of past annual spending deficits.


"In view of the robustness of the global economy and the high
level of competitivity of the German economy, conditions have
been as good as they are for a long time for growth driven by
investment and private consumption," the ministry said.


Officially, Berlin is pencilling in growth of 1.7 percent this
year after 2.7 percent last year, but most observers are
substantially more optimistic.
