German luxury car maker BMW is in talks with Chinese regulators
to sell its vehicles to high-ranking officials, a lucrative
market segment formerly dominated by rival Audi, state media said
Friday.


"The government purchase sector is important for us and we have
the confidence to enter it," said Christoph Stark, president and
chief executive officer of BMW Group China, according to the
China Daily.


Industry data showed that officials at all levels in China spent
70 billion yuan (9.1 billion dollars) buying vehicles last year,
the report said.


This has made government purchase a very attractive market
segment that both foreign and domestic car makers are trying to
tap.


The sector was dominated by Audi with its popular A6 sedans until
Mercedes- Benz's China-made sedans made their way to the
governments' shopping list earlier this month, the report added.


Last November, BMW's joint venture with Brilliance China Auto in
northeast China launched a new series of sedans specifically
aimed at the government segment.


BMW's 2006 sales jumped 51.3 percent from a year earlier to
36,357 units, including 22,550 locally made 3 and 5 Series
sedans.


Audi sold 80,808 units in China last year, up 39 percent from
2005 and Mercedes- Benz's sales in China and Hong Kong rose 32
percent to 21,200 cars, the report said.
