Retail sales in Germany rose slightly in February, recovering
quickly from a drop the previous month connected with the steep
rise in value-added or sales tax (VAT) which came into effect on
January 1, official data showed on Friday.


German retail sales edged up by 0.9 percent in price, seasonally
and calendar- adjusted terms in February from the figure for
January, the federal statistics office Destatis said in a
statement.


On a 12-month basis, retailers reported a decline in business of
1.6 percent in February, the statisticians calculated.


With effect from January 1, the government raised VAT by three
full percentage points to 19 percent, the biggest-ever single
increase, in a move which experts said would weigh on consumer
spending and put the brakes on the economy as a whole.


But the fears of any such negative effects appear to be fading
fairly quickly.
