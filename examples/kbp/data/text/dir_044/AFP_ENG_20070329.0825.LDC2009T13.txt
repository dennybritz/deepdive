Hollywood is planning a remake of the Hong Kong gangster drama
"Exiled", cashing in on the success of "The Departed", the Oscar-
winning US version of another Hong Kong hit, a report said
Friday.


Media Asia has sold the rights for "Exiled" -- director Johnnie
To's thriller set in Hong Kong and Macau -- to Samuel Hadida, the
producer of the 2006 horror flick "Silent Hill", the South China
Morning post reported.


The film will be turned into a big-budget action feature, the
paper said. It was not immediately clear whether To would be
involved in the project.


"The actual negotiation took a few months, from late last year.
It just looks as though the interest came after (the Academy
Awards)," Jeffrey Chan, head of distribution at Media Asia, was
quoted as saying.


"Exiled" is the third overseas big sale for Media Asia, a string
of successes which started when "Infernal Affairs" became "The
Departed", which took home Oscars for best picture and best
director Martin Scorsese.


Another Hong Kong thriller, "Confession of Pain", will be redone
in Tinseltown, with Leonardo DiCaprio -- who starred in "The
Departed" -- as the lead.
