HSBC, the British-based banking giant, will set up a retail
operation in Japan early next year and aims to open as many as 50
branches within four years, a newspaper reported on Friday.


HSBC will seek to steal wealthy customers away from the Japanese
banks and vie with US financial giant Citigroup which is
expanding its Citibank network in the world's second-largest
economy, the London-based Financial Times said.


The investment will cost "hundreds of millions" of dollars, with
stores focused mainly in the Tokyo area initially, the FT
reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the situation.


HSBC spokeswoman Vinh Tran in Hong Kong said that HSBC was
considering entering the Japanese retail market but that no
decision had been made yet.


"There are discussions underway but no details have yet been
firmed up. We will focus on the mass-affluent sector and we do
have plans to expand the distribution network," she told AFP.


HSBC already has a presence in Japan but it mainly focuses on
wholesale banking and securities operations.
