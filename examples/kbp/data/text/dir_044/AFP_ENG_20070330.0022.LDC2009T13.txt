The crew of the International Space Station returned on board
Friday after moving a Soyuz spacecraft from one docking port to
another to make way for another spacecraft, Russia's space
control centre said.


"The cosmonauts ... have returned from the Soyuz back to the
station," Interfax quoted a spokesman at the centre as saying.


Piloted by Russian Mikhail Tyurin, the Soyuz was moved from an
Earth-facing port of the ISS' Zarya module to another module to
make way for a Soyuz that will bring Russians Fyodor Yurchikhin
and Oleg Kotov and US space tourist Charles Simonyi.


It took about half an hour for the crew, who also include
Americans Michael Lopez-Alegria and Sunita Williams, to manoeuvre
the Soyuz from one port to the other, during which they travelled
about a third of the way around the Earth, the US space agency
NASA said on its Internet site.


The new crew are due to blast off from Kazakhstan's Baikonur
space centre on April 7.
