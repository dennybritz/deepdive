At least eight civilians were killed and several others wounded
in eastern Sri Lanka Friday as government troops and Tamil Tiger
rebels exchanged artillery and mortar fire, officials said.


Four men and four women were killed when they were hit by shells,
a military official in Batticaloa, 303 kilometres (189 miles)
east of here said by telephone.


The defence ministry said the civilians were killed as a result
of firing by Tamil Tiger rebels into populated areas of the
Batticaloa district. There was no immediate comment from the
Tigers.


There has been heavy fighting between the two sides in the
coastal Batticaloa region where the military captured a Tiger
base on Wednesday.


The Tiger rebels are leading a drawn out campaign for
independence. More than 4,000 people have been killed in the
latest wave of fighting since December 2005 despite a truce
arranged by peace broker Norway in 2002.
