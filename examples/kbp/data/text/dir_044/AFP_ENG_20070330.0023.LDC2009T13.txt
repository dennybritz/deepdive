US equity firm Carlyle Group said Friday it had bought a 49
percent stake in China's Yangzhou Chengde Steel Tube Co Ltd for
80 million dollars.


The deal, which was completed Thursday, has received all
necessary regulatory approvals, Carlyle said in a statement.


The acquisition will support Yangzhou Chengde's further growth in
domestic and overseas markets, it said.


Yangzhou Chengde, based in Yangzhou city in east China's Jiangsu
province, is a private manufacturer of large-diameter seamless
steel pipes, used in the chemical and power industries.


Carlyle has invested in industrial companies throughout the
world, including John Maneely Co, North America's largest steel
tube manufacturer.


The investment was made via Carlyle's 1.8-billion-dollar Carlyle
Asia Partners II fund, the statement said.


The US company has made a slew of investments in Chinese
industrial and financial firms over past years, not always
without courting controversy.


Last week, Carlyle agreed to pay 1.8 billion yuan (233 million
dollars) for a reduced 45 percent stake in Chinese machinery
maker Xugong Construction Machinery, a deal still subject to
regulatory approval.


The Chinese government rejected Carlyle's initial offer in
October 2005 of buying an controlling 85 percent stake in Xugong
for 375 million dollars as fears were rising over foreign control
in a key Chinese industry.
