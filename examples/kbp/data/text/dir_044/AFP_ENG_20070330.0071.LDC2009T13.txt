The German economy, the biggest in the 13-country eurozone, is
hoping to cut its public deficit to 1.2 percent of gross domestic
product this year, the finance ministry said Friday.


Under the terms of the European Stability and Growth Pact,
eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in
excess of 3.0 percent of GDP.


Germany, the pact's main architect, had been in breach of that
rule every since 2002.


But Berlin was able to report a deficit ratio of 1.7 percent last
year thanks to the booming economy.
