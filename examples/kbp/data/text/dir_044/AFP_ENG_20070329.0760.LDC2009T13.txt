Britain's biggest commercial broadcaster ITV and its partner
Setanta Sports have won the rights to broadcast the English FA
Cup and England's home international matches, according to
several British media reports.


The BBC and satellite broadcaster BSkyB had previously shared the
rights to the two sports offerings, and their four-year deal with
the Football Association is set to expire next summer.


The Football Association was reportedly set to announce the deal
later on Friday.


"This is a massive coup for both companies," an unnamed source
close to the situation told the Financial Times.


According to the reports, the winning bid came in at around 420
million pounds (619 million euros, 824 million dollars), about 50
million pounds more than the dual B offer.


The Daily Telegraph reported that the ITV-Setanta deal means that
ITV will broadcast 13 FA Cup matches, with its partner
broadcasting 17, though ITV will have the first choice match in
every round of the tournament.


ITV will also have the majority of England matches.


The deal will be seen as a blow to the BBC, which also lost
chairman Michael Grade to rivals ITV in November.
