Six top Islamic militants convicted of masterminding bomb attacks
in Bangladesh in 2005 were hanged early Friday, the national
prison chief said.


"They were hanged in four different jails and their dead bodies
were handed over to their families," inspector general of prisons
Brigadier Zakir Hassan told AFP.


The six executed include Shaikh Abdur Rahman, leader of the
outlawed Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and his deputy,
Siddiqul Islam Bangla Bhai.


The six, whom police accuse of being members of JMB's decision-
making body, were condemned to death in May 2006 over bombings
that killed two judges in November 2005.


Authorities say the group was also behind 400 almost simultaneous
blasts that shook this country of 144 million people on August
17, 2005.


The attacks were part of a campaign of terror aimed at forcing
the country to replace its Muslim but secular legal system, which
dates back to the British colonial period, with traditional
Islamic, or sharia, law.


At least 28 people were killed and hundreds injured in the
blasts.
