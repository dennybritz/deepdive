The French economy grew by 2.1 percent in 2006, with the help of
a rise of 0.7 percent in activity in the final quarter of the
year, revised official data showed on Friday.


A previous set of figures from the statistics institute INSEE in
February had put growth at 2.0 percent.


The latest growth data however still put France in the bottom
half of economies in the 13-nation eurozone, which averaged
growth of 2.6 percent in 2006.


The French government had predicted growth last year would be
between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.
