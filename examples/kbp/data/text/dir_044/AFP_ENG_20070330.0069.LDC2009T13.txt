Iran said on Friday that the UN Security Council had been
exploited in the escalating row with Britain over the detention
of 15 British sailors, and defended its capture of the group.


The Security Council on Thursday expressed "grave concern" at the
detention of the 15 who were captured in Gulf waters a week ago,
and urged Tehran to allow consular access to the group but.


But the council but declined to back Britain with a call for the
immediate release of the 14 men and one woman.


"Unfortunately the Security Council was once again exploited by
issuing a statement about an affair which is not within the
Council's responsibility and is completely bilateral," Iran's
mission to the United Nations said in a statement carried by the
official IRNA news agency.


It defended the seizure of the Britons last Friday, insisting the
sailors "had violated the internationally recognised border
between Iran and Iraq."


"Iran had no option but to detain the British sailors to exercise
its right to sovereignty and prevent illegal entry into its
territory," the statement said.
