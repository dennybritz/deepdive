US investment group KKR on Friday increased its offer for
Alliance Boots, the biggest pharmacy chain in Europe, to 10.06
billion pounds (14.72 billion euros, 19.61 billion dollars) in
cash.


KKR, which is tabling a joint bid with Alliance Boots' executive
deputy chairman Stefano Pessina, has offered 1,040 pence per
share.


Alliance Boots on March 12 snubbed an offer worth 1,000 pence per
share. This time, however, the pharmacy group has agreed to open
its books to KKR and Pessina.


"The board has agreed to grant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
Ltd. and Stefano Pessina a limited period to undertake
confirmatory due diligence. A further announcement will be made
as and when appropriate," it said in a statement.


Alliance Boots shares rose 0.88 percent to 1,036 pence on
London's FTSE 100 in early trade Friday, which was just below the
renewed bid offer. London's leading share index was down 0.05
percent to 6,320.80 points.


Alliance Boots was created last year by the British merger of
pharmacy chain Alliance UniChem and health and beauty retailer
Boots.


In Britain, the group has 2,600 healthcare outlets, which include
1,500 community pharmacies. The combined group has more than
100,000 employees.
