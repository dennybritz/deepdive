Linde, the world's leading maker of industrial gases, said it has
agreed to sell its bottled gas activities in the United States to
US firm Airgas for 310 million dollars (232 million euros).


"We have signed a definitive agreement to sell our packaged gases
business with retail stores in the US to the industrial gases
company Airgas Inc. at an enterprise value of 310 million
dollars," it said in a statement late Thursday.


The activities represent annual sales of 346 million dollars and
operating profit of around 36 million dollars on a workforce of
approximately 1,400.


The closing of the transaction was still subject to regulatory
approval, Linde added.
