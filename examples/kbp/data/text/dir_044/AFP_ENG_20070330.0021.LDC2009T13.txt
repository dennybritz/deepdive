Japanese share prices closed down 0.14 percent on Friday despite
an upward revision to US economic growth which helped lift Wall
Street overnight, dealers said.


They said that investors were also poring over a raft of domestic
data, including the first drop in Japan's consumer prices for 10
months although the indicators were broadly in line with market
expectations.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 23.71 points to 17,287.65. The TOPIX index of all issues on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section added 2.93 points or
0.17 percent to 1,713.61.
