Chinese share prices closed mixed Friday as the Shanghai market
was hit by profit-taking in the banks while Shenzhen rose on
interest in steelmakers, dealers said.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, was down 13.55 points or 0.42 percent at 3,183.98,
slipping off record highs on much reduced turnover of 83.0
billion yuan (10.71 billion dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was down 14.47 points or 0.43 percent
at 3,346.35 on turnover of 82.68 billion yuan but the Shenzhen
A-share Index added 5.46 points or 0.64 percent at 861.78 on
turnover of 42.05 billion yuan, reversing Thursday's performance.
