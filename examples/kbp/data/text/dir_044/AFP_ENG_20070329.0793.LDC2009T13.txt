The US celebrity socialite Paris Hilton may face a three-month
prison sentence for violating her probation by driving with a
suspended license, a court official here said Thursday.


Hilton, heir to the hotel empire that bears her name, was stopped
in her car by police in western Los Angeles on February 27. The
city prosecutor's office confirmed Thursday she had violated the
terms of a probation for drunk driving issued the previous month.


"We are confident that we have sufficient evidence that her
license was suspended at the time she was driving and that she
had knowledge of that suspension," said Nick Velasquez, spokesman
for the Los Angeles prosecutor.


Hilton, 26, is to appear on April 17 before a judge who will
decide whether she receives a jail sentence, he said.


She came to wide public attention in 2003 in a home-made sex
video that was posted on the Internet, and has since appeared in
television shows and movies.
