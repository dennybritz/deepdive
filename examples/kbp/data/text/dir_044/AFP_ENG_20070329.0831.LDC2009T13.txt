One policeman was killed and four others injured in a roadside
bombing by suspected Islamic separatists early Friday morning,
four others were wounded, police said.


The 41-year-old senior sergeant major was killed on a highway in
Pattani province when the bomb exploded as their patrol vehicle
passed by, police said.


Four other officers were injured, one of them critically,
Lieutenant Colonel Norarat Thepchalerm said.


Pattani is one of three southern provinces along the Malaysian
border hit by three years of separatist unrest that has left more
than 2,000 people dead.


The violence has escalated since the military staged a coup in
Bangkok in September, despite a raft of peace initiatives by the
new government.
