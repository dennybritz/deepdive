Hong Kong share prices finished the morning session lower Friday
as investors stepped up profit-taking following yesterday's
strong technical rebound, dealers said.


They said sentiment was earlier buoyed by Wall Street's overnight
advance due to better-than-expected fourth-quarter US economic
growth but gave way to caution over rising crude oil prices.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning down 58.48 points or 0.30
percent at 19,763.30, after trading between a low of 19,705.56
and a high of 19,880.26.
