A vaccine against advanced prostate cancer could soon hit the US
market after a key health panel recommended that federal
regulators approve it, the vaccine's maker said.


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to decide
whether to approve Provenge by May 15, Dendreon Corp. said in a
statement Thursday.


The Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory
Committee recommended to the FDA that there was "substantial
evidence of efficacy and safety" of Provenge for the treatment of
patients with asymptomatic, metastatic, androgen- independent
prostate cancer, Dendreon said.


The FDA generally follows the panel's recommendations, but it is
not required to do so.


Dendreon-funded clinical trials on 127 prostate cancer patients
who no longer responded to hormone treatements had shown
promising results.


After three years, 34 percent of men treated with Provenge were
still alive compared to 11 percent who were given a placebo,
according to the study.


Patients taking Provenge lived on average four and a half months
longer than the others.


Prostate cancer is the third most common cancer in the world. In
the United States, more than one million men suffer from prostate
cancer and 27,000 die from it each year.
