Japan's Nissan Motor Co. said Friday it will recall more than one
million vehicles mostly in Japan after reports of cracks in the
fuel tank, but there was no safety risk.


The recall of 1,015,306 vehicles, which were made between 1991
and 2000, will cost about three billion yen (25.5 million
dollars), said Nissan spokeswoman Pauline Kee.


"We received 59 complaints. There was a crack in the fuel tank
that generated fumes and a strong smell. It is not a security
recall," she said.


The recall affects "Cube" mini-vehicles made between January 1998
and March 2000 and the "March" small car made between December
1991 and August 2000.


Given the age of the vehicles, Nissan estimates that only about
600,000 of the affected cars will still be in circulation, said
Kee.


Most of the vehicles were sold in Japan but some were shipped to
other Asian nations, Nissan said.
