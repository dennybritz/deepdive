A NATO soldier was killed and three wounded in clashes in eastern
Afghanistan, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force
said Friday.


ISAF gave no details of the incident which it said occured in
eastern Afghanistan. The death takes to 26 the number of foreign
soldiers to die in Afghanistan this year, including in accidents.


The area along the border with Pakistan sees some of the worst
fighting in an insurgency by the extremist Taliban, who were
toppled from government in late 2001 and are now waging a growing
insurgency supported by elements in Pakistan.


The 37-nation ISAF does not release the nationalities of its
casualties. Most of the foreign troops in Afghanistan, and
especially in the east, are US nationals.


A UN Security Council report released mid-March said the number
of insurgency related incidents in January 2007 was double that
of the same month last year.
