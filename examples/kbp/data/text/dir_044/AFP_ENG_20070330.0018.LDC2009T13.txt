A senior Malaysian minister said Friday the government will not
meet its Saturday deadline to declare a strategic partner for
ailing national automaker Proton, state media said.


Second Finance Minister Nor Mohamed Yakcop told Bernama news
agency that the government was still evaluating options to find a
partner.


He made no reference to a report on Friday that VW had pulled out
of talks with Proton, Bernama said.


The Straits Times in Singapore, citing a senior Malaysian
government official, said VW delivered the news on Thursday to
Khazanah Nasional, the government's investment arm which is
Proton's main shareholder.


"Clearly, they don't want to pour any resources into turning
Proton around," the newspaper cited the unidentified Malaysian
government official as saying.


It also quoted a Malaysian bank chief executive, who was aware of
VW's decision, as calling it "a major setback."


Proton officials Friday refused to comment on the report, while
Khazanah's spokesman Ahmad Shahizam Shariff could not be reached.


Proton's share price was sharply lower at the end of morning
trade on the Kuala Lumpur bourse, closing at 6.40 ringgit (1.85
dollars), down 0.25 ringgit or 3.76 percent.


VW's reported pullout from talks comes after the collapse earlier
this month of negotiations with French car giant PSA Peugeot-
Citroen.


The government had set its own deadline of March 31 to find a
partner for Proton.
