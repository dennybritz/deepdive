At least five Sri Lankan security force members were killed and
another wounded in a roadside explosion Friday in the north of
the country, officials said.


They were travelling along the main road near the de facto border
with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) when their
vehicle was hit by a Claymore mine blast at Parayanakulam, the
sources said.


The attack came as government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels are
locked in long- range attacks in the east of the island.


The Tiger rebels are fighting a decades-old battle for
independence. More than 4,000 people have been killed in a wave
of fighting since December 2005, despite a truce arranged by
peacebroker Norway in 2002.
