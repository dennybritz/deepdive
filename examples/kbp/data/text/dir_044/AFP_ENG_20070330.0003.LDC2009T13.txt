Indian police have arrested a gang leader implicated in more than
250 cases of murder and robbery since 2004 in the northern state
of Uttar Pradesh, officials said.


Mohammed Salim Qureshi, the alleged boss of the 31-member gang,
was arrested in western Uttar Pradesh's Meerut city, 65
kilometres (40 miles) from the Indian capital New Delhi late
Thursday.


Senior Uttar Pradesh police officer Deepesh Juneja told AFP
overnight that Qureshi has confessed to the crimes.


"Their modus operandi was to offer people rides in cars or mini-
vans and  kill them" at desolate places after robbing the
victims, he told AFP from Meerut, about 400 kilometres (250
miles) southwest of the state capital Lucknow.


The gang also targetted elderly people living on their own and
took the lives of at least 40 police officers, Juneja said.


The police closed in on Qureshi after tracking the mobile phone
of one of five victims murdered in the past fortnight, the
officer said, adding that police were also closing in on other
suspected gang members.


Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 180 million, is one of
India's most crime- ridden states.
