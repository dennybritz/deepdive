A New Zealand university researcher has won a government grant to
study the lifestyle habits of head-banging heavy metal fans.


The 96,000-dollar (68,000 US) grant over three years to student
Dave Snell will allow him to carry out his study, entitled "The
Everyday Life of Bogans: Identity and Community Among Heavy Metal
Fans."


In New Zealand and Australian slang, a bogan is an insulting term
for an unsophisticated lower-class person, the equivalent of
"trailer trash" in the United States.


But Snell is happy to describe himself as a bogan, saying he
loves heavy metal music -- distinctive for its thick, loud,
guitar-and-drums sound.


"The stereotype of a bogan is tight black jeans, a Metallica
t-shirt, a mullet or a shaved head and a love of beer and cars.
I'd very proudly call myself a bogan," he told Radio New Zealand
Friday.


The research will include studying different types of dancing to
heavy metal music -- head-banging or moshing -- as well as the
importance of tattoos and body piercings, he said.


Bogans offered a good case study of the importance of identity to
different groups of people, he said.


New Zealand's Tertiary Education Commission, which administers
the scholarships, defended the study.


"This research will help us to understand our communities and our
younger people," said commission senior manager Frannie Aston.
