A Vietnamese court on Friday sentenced dissident Catholic priest
Nguyen Van Ly to eight years in jail for spreading propaganda
against the state.


"The behaviour of the defendants amounts to the crime of
spreading propaganda against the Socialist state", judge Bui Quoc
Hiep said in the court in the central city of Hue.


Police said Ly was a founding member of the banned "Bloc 8406"
pro-democracy coalition, named after its April 8 launch last
year, and a driving force behind the outlawed Vietnam Progression
Party and another political group.


Ly, 60, has been jailed three times since the 1970s for a total
of 14 years for peaceful activism against the state.


His four co-defendants -- two men and two women -- received
lesser punishments ranging from six years in prison to an
18-month suspended sentence.
