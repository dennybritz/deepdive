Hyperventilating Japanese swimmer Sachiko Yamada collapsed Friday
after completing her 800-metres women's freestyle heat and had to
be helped out of the Rod Laver Arena in a wheelchair.


She finished seventh in 8 minutes 49.45 seconds and crumbled to
the ground after hauling herself out of the pool.


Onlookers rushed to help and she was seen wiping her face with a
towel as she was wheeled away.


She had fully recovered 30 minutes after the race and returned to
her hotel, officials said.


It is the second time that Yamada, 24 and competing in her fourth
world championships, has collapsed during the world
championships.


A similar scare happened on Monday after she raced the 1500m
freestyle. She received medical treatment but recovered.


"She didn't have a cold, and she didn't have a fever or suffer
from diarrhoea," Japanese team doctor Koichi Watanabe said
Friday.


"The factors causing hyperventilation can be too much stress,
(being) nervous, and tiredness.


"It is difficult to know the symptoms of this problem, however,
it is not unusual that the same condition occurs again.


"Studies show that apparently five to 10 percent of athletes do
suffer from hyperventilation after their races, so it is not an
unusual sight at all."


Yamada qualified 18th fastest overall in the 800m to miss out on
a place in the semi-finals.
