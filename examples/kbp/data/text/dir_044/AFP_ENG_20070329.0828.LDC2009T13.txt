China is likely to see a fifth consecutive year of double-digit
growth in 2007, the central bank said in remarks publich Friday,
just weeks after the government called for a slowdown in the
booming economy.


The world's fourth-largest economy is likely to expand by 10
percent this year, compared with 10.7 percent in 2006, the
central bank's research department said in a report published in
the China Securities Journal.


"The trade surplus is likely to maintain relatively fast growth
in the first half but the rising trend should ease in the second
half," the report said.


In a speech to lawmakers earlier this month, Premier Wen Jiabao
targeted eight percent growth in 2007.


Analysts almost immediately characterised the target as
unrealistic, saying it was mainly meant as a signal to lower-
level officials to refrain from going for growth at any cost.


The central bank research report suggested no clear trend in
economic growth throughout 2007, with slightly faster expansion
both early and late in the year.


The economy is expected to expand 10.2 percent in the first
quarter, 9.85 percent in the second, 9.8 percent in the third and
10.05 percent in the fourth, it said.


The report forecast consumer price inflation to be around 2.3
percent in 2007, higher than the 1.5 percent for full-year 2006
but below the three-percent upper limit set by the central
government.
