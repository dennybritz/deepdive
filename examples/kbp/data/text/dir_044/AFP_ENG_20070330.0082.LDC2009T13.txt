The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament on Friday
proposed scrapping a two-term limit on holding the presidency, a
move that could allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in office.


"I suggest we consider whether it is not necessary, considering
the many, the millions of appeals from our citizens, to revise
this norm," Sergei Mironov told a senate session in comments
broadcast on television.


Mironov said the new limit should be three terms in office.


The senate leader, who also heads up the A Just Russia party, a
pro-Kremlin group, also proposed extending the president's
mandate from the current four years to five or seven years in
office.


Under Russia's current constitution, Putin is not allowed to run
for a third consecutive term in office and must step down next
year. Presidential elections are scheduled for March 2, 2008.


Putin, who came to power in 2000, has high popularity ratings and
there have been calls from several local officials in Russia for
him to stay on for a third term.


The A Just Russia party was formed with Kremlin support last year
as a counterbalance to the ruling United Russia party.
