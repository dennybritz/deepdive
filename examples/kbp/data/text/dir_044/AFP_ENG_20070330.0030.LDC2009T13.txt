The death toll from a double suicide bombing in a popular Baghdad
market has risen to 82 with another 138 wounded, hospital sources
said on Friday.


The attacks on Thursday were the deadliest in the capital since
the US military launched a security crackdown with Iraqi troops
in a bid to wrest back control of Baghdad from insurgents and
sectarian militias.


Medics at four hospitals, principally the Imam Ali and Al-Kindi
hospital where most of the dead and wounded were taken, put the
combined death toll at 82 dead and 138 wounded.


The two bombers, wearing explosive vests, blew themselves up
after walking into the Al-Shaab market in a Shiite district of
northeastern Baghdad as shoppers were busy buying provisions
ahead of the weekend.


The market has been repeatedly bombed by Sunni extremists who
select popular areas for their death blows in order to cause
maximum casualties.
