Hong Kong police arrested 18 people in connection with a scam
that would increase their chances of gaining allocations to a
series of keenly sought initial public offerings (IPO).


Police said 10 men and eight women, aged between 20 and 60,
including two employeers of a brokerage company, were arrested
after they submitted multiple applications in each of the IPO
exercise.


They submitted the applications using their names but similar
identity card numbers with different addresses and occupations in
a bid to increase their chances of gaining allocations.


Each person is only entitled to one allocation. By gaining more
than one allocation, they could make profits by selling the
shares when their prices surged, police said.


The South China Morning Post said they were accused of filing 933
share applications for seven IPOs between October and December
last year, including the world's largest IPO, the 22 billion
dollars launched by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC).


Police said their investigations are still continuing and all the
18 arrestees are being detained for enquiries.
