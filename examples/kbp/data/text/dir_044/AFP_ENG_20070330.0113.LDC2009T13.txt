Local Taliban militants seeking to impose Islamic law blew up two
video shops and torched a cable television operator's office in
northwestern Pakistan, officials said Friday.


There were no casualties in the blasts which happened late
Thursday in Kohat, a town close to Pakistan's troubled tribal
regions bordering Afghanistan.


The attackers forced people out of the local office of World
Cable 2000 and sprinkled kerosene over it before setting it on
fire, the officials said.


Later they detonated crudely-made bombs at the video shops, which
were empty at the time. Both shops were badly damaged.


Residents said the attacks followed threats to the owners to shut
down their business because they were un-Islamic.


Northwestern Pakistan has seen previous attacks on video and
music shops blamed on extremists emulating the ultra-orthodox
Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.


A homemade bomb in a market in the main northwestern city of
Peshawar on March 18 damaged four music and video shops weeks
after their owners refused an order to close down from Islamic
hardliners.


There has been growing concern about the "Talibanisation" of
Pakistan, with heavy fighting in the tribal areas and another
northwestern town under curfew for the last three days following
clashes between militants and security forces.
