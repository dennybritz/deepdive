Britain's Office of Fair Trading on Friday referred BAA, the main
operator of British airports, to the country's Competition
Commission.


"This decision comes after a period of public consultation
following the OFT's earlier proposal to refer BAA Airports to the
CC published on 12 December 2006," a statement said.


"During the consultation over 60 responses were received from
parties including airlines, consumers and other organisations,"
it added.


The OFT had in December said that it believes the current market
structure does not deliver "best value" for air travellers in the
UK.


The watchdog had announced last June a preliminary investigation
into the market position of BAA, which was bought last year by a
consortium led by the Spanish construction group Ferrovial.


British airlines, led by British Airways, have called for the
break-up of BAA, which runs seven British airports including
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, that border London.


BAA owns also Southampton airport in south-east England, and
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen in Scotland.


According to the OFT, the seven airports have an annual turnover
of 2.0 billion pounds (2.96 billion euros, 3.92 billion dollars)
and handle over 60 percent of all air passengers in Britain.


The OFT has found also that in south-east England, BAA's airports
handle 90 percent of passenger trips, and these airports could
under separate ownership compete to attract air passengers.
