Six Japanese military officers left for Nepal on Friday to
monitor the kingdom's ceasefire for one year, the latest overseas
mission for officially pacifist Tokyo.


"We would like to exercise our duty with a sense of urgency,"
Lieutenant Colonel Katsunori Ishibasi, who heads the team, told
reporters before leaving Tokyo.


The six unarmed personnel will help monitor weapons and soldiers
as part of the UN mission observing the accord that ended the
Himalayan kingdom's bloody decade-long Maoist insurgency. Japan
is a major donor to Nepal.


It is the first mission since Japan created a full-fledged
defence ministry in January, upgrading its Defence Agency set up
after defeat in World War II.


Japan has been slowly expanding its military operations overseas
and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hopes to revise the pacifist US-
imposed 1947 constitution.


In Japan's most prominent deployment, it sent some 600 troops to
Iraq on a reconstruction mission. The soldiers returned last year
without suffering any casualties or firing a shot.


Abe's cabinet on Friday extended by two years an air mission
flying people and goods into Iraq for the US-led coalition and
the United Nations.
