France reduced its budget overspending to 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product last year and brought its public debt down to
63.9 percent of GDP, official figures showed on Friday.


The data from the statistics institute INSEE were below the
figures predicted by the government, which had forecast a public
deficit of 2.6 percent and public debt of 64.6 percent.


A country's public deficit is the difference between state
revenues and public spending. The public debt is the cumulation
of past annual spending deficits.


France's EU partners launched an action against Paris in 2003
after the French public deficit breached an EU limit of 3.0
percent of GDP the previous year.


But the action was dropped in January this year after France
brought its deficit below the three-percent limit in 2005 and was
seen to be reducing it even further in 2006.


Both France's centre-right UMP government and the opposition
Socialists have highlighted problems facing France over its
public deficit and debt during campaigning for a presidential
election at the end of April.


France's debt ratio has risen in recent years in breach of
eurozone rules that state that debt must be no greater than 60.0
percent of output or be falling consistently and structurally
towards this ceiling.
