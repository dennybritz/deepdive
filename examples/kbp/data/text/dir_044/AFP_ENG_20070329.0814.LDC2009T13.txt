Six top Islamic militants convicted of masterminding bomb attacks
in Bangladesh in 2005 were hanged early Friday, the national
prison chief said.


"They were hanged in four different jails and their dead bodies
were handed over to their families," inspector general of prisons
Brigadier Zakir Hassan told AFP.


The six executed include Shaikh Abdur Rahman, leader of the
outlawed Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and his deputy,
Siddiqul Islam Bangla Bhai.


The six, whom police accuse of being members of JMB's decision-
making body, were condemned to death in May 2006 over bombings
that killed two judges in November 2005.
