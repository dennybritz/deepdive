Hong Kong share prices closed 0.11 percent lower Friday, though
off their lows, as profit-taking eased toward the end of trade,
but with caution remaining over rising crude oil prices, dealers
said.


They said select property and financial stocks began drawing some
interest again and helped limit the market's overall losses.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 20.85 points at 19,800.93, off a
low of 19,705.56 and a high of 19,880.26. Turnover was 45.8
billion Hong Kong dollars (5.87 billion US).
