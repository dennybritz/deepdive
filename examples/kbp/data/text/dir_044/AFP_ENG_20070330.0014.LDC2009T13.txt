Five people were shot dead and four injured in an overnight
attack by suspected Islamic militants in Indian-administered
Kashmir, a defence official said Friday.


The attack took place in Mathiyani Gala village in the border
district of Rajouri, 180 kilometres (110 miles) from Indian-
Kashmir's winter capital Jammu late on Thursday, defence
spokesman D.K. Badola told AFP.


According to preliminary reports, the militants rounded up some
residents of the remote village before spraying them with
bullets, Badola said, adding that two villagers who escaped under
the cover of darkness had raised the alarm.


Security personnel had been sent to the area, he said.


A 17-year-old insurgency in Indian Kashmir has left 42,147 people
dead, more than a third of them civilians, according to official
figures released Monday.
