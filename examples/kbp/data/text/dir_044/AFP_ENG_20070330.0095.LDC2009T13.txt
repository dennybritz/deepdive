Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, 47, will undergo surgery to remove
a benign abnormal growth in his intestines, the palace said
Friday.


The news came three weeks after the palace announced his mother
Empresss Michiko had suffered intestinal bleeding. His wife,
Crown Princess Masako, has also been ill for several years,
limiting public appearances due to severe stress.


The palace said Naruhito, who is next in line to the
Chrysanthemum Throne, had a polyp in his duodenum, which is part
of the small intestines.


"A polyp has been detected in the duodenum of His Highness. It is
diagnosed to be benign and not large in size," a spokesman for
the Imperial Household Agency said. "It is scheduled to be
removed by endoscope at a convenient time."


On March 6, the agency announced the empress, 72, will take a
break from official duties for 10 days after she was found to
have suffered from bleeding in her intestines a few times.


The agency said her condition might been caused by mental stress.


Emperor Akihito, 73, underwent surgery in early 2003 for prostate
cancer.
