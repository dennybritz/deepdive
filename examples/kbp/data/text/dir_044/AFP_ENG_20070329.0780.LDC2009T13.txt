Hong Kong share prices opened little changed Friday, with some
investors taking profits after Thursday's strong gains, dealers
said.


However, they said sentiment remains positive following a
positive performance on Wall Street overnight after slightly
better-than-expected US fourth quarter economic growth data.


The Hang Seng Index opened down 10.92 points at 19,810.86.
