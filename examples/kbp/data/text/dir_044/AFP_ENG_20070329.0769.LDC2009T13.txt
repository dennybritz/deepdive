New Zealand's economic growth picked up to its fastest pace in 18
months in the December quarter, official figures showed Friday.


Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.8 percent in the last three
months of the year compared with the previous quarter, Statistics
New Zealand said.


This was the biggest rise since 1.0 percent recorded in the three
months to June 2005.


For the 12 months to December, however, growth came to a
relatively anaemic 1.5 percent, up marginally from 1.4 percent in
the year to September.


The growth figure for the quarter was slightly below economists'
expectations of around 0.9 percent and the central bank's
forecast of 1.0 percent.


In the three months to September, the economy posted a quarterly
increase of 0.3 percent.


The services/consumer sector, which accounts for around two-
thirds of the economy, grew by 0.9 percent in the quarter,
including a strong expansion in the finance, insurance and
business services industries, and the communications sector,
Statistics New Zealand said.


Goods-producing industries rebounded from two quarters of decline
with a 0.4 percent increase although manufacturing continued to
shrink with a 0.6 percent fall.


Household spending increased 1.1 percent in the quarter following
a modest 0.3 percent in the three months to September.
