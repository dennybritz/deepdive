The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament on Friday
proposed scrapping a two-term limit on holding the presidency, a
move that could potentially allow President Vladimir Putin to
stay in office.


"I suggest we consider whether it is not necessary... to revise
this norm whereby the same person can't hold the post of
president for more than two terms in a row," Sergei Mironov said
in comments broadcast on television.
