US oil giant Exxon Mobil, Saudi Aramco and Sinopec announced here
Friday two joint ventures worth about five billion dollars to
operate 750 service stations and a petrochemical refinery in
China.


"The two joint ventures, with a total investment of about five
billion dollars, are the first fully integrated refining,
petrochemicals and fuels marketing project with foreign
participation in China," the companies said in a a joint
statement.


The refining joint venture will expand one that already exists in
the southeastern province of Fujian, tripling production of
refined Saudia Arabian crude to 240,000 barrels per day, the
statement said.


Sinopec, China's top refiner, has a 50 percent stake in the
venture, while Exxon Mobil and Saudi Aramco each have 25 percent.


The second joint venture will operate some 750 service stations
and a network of terminals across Fujian province, according to
the statement.


Sinopec holds a 55 percent stake in the service station venture,
with Exxon Mobil and Saudi Aramco owning 22.5 percent each.


The partnership, which aims to meet China's rapidly growing
demand for petroleum products and petrochemicals, also includes a
long-term crude supply agreement with Saudi Aramco, the statement
said.


The three companies said the government had approved both joint
ventures.


Breakdown investments for each of the ventures were not provided.
