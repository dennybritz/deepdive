Pope Benedict XVI will receive US President George W. Bush in
June, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said on Saturday.


The audience will take place around the dates of a G8 summit in
Germany from June 6 to 8 which Bush is attending, he said.


"The meeting is planned as part of the American president's
journey to Europe in June, but no exact date has been fixed,"
Lombardi told AFP.
