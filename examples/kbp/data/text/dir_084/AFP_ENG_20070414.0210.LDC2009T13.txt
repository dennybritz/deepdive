German-US auto giant DaimlerChrysler only wants to sell off a
portion of its Chrysler subsidiary, a magazine reported.


German magazine Der Spiegel says in its issue to appear Monday
that chief executive Dieter Zetsche wants to dismantle Chrysler
and sell off the majority stake. Daimler would remain associated
to Chrysler, it said.


The magazine, which did not name its sources, reported that
Zetsche wants to sustain cooperation between DaimlerChrysler's
famed brand Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler.


The three most serious candidates to purchase Chrysler are
investment funds Blackstone and Cerberus, as well as Canadian
auto parts giant Magna International Inc., Der Spiegel said.


According to the magazine, all three have stressed that Chrysler
will remain dependent upon Mercedes-Benz even after the sale.


DaimlerChrysler announced on April 4 that it was in discussions
with "potential partners" for the purchase of Chrysler.
