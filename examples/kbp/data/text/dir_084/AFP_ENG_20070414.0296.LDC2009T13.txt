At least 20 people were killed and 40 others injured Saturday in
a road accident in northeastern Kenya, a medical official said.


The accident occured when a bus carrying at least 60 passengers
rolled over at Modo Gashi trading post, about 340 kilometres (210
miles) north of the capital Nairobi, Mustaf Abdullahi of the
Kenya Red Cross Society told AFP.


"A bus on the way from Nairobi to Wajir rolled off the road near
Modo Gashi and 20 people are confirmed dead and 40 are injured,"
Abdullahi said.


Medical officials were en route to the scene of the accident to
ferry the injured to Wajir District Hospital, about 150
kilometres (95 miles) away from Modo Gashi, he added.


Road accidents are frequent in the east African nation, home to
at least 32 million people, where traffic regulations are
routinely violated or ignored and road conditions often poor.
