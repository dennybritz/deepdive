An Italian animal rights group on Saturday asked Pope Benedict
XVI to stop wearing fur out of "respect for the sacredness" of
animals' lives.


The Italian Anti-Vivisection League said the pope should not wear
a fur hat the Vatican has ordered from a manufacturer in the
northern city of Pavia ahead of his visit to a university there
on April 22.


"Out of respect for the sacredness of the lives of all living
species, we invite the Holy Father to arrive at a choice of high
religious and ethical value by giving up fur clothing for that
occasion and for the future," the group's vice president, Roberto
Bennati, said in a statement.


Benedict XVI, who will celebrate his 80th birthday Monday,
regularly wears clothing with fur, particularly during outdoor
ceremonies in the winter.


The animal rights group argued that he should do without fur
because "valid alternatives exist that do not call for the murder
of animals."


Meanwhile, Vatican officials said Saturday that attendance for
events at Saint Peter's Square had declined compared to the first
year after the pope's election.


Since April last year, some 3.4 million people attended events at
Saint Peter's Square, compared to about four million for the
previous year since his election.


Then cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected pope on April 19,
2005.
