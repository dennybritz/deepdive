Direct foreign investment in Croatia rose to 2.8 billion euros
(3.8 billion dollars) in 2006, double the previous year's figure
and the highest level since statistics began in 1993, the central
bank said Saturday.


Accumulated foreign investment from 1993 to 2006 was 14.2 billion
euros.


Austria was the top foreign investor during that period, with 2.7
billion euros, followed by the Netherlands with 2.6 billion,
Germany with 2.2 billion and France with 1.1 billion euros.


The single most attractive sector for foreigners is Croatia's
banking industry, followed by the chemicals industry and
telecommunications.
