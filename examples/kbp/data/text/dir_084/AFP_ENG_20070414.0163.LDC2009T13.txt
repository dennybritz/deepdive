At least 20 people died Saturday when a flash food swept over a
popular waterfall in southern Thailand and many more are missing,
a hospital official and police said.


The tragedy took place at the Sairung waterfall in Trang
province, some 700 kilometers (434 miles) south of Bangkok, the
officials said.


"At least 20 people were confirmed dead and some 20 people were
missing," the hospital official said.


Police Major General Kachorn Siriwan in Trang province said at
least 14 people were missing.


"People were enjoying the waterfall and suddenly a flash flood
swept over," the police general said. No further details were
available.


Some 100 holidaymakers were at the waterfall as Thailand
celebrated the five-day Buddhist New Year holiday, which started
on Friday.
