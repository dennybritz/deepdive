Pope Benedict XVI will meet former Iranian president Mohammad
Khatami on May 4, a Vatican source said Saturday.


Details of the meeting were not disclosed, including what topics
the two would discuss.


Khatami was to meet with the pope last October but cancelled
after Benedict XVI gave a speech in Germany that was seen as
linking Islam with violence. The speech led to outrage in the
Muslim world.


ANSA news agency reported that Khatami plans to be in Italy
between May 3 and 11 and will meet privately with Prime Minister
Romano Prodi and Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema.


Khatami became known for his stormy and ultimately futile eight-
year battle to moderate Iran's hardline clerical regime.
