Police denied Saturday earlier reports that Russian opposition
leader Garry Kasparov had been released following his detention
at a banned opposition rally in Moscow, state-run RIA Novosti
news agency reported.


"He is still detained. I greeted him, as they say, just five
minutes ago at the station. Work with the investigators is
continuing," Moscow city police spokesman Viktor Biryukov was
quoted as saying.


Earlier, Interfax reported that Kasparov, a leader of The Other
Russia opposition coalition and a former world chess champion,
had been released, several hours after his detention.


Independent confirmation of Kasparov's status was not immediately
possible.
