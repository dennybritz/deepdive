Russian opposition leader Garry Kasparov said Saturday that he
had been taken to court following his detention at a banned
opposition rally in Moscow.


"I am with a group, with our lawyer and the group of some other
activists on the way to court," he told Britain's Sky television
by telephone.


"Right now I am in the police van. I think they are thoroughly
confused because so many people were arrested," said the former
chess champion turned opposition activist. "Many were arrested
and beaten."


Riot police detained as many as 200 demonstrators, including
Kasparov, in a crackdown on a banned protest in the centre of the
capital.
