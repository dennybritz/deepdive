The United States Saturday said North Korea must "immediately"
invite the UN nuclear watchdog to close down its Yongbyon nuclear
plant.


North Korea must "realize fully its commitments ... by inviting
back the IAEA immediately to begin shutting and sealing the
Yongbyon nuclear facility," US State Department spokesman Sean
McCormack said in a statement.


Saturday was the deadline for Yongbyon close the power plant
under a landmark six-nation accord.
