At least three women and five children drowned Saturday when a
boat sank in the Ganges river in the eastern Indian state of
Bihar, police said.


Ten others were reporting missing after the boat carrying some 50
pilgrims to a local Hindu holy site went down in the state's
Buxor district, a police spokesman said in state capital Patna.


The remaining passengers swam to safety, the spokesman said,
adding a search was on for the missing people.
