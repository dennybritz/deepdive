Italian dock workers went on a one-day strike Saturday to protest
safety conditions following a series of work-related deadly
accidents in the port of Genoa and other parts of the country.


Dock workers unions in a statement called for "effective security
measures and serious inspections so that they are applied."


A 40-year-old worker was killed on Friday at Genoa's port when he
was crushed by a two-tonne package that had fallen eight metres
(26 feet).


Three other people were killed in work-related accidents on the
same day, Italian media reported.


They included a 43-year-old labourer in an accident involving a
scraper in Milan, another labourer who fell from a scaffold near
Rome and a Moroccan immigrant killed in an explosion while
welding.


Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government pledged to
push for a new work security law in response to the accidents.


According to numbers from the National Insurance Institute for
Employment Injuries, 1,250 people were killed in such accidents
last year, compared to 1,255 in 2005.


An association for those suffering from work-related injuries
says there have been some 200,000 such deaths since 1950 and that
Italy's numbers are among the highest in Europe.


The group called for "immediate and concrete" actions to improve
work security.
