A US-based Gambian journalist who was arrested last month in
Banjul has been charged with treason and is being tried behind
closed doors, a judicial source said on Saturday.


Fatou Jaw Manneh's trial opened on April 12 in Kanifing, outside
the capital, and was being held in secret "in the interests of
witnesses and of the state", the source said on condition of
anonymity.


Manneh was charged on April 4 with planning to commit an act of
sedition, publishing seditious material and "publishing fake news
with the intention of provoking fear and alarm", the source said.
She faces three years in jail.


A columnist for Gambian news website All-Gambian.net and a strong
critic of President Yahya Jammeh, Manneh was arrested by the
intelligence services on March 28 at Banjul airport, sources
close to her family said.


She has been in political exile in the United States since 1994
and was only returning to Gambia for her father's funeral,
according to the International Federation of Journalists and the
Committee to Protect Journalists.


Manneh was most wanted for a 2005 article in which she accused
Jammeh of "reducing our dear country to tatters" and described
him as a "parcel of terror", according to Reporters Without
Borders.


In the last few years, the outcry against arrests, harrassment
and assassination of journalists in Gambia has increased.


Many human rights organisations consider the Gambian government
to be one of the most hostile towards press freedom.
