Less than a kilogram of explosives brought down the 125 tons ski
jump at Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday as a relic from the
Nazi era was demolished.


The old 40-metre high ski jump, built in 1934 for the 1936 Winter
Olympics held in the Bavarian market town, was destroyed to make
way for a new jumping facility set to be inaugurated for the 2008
Four Hills tournament.


Work on the new 10 million euro jump is set to begin next week
after the International Ski Federation (FIS) refused to re-
certify the old jump.


Just 800 grammes of high explosives was enough to bring the K-125
large hill jump, start tower and take-off platform crashing down.
