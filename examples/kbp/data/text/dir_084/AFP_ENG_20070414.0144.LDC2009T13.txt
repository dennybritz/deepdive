British soldiers in Iraq have killed eight people laying roadside
bombs near the southern city of Basra, the military reported on
Saturday.


Late on Friday, two roadside "bomb teams were hit by British
forces while they were in the process of laying their devices,"
the military said in a statement.


The incident occurred at around 10:40 pm (1840 GMT) on the
outskirts of Hyal Shuala district to the west of Basra, Iraq's
second largest city.


The military said the location of the "strike was close to where
two roadside bomb attacks took place last week."


On April 5 four British troops, including two women, and their
translator were killed when their patrol was hit by a combined
roadside bomb, small-arms and rocket-propelled grenade attack.


"It is not possible to directly link those killed last night with
last week's roadside bombs," Saturday's British military
statement said. "However, these militiamen were intent upon
launching exactly the same type of attack in the same area."
