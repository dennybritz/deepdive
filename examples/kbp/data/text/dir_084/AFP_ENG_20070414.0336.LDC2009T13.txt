Montenegro's police said on Saturday they had arrested two
Albanians trying to smuggle nine people into Italy.


The police did not give the names of the suspected traffickers,
who were arrested on Wednesday, but said they charged the
Albanian illegal immigrants 4,000 euros (5,400 dollars) each for
the trip.


On Wednesday, police found 21 illegal immigrants near Kruce, who
were trying to get to Italy by boat.


Engine failure had apparently forced their traffickers to berth
in the town, where they abandoned the immigrants. They then took
the boat to the town of Bar, where it was found by police.


Montenegro, like the other Balkan countries, is a transit point
for human traffickers going into the European Union.
