Residents of a Guinean region stricken by political violence in
January and February on Saturday appealed for help for about 100
families whose homes were burnt down by army soldiers.


"On February 17, soldiers based in this town voluntarily set fire
to 96 huts in the Haifa neighbourhood" during protests against
President Lansana Conte, said Mamoudou Sane, president of the
Gaoual development association.


"Since then, about 100 families have found themselves in a
critical situation," he told a press conference in Conakry,
warning of the "extreme urgency" of getting help before the rainy
season began in mid-May.


"We need tents and blankets, food and seeds, because everything
was taken away by the flames during the fires," Sane said.


In a separate press conference on Saturday in Conakry, the GOHA
Group of Businessmen also called for help for the people of
Gaoual, which lies 400 kilometres (250 miles) north of the
capital.


GOHA has been carrying out a census of the victims of the
repression carried out during January and February, and Chairman
Cherif Abdallah said it had already recorded damages worth
"hundreds of millions of dollars".


Between January 10 and the end of February, a crackdown on trade-
union organised protests against the Guinean government left at
least 113 dead and prompted Conte to impose martial law.


The violence ended after Conte appointed consensus candidate
Lansana Kouyate as the new prime minister, replacing his initial
choice of Eugene Camara.
