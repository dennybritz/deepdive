Sri Lanka qualified for the World Cup semi-finals on Saturday
without having to take to the field.


Their place in the last four was confirmed when New Zealand beat
South Africa by five wickets here.


Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka are definitely through with
either South Africa or England, who meet in Barbados on Tuesday,
likely to fill the fourth slot.
