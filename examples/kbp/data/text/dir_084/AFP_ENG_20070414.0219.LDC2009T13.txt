Brazilian Rubens Barrichello and Briton Jenson Button were again
downbeat following another disappointing qualifying session in
Bahrain ahead of Sunday's race.


Barrichello was 15th in qualifying one place ahead of his British
teammate and insisted the blame for the poor showing is solely
with the car manufacturers and not the drivers, who had been
expected to challenge for race victories this season


"This morning I had a few problems with the aerodynamic set-up of
the car but this improved a little for qualifying," said
Barrichello.


"The qualifying session itself was straightforward enough, but I
am getting the most from the car as it is right now and
unfortunately that is 15th position. As always we will be looking
for any possibilities to improve during the race."


Button, who saw his engine explode in Friday's afternoon practice
session was as equally downbeat as his Latin American teammate.


"We've qualified roughly where we have done for the past two
races, and as we have acknowledged, that is as quick as the car
goes right now.


"In Q1 I had a problem with the front wing. My first option
(soft) tyre run was quite good and then during the next run on
the option we lost masses of front downforce and at every corner
I was locking up the fronts.


"I kept moving further rearwards on the brake bias but it didn't
really help. In Q2 we tried a different front wing but it didn't
improve things.


"I think we got the best from the car again today so it's down to
what we can do in the race now."
