An alliance of Sunni groups headed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq said in an
Internet statement on Saturday it had kidnapped 20 Iraqi soldiers
and policemen and threatened to kill them in 48 hours if its
demands were not met.


The self-styled Islamic State of Iraq posted still images showing
the purported captives dressed in brown and blue uniforms,
blindfolded and handcuffed.


It demanded the release of "Muslim Sunni sisters who are in the
prisons of the interior" ministry, in the statement posted on a
website used by Islamist militant groups.


"The Islamic State of Iraq gives the government of (Prime
Minister Nuri) al- Maliki 48 hours to meet its demands or it will
execute the rule of God on them," it said.
