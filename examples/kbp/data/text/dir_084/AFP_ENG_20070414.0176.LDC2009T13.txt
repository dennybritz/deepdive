Moroccan security services on Saturday arrested the man thought
to be the head of the group responsible for deadly explosions in
the city this week and a month ago.


The man, along with his deputy, were arrested on Saturday morning
in the shantytown of Sidi Moumen, on the outskirts of Casablanca,
in the course of police investigations into Tuesday's explosions
and that of March 11 in which a total of five people died.


Police said they had discovered where the gang were making their
explosives and had also been able to identify the rest of the
group and were actively looking for them.


On Tuesday three men blew themselves up in Casablanca as they
were pursued by police during its hunt for those behind the March
explosion. A fourth man linked to the group died of injuries he
sustained in the police operation.


One man died in the March explosion.


He was the brothers of one of those who died on Tuesday and was
thought to have set off his explosives accidentally. Three others
were wounded in the blast in a Casablanca Internet cafe.


Earlier Saturday, two men blew themselves up outside a US
cultural centre in Casablanca. It was not yet clear if the pair
were linked to the March 11 group.
