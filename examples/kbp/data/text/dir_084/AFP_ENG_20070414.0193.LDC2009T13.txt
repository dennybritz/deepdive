British bookmakers were taking bets Saturday on who Prince
William will marry following his reported split from girlfriend
Kate Middleton, with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton among the
front runners.


Bookmakers William Hill were offering odds of 6-1 that the prince
would tie the knot with a fellow army officer; 8-1 on Tara
Palmer-Tompkinson, a British socialite and friend of the family;
14-1 on fellow party girl Hilton, the US hotel chain heiress, and
20-1 on wayward singer Spears.


William, 24, second in line to the throne, was reported to have
been exchanging emails with Spears in 2002.


Other potential queens quoted included US singer Kelly Osbourne
and Paul McCartney's estranged wife Heather Mills, both at 100-1.


William's brother Prince Harry, 22, was tipped to beat him to
getting down on one knee. William Hill said Harry was the 1-2
favourite to get engaged first.


They offered odds of 2-1 that William would get engaged between
the ages of 28 and 30, and 20-1 that he would become king as a
single man.


They said they had expected to pay out over 50,000 pounds (75,000
euros, 100,000 dollars) if William married Middleton.


But British media reported Saturday that the love affair was
over.


"We are as shocked as everyone else, if rather more relieved than
most as we were preparing to pay out over 50,000 pounds to
punters who had backed the couple to wed," said William Hill
spokesman Rupert Adams.
