Canadian Paul Tracy was hospitalized with a fractured vertebrae
after a crash in practice Saturday for the Champ Car Grand Prix
of Long Beach.


Tracy, whose triumph in the series in 2003 marked the last time a
driver other than France's Sebastian Bourdais claimed the Champ
Car crown, was coming off a third-place finish in the opening
race of the season at Las Vegas last Sunday.


He was fifth-fastest in the first qualifying session on Friday.


But Tracy crashed into the turn one wall in the morning practice
session and was taken to hospital after experiencing back pain.


X-rays and MRI examinations confirmed a compression fracture to
his first lumbar vertebrae.


His team, Forsythe Racing, said he would miss the remainder of
the weekend and it wasn't yet known when he would be able to
return to racing.


Tracy will be replaced in the Forsythe Championship Racing 3
entry by 2005 Champ Car World Series runner-up Oriol Servia of
Spain.
