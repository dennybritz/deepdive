Fistfights broke out Saturday in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek
during a peaceful rally by about 5,000 opposition activists
against what they said was bias by state-run media.


The crowd was returning from a march to the headquarters of state
radio and television when 20-30 men in plainclothes arrived in
police cars and launched an attack, provoking a brawl involving
stones and bottles, an AFP correspondent saw.


Several people were injured.


Most of the assailants escaped, but three were grabbed and beaten
by the crowd, two of them losing consciousness.


The demonstrators were protesting what they said was the state
broadcaster's bias in favour of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev.


Crowds gathered throughout last week in the centre of Bishkek
calling for Bakiyev's ouster, although a series of political
concessions to the opposition appear to have defused any serious
threat to his rule.


Bakiyev has faced opposition in parliament and on the streets
since he came to power in 2005 after a violent uprising that
drove out former veteran president Askar Akayev.
