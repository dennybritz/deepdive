At least 23 people died Saturday and many more were missing after
a flash flood swept over a popular waterfall in southern
Thailand, officials said.


The tragedy took place at about 2:00 pm (0700 GMT) at the Sairung
waterfall in Trang province, some 700 kilometres (434 miles)
south of Bangkok.


"At least 23 people were confirmed dead and we have learned that
more bodies are coming," a local hospital official said, adding
that she did not know how many people were missing.


Most of the victims were women and children, she said.


A senior provincial official said 23 people were killed and at
least 24 were missing several hours after the accident, while
police major general Kachorn Siriwan, in Trang province, said
earlier at least 14 people were still missing.


"People were enjoying the waterfall and suddenly a flash flood
swept over," the police officer said.


The Nation English language daily said on its website that
tourists at the waterfall were caught off-guard by the flood and
many failed to "get out of the waterways in time."


Several injured tourists were stranded on rocks and trees waiting
for rescue workers, the Nation said.


Local reports also said the area had been hit by heavy rains
since Thursday.


Following the incident, hundreds of rescue workers, including
military personnel, local police and volunteers, were mobilised
to hunt for the missing and to help survivors, the senior
provincial official said.


"We are continuing our search and rescue operations," he said.


Around 100 holidaymakers were enjoying the waterfall at the time
of the tragedy, according to the local hospital official.


Thailand is celebrating the five-day Buddhist New Year holiday,
which started on Friday.
