Japan's leading professional cyclist Fumiyuki Beppu could make
history on Sunday by becoming the first rider from his country to
race over the cobblestones of the famed Paris-Roubaix race.


Japanese rider Masahiro Shinagawa, who is part of the Skil-
Shimano team, started the 259km one-day epic here last year but
pulled out early.


Beppu, who rides for the Discovery Channel team, will be hoping
to both start and finish the race which features 28 sections of
bone-rattling cobblestones totalling nearly 53km.


The 23-yar-old Beppu is one of several Asian riders trying to
make an impact in the tough European cycling scene.


He came to the professional ranks through Marseille based amateur
club VC La Pomme - an under-23 outfit where Ireland's Mark
Scanlon and Nicolas Roche rode before becoming professional.


Shinagawa will also start the race here on Sunday but Chinese
teammate Fang Xu has not been selected for the team.
