New Zealand won the toss and sent South Africa in to bat in their
World Cup Super Eights match at the Grenada National Stadium
Saturday.


The sky was overcast and light early morning showers meant the
covers were only removed shortly before the toss.


Both countries made one change from the teams that played in
previous matches at the stadium.


Left-arm spinner Robin Peterson came into the South African side
for batsman Loots Bosman.


South Africa beat West Indies by 67 runs Tuesday.


New Zealand added offspinner Jeetan Patel in place of pace bowler
Mark Gillespie from the side beaten by six wickets by Sri Lanka
Thursday.


New Zealand have eight points with South Africa on six points.


New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Peter Fulton, Ross
Taylor, Scott Styris, Craig McMillan, Jacob Oram, Brendon
McCullum, Daniel Vettori, James Franklin, Jeetan Patel, Shane
Bond.
