A conservative German politician whose defence of his
predecessor's Nazi past provoked criticism from Chancellor Angela
Merkel said on Saturday that he "regretted" his comments.


Guenther Oettinger, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats
(CDU), said in an "open letter to those who criticised me" that
he had not intended to appear to "in any way put into perspective
the terrible Nazi dictatorship."


"In so far as the comments led to misunderstandings, I formally
regret them," said the leader of the southwestern Baden-
Wuerttemberg regional government.


Oettinger caused outrage by remarks made during a eulogy for Hans
Filbinger, a former CDU leader of Baden-Wuerttemberg and a navy
judge under the Third Reich, whom he described as an "opponent of
the Nazi regime."


Filbinger, who died aged 93 on April 1, had resigned as state
leader in 1978 following revelations about his involvement while
a judge in death sentences against deserters in World War II. He
never expressed regret about his past.


Oettinger's comments, made on Wednesday, were condemned across
Germany and by the Simon-Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, which
called for his resignation.


On Friday, Merkel announced publicly that she had called
Oettinger to tell him that she wished "that beyond honouring the
great life's work of premier Hans Filbinger, critical questions
about the Nazi era had also been posed."
