Thousands of Spanish farmers marched through the streets of
Madrid on Saturday to demand higher prices for their produce and
protest against the European Union's common agricultural policy.


More than 25,000 people from across the country took part in the
protest, one of the organizers of the event, the Spanish
association of young farmers (ASAJA), said in a statement.


The demonstration was called to "demand that the government find
solutions to the deep crisis which the sector is facing,
especially for fruit, vegetables and wine growers, given the
ruinous prices that are paid," the statement said.


The price paid to farmers for oranges has been halved between
1994 and 2007 while the cost of gasoline during the same period
has doubled, the association said as an example.


"In the countryside we spend two but charge one. What is left?
Ruin," and "Farmer don't sell your product without a fair price,"
were some of the banners on display.


The protestors said they want EU agricultural subsidies to be
increased and be paid directly to farmers.


The EU awards billions of euros each year in subsidies aimed at
agricultural support and rural development as part of its common
agricultural policy.


But since 2003 these subsidies have increasingly been decoupled
from farm production levels and made dependent on indicators such
as animal welfare and environmental protection.
