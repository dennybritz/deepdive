An airplane carrying Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade and 12 of
his ministers made an emergency landing in Spain on Saturday
because of a problem with a cockpit window, officials said.


The Boeing 727 returned to Palma on the Mediterranean island of
Majorca, where it had made a stopover while on its way to Dubai
from Paris, after the pilot detected the problem, a spokesman for
airport authority AENA said.


The private plane was carrying 46 passengers including the
president and his 12 cabinet ministers as well as eight crew
members, Senegalese government officials told the Spanish news
agency Europa Press in Dakar.


The president and his entourage resumed their trip to Dubai on
another airplane which arrived several hours later from
Casablanca in Morocco, the officials and the AENA spokesman said.
