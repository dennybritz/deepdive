A suicide car bomb killed at least 34 people and wounded dozens
more in a shopping area near the Imam Hussein shrine in Iraq's
Shiite holy city of Karbala on Saturday, the local governor said.


"Thirty-four people were killed and dozens wounded, 12 of them
seriously," Akhil Khazali told state television, revising
downward an earlier death toll of 47 provided by an Iraqi army
source.


Local security spokesman Rahman Mushawi earlier said that 40
people were killed in the blast outside a bus station, car park
and market stall complex.


Khazali said that an indefinite vehicle curfew was declared in
the city after the bomb attack, which he said occurred near a
checkpoint near the shopping area.


"This explosion was well planned as the bomber was targeting a
densely populated area," Khazali said.


Earlier on Saturday, a medic from the local hospital said many of
the victims were women and children, and four of the wounded were
Iranian pilgrims.


He said that the bomb exploded at a bus station which is
surrounded by many shops.


A security official earlier said that the blast ripped through
the shopping area at around 9:15 am (0515 GMT) about 200 metres
(yards) from the revered Imam Hussein shrine.
