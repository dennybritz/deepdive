Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is to meet her Jordanian
counterpart for talks in Amman on Sunday, an Israeli government
source said on Saturday.


Livni's talks with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib
will come ahead of Jordan's King Abdullah II meeting with Israeli
parliament speaker Dalia Yitzik on Thursday.


Abdullah is also due to meet Palestinian and US peace activists
amid efforts to relaunch Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.


A palace source said that Yitzik will visit Jordan on April 19
for talks on reviving the peace process.


She will be preceded to Amman by separate non-government
Palestinian and US peace activists on Monday and Tuesday
respectively, the palace official said.


The visits are part of efforts by Jordan to move forward the
peace process and raise support for an Arab peace initiative
adopted by Arab leaders at a summit in Saudi Arabia at the end of
March.
