Irish horse Silver Birch won the Grand National here on Saturday
to give Ireland their fifth winner in the last nine runnings.


The 10-year-old ridden by Robbie Power - the son of a legendary
Irish show jumper Con - and trained by Gordon Elliott beat home
McKelvey while Slim Pickings was third.


The winner - a former favourite for the race in 2005 but who lost
form and was sold by English trainer Paul Nicholls - travelled
smoothly throughout and came to the fore late in the second
circuit after Naunton Brook and Ballycassidy had set the pace on
the first circuit.


Though headed coming to the last by Slim Pickings, Power got his
nose in front over the fence and despite a brave resurgence by
both Slim Pickings and McKelvey the winner just had enough to
hold on to win at 33/1.
