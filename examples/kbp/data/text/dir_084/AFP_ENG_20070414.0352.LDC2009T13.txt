New Zealand were 66-2 after 20 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against South Africa at the Grenada National Stadium
chasing 194 to win and book their place in the semi-finals.


Captain Stephen Fleming was on 23 with Scott Styris on 14.


Peter Fulton was the first man out caught by Andrew Hall in the
slips off Makhaya Ntini for 16 with the total on 25 in the eighth
over.


Ross Taylor then fell lbw to Andre Nel for 10 in the 13th over
with the total having moved on to 42.


Earlier, the Black Caps bounced back from their defeat against
Sri Lanka by restricting South Africa to 193 for seven off 50
overs.


New Zealand took full advantage of winning the toss and sending
the Proteas  in to bat on an overcast day in conditions which
helped their seam bowlers.


South Africa lost their first two wickets for three runs, and
never recovered despite a restrained innings of 60 by Herschelle
Gibbs, who shared stands of 49 with Jacques Kallis (22) and 76
with Ashwell Prince (37).


The tone was set by New Zealand opening bowlers James Franklin
and Shane Bond, who both took an early wicket and were mainly
responsible for South Africa scoring only 13 runs in the first 12
overs.


Bond finished with two for 26 in ten overs, while left-armer
Franklin took one for 16 in seven.


Medium-pacer Craig McMillan was the most successful bowler,
however, taking three for 23.
