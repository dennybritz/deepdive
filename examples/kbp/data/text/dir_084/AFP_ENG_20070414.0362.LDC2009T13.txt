Pro Tour cycling team Unibet.com took another knock after Belgian
betting commission officials decreed the Belgian-Swedish team has
infringed the country's laws.


Unibet.com took part in two races in the country despite Belgium
having similar laws to France against betting sponsorship.


"Unibet organises games of chance for which it has no
authorisation to do so in Belgium and it is targeting a new
client-base for it's games by illegal publicising, notably
through the sponsorship of a cycling team," said the commission.


Unibet.com received a Pro Tour licence in the close season but
has been hit by bans from several major races this season,
despite Pro Tour rules dictating that every one of its 20 teams
must be invited to take part in Pro Tour races.


ASO, the organisers of the Tour de France as well as many stage
and classic races in France and Belgium, has used the French laws
against betting sponsorship as an excuse not to invite the team
to its races, even though Unibet.com said it would not wear the
Unibet.com logo when racing in the country.


But this latest news will be a blow as Unibet.com may now find
itself barred from racing in Belgium as well.
