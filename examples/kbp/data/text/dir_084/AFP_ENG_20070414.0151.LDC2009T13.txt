NATO forces stepped up their hunt for Bosnian Serb war crimes
suspect Stojan Zupljanin Saturday with raids on houses owned by a
cousin and prominent businessman, police said.


Zupljanin's family home in Banja Luka and a house belonging to
Mara Stojisavljevic, a cousin of Zupljanin's wife, were searched
on Friday by Bosnian Serb police and NATO troops.


Saturday's raids targeted property in Banja Luka owned by
Slobodan Zupljanin, head of the local chamber of commerce, who is
suspected of aiding his fugitive cousin.


As in Friday's operation, a quantity of documents were seized
which it was hoped would help lead to Stojan Zulpjanin, police
spokeswoman Tamara Despenic said.


Zupljanin, 56, has been on the run from the UN's International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) since 1999.


He was originally charged with genocide, but his indictment was
later amended and he is now wanted on charges of crimes against
humanity and violations of customs of war.


Bosnian Serb police have targeted his relatives in raids over the
past few months on suspicion that they have provided him with
financial and other assistance.


Although Bosnia's war ended more than a decade ago, The Hague-
based ICTY is still searching for six war crimes suspects,
notably Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his army
chief Ratko Mladic.


Bosnia's war claimed some 200,000 lives and left the Balkans
country split into two semi-independent entities -- the Serbs'
Republika Srpska and the Muslim- Croat Federation.
