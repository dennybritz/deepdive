Chadian Foreign Minister Ahmat Allami arrived in Khartoum on
Saturday for talks on deadly border clashes between Sudanese and
Chadian soldiers earlier in the week, said the official SUNA news
agency.


Allami is carrying a message from Chadian President Driss Deby
Itno for his Sudanese counterpart, added SUNA.


Relations between the two countries nosedived after the April 9
clashes which the Sudanese said killed 17 of their soldiers and
the Chadians say killed 30 overall.


Some Sudanese officials threatened retaliation, but others also
hinted that they had accepted a Chadian apology.


Libya sent its number two diplomat Abdel Salam Triki to both
capitals in a bid to ease tensions, obtaining a commitment on
Thursday from Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir to maintain good
relations with the neighbouring country.


Chad has apologised for the cross-border action of its forces,
explaining that it was not deliberate and that they were in hot
pursuit of rebels who had just attacked several Chadian villages.


Sudan and Chad accuse each other of supporting rebel forces in
their respective territories amid international fears that the
continuing strife in Sudan's western Darfur region will spill
over into Chad and ignite a regional war.
