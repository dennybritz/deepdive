Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas will meet his Swiss
counterpart, Micheline Calmy-Rey, in Geneva on April 26 as part
of a tour of European states, a spokesman for the Swiss foreign
ministry said on Saturday.


The Palestinian foreign minister Ziad Abou Amr will also attend
the meeting, the spokesman added.


A Palestinian official said on Friday that Abbas would visit
France, Poland, Sweden, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and Switzerland
during his European trip that starts on April 17.


Abbas is aiming to convince the European Union to lift its
sanctions against the Palestinian government, which is led by the
Islamist Hamas movement.


Hamas is classified as a terrorist organisation by the European
Union and the United States.
