Former US national goalkeeper Kasey Keller will miss the rest of
the season for Bundesliga bottom club Borussia Moenchengladbach
after picking up an injury on Friday night.


Former Tottenham Hotspurs keeper Keller, 37, picked up a thigh
injury in the dying stages of Moenchengladbach's 1-0 defeat by
Hamburg, which looks almost certain to have condemned his side to
relegation.


Keller, who won 96 caps for the US, will miss the next four weeks
and is out of contract at the end of the season. He has been at
'Gladbach since 2004.
