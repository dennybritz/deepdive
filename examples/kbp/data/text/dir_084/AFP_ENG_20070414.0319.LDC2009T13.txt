The Moroccan police have seized 7.5 tonnes of hashish in the port
of Casablanca from a container destined for Ireland, an official
in Rabat said on Saturday.


The hashish, a resin taken from cannabis, was hidden in a crate
of hand-crafted tiles stamped with the name of an import-export
company based in Fez, east of Rabat, the same source said.


Police found the drugs after scanning a container holding 1,506
cases of the suspect tiles, and arrested a woman working for the
company, it added.


The forwarding agent said to have approved the declaration from
the company was interviewed before being let go, the source said.
