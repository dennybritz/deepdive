A Syrian man who was arrested after crossing onto the Israeli
occupied side of the Golan Heights has been sent back to Syrian
held territory, an Israeli security source said on Saturday.


The 24-year-old man was sent back to his country with the help of
the International Committee of the Red Cross, the source said.


He had reportedly said that he was sick and seeking medical help
when on Friday he crossed onto the the Israeli side of the
territory annexed in 1981 by the Jewish state.


Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have been frozen
since 2000. Damascus demands the return of the Golan which was
seized by Israel in 1967 and later annexed.


More than 15,000 Israelis have settled there.
