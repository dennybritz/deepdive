Conflicting reports emerged Saturday over the whereabouts of
Garry Kasparov, with police denying an earlier report that the
opposition leader had been released after his detention at a
banned opposition rally in Moscow.


"Currently investigators are working with Kasparov," an unnamed
police representative was quoted as saying by Interfax. Kasparov
was being held at a station in western Moscow, the spokesman
said.


Earlier, Interfax's correspondent reported seeing Kasparov, a
leader of The Other Russia opposition coalition and a former
world chess champion, leave a police station, several hours after
his detention.


Independent confirmation of Kasparov's status was not immediately
possible.
