Egypt's opposition Muslim Brotherhood said on Saturday it will
field 20 candidates in upcoming elections for parliament's upper
house, despite a new constitutional ban on religious-based
political activity.


"The Muslim Brotherhood will compete in the upcoming Shura
Council elections set for next June with not more than 20
candidates," deputy leader Mohammed Habib said in a statement.


June's elections will be for a third of the 266 seats in
parliament's upper body, which is largely restricted to issuing
non-binding recommendations about new legislation.


The Brotherhoood won 88 seats, or about a fifth, in the 2005
elections for the more powerful lower body, making it the largest
single opposition force in the country by far, even though its
members were forced to run as independents.


The grouping's ability to take part in the Shura Council
elections remains in doubt, however, in the wake of the approval
of a series of constitutional amendments in March that
specifically prohibit political activity on a religious basis.


Brotherhood candidates contest elections under the slogan "Islam
is the solution."


"We insist on participating and we are ready for any problems or
trouble," the organisation's spokesman Issam al-Arian told AFP.
"They cannot simply ban candidates because that would destroy the
process."
