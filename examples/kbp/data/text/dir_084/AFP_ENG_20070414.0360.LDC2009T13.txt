The United States on Saturday urged North Korea to "immediately"
invite the UN nuclear watchdog in order begin closing down its
Yongbyon nuclear plant as a key deadline in the negotiations
passed.


North Korea must "realize fully its commitments ... by inviting
back the International Atomic Energy Agency immediately to begin
shutting and sealing the Yongbyon nuclear facility," US State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a statement.


Saturday was the deadline for North Korea to start shutting down
its Yongbyon nuclear reactor and admit UN atomic inspectors as
required under the first deadline of the February 13 aid-for-
disarmament deal.


An IAEA invitation would "enable the other parties to follow
through with the provision of emergency energy assistance
equivalent to 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and move the
six-party process forward," it said.


McCormack said Washington and its negotiating partners "remain
firmly committed to prompt completion of the initial action plan
and to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."


Progress on the disarmament agreement, reached after years of
six-nation talks, has been held up by Pyongyang's refusal to move
before the release of some 25 million dollars of North Korean
funds frozen in a Macau bank due to US sanctions.
