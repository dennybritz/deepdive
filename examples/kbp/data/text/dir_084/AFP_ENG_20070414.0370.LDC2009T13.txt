Russian opposition leader and former chess champion Garry
Kasparov, arrested on Saturday for participating in a banned
demonstration against President Vladimir Putin, was fined 40
dollars and then set free, a spokesman for his party said.


Kasparov had been arrested along with as many as 200 others in a
crackdown on the banned protest in central Moscow.


He "was freed and fined 1,000 rubles (40 dollars, 29.5 euros),"
spokesman Denis Bilunov told AFP.


Kasparov was held in a police station for five hours and then
taken to a court which fined him for "shouting anti-government
slogans", his lawyer, Karinna Moskalenko, told the Ria-Novosti
news agency.


Earlier, thousands of riot police and interior ministry soldiers
in camouflage battledress flooded the city centre to prevent a
march by The Other Russia, a coalition of groups that accuse
Putin of dismantling democracy.


Kasparov, one of the leaders of The Other Russia, was detained as
he attempted to lead demonstrators on to the historic Pushkin
Square.
