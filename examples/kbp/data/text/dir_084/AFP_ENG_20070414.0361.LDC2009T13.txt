Defending champion Nicolas Almagro defeated fellow Spaniard
Santiago Ventura 6-7 (6/8), 6-4, 6-4 to reach the final of the
353,450-euro Valencia Open here on Saturday.


Third-seeded Almagro, who is ranked 33rd in the world, will face
Italy's Potito Starace in Sunday's final.


The Italian also had to fight back from being one set down
against Spain's Ivan Navarro Pastor but eventually triumphed 6-7
(2/7), 6-0, 7-5 in the other semi- final, with both matches
delayed by rain.


"It was a very difficult but beautiful match. We both played to
our limits and we could both have won," said Almagro, who hit 16
aces and converted three of four break point opportunities.


"I hope to be able to play the same way at the final as I have
all week. The truth is things have come out better than I
expected. If I don't win I will leave pleased all the same,"
added the 21-year-old Almagro.


Almagro is heading into his first ATP final since capturing his
debut title at the same event last year.


He now has a winning streak of nine matches at the tournament and
will be looking to replicate his second round victory over
Starace at the Sony Ericsson Open, an ATP Masters Series event in
Miami, last month.


The pair are tied 1-1 in career meetings. Play had been scheduled
to start at 12:30pm, but rain delayed both semi-finals for nearly
three hours. Only 12 minutes of play was managed before another
hour's delay to both matches.
