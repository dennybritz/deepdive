Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi will begin a six-
day visit to Africa in the Sudan, officials said Saturday.


Abdullah will meet Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir on Monday to
discuss issues of mutual interest including trade and investment
to strengthen bilateral ties, a statement from the foreign
ministry said.


"Other regional and international issues such as the Middle East
are expected to feature in the discussions as well," it said.


Abdullah is also scheduled to visit Kenya on April 18 and Namibia
on April 20-21 and will meet leaders of both countries to discuss
political developments in Africa.


International rights group Amnesty International Malaysia (AIM)
on Saturday called on Abdullah to raise the issue of human rights
violations and the ongoing tragedy of Darfur during his meeting
in the Sudan.


The group said Abdullah, as current chairman of the Organisation
of the Islamic Conference "has an obligatory responsibility" to
call on the Sudanese government to cease international human
rights and humanitarian law violations.


"Otherwise... we will fail in our duty as a member of the
international and Islamic community with cost to human lives,"
AIM said.


Violence has steadily escalated in Darfur since conflict erupted
in 2003. The United Nations estimates that at least 200,000
people have been killed.
