An Indian soldier guarding a key airport in insurgency-torn
Kashmir shot dead his boss Saturday in the high-security complex
following a quarrel, officials said.


The soldier, who was not identified by police, allegedly used his
service rifle to shoot commandant Nagal Singh at the airport in
Jammu, Kashmir's winter capital. Police overpowered the suspect
after the incident and arrested him.


"The man shot Singh following a verbal altercation," an airport
spokesman said, without elaborating.


Hundreds of soldiers guard civilian and military airports in
Kashmir to prevent attacks by Islamic guerrillas who have waged a
bloody anti-Indian rebellion in the disputed Himalayan region
since 1989.


Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full, but each rules
part of it.


India attributes the growing number of cases in which soldiers
turn their guns on their commanders to harsh working conditions
and combat stress in Kashmir, where more than 44,000 people have
been killed in the past 18 years.
