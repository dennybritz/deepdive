Pope Benedict XVI will receive US President George W. Bush in
June, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said on Saturday.


The audience will take place around the dates of a G8 summit in
Germany from June 6 to 8 which Bush is attending, he said.


"The meeting is planned as part of the American president's
journey to Europe in June, but no exact date has been fixed,"
Lombardi told AFP.


Bush, a member of the Methodist Church, became the first US
president to attend a pope's funeral when John Paul II died in
April 2005.


He has not been received in the Vatican in the two years since,
but his wife Laura was granted a private audience by Benedict in
February 2006.


In his Easter blessing last Sunday Benedict said that "nothing
positive comes from Iraq."


The country is "torn apart by continual slaughter as the civilian
population flees," the pope said in his traditional "Urbi et
Orbi" (to the city and the world) blessing from the loggia of St
Peter's Basilica.


The pope speaks rarely about the situation in Iraq, where attacks
continue in and around Baghdad despite a massive security
operation since February 14 to quell daily bloodshed in the Iraqi
capital that has left thousands dead in the last year alone.


The late John Paul II was a firm opponent of the Iraq war.


The US population of 300 million is mostly protestant, but
Catholics form a large minority with 65 million followers.
