Chadian Foreign Minister Ahmat Allami was expected in Khartoum on
Saturday for talks on the deadly border clashes between Sudanese
and Chad soldiers on Monday, a Sudanese official said.


"The delegation led by Allami is expected today," the foreign
ministry spokesman told AFP on Saturday, without elaborating.


Relations between the two countries mosedived after the April 9
clashes which the Sudanese said killed 17 of their soldiers and
the Chadians say killed 30 overall.


Some Sudanese officials threatened retaliation, but others also
hinted that they had accepted a Chadian apology.


Libya sent its number two diplomat Abdel Salam Triki to both
capitals in a bid to ease tensions, obtaining a commitment on
Thursday from Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir to maintain good
relations between the neighbouring countries.


Chad has apologised for the cross-border action of its forces,
explaining that it was not deliberate and that they were in hot
pursuit of rebels who had just attacked several Chadian villages.


Sudan and Chad accuse each other of supporting rebel forces in
their respective territories amid international fears that the
ongoing strife in Sudan's western Darfur region will spill over
into Chad and ignite a regional war.
