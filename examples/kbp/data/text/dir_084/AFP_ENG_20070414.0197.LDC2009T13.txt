A teenage spectator was bludgeoned to death by a cricketer during
a local match near the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, police and
witnesses said Saturday.


Rabinath Ash, 17, was battered to death with a stump when he
tried to shield his younger brother from attack Friday at a
cricket ground in a suburb of Kolkata, they said.


"A scuffle broke when the batting side on the verge of winning
the match insisted on carrying on with the game despite fading
daylight," police inspector general Raj Kanojia said.


"The opponents started beating Somnath, the victim's younger
brother, who was batting and had totalled a good score," he said.


During the quarrel, fielder Ram Patra allegedly picked up a stump
and hit Ash on the head, which led to his death, the officer
said.


Ash was at the ground as a spectator, witnesses said.


Kanojia said the 19-year-old alleged killer had been arrested.
