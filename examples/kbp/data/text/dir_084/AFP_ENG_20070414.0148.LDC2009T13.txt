The confusion surrounding the first round of voting in East
Timor's presidential election mounted Saturday when the election
commission said a district with 100,000 eligible voters had
produced three times as many votes.


Martinho Gusmao, spokesman for the national election commission,
could not explain the discrepancy, which emerged amid growing
questions about East Timor's first presidential poll since
independence in 2002.


"It registered a little more than 100,000 but the result is more
than 300,000," he said of Bacau, East Timor's second town.


The surplus 200,000 would represent a huge proportion of the
total vote -- East Timor has just 520,000 eligible voters.


"The commissioners will discuss it together in order to find out
how this illogical situation happened in Bacau."


Gusmao refused to say whether the new discovery could invalidate
the provisional results, in which Jose Ramos-Horta, East Timor's
current prime minister, and Francisco "Lu-Olo" Guterres, the
ruling Fretilin party's candidate, emerged to contest the run-
off.


The commission said Friday that serious flaws in the election
could force some areas to repeat first-round voting.


Most of the candidates who stood formally demanded a recount,
even though international observers said the poll in the former
Portuguese colony was generally orderly and peaceful.


The commission rejected their demand on Thursday, saying there
was no legal basis on which to grant the request.


A number of the candidates also raised the possibility that
voters were intimidated, stoking fears of instability in the
troubled state ahead of the second round.
