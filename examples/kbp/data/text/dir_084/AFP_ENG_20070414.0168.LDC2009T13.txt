At least 15 people were killed and nine others injured Saturday
when a bus skidded off a mountain road in northern Pakistan,
officials said.


The bus plunged into a deep ravine in Sazin valley, 60 kilometers
(38 miles) southwest of Gilgit, local official Abdul Hameed said.


"Nine passengers were killed on the spot while six others died in
the hospital," local official Abdul Hameed said, adding the
condition of the nine injured passengers was stable.


Pakistan has the world's third-highest death rate from road
accidents. Vehicles are often overloaded and poorly maintained,
while many roads are treacherous.
