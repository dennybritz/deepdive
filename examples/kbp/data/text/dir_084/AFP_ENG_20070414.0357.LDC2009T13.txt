Argentine football idol Diego Maradona is stable and is to remain
under hospital observation a day after being admitted for severe
abdominal pain, the hospital treating him said Saturday.


"Twenty-four hours after his hospitalization, Diego Maradona no
longer exhibits the symptoms which led to his admittance," the
Los Arcos clinic said in a statement, adding he was "clinically
stable."


However the famed footballer's "hospitalization will continue so
that doctors can manage and monitor his progress," it said.


The 46-year-old was rushed to emergency Friday, just two days
after being discharged from a different facility after 13 days of
treatment for excessive drinking which sparked a return of the
chronic hepatitis he has suffered for years.


The statement said Maradona's case was being managed by a "multi-
disciplinary team of psychiatric, liver and obesity surgery
specialists who will determine the future course of treatment."


The hospital said it would release information about Maradona's
health "that has been approved by his family and medical
personnel" through regular statements to the media, the next of
which was to be issued Monday at 1500 GMT.


The former captain of Argentina's winning World Cup side and star
for Barcelona and Napoli has seen his career on and off the
football field marred by repeated drug and alcohol abuse.


He has suffered from hepatitis B since 1991, when he played for
Barcelona.


He was hospitalized in 2000 and 2004 for heart attacks provoked
by cocaine overdoses.
