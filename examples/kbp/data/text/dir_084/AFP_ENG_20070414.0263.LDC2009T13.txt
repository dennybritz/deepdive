Irish horse Silver Birch won the Grand National here on Saturday
to give Ireland their fifth winner in the last nine runnings.


The 10-year-old ridden by Robbie Power - the son of legendary
Irish show jumper Con - and trained by Gordon Elliott beat home
McKelvey while Slim Pickings was third.


The winner - a former favourite for the race in 2005 but who lost
form and was sold by English trainer Paul Nicholls for 20,000
pounds - travelled smoothly throughout and came to the fore late
in the second circuit after Naunton Brook and Ballycassidy had
set the pace on the first circuit.


Though headed coming to the last by Slim Pickings, Power got his
nose in front over the fence and despite a brave resurgence by
both Slim Pickings and McKelvey the winner just had enough to
hold on to win at 33/1.


Power said he had had a dream ride on Elliott's first ever runner
in the race.


"I think I should retire!" gushed Power.


"We were never in trouble. Fair dues to Gordon. It won't get
better than this."


Elliott, who has only had a licence for a year, admitted that he
had had butterflies during the race but on the second circuit
they had settled nicely.


"This horse is a real gentleman," said Elliott.


"Everything has gone to plan and I can barely express my words
for what has happended today."


Elliott's joy was another Irishman's sadness as one of their more
fancied runners Point Barrow came down at the first and another
Dun Doire was always trailing while other hotly favoured runners
such as the best backed horse on the day English runner
Monkherhostin refused at the sixth.
