A videotape purportedly showing two French  citizens taken
hostage in Afghanistan was broadcast on Saturday by the Arab news
channel Al-Arabiya.


A bearded man and a veiled woman were seen speaking separately to
the camera, but their voices were inaudible in the footage
broadcast by the Dubai-based Arab television station.


Another section of the tape showed three bearded men, all
blindfolded, sitting on the floor, before one was guided forward
by an outstretched arm holding him.


Al-Arabiya said the videotape had been broadcast by the Canadian
television network CBC, which reported late on Friday that it had
obtained video of two French nationals in which they say they
fear for their lives.


The Canadian broadcaster decided to air only still images from
the video, and did not say how the footage was obtained.


France confirmed on Saturday that the video shows the two
kidnapped French nationals and three Afghans who were abducted
with them, and that it was analysing the pictures.


Paris says it has not received any demands from the kidnappers.


"We remain completely mobilised in Paris and in Afghanistan to
obtain the release of the members of the group," Foreign Minister
Philippe Douste-Blazy said in a statement. "More than ever, our
objective is to bring them back safe and sound."


The French aid workers, from the non-governmental organisation
Terre d'Enfance (A World for Our Children), went missing on April
3 in the southwestern Afghan province of Nimroz.


The Islamist Taliban militia say they are holding them, along
with three of their Afghan colleagues.
