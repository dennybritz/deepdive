At least 20 people died Saturday when a flash food swept over a
popular waterfall in southern Thailand and many more are missing,
a hospital official said.


The tragedy took place at the Sairung waterfall in Trang
province, some 700 kilometers (434 miles) south of Bangkok, the
official said.


"At least 20 people were confirmed dead and some 20 people were
missing," the hospital official said.


Some 100 holidaymakers were at the waterfall as Thailand
celebrated the five-day Buddhist New Year holiday, which started
on Friday.
