A video has been posted on the Internet showing a German army
instructor ordering recruits to shout insults against African-
Americans during a shooting exercise, a news magazine said
Saturday.


Stern magazine said in its online edition that the video was shot
in July 2006 in army barracks in the northern city of Rendsburg.
Excerpts were also shown on German television.


A barracks spokesman confirmed the existence of the video and
said the instructor shown had been posted elsewhere.


The video, which has been viewed by AFP, shows the instructor
first telling recruits to imagine they were fighting plane
hijackers. At the end of the exercise he congratulates them,
saying "That's good, the terrorists are dead."


He then tells them: "Now you're in the Bronx. A black truck stops
in front of you. Three African-Americans get out and insult your
mother grossly. Every time before you pull the trigger I want to
hear you shout 'motherfucker' very loudly".


The junior soldier is then shown executing the order, shouting
the required word before each shot, encouraged by his superior.


In Bonn, an armed forces spokesman said the army had launched an
internal inquiry into the incident, possibly leading to
disciplinary measures against two instructors.


The army is already doing battle with recent scandals.


In the northwestern city of Muenster, 18 German soldiers are on
trial for alleged mistreatment of 163 recruits with electrical
shocks.


Last year, German soldiers were photographed in Afghanistan,
posing with human remains. An inquiry involving 20 soldiers was
launched, and six have already been suspended from duty.
