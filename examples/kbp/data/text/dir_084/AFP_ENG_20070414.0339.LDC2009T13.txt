Spanish Saunier Duval rider Juan Jose Cobo clinched overall
victory in the Tour of the Basque Country on Saturday after he
managed to stay ahead of his compatriot Angel Vicioso in the
final time trial.


"The six days were tough but incredible. Not everyone wins a Tour
nor does it happen every day," said Cobo after securing his first
tour win as a pro.


"After taking two stages and the overall victory I am feeling
much more confident about what I can do in the future," he added.


Cobo went into the 14 kilometre long course around Oiartzun on
Saturday leading the overall standings by just one second from
Relax rider Vicioso.


While Spaniard Samuel Sanchez of Euskatel won the time trial but
with a one minute and 20 second deficit his lead was not enough
to defeat the top two.


Cobo came in four seconds behind the time trial winner while
Vicioso came in 40 seconds behind Sanchez.


"Despite being only 14 kilometres, I suffered as much as I did
yesterday and on the first day," said Cobo.


Cobo took the yellow jersey on the opening stage of the tour,
lost it and then reclaimed it on Friday after another stage win.
