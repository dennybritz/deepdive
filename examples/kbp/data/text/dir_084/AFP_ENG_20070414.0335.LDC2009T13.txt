An alliance of Sunni groups headed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq said in an
Internet statement on Saturday it had kidnapped 20 Iraqi soldiers
and policemen and threatened to kill them in 48 hours if its
demands were not met.


The self-styled Islamic State of Iraq posted still images showing
the purported captives dressed in brown and blue uniforms,
blindfolded and handcuffed.


It demanded the release of "Muslim Sunni sisters who are in the
prisons of the interior" ministry, in the statement posted on a
website used by Islamist militant groups.


"The Islamic State of Iraq gives the government of (Prime
Minister Nuri) al- Maliki 48 hours to meet its demands or it will
execute the rule of God on them," it said.


It also demanded the "turning over of members of the interior
ministry who took part in raping our sister 'Sabrin al-Jarabi'...
and those who killed and displaced our people in (the northern
town of) Tal Afar, and those who participated in raping our
sisters there."


The alleged rape of the woman known by the pseudonym of Janabi,
who appeared in footage broadcast on Arab networks saying she had
been raped by interior ministry officers, triggered a bitter row
at the highest levels in Iraq.


Sunni leaders largely believed her claims, but Shiite Prime
Minister Nuri al- Maliki dismissed them, alleging the rape was
invented by Sunni politicians to tarnish the police at the launch
of a Baghdad security crackdown.
