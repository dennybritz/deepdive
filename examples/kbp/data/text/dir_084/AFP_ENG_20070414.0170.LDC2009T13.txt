American goalkeeper Brad Friedel signed a one-year contract
extension with Blackburn on Saturday.


Friedel, 35, has been in fine form for Rovers this season and has
been rewarded with a new deal, ahead of Sunday's FA Cup semi-
final against Chelsea, that will keep him at Ewood Park until
2009.


The former Liverpool player, who won 82 caps for his country,
said: "Rovers showed great faith in me when I wasn't playing
first team football at Liverpool and I remember things like that.


"This has proved a tremendous move for me and I want to repay the
club by giving of my services for as long as I can."
