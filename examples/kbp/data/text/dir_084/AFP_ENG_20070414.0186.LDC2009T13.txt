At least 23 people died Saturday and many more are missing after
a flash flood swept over a popular waterfall in southern
Thailand, a hospital official and police said.


The tragedy took place at the Sairung waterfall in Trang
province, some 700 kilometres (434 miles) south of Bangkok, the
officials said.


"At least 23 people were confirmed dead and we have learned that
more bodies are coming," the hospital official said, adding that
she did not know how many people were missing.


Most of the victims were women and children, she said.


Police Major General Kachorn Siriwan, in Trang province, said at
least 14 people were still missing.


"People were enjoying the waterfall and suddenly a flash flood
swept over," the police officer said. No further details were
available.


Some 100 holidaymakers were at the waterfall as Thailand
celebrated the five-day Buddhist New Year holiday, which started
on Friday.
