French historian and political economist Rene Remond, who wrote a
standard work on the right-wing in France, died Saturday at the
age of 88, his family said.


In 1954 Remond published his best-known work, "The Right in
France from 1815 to Today", in which he famously divided the
right into three categories -- Legitimists, Orleanists and
Bonapartists -- after the three forms of monarchy in the 19th
century.


He defined the modern Gaullist movement as Bonapartist because it
needed a charismatic and authoritarian central figure, while the
wartime Vichy government was "Legitimist" because it rejected the
institutions of the republic.


He defined the "Orleanist" right as the free-trading bourgeoisie.


President Jacques Chirac said that "a major figure of French
thought has died. An extraordinary teacher, Rene Remond trained
generations of students in critical thought and the demands of
the intellect."
