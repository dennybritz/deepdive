Egyptian police arrested 17 members of the Muslim Brotherhood on
Saturday, including three leaders, on charges of staging a
military-style parade on a university campus, a security official
said.


The prosecutor ordered 14 students from the Agricultural
Cooperative Institute in the northern Cairo suburb of Shubra al-
Kheima to be held for 15 days pending investigation of charges
they held a "military display" on Friday.


The three leading members of the organisation were arrested for
allegedly overseeing the event.


All were charged with forming a military organisation, disturbing
the peace and trying to revive a banned organisation.


Although usually tolerated and engaged in politics with nominally
independent members of parliament, the Muslim Brotherhood is
officially banned in Egypt, leaving it open to periodic
crackdowns.


The Brotherhood is the country's largest and best-organised
opposition movement, with approximately a fifth of the seats in
parliament.


Since Brotherhood-affiliated students held a uniformed martial
arts display at Cairo's Al-Azhar university in December, there
have been widespread crackdowns on the organisation, with
hundreds of its members detained.


The Brotherhood website said Mohammed Abdel Aal, a professor of
medicine at Ain Shams university and the group's leader in east
Cairo, was among those arrested.


It added that a total of 20 students were detained by security
forces.
