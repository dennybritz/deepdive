The Palestinian government on Saturday voted to implement a
security plan aimed at restoring order in the Palestinian
territories and unifying diverse security forces.


"The cabinet finalised the security plan and approved it,"
information minister Mustafa Barghuti told AFP. "The plan
concentrates on providing security to citizens and protection of
people's lives and property."


Barghuti said the plan would focus on bringing law and order to
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, awash with thousands of
guns, by forging cooperation between different factions.


The plan foresees the formation of a national security council
that will bring all security forces under one umbrella so they
can "act collectively with one policy," he said.


The council will be made up of president Mahmud Abbas, Hamas
prime minister Ismail Haniya and the ministers of interior,
finance, justice and foreign affairs.


A new job of general controller of the ministry of interior will
also be created to ensure that security forces, often involved in
factional fighting, themselves stay within the rule of law.


The impoverished Gaza Strip is increasingly lawless despite the
formation of a unity government last month aimed at ending
crippling infighting between the Islamist Hamas and Abbas's
secular Fatah movement.
