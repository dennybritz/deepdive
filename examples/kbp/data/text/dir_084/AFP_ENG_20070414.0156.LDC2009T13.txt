The Polish Catholic church on Saturday criticised lawmakers for
voting down a series of proposals that would have further
strengthened anti-abortion laws in the country.


"Simple parliamentary arthithmetic won out over the fundamental
right to life of all human beings," top bishops said in a
statement.


Abortion laws in Poland, a staunchly Catholic nation, are already
among the strictest in Europe. It is currently only permitted in
cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother's life or
irreversible malformation of the foetus.


On Friday, members of parliament first turned down a proposal by
the hardline Catholic League of Polish Families (LPR), which had
sought to enshrine the "right to life from the moment of
conception" in the constitution. The measure would have opened
the way for a total ban on abortion.


In a further round of voting, they rejected separate proposals by
conservative President Lech Kaczynski, who had sought to set
existing law in stone to prevent any liberalisation by future
administrations.


"The negative result does not weaken efforts to obtain consensus
on a question as fundamental to the future of the nation as it is
to the sanctity of human life," the bishops' statement said.
