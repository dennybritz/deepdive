South African swimming star Roland Schoeman has been excluded
from the national team for refusing to take part in the national
championships in Durban this week.


Swimming South Africa (SSA) reacting to a report in the Saturday
Star newspaper, confirmed that the freestyle sprinter had been
sanctioned.


The Star had also reported that three of the South African
quartet that broke the world record for the men's 4x100 metres
freestyle relay at the 204 Athens Olympics had been thrown off
the team.


The sanction means that Schoeman will be unable to swim in the
Durban leg of the World Cup in October, but will not affect his
chances of competing in next year's Beijing Olympics.


The Star newspaper said that the two other swimmers involved were
Lyndon Ferns and Darian Townsend. Those two along with Schoeman
and Ryk Neethling won the relay gold in Athens with a time of
3:13.17.


The paper said that all three live and train in Arizona and had
been unwilling to pay the airfares to travel over for the
competition.


The South African federation reportedly had offered to pay their
air-fares, but Schoeman had demanded first class tickets, which
were four times more expensive.
