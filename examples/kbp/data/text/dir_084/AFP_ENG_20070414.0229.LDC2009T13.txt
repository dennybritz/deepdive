Thirty-three people, including 15 children, were killed on
Saturday when a bus carrying students and a truck collided in
central Turkey, authorities said.


The accident, which also caused 35 injuries, occurred at around
6:00 am in the province of Aksaray. The public prosecutor for the
province, Durmus Akif Ozbek, provided the number of dead and
injured after visiting a morgue and explained that many had yet
to be identified.


The bus was carrying children from a primary school in the
western city of Izmir on a trip to the tourist region of
Cappadocia, a spokesman for governor Sebati Buyuran told AFP.


In Izmir, officials with a crisis team put together by the school
told Anatolia news agency that those killed included 15 children,
16 chaperones and the drivers of the two vehicles.


The prosecutor confirmed the deaths of the two drivers and said
that at least 15 children were among the injured being treated.


The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Ozbek said
there were 68 people on board, and Anatolia reported that the bus
only had the capacity to carry 46 passengers.


"Three children were crowded into each pair of seats," a
chaperone told Anatolia. "There were too many passengers on the
bus."


One of the two drivers of the bus, who was asleep in the back at
the time of the accident, said the vehicle was not overloaded.


Five of the injured were in serious condition, including three
children, said a health official in Aksaray, Akin Sudemen.


CNN-Turk showed pictures of the overturned bus on the side of the
road, with baggage strewn around the site, and of relatives of
the children in tears at their school.
