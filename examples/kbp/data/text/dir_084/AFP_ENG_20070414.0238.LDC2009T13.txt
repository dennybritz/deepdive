Russian opposition leader Garry Kasparov was charged Saturday
with demonstrating illegally, his lawyer said after the former
chess champion was arrested in Moscow at a banned rally, Interfax
news agency reported.


"Kasparov is accused of walking in a big group and shouting anti-
government slogans," lawyer Karinna Moskalenko said, Interfax
reported.


According to Moskalenko, a Moscow court was deliberating whether
Kasparov had violated the terms of Saturday's opposition
demonstration.


The city had authorised a protest, but not on the central Pushkin
Square, which Kasparov was trying to enter at the time of his
arrest.


Earlier, Kasparov told Sky News television by telephone that he
was being taken from a police station to the court.


"I am with a group, with our lawyer and the group of some other
activists on the way to court," he told the channel.


"Right now I am in the police van. I think they are thoroughly
confused because so many people were arrested," he said. "Many
were arrested and beaten."


Riot police detained as many as 200 demonstrators, including
Kasparov, in a crackdown on a banned protest in the centre of the
capital. Many were almost immediately released.
