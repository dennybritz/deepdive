Brazilian Felipe Massa has vowed not to give rookie McLaren
Mercedes-Benz driver Lewis Hamilton any room ahead of Sunday's
Bahrain Grand Prix near Manama.


Massa, who pipped Hamilton to pole by three tenths of a second in
Saturday's qualifying session, was a disappointing fifth despite
claiming pole for the race in Malaysia last Sunday thanks largely
to the skill of rookie Briton Hamilton.


The Brazilian was overtaken by Hamilton at the start and then
made a mistake when trying to overtake him forcing the Ferrari
driver off the track and forcing him down to fifth place, where
he finished.


However Massa revealed he is ready for the challenge that the
young Briton will pose for him on Hamilton's first start on the
front row.


"I think he made a good start but we also gave him space, so this
time we know what he can do - so we won't give him the space any
more," said Massa after qualifying.


"Last Sunday was not an easy day for us," Massa added. "McLaren
showed incredible pace in the race, we did not show our pace as
we were always blocked by other cars, our pace was better than we
showed although it was difficult, and McLaren were very, very
strong.


"Today (Saturday) we were competitive on old tyres so I hope we
can show a much better pace tomorrow (Sunday) than we had in
Malaysia."
