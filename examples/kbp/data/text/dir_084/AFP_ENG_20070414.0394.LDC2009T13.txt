The Nashville Predators, who knotted their National Hockey League
playoff series with San Jose at one game each with a win Friday,
will be without a key player as they try to edge ahead on Monday.


The NHL suspended Predators rookie Alexander Radulov for one game
on Saturday, a day after he checked Sharks left wing Steve
Bernier from behind in game two, which the Predators won 5-2.


Radulov will miss game three at San Jose on Monday.


After scoring two goals in Nashville's 5-4 double-overtime loss
in game one, his first career postseason contest, Radulov
registered a tally and an assist in the first period of Friday's
matchup. However, the 20-year-old right wing drilled Bernier into
the boards at 4:44 of the second session, drawing a five-minute
major and game misconduct.


Bernier, who was helped off the ice by a pair of teammates, was
taken to a local hospital for precautionary X-rays to his head
and neck.


The results and his status for game three were not yet known.
