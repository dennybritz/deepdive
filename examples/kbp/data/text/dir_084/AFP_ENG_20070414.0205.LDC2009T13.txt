Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has not contacted me but I have
no problem leading the team. I don't see any kind of pressure in
the job. I think I'm a worthy candidate as in the last year I
have really proven myself. It has always been an honour to
represent Pakistan and it would be a real pleasure to lead the
team at this difficult time."


- Mohammad Yousuf willing to take over from Inamam-ul-Haq as
Pakistan skipper


"We gave it a second thought, but the World Cup is a World Cup
whether your own team is here or not."


- Fahad Sheikh, a Pakistani fan who has travelled from Bradford,
England to Barbados. He had been hoping to see India and Pakistan
play - instead he will be seeing Bangladesh take on Ireland on
Sunday.


"We are on a really good run at the moment. It's all a matter of
the attitude being right for the rest of this tournament and you
should see some more good cricket from us."


- Australia captain Ricky Ponting on his team reaching 25 matches
in a row unbeaten at the World Cup.


"We're very used to travel, play, travel, play. So there's no
excuse there in not being able to back it up. Every international
team has to do it."


- New Zealand coach John Bracewell unconcerned by the hectic
World Cup schedule.


"We know we have to win every game from here but another four
wins and we'll be lifting the World Cup."


- England pace bowler James Anderson optimistic of his team's
chances.
