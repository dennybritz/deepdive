South Africa were 12-2 after 10 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against New Zealand at the Grenada National Stadium
Saturday after being put into bat under heavy skies.


Herschelle Gibbs was on five with Jacques Kallis on four.


South Africa were 3-2 after three overs when Shane Bond had
captain Graeme Smith caught by Jacob Oram for one while James
Franklin had AB de Villiers lbw four nought.


It was de Villiers's fourth duck in the World Cup.


Both countries made one change from the teams that played in
previous matches at the stadium.


Left-arm spinner Robin Peterson came into the South African side
for batsman Loots Bosman.


South Africa beat West Indies by 67 runs Tuesday.


New Zealand added offspinner Jeetan Patel in place of pace bowler
Mark Gillespie from the side beaten by six wickets by Sri Lanka
Thursday.


New Zealand have eight points with South Africa on six points and
a win on Saturday will put the Kiwis into the semi-finals.
