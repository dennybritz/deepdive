The 2008 Dubai Marathon will be the richest long distance running
event in history after it was announced on Saturday that should
one of the winners of the men's or women's races break the world
road race record then they would earn a million dollar bonus.


The first prize for both men and women for the Marathon on
January 18, 2008 will be 250,000 dollars.


That doubles the current leading marathon prize of 125,000
dollars for the Chicago Marathon. The further attraction for
leading runners is that the Dubai prize money is tax-free.


The race was the idea of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,
Vice  President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates,
Ruler of Dubai, who wants to make the 10-year-old marathon equal
to the status of other multi-million dollar sports events in
Dubai, such as the Dubai World Cup horse race, the Dubai Desert
Classic golf tournament, and the Dubai Tennis Open.


The 1million dollar prize fund means the Dubai race is by far the
richest event on the marathon calendar easily outstripping the
prize money available in the big five races in London, Berlin,
New York, Chicago and Boston.
