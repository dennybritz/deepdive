A court in Copenhagen on Wednesday sentenced a Moroccan-born
Danish man to three and a half years in prison for promoting
terrorism, according to the Ritzau news agency.


The conviction of Said Mansour, 46, was the first under tightened
anti-terror legislation adopted by Denmark in 2002 in the wake of
the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.


He was arrested in September 2005 on charges of incitement to
terrorist acts.


He was specifically accused of having produced and distributed
some 12,000 CD and tape covers as well as CDs, DVDs and videos,
containing speeches and chants where people linked to terrorist
organisations called for jihad (holy war) and praised terrorists.
