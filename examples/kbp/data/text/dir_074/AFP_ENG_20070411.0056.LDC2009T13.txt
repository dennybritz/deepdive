Five candidates contesting East Timor's presidential election
filed a formal protest Wednesday saying the poll was not fairly
conducted, and that counting should be stopped immediately.


"We ask the authorities to stop immediately the counting of
votes," they said in a joint statement, citing a climate of
intimidation and terror around the poll as one of the reasons for
their action.


The protest was made in a letter to the country's election
commission that was copied to the UN Mission in East Timor and
the tiny nation's current president, Xanana Gusmao.
