Chinese share prices reached a new high Wednesday, adding 1.48
percent on continuing strong buying interest, with banking stocks
and steelmakers gaining ground, dealers said.


They said the bullish run will continue in the short term as more
companies will issue their annual and quarterly reports with
better results.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares, closed up 50.93 points at 3,495.22. Turnover was still
heavy, setting a new record of 156.21 billion yuan (20.20 billion
US dollars).
