Argentine football legend Diego Maradona checked out of a private
hospital in the early morning hours of Wednesday after 13 days of
treatment for alcohol abuse, medical officials said in a
statement.


The former Argentina captain and Barcelona and Napoli star, 46,
was discharged a few minutes after midnight accompanied by family
members.


A medical report distributed to the media said that Maradona "was
given a clean bill of health on this day," but added his
condition required medical and dietary treatment to continue
after his release.


Earlier his personal doctor Alfredo Cahe said he was not fully
recovered from hepatitis which developed from drinking too much.


"We cannot give him a full clean bill of health, because that is
far down the road," Cahe told reporters.


However, he said, "Diego has woken up and has just now entered
into analysis of his true problems."


A family source said at the hospital said Maradona would be taken
to the home of his girlfriend Veronica Ojeda in the south side of
Buenos Aires, but that could not be confirmed.


But Cahe has also said that he and Maradona will go to
Switzerland for a comprehensive treatment for the retired
footballer's problems.
