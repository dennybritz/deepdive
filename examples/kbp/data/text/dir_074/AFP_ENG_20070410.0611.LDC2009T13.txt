Australian Open champion Serena Williams bowed out of the WTA
claycourt tournament here Tuesday, retiring from her second-round
match against Taiwan's Chan Yung-Jan.


Williams trailed 3-5 when she called it a day, having suffered a
right groin strain earlier in the set.


The departure of the third seed put paid to hopes of a third-
round meeting with her sister, Venus, who had done her part
earlier with a 6-2, 6-2 first-round thumping of Australian
Samanatha Stosur.


Serena Williams had taken last week off after posting a hard-
fought victory over Belgian Justine Henin in the final of the
prestigious hardcourt tournament at Miami - adding that title to
the Australian Open crown she captured in January in her eighth
Grand Slam triumph.


The 1.39 million-dollar tournament also lost top seeded Czech
Nicole Vaidisova on Tuesday as Michaella Krajicek rallied to beat
her 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the second round.


Venus Williams, a five-time Grand Slam champion, is unseeded. She
won a tournament in Memphis in February, but fell in the quarter-
finals last week at Amelia Island, Florida.


The 2004 champion here, she will face Russian Vasilisa Bardina in
the second round.


France's Tatiana Golovin, who captured her first career title
with a victory in the Amelia Island final on Sunday, defeated
Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia to reach the second round.
