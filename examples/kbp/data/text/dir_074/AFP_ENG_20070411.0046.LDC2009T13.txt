An Indian airforce helicopter crashed Wednesday on the Siachen
glacier in disputed Kashmir leaving the two pilots missing, an
army spokesman said.


"An Indian airforce Cheetah helicopter has crashed in Siachen
glacier after it left the base camp on a routine sortie," said
the spokesman, who asked to remain unnamed.


"The fate of two pilots in the helicopter is not known yet."


An airforce spokesman in New Delhi said a search was under way.


The 6,300-metre (20,800-feet) high Siachen glacier, like the
Himalayan region of Kashmir, is held in parts by India and
Pakistan.


The two sides fought regular artillery duels in the region up to
November 2003 when a ceasefire was agreed along the heavily-
militarised Line of Control.


Siachen holds little strategic value but the Indian army, which
has occupied most of the glacier since 1987, refuses to reduce
its forces.


Experts say Pakistan has less than half the number of India's
5,000 soldiers on the frigid wasteland, where temperatures
plummet to minus 50 degrees Celsius (minus 58 degrees
Fahrenheit).


Kashmir has sparked two of the three wars between India and
Pakistan since 1947.
