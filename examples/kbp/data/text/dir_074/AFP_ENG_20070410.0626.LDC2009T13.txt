Twenty-one Chechen rebels have been killed and 138 arrested so
far this year, a senior Russian interior ministry official said
Tuesday.


"We are undertaking considerable efforts against clandestine
fighters. Since the beginning of the year we have arrested 138
fighters and killed 21," Alexander German, a deputy director of
police operations in the North Caucasus, said in an interview
released on the interior ministry's website.


He said 106 rebels had surrendered their weapons during that
period.


Some 127 weapons, more than 40,000 rounds of ammunition, 653
shells and mines, 338 grenades, 19 improvised explosive devices
and more than 100 kilogrammes (220 pounds) of explosives were
seized, he said.


Chechnya continues to be rocked by instability despite claims by
the Russian authorities to have normalised the situation after
years of separatist conflict dating back to the early 1990s.
