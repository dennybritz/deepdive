East Timor's presidential election was Wednesday headed for a
second round of voting after three candidates were neck and neck
after 70 percent of ballots had been counted, officials said.


Fernando "Lasama" de Araujo, the chairman of the opposition
Democrat Party, was fractionally ahead after garnering 21.7
percent of the overall vote, said the National Election
Commission.


However tiny nation's prime minister, Jose Ramos-Horta, was right
behind with 21.7 percent of the vote and the candidate of the
ruling Fretilin party, Francisco "Lu-Olo" Guterres, was third
with 21.39 percent.


The three-way split almost certainly means there will be a second
round run-off between the leading two candidates on May 8.
