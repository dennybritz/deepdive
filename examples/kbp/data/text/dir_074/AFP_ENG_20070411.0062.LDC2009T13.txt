Wen Jiabao arrived Wednesday in Tokyo on the first visit by a
Chinese premier to Japan in seven years as the Asian powers work
to repair ties.


The Chinese prime minister touched down just after 4:30 pm (0730
GMT) at Tokyo's Haneda airport and was due to meet later with
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.


"Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, welcome to Japan," read a sign at the
airport.


Wen is the first Chinese leader to visit Japan since then premier
Zhu Rongji in 2000.


China refused summits with Abe's predecessor Junichiro Koizumi
due to his visits to a war shrine associated with Japanese
imperialism.
