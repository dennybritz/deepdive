China plans a full overhaul of policies favoring its export
sector in an effort to rein in its huge trade surplus and reduce
tensions with major trading partners, state media said Wednesday.


The government will gradually shift away from its former strategy
of actively encouraging exports, the China Business News said,
citing Wang Shouwen, head of the foreign trade department of the
Commerce Ministry.


Wang, who made the remarks at a conference held on Tuesday
analysing possible international trade disputes in 2007, was not
quoted as giving more specific details.


The government has already started to overhaul various export
subsidies, terminating those banned by the World Trade
Organisation and reassessing others that could attract legal
challenges, the report said.


Wang made the comments on the same day that the United States
formally lodged two complaints at the World Trade Organisation on
copyright violations in China and market access for films, music
and books.


Last month, Washington announced another decision to impose
penalty tariffs on Chinese paper exporters, reversing a 23-year-
old US policy of not applying duties to subsidised goods from so-
called non-market economies such as China.


Experts believed the US moves reflected growing pressure on
Washington to address its yawning trade deficit with the Asian
giant, which hit more than 200 billion dollars last year,
according to US statistics.
