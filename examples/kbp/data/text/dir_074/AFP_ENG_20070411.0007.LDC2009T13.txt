Chinese share prices rose 1.40 percent in Wednesday morning trade
on sustained buying interest with banking stocks and steelmakers
gaining ground, dealers said.


They said the bullish run will continue in the short term as more
companies will issue their annual and quarterly reports with
better results while a technical correction can be seen after the
index moves closer to 3,500 points.


"Strength in heavyweight stocks such as banks and steelmakers
continued to send indices higher, but a technical correction
could emerge as the Shanghai Composite moves close to 3,500
points," said Zeng Bo, an analyst at Changjiang Securities.


"In the short term though, the strong momentum is likely to
continue, as more companies issue better-than-expected annual and
quarterly results in coming weeks," Zeng added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares, ended the morning up 48.12 points at 3,492.41, after
hitting a new all-time intraday high of 3,493.11.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 51.06 points or 1.41 percent at
3,671.36 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was up 4.90 points or
0.51 percent at 965.67, also a new record.
