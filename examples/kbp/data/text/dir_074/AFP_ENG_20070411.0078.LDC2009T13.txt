The trial of six Lebanese accused of attempting to bomb trains in
Germany last July opened in Beirut on Wednesday.


Four suspects, who have been in Lebanese custody since September
4, appeared at the Beirut criminal court under tight security.


The four are main suspect Jihad Hamad as well as Khaled al-Hajj
Dib, Ayman Hawwa and Khalil Bubu, judicial sources said.


Saddam al-Hajj Dib and his brother Yusef Mohammed al-Hajj Dib,
who was arrested in Germany last August on similar charges and
remain in custody, are being tried in absentia.


Hamad has confessed under judicial interrogation to having placed
a suitcase containing explosives on a train in Germany last July,
Lebanese judicial sources said.


"The intention was not to kill people, but to avenge any harm
done to Muslims after the publication in Denmark of cartoons that
were harmful to the Prophet Mohammed," Hamad was quoted as saying
by the sources.


German federal police said the publication of cartoons of the
Prophet Mohammed in Western and some Arab media had been the
"detonator" which pushed the alleged terrorists to organise a
plot to bomb German trains on July 31.


The plan failed when bombs concealed on two regional trains did
not explode because of faulty detonators.
