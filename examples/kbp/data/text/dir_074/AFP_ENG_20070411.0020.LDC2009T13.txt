Bangladesh's military-backed government has severely restricted
the freedom of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, media reports
said Wednesday.


Law enforcing agencies had imposed a ban on Zia meeting anyone
except "four designated persons," the private UNB news agency
said.


The ban was reported just hours after the head of the previous
government warned Bangladesh was at a "crossroads" and called for
"unity."
