China agreed Wednesday to lift a four-year ban on Japanese rice
imports ahead of a summit between the Asian powers, Japanese
officials said.


The two countries signed an agreement allowing Japan to ship rice
to China later this year, a farm ministry official said.


China in 2003 banned rice imports from Japan, saying insects were
found in a shipment, and efforts to resume the trade had earlier
faltered amid tense relations between the two countries.


China is the world's largest rice consumer, although it is self-
sufficient. Japan, which heavily protects its rice farmers, is
looking to tap a market among wealthy Chinese consumers for high-
end rice.


The agreement was signed between Japanese farm minister
Toshikatsu Matsuoka and Li Changjiang, director of the Chinese
General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine, the farm ministry official said.


The signing in Tokyo came hours ahead of a meeting between
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
that is likely to set the tone for warmer bilateral ties.


The two countries want to show the rice trade as an example of a
"a mutually beneficial strategic partnership" between the two
countries, another Japanese official said.


Wen is scheduled to arrive later Wednesday in Tokyo, becoming the
first Chinese premier to visit in seven years.
