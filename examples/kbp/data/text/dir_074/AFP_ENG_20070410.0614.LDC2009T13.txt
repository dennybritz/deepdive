Japanese machinery orders, a key gauge of corporate capital
spending, fell by a bigger-than-expected 5.2 percent in February
from the previous month, the government said Wednesday.


Market forecasts had been for a decrease of about 0.2 percent
after a rise of 3.9 percent in January.


Year-on-year, core private sector machinery orders were down 4.2
percent in February, after rising 2.6 percent in January.


Private-sector core machinery orders exclude orders from electric
utilities and for ships.
