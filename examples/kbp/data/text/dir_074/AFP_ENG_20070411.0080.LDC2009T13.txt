South Korea on Wednesday turned over 134 trucks and bulldozers to
the poorly equipped Philippine military, highlighting close
defence ties between the two countries.


The 127 cargo and dump trucks and seven bulldozers were provided
to the Philippines as a grant with Manila paying "token"
transport costs of about 72,000 dollars, said military chief
General Hermogenes Esperon.


In a ceremony at the Philippine military headquarters in Manila,
Esperon told South Korean ambassador Jong Ki Hong that "relations
between the two nations defence establishments and armed forces
have grown stronger."


The Philippines was one of the nations that provided troops to
defend South Korea during the 1950-53 Korean war.


The Philippine military is still battling communist insurgents
and Muslim extremists in the hinterlands.
