Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Wednesday he will
freeze his salary for five years and will "donate" the increase
that boosted his annual income to more than two million US
dollars.


His decision comes amid a furore over the hike in the city-state
which faces a widening income gap.


"I will hold my own salary at its present level for five years,"
the prime minister said in parliament.


Lee's salary was 1.62 million US dollars last year.


"The government will pay me my full pay because that is how the
system must work but for five years I will donate the increase in
my salary from this and subsequent revisions," he said.


The prime minister's salary increase was among pay rises for
civil servants announced on Monday.


Lee told parliament he wanted "to make quite clear why I am doing
this and to give me the moral standing to defend this policy to
Singaporeans."


Lee's revised salary would be five times more than the 400,000 US
dollars paid to US President George W. Bush and more than eight
times that of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who receives
240,000 US dollars a year.


The increase has been among the most passionately debated issues
in recent years, and many Singaporeans -- usually reserved --
were untypically blunt in their reactions.


Salary increases were also given to other cabinet ministers and
senior civil servants.
