Jean-Pierre Bemba, the former vice president and failed
presidential candidate whose guards clashed with the military
last month, left the Democratic Republic of Congo Wednesday bound
for Portugal, airport officials said.


Bemba boarded a Boeing 727 bound for Lisbon with his wife and
five children which left at 2 am (0100 GMT).


The former rebel leader had been holed up at the South African
embassy in Kinshasa since violent clashes between his supporters
and government troops on March 22-23 in which more than 200
people were killed, according to diplomats.


The clashes were sparked by plans to remove many of Bemba's
guards and integrate them into the army, and the government later
issued an arrest warrant against him on charges of treason and
maintaining a militia, although he enjoys parliamentary immunity.


Negotiations for Bemba to leave the country have been underway
for a couple of weeks, and the official reason for his departure
has been to seek medical treatment for a leg injury sustained
when he fell down stairs in December.


UN peacekeepers transported Bemba and his family from the South
African embassy to the airport.


Bemba lost the presidential election to incumbent Joseph Kabila
last December, in one of the series of elections that were the
first in the war-shattered DRC for more than four decades and the
first since independence in 1960 to be considered free and fair.
