A meeting of Nigeria's top police brass was under way Wednesday
to review the security situation ahead of this month's general
elections, a spokesman said.


"The Inspector-general of Police Sunday Ehindero called the
meeting for this morning to assess the security situation in the
country. All assistant inspectors-general of police and police
commissioners from the 36 states and Abuja are in attendance,"
Haz Iwendi told AFP.


He said the meeting would take briefings from the officers on the
security situation in their respective states following reports
of a spate of political violence in the run-up to Saturday's
governorship, state assembly and next week's presidential polls.


Iwendi said the meeting would also decide on the number of police
officers to be deployed across the country in order to ensure a
hitch-free poll.


Five people were killed in Ibadan on Tuesday when supporters of
two rival parties clashed during a campaign rally.
