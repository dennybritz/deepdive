A fuel spill in Shanghai has dumped 45 tonnes of oil in the
Chinese city's main waterway, endangering drinking water
supplies, a state press report said Wednesday.


The spill occurred on the Huangpu River late Monday when
operators filling a tanker failed to shut off the valves, the
Shanghai Daily reported, citing the Shanghai Maritime Safety
Administration.


Authorities said the spill had been brought under control Tuesday
but called on three water purifying facilities to monitor for
contamination, the newspaper said.


The officials said it would take time to complete the clean-up,
without giving any specifics.
