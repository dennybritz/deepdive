Mount Etna, the highest active volcano in Europe, erupted
overnight on Wednesday sending jets of molten lava into the air
but not threatening nearby residents.


The white-hot lava jets were thrown 200 meters (650 feet) above
Etna while a spout on the southeast flank of the volcano released
two streams of lava in the direction of an uninhabited area.


There was a similar eruption on March 29 while last December the
nearby airport of Catania had to be closed at night for two weeks
because of ash blown into the atmosphere by volcanic activity.


Etna's last major eruption was in summer 2001.
