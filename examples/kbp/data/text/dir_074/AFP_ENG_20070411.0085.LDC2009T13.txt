Anglo-Swiss mining company Xstrata said Wednesday that it would
sell its aluminium operations to US private equity group Apollo
Management for 1.15 billion dollars (857 million euros).


The sale of Xstrata Aluminium, which comprises all of Xstrata's
aluminium interests, was expected to be completed in the second
quarter, the mining company said in a statement.


Xstrata Aluminum was created from Falconbridge's aluminium
assets, known as Noranda Aluminum, following Xstrata's takeover
of the Canadian group last year.


"Xstrata plc announces the disposal of Xstrata Aluminum,
comprising all of Xstrata's aluminium interests, to Apollo
Management LP for a total cash consideration of 1.15 billion
dollars," the statement read.
