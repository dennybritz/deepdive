South Korea's third largest mobile handset maker Pantech and its
affiliate have been ordered to delist their shares because losses
have wiped out the companies' entire capital, officials said
Wednesday.


The delisting of Pantech Co and of Pantech and Curitel
Communications would take effect on April 25, the Korea Exchange
said in a statement.


The two units are burdened by debts of some two trillion won (2.1
billion dollars). Panetch is the country's third largest handset
maker following Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics.


The delisting comes amid local news reports that the Pantech
units face bankruptcy as creditors disagree over a debt
rehabilitation programme.
