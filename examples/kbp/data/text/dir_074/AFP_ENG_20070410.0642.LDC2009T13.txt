Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade re-appointed Tuesday the
government of Prime Minister Macky Sall, a government official
said.


Sall, 45, who has headed the government since 2004, presented his
resignation as tradition demands following a presidential
election, but was immediately re- appointed to his post.


Wade, 80, was reelected in February to another five-year term,
which he formally took up last week.


Sall decided to "keep the same team. The government isn't
changing," an official in his office said.
