A Beijing district chief is under investigation over dubious
property transactions, state press reported Wednesday, citing
unnamed sources with the district government.


If confirmed, the case would be the second time a senior official
in the capital is implicated in a nationwide crackdown on illegal
property deals, after the arrest of former vice mayor Liu Zhihua
last June for alleged graft.


Zhou Liangluo, the 49-year-old chief of Beijing's Haidian
district, has been detained by the Central Disciplinary Committee
of the ruling Communist party, the China Business News reported.


"I heard days ago that Zhou was detained and I myself have not
seen him over past days," said a staff member surnamed Xu with
the general office of district government when contacted by AFP.


Zhou's case could involve land issues, the paper said, but it was
not related to an ongoing graft probe into Liu, who oversaw the
city's construction projects for the 2008 Olympic Games.


Liu's sacking was the biggest corruption scandal to hit Beijing
since former city party secretary Chen Xitong was jailed for 16
years for corruption in 1998.


The Communist Party's disciplinary committee has the authority to
place officials under "soft house arrest" at a "designated time
and a designated place" to undergo interrogation over potential
wrongdoing.
