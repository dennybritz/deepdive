After serious disturbances by English football fans at matches in
Rome and Seville last week, European football authorities were
able to breath a sigh of relief on Wednesday.


The Champions League quarter-final second leg between Valencia
and Chelsea on Tuesday, which the London side won 2-1 to go
through to the semi-finals 3-2 on aggregate, passed off without
any incident inside the ground.


An estimated 3,000 Chelsea supporters followed their team to the
Mediterranean to see them make the Champions League semi-finals
for the third time in four years but Spanish police said that
only one arrest had been made.


Police said that a man had been detained following an unspecified
incident earlier on Thursday following an unspecified incident
earlier on Thursday on the Euromed long-distance train.


Around 600 additional police had been assigned to provide
security before and during the game.
