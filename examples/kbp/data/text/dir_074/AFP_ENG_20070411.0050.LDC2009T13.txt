An Iraqi mother and her school-age son were killed on Wednesday
in crossfire between police officers and gunmen in the country's
third city of Mosul, police said.


Major Mohammed Ahmed said the incident happened in a western
suburb of Mosul, one week after Iraqi security forces and US
troops extended a massive security crackdown in Baghdad to the
sprawling northern city.


A roadside bomb also ripped through a police patrol in Mosul's
central Al-Shifa district, wounding 13 people, including three
policemen, police said.


The bodies of four women and three Iraqi soldiers were found
dumped with a bullet to the head in various parts of Mosul -- an
execution-style killing that has dropped drastically in Baghdad
since the crackdown began on February 14.


South of the capital, a roadside bomb attack killed one police
man and wounded another three as they were patrolling the Shiite
city of Hilla, said police Lieutenant Hamid al-Khalidi.


The launch of the new Baghdad security offensive has seen
violence spike in outlying provinces as insurgents melt away from
the thrust of tens of thousands of Iraqi and US troops patrolling
the capital's streets.
