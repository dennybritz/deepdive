Japanese share prices closed marginally higher Wednesday with
buying limited by worries about domestic corporate capital
spending, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 5.38 points or 0.03 percent to finish at 17,670.07. The
broader TOPIX index of all first- section issues rose 3.32 points
or 0.19 percent to close at 1,739.01.
