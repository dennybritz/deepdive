British removal men showed that moving grand pianos was not their
forte by dropping a 26,000 pound (38,000 euro, 51,000 dollar)
instrument off the back of a lorry, media reported Wednesday.


The nine foot (four metre) long Bosendorfer concert grand was
being delivered to the Two Moors Musical Festival in Devon,
southwest England, where locals had spent two years raising the
money to buy it.


Festival organiser Penny Adie was taking photographs of the
piano's eagerly- anticipated arrival for the event's archive when
the ivories tinkled to the ground.


"It made a noise like 10 honky-tonk pianos being hit by mallets,"
she told the Daily Telegraph. "Half a ton of piano landing like
that must have had a catastrophic effect on its workings."


The Bosendorfer -- known as the Rolls-Royce of pianos and
favoured by the likes of Hungarian composer Franz Liszt -- is
expected to be written off by insurers.


Although it cost 26,000 pounds to buy at auction, it could cost
double that to replace.


"A Bosendorfer is to a pianist what a Stradivarius is to a string
player and we are all numb with shock at what has happened,"
Adie's husband John told the paper.


London-based G and R Removals, the specialist firm which bungled
the move, declined to comment, the Telegraph said.
