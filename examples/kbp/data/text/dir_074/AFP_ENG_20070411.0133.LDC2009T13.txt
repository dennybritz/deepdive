Inflation in Iran will top 23 percent in the current Iranian
year, well over the current official figures, a parliamentary
report quoted in the press said on Wednesday.


The report by parliament's research centre said inflation in the
last Iranian year that ended on March 20 was running at 22.4
percent, compared with the central bank's figure of 13.5 percent.


It said inflation for the current year would be even higher at
23.4 percent.


The figures come amid concern about rising prices in Iran,
especially for staples like poultry and vegetables, which is
being felt in the poorer sections of society.


Economists have long cast doubt over the official inflation
figures -- saying the real rate is almost double -- and have
warned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that expansionary economic
policies could fuel inflation further.


The government has increased the minimum wage for workers by 20
percent in an apparent response to inflation.


Parliament's research centre said money supply -- a key indicator
of future price trends -- would rise by 41 percent in the current
year.


Several deputies in the conservative-dominated Iranian parliament
expressed concerns about the budget for the current year but the
bill was ultimately passed without major problems for the
government.


Ahmadinejad has been criticised for high spending on fulfilling
promises he made during rallies on provincial trips up and down
the country.
