East Timor's presidential election will go to a runoff with the
ruling Fretilin party's Francisco Guterres facing off against one
other challenger, the national election commission told AFP
Wednesday.


"Guterres is already cleared for the second round," said Faustino
Cardoso, the commission's president.


Guterres, popularly known as Lu-Olo, had a 28.3 percent share
with 354,033 votes counted.


More than 520,000 people were registered to vote in the tiny
country's first presidential election since independence in 2002.
