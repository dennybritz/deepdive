A British woman was found asleep at the wheel in the French
Riviera at the weekend, 10 times over the legal alcohol limit,
French police said late Tuesday.


Tests showed that the 46-year-old, who was parked on the hard
shoulder not far from her home in the hills above Nice, had 5.28
grammes of alcohol per litre of blood.


She was immediately stripped of her driving licence, and was to
appear in court in the coming days.


The drink-driving limit in France is 0.5 grammes of alcohol per
litre of blood, or 50 milligrammes per 100 millilitres. In
Britain the legal limit is 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100
millilitres.
