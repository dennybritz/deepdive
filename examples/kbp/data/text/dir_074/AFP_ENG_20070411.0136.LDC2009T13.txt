A Japanese man enraged when his ferret bit him was arrested
Wednesday for torturing the pet and dozens of other animals and
then posting footage of the abuse online, police and media
reports said.


Shinichi Moriyama, 30, choked, hit and even bit the ferret and
then posted the footage on an online bulletin board, said a
police spokesman in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo.


Horrified web-surfers alerted police who took Moriyama into
custody, he said.


The unemployed man recounted on the Internet his reasons for
torturing his pet. "I bit it in the leg to take revenge after
being bitten on the finger," he said, according to Kyodo News.


"I did it to relieve stress," he was quoted by Japanese media as
telling police.


He admitted abusing between 20 to 30 ferrets since 2005, some of
whom died.


Moriyama faces a fine of up to 500,000 yen (4,200 dollars) for
animal abuse, the police spokesman said.
