Charlotte Bobcats rookie forward Adam Morrison was fined 25,000
dollars by the National Basketball Association on Tuesday for
making an obscene gesture during a game against the Miami Heat.


Stu Jackson, the NBA's vice president of basketball operations,
announced the fine.


The incident occurred with 1:18 remaining in the Bobcats' 111-103
overtime victory at Miami on Sunday. Morrison made the gesture
despite missing the game with a sprained tendon in his left knee.


In 77 games this season, Morrison is averaging 11.9 points.
