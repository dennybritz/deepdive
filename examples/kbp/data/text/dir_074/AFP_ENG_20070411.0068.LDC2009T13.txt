Communist rebels brutally killed a family of four as they slept
in the southern Philippines, the military said Wednesday.


Armed men, believed to be New People's Army (NPA) rebels, forced
their way into the home of Fernando Gonzaga in Davao city and
shot him, his wife and two children aged 15 and nine, the army
said.


A motive for the attack was not known, but the army said NPA
rebels could have mistaken Gonzaga for a "military informant."


The NPA is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, which has been waging a Maoist rebellion against the
government since 1969 in one of the world's longest running
communist insurgencies.


President Gloria Arroyo has vowed to crush the rebel movement
before her six- year term ends in 2010.
