Hungarian consumer prices rose by 9.0 percent in March on a
12-month basis and by 0.8 percent from the February levels, the
central statistics bureau KSH reported on Wednesday.


The rise reflected big cuts in state subsidies for the cost of
energy for households, in particular gas.


The rollback of state subsidies is a major part of the
government's effort to cut spending in order to rein in a runaway
public deficit, which was nearly 10 percent of gross domestic
product in 2006.


In addition to subsidy cuts, inflation has been fuelled by tax
rises, announced last year, in order to increase state revenue.


The central bank forecasts 2007 inflation to average 7.4 percent,
followed by 3.4 percent in 2008.


Average inflation was 3.9 percent in 2006.
