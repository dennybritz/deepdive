Puma, the German maker of sportsgear, does not rule out a higher
takeover bid from French luxury goods group PPR, the German
company's chief executive Jochen Zeitz said on Wednesday.


"Fundamentally, the price (of 330 euros per share) stands. But
we'll see," Zeitz told ZDF public television.


On Tuesday, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, owner of Gucci and Yves
Saint Laurent, said it was offering 330 euros per share or 5.3
billion euros in all for Puma after acquiring a stake of 27.1
percent in the sports shoe maker.


But investors appear to be speculating on an even higher price,
with Puma shares changing handds at 349 euros on the Frankfurt
stock exchange on Wednesday, up 1.47 percent on the day after
already shooting up 9.44 percent on Tuesday.


Zeitz said it was ultimately to investors to decide whether to
accept PPR's bid at the current price, as it was also up to PPR
whether to raise the offer.


But the 330-euro price tag as it stood was "logical" and had been
"confirmed" by Puma's investment bank advisors, he insisted.


A week ago, prior to the takeover rumours, Puma shares had been
trading at around 270-280 euros, Zeitz pointed out.


Asked whether there was a chance of a competing bid from Puma's
arch-rival Nike, Zeitz refused to rule it out, although he viewed
the chances as "relatively slim".


"The possibility is always there and we would consider it from
the shareholders' point of view," the CEO said.


But the PPR bid was "good" for the company, he insisted.
