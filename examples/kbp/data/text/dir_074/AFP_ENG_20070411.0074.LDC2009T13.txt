Anglo-Dutch energy group Royal Dutch Shell on Wednesday said it
would pay 352.6 million dollars (262.7 million euros) to settle
non-US claims related to its oil reserves crisis three years ago.


"Royal Dutch Shell plc today announced the proposed settlement of
claims outside the US related to the 2004 restatement of
reserves," Shell said in an official statement to the London
Stock Exchange.


"Without admitting any wrongdoing, Shell agreed to pay 352.6
million, plus administrative costs, to investors covered by the
settlement."


The statement added: "Shell intends to offer the same
proportional settlement to investors in the US, provided the US
court overseeing the case approves."


The group downgraded its oil and gas reserves in 2004, triggering
an internal crisis that led to the historic merger of the energy
giant's two holding companies as it sought to restore investor
confidence.


In 2005, Shell moved to a more traditional single-board structure
with one chairman and one chief executive after scrapping its
dual-board arrangements based in Britain and the Netherlands.
