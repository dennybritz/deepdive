Israel is the "main obstacle" in striking a deal on a prisoner
exchange for a soldier captured by Palestinian militants, a
spokesman for Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya charged on
Wednesday.


"Israel is the main obstacle at reaching an accord on an exchange
of prisoners," Ghazi Hamad told AFP.


"With the position that it has adopted, Israel is confirming that
it does not want (Gilad) Shalit freed and does not want an
accord," he said, referring to an Israeli soldier seized by Gaza-
based militants, including the armed wing of Hamas, last June.


On Tuesday, Israel expressed "disappointment and reservations"
with the prisoners that Palestinians want freed in return for
Shalit, following Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's first meeting with
security chiefs to discuss the list.


Olmert will convene the security cabinet on Sunday to set
Israel's criteria for clearing prisoners for release, although
Israel has said it would not free prisoners "with blood on their
hands" -- those responsible for killing Israelis.


But Hamad said "there is no excuse to refuse the names presented
to Israel."


"In the past Israel has carried out prisoner exchanges with
Hezbollah members who had killed Israelis," he said, referring to
Lebanon's Shiite militia with which the Jewish state fought a
34-day war last summer.
