New Zealand's oldest person died late Tuesday at the age of 113
after a life which spanned three centuries.


Florence Finch's doctor said the British-born woman had strong
health until her final days, never taking any medication until
after she reached the age of 100.


"Her normal ritual was to get into bed and at the top of her
voice say her prayers for the next 20 or 30 minutes," Peter Foley
told New Zealand television.


Staff at the rest home in the North Island city of Hastings said
Finch would be sorely missed.


"We all loved her dearly. She was as sharp as a whip, we're going
to miss her immensely," said carer Michelle Sullivan.


Finch was born in Britain on December 22, 1893 and was married in
1915 before giving birth to twins in 1919.


Four years after her husband's death, she emigrated to New
Zealand in 1969 at the age of 76 to join her daughter and son-in-
law in Hawke's Bay, where she remained until her death.
