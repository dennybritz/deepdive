Warner Brothers International Cinemas, a subsidiary of the giant
American media company Time Warner, has sold its two cinemas in
China, a state press report said Wednesday.


The sale of theatres in Shanghai and neighbouring Nanjing were
the second of its kind this year after it sold three other
cinemas in the southern cities of Chongqing, Changsha and
Nanchang, the Shanghai Daily said.


Warner Brothers partner Shanghai Film will take over the US
group's 49 percent stake in the two cinemas, according to a
company statement released on Tuesday.


"We believe that as a leading player in China film industry,
Shanghai Film Group's experience in cinema operation will help to
achieve a smooth hand-over," said Millard Ochs, president of
Warner's cinema division.


Warner announced in November last year that it was pulling out of
cinema management in China after sudden regulatory changes issued
in 2005 prevented the group from taking a majority stake in its
partnerships.


In early 2004, Warner signed a deal with Chinese partners to run
30 Cineplex's in 15 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Nanning, Wuhan, Harbin, Dalian, Shenyang and Zhengzhou.


The Shanghai cinema opened in 2002 and topped all the country's
cinemas in box office sales, the newspapers said.


The takeover agreement was signed in February, but still requires
final government approval.
