Japanese share prices firmed slightly in morning trade on
Wednesday on the heels of Wall Street as investors set aside
jitters about upcoming company earnings, dealers said.


But they said buying was limited after a bigger-than-expected 5.2
percent fall in Japanese machinery orders in February -- a key
gauge of corporate capital spending.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 14.33 points or 0.08 percent to 17,679.02 by the lunch
break.


The broader TOPIX index of all first-section issues gained 3.44
points or 0.20 percent to 1,739.13.
