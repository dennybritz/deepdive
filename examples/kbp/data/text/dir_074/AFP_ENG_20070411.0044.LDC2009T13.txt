Crime in Malaysia has risen 10 percent so far this year, with
police blaming the rise on factors including an influx of
foreigners and moral decay among the young, reports said
Wednesday.


The crime index rose 10.6 percent in the first quarter of the
year compared to the same period in 2006, including a 23.7
percent spike in rape cases, the Star daily reported.


Malaysia's criminal investigations department director
Christopher Wan defended police performance, saying officers were
solving more crimes.


"Although the index has gone up, the solving rate stood at 38.2
percent, an increase over the 36.9 per cent achieved in January
to March 2006," he was quoted as saying by the state Bernama news
agency.


"People must trust the police. We are doing our best," he said.


Wan issued a list of reasons for the rise, including greater
reporting of crimes and what he said was an influx of foreigners
who contribute to serious crimes.


The rising cost of living is forcing wage-earners to turn to
criminal activity while people who migrate from rural to urban
areas are committing crimes to survive, he was reported saying.


Another reason is the "moral decline of youths. This has led to
the increase in the number of rape and murder cases," the New
Straits Times reported, citing Wan's list.


Wan could not be immediately reached for comment.


The figures follow news over the weekend that crime in the
capital Kuala Lumpur surged 40 percent in the first three months
of 2007, raising fears it could undermine a major tourism push in
Malaysia.
