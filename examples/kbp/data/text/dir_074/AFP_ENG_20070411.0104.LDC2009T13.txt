Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta is set to contest the runoff vote
in East Timor's presidential election against the ruling party's
Francisco Guterres, election officials said Wednesday.


Ramos-Horta, the tiny nation's current prime minister, had 22.6
percent of the vote with most of the ballots counted, behind the
powerful Fretilin party's Guterres, on 28.79 percent, the
national election commission said.


"The most probable result is Ramos-Horta will contest the second
round," said Martinho Gusmao, a commission spokesman.


The commission earlier said Guterres, popularly known as Lu-Olo,
was through to the May 8 runoff in East Timor's first
presidential election since independence in 2002.


The runoff is being held after no one candidate won a majority of
the vote.
