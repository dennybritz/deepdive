Officials were left red-faced Wednesday after a burst water pipe
forced Malaysia's immigration department to suspend services to
thousands of people and relocate foreign detainees.


Director-General of Immigration Wahid Mohamad Don said the
department had turned away 3,000 people after the accident in the
building, located in the administrative capital of Putrajaya.


"I am very disappointed with what's happening as we cannot
provide services to the public," Wahid was quoted as saying by
the state Bernama news agency.


Bernama said water from the pipe on the top floor of the seven-
storey building had flowed all the way down to the second floor,
while parts of the ceiling on the fifth floor had caved in.


Wahid said more than 600 officials had been sent to work
elsewhere, while 150 foreign nationals in detention were
relocated to immigration detention centres south of Kuala Lumpur
and at the capital's international airport.


The director of Putrajaya's public works department, Abdul Rahim
Ahmad, said his staff were repairing the pipe and blamed the
accident on lack of monitoring in the building, as well as poor
design and construction work.


The incident is "shameful because it affects services provided by
the government to the public," Abdul Rahim was quoted as saying.


Construction began in 1996 on the administrative centre south of
the capital under the administration of former premier Mahathir
Mohamad.


Built at an estimated 22 billion ringgit (6.37 billion dollars),
the project sparked criticism for excessive spending at the
height of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.
