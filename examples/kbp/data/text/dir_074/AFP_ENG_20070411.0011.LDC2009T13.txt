The husband of Philippine President Gloria Arroyo received a
blood transfusion and underwent dialysis Wednesday, a day after
major heart surgery, his doctor said.


Jose Miguel Arroyo, 60, remains under sedation during this
"really very critical" period but is responding to treatment, his
doctor Juliet Cervantes of Saint Luke's Hospital told reporters.


She said the president's husband had received a blood transfusion
and was undertaking continuous dialysis.


The overweight Arroyo underwent a 10-hour emergency heart
operation to repair a leak in the main artery and a triple bypass
of another artery early Tuesday morning.


The president has cancelled her public appointments to be at his
bedside.


Cervantes earlier said his admission to the hospital was a "close
call" and that any further delay might have killed him. Tests
showed there was already a leak in his aorta and that a blood
clot had been forming.


She warned that even after he recovers the president's husband
will have to follow a strict diet.
