Veteran point guard Gary Payton became the latest Miami Heat
player to be sidelined by injury on Tuesday, when the team
announced he will miss up to three weeks with a torn calf muscle.


Payton, a 16-year National Basketball Association veteran, was
hurt during practice on Monday.


He likely will not be available for the defending champion Heat's
first postseason series. The playoffs begin April 21.


The Heat have been ravaged by injuries this season, missing
superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Dwyane Wade, Jason Williams,
Jason Kapono and even coach Pat Riley at different points of the
season.


Payton, who suffered a groin injury on March 18, considered
sitting out the rest of the regular season but missed just two
games.


Re-signed by Miami to a one-year 1.2 million-dollar deal in
September, Payton averaged 5.3 points and 2.9 assists in 67
games.


A nine-time All-Star, Payton has averaged 16.9 points 6.9 assists
and 4.1 rebounds in 1,267 games with six different teams.
