Zimbabwe's annual rate of inflation was expected to touch the
2,000 percent mark when the latest figures are released by the
central statistical office on Wednesday.


Inflation has been on a roller-coaster ride since December 2004
when it shot up to 622.8 percent and now stands at 1,729.9
percent -- the highest rate in the world.


Victor Zirebgwa, an economist with the financial thinktank
Techfin Financial Research, said all indications were that the
upward spiral would continue.


"We expect inflation to be between 1,900 - 2,115 percent,"
Zirebgwa told AFP.


"The pressure is coming from imported inflation because most of
the basic goods we use in the country are imported.


"The importation of goods has a negative bearing because most of
the money used to buy these goods is sourced from the black
market."


The IMF has warned that inflation could end this year at over
4,000 percent.


Central bank governor Gideon Gono last month compared Zimbabwe's
inflation rate to the AIDS pandemic and warned it cannot be
tackled by government alone.
