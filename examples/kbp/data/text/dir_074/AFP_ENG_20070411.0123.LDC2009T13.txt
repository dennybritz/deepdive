Around 40 staff from the Italian aid organisation Emergency left
Kabul Wednesday, Italian radio RAI reported.


The move comes three days after the Taliban killed an Afghan
reporter kidnapped along with Italian journalist Daniele
Mastrogiacomo, and as an Emergency employee is believed to be
held by Afghan authorities.


RAI said 30 Italian and eight other foreign staff left Kabul on a
UN aircraft.


Mastrogiacomo was kidnapped last month. But Emergency, which has
worked in Afghanistan for 10 years, brokered his release on March
19 in exchange for the release of five Taliban militants by the
Afghan government.


Then on Sunday, the insurgents beheaded Afghan reporter Ajmal
Naqshbandi, captured along with Mastrogiacomo, after saying the
government had failed to meet demands to free two more rebels.


Rahmatullah Hanefi, the Afghan head of personnel at Emergency's
hospital in the southern city of Lashkar Gah who played a role in
freeing Mastrogiacomo, is believed to be held by the Afghan
secret service.
