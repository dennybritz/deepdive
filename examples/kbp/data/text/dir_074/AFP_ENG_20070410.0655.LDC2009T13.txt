Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro, in his third article in less
than two weeks, on Tuesday decried the conditional release from a
US jail of an anti-Castro militant wanted by Cuba and Venezuela
for the deadly downing of a Cuban jet.


A Texas judge allowed Luis Posada Carriles to walk free last
Friday pending a hearing on US immigration fraud charges, a
decision that Castro charged was taken under President George W.
Bush's "instructions."


"It was President Bush himself who ignored at all times the
criminal and terrorist side of the accused," Castro wrote in an
article titled "Brutal Response."


"He was protected by simply being charged with an immigration
violation," he wrote. "The response is brutal. The US government
and its most representative institutions decided to release the
monster early."


Castro has used the power of the pen recently to rile against
Washington, as he recovers from gastrointestinal surgery that
forced him to hand power to his brother Raul for the first time
eight months ago.
