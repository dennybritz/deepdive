North Korea will take initial steps to shut down its main nuclear
reactor within a day of receiving funds which had been frozen in
a Macau bank, a senior US official said Wednesday.


New Mexico state governor Bill Richardson said he was given the
assurance during his trip to Pyongyang this week at the head of a
US delegation.


"The North Korean government told us that with that (bank) issue
resolved, (it) would move promptly, within a day after receiving
the funds," Richardson told a press conference.


"And therefore, within that day (it would) invite the IAEA
inspectorate to Pyongyang to draft the terms for shutting down
the Yongbyon reactor."


North Korea expelled International Atomic Energy Agency
inspectors in late 2002 after the latest crisis over its nuclear
programme began.
