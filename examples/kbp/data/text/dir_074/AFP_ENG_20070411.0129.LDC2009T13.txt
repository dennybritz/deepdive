Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Wednesday he will
freeze his salary for five years and will "donate" the increase
that boosted his annual income to more than two million US
dollars.


His decision comes amid a furore over the hike in the city-state.


"I will hold my own salary at its present level for five years,"
the prime minister said in parliament.


Lee's salary was 1.62 million US dollars last year.


"The government will pay me my full pay because that is how the
system must work but for five years I will donate the increase in
my salary from this and subsequent revisions," he said.
