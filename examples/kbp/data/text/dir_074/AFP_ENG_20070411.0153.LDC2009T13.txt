Russia chided Iran on Wednesday for carrying out anti-aircraft
exercises in the immediate vicinity of a nuclear power station
being built by Russian engineers, Interfax news agency reported.


"The Russian embassy expressed bewilderment and asked that from
now on Russian specialists at Bushehr be informed in advance
about that type of activity," foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail
Kamynin was quoted as saying.


Kamynin said the live-fire air defence exercise took place Friday
"in the immediate vicinity" of the almost-completed nuclear power
station at Bushehr.


Russia's nuclear power agency, Rosatom, said the military
exercise "stirred up excessive tension around the site," RIA
Novosti news agency reported, citing a spokesman.


Bushehr is due to be Iran's first nuclear power station. Russia
has also sold Iran sophisticated weaponry, including 29 TOR-M1
anti-aircraft missile systems.


Washington is leading international pressure against Iran's
development of a nuclear power programme and says that Russia
should have cancelled the TOR-M1 sales because of the
international tensions.
