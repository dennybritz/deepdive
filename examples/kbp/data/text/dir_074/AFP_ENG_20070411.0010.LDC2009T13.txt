A philandering policeman in China has been jailed for life for
taking five million yuan (625,000 dollars) in bribes so he could
lavish his six mistresses with cash and gifts, state press said
Wednesday.


Xu Xiaogang, 56, former vice director of public security in
eastern China's Jiangxi province, was convicted by a court on
Monday of taking advantage of his post to seek personal benefits,
the Shanghai Daily reported.


The newspaper said Xu admitted to taking bribes from criminal
suspects under investigation between 1997 and 2005.


He then used that money to shower his mistresses in various
different cities with cash and gifts.


One woman involved with Xu was believed to have received more
than two million yuan.


The case is the latest incident of graft to dog China's ruling
Communist Party, which has said year after year that stamping out
official corruption is a top priority.


The issue is one of the top causes of public discontent in
booming China but, despite the string of recent high profile
arrests, the problem continues seemingly unabated.
