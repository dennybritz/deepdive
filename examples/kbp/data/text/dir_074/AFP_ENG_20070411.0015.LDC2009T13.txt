Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp. said Wednesday it will
jointly develop a uranium mine in Canada to supply the world's
growing number of nuclear power plants.


Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd., fully owned by Mitsubishi, and
Canada's CanAlaska Uranium Ltd. agreed to jointly undertake a
uranium exploration project in the Athabasca Basin in
northwestern Canada, the Japanese firm said.


The Athabasca Basin is the world's leading source of uranium,
producing about 30 percent of the global supply of primary
uranium, the company said.


Mitsubishi will invest about 11 million Canadian dollars (9.6
million US) into the project, in which the subsidiary has a 50
percent stake with CanAlaska holding the rest, the company said.


"Global uranium demand is expected to grow strongly with the
increase in the number of global nuclear reactors, which are
considered environmentally friendly," the company said in a
statement.


"The project aims for a stable supply of uranium product for
nuclear power generators and thus contributes to the prevention
of further global warming."


The United States is ending a moratorium on building nuclear
reactors. But in Japan, government hopes to build more nuclear
reactors have been set back by public concerns about safety.


Resource-poor Japan relies on nuclear generation for some 30
percent of its electricity with annual uranium consumption of
about 8,700 tons a year.


Japan imports nearly all of its oil from the Middle East.
