Five people were killed in clashes between political rivals in
southwestern Nigerian town of Ibadan, police said Wednesday.


"We were able to recover five bodies from Moniya, the scene of
the fracas between supporters of the PDP (People's Democratic
Party) and the Labour Party," a senior police officer told AFP.


He said trouble broke out on Tuesday during an election campaign
rally organised by Labour Party to drum up support for its
candidates in Saturday's governorship and state house of assembly
polls.


Witness Bayo Ajani told AFP several people were also injured in
the violence before the police could contain it.


"It was the quick intervention of the police that saved the day,"
he said.


Tensions are rising in Nigeria ahead of this month's key vote to
choose a successor to President Olusegun Obasanjo, who steps down
after 16 years in power on May 29.


State governorship and state assembly polls are scheduled for
April 14 while presidential and National Assembly elections are
fixed for April 21.
