Bangladesh's cricket chiefs have signed a  two-year deal with
world champions Australia to help them raise the standard of the
game in the South Asian nation, an official said on Wednesday.


Cricket Australia will train Bangladeshi coaches, prepare a
coaching manual, set up an umpires' management system and train
young players at Australian academies, Bangladesh Cricket Board
(BCB) chief executive Mahmudur Rahman said.


"It will be a huge boost to our cricket and we hope our cricket
will reach a higher level because of Australian help," Rahman
said, adding the BCB will pay Cricket Australia 427,500 dollars
for its services.


Under a previous five-year agreement that expired in 2006, young
Bangladeshi cricketers had trained under Australian coaches.


Local experts credit Australian coaching for Bangladesh's recent
improvement on the international stage, including stunning wins
over India and South Africa in the ongoing World Cup.


Dav Whatmore, a former Australian Test player and ex-coach of Sri
Lanka, is currently coaching the Bangladesh national team, which
has qualified for the Super Eights stage of the World Cup.


Whatmore's tenure ends after the World Cup amid speculation he
may be one of the candidates to replace another Australian, Greg
Chappell, in India.
