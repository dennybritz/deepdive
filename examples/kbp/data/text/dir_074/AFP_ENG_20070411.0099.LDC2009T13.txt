Hong Kong share prices closed 0.50 percent higher Wednesday as
another record finish on China's A-share bourses helped the
market reverse modest losses earlier due to profit-taking,
dealers said.


China stocks, notably financials, led the gains while local
property plays and blue chips were weak ahead of the release of
US Federal Reserve meeting minutes later Wednesday and key US
inflation data in the next few days.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 101.56 points at 20,449.43, off a
low of 20,278.84 and a high of 20,502.17. Turnover was 59.07
billion Hong Kong dollars (7.6 billion US).
