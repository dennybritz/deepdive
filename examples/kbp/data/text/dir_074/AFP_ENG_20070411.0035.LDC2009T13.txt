New Zealand share prices closed 0.80 percent lower Wednesday as
the prospect of further interest rate rises dampened sentiment,
dealers said.


The benchmark NZX-50 gross index fell 33.11 points to 4,147.36 on
turnover worth 133.5 million dollars (97.6 million US).


Brokers said possible factors in the fall of leading stocks were
a lull in corporate news and the spectre of another interest rate
rise.


"We had a very strong employment figure out. There doesn't seem
to be an easing in sight with regards to interest rates," said
James Smalley, client adviser at Hamilton, Hindin, Greene.


"That's also reflected in our dollar being very strong as well,
which I think is probably affecting the overall market."


Figures out on Wednesday showed a further decline in the number
of people on unemployment benefits and a business survey a day
earlier showed many businesses expected continuing inflationary
pressures.


These pressures may encourage the central bank to raise interest
rates again later this month.


Market leader Telecom fell six cents to 4.69 dollars amid
concerns the company may not return as much to shareholders as
expected after the sale of its Yellow Pages business.


Contact Energy fell 19 cents to 9.08 dollars and Fletcher
Building was down 11 cents at 11.39.


Discount retailer The Warehouse rose six cents to 7.06 dollars
and casino operator Sky City fell two cents to 4.69.


Fisher & Paykel Appliances fell a cent to 3.69 dollars and
sister company Fisher & Paykel Healthcare was down five cents
at 3.66. Air New Zealand rose four cents to 2.38 dollars.
