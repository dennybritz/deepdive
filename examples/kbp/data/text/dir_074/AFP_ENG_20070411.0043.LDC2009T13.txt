All Nippon Airways, Japan's second-largest airline, said some 15
percent of its domestic flights were cancelled Wednesday after
crew members went on a one-day strike.


Negotiations broke down early Wednesday between the airline and
the unions, which demanded better labour conditions and
inspections of Bombardier planes involved in recent mishaps.


The strike led to the cancellation of 136 domestic flights, or
about 15 percent of ANA's total domestic flights Wednesday,
affecting about 6,500 passengers, the company said.


Another 42 domestic flights were expected to be delayed
throughout the day, affecting about 2,200 passengers, ANA said.


"Once the unions enter a strike, it usually goes on for 24
hours," said an ANA spokesman.


"It won't be lifted at least until midnight (1500 GMT)," he said.


But the airline will resume its usual operation after the strike,
he added.


The unions had been demanding better training programmes for the
airline's crew members.


The labour side had also demanded better inspections for
Canadian-made Bombardier passenger planes after one of ANA's 13
Bombardier DHC-8 suffered a landing gear problem last month.


The aircraft failed to lower its front wheel and skidded down the
runway on its nose upon landing at Kochi airport in southwestern
Japan. No one was injured in the widely televised belly landing.


ANA temporarily suspended use of the planes for inspections but
they are now back in operation.


The airline has not yet given answers to the unions' demands on
the DHC-8 planes, said Keiko Ninomiya, another ANA spokeswoman.


ANA's international flights were operating as normal.
