Iraqi civilians are facing an "ever-worsening crisis" as the
humanitarian and security situation in the country deteriorates,
the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Wednesday.


"It's clear for us that the humanitarian situation is steadily
worsening and affecting in one way or another, directly or
indirectly, all Iraqis today," said the ICRC's director of
operations, Pierre Kraehenbuehl.


"Protecting Iraq's civilian population is a major priority and
should be everyone's priority," he told journalists.


The ICRC urged all those involved in the conflict, both state and
non-state actors, to urgently respect international humanitarian
law and not target civilians.


Kraehenbuehl said the worsening security situation was causing
"overlapping effects" of hardship for the civilian population,
with medical care deteriorating as doctors flee the country.


The Iraqi health ministry estimates that half of the country's
doctors have left, he said.


In addition, many injured people do not even seek out medical
treatment as they do not wish to leave their families for fear of
either being kidnapped en route or in hospital, or leaving their
relatives in a vulnerable situation, he added.


"The suffering that Iraqi men, women and children are enduring
today is unbearable and unacceptable. Their lives and dignity are
continuously under threat," Kraehenbuehl said.


"Much more has to be done" by all parties, including US and other
foreign troops, to improve the situation and ensure that
civilians' rights are respected, he added.
