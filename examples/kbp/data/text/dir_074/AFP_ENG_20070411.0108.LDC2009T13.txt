Diego Maradona has left hospital, Argentine press reported on
Wednesday, where he spent the last 13 days recovering from
hepatitis caused by excessive drinking.


The 46-year-old 1986 World Cup winner left hospital on Wednesday
several minutes after midnight, the Telam agency reported.


Doctors have prescribed him drugs and given him diet sheets to
help him on his way to recovery.


Maradona, retired from football since 1997, had been in the
Guemes clinic in Buenos Aires since March 28.


In 2000, Maradona had a heart attack in Uruguay following a
cocaine overdose. Four years later, another heart attack followed
another overdose.


After growing overweight, he underwent gastric bypass surgery in
2005 to reduce the amount of food he consumes.
