Thailand's army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont is in
good health and set to be discharged after three days in hospital
for medical tests, officials said Wednesday.


Surayud was hospitalised Monday for an unscheduled medical check-
up, amid increasing political tension in Bangkok and rumours that
he might resign.


"Everything is fine and no serious illness was found. He could be
discharged by Thursday, but that's up to him," Major General
Parinya Thaweechaikarn, his personal physician, told reporters.


"The prime minister has started eating mild food after eating
only clear soup for two days," he said.


While resting at hospital, Surayud has dealt with paperwork and
received regular reports on government affairs from his
secretary, Parinya said.


Government spokesman Yongyuth Mayalarp said Surayud was scheduled
to return to work Thursday, when he was also expected to speak to
reporters.


Surayud's aides have roundly rejected any suggestion that he
might resign, and denied suggestions of a split between the
premier and Thailand's junta leader Sonthi Boonyaratglin.


Surayud, a former army chief, was installed after the military
ousted elected premier Thaksin Shinawatra in a September coup.


Although many in Bangkok welcomed the coup, Surayud's popularity
has steadily fallen in polls.
