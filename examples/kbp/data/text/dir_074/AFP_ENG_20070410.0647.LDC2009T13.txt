Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Tuesday decried in a new article the
conditional release from a US jail of an anti-Castro militant
wanted by Cuba and Venezuela over the deadly downing of a Cuban
jet.


A Texas judge allowed Luis Posada Carriles to walk free last
Friday pending a hearing on US immigration fraud charges, a
decision that Castro charged was taken under President George W.
Bush's "instructions."
