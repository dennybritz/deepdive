Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz has instructed security
authorities to evict Jewish settlers who occupied a house in the
flashpoint West Bank town of Hebron, his office said Wednesday.


Peretz instructed the army's civil administration in the West
Bank "to evict the settlers who had entered the building in
Hebron without permission," it said in a statement.


No date has been set for the evacuation, which officials fear
could spark violent clashes between security forces and right-
wing activists in the town.


Dozens of hardline settlers took over the house on March 19
claiming that they had bought it -- a charge rejected as a lie by
the Palestinian owners.


The defence minister's decision follows a legal assessment handed
by attorney general Menachem Mazuz, who said that the building
was unlawfully populated, the statement said.


About 200 Jewish settlers moved in to the three-storey building
on a road linking Hebron to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.


Hebron has long been a flashpoint between Palestinians and
Israelis. Under an agreement with the Palestinian Authority,
Israel evacuated 80 percent of Hebron in 1997, leaving a
settlement of several hundred Jewish settlers, protected by its
soldiers, around the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a site holy to both
Jews and Muslims.
