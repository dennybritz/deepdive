Masked gunmen in the volatile Gaza Strip on Wednesday shot dead a
Palestinian police officer loyal to the moderate Fatah movement,
medical sources said.


Tahsin al-Jaldan, 32, of the preventive security forces, died of
his wounds several hours after he was shot in the town of Khan
Yunis in southern Gaza, the sources said.


Another preventive security member was shot and seriously injured
in a separate overnight incident in northern Gaza, medical
sources said.


The impoverished Gaza Strip has been plagued in recent months by
violent clashes between forces loyal to Palestinian president
Mahmud Abbas's Fatah and the Islamist Hamas movements, which
nevertheless subsided after a power-sharing government was formed
last month.
