The US space agency said Tuesday it could launch the space
shuttle Atlantis as early as June 8, after its takeoff was
delayed last month following hail damage to the orbiter's
external fuel tank.


The shuttle is expected to launch some time between June 8 and
July 17 after repairs were completed to hail damage, incurred
during a strong Florida thunderstorm, that experts said was the
worst they had ever seen.


"Based on the discussions we had today, I would say the
confidence is high that we would fly in that June/July window,"
said Wayne Hale, manager of the Space Shuttle Program.


Repairs and inspections showed positive results, he said.


"The technical team, the independence review team, all express a
high degree of confidence we can come to a positive outcome,"
Hale said.


The storm swept the Cape Canaveral, Florida, area in February,
pelting the shuttle with hail as it sat at a Kennedy Space Center
launch pad, being prepared for a mission to the orbiting
International Space Station (ISS).


If for some reason the shuttle could not take off in June or
July, the next window of opportunity would begin August 5, Hale
said.


The Atlantis mission is aimed at continuing construction of the
ISS.


During the last shuttle mission to the ISS, in December,
Discovery astronauts rewired the outpost's power system and
continued constructing the station by installing a truss segment
on its grid-like structure.
