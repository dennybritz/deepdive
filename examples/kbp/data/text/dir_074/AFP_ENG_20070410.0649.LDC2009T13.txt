East Timor's presidential election was Wednesday headed for a
second round of voting after three candidates were neck and neck
with 70 percent of ballots counted, officials said.


The tiny nation's prime minister, Jose Ramos-Horta, was
fractionally ahead after garnering 21.75 percent of the overall
vote, said the National Election Commission.


However Fernando "Lasama" de Araujo, chairman of the opposition
Democrat Party, was right behind with 21.73 percent and the
candidate of the ruling Fretilin party, Francisco "Lu-Olo"
Guterres, was third with 21.39 percent.


The three-way split almost certainly means there will be a second
round run-off between the leading two candidates on May 8.


East Timorese turned out in large numbers to vote in Monday's
election to choose a replacement for Xanana Gusmao, the former
guerrilla leader who was elected to the largely ceremonial post
before independence in 1992.


Observers said the vote was orderly and fair, despite fears of
violence, allegations of voter intimidation and last-minute
scrambles for ballot papers.


The peaceful vote was hailed a success for a country that saw
years of bloodshed under Indonesian rule after 1974, and an orgy
of killing as it voted for independence in a UN-sponsored
referendum in 1999.


The vote followed a turbulent year in East Timor. Foreign
peacekeepers arrived in May to quell violence that left at least
37 people dead and forced more than 150,000 people to flee their
homes.
