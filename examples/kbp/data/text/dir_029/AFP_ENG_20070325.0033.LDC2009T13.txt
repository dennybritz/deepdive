Taiwan confirmed Sunday that its foreign minister had met leaders
in St Lucia, a Chinese ally, on a trip likely to signal a new
round of diplomatic jousting between Taipei and Beijing.


China regards Taiwan as a rogue province awaiting reunification,
even by force if needed, and opposes any official exchanges
between its allies and officials from the island.


The trip by Foreign Minister James Huang is "an indication that
the diplomatic tug-of-war across the (Taiwan) Strait has
intensified," said a foreign ministry official who asked not to
be named.


"This is a rare case when Taiwan's foreign minister is invited to
publicly visit China's diplomatic ally," he said.


Ministry spokesman David Wang confirmed that Huang had met St
Lucia's Prime Minister John Compton and members of his cabinet
since Huang's arrival on Friday.


"The atmosphere of the meeting was friendly," Wang said.


Taiwan and China, which split in 1949 at the end of a civil war,
have accused each other of using money to lure the other's allies
with so-called "chequebook diplomacy".


"St Lucia is playing the Taiwan card," said Liu Bi-rung, a
professor of political science at Soochow University. "It seems
to be telling Beijing, 'Look, here comes Taipei. You'd better up
your ante.'"


Taiwan and St Lucia opened diplomatic relations in 1984 when
Compton was prime minister. Taipei severed ties in 1997 when
prime minister Kenny Anthony switched recognition to Beijing.
Compton was elected late last year.


Only 24 countries recognise Taipei instead of Beijing. The last
to switch was Chad, which moved recognition to Beijing in August.
