US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Sunday urged Arab
states to exert maximum efforts towards reaching a peace
settlement with Israel.


"I would hope that every state would search very deep to see what
it can do at this crucial time to finally end this conflict," she
said after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.


She made her remarks during a joint press conference with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit in the southern city
of Aswan, three days before an Arab summit in Riyadh.


"The Palestinian people have waited long enough to have a state
of their own and the Israeli people have waited long enough to
have the kind of security that will come from the establishment
of a stable and democratic neighbour to live in peace with," she
said.


On the first leg of a tour of the Middle East, Rice met Saturday
with the foreign ministers and intelligence chiefs of the so-
called "Arab quartet," which includes Egypt, Jordan, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.


Rice, who has been hoping to revive a long-dormant plan for a
broad Arab-Israeli peace floated by Saudi Arabia five years ago,
said the discussions were "excellent".
