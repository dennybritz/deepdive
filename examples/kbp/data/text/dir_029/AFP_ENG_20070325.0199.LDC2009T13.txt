New Zealand have been given permission to replace injured seamer
Daryl Tuffey with Chris Martin at the World Cup.


Martin replaces his fellow fast bowler after medical reports
indicated that Tuffey suffered a serious injury to his right
bicep during the Black Caps' 114-run win against Canada in St
Lucia on Thursday.


Martin is the fifth replacement player to be called up for the
tournament.


Australia's Stuart Clark, who replaced Brett Lee (ankle) and the
Pakistan trio of Azhar Mahmood, Mohammad Sami and Yasir Arafat,
who came in for Abdul Razzaq (knee), Shoaib Akhtar (hamstring and
knee) and Mohammed Asif (elbow) were the other players to be
called up to replace original nominations.


New Zealand's next match in the World Cup is against West Indies
in Antigua on Thursday.
