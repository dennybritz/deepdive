Nigeria coach Berti Vogts has said he was disappointed with his
team's overall performance in his first game in charge even
though they won by the odd goal against Uganda in an African
Nations Cup qualifier.


"I was not happy with the first half. We did not play very well,"
said the German coach, who before the game had called on Nigeria
to win in style against the visiting Ugandans.


"We had a better second half but overall, it was not very good."


Uganda held out against their star-studded hosts till the 75th
minute when Portsmouth striker Nwankwo Kanu scrambled home for
the match winner.


The Cranes of Uganda also had a goal in stoppage time overruled
by Senegalese referee Diatta Badara for an infringement.


"We played against a very good and organised Ugandan team," said
Vogts, whose next competitive game will be against the same team
in Kampala in early June.


Vogts signed a four-year contract with Nigeria in February and he
is expected to qualify the Super Eagles for next year's African
Nations Cup in Ghana and also the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.


Uganda coach Lazslo Csaba said the Senegalese referee had robbed
his team of at least a draw.


"This was a draw. Against Niger in another Nations Cup tie, we
had a Senegalese referee and we played against that referee. It
was the same thing against Nigeria," he said.


"There were two very good teams playing football but the referee
was not good."


Nigeria maintain their leadership of Group Three of the
qualifying tournament with nine points from three matches while
Uganda are five points adrift.


The winner of the group, which also includes Lesotho and Niger,
will automatically qualify for the 2008 Nations Cup in January .
