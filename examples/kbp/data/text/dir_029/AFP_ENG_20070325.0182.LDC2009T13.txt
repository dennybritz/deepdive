South African President Thabo Mbeki telephoned Zimbabwean
counterpart Robert Mugabe following the escalating campaign
against opposition members in Zimbabwe, media reports said
Sunday.


The Sunday Times newspaper said Mbeki, who has been widely
critised for his low key reaction to the political and economic
crisis in Zimbabwe, telephoned Mugabe recently.


It was believed to be the second such direct contact since the
two last met in Ghana during the country's 50th independence
commemoration earlier this month.


The paper quoted a senior government official who declined to say
when Mugabe and Mbeki spoke and what was discussed.


The two countries' deputy presidents Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and
Joyce Mujuru met Friday in Johannesburg.


Senior South African government members also held talks with the
secretary- general of Zimbabwe's divided Movement for Democratic
Change, the paper reported.


Western countries, especially Britain and the United States, have
vociferously criticised a violent crackdown on the opposition,
while Mbeki's South Africa refrained from outright condemnation,
insisting that Zimbabwe be allowed to chart its own destiny.


The 83-year-old Mugabe on Saturday urged supporters to gear up
for presidential and parliamentary polls next year, a move seen
by analysts as bowing down to pressure within his ruling Zanu-PF
opposed to him ruling until 2010.
