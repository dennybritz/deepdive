A Canadian woman was allegedly  raped by a Hindu holy man or
"sadhu" in the northern pilgrimage city of Varanasi, a report
said Sunday.


The 24-year-old was found unconscious at a guesthouse late
Saturday after she was allegedly raped by the "sadhu," the Press
Trust of India news agency quoted police official M.P. Tiwari as
saying.


The woman told police she was sexually assaulted when she
regained consciousness, Tiwari was quoted saying.


She was to undergo a medical examination, Tiwari said, adding the
police had detained the "sadhu" for questioning.
