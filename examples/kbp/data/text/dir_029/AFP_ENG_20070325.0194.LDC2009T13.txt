Lornah Kiplagat will not defend her world cross country title
next year in Edinburgh announced the Kenyan-born naturalised
Dutch runner.


The 32-year-old 20 kilometres world road race champion said she
wanted to focus on marathon running from now on and her first
target is the London Marathon on April 22.


"That was my last cross country and now I intend to focus on road
racing and marathons," said Kiplagat, who ended up as a
convincing 26second winner over defending champion Tirunesh
Dibaba of Ethiopia.


Kiplagat, who became a Dutch citizen in 2003 after marrying coach
Pieter Langerhorst, has returned to her training camp in Iten,
near to the Rift Valley, to prepare for the London race.


Kiplagat became the first European to be crowned world cross
country long race champion since Britain's Paula Radcliffe in
2002.
