British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that the Iranian
capture of 15 British navy personnel was "unjustified and wrong"
and insisted they had not strayed into Iranian waters.


"The quicker it is resolved, the easier it is for all. But it is
quite unjustified and wrong," he told reporters on the sidelines
of EU 50th anniversary celebrations in Berlin.


"They were in Iraqi water, it is not true that they went into
Iranian territorial waters," Blair insisted, in what were his
first public comments on the seizure of the navy staff on Friday.


The 14 men and one woman were seized on the Shatt al-Arab
waterway that divides Iraq and Iran.


Britain says they were conducting "routine" anti-smuggling
operations. Iran said Saturday that the group has admitted to
illegally entering Iranian waters.


Blair said he hoped the issue would be resolved in "an as easy
and diplomatic way as possible," and he added: "I hope the
Iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is
for us."
