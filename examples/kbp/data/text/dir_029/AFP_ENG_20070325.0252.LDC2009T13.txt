Polish President Lech Kaczynski said Sunday it was "unrealistic"
to expect a new EU treaty to be adopted before 2009 to revive the
stalled constitutional process.


"It is perhaps a beautiful target, but it seems unreleastic to
me," Kazcynski told Polish reporters after the EU summit to mark
the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.


The president said the 27 member EU might agree the wording of a
treaty by 2009 but that it could not come into force before 2011.


Germany sought to use a special declaration issued for the
anniversary to set a 2009 deadline -- before European elections
are held -- to agree a new treaty on strengthening EU
institutions.
