British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that the Iranian
capture of 15 British navy personnel was "unjustified and wrong"
and insisted they had not strayed into Iranian waters.


"The quicker it is resolved, the easier it is for all. But it is
quite unjustified and wrong," he told reporters on the sidelines
of EU 50th anniversary celebrations in Berlin.
