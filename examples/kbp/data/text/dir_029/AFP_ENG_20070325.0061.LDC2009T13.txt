Former Red Army faction militant Brigitte Mohnhaupt, who was
deemed Germany's most dangerous woman in the 1970s, has been
freed after 24 years in jail, a justice official said on Sunday.


Mohnhaupt, who was convicted for her role in nine murders, was
released on parole from a prison in southern Germany in the early
hours of the morning, Wolfgang Deuschl said.
