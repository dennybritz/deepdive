Ten people died when a "fire show" in a ground-floor nightclub in
central Moscow apparently went wrong, engulfing the room with
smoke, officials said Sunday.


"As a result of the fire, 10 people, including a Bulgarian
national, died and we are working on their identification," the
city's deputy prosecutor Vladimir Poneversky was quoted as saying
by the RIA Novosti news agency.


A spokesman for the emergency situations ministry said a 20-year-
old barman had told rescue workers that the blaze started when a
nightly "fire show" being performed by a waiter at the club using
spirits went wrong.


"The waiter's clothing caught fire, after which the flame spread
to a five-litre container with spirits and then the stage caught
fire," the spokesman, Yevgeny Bobylev, was quoted by the Interfax
news agency as saying.


Poneversky said the fire had started near the bar and quickly
engulfed the club with carbon monoxide, killing people on the
spot. Moscow prosecutors have launched an investigation into fire
safety at the club.
