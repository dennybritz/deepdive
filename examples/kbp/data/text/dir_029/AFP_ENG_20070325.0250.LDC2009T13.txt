More than one million Palestinians are dependent on a European
Union aid mechanism set up to bypass the Hamas-led government
which is boycotted by the West, a senior EU official said Sunday.


"In total, over 150,000 heads of households receive financial
support from the temporary international mechanism," the official
said.


"With an estimated household size of six, more than one million
people have benefited from the mechanism," he added.


According to EU figures, the funding mechanism has so far
mobilized 300 million euros (400 million dollars) and will reach
a total of 700 million euros (930 million dollars).


The official said the mechanism covers 88 percent of the wages of
non-security staff on the Palestinian Authority payroll including
doctors, nurses and teachers.


"No matter how much international support the Palestinian
Authority gets it will still be very far from paying the full
wages to its employees until Israel releases the tax funds," he
added.


Israel has refused to turn over tens of millions of dollars in
tax revenues collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority
since Hamas took power last March.
