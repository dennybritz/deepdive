Russia's Gleb Galperin ended China's domination of the diving
boards Sunday, winning the 10m platform world title ahead of Zhou
Luxin.


Galperin amassed 554.70 points to upset Zhou who finished second
with 519.15. Zhou's Chinese teammate Lin Yue was third with
513.70.


China had won seven out of seven diving gold here before Galperin
spoiled their party.


Zhou had comfortably led through the preliminary rounds, looking
odds-on to claim the title.


But Galperin was bubbling with confidence after scoring a perfect
10 for his fifth dive in the semis earlier in the day and took an
early grip.


Zhou performed a flawless final dive, scoring 102 points, in a
bid to rein in the Russian but it was to no avail.


Canadian superstar Alexandre Despatie was eighth.
