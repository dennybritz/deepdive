European Union leaders adopted Sunday a 50th anniversary
declaration setting 2009 as the deadline for preparing a new
treaty, following the failure of the bloc's constitution.


The "Berlin Declaration", which marks the signing on March 25,
1957 of the founding Treaty of Rome, was signed in the German
capital by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the heads of the
European Commission and parliament.
