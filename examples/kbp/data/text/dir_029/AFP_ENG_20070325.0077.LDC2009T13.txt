Thousands of South Korean farmers and anti-globalisation
activists marched here Sunday in a rally against free trade talks
with the United States.


Wearing red headbands, the protesters urged the government to
scrap negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) and put the
issue to a public referendum.


"Stop the South Korea-US FTA, which threatens the livelihood of
our people," they said in a statement.


Organisers said about 10,000 people participated in the rally on
a park outside the Seoul city hall. Police put the number at
7,500.


About 15,000 riot police armed with water cannon maintained tight
security around an intersection leading to the US embassy as the
protesters started a march.


South Korea and the United States will meet in Seoul Monday to
seek a final deal after 10 months of tough negotiations.


The deal, if agreed, would be the biggest since the 1993 North
American Free Trade Agreement. US-South Korean bilateral trade
reached 74 billion dollars in 2006.
