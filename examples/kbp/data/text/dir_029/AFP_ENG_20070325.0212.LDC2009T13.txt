Seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher is set
to be honoured at the German Grand Prix by having a corner named
in his honour it was revealed on Sunday.


The now retired German driving legend will be present at the race
at the Nurburgring on July 22 for the unveiling of the corner
which will be called 'Schumacher S'.


"Michael Schumacher will be here when we unveil the 'Schumacher
S', announced Walter Kafitz, the director of the racetrack.


"Schumacher is the greatest driver in the history of German
motorsport.


"He already has an entertainment room named after him, and has
received our highest honour, the golden ring of Nurburg.


"Thus it was imperative we did something even more prestigious to
honour him," added Kafitz.


Schumacher, who retired at the end of the 2006 season, was
delighted with the latest honour to be bestowed on him.


"I am very proud of this honour which they have given me," said
Schumacher, who won at the Nurburgring on five occasions.


Schumacher will also drive a lap of honour before the German
Grand Prix and will be the first driver to round the
Schumacher-S.
