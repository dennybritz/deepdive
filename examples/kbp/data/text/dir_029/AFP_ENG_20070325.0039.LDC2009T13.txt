Germany's Britta Kamrau-Corestein carved out a piece of history
Sunday when she became the joint most prolific open water swimmer
by claiming the gruelling women's 25km title.


Kamrau-Corestein had a lead of four minutes when the race was
suspended at the halfway point due to strong winds and big waves
on Saturday and she held on when it restarted Sunday.


The German was able to maintain her distance from a chasing pack
of four swimmers throughout almost three hours of racing to win
by two minutes and 27 seconds from America's Kalyn Keller and
Russia's Ksenia Popova.


It brought her level with the now retired Edith van Dijk of the
Netherlands as the leading world championship medal winner with
14. She has won six gold, two silver and six bronze.


In the men's event, Russia's Yury Kudinov powered through the
cold water of Port Phillip Bay to outpace Italy's Marco
Formentini and Egypt's Mohamed Zanaty and win in five hours, 16
minutes and 45 seconds.


He crossed the finish line more than two minutes ahead of
Formentini.


"All the competitors wanted this and it was a very heavy race
because the weather is not good and the water is cold," said the
Russian.


"I'm very happy because I swam my first world championship here
in Australia (Perth) nine years ago and now I have won here.


"I felt so strong but our race was hard work and looking at other
sportsmen who I saw behind, yes, I was scared. I swam the last
three or four laps very fast."


Of the six open water gold medals decided here Russia has won
four and Germany two.
