Armed robbers stole 820,000 euros (1.1 million dollars) from a
casino in Brussels early Sunday, authorities said.


The robbery took less than five minutes, prosecutor Eric Dehon
said, adding that no one had been injured in the heist.


Shortly after 4:00 am (0200 GMT), four men dressed in black and
wearing hoods entered the casino in the centre of Brussels
brandishing handguns and rifles, including one machine gun.


While two of them stood guard over the dozen or so people still
in the casino, two others emptied cash registers and a safe.


They then fled in what may have been a stolen taxi that appeared
to be driven by a fifth accomplice, according to a preliminary
investigation.


The escape was caught on surveillance cameras.


Brussels police were searching for the robbers.
