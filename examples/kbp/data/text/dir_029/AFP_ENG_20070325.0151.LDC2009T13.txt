German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged European Union leaders
Sunday to back tougher sanctions against Sudan over the crisis in
Darfur, where an estimated 200,000 people have been killed.


"I want to state frankly that we have to consider stronger
sanctions," she said in Berlin during 50th anniversary
celebrations of the European Union's founding Treaty of Rome.


The European Union imposed an arms embargo on Khartoum in January
2004.


"On a day like today we also think of the people in Zimbabwe and
Darfur. The suffering there is unbearable," she told EU leaders.


"We want to take this opportunity to call updon Sudan's President
(Omar) Beshir to finally comply with UN resolutions," she said.


British Prime Minister Tony Blair has also called for tougher
sanctions.


The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when an ethnic minority rose
up against the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum, which then
enlisted the Janjaweed militia to help crush the rebellion.


The United States has already said it will seek a United Nations
resolution aimed at forcing Khartoum to let a UN-led peacekeeping
force into Darfur.


Beshir, who earlier this month backtracked on an agreement to let
20,000 UN-led peacekeepers into the region, accuses the West of
wanting to invade his country and plunder its resources.


According to UN figures, some 200,000 people have been killed and
at least two million have been displaced in the four-year civil
war.


On Saturday, 10 leading European writers and thinkers called on
the EU leaders to impose tough new sanctions on Sudan instead of
marking the anniversary of the Treaty of Rome with lavish
celebrations in Germany.
