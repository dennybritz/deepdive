An Indian and a Lebanese man kidnapped in volatile southern
Nigeria last week amid disputes over oil revenues have been
released, a diplomatic source said.


Gunmen seized the construction workers from a building site at
Agbarho in Delta State on Friday, police said earlier.


No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the
latest in a series of such attacks against foreigners mainly
involved in the oil industry.
