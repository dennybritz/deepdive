China's Guo Jingjing won a record fourth consecutive 3m
springboard world title on Sunday, beating her teammate Wu Minxia
who finished second.


No other diver in the history of the world championships has
managed to win four titles in the same event.


Guo was in a class of her own throughout the preliminary rounds
and in the final to keep China on track for a clean sweep of all
10 diving golds here.


China have now won seven gold with Zhou Luxin diving later Sunday
in the men's 10m platform final.


The photogenic 25-year-old reigning Olympic champion scored
381.75 points.


Wu, Guo's customary strongest rival for the gold medal, recovered
from a poor qualifying session to easily finish second with
368.80.


Italy's Tania Cagnotto was third with 341.70.
