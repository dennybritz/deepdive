Japan's earthquake early-warning system swung into action for the
first time on Sunday as a huge tremor struck, allowing
authorities to issue a tsunami alert about one minute later.


The system detects the first underground tremors that come before
the main quake and estimates their intensity before big seismic
waves reach the surface.


"That's why we could issue the alert in a minute," said Yosuke
Igarashi, an official at the meteorological agency.


"We started operation of the early-warning system last year, but
until now there was no opportunity to use it to issue a tsunami
warning," he said.


Before the new system was introduced it usually took the agency
about three minutes to issue a tsunami alert after a major quake.


The 6.9-magnitude quake occurred at around 9:42 am (0042 GMT) in
Ishikawa prefecture, about 300 kilometres (200 miles) northwest
of the capital Tokyo, killing one person and injuring at least
170 others, officials said.


The tsunami warning urging residents to head to higher ground on
the Noto peninsula facing the Sea of Japan (East Sea) was lifted
after about two hours.


The system for tsunami alerts was introduced in October,
officials said.


Japan, which endures 20 percent of the world's major tremors,
prides itself on having one of the world's most accurate systems
for assessing earthquakes and predicting tsunamis.
