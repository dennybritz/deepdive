Armenian Prime Minister Andranik Margarian, leader of the ruling
Republican party, has died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the
government told AFP on Sunday.


Margarian, 55, had been in office in this former Soviet republic
since 2000. Previously he was a parliamentary deputy in the 1990s
and served in different government departments in Soviet times.


A trained engineer, Margarian was arrested for anti-Soviet
dissident activity in 1974 and sentenced to two years in prison,
according to his official biography.
