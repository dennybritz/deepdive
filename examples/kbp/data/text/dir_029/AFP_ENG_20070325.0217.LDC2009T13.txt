Italy's seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi celebrated his
85th career win but first for six races here on Sunday as he won
the Spanish MotoGP.


The flamboyant 28-year-old Yamaha rider spoilt the hopes of the
138,000 home fans as he beat home Spaniard Dani Pedrosa, riding a
Honda, while American Colin Edwards was third, also on a Yamaha.


Rossi, who last won in Malaysia in September 2006, dominated the
race leading from start to finish as Pedrosa failed to take
advantage of his pole position.


Australia's Casey Stoner, who won the opener in Qatar, never got
into the mix and finished fifth.
