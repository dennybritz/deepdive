Iraqi police averted a new chemical attack in an Al-Qaeda hotbed
by arresting the would-be suicide bomber whose dirty bomb of
explosives and chlorine failed to detonate, the US military said
Sunday.


The would-be bomber was detained and the truck that was rigged
with two tonnes of explosives and 19,000 litres (5,000 gallons)
of chlorine disabled outside a police station in the western town
of Ramadi, it said.


Ramadi is the capital of Iraq's Al-Anbar province where three
suicide bombers blew up trucks filled with toxic chlorine gas
earlier this month, killing at least two Iraqi policemen and
putting 350 civilians in hospital.


The white cargo truck pulled up outside the Jezeera police
station, about 150 metres (yards) from a water treatment plant on
Friday, the military said.


Officers detained the driver when they realised the vehicle was
rigged with explosives which the driver was trying to detonate,
the Americans said.


"The truck contained an unknown number of 55 gallon drums, which
were used to camouflage five 1,000 gallon barrels filled with
chlorine and more than two tons of explosives," said the US
statement.


A spate of seven gas attacks against civilians or security forces
in Iraq this year has raised fears that Sunni insurgents loyal to
Al-Qaeda have found a new tactic in their campaign of violence
against the Shiite-led government and its Western backers.
