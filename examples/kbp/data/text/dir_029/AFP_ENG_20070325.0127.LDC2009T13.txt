Chinese-based Sino Hua-An International Bhd will list on
Malaysia's stock exchange Monday in what will be the bourse's
first "red chip" stock, state Bernama news agency said in a
weekend report.


Sino Hua-An International will be listed on the main board of
Bursa Malaysia in place of Antah Holdings Bhd, after the
restructuring scheme of Antah.


"As part of the restructuring scheme, Sino Hua-An International
Berhad ... will be listed on the Main Board under the Industrial
Products sector," the stock exchange said in a statement.


Sino Hua-An's revenues and profits are derived almost entirely
from its business as a metallurgical coke producer in China, a
key ingredient in steel manufacturing.


Sino Hua-An's managing director Liu Guodong said the company
would be the first true "red chip", or China-based company, to be
listed on the Malaysian exchange, Bernama reported.


Bernama said the stock had been oversubscribed by 21 times,
indicating positive interest from investors.


Sino Hua-An's plant is in Shandong, where half of China's coal
reserves are located. The company has an annual capacity of more
than 1.2 million tonnes of metallurgical coke, its main source of
income.


Its annual production of metallurgical coke in 2005 totalled
1.324 million tonnes, Bernama reported.


The company's executive chairman Tunku Naquiyuddin Tuanku Ja'afar
said the production was currently only for the Chinese market.


Tunku Naquiddin, who is also the chairman of Antah Holdings, is
the single largest shareholder with a 27 percent stake in Sino
Hua-An.
