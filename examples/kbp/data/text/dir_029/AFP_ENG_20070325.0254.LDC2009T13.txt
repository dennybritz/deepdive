Kuwaiti petrochemicals firm Equate reported a 3.7 percent drop in
2006 net profits Sunday blaming a 30-day  maintenance shutdown.


The profits of 566 million dollars posted by the US-Kuwaiti joint
venture compared with 588 million dollars in 2005 and 620.5
million dollars in 2004.


Equate chairman and chief executive officer Hamad al-Terkait said
that, despite the shutdown, the company's sales last year still
exceeded projections by six percent, topping one million tonnes.


Equate is a two-billion-dollar joint venture between the US Dow
Chemical Company and state-owned Petrochemical Industries Company
(PIC) with 42.5 percent each, and the private Bubiyan
Petrochemical Company, with nine percent.


Al-Qurain Petrochemicals, another private firm, owns the
remaining six percent.


Equate, which began operations in 1997, has a production capacity
of 800,000 tonnes of ethylene, 600,000 tonnes of polyethylene and
400,000 tonnes of ethylene glycol.


The company is undertaking a major expansion to more than double
its production capacity by early 2008.
