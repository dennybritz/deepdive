Libya's foreign minister met with Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika on Sunday ahead of an upcoming Arab summit that Libya
has pledged to boycott.


Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham announced this month that
his country would not attend the summit, set to begin Wednesday
in Saudi Arabia, because Arab countries were "not serious."


At the time, he said, "Arabs now consider Iran to be the main
enemy and have forgotten Israel."


An Arab delegate in the Saudi capital told AFP Sunday that Libya
intends to stick to its boycott.


Shalgham said he and Bouteflika also discussed the war in Iraq,
the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, regional security and efforts
to combat terrorism.


He said they engaged in long discussions on bilateral relations,
and that an Algerian-Libyan mixed commission is due to meet next
month.
