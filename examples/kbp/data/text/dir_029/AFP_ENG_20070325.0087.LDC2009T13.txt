One woman was killed and 162 people were injured, 12 of them
seriously, in a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that rocked Japan's main
island of Honshu on Sunday, the disaster management agency said.


The agency said that the number of casualties might rise after
the powerful quake which struck off the western coast of Japan at
about 9:42 am (0042 GMT), triggering a brief tsunami alert.


Dozens of buildings collapsed and residents took cover in
emergency shelters as aftershocks rattled Japan's main island of
Honshu.


The epicentre of the quake was located under the sea bed about
300 kilometres (200 miles) northwest of the capital Tokyo.
