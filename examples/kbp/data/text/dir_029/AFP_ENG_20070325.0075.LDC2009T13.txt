Former Red Army faction militant Brigitte Mohnhaupt, who was
deemed Germany's most dangerous woman in the 1970s, has been
freed after 24 years in jail, a justice official said on Sunday.


Mohnhaupt, who was convicted for her role in nine murders in the
group's violent campaign against the West German state, was
released on parole from a prison in southern Germany in the early
hours of the morning, Wolfgang Deuschl said.


Mohnhaupt, 57, was collected at the prison by friends, he added.


A German court last month granted her parole because she has
served her minimum sentence and is no longer believed to pose a
threat to society.


But the families of the victims of the RAF, also known as the
Baader-Meinhof Gang, have bitterly opposed the release, partly
because she has never expressed remorse over the murders.


Mohnhaupt was part of the second generation of RAF leaders who
took over after Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ennslin
were caught and eventually committed suicide in jail.


The RAF's campaign reached a violent crescendo in the so-called
German Autumn in 1977 when they kidnapped and killed leading
industrialist and former Nazi Hanns- Martin Schleyer and hijacked
a plane with the help of Palestinian militants.


Schleyer's widow was among those who opposed Mohnhaupt's release,
saying she was "appalled" at the prospect.


Mohnhaupt was arrested near Frankfurt in 1982.


Her release had initially been scheduled for Tuesday.
