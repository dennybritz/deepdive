A "fire show" in a Moscow night club went wrong and the ensuing
inferno killed 10 people, officials and witnesses said Sunday.


A Bulgarian was among the dead, who were all apparently killed by
the smoke. Four people were also injured, officials said.


A nightly "fire show" being performed by a waiter at the club
using spirits went badly wrong, a 20-year-old barman at the club
told rescue workers, according to a spokesman for the emergency
situations ministry.


"The waiter's clothing caught fire, after which the flame spread
to a five-litre container with spirits and then the stage caught
fire," the spokesman, Yevgeny Bobylev, was quoted by the Interfax
news agency as saying.


"The barman's hair caught fire," said one young woman witness,
quoted by NTV television. "We tried to put it out but we couldn't
do anything," said another.


"As a result of the fire, 10 people, including a Bulgarian
national, died and we are working on their identification,"
Moscow's deputy prosecutor Vladimir Poneversky was quoted as
saying by the RIA Novosti news agency.


The club is located in the historic Lenkom theatre building in
central Moscow and the blaze covered 100 square metres (1,075
square feet), NTV television reported.


Poneversky said the fire had started near the bar and quickly
engulfed the club with carbon monoxide, killing people on the
spot. Moscow prosecutors have launched an investigation into
safety at the club.
