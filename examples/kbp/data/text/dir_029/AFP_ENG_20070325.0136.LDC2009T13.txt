China has named new Communist Party bosses for two major cities
and one vital province, state media said Sunday, in what could
herald key personnel changes ahead of a party congress this fall.


In the appointment attracting most attention, 53-year-old Xi
Jinping, a widely recognised rising star, was named Shanghai's
new Communist Party chief, the Xinhua news agency reported.


Xi will vacate the job as party boss in east China's Zhejiang
province, and that position will now go to Zhao Hongzhu, born in
1947, according to Xinhua.


Meanwhile, 61-year-old Zhao Gaoli has been given the job as party
leader in the port city of Tianjin, close to Beijing.


The 68-million-member Communist Party is scheduled this fall to
hold its 17th Congress, the most important gathering of its kind
in five years.


In the run-up to the party congresses, there are often sweeping
second-tier personnel changes as part of complex maneuvers to
move proteges and supporters into positions of influence for the
coming five-year period.
