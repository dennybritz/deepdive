Malaysia's health ministry may impose retail floor prices for
cigarettes to discourage smoking and stop tobacco companies from
luring buyers with cheaper products, weekend reports said.


Health Minister Chua Soi Lek said a price war had made cigarettes
cheaper despite the annual increase of levies for tobacco and
liquor, as manufacturers cut prices to boost sales, state Bernama
news agency reported.


"The ministry is disappointed by the actions of multinational
tobacco companies, which of late have launched a price war to
increase their sales. This goes against the government's wish to
see a reduction in smoking among Malaysians," Chua said,
according to Bernama.


Chua said the the government would also continue to review taxes
on tobacco products to ensure their prices remained high to
reduce demand, Bernama reported.


"Studies have shown prices and demand for tobacco products are
closely tied. When prices go up, demand goes down," he said.


Chua said the ministry was also pushing for graphic pictures on
cigarette packaging to warn of the hazards of smoking.


"These graphic warnings will need to be changed from time to time
so that smokers know clearly what they are exposing themselves to
by smoking," Chua said.


According to the health ministry's data, 48 percent of males and
just over 21 percent of females in Malaysia are smokers, in a
population of almost 27 million.


The number of Malaysians taking up cigarette smoking is
reportedly on the rise despite high-profile government campaigns
to curb the habit.
