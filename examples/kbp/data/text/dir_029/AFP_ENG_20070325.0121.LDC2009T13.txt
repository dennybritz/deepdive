A senior Saudi police officer was executed Sunday after being
convicted of sexually assaulting two men and making video
recordings of his crimes, the official SPA news agency said.


The court had found Turki al-Tuwairaki guilty of kidnapping two
men -- one of them a Saudi national -- and then forcing them to
commit "obscene" acts, the news agency said.


The court imposed the death penalty because of the accused's
gross abuse of his powers as a police officer, it added.


His execution brings to 22 the number announced by the Saudi
authorities so far this year.


Last year at least 37 people were executed, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia
or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
