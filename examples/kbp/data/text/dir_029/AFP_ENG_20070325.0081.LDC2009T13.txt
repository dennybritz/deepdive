Voting started Sunday in the second round of Mauritania's first
democratic presidential election since its independence in 1960.


The runoff election pits former cabinet minister Sidi Ould Cheikh
Abdallahi against longtime opposition politician Ahmed Ould
Daddah, both of whom spent time in prison during the country's
military dictatorship.


Polling stations opened at 0700 GMT. and are set to close at 1900
GMT.


Some 1.1 million people are eligible to vote in the election
which is the final stage in Mauritania's gradual return to
civilian rule after a military coup in August 2005 which ended
more than two decades of dictatorship under Maaouiya Ould Taya.
