Wait for them to cross and do not honk at them or they could come
after you, warns a government official to highway users about
elephants reportedly straying onto a main Malaysian highway.


Natural Resources and Environment Ministry Parliamentary
Secretary Sazmi Miah said motorists honking at elephants could
trigger a rampage, state Bernama news agency reported Sunday.


"It is safer for motorists to stop their vehicles and wait for
the elephants to go into the jungle before continuing their
journey," Sazmi said, according to Bernama.


Sazmi's warning comes after a motorist along the East-West
highway was chased by a herd of elephants last week, forcing him
to turn west towards Penang island instead of towards eastern
Kelantan state where he was headed.


No injuries were reported after the 50-metre chase, Bernama
reported. Sazmi said the elephants could have been agitated by
the sound of the honk.


He said there have been many reports of elephants straying onto
the highway, especially further north where the roads are flanked
by large tracts of jungle.


As a precautionary measure, to warn motorists of elephants
crossing, the Wildlife and National Parks Department would erect
signs along the highway, Sazmi said.


The signs would include tips on how to ward off wandering jumbos,
especially at night.
