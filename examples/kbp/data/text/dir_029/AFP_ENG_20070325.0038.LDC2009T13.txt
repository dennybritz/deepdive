Three workers at a Japanese thermal power plant were exposed to
radiation Sunday but were unharmed, an official said.


"They were conducting an X-ray inspection of the plant and were
exposed to radiation, but there are no worries about their
health," said a spokesman for the Hekinan heat power plant in
Aichi prefecture in central Japan.


The accident was unrelated to a powerful earthquake which hit the
western coast of Japan's main island of Honshu on Sunday, he
said.
