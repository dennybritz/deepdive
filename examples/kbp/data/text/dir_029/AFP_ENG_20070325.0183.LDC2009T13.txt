Spain's reigning champion Jorge Lorenzo won his second successive
250cc race this season here on Sunday.


The 19-year-old - who started from pole position on his Aprilia -
beat home his compatriot Alvaro Bautista, also on an Aprilia,
while Italian Andrea Dovizioso, riding a Honda, was third.


Lorenzo - who was winning the 14th race of his career - won the
opening race of the season in Qatar.
