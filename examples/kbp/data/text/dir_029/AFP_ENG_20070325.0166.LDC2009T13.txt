Michael Phelps banked the first of his anticipated eight gold
medals as he led the Americans to a dominant 4x100m relay victory
at the world championships Sunday.


The multi-talented superstar kicked it off with a 48.42sec
opening leg and the Americans brought it home to win in a new
championship record of three minutes 12.72 seconds to beat Italy
(3:14.04) and France (3:14.68).


Phelps is attempting an ambitious sweep of eight gold medals here
in preparation for an assault on compatriot Mark Spitz's 1972
Olympic record of seven gold at next year's Beijing Olympics.


Phelps' advantage was built on by Neil Walker (48.31), Cullen
Jones (48.67) and Jason Lezak (47.32) to win the gold by a
comfortable 1.32 seconds.


"In the past we have started out a meet strongly and I'm glad we
have been able to do that again here," Phelps said.


The Americans have only been beaten twice in the men's 4x100m
relay in 12 world championships, losing to Australia in Fukuoka
in 2001 and Russia in Barcelona two years later.


Olympic champions South Africa, who stunned the Americans with a
world record win at the Athens Olympics three years ago, were
fourth in 3:14.77, over two seconds behind the United States.
