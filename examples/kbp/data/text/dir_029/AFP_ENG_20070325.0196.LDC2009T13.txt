Poland's Adam Malysz jumped to his fourth World Cup ski jumping
crown here on Sunday after winning the last event of the season.


Malysz, who won all three events contested from Friday to Sunday,
claimed victory on the last day after the normal two jumps were
reduced to one due to adverse weather conditions.


The Pole, who scorched to the World Championship title last month
in Sapporo, beat off the efforts of Swiss jumper Simon Ammann and
Martin Koch of Austria who rounded off the podium.


"I am very happy, very proud to have won the crown here in
Planica on the large hill when everyone said that I was a small
hill specialist," said the four-time world champion.


Norway's 22-year-old Anders Jacobsen, the only competitor with a
chance to pip Malysz to the crystal globe going into the last
event, finished down the order in eighth place, ending the season
second in the overall standings 134 points off the leader.
