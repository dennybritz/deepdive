The trial of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor,
already on Libya's death row but prosecuted for slander after
accusing the police of torture, was adjourned on Sunday until
April 22.


After a brief court hearing, judge Salem al-Hamri acceded to a
request by defence counsel Othman al-Bizanti for a delay to
enable a Bulgarian lawyer, who had just joined the defence team,
to study the files.


The six medics have been in prison for eight years and were
condemned to death in 2004 after being convicted of injecting
more than 400 Libyan children with HIV-tainted blood. More than
50 subsequently died of AIDS.


The accused said their "confessions" in the HIV trial were forced
from them under torture, including beatings, electric shocks and
being threatened by dogs.


The slander charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in
prison. The nurses are Kristiana Valcheva, Nassia Nenova, Valia
Cherveniachka, Valentina Siropoulo and Snejana Dimitrova, and the
doctor Ashraf Ahmad Juma.


The medics, largely viewed as scapegoats by the international
community, maintain their innocence based on testimony by foreign
health experts who said the Benghazi AIDS epidemic was sparked by
poor hygiene.


The six launched a last appeal against their death sentences on
February 17.
