Mongolian rising sumo star Hakuho picked up his second career
title on Sunday with an impressive win over compatriot Asashoryu,
the grand champion who is plagued by match-fixing allegations.


Hakuho, a 22-year-old whose real name is Munkhbat Davaajargal, is
one of the second-highest ranked ozeki wrestlers who were under
pressure to stop the rarely beaten Asashoryu, currently the only
yokozuna grand champion.


In the 15-day Spring Grand Sumo Tournament, Hakuho lost just
twice while Asashoryu ended with three losses.


In the playoff bout, Hakuho quickly stepped away before slaming
into Asashoryu and pushing him down on the ring, a technique that
often catches wrestlers by surprise as they prepare mistakenly
for a full tackle.


"I was determined to fight with my full strength," Hakuho said.
"I'm very happy."


The grand champion seemed amazed after he touched the ground,
sealing his defeat, but he smiled bitterly afterward.


The yokozuna had himself applied a similar tactic to beat
Japanese wrestler Chiyotaikai before the playoff bout.


Asashoryu, a 26-year-old Mongolian whose real name is Dolgorsuren
Dagvadorj, lost the first two bouts in a row at the start of the
spring tournament.


He has been the focus of a series of magazine reports that
accused him of fixing matches during a tournament in November
when he won all 15 bouts to collect his 19th trophy.


Japan's angry sumo community filed a defamation case with a Tokyo
court against the magazine publisher and a writer.


Asashoryu is currently the only grand champion and the fifth
strongest in the history of the Japanese national sport.
