French President Jacques Chirac said Sunday that Britain had the
"complete solidarity" of the leaders of the European Union in the
case of 15 British naval personnel seized by Iranian forces.


"We all expressed our complete solidarity with Britain. It seems
clear that the soldiers were not in the Iranian zone at the time
(of their capture)," Chirac told reporters in Berlin at EU 50th
anniverary celebrations.
