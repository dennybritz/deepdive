Afghan security forces killed 18 Taliban militants in two
separate clashes in south and southeastern Afghanistan, the
military said Sunday.


A group of armed Taliban attacked an Afghan army post in the
Lawara area of Gian district in southeastern Paktika province
early Sunday, sparking a three-hour gunbattle, regional army
commander Mohammad Akram Sami told AFP.


"In the three-hour fighting seven enemy elements were killed. We
have the seven bodies," he said.


The commander said two wounded insurgents were arrested, one of
them was identified as a Pakistani national.


In a separate incident on Saturday a joint force of Afghan army,
police and intelligence killed 11 Taliban militants in Lashkar
Gah, the capital of Helmand province, the defence ministry said.


"Eleven enemies of peace were killed in the sweep-up operation,"
it said in a statement.


The operation in Helmand was launched following a major battle
with Taliban militants on Thursday in which 69 insurgents and
seven police were killed.


South and southeastern Afghanistan have been the regions most
affected by the Taliban-led insurgency, which claimed more than
4,000 lives in 2006.


The hardline Taliban regime was ousted in US-led offensive in
late 2001.


Taliban loyalists have stepped up their attacks in the past weeks
although military officials reject the rebels' talk of a "spring
offensive" as propaganda.
