Britain's ambassador to Tehran on Sunday asked to see 15 British
sailors being held by Tehran for alleged straying into Iranian
waters, and demanded they be released immediately.


International pressure is mounting on Tehran to free the 15, who
were seized in the Shatt al-Arab waterway between Iran and Iraq
on Friday as they conducted "routine" anti-smuggling operations.


British ambassador Geoffrey Adams met foreign ministry officials
on Sunday after his return to Iran, a British diplomat told AFP.


"He asked them for information about where the 15 British sailors
are being detained and the possibility of meeting them," a
British diplomat said. "He also demanded their immediate
release."


However, the Iranian officials did not say where the Britons were
being held, the diplomat said.


Iran said on Saturday that the 15 had admitted to violating its
territorial waters.
