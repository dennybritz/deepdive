Italy's seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi celebrated his
85th career win but first for six races here on Sunday as he won
the Spanish MotoGP.


The flamboyant 28-year-old Yamaha rider spoilt the hopes of the
138,000 home fans as he beat home Spaniard Dani Pedrosa, riding a
Honda, while American Colin Edwards was third, also on a Yamaha.


Rossi, who last won in Malaysia in September 2006, dominated the
race leading from start to finish as Pedrosa failed to take
advantage of his pole position.


Rossi was almost overcome with joy at breaking his drought.


"This victory is very moving because the last time I won was in
September and the taste of victory is unforgettable," he said.


"This is an important win because the next two races aren't great
for our team."


Pedrosa for his part was not too disappointed.


"Yes of course there is a slight sense of disappointment for the
fans," said Pedrosa.


"However to be on the podium for the second time this season is
great and wonderful for the team.


"It wasn't an easy race, it will be a difficult championship and
there is a lot of hard work ahead of us."


Australia's Casey Stoner, who won the opener in Qatar, never got
into the mix and finished fifth.


Earlier the home fans did have something to celebrate as Spain's
reigning champion Jorge Lorenzo won his second successive 250cc
race this season.


The 19-year-old - who started from pole position on his Aprilia -
beat home his compatriot Alvaro Bautista, also on an Aprilia,
while Italian Andrea Dovizioso, riding a Honda, was third.


Lorenzo - who was winning the 14th race of his career - won the
opening race of the season in Qatar.


Gabor Talmacsi of Hungary (Aprilia) won the 125cc race.
