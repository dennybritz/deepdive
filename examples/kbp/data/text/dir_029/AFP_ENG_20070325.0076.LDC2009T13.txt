The South Sydney Rabbitohs continued their unbeaten start to the
new Australian National Rugby League season with a comprehensive
31-6 win over Parramatta on Sunday.


Souths, who recruited heavily in the off-season under part-owner
and Hollywood actor Russell Crowe, scored five tries to one to
consign the Eels to their second straight loss.


The win was again built on a solid defence which allowed just one
try for the second straight week.


The home side only led 12-6 at the break but ran away with the
match in the second half.


New Zealand Warriors meanwhile downed defending champions
Brisbane Broncos 24-14 in Auckland.


The Warriors scored four tries to three to keep the champions
winless this season.


After a slow start, in which Brisbane led 10-2, the Warriors put
on a stunning display to score four tries in 11 minutes and led
24-10 at halftime.


Although the Warriors were scoreless in the second half, the home
side monopolised much of the play.
