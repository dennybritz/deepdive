US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in Israel on
Sunday on the second leg of a regional tour aimed at reviving
Middle East peace talks.


Rice was due to travel to the West Bank city of Ramallah for
talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas immediately
following her arrival in Tel Aviv from Egypt.


She was then due to return to Jerusalem for talks with UN chief
Ban Ki-moon, making his first official visit to the Middle East
since assuming office in January, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert.


Washington has been trying to enlist the help of its Arab allies
to breathe new life into a five-year-old Saudi peace initiative
ahead of an Arab League summit in Riyadh on Wednesday.


On Monday Rice is to travel to Jordan for talks with King
Abdullah II and Abbas before returning to Israel for another
meeting with Olmert.


Her visit comes less than two weeks after the Palestinians
unveiled a unity government including members of both prime
minister Ismail Haniya's Islamist Hamas movement and president
Mahmud Abbas's secular Fatah party.
