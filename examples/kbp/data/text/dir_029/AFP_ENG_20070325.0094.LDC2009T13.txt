Prime Minister Ehud Olmert accused Palestinian president Mahmud
Abbas on Sunday of violating various commitments to Israel, ahead
of separate talks between both leaders and visiting US Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice.


"The Palestinian Authority chairman blatantly violated a series
of commitments given to Israel, especially a commitment not to
form a national unity government before the release of Gilad
Shalit," Olmert told the weekly cabinet meeting.


He was referring to an Israeli soldier seized by Gaza-based
militants nine months ago, whose fate has been one of the main
sticking points in Israeli- Palestinian relations.


"This commitment was given time and again to myself and to world
leaders," Olmert said.


"There is no doubt that a completely different conduct by the PA
is needed in order to create the right atmosphere that would lead
to fruitful negotiations."
