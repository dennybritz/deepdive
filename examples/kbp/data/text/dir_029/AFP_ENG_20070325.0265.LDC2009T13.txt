An unfinished book by "Lord of the Rings" author J.R.R. Tolkien,
which was completed by his son, will go on sale on next month,
the Independent on Sunday said.


"The Children of Hurin", which Tolkien began in 1918, will be in
bookshops on April 17, the newspaper added. The author's son,
Christopher, spent 30 years completing the story from the many
drafts produced by his father.


Publisher HarperCollins is keeping exact details of the story
under close wraps but its description as "an epic story of
adventure, tragedy, fellowship and heroism" will be familiar to
the legions of Tolkien fans.


Artist Alan Lee has provided 25 pencil sketches and eight
paintings for the book.


Lee won an Oscar for art direction on Peter Jackson's "The Return
of the King", the third blockbuster film based on the "Lord of
Rings" trilogy that brought the stories to a worldwide audience.


"The Children of Hurin" is the first "new" Tolkien book since a
collection of his works -- "The Silmarillion" -- was published
posthumously in 1977, four years after the writer's death. It was
also edited by Christopher Tolkien.


The chairman of the Tolkien Society, Chris Crawshaw, was quoted
by the Independent on Sunday as saying: "It ('The Children of
Hurin') would probably make a very good movie, if anyone can
secure the film rights."
