Armenian Prime Minister Andranik Margarian, leader of the ruling
Republican party, died of a heart attack on Sunday, the
president's office said in a statement.


"Margarian died suddenly at his home today in the 56th year of
his life as a result of a heart attack... President Robert
Kocharian has called an emergency government meeting," the
statement said.


Margarian had been in office in this former Soviet republic since
2000. Previously he was a parliamentary deputy in the 1990s and
served in different government departments in Soviet times.


A trained engineer, Margarian was arrested for anti-Soviet
dissident activity in 1974 and sentenced to two years in prison,
according to his official biography.
