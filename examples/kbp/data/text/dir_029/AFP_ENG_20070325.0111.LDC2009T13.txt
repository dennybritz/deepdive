South Korean farmers and anti-globalisation activists held a
boisterous rally Sunday outside the US embassy here against free
trade talks with the United States.


Thousands of riot police armed with batons and water cannon
erected barricades with more than 100 buses around an
intersection leading to the embassy.


But about 2,000 activists chanting "We oppose US!" ran through
alleys after a rally near the Seoul city hall to bypass the
police cordon and gathered outside the tightly-guarded embassy.


Wearing red headbands and waving flags, they demanded the United
States and South Korea scrap negotiations on a free trade
agreement (FTA).


Scuffles erupted when activists kicked and punched police outside
the embassy, but there were no injuries or arrests.


At an earlier rally, more than 7,000 protesters demanded the
government put the issue to a national referendum.


"Stop the South Korea-US FTA, which threatens the livelihood of
our people," they said in a statement.


Organisers said about 10,000 people participated in the rally on
a park outside the Seoul city hall. Police put the number at
7,500.


South Korea and the United States will meet in Seoul Monday to
seek a final deal after 10 months of tough negotiations.


The deal, if agreed, would be the biggest since the 1993 North
American Free Trade Agreement. US-South Korean bilateral trade
reached 74 billion dollars in 2006.
