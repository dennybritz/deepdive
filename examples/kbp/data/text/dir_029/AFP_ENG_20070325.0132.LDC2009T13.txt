A group of Shiite mourners who were shot at while on their way to
bury victims of a bomb attack retaliated by throwing a bomb
inside a Sunni mosque which wounded two people Sunday, police
said.


The incident happened in the town of Iskandiriyah, 50 kilometres
(31 miles), south of Baghdad, when unknown gunmen opened fire on
the Shiites as they were heading to the holy city of Najaf to
bury victims of a bomb attack on Friday.


"After these mourners were attacked, they retaliated by throwing
a bomb in the Sunni Abdallah al-Juburi mosque wounding two
people," police officer Salim al- Mamuri from Iskandiriyah told
AFP.


The Shiites were carrying bodies of victims who died in
Saturday's truck bombing in the town of Haswa, near Hilla that
killed 10 people. None of the Shiite mourners were wounded in
Sunday's shooting incident.


Iraq is battling a raging Sunni-Shiite conflict that has killed
tens of thousands across the country, mostly in Baghdad.
