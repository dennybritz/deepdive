Ethiopian athletics great Kenenisa Bekele admitted on Sunday that
his stunning retirement from the world cross country race had
been because he lost control both of his body and his head.


The 23-year-old Olympic and world 10,000m champion saw his hopes
of an unprecedented sixth successive 12km crown disappear when he
was dropped by Eritrean Zersenay Tadesse on the sixth and final
lap.


However it got worse for him as he pulled up shortly afterwards
and complained of severe stomach pain as a result of the extreme
heat and humidity.


In a statement released by his Dutch manager Jos Hermens, Bekele
speaks of his enormous disappointment but insisted that he had
done all he could possibly do to finish the race - some observers
believed that the fact he and four of his team-mates hadn't
finished was because they miscounted the amount of laps.


"During the race, I started to have some stomach problems, but I
was not too worried," said Bekele.


"Then, suddenly, I felt that my coordination was not good and
that my mind was dizzy. I even started to doubt about how many
laps I still had to run. I was confused and felt that I lost all
my energy.


"I was slowing down and felt that I was losing control over my
body as well as my mind. This is why I decided to stop the race.
I lost control of first my body and then my head," added Bekele,
who is also world record holder in the 5000m and 10000m.
