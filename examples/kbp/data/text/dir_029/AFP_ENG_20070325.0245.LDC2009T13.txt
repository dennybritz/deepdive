The Norwegian men's nordic skiing relay team claimed victory in
the World Cup 4x10km event here on Sunday, the last race of the
season.


The Norwegian team crossed the line in a time of 1 hour 49 min
10.7sec with Russia and France grabbing second and third
respectively after a photo-finish.


Germany pulled out prior to the race due to the absence of World
Cup champion and team leader Tobias Angerer.
