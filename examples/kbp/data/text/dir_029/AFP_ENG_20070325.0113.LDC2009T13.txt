China CITIC Bank, the nation's seventh-largest commercial bank,
plans to go public at home and in Hong Kong at the end of April,
raising up to three billion dollars, state media said Sunday.


The bank won approval to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange
last week and is now awaiting approval from the China Securities
Regulatory Commission to go public in mainland China as well, the
Xinhua news agency reported.


By listing on the mainland and on the Hong Kong stock markets,
the bank aims to strengthen corporate governance in line with
international practices, according to the agency.


Last year the Beijing-based bank issued six billion yuan (775
million dollars) in bonds and received a five-billion-yuan cash
injection from its parent to improve its capital adequacy levels.


It has also courted strategic investors, selling a 16.4 percent
stake to CITIC International Financial Holdings, CITIC Group's
Hong Kong-based flagship company, and a 4.83 percent share to
BBVA, Spain's second-largest bank.
