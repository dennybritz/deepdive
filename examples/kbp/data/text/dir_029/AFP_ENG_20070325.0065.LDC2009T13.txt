A court in the United Arab Emirates has sentenced an Iranian to
death for drug smuggling, a report said Sunday.


The Islamic tribunal in the conservative UAE emirate of Sharjah
convicted Jamshed Taher of smuggling 267 kilogrammes (589 pounds)
of hashish, the Gulf News daily said.


It also found him guilty of travelling with a forged passport.


Emirati law provides for capital punishment for drug traffickers
and several foreigners were sentenced to death for the crime in
2005 and 2006, although no executions were announced.


Death sentences in the UAE are often commuted to life
imprisonment by higher courts of the seven-emirate federation.
