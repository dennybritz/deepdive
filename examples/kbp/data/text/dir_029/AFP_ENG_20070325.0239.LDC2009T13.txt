German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday the European Union
could hold an inter-governmental conference later this year to
define a new treaty that would replace the moribund constitution.


"We (Germany) are going to do everything that we can to prepare a
road map," charting the way out of the political impasse over the
constitution, she said during 50th anniversary celebrations of
the EU's founding treaty.


"If it meets the criteria, it could be the basis for an inter-
governmental conference (ICG)," she said, adding that Portugal
"could organise an ICG" when it takes over the EU's six-month
rotating presidency from Germany in July.


EU leaders on Sunday endorsed a "Berlin Declaration" in which
they committed to resolve the bloc's institutional woes by the
next European Parliament elections in 2009.


The constitution, meant to simplify the way the EU operates as it
expands,  has been in political limbo since it was rejected by
French and Dutch voters in referendums in mid-2005.
