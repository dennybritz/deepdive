Malaysia will recruit 37,000 more police officers, expanding the
force by more than a third as it tries to improve its public
image amid allegations of corruption.


Police Inspector General Musa Hassan said bolstering the numbers
would improve the efficiency of the force, state Bernama news
agency said over the weekend.


"Strengthening the force with more manpower will enable us to
tackle internal and external threats effectively," it quoted Musa
as saying in conjuction with the 200th anniversary of the force.


Official statistics have shown that criminal incidents jumped
45.1 percent in three years since 2003, with 232,620 criminal
cases recorded last year.


A survey by watchdog group Transparency International showed that
56 percent of the public see the police as the public
organisation with the lowest integrity and transparency.


Musa said a pay hike would help curb bribery.


"Our men will be more aware that they have been given a decent
salary ... they will think twice about accepting bribes," he told
the Star newspaper.


A general duty officer receives 2,122 ringgit (611.5 dollars) in
salary and allowances while constables earn less than half that,
the paper said.
