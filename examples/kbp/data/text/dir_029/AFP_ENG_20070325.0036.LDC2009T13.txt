Australian Prime Minister John Howard Sunday denied his party's
loss in a weekend state election represented a protest vote
against his policies ahead of this year's national poll.


Voters in New South Wales on Saturday comfortably returned the
incumbent centre- left Labor government, a vote carefully watched
ahead of the conservative Howard's fifth tilt at winning the top
job later this year.


NSW Premier Morris Iemma said the result, which leaves all states
in Labor control, sent a strong message to Howard's
Liberal/National coalition that its workplace relations laws were
deeply unpopular.


The laws encourage workers to negotiate salary conditions
directly with their employers, a practice union leaders say will
lead to the erosion of benefits such as holiday pay, overtime and
working conditions.


"There is a clear message to Canberra and they will ignore it at
their peril," Iemma said.


But asked whether he thought NSW voters had lodged a protest vote
against the federal government's labour policies, Howard said:
"No I don't."


"As I go around the community, I keep hearing these criticisms,
but I'm not coming across people who are affected," he told
reporters.


"I think the result was driven overwhelmingly by state issues."


"The bottom line is that we didn't win and that is
disappointing."
