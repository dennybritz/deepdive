British Attorney General Lord Goldsmith announced Sunday Britain
would give nine million pounds (18 million dollars) towards
Afghanistan's efforts to put drugs traffickers behind bars.


Goldsmith toured a compound of Afghanistan's criminal justice
task force where he met officials involved in prosecuting drugs
traffickers and saw some of several hundred kilogrammes of heroin
and opium seized by authorities.


"Drugs are one of the gravest threats to the long-term security,
development and government of Afghanistan," the attorney general
told reporters.


"Ninety percent of the heroin on the streets of my country comes
from this country. We are committed to helping the government of
Afghanistan deal with this evil trade."


Afghanistan is the world's top producer of opium, the raw
ingredient of heroin.


The government, which says drugs are funding the Taliban-led
insurgency, is working with several countries to try to end the
trade by rounding up those involved and persuading farmers to
grow other crops.
