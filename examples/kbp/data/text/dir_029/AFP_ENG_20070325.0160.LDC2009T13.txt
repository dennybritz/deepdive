Islamic banking group Kuwait Finance House, through its Malaysian
subsidiary Kuwait Finance House Malaysia Bhd (KFHMB), has set up
a property venture in China.


KFHMB, with its partners, Belanie Management Ltd and Risun Group,
will establish the venture in densely-populated Chongqing, KFHMB
said in a statement Sunday.


"Through this partnership, KFHMB will be the first Islamic bank
to be involved in a corporate real estate transaction in Western
China," K. Salman Younis, KFHMB's managing director, said in the
statement.


"This is part of KFHMB's plan to increase its investment
opportunities in the region," Younis said.


He also said that the plan could play an important role in
developing Islamic finance in the region.


The deal was inked last Tuesday in Chongqing.


KFHMB and Belanie will invest in Risun Group's development of a
real estate project in Chongqing called Jahoo HongKong city, a
retail and residential site.


No details were given on the sum of the investment.
