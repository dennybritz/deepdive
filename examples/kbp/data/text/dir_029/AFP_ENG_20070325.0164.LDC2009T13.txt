Olympic champion Jodie Henry produced a withering finish to give
Australia victory over the United States in the women's 4x100m
freestyle relay in a new world championship time here Sunday.


Henry powered home, urged on by her roaring home crowd, to
overhaul Kara Lynn Joyce to win in a new championship record of
three minutes 35.48 seconds.


She anchored the Australians home with a flying last 100m swim of
53.21sec to out-touch Joyce (54.03) and defend the relay title
the Australian women won at the last world championships in
Montreal in 2005.


The Americans were second in 3:35.68 and the Dutch took bronze in
3:36.81.


Henry repeated her stirring last leg finish to get the
Australians up in the 4x100m relay over the Americans at the 2004
Athens Olympics.


She laughed when asked about her last lap swim: "Ah, it's old
news. The same thing happened at the Olympics (Athens 2004).


"I love coming from behind, I love chasing," she said.


"I always give up a bit on the start, so I'm pretty used to
having to chase people down."


American star Natalie Coughlin, who was hoping for relay gold to
boost her quest for seven titles at the meet, conceded the
Australians were too strong.


"We knew it would be a very tough race, and we were right. But we
did our best, and I am happy," she said.


World record holders Germany were the big disappointment,
finishing fourth in 3:36.94, some 1.7secs outside their world
mark.


Encouraging for the Germans later in the meet was that 100m
freestyle world record holder Britta Steffen clocked 52.65secs,
the fastest leg of the race.
