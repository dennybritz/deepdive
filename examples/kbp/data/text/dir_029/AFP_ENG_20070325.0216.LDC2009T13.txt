Protests were held in several Egyptian cities Sunday against a
set of constitutional amendments critics say will strip them of
civil liberties, security officials said.


About 300 hundred people demonstrated outside the lawyers'
syndicate in the north Sinai town of El-Arish, carrying banners
and shouting slogans against the proposed amendments which will
be put to a referendum on Monday.


Dozens also gathered outside the main courthouse in the Suez
Canal city of Ismailiya carrying banners branding the amendments
"a violation of personal rights."


The demonstrators were surrounded by large contingents of police
and both protests broke up without any incident being reported.


On Saturday, some 400 people gathered in the city of Suez for a
demonstration organised by the liberal opposition Wafd party.


The protest group Kefaya (Arabic for enough) was also planning
demonstrations in Cairo later Sunday and in the second city of
Alexandria on Monday.


Parliament, which is dominated by the ruling National Democratic
Party, overwhelmingly passed amendments to 34 articles of the
constitution that they say will strengthen democracy and fight
terrorism.


A united opposition front argues they will only strengthen the
regime's grip on power and has called on supporters to boycott
the referendum.
