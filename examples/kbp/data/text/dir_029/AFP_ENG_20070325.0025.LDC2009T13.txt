Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers on Sunday accused the army of planting a
roadside bomb that killed a local aid worker and wounded three
others when it exploded near their vehicle in the rebel-held
north.


"This is the work of the Sri Lankan army's deep penetrating
unit," a spokeswoman for the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE), Navaruban Selvy, said of Saturday's incident.


"The victims were trying to arrange relief for the civilians
recently displaced as a result of the latest fighting."


The worker was a volunteer with the Tamils' Rehabilitation
Organisation, a local charity that operates refugee centres and
distributes aid in rebel territory.


Sri Lanka's military denies carrying out bomb attacks inside
rebel-held territory, but military sources have acknowledged that
small groups of troops are operating behind rebel lines.


The report of the blast came as the defence ministry said it had
killed two suspected Tamil Tiger rebels in the north of the
island near a military bunker on Saturday.


Heavy fighting erupted along a de facto border between rebel-held
areas and the government-held Wanni region on Thursday and both
sides say they have inflicted heavy casualties on the other.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in a wave of fighting in
Sri Lanka since December 2005. The violence comes despite a truce
in place since February 2002.


The LTTE has been waging a 35-year campaign for an independent
homeland for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority in this majority
Sinhalese nation.
