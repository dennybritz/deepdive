A 5.3-magnitude aftershock hit the western coast of Japan's main
island Sunday, the meteorological agency said, hours after a
powerful earthquake killed one and injured over 160 in the same
region.


No tsunami alert was issued for the latest tremor, which hit the
Noto peninsula, about 300 kilometres (200 miles) northwest of the
capital, at 6:11 pm (0911 GMT), the agency said.


A 6.9-magnitude earthquake rocked the same region facing the Sea
of Japan (East Sea) earlier on the day.


The meteorological agency said as many as 108 tremors strong
enough to be felt by local residents were detected in the area
within a few hours of the strong quake.
