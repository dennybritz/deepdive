India on Sunday successfully tested a locally made air-to-air
missile in eastern Orissa state in the third such test since May
2003, defence officials said.


The missile was fired from the Integrated Test Range at
Chandipur, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Orissa's
capital Bhubaneswar.


It has a strike-range of 20 to 80 kilometres and can travel at
twice the speed of sound, defence sources said.


The single-stage solid-fuel missile can carry a 15 kilogram (33
pounds) conventional warhead, they said.


The test comes three days after neighbouring Pakistan test-fired
a nuclear- capable radar-dodging cruise missile with a range of
700 kilometres (435 miles).


The neighbours have routinely conducted missile tests since
carrying out tit- for-tat nuclear detonations in May 1998.


However in 2004 they launched a slow-moving peace process aimed
at ending six decades of hostility and resolving their dispute
over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, the cause of two of
their three wars.
