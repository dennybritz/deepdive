German champions Bayern Munich require a miracle if they are to
retain the title claimed their Dutch striker Roy Makaay on
Sunday.


The 32-year-old said that there was too much of a gap between
them and leaders Schalke 04 and that they would have to look to
next month's Champions League quarter-final with AC Milan to
achieve anything this season.


"With nine points difference between us and Schalke 04, we need a
miracle if we are to be crowned champions, especially with just
eight matches remaining," Makaay told the club website.


"We have three teams ahead of us and aside from that we also have
the Champions League quarter-final."


Makaay is not the first from Bayern to express his pessimism
about their title hopes, coach Ottmar Hitzfeld had already
dismissed winning the championship after they lost 1-0 to
Eintracht Frankfurt on March 17.


Makaay, who has scored 74 times including 12 this season for
Bayern in the Bundesliga since he signed for 20million euros in
2003, admitted that they needed to pull something out of what has
been a generally disappointing season by their high standards.


"We have to at least finish third in the championship: amd we
must do something special in the Champions Leagues," admitted the
Dutchman.
