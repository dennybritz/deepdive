French President Jacques Chirac said Sunday that Britain had the
"complete solidarity" of the leaders of the European Union in the
case of 15 British naval personnel seized by Iranian forces.


"We all expressed our complete solidarity with Britain. It seems
clear that the soldiers were not in the Iranian zone at the time
(of their capture)," he told reporters in Berlin at EU 50th
anniversary celebrations.


The German presidency of the European Union on Saturday called
for the "immediate release" of the British personnel seized in
the Gulf.


The 14 men and one woman were seized Friday on the Shatt al-Arab
waterway that divides Iraq and Iran.


Britain says they were conducting "routine" anti-smuggling
operations. Iran said Saturday that the group has admitted to
illegally entering Iranian waters.
