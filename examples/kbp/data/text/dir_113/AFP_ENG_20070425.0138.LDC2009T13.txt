Hong Kong, formerly the biggest customer for Japanese beef, on
Wednesday agreed to resume imports banned for more than five
years over fears of mad cow disease, Japanese officials said.


Hong Kong authorities notified Japan that they will lift the ban
on Friday, the farm ministry said.


The Chinese territory banned imports in September 2001 when Japan
became the first Asian nation to confirm a case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, the brain-wasting condition better
known as mad-cow disease, in its herd.


The resumption of trade is "a significant step to expand exports
of agricultural and stock-farm products," Japanese farm minister
Toshikatsu Matsuoka told reporters.


"It is of great significance for the vitalisation of the
agricultural industry," Matsuoka said.


Hong Kong was the biggest destination for Japan's beef exports in
2000, when the shipments came to 60 tons, or about 70 percent of
Japanese beef shipped overseas.


Japan promotes its "Kobe beef" as high-end. Ranchers sometimes
massage cows or feed them beer while they are being raised for
slaughter.


Hong Kong will be the third country to lift the ban on Japanese
beef, following Canada and the United States, both of which
lifted the ban in December 2005.


Mainland China still keeps ban on Japanese beef imports,
officials said.


Japan has had tortured negotiations with the United States, which
is pushing to ease restrictions on its own shipments of beef to
the Asian market.


Japan, formerly the top overseas market for US beef, has halted
imports twice since 2003 due to scares over mad cow disease.
