A Czech court ruled Wednesday that a Swedish man held here since
2005 on suspicion of abetting terrorists can be extradited to the
United States, legal officials said.


Oussama Kassir, 40, who is subject of an international arrest
warrant, was detained in December 2005 at Prague airport stepping
off an airplane from Stockholm for a connecting flight to Beirut.


He is wanted by the United States for allegedly plotting to
"provide material support for terrorist undertaking", according
to the New York prosecutor's office.


Washington has been pressing for his extradition for years but
Stockholm has never agreed. Kassir is a Swedish national of
Lebanese origin.


He is accused of having tried with others to set up in 1999 a
Jihad, or holy war, training camp in the northwestern US state of
Oregon to offer weapons training for Muslims wanting to fight in
Afghanistan.


Kassir, who denies the accusations, faces life imprisonment in
the US.
