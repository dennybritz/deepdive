Egypt plans to hike its oil output by 100,000 barrels per day to
800,000 bpd in 2008, the petroleum ministry said Wednesday.


"A programme was set up for developing some recent discoveries in
the Gulf of Suez and the western Sahara, with the aim of hiking
production by 100,000 bpd," a statement said.


"These new discoveries will be announced soon," ministry
spokesman Hamdi Abdel Aziz told AFP, adding that Egypt's current
output stood at about 700,000 bpd.


Production in the Gulf of Suez, which accounts for about 65
percent of Egypt's total, is expected to increase by 60,000 bpd,
the ministry said. Output from the western Sahara fields is due
to grow by 40,000 bpd.


Indian oil group ONGC Videsh announced earlier this month they
had struck an oil field in the Gulf of Suez believed to hold at
least 200 million barrels.


The petroleum ministry has recently offered a number of
incentives to boost the oil sector, which has remained in the
shadow of the lucrative gas sector in recent years.


Production has declined from its peak levels of close to one
million bpd in the mid-1990s, but Egypt has made just enough
discoveries to meet domestic consumption without having to import
crude.


Egypt is not a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries but has observer status at the cartel.
