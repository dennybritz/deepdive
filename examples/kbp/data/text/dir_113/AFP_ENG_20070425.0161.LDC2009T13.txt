South Korean and Vietnamese builders on Wednesday broke ground on
what is set to be a modern, two-billion-dollar satellite town
west of Hanoi, officials from the joint venture company said.


The Bac An Khanh residential area, set to feature office towers
and 7,751 homes, is a 50-50 joint venture of Korea's POSCO
Construction and Engineering Co and the Vietnam Construction
Import-Export Corp (Vinaconex), they said.


Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem attended the
ground-breaking ceremony for the new town expected to ease
pressure on the city of 3 million people, said officials of the
Bac An Khanh Urban Joint Venture Company.


The residential and office area, due for completion in 2013, will
be located on nearly 270 hectares (670 acres) of land in Ha Tay
province, nine kilometers (six miles) west of communist Vietnam's
capital, they said in a press release.


Information in the statement conflicted with media reports from
South Korea, citing POSCO, which said the project would also
include a 75-storey office tower, cost 2.8 billion dollars and be
set for completion by 2020.


No officials involved in the project were available for comment
on Wednesday, according to media relations personnel at the Bac
An Khanh Urban Joint Venture Company who spoke with AFP on
condition they not be named.
