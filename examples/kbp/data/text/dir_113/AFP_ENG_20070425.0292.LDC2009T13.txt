Six Austrian athletes caught doping at the 2006 Turin Winter
Olympics were banned for life Wednesday, the International
Olympic Committee said.


"The Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee today
unanimously decided to declare permanently ineligible six
athletes from the Austrian biathlon and cross country teams who
competed in the Torino 2006 Olympic Winter Games," an IOC

The athletes were caught in possession of drug paraphernalia as
well as actual performance enhancing drugs, Thomas Bach, the head
of the IOC's disciplinary commission, told a press conference
