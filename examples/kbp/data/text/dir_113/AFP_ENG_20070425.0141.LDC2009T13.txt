A bomb struck an Afghan army vehicle in southeastern Afghanistan
Wednesday, killing six soldiers, an army commander said, in the
latest attack linked to a raging Taliban insurgency.


Hours earlier a district governor in the same province, Paktika,
survived a suicide attack close to his vehicle that killed the
bomber only.


"A roadside bomb struck an Afghan National Army vehicle. Six ANA
soldiers were martyred in the blast and one was wounded," army
commander Murad Ali told AFP.


"This is work of the enemies of Afghanistan," he said, using a
term that refers to the extremist Taliban movement waging an
insurgency that sees almost daily attacks.


The suicide attacker blew himself up close to the vehicle of a
district governor of Paktika, which is on the border with
Pakistan, as the official was travelling to work.


"Luckily no one was hurt in the suicide attack," the interior
ministry said in a statement.


Southern and southeastern Afghanistan have seen most of the
strikes by Taliban, ousted from government in late 2001.


The insurgents rely on roadside and suicide bombings targeted
mainly at Afghan security forces and the thousands of foreign
troops here to help them.
