The Netherlands has lowered its terrorism alert level from
"substantial" to "limited" the justice ministry announced
Wednesday.


"The limited level means that the chance of a terrorist attack is
relatively slight, though by no means impossible. The decision to
lower the threat level was taken following a careful evaluation
of all available intelligence on the subject," the national anti-
terrorism coordinator NCTB said in a statement.


According to the statement jihadist networks in the Netherlands
have been "fairly quiet".


"A number of these networks are now defunct, as a result of
interventions by law enforcement authorities, internal divisions
or a lack of leadership," it said.


Recent terrorism convictions and the fact that the so-called
Hofstad group network was placed on the EU terrorism list coupled
with recent deportations of terrorism suspects also meant few new
would-be terrorist were being recruited, the NCTB said.


Last December four Islamic militants were sentenced to up to
eight years in prison for planning attacks on politicians and the
Dutch intelligence services. Mohammed Bouyeri, the leader of the
so-called Hofstad group network is serving a life sentence for
the 2004 murder of outspoken Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh.
