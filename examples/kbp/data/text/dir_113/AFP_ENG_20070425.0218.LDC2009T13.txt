Spain's trade deficit, one of the highest in the 13-nation euro
zone, rose 5.9 percent in February to 6.9 billion euros (9.4
billion US dollars), the industry ministry said Wednesday.


During the first two months of 2007 the deficit hit 14.5 billion
euros, an increase of 10.9 percent over the same period last
year, the ministry said in a statement.


Exports rose 6.2 percent in February over the same month last
year to 14.8 billion euros while imports were up 6.1 percent at
21.7 billion euros.


Last week Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said
Spain's growing current account deficit, fueled by high oil
prices, corporate borrowing and a consumer spending spree, was
one of the nation's biggest economic challenges.


"The current account deficit is the product of an increase in
national investment. The situation is not without its risks," he
said in an otherwise upbeat assessment of the Spanish economy
delivered at the nation's stock exchange.
