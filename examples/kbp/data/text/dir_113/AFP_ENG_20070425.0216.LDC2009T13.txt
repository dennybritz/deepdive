Japanese bank Resona Holidays said Wednesday that it will sell
350 billion yen (3.0 billion dollars) of shares to US investment
bank Merrill Lynch to raise funds to repay public loans.


Resona, Japan's fourth largest bank, said it would issue 100,000
new preferred shares to Merrill Lynch Japanese Finance Co., a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street giant, for 3.5 million
yen per share.


The sale aims to raise cash to accelerate the repayment of the
public funds of almost 2.0 trillion yen that Resona still owes
the Japanese state.


Resona, formed in 2002 by the merger of Daiwa Bank Holdings and
Asahi Bank, was rescued with a publicly-funded bailout the
following year that effectively nationalised the ailing bank.
