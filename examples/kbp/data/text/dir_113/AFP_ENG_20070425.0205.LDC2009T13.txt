At least 30 people were killed and 15 injured Wednesday when the
bus they were travelling in plunged into a mountain river in
India's Kashmir region, officials said.


The accident was apparently caused by the driver losing control
of the overloaded small bus and veering off the road into the
Poonch river.


The accident occurred 220 kilometres (136 miles) northwest of
Kashmir's winter capital Jammu, police and defence officials
said.


Road accidents are common in India due to bad roads, overloaded
public transport and reckless driving.
