The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index broke the
13,000-point barrier for the first time in opening deals
Wednesday as investors cheered a flurry of upbeat profit reports.


The leading blue chip index soared to 13,019.11 points several
minutes after the opening bell was rung on the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange, spiking 65.17 points, or 0.50 percent, in
initial trading.


Traders said the record high was psychologically important for
the market and would likely help underpin robust trading
sentiment.
