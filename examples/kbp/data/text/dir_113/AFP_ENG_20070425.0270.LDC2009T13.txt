Zurich's new flagship steamer will remain moored to the quayside
for at least another month because it is quite literally making
waves, its Swiss owners said Wednesday.


The modern, glass-decked "Panta Rhei" -- an ancient Greek phrase
meaning 'everything is in constant flow' -- has failed to live up
to its name since it was launched last month because of
complaints about the size of its bow wave.


Small boat owners and rowers on the normally placid Lake Zurich
complained that when the vessel sailed by they were almost thrown
into the water, while environmentalists said they feared damage
to wildlife on the shoreline.


"Only surfers can rejoice with these big waves," the newspaper
Tages Anzeiger claimed.


The vessel, worth 9.5 million Swiss francs (5.8 million euros,
7.8 million dollars), was taken out of service on April 13 while
Zurich's lake steamer company sorts out the problem.


"We hope to get some information on the boat's problems by the
end of May,"  a company spokesman said.


Engineers called in to inspect the Panta Rhei believe that the
54-metre (178-foot) long, Austrian-made vessel is about 70 tonnes
overweight, increasing its draft and displacing more water than
during tests.


One option under consideration is to remove one of the boat's
three decks, but the steamer company is adamant that it wants
compensation.
