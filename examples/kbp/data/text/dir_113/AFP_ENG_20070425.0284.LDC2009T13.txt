Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld revealed on Wednesday that
the health problems which forced him to retire in 2004 have
returned.


The 58-year-old was only persuaded back to Bayern's helm in
February after Felix Magath was sacked, but the stress of
coaching the German giants is taking its toll on his health once
more and he has already lost two kilos.


Hitzfeld has agreed to coach Bayern next season, but is planning
a major recruitment drive over the summer with his side set to
miss out on a Champions League place next season for the first
time in 11 years.


"I must make sure I don't lose too much weight and I have to make
sure I find my time for switching off and relaxing," Hitzfeld
told German sports magazine Sport-Bild in the wake of his side's
2-0 defeat at VfB Stuttgart last weekend.


"It's too easy to not be able to see the wood for the trees when
the pressure of the job starts building up."


Although the stomach complaint which affected him in 2004 is
showing signs of returning, the 2001 World Coach of the Year is
managing his condition with relaxation.


"After spending the whole day dealing with football, I make sure
I switch off after 8pm and do something completely different,
read or just relax," he said.


But Hitzfeld stressed he is enjoying his time back with Bayern.


"I am proud to be Bayern coach. It is a lot of fun, even if it
doesn't always seem so at the time."
