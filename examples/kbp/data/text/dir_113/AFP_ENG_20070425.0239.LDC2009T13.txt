Fed-up residents of a downtown Madrid street known for its sex
trade have threatened to post video images of prostitutes and
their clients on the Internet in an effort to drive them away,
Spanish media reported Wednesday.


Members of an association of residents of Montera street said
they planned to install web cameras on their balconies and then
post clips on video sharing sites like Youtube, daily newspapers
El Pais and ABC reported.


The busy street, located in a neighbourhood that mixes sex shops,
movie theatres and fast food outlets, has long been a centre for
prostitution in Madrid.


But up until a few years ago most prostitutes who worked in the
area were Spanish or from Latin America.


Now residents say the street is increasingly being used by
prostitutes from Eastern Europe and their pimps who are more
aggressive. Residents are regularly threatened and insulted by
the newer sex trade workers, the papers said.


The plan could go against Spain's privacy laws which impose
strict controls on the use of surveillance cameras in public
areas.
