The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday defended
the Beijing Games' torch route, after four Americans were
reportedly detained after protesting against a planned leg over
Mount Everest.


The official torch relay plan will be revealed Thursday here and
senior IOC member Hein Verbruggen said "a lot of people will be
happy" with the announcement.


"Every country that gets the torch relay is very excited,"
Verbruggen told a press conference.


Earlier Wednesday four Americans were detained at Mount Everest
base camp  after erecting a banner that read "One World, One
Dream, Free Tibet 2008", the New York-based Students For A Free
Tibet organisation said.


'One world, one dream,' is an official Beijing Olympic slogan.
Other similar banners in Chinese and Tibetan were also unfurled
by the protesters, while one wore a shirt that said "No torch
through Tibet".


The IOC made no comment on the arrests.


"I don't have any comments on this thing. We, as the IOC, don't
want to be involved in any political issues, this is not our
task," said Verbruggen, head of the IOC commission that is
helping Beijing prepare for the 2008 Games.


The Beijing Olympic organising committee has already revealed
that the torch relay route will go over Mount Everest and Tibet.


China has ruled Tibet since sending troops in to "liberate" the
region in 1951.
