Two-thirds of Britons support letting illegal immigrants stay in
the country, so long as they are working, paying tax and have
lived here for more than four years, a survey out Wednesday
suggested.


The Home Office estimates that there are between 310,000 and
570,000 illegal immigrants in Britain and the efficiency of the
kingdom's immigration system is a regular hot topic in domestic
politics.


The poll of 1,004 British adults for the Citizen Organising
Foundation found that only 21 percent thought the government was
doing a good job at handling immigration.


The foundation is an umbrella group of labour and religious
bodies as part of its campaign for a two-year work permit for
immigrants who have been in Britain for more than four years.


"What this poll shows is that British people welcome immigrants
who work and who are part of society," said the campaign's co-
ordinator Austen Ivereigh.


Last month Britain unveiled a series of measures to crack down on
illegal immigration, including a system whereby immigrants will
be reminded about their visas by mobile telephone text message.


It came as part of a new strategy between government, police,
local authorities and health providers to deny illegal immigrants
access to work, state aid and other services.
