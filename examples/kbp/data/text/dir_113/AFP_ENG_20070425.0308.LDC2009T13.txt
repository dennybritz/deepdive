A bomb blast ripped through a bus station in the eastern
Indonesian city of Ambon late Wednesday injuring six people, one
seriously, witnesses said.


The blast coincided with a key anniversary for pro-independence
rebels, which had prompted tight security on the island.


The six injured, including an 11-year-old boy, were taken to Al-
Fatah hospital in Ambon, witnesses said.


"At the moment, six people are injured and they have been taken
to hospital. One of them is a child," a witness told AFP.


Local police spokesman Napitupulu told ElShinta radio that the
small explosion occurred at 8.30 pm (1130 GMT) and police were at
the scene questioning witnesses.


About 6,000 soldiers and police earlier in the day fanned out
across the island in case of unrest for the anniversary.


April 25 marks the 57th anniversary of the claim by the outlawed
rebels to an independent South Maluku Republic, a territory
covering the eastern Maluku island chain.
