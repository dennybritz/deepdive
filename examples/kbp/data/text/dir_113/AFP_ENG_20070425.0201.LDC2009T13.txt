Twenty people have been killed in election-related violence so
far ahead of May 14 Philippine congressional and local elections,
police said Wednesday.


The police have also recorded 82 cases of election-related
violence this year, said Chief Superintendent Samuel Pagdilao.


The figures fall short of the 249 cases of violence and 148
deaths registered in the presidential elections in 2004 and the
269 incidents and 111 deaths in the congressional and local
elections in 2001, Pagdilao said.


Police checkpoints and raids intended to stem the violence have
resulted in the arrest of 1,883 people and the seizure of 1,762
firearms, 177 explosives and 291 other deadly weapons, Pagdilao
added.


Elections in the Philippines are often marred by violence as
rival political groups use force to intimidate voters or to
battle followers of other candidates.


Pagdilao did not give a breakdown of the fatalities in the
election violence.


Earlier this month, a gubernatorial candidate was shot dead in
the northern province of Kalinga while an election official was
murdered in the western island of Palawan.
