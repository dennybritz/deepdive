Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki arrived in Oman Wednesday on
the latest leg of a regional tour, an Iraqi diplomat said.


Maliki is due to hold talks with Oman's Sultan Qaboos, the
diplomat told AFP without giving further details.


Maliki flew into Muscat from Kuwait, where he called on leaders
of the oil-rich Gulf emirate to write off billions of dollars in
debt and to reopen their embassy in Baghdad, officials said.


He had earlier visited Egypt.


Asked before leaving Kuwait whether construction of a
controversial wall around the Sunni district of Adhamiyah in
Baghdad had stopped, Maliki said: "We said before coming here
that it must stop and other measures taken to protect people
living in Adhamiyah. We will go back to Baghdad and follow up the
issue, God willing."


Maliki had vowed in remarks in Egypt Sunday to halt the project.


"I am opposed to the building of the wall and its construction is
going to stop," he said.


US officials say the wall is designed to be temporary and that
its construction is supported by the Iraqi security forces.
