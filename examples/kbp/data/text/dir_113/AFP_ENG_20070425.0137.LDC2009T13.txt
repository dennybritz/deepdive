positive.


The company said net profit in the first three months of the year
came to 550 million kroner (67.9 million euros, 93 million
dollars) compared with 467 million kroner in first quarter 2006.


"Prospects for the next three to five years remain positive,"

and exceeding market expectations of 714 million.


Aker Kvaerner shares gained 2.37 percent to reach 140.50 kroner

quarter 2006.
