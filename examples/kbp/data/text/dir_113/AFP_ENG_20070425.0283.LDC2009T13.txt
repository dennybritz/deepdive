Taiwan food and drink giant Uni-President Enterprises said
Wednesday it had bought a stake in popular Vietnamese beverage
firm Tribeco as part of its plans to expand in the Southeast
Asian country.


The 13 percent stake in listed Saigon Beverages Joint Stock Co.
-- better known as Tribeco -- cost 70 million Taiwan dollars (2.1
million US), Uni-President said in a statement.


"Vietnam's market potential is huge. Over the past two years,
Vietnam's tea market surged more than 50 percent a year," Uni-
President spokeswoman Selina Wu said.


"Through the strategic alliance, we hope Uni-President can tap
the fast expanding market."


The investment is part of the Taiwanese conglomerate's plans to
turn itself into the largest food group in Asia, excluding Japan,
over the next three to five years.


Uni-President has invested about 350 million US dollars in
projects on the Chinese mainland since 1992.
