Deposed Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra turned up
Wednesday for the opening of a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course
outside Beijing looking relaxed despite his mounting legal
troubles back home.


Thaksin followed the golfing legend in taking the ceremonial
inaugural tee shots on the second course at Pine Valley golf
club.


However his time since the end of his political career appeared
not to have been spent on improving his golf game, as his drive
ducked left in an awful hook.


Reporters were unable to ask him about sport or politics as he
avoided them after the ceremony.


Golf course officials said Thaksin had no connection with the
club but was there at the invitation of an Asia Golf Club
Association official who was a personal friend.


Thaksin, a former telecoms magnate, was abroad last September
when a bloodless military coup deposed him amid allegations of
massive corruption and he has since bounced between Europe and
Asia.


Prosecutors have already filed tax evasion charges against his
wife and two of his children.


New Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said this month that charges
against Thaksin himself could be filed soon, accusing him of
abusing state power, widespread corruption, curtailing media
freedoms and human rights abuses.
