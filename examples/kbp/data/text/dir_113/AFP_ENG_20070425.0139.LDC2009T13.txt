Britain's economy grew 0.7 percent in the first quarter of this
year compared with the final three months of 2006, bolstered by a
strong showing in the services sector, according to official data
published on Wednesday.


Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.8 percent during the three
months to March 31, 2007 from the same quarter in the previous
year, the Office for National Statistics said in an initial
estimate.


The quarterly figure was stronger then analysts' consensus
forecasts for growth of 0.6 percent, while the annual reading was
in line with market expectations.


"GDP growth was stable at 0.7 percent quarter-on-quarter in the
first quarter, led by continuing robust service sector activity,"
noted Global Insight economist Howard Archer.
