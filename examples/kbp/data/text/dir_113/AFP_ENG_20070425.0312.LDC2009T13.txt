Iraqi President Jalal Talabani added his voice on Wednesday to a
chorus of criticism of moves by US and Iraqi troops to build a
security barrier around a Sunni enclave in Baghdad.


"I do not agree on such barriers. I don't believe this is
something good. We can set up less harsh barriers," he told a
press conference in the northern Kurdish city of Sulaimaniyah.


Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has already ordered a halt to
construction of a five-kilometre (three-mile) wall of concrete
blocks around the Adhamiyah district which US commanders say is
designed to protect the public.


Street protesters in Sunni Adhamiyah and nearby Shiite Sadr City
accuse the Americans of seeking to carve the Iraqi capital into
sectarian enclaves, but Iraqi and US spokesmen say it is designed
to foil attacks by militants.
