President Jalal Talabani on Wednesday added his voice to a chorus
of criticism of moves by US and Iraqi military to build a
security barrier around a Sunni enclave in Baghdad.


"I do not agree on such barriers. I don't believe this is
something good. We can set up less harsh barriers," Talabani
said, in a statement from his office.


Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has already ordered a halt to
construction on a five-kilometre (three-mile) wall of concrete
blocks around the Adhamiyah district which US commanders say is
designed to protect the public.


Street protesters in Sunni Adhamiyah and nearby Shiite Sadr City
accuse the Americans of seeking to carve the Iraqi capital into
sectarian enclaves, but Iraqi and US spokesmen say it is designed
to foil extremist attacks.
