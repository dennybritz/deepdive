World sport's top court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal by
Turkish club Galatasary against French international Franck
Ribery's move to Marseille in 2005.


The Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) said in a statement that
Ribery had terminated his contract with the Turkish club on just
grounds, and that Galatasaray was not entitled to any
compensation.


The 26-year-old midfielder had signed a three-and-a-half year
deal with the Turkish side in January 2005 before signing up with
Marseille just five months later.


Galatasaray had claimed that Ribery was at fault when he broke
his contract having not been paid for over four months. The
Istanbul side was reportedly claiming 10 million euros in
compensation from Marseille.


The Turkish club appealed to CAS after football's world governing
body FIFA dismissed their case last November.


Ribery, who has generated strong interest from Lyon, Real Madrid
and Arsenal, is again under the transfer spotlight after
Marseille president Pape Diouf signalled that he would let his
star winger leave at the end of the season if he wants.
