Nigeria's presidential poll was marred by a late start, a
shortage of ballot papers, widespread voter intimidation, the
seizure of ballot boxes by thugs and vote buying, a prominent
rights group said Wednesday.


"Researchers in two northern states observed widespread violence
and vote- rigging that was mirrored throughout the country," New
York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.


"Instead of guaranteeing citizens' basic right to vote freely,
the Nigerian government and electoral officials actively colluded
in the fraud and violence that marred the presidential polls in
some areas," HRW Africa director Peter Takirambudde said in a
statement.


"In other areas, officials closed their eyes to human rights
abuses committed by supporters of the ruling party and others,"
the statement continued.


HRW is the latest in a series of bodies that monitored the poll
to express harsh criticism of the way it was conducted.


Groups ranging from the European Union to the Commonwealth have
slammed irregularities in the April 21 poll and even outgoing
President Olusegun Obasanjo has admitted the poll was flawed.
