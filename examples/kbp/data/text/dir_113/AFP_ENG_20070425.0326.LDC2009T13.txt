The French village of Donzy has done again what it has done in
every presidential election since 1981 -- accurately reflect the
nation's vote in the first round of the vote.


On Sunday the Burgundy village of 1,700 people voted 29.7 percent
for Nicolas Sarkozy; 24.3 percent for Segolene Royal; 18.9
percent for Francois Bayrou; and 11.7 percent for Jean-Marie Le
Pen.


Given a few decimal points here or there, this was the same as
the nationwide result.


There was even one vote for Gerard Schivardi, the candidate of
the Trotskyite Workers' party who had 0.37 percent in the country
as a whole.


"It must be something in the water," joked Frederic Coudray, 39,
who produces foie gras at a Donzy farm.


"And if you want my prediction for the run-off between Sarkozy
and Royal, I think we're going to vote straight down the middle.
Wait and see -- it'll be exactly 50-50 on May 6," he said.
