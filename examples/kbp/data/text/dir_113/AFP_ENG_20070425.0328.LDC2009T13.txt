Greek police on Wednesday detained dozens of Iraqi immigrants in
Athens in an operation that followed a tipoff on a possible
attack on the US embassy here, a police source said.


Though the warning provided by an Iraqi man was apparently
groundless, the US embassy was closed for the day while police
carried out house searches around the Greek capital.


Of 11 migrants initially detained in the operation, six were
found to be without residency papers and will be deported, the
public order ministry said in a statement.


Another 53 undocumented migrants were detained following a raid
on a central Athens building offering housing to alien citizens,
the ministry said.


All the detainees are from Iraq, the police source said.


It was not immediately clear whether any of the detentions were
linked to the attack warning, which caused the US embassy to be
sealed off for hours.


In a statement, the US embassy said the building "is closed today
in precaution because of security information related
specifically to the embassy facilities."


In January, a Greek far-left group fired an anti-tank rocket
against the embassy in a pre-dawn attack, but nobody was injured.


Greece and the United States have offered a combined two-million
dollar reward for information on the group, Revolutionary
Struggle, which is the country's most dangerous extremist unit in
operation.


Revolutionary Struggle, which first emerged in 2003, has been
responsible for seven incidents in Athens which have left three
people slightly injured.
