Infosys Technologies, India's second-largest software company,
said Thursday it has opened a new "nearshoring" facility in the
Czech Republic to better serve its European clients.


The 400-person facility, opened by Czech President Vaclav Klaus
in the city of Brno, will process transactions for European
clients as well as provide software and related services,
Bangalore-based Infosys said.


"The Brno centre is part of our strategy to build nearshore
centres in various parts of the globe," said Mohandas Pai, who
heads Infosys BPO, the business process outsourcing arm of the
company.


"This, along with our large offshore centres in India and the
centre in China, gives us an expanded global network, allowing
proximity to our clients," Pai added in the statement.


"Nearshoring" is a form of outsourcing, where a company moves
part of its operation to a relatively cheap site, whose location
is closer than conventional outsourcing locations such as India.


The centre, which expands on Infosys' presence since 2004 in
Brno, will service clients in the automotive, manufacturing,
banking and capital markets and insurance sectors.
