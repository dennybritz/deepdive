Greek riot police restored order on Wednesday to most of the
prison at the centre of two days of violent protests that spread
throughout the country, the Greek public order ministry said.


Squads of riot police went into the high security Malandrino
prison, around 200 kilometres (124 miles) northwest of Athens,
early Wednesday.


They gained control of most of the complex though 100 inmates
remained on a roof top for a third day.


Trouble in Greece's prison system spread throughout the country
after a young inmate in Malandrino, linked to an Athens bank
robbery shootout in 2006, was allegedly beaten by guards on
Monday.


Hundreds of inmates joined mass protests in another ten prisons
that prompted a countrywide crackdown on Tuesday.


Order was largely restored in prisons in Athens, on the Ionian
island of Corfu, the Aegean island of Crete, the central towns of
Larissa and Trikala, the western city of Patras, the northern
city of Salonika and the northeastern town of Komotini by the end
of Tuesday.


Three inmates were injured in a police operation in the high
security prison of Korydallos in Athens. Police use of tear gas,
led to complaints from the local authorities as the prison lies
in a dense city zone.


Four Korydallos prison guards were hospitalised with breathing
problems.


Prisoners in Malandrino made a series of demands for reduced
sentences and longer leave but this was rejected by the Greek
justice ministry.
