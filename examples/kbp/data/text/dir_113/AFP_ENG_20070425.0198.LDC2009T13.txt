China on Wednesday denounced a new bid by its political rival
Taiwan to join the World Health Organisation under the name
"Taiwan," state media reported.


"We strongly oppose such activities," Taiwan Affairs Office
spokesman Yang Yi said in comments quoted by Xinhua news agency.


"As a part of China, Taiwan is not eligible to join the WHO as a
member or quasi-member. Neither is it qualified to join the WHO
as an observer," Yang said.


Taiwan said last week it was planning to launch a new bid to join
the World Health Assembly, the highest decision-making body of
the WHO, and also apply for WHO membership.


China regards Taiwan as part of its territory although the two
sides have been ruled separately since nationalist Kuomintang
forces lost a civil war to the communists in 1949 and fled to the
island off China's coast.


Since 1997, Taipei's annual attempts to become an observer at the
WHA as a "health entity" have been thwarted by Beijing.


Taiwan authorities plan to use WHO membership as a ploy aimed at
elevating their secessionist activities to an international
forum, Xinhua quoted Yang as saying.


Taiwan was evicted from the WHO in 1972, a year after losing the
"China" seat in the United Nations to Beijing.


The island's government led by pro-independence President Chen
Shui-bian recently launched a campaign to expunge the word
"China" from the names of state firms, replacing it with
"Taiwan."


The move sparked fierce invective from China, which views it as a
further attempt to "split the motherland."
