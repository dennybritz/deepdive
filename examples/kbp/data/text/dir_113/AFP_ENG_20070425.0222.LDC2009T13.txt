European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso plans an informal
"brainstorming session" with European leaders next month to
discuss the EU's constitution and future challenges, a
spokeswoman said Wednesday.


Barroso is inviting selected leaders to the informal mini-summit
on May 12-13 in Sintra, Portugal, which is the Commission
president's home country and which hold the EU's next six-month
presidency from July, said spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde.


She declined to name which EU leaders had been invited but said
that "the participation will be balanced and representative" and
that "it's good not to be too numerous."
