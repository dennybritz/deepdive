Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as former US presidents
Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush on Wednesday attended the
funeral service of Boris Yeltsin ahead of the burial of the first
post-Soviet Russian leader.


Putin and the foreign dignitaries gathered at the side of
Yeltsin's coffin in Moscow's Christ the Saviour cathedral.


"The destiny of Boris Nikolayevich reflected the dramatic history
of the 20th century," said the officiating metropolitan bishop,
referring to Yeltsin by his Russian patronymic, as he intoned
details of the former Russian leader's life.


"The desire of our people to live in freedom was very strong and
Boris Nikolayevich felt this and he helped to bring this about,"
declared the bishop, dressed in white robes trimmed with gold.


"Being a strong character he took responsibility for the country
at a difficult and dangerous time of radical changes," he said.


Russia "is returning to its great traditions. This is shown by
the fact that for the first time in many years we are bidding
farewell to the head of state in a church," he said.


Dignitaries including Putin, Clinton, Bush senior and former
British prime minister John Major stood in silence holding
candles as a choir sang mourning chants for the dead leader.


Yeltsin was later to be buried at a historic cemetery for
distinguished Russians.


Credited with overseeing the Soviet Union's demise and the
introduction of democratic freedoms in Russia, Yeltsin has been
accorded full honours by Putin's government.
