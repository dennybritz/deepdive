Carlos Moya won a battle of longtime Spanish rivals as he
overcame Felix Mantilla 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the third round of
the Barcelona Open on Wednesday.


Former French Open winner Moya lifted the trophy at the Real club
in 2003, while the 32-year-old Mantilla won it four years
earlier.


The encounter between players who know each other's games inside
out lasted just over two hours as Moya won for the ninth time in
14 meetings dating back a dozen years.


The winner, who fired nine aces, next faces a meeting with
Argentine fourth seed David Nalbandian.


The 16th-seeded Moya also claimed the pair's most recent meeting
two years ago on clay at Estoril.


He improved to 17-9 on the season with a season-best runner-up at
Sydney against James Blake. for his 32nd win in Barcelona.


Mantilla missed all of last year due to skin cancer, but made a
winning return in his first ATP match since the 2005 US Open by
defeating Uzbekistan qualifier Farrukh Dustov this week.


Mantilla was once ranked tenth in the world, earning ten titles.


Russian number two Nikolay Davydenko struggled against qualifier
Yuri Schukin, dealing with a shoulder worry before scratching out
a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 second-round win after a bye.


Schukin, 27 and 218, was making his first ATP appearance of the
season.


Argentine eighth seed Juan Chela put out American Vince Spadea
6-3, 6-3 while Italy's Filippo Volandri upset 14th seed Nicolas
Almagro 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-1 ten days after the Spaniard won the
home Valencia trophy.


Rafael Nadal was putting his 67-match win streak on the line
against Kristof Vliegen as the pair meet for the second time in
two weeks.
