South Africa captain Graeme Smith elected to bat after winning
the toss against Australia in the World Cup semi-final at the
Beausejour Stadium here on Wednesday.


It is the second meeting between the two teams in the ongoing
tournament, with Australia beating South Africa in a group match
at St Kitts last month.


Defending champions Australia are aiming for a hat-trick, having
won the title in 1999 in England and 2003 in South Africa.


It is South Africa's third appearance in the Cup semi-final since
their debut in 1992.
