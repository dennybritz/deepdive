The world's top Internet search engine, Google, said Wednesday
that it will offer online advertisement service for over 400
websites under China's largest Internet service provider China
Telecom.


The partnership "is the first step for broader and more in-depth
cooperation between China Telecom and Google," the two companies
said in a statement.


No financial details for the deal was provided.


China's Internet users rose to 137 million as of the end of 2007,
ranking second only to the United States as the world's largest
Internet market.


In January 2007, Google forged an alliance with China Mobile, the
country's largest handset operator to provide mobile and Internet
services in China, allowing searches on the Chinese firm's
Monternet WAP portal.


However, the competition is fierce. In December, Microsoft and
Chinese Internet search portal Baidu joined forces, with
Microsoft to display Baidu search advertising on its MSN, Live
and other websites in China.


Online auction site eBay announced late last year it was
downgrading its presence in China, handing control of its main
website to Beijing-based wireless services group TOM Online.
