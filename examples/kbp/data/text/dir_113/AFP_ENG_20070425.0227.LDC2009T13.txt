British police officers swooped in pre-dawn raids across the
country on Wednesday, aimed at taking out major crack cocaine
dealers in an international drugs chain.


More than 400 officers were involved, smashing their way into
homes in an attempt to break a network ferrying drugs from
Jamaica through London to Middlesbrough in north-east England for
distribution across the region.


Cleveland Police, which covers Middlesbrough, said it was one of
the most wide- ranging operations of its kind in Britain.


Police said 21 people were arrested, six in east London and 15 in
northern England.


"Today's action strikes at the very heart of a lucrative drugs
network," said Cleveland Police Chief Constable Sean Price.


"The aim is to take out not just street-level dealers, but the
masterminds behind this evil trade."


Detective Inspector Dave Lamplough, of Cleveland Police's
Organised Crime Unit, said: "The vast majority of the people
being targeted today are Jamaican.


"We have hammered away at the bottom end in the past but this
time we have the information we need to target key people. We are
taking out the whole network."


Britain has the worst level of drug abuse in Europe, and the
second highest level of drug-related deaths, a report said last
week.


The value of trade in illegal drugs was estimated at five billion
pounds (10 billion dollars, 7.3 billion euros) a year, according
to the study by Professor Peter Reuter of the University of
Maryland in the United States and Alex Stevens of the University
of Kent in south-east England.
