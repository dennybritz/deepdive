German Economy Minister Michael Glos warned on Wednesday that a
continued rise in the euro would present a danger to German
growth but added that the currency's present level was
sustainable.


He was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high
point against the dollar, soaring to 1.3656 Wednesday, well
within striking distance of 1.3666, its record level reached
December 30, 2004.


Citing Germany's robust export performance, Glos said the present
level of the euro was "sustainable." A stronger currency can
threaten a country's exports, making them more expensive and less
competitive on world markets.


But Glos warned: "If it (the euro) were to rise still more
strongly, there would be risks."
