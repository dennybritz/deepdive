The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index broke the
13,000-point barrier for the first time in opening deals
Wednesday as investors cheered a flurry of upbeat profit reports.


The leading blue chip index soared to 13,019.11 points several
minutes after the opening bell was rung on the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange, spiking 65.17 points, or 0.50 percent, in
initial trading.


Traders said the record high was psychologically important for
the market and would likely help underpin robust trading
sentiment despite concerns about US economic growth.


The tech-laden Nasdaq composite had soared 9.84 points (0.39
percent) to 2,534.38 in early frenzied deal-making, and the
broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index had gained 6.24 points
(0.42 percent) to 1,486.65.


The US stock market has rocketed higher in the past week as
investors have applauded a flow of strong profit reports from
corporate America and several big mergers and acquisitions.


An acquisition binge by big private equity firms has also fueled
Wall Street's optimism.


The good news for shareholders continued Wednesday as Boeing Co.
said its first-quarter profits soared 28 percent from a year ago
to 877 million dollars as new aircraft orders boomed.


Strong first quarter earnings from ConocoPhillips, Colgate-
Palmolive, PepsiCo and online retailer Amazon.com also propelled
stocks higher in early activity, traders said.


However, some analysts have cautioned that the wider US economic
picture is not so rosy. The world's biggest economy has slowed
markedly in the past year amid a downturn in the housing market.
