Two Italian journalists arrested in the Nigerian federal capital
Abuja while covering elections in Africa's largest democracy have
been released, the Italian foreign ministry said Wednesday.


Emanuele Piano and Marco Ricchello, freelance journalists for the
leftist daily Liberazione, were arrested at their hotel earlier
in the day, the local ANSA news agency quoted the foreign
ministry as saying.


Piano, 35, informed the newspaper by SMS text message, ANSA said.


Piano later told the Sky TG24 Italian television news channel
that they had been questioned for several hours by security
officials who did not say what they were accused of.


He suggested that officials were annoyed because they had met
local journalists.


Liberazione's editor-in-chief, Claudi Iampaglia, said the
reporters had been covering Saturday's presidential elections in
Nigeria and were to travel to the volatile and oil-rich southern
Niger Delta region where several expatriates, including Italians,
have been kidnapped in recent months.


The European Union, Nigeria's former colonial ruler Britain, the
United States and human rights groups, have expressed concern
over voting irregularities in the latest polls.


At least 200 people died in the two-stage state, presidential and
parliamentary elections on April 14 and 21.


Even outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo, whose handpicked
successor won the presidential ballot, has admitted the polls
were flawed.
