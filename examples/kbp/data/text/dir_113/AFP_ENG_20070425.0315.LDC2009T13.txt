Former Russian president Boris Yeltsin was buried Wednesday at
Moscow's Novodevichy cemetery in a ceremony attended by two
former US presidents and numerous other foreign dignitaries,
Russian television showed.


Yeltsin's casket was lowered into the ground to the accompaniment
of the Russian national anthem and three shots fired from cannons
positioned nearby as his widow, Naina, and two daughters looked
on.
