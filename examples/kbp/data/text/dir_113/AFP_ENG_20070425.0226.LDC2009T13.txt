UN Security Council ambassadors arrived in Brussels Wednesday to
discuss the future of Kosovo with EU and NATO officials, at the
start of a key tour which will also take them to Belgrade and
Pristina.


"As you know, the Security Council decided to have an information
mission going to Belgrade and Pristina in order to have all the
information we need for taking appropriate decisions," Belgium's
UN ambassador Johan Verbeke said as he arrived at the Egmont
Palace in Brussels, where the Belgian forign ministry
traditonally hosts guests.


Security Council resolution 1244, adopted in 1999, authorises the
United Nations to facilitate a political process to determine the
future status of Kosovo, a Serbian province with a predominantly
ethnic-Albanian population.


"We'll be hearing NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer
and representatives" of the European Union, the Belgian
ambassador said.


UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari has recommended supervised
autonomy for the breakaway Serb province of Kosovo, a plan
opposed by both Serbia and Moscow.


Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov said Tuesday the
plan authored by Ahtisaari was unacceptable because of Serbian
opposition and that without revisions the proposal "will not pass
at the UN Security Council" -- where Moscow holds veto power.
