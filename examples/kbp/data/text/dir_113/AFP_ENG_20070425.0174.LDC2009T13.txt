Five thousand people were evacuated Wednesday after a chlorine
leak sent a cloud of noxious fumes over a city in northeast
China, state media said.


The leak occurred early Wednesday morning at a water plant in
Harbin city, the capital of Heilongjiang province, Xinhua news
agency reported, citing the local government.


Local residents complained about a stinging sensation in their
eyes and noses due to the leak, the report said.


About 2,000 students and teachers at a high school near the water
plant were evacuated as well as 3,000 residents in an adjacent
housing complex, it said.


It was not immediately clear if any people had been hospitalised,
it said.


Fire-fighters had arrived at the scene to try to cap the leak,
according to the report.
