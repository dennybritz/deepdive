A bomb ripped through a bus station on Indonesia's Ambon island
late Wednesday injuring six people, witnesses said, amid tight
security for a pro-independence rebel anniversary.


One person was seriously wounded in the blast in Ambon city and
all six were taken to nearby Al-Fatah hospital, witnesses said.


An 11-year-old boy was among the injured.


"At the moment, six people are injured and they have been taken
to hospital. One of them is a child," one witness told AFP.


Local police told ElShinta radio that the small explosion
occurred 8.30 pm (1130 GMT) and officers were at the scene
questioning witnesses.


Nobody immediately claimed responsibility.


Thousands of police and soldiers fanned out across Ambon city and
towns on the island earlier in the day amid concerns of unrest
for the anniversary.


Indonesian Army Chief Djoko Santoso said last week 6,000 police
and military personnel would guard several strategic locations,
particularly in Ambon city, the capital of Malaku province.


Two years ago, a pro-independence parade in the city led to
clashes and a week of violence that left more than 30 people dead
and more than 100 injured.


April 25 marks the 57th anniversary of the claim by the outlawed
rebels to an independent South Maluku Republic, a territory
covering the eastern Maluku island chain.


The separatist movement was crushed shortly after its declaration
in 1950 but the rebels regrouped following the fall of dictator
Suharto in 1998.


Ambon has also been ravaged by clashes between Muslims and
Christians, which erupted in January 1999.


A peace pact in February 2002 mostly ended three years of strife
that left more than 5,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands
homeless.
