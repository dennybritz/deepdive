International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge insisted
Wednesday the Olympics were a force for good despite boycott
calls and protests over China's hosting of next year's Games.


"We believe that the Olympic Games will have definitely a
positive, lasting effect on Chinese society and this has been
recognised by our Chinese friends and their partners," Rogge told
a press conference here.


"So definitely we believe the Games are a force for the good in
every country in which they are held."


He was speaking after four Americans were arrested at Mount
Everest on Wednesday for protesting against plans to run the 2008
Olympic torch relay through Tibet.


The Tibetan independence activists were detained at Mount Everest
base camp after erecting a banner that read "One World, One
Dream, Free Tibet 2008," the New York-based Students For A Free
Tibet organisation said in a statement.


The Beijing Olympics has also faced boycott calls over China's
links to the government of Sudan, accused of abetting genocide in
the Darfur region.
