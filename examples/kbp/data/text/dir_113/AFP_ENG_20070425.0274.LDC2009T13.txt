Arab Israeli leader Azmi Bishara is being probed for allegedly
helping Hezbollah during the recent war in Lebanon, police
sources said Wednesday, after a gag order on details of an
inquiry was lifted.


"He's under investigation on suspicion of assisting an enemy
during a time of war and contacting an enemy agent, of money
laundering and financing terror," the sources told AFP.


They were speaking after an Israeli court in the town of Petah
Tikva partially lifted a gag order on details of an investigation
into Bishara, who resigned his seat in the Israeli parliament
earlier this week.


"He's suspected of passing information onto Hezbollah during the
second Lebanon war and receiving money in exchange," the police
sources added.
