US scientists have identified two genes responsible for macular
degeneration, the gradual deterioration of eyesight in the
elderly that can lead to blindness, a study showed this week.


The research published Tuesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association also showed that smoking and being overweight
carry a strong risk of the condition, in which the central part
of the eye's retina degenerates.


It was carried out on 1,466 people suffering from the condition,
aged 55 to 80 in several US hospitals over 11 years, from 1990 to
2001.


Subsequent study of the gene types in those surveyed revealed
that mutations in two particular genes -- identified as CFHY402H
and LOC387715 -- were linked to a worsening of the condition.


Smoking and being overweight increased by 19 times the risk of
aggravated macular degeneration, said the study's main author,
Johanna Seddon of the Tufts- New England Medical Center in
Boston.
