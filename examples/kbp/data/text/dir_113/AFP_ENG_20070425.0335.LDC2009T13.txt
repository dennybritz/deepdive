Zambia President Levy Mwanawasa criticised the country's anti-
corruption commission on Wednesday saying it was taking too long
over cases involving former senior government officials.


"I am not satisfied with the performance of the ACC," Mwanawasa
said, using the acronym for Zambia's Anti-Corruption Commission.


The Zambian leader, who has made the fight against graft the
cornerstone of his government's efforts, said it was unacceptable
that some files were taking more than five years to work their
way through the court system.


"When I was a lawyer, no case used to take five years ... but
this is happening now," a visibly upset Mwanawasa said at a
swearing-in ceremony for the new head of the ACC, Justice
Valentine Chileshe.


Several corruption cases have been pending for a number of years,
including one involving former president Frederick Chiluba who is
accused of stealing millions of dollars in state funds.


Mwanawasa asked the anti-corruption unit to meet with the
country's chief justice and senior judges to find ways of
speeding up the prosecution of those accused of corruption and
theft of public funds.


Only three prominent personalities have been jailed by the courts
since Mwanawasa launched his anti-graft drive in 2002 while
several more high-profile cases are still before the courts.
