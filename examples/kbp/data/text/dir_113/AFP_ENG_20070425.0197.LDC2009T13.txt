Spanish league champions Barcelona will take on a Hong Kong
invitational side in a friendly clash this summer, a spokeswoman
for the promoters said Wednesday.


With a promise to field star players like Ronaldinho, the Spanish
league-leaders will play a team drawn from two of Hong Kong's top
sides, Kitchee and Happy Valley.


No date has been set for the match yet and organisers are
awaiting its sanction from the Hong Kong Football Association.


Barcelona will come to Hong Kong as part of an Asian tour, that
so far will also include a match in Japan against a yet-to-be-
decided side. They are also considering an invitation to play in
China, the spokeswoman said.


Organisers wouldn't comment on reports in Britain that the
Spanish giants would be paid the equivalent of 1.2 million pounds
(2.4 million US dollars) to travel here.


Top-flight European clubs like Manchester United and Inter Milan
have made lucrative off-season tours to football-mad Asia in the
past few years.
