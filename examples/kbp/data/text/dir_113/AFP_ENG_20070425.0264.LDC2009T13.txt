Danish cabin crews at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) held a
second day of strike action on Wednesday, causing cancellations
of most SAS flights in and out of Copenhagen, SAS Denmark said.


Nearly all European and intercontinental flights were cancelled
until midnight Wednesday (2200 GMT), the airline added.


Some 15,000-20,000 passengers were estimated to have been hit by
the strike.


The cabin staff walked off the job in a wildcat strike on Tuesday
when 113 flights were cancelled, leaving some 10,000 travellers
stranded. Between 400 and 600 people had to spend the night at
Kastrup airport due to a lack of hotel rooms.


SAS was already hit last month by a similar strike after the
airline failed to reach a collective agreement with the
1,600-member Cabin Attendants Union.


Union chair Verner Lundtoft Hansen said the flight attendants
were "protesting against poor working conditions."


"Staff want to be able to influence the planning of holidays and
days off," Hansen told Danish news agency Ritzau.


"Many attendants have children and only 10 free weekends per
year. They don't want to be forced to take all their holidays at
once," he said.
