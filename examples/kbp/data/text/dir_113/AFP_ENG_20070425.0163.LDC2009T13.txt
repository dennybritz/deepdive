Sydney Roosters broke through for their first win of Australia's
National Rugby League season with an 18-4 victory over St George
Illawarra in the Anzac Day match here Wednesday.


The Roosters ended a run of five straight losses with a morale-
boosting three tries to one win.


The win eased pressure on Roosters coach Chris Anderson but
increased it on Dragons counterpart Nathan Brown, whose side have
now lost five straight games following an opening round win.
