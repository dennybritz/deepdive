Yara International of Norway, the biggest producer of mineral
fertiliser in the world, said Wednesday it had signed a deal with
Libya's National Oil Corporation to create a joint company in
Libya.


The company, which will be run on a parity basis, will produce
and market mineral fertiliser in North African countries by
developing production of urea and ammoniac by the National Oil
Corporation in Marsa el Brega.


The units currently produce around 700,000 tonnes of ammoniac and
900,00O tonnes of urea a year.


Yara is expected under the deal to contribute to the
modernisation of production capacities through new units that NOC
will supply with natural gas.


The joint venture is expected to see the light of day at the end
of 2007, Yara said.
