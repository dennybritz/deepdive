US aviation giant Boeing Co. said Wednesday first-quarter profits
lifted 28 percent from a year ago to 877 million dollars as new
aircraft orders took off.


The profit for the January-March quarter amounted to 1.13 dollars
per share, well ahead of the average Wall Street forecast of 1.02
dollars.


Revenues meanwhile grew eight percent from the comparable period
a year before to 15.4 billion dollars.


The company also reaffirmed its financial outlook for 2007 and
2008, citing strength in its core businesses and a record backlog
for new orders.


"These results are in line with our expectations for the quarter
and represent solid progress toward the high goals we have for
ourselves in 2007 and beyond," said Boeing chairman and chief
executive Jim McNerney.


"Our record backlog, increasing productivity, and the progress of
our development programs have us on track to achieve our growth
and profitability objectives."


Boeing said its backlog at quarter-end reached a record 262
billion dollars, up 23 percent in the past 12 months on strength
of its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft and additional defense orders.
