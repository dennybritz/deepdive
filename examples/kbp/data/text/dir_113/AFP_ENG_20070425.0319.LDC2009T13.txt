The appeals chamber of the UN war crimes court will on May 9
render its verdict in the case of a Bosnian Serb convicted of
genocide over the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, the court said
Wednesday.


If the appeals court confirms the conviction, Vidoje Blagojevic
will be the second person definitively convicted of genocide
charges by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY).


Nearly 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were executed by Bosnian
Serb troops after the fall of the United Nations-protected
Srebrenica enclave in eastern Bosnia on July 11, 1995.


The massacre is the worst single atrocity committed on European
soil since 1945 and the only episode of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia
officially ruled to have been genocide.


According to the judges of the lower trial chamber, Blagojevic
aided and abetted the genocide in Srebrenica.


Since its creation in 1993, the court has only handed down one
definite conviction for aiding and abetting genocide. It
sentenced Bosnian Serb general Radislav Krstic, who led the
troops that took over Srebrenica, to 35 years in prison on April
19, 2004.
