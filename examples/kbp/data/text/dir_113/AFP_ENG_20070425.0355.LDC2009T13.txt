A moderate earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale rocked
areas in the southern Philippines Wednesday, but there were no
reports of damage or casualties.


The quake's epicentre was located 140 kilometres (87 miles)
northeast of Davao City on the island of Mindanao, the state
volcanology and seismology institute said.


There was no damage to property and no tsunami warning was issued
as the quake was measured some 70 kilometres underground.


The Philippines sits on what is commonly referred to as the
Pacific "ring of fire," a zone of frequent earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions that encircles the Pacific Ocean basin.


The South East Asian archipelago nation of 86 million people is
hit daily by earthquakes that are relatively low in magnitude and
cause little or no structural damage.


The last major earthquake to hit the Philippines was on July 16,
1990, when a quake of 7.7 magnitude shattered the northern Luzon
city of Baguio, killing or injuring an estimated 1,000 people.
