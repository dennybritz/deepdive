Contracts ceding control of Bolivia's energy reserves from
foreign companies to its government have come into force, as
President Evo Morales nationalizes the impoverished state's
hydrocarbon industry.


The 44 new contracts were signed in October with 10 companies
including Repsol of Spain, Petrobras of Brazil, Total of France,
Vintage and ExxonMobil of the United States as well as BP and
British Gas of Britain.


They came officially into force on Tuesday when Morales signed
them.


In May 2006, after he was elected on promises to share the gas
wealth with Bolivians, Morales nationalized the industry,
scrapping the old contracts on the grounds that they were not
enforceable under Bolivia's constitution, which prohibits the
state from selling or leasing mineral wealth.


His nationalization decree forced foreign companies to negotiate
new contracts giving Bolivia a majority share of revenues
generated in the energy sector.


Bolivia's Congress formally approved the new contracts on April
19 after political disagreements and mistakes in the documents
had caused major delays.


South America's poorest country, Bolivia has the region's second-
largest natural gas reserves, after Venezuela.


Under the new contracts, the Bolivian YPFB hydrocarbon company
owns the reserves, while the foreign companies act as service
providers. No major foreign companies left the country rather
than accept the new deals, despite a loss of profits.
