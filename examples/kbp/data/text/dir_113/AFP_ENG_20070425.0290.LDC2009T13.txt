Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki hit back Wednesday at a
critical UN human rights report on the situation in his war-torn
country and questioned its credibility.


"The Iraqi government announces that it has major reservations
about this report, which lacks precision in its presentation of
information, lacks credibility in many of its points and lacks
balance in its presentation of the human rights situation in
Iraq," he said in an official statement.


"Despite the Iraqi government's full cooperation and transparency
in dealing with the UN delegation in Iraq, much of the
information contained in the report was not taken from credible
sources," he said.


The United Nations Assistance Mission had earlier criticised
Baghdad for concealing casualty figures for the country's ongoing
sectarian strife and alleged that detainees had disappeared while
in state custody.


The Shiite premier's statement went on to accuse the report of
worsening humanitarian conditions in Iraq rather than improving
them and called on the United Nations to play a "more
constructive role" in the country.


"Considering the conditions which Iraq is currently enduring,
this report calls into question the credibility of the United
Nations office in Iraq, aggravating the humanitarian situation
instead of resolving it," he said.
