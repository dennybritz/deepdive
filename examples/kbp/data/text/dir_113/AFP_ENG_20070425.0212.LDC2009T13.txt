Nigerian authorities Wednesday arrested two Italian journalists
working in the country, the Italian foreign ministry said
Wednesday.


The two, Emanuele Piano and Marco Ricchello, are freelance
journalists for the leftist daily Liberazione.


"We are following the situation. We don't yet know why they were
arrested," a ministry spokesman told AFP. He said they were
arrested by police in the federal capital, Abuja.


Piano, 35, informed the newspaper of his arrest by SMS text
message, the Italian news agency ANSA said.


It quoted the editor in chief of Liberazione, Claudi Iampaglia,
as saying the two had been covering Saturday's presidential
elections in Nigeria and were to travel to the volatile southern
Niger Delta region.
