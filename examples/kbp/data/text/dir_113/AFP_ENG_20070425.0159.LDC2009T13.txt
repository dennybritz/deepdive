The Nigerian government has accused the governor of the
commercial capital, Lagos, Bola Tinubu, for operating foreign
accounts contrary to his oath of office, officials said
Wednesday.


In the suit before the Code of Conduct Tribunal in Abuja on
Tuesday, the government said investigators had linked the
governor with 10 different accounts in banks in Britain and the
United States.


It said Tinubu used cronies like his wife and children to run
illegal accounts which he had not disclosed in assets declaration
documents laid before the tribunal.


It therefore urged the tribunal to convict the governor for
violating the 1999 constitution under which he was elected in
office.


Tinubu, a prominent member of the opposition party Action
Congress (AC), is due to step down next month at the end of his
tenure. A former aide of the governor was elected on April 14 to
take over from him.


Millions of dollars in state funds are believed to have been
stolen from government treasury by officials in the past.


Last month, the head of the country's anti-graft agency EFCC,
Nuhu Ribadu, said some five million dollars had been traced to a
yet-to-be identified governor in Bahamas.


Several governors were barred from contesting the April 14 polls
because of their indictment for corruption by the EFCC.
