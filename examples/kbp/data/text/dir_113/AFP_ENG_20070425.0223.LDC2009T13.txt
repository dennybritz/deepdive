Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua slumped out of the AFC
Champions League Wednesday after a dour goalless draw against
Japan's 10-man Urawa Red Diamonds.


Shenhua, quarter-finalists last year, picked up their first point
in four games but it wasn't enough to keep them in the
continental competition. They needed to win to stand any chance
of reaching the knockout phase.


Group E leaders Urawa dropped their first points of the campaign
after three wins from three but nearly sneaked victory in the
dying minutes when Makoto Hasebe's diving header was kept out by
a fine save from Wang Dalei.


The J-League champions were the better side but failed to break
the deadlock. Yuki Abe had their best chance, hitting the
crossbar in the first half.


At the other end, Shanghai captain Jiang Kun blazed over early on
and Liu Zhiqing squandered an opportunity in the seventh minute,
heading over from six yards out after a low cross from Xie Hui
eluded Urawa goalkeeper Ryota Tsuzuki.


Urawa were reduced to 10 men for the final 15 minutes after
skipper Nobuhisa Yamada was controversially sent off by Omani
referee Mahmood Al Ghatrifi for apparent time wasting.


Indonesia's Persik Kediri play Sydney FC in the group later in
the day.


Eleven other Champions League games are being played Wednesday --
the fourth round of group games.
