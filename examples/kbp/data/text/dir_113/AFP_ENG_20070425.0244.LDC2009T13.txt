The German government has raised its economic growth forecast for
2007 to 2.3 percent, representing a sharp rise on its previous
prediction of 1.7 percent, Economy Minister Michael Glos said on
Wednesday.


He said the ministry was maintaining its 2008 forecast of 2.4
percent growth in Europe's biggest economy.


The government's improved 2007 forecast came after five of
Germany's leading economic institutes last week raised their
prediction for this year to 2.4 percent.


The ministry said it expected the growing economy to lead to a
reduction of more than one million in the number of unemployed
workers by the end of 2008, which would take the jobless total to
below 3.5 million, its lowest level for a decade.
