A hardline Islamic rebel group in Indian Kashmir ordered Internet
cafes to demolish closed-door cabins where users surf, claiming
they are being used for "licentious" purposes.


The al Badr Mujahedin group, which has claimed responsibilities
for many deadly attacks on Indian troops in the revolt-hit state,
issued no deadline and did not say what action it would take if
its order was disobeyed.


"The cabins in the Internet cafes facilitate licentious
activities. These cabins should be abolished," the group said in
a telephone statement to Current News Service, a local media
agency.


There are hundreds of Internet cafes throughout the Himalayan
state and many have cabins with doors and room for two people to
sit and surf.


Police said they had received complaints in the past that couples
were viewing pornographic sites and behaving in an "intimate
fashion" in the Internet cabins.


Last year, Kashmir's leading woman separatist group
Dukhtaran-e-Milat or Daughters of Faith raided some Internet
cafes, destroying equipment, to prevent what it said were
"immoral activities" in the outlets.


The militants, who are seeking to implement a stricter form of
Islam, have banned cinema halls and liquor shops in the region.


The 17-year insurgency against New Delhi rule has claimed more
than 42,000 lives by official count. Human rights groups put the
toll at 70,000 dead or missing.
