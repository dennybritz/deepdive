The funeral cortege bearing former Russian president Boris
Yeltsin's coffin set off for the historic Novodevichy cemetery on
Wednesday for burial.


Carried by a guard of honour, the coffin was taken out of the
golden-domed Christ the Saviour cathedral in central Moscow where
it has been lying-in-state since Tuesday.


Yeltsin, who died Monday of a heart attack, is to be buried in
the grounds of a 16th-century convent on a bend of the Moskva
river outside the city centre, a picturesque location that
contains the graves of leading Russian cultural and political
figures.


During the funeral service preceding the burial, Orthodox priests
chanted and wafted incense, as foreign dignitaries offered
condolences to the family and thousands of ordinary Russians
filed past the coffin.
