Pope Benedict XVI called Wednesday on motorists, especially the
young, to take care on the roads after the release of UN figures
showing accidents worldwide claim 1.2 million lives a year.


The pope said drivers must take the "greatest degree of care" and
invited his followers to pray for the victims of road accidents
and their families, during his weekly general audience in St
Peter's Square.


The World Health Organisation said in a report released Monday
that 1,000 people under the age of 25 are killed in traffic
accidents every day, mostly in Africa and Asia.


The report said traffic accidents were the biggest killer of
young people between the ages of 15 and 19, far higher than
HIV/AIDS.
