The Norwegian central bank on Wednesday left its key interest
rates unchanged, surprising analysts who had foreseen a rate hike
to avert economic overheating.


The bank said in a statement it had maintained its sight-deposit
rate at 4.0 percent and its day-to-day rate at 5.0 percent.


Analysts had been expecting a tightening in monetary policy in
the face of rising inflation and historically low unemployment in
the fast-growing oil- powered economy.


The bank since the start of the year has raised rates twice after
approving five rate hikes in 2006.
