The wildlife group WWF-Malaysia said Wednesday that its rare
footage of a critically-endangered Sumatran rhinoceros was of the
Bornean sub-species.


The footage, taken in a forest in Malaysia's Sabah state on
Borneo island, shows a rhino eating, peering through jungle
foliage and sniffing the automatic video camera equipment used to
shoot it.


WWF-Malaysia had said Tuesday the two-minute clip was the first
shot of the Sumatran rhino, but issued a clarification Wednesday
to say it was instead unprecedented footage of the Bornean sub-
species.


"The recently released rhino footage is the first-ever obtained
of behaviour in the wild of the Bornean sub-species of the
Sumatran or Asiatic Two-horned Rhinoceros, in Borneo," it said in
a statement.


"The Bornean sub-species is the rarest of all rhinos,
distinguished from Sumatran rhinos elsewhere by its relatively
small size, small teeth and a head that is high and narrow at the
back end."


The Sumatran rhinoceros is one of the world's most endangered
species with only small numbers left on Indonesia's Sumatra
island, Sabah and peninsular Malaysia, according to the WWF.


Scientists estimate that there are only between 25 and 50 of the
Bornean sub- species left on the island, it has said.
