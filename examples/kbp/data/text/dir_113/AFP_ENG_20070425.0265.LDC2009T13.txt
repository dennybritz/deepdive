British bookmakers wasted no time slashing the odds on aliens
being discovered after astronomers announced Wednesday that they
had discovered an Earth-like planet.


William Hill cut the odds on proving the existence of extra-
terrestrial life from 1,000-1 to 100-1.


"We felt we had to react to the news that an Earth-like planet
which could support intelligent life had been discovered -- after
all, we don't know for sure that intelligent extra-terrestrial
life has not already been discovered, but is being hushed up,"
said spokesman Graham Sharpe.


Astronomers reported they they had found a "super-Earth" more
than 20 light years away, the most intriguing world found so far
in the search for extra- terrestrial life.


For William Hill to pay out on an aliens bet, the prime minister
has to confirm officially the existence of intelligent extra-
terrestrial life within a year of the bet being placed.


"We have come a cropper before when, in the early 1960s, we
offered 1000/1 about man walking on the moon before 1970," said
Sharpe.


About five times the mass of Earth, the planet orbits a cool, dim
"red dwarf" star in the constellation of Libra, the team from the
European Southern Observatory said in a press release.


"Because of its temperature and relative proximity, this planet
will most probably be a very important target of the future space
missions dedicated to the search for extra terrestrial life,"
said Xavier Delfosse, a team member from France's Grenoble
University.
