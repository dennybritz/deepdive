Sydney Olympic sprint gold medallist Maurice Greene has pulled
out of the next week's Japan Grand Prix after failing to recover
from a dental operation, organisers said Wednesday.


It would have been the former world record holder's second
competitive appearance this year after announcing his plan to go
for the gold medal at next year's Beijing Olympics.


He is hoping to compete in the world championships here in
August.


At the Millrose Games indoor meet in February, the three-time
world champion collapsed in the 60 metres, stumbling after a
blistering start.


The 32-year-old, also a three-time Osaka winner in 2000, 2001 and
2004, ran only one race last season as a hairline fracture in his
foot at the Kansas Relays in April forced him out for the
remainder of the year.
