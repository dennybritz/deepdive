At least three Sri Lankan soldiers were killed and 30 wounded in
a fresh confrontation with Tamil Tiger rebels in the island's
embattled north on Wednesday, officials said.


The troops were killed in a clash in the district of Mannar where
the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) set off a
powerful roadside bomb and killed five bus passengers on Monday,
officials said.


There was no immediate word from the Tigers about the clash.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
violence that began in December 2005, despite a truce arranged in
2002 to end the bloody ethnic conflict.


The Tigers have waged a 35-year campaign for independence for the
Tamil minority that has claimed more than 60,000 lives on the
Sinhalese-majority island.
