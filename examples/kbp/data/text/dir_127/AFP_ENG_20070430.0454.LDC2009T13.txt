US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will be "polite but firm"
with her Iranian counterpart if they cross paths this week at a
conference on Iraq, US President George W. Bush said Monday.


Rice and Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki were both to
attend the conference on Iraq security scheduled to be held in
Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, Thursday and Friday, and Rice said she
did not rule out a meeting.


But Bush dampened any speculation on a breakthrough in ties
between the two countries, which have not had diplomatic ties in
more than a quarter century and are at odds over Tehran's nuclear
program.


He told a news conference Rice "would be polite but firm in
reminding the representative of the Iranian government that there
is a better way forward for the Iranian people."


Speaking after a summit with leaders of the European Union, Bush
said he hoped Iran would feel the pressure of US efforts to rally
world opposition to Iran's suspected nuclear weapons ambitions.


"If, in fact, there is a conversation (between Rice and Mottaki),
it will be one that says that if the Iranian government wants to
have a serious conversation with the US and others, they ought to
give up their enrichment program in a verifiable fashion," Bush
said.


"We will sit at the table with them along with our European
partners and Russia. That is what she will tell them."
