US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will be "polite but firm"
with her Iranian counterpart if they cross paths this week at a
conference on Iraq, US President George W. Bush said Monday.


Rice and Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki were both to
attend the conference on Iraq security scheduled to be held in
Sharm-el-Sheikh, Eygpt, Thursday and Friday, and Rice said she
did not rule out a meeting.


But Bush dampened any speculation on a breakthrough in ties
between the two countries, which have not had diplomatic ties in
more than a quarter century and are at odds over Tehran's nuclear
program.


He told a news conference Rice "would be polite but firm in
reminding the representative of the Iranian government that there
is a better way forward for the Iranian people."
