Japanese share prices fell 0.90 percent in morning trade Tuesday
as losses Monday on Wall Street overnight kept buyers at bay,
dealers said.


They said activity was muted with many bourses elsewhere in the
region closed for the Labour Day holiday while Japan's markets
are only open for two days this week.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
lost 157.11 points to 17,243.30 by the lunch break.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares declined 8.29
points or 0.49 percent to 1,692.71.
