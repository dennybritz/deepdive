Thousands of miners started an indefinite, nationwide strike
Monday to support demands for better wages, union leaders said,
as authorities insisted the protest was a total failure.


Some 40,000 miners from 33 trade unions downed their tools, said
Luis Castillo, the secretary general of the National Federation
of Miners, Metal and Steel Workers.


Workers also cut off roads leading to a Southern Copper Corp in
Ilo, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Lima, police said.


Labor Minister Susana Pinilla, on the other hand, insisted only
three unions took part in the strike, which she said had a "minor
impact" on production.


The workers demand pay hikes, better pension schemes, and want
80,000 workers to be given proper contracts.
