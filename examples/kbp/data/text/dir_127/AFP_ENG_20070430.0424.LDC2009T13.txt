A spokesman for Mali's President Amadou Toumani Toure on Monday
claimed the incumbent leader had won a second five-year term in
the weekend election.


"The curve is very clearly in favour of our candidate ... who is
largely ahead, according to the first results sent to us by our
representatives at the counting centres," Hassan Barry told AFP.


Said Barry: "In view of these results, he will be elected in the
first round with an overwhelming score."
