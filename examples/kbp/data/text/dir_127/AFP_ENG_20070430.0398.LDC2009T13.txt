The data recorder from a Greek cruise ship that sank after
hitting a reef earlier this month has been sent to a laboratory
in the United States for analysis, the Greek government said
Monday.


The maritime voyage recorder will be escorted to Florida by a
prosecutor and two harbour police for examination by L3 Aviation
Recorders, the world's leading manufacturer of the devices, the
ministry for the merchant navy said.


The recorder was raised more than two weeks ago from the wreck of
the Sea Diamond which sank to a depth of 140 metres (450 feet)
after hitting a charted reed near the tiny Greek island of
Santorini on April 5.


Analysis of the data could shed light on the sinking of the
Greek-flagged ship. Two French tourists, a 45-year-old man and
his 16-year-old daughter, disappeared and are presumed dead.


Almost 1,600 passengers and crew were evacuated.


The Sea Diamond's captain and five officers have been charged
with negligence, breaching international shipping safety
regulations and polluting the environment.
