The United States on Monday urged Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to
meet with Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, saying it was in
Riyadh's long-term national security interest to do so.


One day after Iraq's foreign minister said that the king had
turned down a request to meet with Maliki, White House spokesman
Tony Snow said "at this point, that is a dispute between the two
nations."


"We think it's important that nations in the region understand
the importance of an Iraqi democracy that can stand up and also
can serve as a bulwark against terrorism, which is a threat to
all nations in the region, whether they be Sunni, Shia, or
other," he added.


On Sunday, The Washington Post reported Abdullah had refused to
receive Maliki before a regional summit on Iraq security set for
next week because the Sunni leader was skeptical of Maliki's
Shiite government.


Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, however, said the
newspaper report was "not true," although he acknowledged a
requested visit had been denied.


"This time the Saudi king, his schedule was not suitable for this
timing," Zebari told CNN.


"So they did not decline it, but they said the king has an
internal tour which he does every now and again. So we couldn't
agree on the timing," he said, speaking in Baghdad.


The apparent snub comes as Saudi Arabia, long a US ally in the
Middle East, has been increasing critical of the US-backed Iraqi
government.
