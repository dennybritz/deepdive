The murder trial of Phil Spector hit a fresh snag on Monday after
a defense attorney representing the legendary music producer fell
ill, court officials said.


The trial will now resume on Wednesday after Spector's flamboyant
lawyer Bruce Cutler was forced to seek medical treatment for an
undisclosed illness, officials at Los Angeles Superior Court told
AFP.


"We have an ill attorney," the court official said. "The trial
will resume on Wednesday."


Justice officials had already decided not to sit on Tuesday
because of protests by immigration reform campaigners which are
expected to snarl traffic around the court building in downtown
Los Angeles.


The trial got underway in earnest last Wednesday after
prosecutors laid out their case against Spector in opening
statements.


Spector, 67, the reclusive musical genius who pioneered the 1960s
"Wall of Sound" recording technique, is accused of gunning down
40-year-old Lana Clarkson on February 3, 2003, hours after
meeting her at a Hollywood nightclub.


Spector denies murder, with his lawyers saying last week Clarkson
killed herself.


The long-awaited trial had been repeatedly delayed after Spector
replaced his lawyers on no fewer than three occasions.
