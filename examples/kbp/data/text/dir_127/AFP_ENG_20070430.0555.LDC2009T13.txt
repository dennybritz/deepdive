Despite difficulties finding work, the language barrier and
bitter winter weather, most immigrants to Canada have few regrets
about leaving their home countries, a study revealed Monday.


"Four years after arriving in Canada, the majority of new
immigrants (84 percent) were positive about their decision to
come here," said the study by Statistics Canada.


The results were derived from interviews with 7,700 immigrants
who came to Canada between April 2001 and March 2002.


Still, close to half (46 percent) said finding work had been the
most difficult part of moving, and learning either French or
English as a second language was named the second toughest part
of the experience.


"The downturn of the high-technology sector and the repercussions
of September 11 were two events that may have had particular
consequences for immigrants arriving in Canada in 2001-2002," the
report said.


Canada took in more than 157,000 immigrants during this period,
including refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as
well as economic immigrants who came to work or invest in
particular sectors, from China, India and the United States.


Immigrants surveyed said they had been drawn to values of
"freedom and democracy" and the "possibilities" offered to their
families.


The survey queried immigrants three separate times between
2001-2002 and 2005.
