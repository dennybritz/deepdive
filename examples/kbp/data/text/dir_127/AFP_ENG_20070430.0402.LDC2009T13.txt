A US destroyer docked in Georgia's Black Sea port of Batumi
Monday as part of American efforts to boost military ties with
this ex-Soviet republic in the strategic Caucasus region.


The USS The Sullivans will remain in Batumi until Wednesday and
conduct training exercises with the Georgian Navy.


"This is a very important event for Georgia and for the
development of our navy," the acting head of the Georgian Navy,
Colonel Koba Ghurtskaia, told AFP.


Rear Admiral Phillip Greene was among US Navy officials making
the port call.


"This is the first US admiral visit to Georgia and is meant to
show the US Navy's increased interest in NATO-Georgian
cooperation in maritime security," the US embassy in the Georgian
capital Tbilisi said in a statement.


The Sullivans is named after five brothers from Iowa who served
together on the USS Juneau in World War II.


Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has sought closer ties
with the West since coming to power in the 2003 Rose Revolution.
In March, he announced Georgia would more than double the number
of its soldiers serving with the US- led coalition in Iraq to
2,000.


Saakashvili has also had to deal with the two separatist
administrations of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are
backed by Russia.


NATO's ever-closer links with former Soviet republics such as
Georgia has been a source of increasing friction between Russia
and the West.
