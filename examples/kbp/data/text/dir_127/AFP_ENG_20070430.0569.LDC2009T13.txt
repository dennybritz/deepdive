New Zealand actress Keisha Castle-Hughes has given birth to a
baby girl.


The 17-year-old Oscar-nominated star of "Whale Rider" gave birth
on Wednesday last week and named the baby Felicity-Amore, her
manager Gail Cowan said.


The baby girl weighed 3.35 kilograms (seven pounds, six ounces)
and was "beautiful", Cowan said.


In a television interview aired a week ago, Castle-Hughes said
she wanted to hide away following a public controversy over her
young pregnancy with 19-year- old boyfriend Bradley Hull.


"I felt like it was bad for me to be happy about it," she said.


Castle-Hughes became the youngest actress to be nominated for a
best actress Academy Award in 2004 following her role in "Whale
Rider".


Last year she starred as the Virgin Mary in "The Nativity Story".
