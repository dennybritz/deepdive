Turkish trade unions and left-wing groups are planning to defy
Istanbul governor Muammer Guler's ban on May Day rallies Tuesday
to commemorate the 30th anniversary of deadly violence in the
city.


Guler said Monday no demonstrations in central Taksim square
would be tolerated because of possible clashes between
demonstrators and the police, the Anatolia news agency reported.


The rally would come amid simmering tensions between the army and
government as the nation awaits a ruling by the country's top
tribunal on the legitimacy of the presidential election, and two
days after a pro-secular mass protest in Istanbul.


On Tuesday unionists and left-wingers intend to march to the
heart of modern Istanbul, Turkey's biggest city, to mark the
death of 37 demonstrators there in 1977.


"We are evaluating intelligence that many illegal organisations
are planning to go there... and that they would take on the
police," Guler told a press conference, while appealing for
commonsense.


He also said that police forces would be stepped up and ordered
41 schools near Taksim square to be closed for the day for
security reasons.


On May 1, 1977, unidentified gunmen, suspected to be right-wing
extremists, opened fire on tens of thousands of people
celebrating Labour Day in central Istanbul. Thirty-seven people
were killed in the ensuing panic.
