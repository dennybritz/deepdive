The US Supreme Court on Monday ruled that AT&T could not
extend its patent complaint with Microsoft past US borders in a
welcomed precedent for US firms doing business abroad.


Justices endorsed US law that says US patents are not infringed
upon if the products at issue are made and sold in other
countries.


The decision said Microsoft did not owe US telecom giant AT&T
any damages for infringing on patented speech recognition
technology with software in its Windows operating systems in
machines built and sold overseas.


The decision was seen as a significant reprieve for major US
corporations selling products in markets around the world.


"Foreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the
manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in
foreign countries," the panel of justices said in the decision.


AT&T had argued to the court that US patent law can be
extended to protect US-patented software code sold overseas by a
US company or sent abroad to be used in products manufactured
overseas.


In 2001 AT&T sued Microsoft for violating its patent in using
its voice- recognition software in its Windows operating system,
which runs more than 90 percent of the world's personal
computers.


Three years later the two companies reached a partial settlement
out of court, with Microsoft paying an undisclosed amount to
AT&T for putting the software on US-made and distributed
products.
