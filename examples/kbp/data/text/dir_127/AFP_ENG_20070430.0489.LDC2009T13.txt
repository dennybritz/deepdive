Mali's incumbent leader Amadou Toumani Toure has taken the lead
in the presidential elections held at the weekend in the vast
west African nation, according to partial results released by the
government Monday.


Results from 64 of Mali's 703 districts, showed that Toure was
ahead with 61.3 percent of the votes cast compared with 29.8
percent for his main rival Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, according to
the ministry of territorial administration.


In the capital Bamako, Toure, who is seeking a second and final
five-year term as president, garnered 54.2 percent of the votes
compared with 38.8 percent for Keita.


Toure's spokesman, Hassan Barry, has already claimed that the
former coup leader won re-election, but the opposition has
countered by crying foul.


Eight candidates vied for the top job in one of Africa's largest
but most impoverished countries, which has nonetheless been
praised for having made significant democratic strides in the
past 15 years.
