A senior Hezbollah official on Monday hailed the damning Israeli
government report on the Lebanon war as confirmation of the
Jewish state's "historic defeat" in last summer's conflict.


"The Winograd report is an admission of Israel's historic defeat
in the face of the fighters of Hezbollah," Nabil Qaouk, the
group's chief for south Lebanon, told reporters.


"This report heralds a new phase in which the enemy will continue
its downward slide while the resistance will continue to grow
stronger," said the Hezbollah official.


The Winograd commission earlier accused Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert and Israel's top army brass of "serious failure" in
handling the 34-war sparked by Hezbollah's capture of two Israeli
soldiers last July 12.
