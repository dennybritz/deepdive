"Reggie" the alligator resurfaced in Los Angeles on Monday, more
than a year after the elusive reptile who became a local
celebrity was last seen, officials said.


The six-foot long alligator was spotted swimming in a lake in the
Harbor City neighborhood, 18 months after his last appearance in
October 2005.


"We have a live alligator in a public lake," said Los Angeles
city councillor Janice Hahn, adding that fencing would soon be
erected around the lake to keep people away from the water.


"I want to keep everybody safe. And then we'll have to find the
right gator wrangler."


Local authorities had enlisted the help of late Australian
crocodile hunter Steve Irwin to help snare the reptile, before he
was killed in a freak diving accident last year.


Reggie's lengthy disappearance from the public eye led officials
to believe that he had died or moved to a nearby flood control
channel.


Alligators are not native to California. Reggie was believed to
have been dumped into the lake by two men when he became too big
for a garden pond.


One of the men pleaded no contest to a violation of the state
Fish and Game Code for releasing the alligator and was sentenced
to three years probation.
