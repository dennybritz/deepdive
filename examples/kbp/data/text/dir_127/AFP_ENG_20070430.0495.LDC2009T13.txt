The Albanian parliament, dominated by the right-wing Democratic
party, appointed Monday former transport minister Lulzim Basha to
replace foreign minister Besnik Mustafaj, who resigned last week.


Basha, a 33-year-old legal expert, has also been a lawmaker in
the Albanian parliament since 2005. Prime Minister Sali Berisha
nominated him to replace Mustafaj who gave no explanation for
stepping down other than: "I'm feeling tired."


A former journalist and ambassador to France, Mustafaj from the
Democratic party had been foreign minister since September 2005.


Sokol Olldashi, 32, former interior minister, would replace Basha
at the helm of the transport ministry.
