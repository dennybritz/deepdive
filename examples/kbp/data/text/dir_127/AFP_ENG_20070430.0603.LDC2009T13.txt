Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez announced Monday his country's
decision to pull out of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, accusing them of exploiting small countries.


"I want to formalize the exit (of Venezuela) from the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)," Chavez said on
Venezolana state television, branding the lenders "mechanisms of
imperialism."
