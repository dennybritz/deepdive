More than half of the adult population of Spain and one in four
youngsters are overweight or obese, according to a ministry of
health study released Monday.


"Fifty two percent of the adult population and 27.6 percent of
children are either overweight or obese," the ministry said as it
unveiled the results of a 2006 study into the state of the
nation's health.


The results, based on the height and weight of respondants
interviewed in 31,000 households nationwide, showed that 15.5
percent of men and 15 percent of women were obese and that 44.4
percent of men and 30.3 percent of women were overweight.


A 2005 study showed 49.52 percent of all adults were either
overweight or obese.


Of children interviewed in the latest study, 9.1 percent of those
aged between two and 17 were obese and 18.5 percent were
overweight, compared with 8.5 and 18.2 percent a year earlier.


That puts Spain up with Britain as one of the worst-affected
nations in Europe.


Obesity raises the risk of heart disease, diabetes and some
cancers. Being overweight increases blood pressure and
cholesterol levels which can lead to heart disease.


Nonetheless, 68.8 percent of those surveyed judged their health
to be good or very good.
