AC Milan must control the game against Manchester United in
Wedensday's Champions League semi-final, according to coach Carlo
Ancelotti.


"We can't allow Manchester to take the game in hand, not even for
a quarter of an hour," Ancelotti warned.


To beat United, Ancelotti said, Milan will have to "repeat the
first hour of the game at Old Trafford. We must succeed in doing
that for 90 minutes".


The English Premiership leaders' strong point is attack, the
Italian added. "So we must try to stop them developing their
game."


In the first leg, Milan enjoyed a 2-1 lead at the break but a
second-half fightback handed United a precious 3-2 win against
the Italians.


Ancelotti added that Milan captain and defender Paolo Maldini,
who picked up a knee injury in the first leg, was uncertain to
play.


"If he's alright, he'll play because in this kind of match you
count not only on physical condition but also more the
personality and experience."
