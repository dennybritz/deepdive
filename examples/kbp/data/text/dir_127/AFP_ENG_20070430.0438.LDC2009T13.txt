South Korean giant Samsung Electronics announced Monday that it
intends to produce 12 million LCD screens a year at the official
launch of its 320-million- euro (437-million-dollar) plant at
Voderady, western Slovakia.


Samsung originally announced that it would launch production of
its new plant in March 2008 with peak output hitting 10 million
screens yearly. Turnover at the new plant will eventually reach
around 2.0 billion dollars, the company's vice president in
charge of projects, Ho Yong Duk, said.


"In constructing this plant, we aim to become the leading LCD
manufacturer on the regional market," Samsung Slovakia's Ho Young
Lee added  at the ceremony.


Samsung Electronics will directly employ around 1,200 with the
total jobs created, including seven subcontractors, rising to
around around 4,500.


The South Korean company already has a factory in the western
Slovakian town of Galanta which produces laser printers, DVD
players and computer screens. The company has also sited its
European research and distribution centre in the town.
