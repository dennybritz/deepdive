US President George W. Bush, seeking to overcome Russia's strong
opposition to a planned US missile shield, said Monday that the
proposed system was in Moscow's interest.


"Our intention is to say to Russia that 'the system is something
you ought to think about participating in,'" Bush said as he
welcomed European Union leaders to the White House for the annual
US-EU summit.
