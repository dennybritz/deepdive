Nigerian police said they will crack down on any unauthorized
demonstrations or marches that take place on Tuesday, Labour Day.


"Any procession that takes place without a police permit will be
dispersed forcibly, forcibly, I say. There will be tear gas and
if greater force is decided we will use it," Nigeria's police
chief Sunday Ehindero told journalists Monday.


After the release last week of the results of Nigeria's
governorship and presidential elections, widely criticised as
being fraudulent, opposition parties and civil society groups had
said they would hold protest marches on May 1.


But Ehindero vowed: "No form of procession will be allowed
outside the designated grounds where we have the Labour Day
rallies.


"I have given instructions to commissioners all over the
federation to use minimum force, or more than minimum force if
the need arises, to ensure that we don't have any rally without
police permission outside the designated rally grounds," he said.


A Labour Day rally normally takes place in the capital of each of
Nigeria's 36 states as well as in the federal capital Abuja.


By Monday, an umbrella group of civil society associations had
said that its protest would be limited to some participants in
the official Labour Day parade wearing black arm bands as a sign
of mourning "for the death of democracy".
