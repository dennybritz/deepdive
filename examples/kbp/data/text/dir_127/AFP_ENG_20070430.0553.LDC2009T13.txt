A police officer who deliberately rammed a car he was chasing,
leaving the 19 -year-old driver disabled, acted lawfully to
protect others from harm, the US Supreme Court ruled on Monday.


The court's judges ruled by eight votes to one in favor of
Officer Timothy Scott, who rammed the car driven by Victor
Harris, sending it out of control and off the road at 140
kilometers (87 miles) an hour in the state of Georgia in March
2001.


Harris had fled after police tried to stop him for speeding. He
was paralyzed in the crash.


"A police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed
car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does
not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing
motorist at risk of serious injury or death," one of the
justices, Antonin Scalia, wrote in his judgement.


The Fourth Amendment to the US constitution protects citizens
from "unreasonable searches and seizures." A lower court earlier
ruled that Scott violated the amendment by using excessive force
to stop Harris.
