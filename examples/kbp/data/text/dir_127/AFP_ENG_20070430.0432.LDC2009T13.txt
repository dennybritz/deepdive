Egyptian police on Monday released two MPs of the Muslim
Brotherhood who were arrested the previous day along with 12
others members of the banned opposition movement, judicial
sources said.


Sabri Amer and Ragab Abu Zeid were freed after having been
questioned as witnesses, the sources said, while the others were
still being investigated.


The group were apprehended in the house of one of the members, in
the Menufiya region north of Cairo. Police found documents at the
address that allegedly sought to justify the existence of the
Muslim Brotherhood.


The Brotherhood called the arrests evidence of government
"repression" against its organisation, according to a website run
by the group.


A fifth of Egypt's parliament is effectively controlled by the
Muslim Brotherhood, which is supported by MPs officially
declaring themselves "independents".


But the security services have been conducting a crackdown in
recent months, stepping up arrests of suspected members.
