Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the nation he refuses to resign
in an address on Israeli radio and television despite a report
that blasted his handling of last year's Lebanon war.


"It would not be timely for me to resign and I do not intend to
do so," said the embattled premier.


But Olmert acknowledged that "many mistakes were made by those
who took the decisions, with me at the head. These mistakes must
be rectified."


An Israeli government commission earlier accused Olmert of
"serious failure in exercising judgement, responsibility and
prudence" during last year's war against Lebanon's Hezbollah.
