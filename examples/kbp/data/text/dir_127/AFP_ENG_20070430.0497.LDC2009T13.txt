Italy national coach Roberto Donadoni said on Monday that there
were too many foreigners playing in Serie A.


The former AC Milan and Italy star - who replaced Marcello Lippi
at the helm of the world champions after they won the World Cup
last year - had already started the debate last week when he
congratulated Inter Milan on winning the domestic title but
regretted that there had been just one Italian player who started
the match.


"Maybe I am going to make some enemies but honestly in Italy
there are too many foreign players," said Donadoni.


"When I was playing, there were three per team, and maybe that
wasn't enough.


"But there shouldn't be more than five per team as there is now,"
added the 43 -year-old, who has struggled to win over the fans
since replacing Lippi though three successive wins in their Euro
2008 qualifiers has reduced the gap between them and group
leaders Scotland to two.


Hopwever, despite Donadoni's comments AC Milan, Italy's sole
survivors in the Champions League, are likely to field at least
six and probably seven - should Paolo Maldini recover from a knee
injury - in their second leg semi-final clash with Manchester
United on Wednesday.


United lead the tie 3-2.
