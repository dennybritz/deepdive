France this year had its hottest April since 1950, with the
average temperature four degrees Celsius higher than the usual 10
degrees (50 Fahrenheit), the national weather office said Monday.


In the northern half of France, averages recorded between the
first and the 24 of April were between 8 and 12 degrees higher
than the seasonal norm, said Meteo France.


1950 was the year reliable temperature measurements from 22
stations across France were begun.


Record April temperatures across Europe have led to fears of
drought.


Amid growing fears over global warming, experts say average
temperatures have already risen 0.74 degrees Celsius over the
past century and predict that they will rise another four degrees
Celsius by the end of this century.
