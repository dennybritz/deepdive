Prince Harry will deploy to Iraq, the head of the British army
said Monday, after speculation that he may be withdrawn from
service because of fears he could be targeted by insurgents.


"I have taken the decision as chief of general staff. It's my
decision as chief of general staff. I have full command of
everyone in the army, including Prince Harry," said General Sir
Richard Dannatt in a statement.


"The decision has been taken by myself that he (Harry) will
deploy with his regiment in due course."


Dannatt said the decision had been taken after the "widest
possible consultation", adding: "Should circumstances change... I
will make a further statement."
