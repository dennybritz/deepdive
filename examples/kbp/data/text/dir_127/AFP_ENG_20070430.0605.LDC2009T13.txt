Otago Highlanders forward Filipo Levi has signed a two-year
contract to play for Japanese club Ricoh.


Levi, 27, is the third player from the Highlanders Super 14 rugby
side to confirm a move overseas following All Black prop Carl
Hayman, who will join Newcastle in England and flanker Josh
Blackie, who is moving to Japanese club Kobe Steel.


Levi, who also played for Otago in the domestic provincial
championship, will leave after the Highlanders' final match of
the season Saturday against the ACT Brumbies.


"I was given an opportunity that was too good to turn down,"
Filipo said Tuesday.


Levi has played 70 games for Otago since 2000 and 66 for the
Highlanders since 2002, mostly at lock.


He has played Test rugby for the Pacific Islands and will be
available to play for Samoa in this year's World Cup.


Veteran Highlanders hooker Anton Oliver is in his final season
for the Highlanders and is expected to move overseas, while
halfback Jimmy Cowan and prop Clarke Dermody are also tipped to
take up overseas contracts.
