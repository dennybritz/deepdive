The flip of a switch could become all it takes to get a good
night's sleep, according to a study released Monday.


Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have found a
way to stimulate the slow waves typical of deep sleep by sending
a harmless magnetic signal through the skulls of sleeping
volunteers.


They say it could one day be used to help treat insomnia and for
power naps where people would get the benefit of a full night's
of sleep in just a few hours.


The experimental technique called transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) uses magnetic fields to alter brain activity.


It's non-invasive and typically involves an electromagnetic coil
that is held near the head. An electric current creates a
magnetic impulse or field that travels through the skull
triggering small electrical currents in the brain.


In this experiment, the investigators found that with each burst
of magnetism, the brains of the sleeping volunteers immediately
produced the big slow waves seen in stage three and four sleep.


"With a single pulse, we were able to induce a wave that looks
identical to the waves that the brain makes normally during
sleep," said Giulio Tononi, professor of psychiatry at the UW-
Madison School of Medicine and Public Health.


It remains to be seen whether this kind of electronically-
assisted deep sleep does indeed confer benefits and whether it
could enhance a person's performance and memory, Tononi said.
Further studies are planned to that end.


The study was published in the April 30 edition of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
