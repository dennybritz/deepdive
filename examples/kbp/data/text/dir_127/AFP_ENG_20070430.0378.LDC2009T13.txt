The Council of Europe called on Monday on the Palestinian
Authority to do everything it can to ensure the release of
kidnapped BBC reporter Alan Johnston.


"The Palestinian Authority should do all in its power to liberate
Alan Johnston and guarantee safe working conditions for all
journalists in the territory under its jurisdiction," Secretary
General Terry Davis said in a statement.


"Those who abducted him are not only violating his human rights
but also acting against the interests of the Palestinian people,"
he said.


"If journalists are forced to leave, lies and propaganda will
triumph over the truth and the region will sink even deeper into
the quagmire of extremist violence."


Johnston, 44, the only foreign journalist to have been based in
the troubled Gaza Strip on a permanent basis over the past three
years, was kidnapped in Gaza City on March 12 and there is still
no clear indication of his fate.
