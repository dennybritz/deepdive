The US Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a case brought by
two detainees at the US prison in Guantanamo Bay, who were
contesting the legality of the base's military courts.


The court did not give any reason for refusing to hear the case,
but said three of the nine judges had been in favor of proceeding
with the hearing.


Yemeni national Salim Ahmed Hamdan and Canadian Omar Khadr, who
are about to face military trial at Guantanamo, had urged the
Supreme Court earlier in April to rule on their legal rights
before proceedings begin.


The two men said they did not have time to pursue other legal
avenues to see if they were protected under the US constitution
because their day in military court is fast approaching.


Both men are among the first Guantanamo prisoners the US
government intends to prosecute this summer in special military
courts, known as military commissions.


"The time to hear this particular case is now," the petitioners
had said in their brief.


"Petitioners are irreparably harmed by having to defend
themselves in trials where they are kept ignorant as to whether
or not the constitution protects them and governs the procedures
by which their prosecutions are allowed to proceed."


Earlier in April, the US high court ruled that dozens of
Guantanamo Bay inmates had no right to challenge their detention
in federal court and that they had not exhausted all other legal
options.
