More than a thousand people flocked to clothing store Topshop's
flagship Oxford Street branch in London on Monday for the launch
of the Kate Moss collection.


Supermodel Moss drank champagne inside the multi-storey fashion
store with select invited guests and the boss of Topshop's parent
company, Philip Green, and briefly posed alongside mannequins
that were displaying a red dress that she had designed.


"It is exciting," Green said.


"It wouldn't be here if we didn't believe in it. This is about
building a business. This is about whether we can build something
that is real."


Shoppers had been queuing outside the central London store for up
to eight hours for the sale, which began at 8 pm (1900 GMT), and
ended at midnight. The collection goes on sale nationwide on
Tuesday.


They were all given individual wrist bands that allotted them
20-minute time slots giving them access to the Moss collection,
in batches of 150 at a time. They were each allowed to buy only
five items.


The collection included a 45-pound (66-euro, 90-dollar) floral
print dress, as well as skinny jeans, one-shoulder mini-dresses
and t-shirts ranging from 12 pounds to 150 pounds.


"I think it has exceeded the hype," said 24-year-old fashion blog
editor Kim Foster.


"We didn't really think anyone was really coming down this
afternoon. I'll see what happens quality wise because a lot of
them (the clothes) are quite highly priced."
