At least one man was killed and 25 others were injured late
Monday when a bomb exploded at a night market in Thailand's
restive Muslim-majority south, officials said.


The bomb was hidden in a motorcycle, parked in front of a shop in
Pattani, one of three insurgency-torn southern provinces
bordering Malaysia, Pattani Governor Thanu Uthairat said.


"The explosion happened around 8:25 pm (1325 GMT) and most of the
injured were shoppers," the governor said.  A Pattani hospital
official said at least one man was killed and 25 others wounded.


The market bombing capped a day of violence in Pattani, where
police found the headless and burned body of a 30-year-old
Buddhist man, along with the charred body of his 14-year-old
nephew, on a road earlier in the day.


The man's head was discovered a few kilometres (miles) away.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in three years of unrest
in the three southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani.


The military-backed government, which came to power after a
September coup, has made peace-building efforts in a bid to rein
in the insurgency, but violence has escalated over the past six
months.
