Scottish Cup finalists Dunfermline Athletic secured what could
prove to be a crucial three points against their fellow
relegation candidates St Mirren on Monday with a 1-0 victory in
their Scottish Premiership clash.


Tam McManus was the goalscoring hero for the 'Pars - scoring in
the 58th minute - to bring his side to within a point of St
Mirren with three matches remaining.


Dunfermline play champions Celtic in the Scottish Cup final.
