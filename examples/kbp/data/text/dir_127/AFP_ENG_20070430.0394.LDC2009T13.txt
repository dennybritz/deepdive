The Swiss capital, Bern, could host Europe's largest Islamic
cultural and economic centre if a project by local Muslim
associations is approved, organisers said Monday.


The 23,000 square metre (27,700 square yard) "platform for Islam"
would include a congress centre, a four-star hotel, a museum,
offices and a mosque, said Farhad Afshar, a Bern university
professor and spokesman for Islamic organisations involved in the
project.


"We want to show the wealth of Islamic culture in Switzerland by
presenting its many facets,' Afshar explained.


"The offices could house trading companies that deal with Islamic
nations," he added.


Marco Ryter, a Swiss architect dealing with the feasibility
study, estimated that the centre would cost between 60 and 80
million Swiss francs (36.4 and 48.6 million euros, 50 and 66
million dollars).


The centre could be financed by pension funds or private
investors and a foundation set up in Switzerland, Afshar said.


The land earmaked for the centre is part of a 34-hectare
(84-acre) area on the northern outskirts of Bern which is being
redeveloped and city authorities are studying a variety of
building projects.


There are about 311,000 Muslims among the 7.5 million strong
Swiss population, according to official statistics. Most of them
are originally from the Balkans.
