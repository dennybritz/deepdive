The Liberian Senate has ratified an iron ore mining contract
sealed last year between the government and the world's largest
steelmaker, Arcelor Mittal.


Senate spokesman Varney Gbaysay told AFP Monday that a majority
of the members last Friday approved the deal which had been
passed the previous week by the lower house.


"There were 20 senators in the special session and the majority
approved the agreement," he said.


Under the so-called Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) signed by
the Liberian government and Mittal in December, the steelmaker
has promised to pour more than a billion dollars (730 million
euros) in investment into the war-ravaged state.


The agreement is a revised version of an August 2005 deal,
reached by a transitional government, but rejected as unfair by
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf when she came into
office five months later.


The 25-year concession deal -- which will generate more than
20,000 jobs once the mining operation is fully operational --
gives Mittal access to a billion cubic metres of iron ore in the
resource-rich west African country.


Mittal will operate in three of Liberia's 15 counties of Nimba in
the north, Bong in the centre and eastern Grand-Bassa which sit
on huge deposits of the ore.


It will have to make available three million dollars for the
three counties for general development as part of the deal.


"The money will go directly to the local authorities," Gbaysay
said.
