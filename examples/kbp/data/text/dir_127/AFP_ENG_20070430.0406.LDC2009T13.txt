Tens of thousands sporting the national colour orange thronged
Amsterdam Monday to celebrate Queen's Day, a traditional festival
to fete the Dutch monarch.


The national railway service said about 146,000 people had taken
trains to Amsterdam by noon, surpassing the figure for the
previous year.


Many revellers wore orange clothes or wigs or sported orange-
tinted hair. The city's streets were meanwhile full of kiosks
selling a wide array of goods.


Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands chose to mark Queen's Day on the
birthday of her mother, the queen Juliana, instead of her own as
a tribute to the deceased and greatly loved monarch.


A giant rock concert will cap the festivities on Monday evening.
It will be held near the city's famed Rijksmuseum.
