A British soldier who had admitted abusing Iraqi civilians was
thrown out of the army and jailed for a year on Monday after
being convicted as the country's first war criminal.


Corporal Donald Payne, 36, had admitted to inhumane conduct
against Iraqi civilians -- one of whom subsequently died -- in
the southern city of Basra in 2003.


The sentence, handed down by a military court in Wiltshire,
southwest England, will also cost him some 300,000 pounds
(439,000 euros, 600,000 dollars) in loss of future earnings and
pension rights.


Payne was cleared in February of manslaughter and perverting the
course of justice, but pleaded guilty to inhumane conduct,
leading to him becoming Britain's first ever convicted war
criminal.


Four co-defendants were cleared at that time, while two officers
were cleared for failing to ensure troops under their command did
not abuse a group of Iraqi civilian detainees.


The detainees were arrested by the Queen's Lancashire Regiment at
a hotel in Basra, southern Iraq, in September 2003, six months
after the US-led invasion.


Baha Musa, a 26-year-old hotel worker, suffocated when he was
forced to the floor with his arms behind his back as the soldiers
tried to cuff him, prosecutors charged last September.


They alleged that the detainees were beaten, hooded, deprived of
sleep and made to hold stressful positions over a 36-hour period.
