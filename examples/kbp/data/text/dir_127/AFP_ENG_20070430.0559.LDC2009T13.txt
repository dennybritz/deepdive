Six people died and several were injured late Monday in a
stampede at an open air concert held in Sfax, 300 kilometres (200
miles) south of Tunis, the official news agency Tunis Afrique
Presse (TAP) reported.


The stampede occurred shortly after 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) at a
theatre in the suburbs of the port city where a concert was being
held for the TV programme "Star Academy", the agency said.


A major surge of enthusiastic spectators started when stars from
Tunisia and other Arab countries appeared on stage. One of the
female singers, from Sfax, had many fans in the audience,
witnesses told AFP by telephone.


Several spectators fell down during the stampede and were
trampled, a witness said.


Rescuers arrived quickly to give first aid to the injured and
take them to local hospitals.


TAP did not say how many were injured, or how badly.


President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali told the ministers of the
interior and health, Rafik Belhaj Kacem and Ridha Kechride, to go
immediately to Sfax and transmit his condolences to the families
of the dead, the agency said.


A judicial inquiry was opened into the accident.
