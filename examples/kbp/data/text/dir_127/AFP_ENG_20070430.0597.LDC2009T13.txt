A 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck Monday in the Solomon Sea near
the Papua New Guinean island of Bougainville, the US Geological
Survey said.


The quake was centred 113 kilometres (70 miles) southwest of the
town of Arawa in Bougainville and 175 kilometres from Chirovanga
in the Solomon Islands.


There were no early reports of any damage from the quake, which
occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres at 11:15 am (0015 GMT).


There have been a large number of quakes and aftershocks since
April 2, when a 8.0-magnitude quake nearby in the western Solomon
Islands unleashed a tsunami with waves up to several metres high.


At least 52 people were killed and thousands left homeless.
