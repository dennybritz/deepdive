In their quest to start a family, Canadian couples are illegally
buying human eggs online, according to an investigation by public
broadcaster CBC.


Canada outlawed the purchase of eggs in 2004, as part of an act
to prevent human cloning. Anyone convicted of buying eggs faces a
fine of up to 500,000 Canadian dollars (450,000 US dollars) or 10
years in jail.


But it is not illegal for women to sell eggs.


Six Canadian women who advertised their eggs on the Internet told
CBC they were willing to undergo treatment that could fetch up to
20 eggs, for a fee of up to 7,000 Canadian dollars (6,300 US
dollars).


And they admitted to lying to doctors about receiving payments to
undergo such procedures.


Despite the stiff penalty, the unidentified egg donors said they
felt compelled to help childless couples and claimed the fees
they charge are simply "fair compensation" for the toll fertility
treatments take on their bodies.
