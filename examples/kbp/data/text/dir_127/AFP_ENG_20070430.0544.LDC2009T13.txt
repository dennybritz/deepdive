Teammates Tim Duncan and Bruce Bowen headlined the National
Basketball Association's All-Defensive Team announced on Monday
and were joined by Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Camby.


It was the 10th consecutive selection for Duncan, the most among
active players. He has been a First Team choice seven times.


Bowen earned his seventh straight selection, the last four as a
First Team member. He was a Second Team choice in 2000 with Miami
before signing with San Antonio as a free agent.


In balloting of NBA coaches who were not allowed to select
players from their team, Bowen received 19 first-team votes and
42 points. Duncan received 16 first-team votes and 36 points.


Together, Duncan and Bowen helped the Spurs hold opponents to a
league-best 90.1 points per game and a .433 field-goal
percentage, which ranked third in the league.


San Antonio has finished in the top five in both categories in
each of Duncan's 10 seasons.


Camby, the center of the Denver Nuggets, received 11 first-team
votes and 34 points as he supplanted Chicago's Ben Wallace, the
First Team center for the last five years. It was the third
selection and initial First Team honour for Camby, who led the
NBA in blocks per game.


The First Team guards were Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers
and Raja Bell of the Phoenix Suns. Bryant received 14 first-team
votes and 32 points while Bell garnered seven and 25.
