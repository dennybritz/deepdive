A landmine killed an unknown number of Ethiopian troops as they
were travelling in a truck on a road between the Somali capital
Mogadishu and the southcentral town of Baidoa, local police said.


"There was a heavy explosion and when we went to the scene to
help them, we found blood and debris," said Mohamed Hassan Ahmed,
police chief for Wanlaweyne district, around 90 kilometres (55
miles) west of the capital.


"The (Ethiopian) forces told us they suffered deaths and
casualties, but they refused to give us the exact details," he
told AFP.


Meanwhile, at least four people were killed and one was wounded
when gunmen opened fire on a local administrator making a prison
visit in the Somali town of Afgoye, government officials said.


"I had gone to the prison to check the situation there when some
gunmen attacked me," Hassan Ahmed Hassanhe, the district
commissioner for the town of Afgoye, around 20 kilometres (12
miles) southwest of the capital Mogadishu, told AFP.


"They killed one of my bodyguards on the spot, and wounded three
others. Two of the wounded bodyguards later died and another
woman was killed by stray bullets," he added.


Hassan said he had imposed a curfew on the town, a temporary home
to some 41,000 civilians displaced from Mogadishu by recent
fighting between government-backed Ethiopian forces and Islamist
insurgents.
