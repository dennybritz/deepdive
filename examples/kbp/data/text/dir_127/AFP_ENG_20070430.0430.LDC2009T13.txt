Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told ministers from his Kadima
party on Monday he will not resign despite a report that blasted
his handling of last year's Lebanon war, media reported.


"This is a very hard report that exposes the failures, notably of
the political leadership of this country with me at the head, but
I don't think that it would be timely that I resign," Channel 2
quoted Olmert as saying.


"We are going to immediately apply the recommendations of the
commission," Olmert was quoted as saying.
