French energy group Total has been slapped with a 2.9-million-
dollar penalty by the US government for releasing "harmful
emissions" from a Texas refinery, officials said Monday.


Aside from the penalty, Total has also agreed to spend 37 million
dollars to upgrade its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to clean up
the plant's emissions.


"We are committed to enforcing the laws that protect the
environment and public health, in an effort to continue bringing
the refinery industry into compliance," said Matthew McKeown,
acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's
environment and natural resources division.


The settlement with Total's US unit was overseen by the Justice
Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.


The government said Total's new measures would significantly cut
emissions generated by flaring, during which byproduct-gas from
the refining process is burned-off in a flaring device.
