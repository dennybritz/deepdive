US daily newspaper circulation is down 2.1 percent from a year
ago even as more readers turn to websites run by the newspapers
themselves, an industry survey showed Monday.


The Newspaper Association of America said circulation for 745
dailies fell to 44.96 million in the six-month period to March
31, a drop of 2.1 percent from the same period a year ago.


Sunday newspaper circulation fell 3.1 percent to 48.1 million for
the 601 papers.


Fewer than half of all US adults currently read a daily newspaper
at least once a month, a far cry from the 80.8 percent in 1964.


But the NAA also said recently released data from
Nielsen/NetRatings showed that showed more than 59 million people
visited a newspaper website on average during the first quarter
of 2007, up 5.3 percent from a year ago.


And the data showed stronger gains among the younger demographic
segment that newspapers have been struggling to reach: the rise
in newspaper website visits was 13.7 percent for the 25- to 34
-year-old group a 9.2 percent for 18- to 24 -year-olds.


"While newspaper marketing practices continue to focus strongly
on sustaining the core readership, newspapers are working hard to
leverage the brand power of the core product to attract readers
to their print and online publications that serve advertisers,"
said NAA president John Sturm.


"To quote the industry trade campaign, newspapers are the 'multi-
medium,' and the total audience for newspaper media speaks
volumes more about our future than a simple focus on core
circulation."
