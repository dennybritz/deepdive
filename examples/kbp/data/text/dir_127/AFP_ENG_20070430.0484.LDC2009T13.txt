Two French youths Monday were each sentenced to five years in
prison, three of them suspended, for pushing a homosexual man
into a canal and causing his death.


The judge, handing down the ruling, said the two men now aged 20
had been "impregnated with latent homophobia."


The pair attacked their victim at a cruising spot in the
northeastern town of Nancy in 2003 and threw him into a canal.
The victim drowned as he did not known how to swim and the two
youths did not heed his cries for help.
