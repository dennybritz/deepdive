The US government is seeking to bar former CIA agent Luis Posada
Carriles, who is wanted in Venezuela and Cuba for the downing of
an airliner, from talking about his links with the agency when he
goes on trial in May.


In a nine-page motion filed with a federal tribunal in El Paso,
Texas, state prosecutors claimed Posada Carriles's relationship
with the Central Intelligence Agency ended more than 30 years ago
and that as testimony or questioning about those ties were not
relevant to his trial on immigration charges.


A fierce opponent of Cuba's communist President Fidel Castro,
Posada Carriles was convicted in Venezuela in 1976 of
masterminding the downing of the Cuban jet off Barbados, but
escaped from prison in 1985.


He was sentenced to eight years' jail in Panama in a 2000 bomb
plot to assassinate Castro, and was pardoned four years later.


Posada Carriles was detained by US immigration officials in May
2005 for entering the United States illegally.


He was released on a 350,000-dollar bond on April 19, pending the
May 11 start of his trial.


Declassified US documents show that Posada Carriles worked for
the CIA from 1965 to June 1976. He reportedly helped the US
government ferry supplies to the Contra rebels who waged a bloody
campaign to topple the socialist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua in the 1980s.
