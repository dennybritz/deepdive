US President George W. Bush said Monday that embattled World Bank
President Paul Wolfowitz "ought to stay" in his post and urged
restive bank directors to give him a fair hearing.


"He ought to stay, and he ought be given a fair hearing," Bush
said as he welcomed European Union leaders to the White House for
the annual US-EU summit.
