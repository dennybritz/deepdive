The Palestinian government of prime minister Ismail Haniya has
established contact with the kidnappers of a BBC journalist in
the Gaza Strip, a senior official said on Monday.


It was the first time that a Palestinian official confirmed
contact with those holding Alan Johnston, snatched at gunpoint
seven weeks ago as he drove home from work in Gaza City on March
12.


"An envoy of Ismail Haniya met representatives of Johnston's
kidnappers today and conveyed a firm message in the name of the
government that they have to free him immediately," the official
told AFP on condition of anonymity.


Haniya heads the Palestinian unity government and belongs to the
Islamist movement Hamas -- branded by the West as a terrorist
organisation.
