Spain on Monday welcomed a UN resolution calling on Morocco and
the independence movement in Western Sahara, a former  Spanish
colony, to hold direct autonomy talks aimed at ending a 32-year
spat.


"The Spanish government values satisfactorily and with cautious
hope the possibility that a structured dialogue could be opened
between the parts," the foreign ministry said in a statement.


The ministry said it hoped the talks would lead to "a politically
just, lasting and mutually acceptable solution that includes the
self-determination to the people of the Western Sahara."


Earlier the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution
urging Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front to launch
UN-sponsored talks without preconditions on self-determination to
end a 32-year-old dispute.


Morocco annexed the northwest African territory, which has large
phosphate reserves and rich fishing grounds, after the withdrawal
of the region's former colonial power Spain and neighbor
Mauritania in the 1970s, settling it with around 300,000
Moroccans in 1975.


A war ensued with the Algerian-backed Polisario Front, an armed
group which contested Rabat's sovereignty, that ended in 1991
with a UN-brokered ceasefire.
