At least two people were killed and many more injured Thursday
when Mozambique's largest arms depot exploded near Maputo
International Airport, local television reported.


"It's the biggest armoury in the country. It contains thousands
of tonnes of weapons and ammunition," said Miguel Barreiro, a
United Nations official in charge of the country's disarmament
program.


Bombs, mines and rounds of ammunition exploded in the late
afternoon in the southeast African country, reported the private-
owned TVM station.


The blast which could be heard around the city also caused a
large amount of damage to nearby buildings, shattering the glass
and windows in many offices.


Television reports did not give further figures on how many peope
were injured, but Maputo's central hospital had issued an urgent
appeal for people to come to the hospital and donate blood.


President Armando Guebuza, speaking on state radio, appealed for
calm among the citizens of Maputo following the explosion.


Mozambique was locked in a vicious civil war between 1975 and
1992 but has been largely peaceful since then.
