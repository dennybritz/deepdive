Russian envoy to the UN Vitaly Churkin on Thursday expressed
shock over a mortar attack in Baghdad as visiting Ban Ki-moon was
holding a press conference and said his delegation was drafting a
statement in support of the UN chief.


An explosion rocked Baghdad's fortified Green Zone on Thursday as
Ban held a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-
Maliki, causing the UN secretary general to flinch.


"Obviously we are concerned and shocked that there has been this
development," Churkin told reporters. "That's a reminder to all
of us of the serious and difficult security situation in that
country. We support the role of the United Nations in Iraq."


He said his delegation was drafting a statement "in support of
the secretary general's mission in Iraq" which he hoped the full
Security Council would approve later in the day.


Ban told the joint press conference with Maliki that he was
"confident that we'll be able to see in the near future, a more
prosperous and secure and politically and democratically
healthier future of the Iraqi people and government."


But just moments after Ban said the United Nations may bolster
its presence in Iraq, a mortar round landed in a garden 40 meters
(yards) away.


After a brief pause, during which Ban recovered his composure
after an involuntary flinch, the interpreter continued to
translate Ban's remarks into Arabic and both men took more
questions.
