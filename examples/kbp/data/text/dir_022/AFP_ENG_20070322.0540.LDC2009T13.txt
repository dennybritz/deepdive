A plane traveling from Cape Verde to Amsterdam in the Netherlands
made an unscheduled stop in the Lisbon on Thursday after a
Nigerian passenger fell ill and died in mid-air, police said.


The TACV-Cabo Verde Airlines plane requested permission to land

passenger reported feeling sick, they said. The passenger died
before the plane was able to land.


The body was removed from the plane after it landed and was taken
