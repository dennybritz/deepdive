The German parliament on Thursday adopted a draft law which would
increase the surveillance of repeat sex offenders after a known
paedophile was convicted of repeatedly raping a teenage girl.


The bill, which must be approved by the upper house of parliament
before passing into law, would see sexual offenders placed under
closer observation in the years immediately following their
release from prison.


A visit to a doctor or a therapist could be made a condition of
their release and refusal to attend the appointments could lead
to a prison sentence of up to three years.


Under the new law, sex offenders could receive therapy for life
instead of the current limit of five years.


Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries said she wanted "the best
possible protection" for the children and wives of sex offenders,
who are at particular risk.


The law was prompted by the case of Mario Mederake, a 36-year-old
labourer previously convicted of sexually abusing a child, who
raped a 13-year-old girl more than 100 times after seizing her as
she walked to school in the eastern city of Dresden in January
2006.


Mederake would shut the girl in a wooden box when he left the
apartment and often filmed himself sexually abusing her.


He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in December last year.


The court in Dresden heard that the girl was only freed by police
when she managed to drop a scrap of paper in the street which
carried a desperate plea for help and the address where she was
being imprisoned scrawled in red pen.
