President Pervez Musharraf Thursday appointed a Hindu judge as
Pakistan's new acting chief justice, as the government stepped up
efforts to defuse a crisis over the suspension of the country's
top judge.


A government notification said Justice Rana Bhagwandas, the
senior-most judge who has been on leave, would "act as chief
justice of Pakistan with effect from the date he resumes his
office."


Bhagwandas, the only Hindu judge at the country's Supreme Court,
is in the southern port city of Karachi where he arrived
Wednesday from a private visit to India. His leave expires on
Friday.


He would replace Justice Javed Iqbal, who was appointed acting
chief justice on March 9 when the president suspended chief
justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry on charges including that the
judge strong-armed promotions for his own son.


Lawyers have held nationwide demonstrations and strikes in
protest.


Musharraf referred the case to a Supreme Judicial Council.


After taking oath as acting chief justice, Bhagwandas is expected
to head a reconstituted judicial council for further hearing of
the case against Chadhury.


The council held two sessions last week and a scheduled third
sitting was postponed, amid demonstrations by the law community
demanding reinstatement of Justice Chaudhry.
