Pop superstar Madonna would throw her support behind Al Gore if
he decided to run for US president in 2008, she has told German
weekly newspaper Die Zeit.


Madonna said she had "deep respect for Hillary Clinton as a
woman," but thought Gore was a "great guy."


"I would publicly support him if he joins the race," Madonna
said, adding she had been impressed by his stance on
environmental issues.


Gore won an Oscar this year for his climate change documentary
"An Inconvenient Truth."


Gore, who was vice president to Bill Clinton, lost to George W.
Bush in the 2000 election.


The lifelong Democrat has not ruled out taking another crack at
running for the White House.
