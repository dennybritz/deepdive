A group of 15 former employees of the Eiffel Tower went on trial
on Thursday in Paris, accused of embezzling one million euros
from sales of tickets to visit Paris's most famous landmark.


The 12 women and three men aged 35 to 63 are accused of taking
advantage of weaknesses in the ticket office's computer system to
steal part of the sales revenues from 1996 to 2002.


They individually face charges of embezzling amounts varying
between 8,981 euros (12,000 dollars) to 125,796 euros.


The defendants denied any wrongdoing during the appearance before
a Paris criminal court on Thursday.


The company that manages the Eiffel Tower uncovered the scam in
February 2002 after receiving an anonymous letter from an
employee.


"I have worked for your company for a season and I have noticed
certain fraudulent transactions," said the letter.


An investigation led to charges against 15 of the 27 employees
working at the ticket office.


Visitors to the Eiffel Tower pay up to 11.50 euros to ride one of
the elevators to the top of the tower.


The trial is expected to continue until March 30.
