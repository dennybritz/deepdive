Britain has begun preparations to work with a new government in
Zimbabwe once President Robert Mugabe leaves office including
humanitarian aid, a Foreign Office spokeswoman told AFP Thursday.


"We're beginning to think about what we could contribute
following a transition and we're preparing support options
including economic and humanitarian activity," she said.


The spokeswoman declined to give further details.


Unnamed senior officials at the Foreign Office, meanwhile,
believe that 2007 may be a "pivotal" year for Zimbabwe, Britain's
Press Association news agency reported Thursday.


The former colonial power is looking to the future as
international pressure on Mugabe builds following increased
violence against the opposition and an economy heading for
collapse.


Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday that he wanted the
European Union to widen political sanctions against the regime,
which were brought in in 2002.


And Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett has called for action from
the United Nations Security Council and the UN Human Rights
Commission.


The leader of the lower House of Commons Jack Straw said Thursday
that a Foreign Office minister would make a statement on the
situation in Zimbabwe to parliament on Monday.


Blair on Wednesday called recent events "appalling, disgraceful
and utterly tragic for the people of Zimbabwe."


Mugabe's ZANU-PF says that the existing sanctions hurt ordinary
people and has accused countries, including Britain and the
United States, of a personal vendetta against the 83-year-old
president.
