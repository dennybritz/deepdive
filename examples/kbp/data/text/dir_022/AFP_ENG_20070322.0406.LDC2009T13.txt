A Jordanian woman said on Thursday that she had received interior
ministry approval to set up the kingdom's first political party
headed by a woman.


Mona Hussein showed AFP a statement signed on March 14 by
Interior Minister Eid Fayez allowing her to set up the centrist
National Jordanian Party.


"I am very happy to have received the approval to set up the
party," the former chemistry professor said.


"There is nothing in Jordan to prohibit a woman from heading a
political party. All of us, women and men, can serve the
country,".


Earlier this month, a draft law setting a higher threshold for
the registration of political parties received approval from both
houses of parliament.


But it is not expected to receive royal assent until later in the
year, meaning that Hussein needed the support of just 50 founding
members not the minimum of 500 set by the new legislation.


King Abdullah II had called on MPs to fast-track the reform bill
in a bid to streamline the kingdom's political parties which
currently number around 30.
