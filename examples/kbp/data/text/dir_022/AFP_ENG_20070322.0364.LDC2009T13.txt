A key measure of future US economic activity turned sharply lower
in February, reflecting turmoil in the housing and manufacturing
sectors, the Conference Board said Thursday.


The business research group's index of leading economic
indicators fell 0.5 percent following a revised 0.3 percent
decline in January.


Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said the overall
economic outlook remains positive despite the weak figure. The
index is meant to gauge economic activity in the coming six to
nine months.


"The housing and manufacturing sectors are clearly going through
a correction, but the consumer sector appears to be holding up,"
he said.


"That mix should generate modest but choppy growth ahead.
Overall, the consumer has shown remarkable resiliency in the face
of wide swings in energy prices, a slowing in home prices and a
sharp cooling off in home building."


The index was below the average Wall Street forecast of a 0.3
percent decline and the latest in a string of weaker-than-
expected economic reports.


Other indexes used in the survey were higher.


The Conference Board reported that the "coincident" index of
current activity increased 0.3 percent in February, after a 0.1
percent drop in January.


The "lagging" index of past activity rose 0.2 percent, after a
flat reading in January.
