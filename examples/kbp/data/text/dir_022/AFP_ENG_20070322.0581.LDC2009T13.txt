The Ethiopian-backed interim government in Somalia has ordered
the Mogadishu bureau of Al-Jazeera to halt its operations, the
Qatar-based news organization said Thursday.


"The Somali authorities have asked Al-Jazeera to stop its
activities from today," it said.


It is not the first time that the Somali government has taken
action against Al- Jazeera since its forces entered Mogadishu
backed by Ethiopian troops last December.


On January 15, the government ordered the closure of the Al-
Jazeera bureau for what it called "instigating violence" with
"unacceptable" news reports.


In recent weeks, government and Ethiopian troops have faced an
upsurge in attacks by suspected loyalists of the ousted Islamic
courts militia, particularly in the capital.


Some government officials have long accused al-Jazeera of giving
too much air time to the Islamists.
