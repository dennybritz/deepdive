Italian Foreign Minister Massimo d'Alema spoke with his US
counterpart Condoleezza Rice on Thursday following US criticism
of Rome's handling of the hostage crisis in Afghanistan, the US
embassy here said.


The conversation took place at around 4:00 pm (1500 GMT), the
embassy said, without elaborating.


The United States, Britain and The Netherlands said the swap of
kidnapped Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo for the
release of five Taliban militants could invite similar
kidnappings of NATO and Afghan troops battling the Taliban.


D'Alema planned to seek "clarification after the criticism from
an anonymous source" at the US State Department, a foreign
ministry official told AFP earlier.


Rome was "surprised" by the US criticism, the foreign ministry
official said, recalling a "very positive climate" during a
dinner meeting between D'Alema and Rice in Washington on Monday.
