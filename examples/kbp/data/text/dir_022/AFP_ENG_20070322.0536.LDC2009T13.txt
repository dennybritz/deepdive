Brian McCann sealed his long-term future with the Atlanta Braves
on Thursday, agreeing to terms on a new six-year contract with a
club option for 2013.


Financial terms were not disclosed.


The 23-year-old McCann enjoyed a breakthrough 2006 campaign,
batting .333 with 24 home runs and 93 RBI on route to his first
All-Star appearance.


The Braves put off a long-term commitment to McCann earlier this
spring, inking the catcher to a one-year contract.
