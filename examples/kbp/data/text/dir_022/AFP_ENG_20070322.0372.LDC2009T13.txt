Cameroon football officials have complained to FIFA that Arie
Haan's resignation as coach was a breach of contract, the
country's football federation Fecafoot said on Thursday.


Fecafoot are claiming Haan owes them 150,000 euros, or four
months salary, as he asked to have six months wages paid in
advance but he had only been in the post two months when he
resigned in January.


Fecafoot, who lodged their complaint with world football's
governing body FIFA on March 9, also said Haan had not given
30-day's notice of his departure.
