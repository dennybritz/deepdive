Egypt's main opposition parties announced on Thursday that they
will boycott a national referendum on controversial
constitutional amendments.


The liberal Wafd party, the leftist Tagammu party and the left-
leaning Nasserist and Karama parties are to boycott the
referendum to be held next Monday, the groups said.


"The Nasserist party will not participate in the referendum. A
boycott is the least we can do," Abdallah al-Sennawi, editor of
the Nasserist daily Al-Arabi, told AFP.


"Participating and voting 'no' will get us nowhere, because
experience of previous referenda shows that results are always
tampered with for the benefit of the authorities," he said.


"These amendments are a scandal... and a regression compared to
previous constitutions," Mahmud Abaza, head of the Wafd party,
told his party paper.


On Monday, the ruling party-dominated parliament overwhelmingly
passed amendments to 34 articles of the constitution that they
say will strengthen democracy and fight terrorism.


The opposition argued they will only strengthen the regime's grip
on power.


On Wednesday, the Muslim Brotherhood -- Egypt's largest
opposition movement -- already announced its intention to boycott
the referendum.
