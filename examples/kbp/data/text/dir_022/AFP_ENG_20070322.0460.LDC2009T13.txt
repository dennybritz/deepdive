The European Court of Human Rights on Thursday found Austria
violated the rights of a Bulgarian national living there by
deporting him for crimes he committed as a teenager.


Juri Maslov was expelled from Austria, where he had been living
since arriving legally with his family at the age of six, in
December 2003 following two convictions for burglary and assault
when he was 15 and 16.


The Strasbourg court ruled Austria's decision to ban Maslov for
10 years was "disproportionate" given the non-violent and
juvenile nature of his crimes.


The judges also noted his good behaviour following his second
release from prison in May 2002, and his lack of ties to Bulgaria
to where he was deported.


Maslov, now 23, was sentenced in September 1999 to 18 months in
prison, 13 of which were spent on probation, for burglary,
extortion and assault. He was also ordered to seek help for a
drug habit.


In May 2000 he appeared before the Vienna juvenile court a second
time for committing a string of burglaries, and received a
15-month prison term.


The court said his failure to attend drug treatment and his rapid
relapse into crime following his first conviction were
aggravating circumstances.


The European judges on Thursday ruled by four votes to three that
Austria had violated Maslov's right to respect for a private and
family life in deporting him, and awarded him 5,759.96 euros
(7,695.77 dollars) in costs.
