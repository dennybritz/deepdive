Slavia Prague's Stanislav Vlcek has been called up to the Czech
Republic national squad in an effort to bolster the strike force
for their Euro 2008 qualifier against Germany on Saturday.


National coach Karel Bruckner made the decision to bring in 31
-year-old Vlcek after Austria Vienna's forward David Latafa
failed to shake off a viral infection, announced the national
team's spokesman Lukas Tucek.


The Czech Republic will then face Cyprus four days later in
another Euro 2008 qualification match.


Germany occupy top spot in Group D on ten points with the Czech
Republic second on the same number of points but with a weaker
goal difference.
