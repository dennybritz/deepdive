Italian Foreign Minister Massimo d'Alema spoke with his US
counterpart on Thursday following US criticism of Rome's handling
of a recent hostage crisis in Afghanistan, the foreign ministry
said.


Confirming the conversation between d'Alema and US Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice, a ministry spokesman would not elaborate
on its content.


The United States, Britain and The Netherlands said the swap of
kidnapped Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo for the
release of five Taliban militants could invite similar
kidnappings of NATO and Afghan troops battling the Taliban.


D'Alema planned to seek "clarification after the criticism from
an anonymous source" at the US State Department, a foreign
ministry official told AFP earlier.


Rome was "surprised" by the US criticism, the foreign ministry
official said, recalling a "very positive climate" during a
dinner meeting between D'Alema and Rice in Washington on Monday.
