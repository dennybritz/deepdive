Australia captain George Gregan is to follow in the footsteps of
his former New Zealand counterpart Tana Umaga and join French
second division team Toulon.


Scrum-half Gregan, who holds the world record for the most
international caps with 127, has agreed to join the French club
after the World Cup in September and October.


The 33-year-old, who was born in Lusaka, Zambia, won the World
Cup with Australia in 1999 and also the Tri-Nations in 2000 and
2001.


He will join for a full season as Toulon try to repeat the
raoring success they experienced when former All Blacks captain
Umaga joined for several weeks last season.
