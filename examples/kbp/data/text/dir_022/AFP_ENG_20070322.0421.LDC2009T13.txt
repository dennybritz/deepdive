Rembrandt's 400th birthday celebrations were dubbed a roaring
success on Thursday, resulting in nearly 200 million euros (270
million dollars) in additional spending, organisers said.


"With 2.1 million visitors, it has been the most successful event
ever organised in the Netherlands," said Jan Michiel Hessels,
director of organisers Rembrandt 400.


Visitors who came to the country specifically for the series of
events celebrating the works of the 17th-century painter spent
190 million euros, according to Rembrandt 400.


A total of 623 million euros (832 dollars) were spent by all
visitors to official events, the organisation said.


Hessels said the group had hoped to attract 450,000 foreign
visitors to Dutch museums, and anticipated 100 million euros
being spent.


Overall, last year was a record for tourism in the Netherlands,
with 10.6 million visitors to the country.


Nearly 70 percent of visitors to Rembrandt events were foreign,
often of European origin.


Americans, however, were the most numerous, with 215,000
visitors.
