British insurance group Standard Life said Thursday that it would
shed 1,000 jobs in its home market as part of a major cost-
cutting drive that will last until 2009.


News of the job cuts, which amount to almost one tenth of the
total workforce, came as the company unveiled a 55-percent jump
in profits last year.


Pre-tax operating profit leapt to 614 million pounds (905 million
euros, 1.209 billion dollars), compared with 395 million the
previous year, Standard Life said in its annual earnings release.


The result beat market expecations for a profit of 503 million
pounds.


Standard Life, which was floated on the London stock market last
July, also outlined plans to slash its annual costs by 100
million pounds by 2009.


"Through efficiency and productivity we can achieve a reduction
in the underlying headcount requirement to service our existing
levels of business by around 1,000 by 2009," the group said in
the results statement.


Most of Standard Life's operations are in Britain, where the
group employs 8,500 staff. The company has a global workforce of
10,500 people, with operations also in Canada, China, Germany,
Hong Kong, India and Ireland.
