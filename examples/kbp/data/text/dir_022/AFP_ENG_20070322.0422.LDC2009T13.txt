An Iranian couple and their nine-year-old Canadian son arrived
overnight in Canada after spending six weeks in a US jail, media
reported Thursday.


Majid and Masomeh Yourdkhani, and their son Kevin had been
detained by US authorities when their international flight to
Canada made an unscheduled stop in the United States.


US officials discovered they were using stolen travel documents.


Their plight captivated Canadians after Kevin sent a letter,
written in crayon, to Prime Minister Stephen Harper pleading for
help.


Last week, Canada's Immigration Minister Diane Finley gave the
family temporary residency permits to enter Canada.


"They're all very relieved ... Kevin is excited at the same time
to be home," their attorney Andrew Brouwer told public
broadcaster CBC Thursday.


Kevin's parents had sought asylum in Canada 10 years ago, but
were unsuccessful and were deported back to Iran in December
2005. Kevin was born when they lived in Canada.


His parents said they faced torture in Iran and made a second
attempt in February to seek refuge in Canada, using stolen Greek
passports.


But their flight from Guyana to Toronto on February 4 was
diverted to Puerto Rico when a passenger suffered a heart attack
and died en route.


The family was held in Puerto Rico for five days, then moved to a
converted medium-security prison near Austin, Texas, a move that
has been condemned by human rights groups.
