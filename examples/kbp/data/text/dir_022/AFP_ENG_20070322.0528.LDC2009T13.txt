Real Madrid's Brazilian defensive midfielder Emerson admitted
Thursday that he is a long way from his previous level of play.


Emerson has been roundly jeered by the Bernabeu faithful since
signing from Italians Juventus at the beginning of the season and
said he is not even playing half as well as he did for his
previous clubs, which include Roma and Bayer Leverkusen.


"I'm working hard to improve because I'm not even playing at half
the level I was at with my previous teams," he said. "I need to
work to improve and to be ready for 'mister' (Real coach Fabio
Capello)."


The 30-year-old is not the only Capello signing to have admitted
he is not playing his best in the white of Real.


World player of the year Fabio Cannavaro said at the beginning of
the month that he was not at his best while Malian midfielder
Mahamadou Diarra said in February that he was not satisfied with
his own form.


"If I had to give myself a grade, it would be mediocre," said
Diarra at the time.


Emerson was speaking at a press conference where he also denied
reports that he had refused to come on as a substitute in Real's
Champions League second round, first leg clash against Bayern
Munich.


"I have never refused to play, for me the matter is closed," he
added.
