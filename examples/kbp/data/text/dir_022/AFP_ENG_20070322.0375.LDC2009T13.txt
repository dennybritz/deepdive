Polish police said on Thursday that they have arrested three
British citizens in Warsaw after they were caught using a haul of
forged credit cards to withdraw cash.


Officers seized 85 phoney cards from the suspected fraudsters,
Warsaw police spokeswoman Dorota Tietz was quoted as saying by
the PAP news agency.


Police made the arrests late on Wednesday night after having been
alerted by a bank employee who noticed suspect withdrawals from a
branch in central Warsaw.


Officers found two individuals in possession of several hundred
euros and several thousand zlotys, as well as a total of 55 fake
cards inscribed with personal identification numbers (PINs).


A second person was later caught with 30 similar cards.


"Everything points to their being part of the same gang," said
Tietz.


Under Polish law, the three could face eight years in prison.


The cards appeared to have been forged in Britain, but the
suspected gang members may have opted to use them in Poland
because differences between the two countries' systems made it
easier to pass off the fakes as genuine.


"In Britain, cards have a microchip, so they would have been
unable to use a card with just a magnetic strip to withdraw cash
there," Tietz said.


Criminal gangs around the world often produce fakes encoded with
genuine, stolen credit card details, in order to make payments
and cash withdrawals at the expense of victims of data theft.


Encoding data into a magnetic strip is cheaper and easier than
trying to fake a microchip.
