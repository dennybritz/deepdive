Sunday's Group Six African Nations Cup qualifier between hosts
Kenya and Swaziland will be played at the Nyayo National Stadium,
scene of a deadly fan stampede two years ago, officials said on
Thursday.


The stadium was banned for six months in 2005 following the death
of a schoolboy and injuries to 15 other fans in the stampede by
overzealous fans waiting to purchase tickets for the June 18
World Cup qualifier against Morocco.


As a result, Kenya were heavily penalised by the sport's world
governing body FIFA with the next match against the-then African
champions Tunisia being played behind-closed-doors at the
Kasarani stadium.


The possibility of a repeat of those ugly scenes looked likely
after the Kenya Football Federation announced that tickets would
go on sale on Sunday morning only hours before the match kicked
off.


However KFF officials said security for the match had been beefed
up and the manning of the stadium gates would be controlled by a
local security firm to avoid manipulation by interested parties.


Kenya need to beat fellow strugglers Swaziland to have any
realistic chances of reaching the 2008 finals in Ghana. Only the
winner in each group along with hosts Ghana will qualify.
