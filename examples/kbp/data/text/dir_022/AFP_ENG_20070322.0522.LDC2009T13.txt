The White House warned on Thursday that the opposition Democrats'
plan to link the Iraq war budget with a timetable for military
withdrawal had "zero chance" and would face a presidential veto.


The spending and war-cutoff bill under consideration "has zero
chance to be enacted into law," White House spokesman Tony Snow
said. "It's bad legislation. The president is going to veto it
and Congress will sustain that veto."


The Democratic-controlled Congress is holding a debate Thursday
ahead of a vote Friday on the controversial 124 billion dollar
measure for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.


President George W. Bush has urged lawmakers to approve the
budget commitment in full and without restrictions on how it can
be spent.


Top Democrats want to link approval of the money to a mandated
withdrawal of US forces from Iraq by August 31, 2008. The party's
left wing wants legislators to approve the funding only on
condition that the troops begin to withdraw this year.


Snow described the bill as "fatally flawed."


"It ties the hands of our generals. It does so by putting
politicians and staffers in charge of the kinds of things that
need to be determined on the battlefield. That is a formula for
failure," he said.
