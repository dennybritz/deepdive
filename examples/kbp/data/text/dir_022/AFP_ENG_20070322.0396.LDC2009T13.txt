The United States on Thursday blamed a "technical issue" for
delays in unblocking North Korean funds and said Pyongyang must
"live up to" denuclearization pledges.


"We expect them to live up to their commitments but, at this
point, this is not an issue of American unwillingness. It's a
technical issue in terms of fund transferring," said White House
spokesman Tony Snow.


The issue has been delaying efforts to implement a multinational
deal under which the North would shut down its nuclear programs
and admit UN nuclear watchdog inspectors in exchange for economic
and diplomatic benefits.


The United States said on Monday it had struck a deal to release
all the North Korean assets frozen in a Macau bank, Banco Delta
Asia, since September 2005.


"We in fact have completed the actions necessary to resolve the
Banko Delta issue and we hope that the mechanics of transferring
the funds out of that bank are not going to slow the six party
talks," said Snow.


"In other words, we've done our part. So at this point it's a
technical issue," said the spokesman, who did not spell out what
the problem was.


"North Korea also retains an obligation to allow the IAEA
inspectors and that is part of the deal, I have mentioned this
Many times, and to close down (the Yongbyon site) within the next
30 days," said Snow.
