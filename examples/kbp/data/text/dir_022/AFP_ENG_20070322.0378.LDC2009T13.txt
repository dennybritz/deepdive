Cypriot authorities warned Thursday that anyone defying a
hosepipe ban will incur on-the-spot fines as the drought-hit
holiday island braces for a long hot summer.


Agriculture Minister Photis Photiou marked World Water Day by
stressing the government would get tough on offenders by
enforcing 50-pound (115-dollar) penalty fines.


"People washing their car three times a week and hosing down
their house and pavement can't go on any longer," Photiou told
reporters.


"We've given time for people to comply with the law but for those
who still don't understand, the law will be strictly enforced,"
he added.


The government passed a decree last month enabling officials to
impose spot fines for "unnecessary wastage of water".


Photiou said Cyprus was one step away from compulsory water
rationing if the public continued to waste a precious resource.


Cyprus is facing a severe water shortage with dams at less than a
quarter full despite a bout of recent rainfall.


Moreover, after April, heavy rain is not expected until the
winter months, although last December -- which usually covers 25
percent of Cyprus water reserves -- was one of the driest on
record.


As part of a longer term solution to the island's water problems
the government plans to build more desalination plants.
