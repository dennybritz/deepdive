A senior US trade envoy urged Gulf investors Thursday not to be
put off investing in the United States by Dubai port operator DP
World's abortive acquisition of six US ports.


Assistant Commerce Secretary Israel Hernandez acknowledged that
the sale by the United Arab Emirates firm of its US ports
subsidiary last week after the aquisition set off a congressional
storm had been a "step backwards".


"We learned last year in an almost painful fashion with the
controversy over DPW, which was a step backwards," Hernandez told
reporters in the Qatari capital Doha.


"We don't want the investment process to be decided based on
politics or by propagandizing, but on a rational, commercial
basis and what is in the nation's best interest.


"This means the US federal government has a role to play to move
this process forward."


DP World had acquired its US operations early last year through
its 6.9 billion dollar acquisition of P&O -- a deal making it
one of the world's largest port operators.


But following fierce congressional opposition to the US part of
the deal on security grounds, and despite the backing of
President Geroge W. Bush, the Dubai government decided in March
to relinquish DP World's operations at six US ports.
