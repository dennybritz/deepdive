Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said he hoped Gaza militants
would soon release a captive Israeli soldier in an interview with
Israeli television parts of which were broadcast on Thursday.


"I hope that this soldier will swiftly be able to regain his
freedom," Abbas said.


He said he had reached agreement on a "mechanism to resolve this
problem" with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.


"This mechanism was accepted by the Egyptians and the captors and
I hope that Palestinian prisoners will also be released" from
jail in Israel, he said.


"The discussions have made progress," he added, without
elaborating.


Gaza-based militants, including some from the military wing of
the Islamist Hamas movement of prime minister Ismail Haniya,
seized Corporal Gilad Shalit in a deadly cross-border raid last
June.


It was the first interview Abbas had given to Israeli television
since a new coalition government including both Hamas and his
secular Fatah party took power last Saturday.


Setting out the new government's programme to parliament, Haniya
said it would "work, and encourage the parties concerned to work,
to speed up the resolution of the problem of the captive Israeli
soldier within the framework of a prisoner exchange agreement."


Israeli television said it would broadcast the Abbas interview in
full on Friday evening.
