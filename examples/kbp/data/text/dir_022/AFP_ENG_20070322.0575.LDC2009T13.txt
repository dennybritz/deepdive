The boss of French oil group Total has been placed under judicial
investigation, the first step to formal charges, as part of a
corruption probe into a gas deal signed by the company in Iran, a
source close to the case told AFP Thursday.


Total chief executive Christophe de Margerie was detained by
French police on Wednesday before being transferred to a serious
financial crime unit a day later, judicial officials told AFP.


The French oil company is suspected of paying top Iranian
officials nearly 100 million Swiss francs (60 million euros, 80
million dollars) through two Swiss bank accounts to win a
contract in 1997.
