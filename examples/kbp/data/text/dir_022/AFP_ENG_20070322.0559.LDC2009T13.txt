A former US envoy to the Balkans Thursday vehemently denied a
report that the United States guaranteed the "life-long safety"
of indicted Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.


"This is a crude and obvious forgery," said Ashley Bommer, chief
of staff for Richard Holbrooke, the former US envoy to the
Balkans.


On Thursday, the Montenegrin daily Republika reported that
Karadzic, who has been wanted by UN war crimes tribunal since
1995, agreed to withdraw from public life in exchange for the
assurance.


The report was published alongside what Republika said was a copy
of the June 1996 agreement apparently bearing the signatures of
Karadzic and Richard Holbrooke, the former US envoy to the
Balkans.


In 2004, Karadzic's wife, Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic, said that such
a document existed.


Karadzic and his former military chief Ratko Mladic have been at
large since they were indicted by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) more than 11 years ago.


They face charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and
genocide, mainly in relation to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of
8,000 Muslim men and boys, the single worst atrocity in Europe
since World War II.
