Chinese action hero Jet Li is in negotiations to play the villain
in the third instalment of the succesful "Mummy" films, it was
reported on Thursday.


Li, most recently seen in "Fearless" and period epic "Hero",
would star as the mummified monster as the action moves to China,
according to movie industry journal The Hollywood Reporter.


Although plot details are being kept secret, the film would begin
in ancient times before switching to a post World-War II setting.


One scene would also involve the terracotta warriors, the
collection of several thousand men and their horses that were
originally constructed to protect the tomb of a Qin dynasty
emperor.


The "Mummy" films have grossed nearly 850 million dollars
worldwide since the launch of the first movie in the series "The
Mummy" in 1999.
