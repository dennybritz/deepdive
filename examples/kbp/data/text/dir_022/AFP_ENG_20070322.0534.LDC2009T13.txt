Bulldozers began ripping down a slum residence in Casablanca's
working-class Sidi Moumen district Thursday, more than a week
after a suicide bomber blew himself up there.


The first phase of demolition got underway on 120 homes in the
Douar Skouila residence, a town hall official said, adding that
around 2,000 dwellings are to be pulled down.


Work on the 1960s complex had been scheduled to start in 2009 but
was brought forward because of the March 11 attack, he said.


Abdelfettah Raydi blew himself up in a cybercafe after an
argument with its supervisor, injuring four others.


Families in Douar Skouila have received financial aid and been
temporarily rehoused nearby.


Construction work on affordable housing, sports stadiums and a
cultural centre has been ongoing in the Sidi Moumen district
since a wave of bomb attacks in 2003, which killed 45 people.
