US President George W. Bush on Thursday urged lawmakers to
approve his emergency spending request for Iraq in full and
without restrictions on how it can be spent.


"Congress needs to get that bill out as quickly as possible,
without a lot of extra spending and without a lot of strings to
it," Bush said of the controversial 120 billion dollar measure
for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.


Top Democrats want to link approval of the money to a withdrawal
of US forces from Iraq by August 31, 2008. However the party's
leftist base wants the legislators to approve the funding only on
condition that the troops begin to withdraw this year.


Bush made his comments as he met with leaders of so-called
Provincial Reconstruction Teams operating in Iraq. They are
composed of military and civilian personnel whose main focus is
security and rebuilding work.


"The Congress owes you the money you need to do the job, without
any strings attached," said the US president, whose popularity is
at record lows in part because of the unpopular war.


"We don't want you to go into Iraq and then have unnecessary
strings placed upon the money so you can't do your job," he said.
"Congress needs to get their business done quickly, get the
monies we've requested funded, and let our folks on the ground do
the job."


Bush has warned that he will veto the legislation in its current
form.
