The Greek coast guard on Thursday mounted a search for a Croatian
sailor who fell overboard from his freighter during a storm in
the southwestern Aegean Sea, the merchant marine ministry said.


The man fell overboard in unspecified conditions from the Lea, a
Panamanian- flagged freighter sailing near the southeastern
Peloponnese, near the island of Kythera.


Winds of up to 50 kilometres (31 miles) per hour were blowing in
the area, the ministry said.


Greece is currently caught in a storm front with winds reaching
up to 90 kilometres an hour in some areas.
