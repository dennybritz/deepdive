India said late Thursday it will pay the equivalent of 8,000
dollars to families of those killed in deadly sectarian riots in
western India in 2002 that targeted mainly Muslims.


The compensation package for the families of 1,169 victims of the
Gujarat riots was approved at a Cabinet meeting, the federal
government said in a statement.


"The next-of-kin would be paid ex-gratia at 350,000 rupees, which
would be in addition to (the) amount already paid by the state
government," the statement said.


The government will also supplement state-government aid given to
2,548 people injured in the riots of up to 125,000 rupees each,
the statement said.


A minister told reporters the government was using the figures
for the dead and injured provided by the state government, but
that other cases could be considered, a report in the Press Trust
of India news agency said.


Human rights groups say the death toll is closer to 2,000, mostly
Muslims attacked by Hindu mobs, and accuse the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party state government of turning a blind eye as
the riots raged.


The February 2002 violence was sparked when a Muslim mob was
accused of torching a train carriage in the town of Godhra,
killing 59 Hindu pilgrims. Officials later found the fire was an
accident.


The compensation announcement comes a year after police reopened
an investigation into the sectarian violence on the instructions
of India's Supreme Court.
