Teenage French striker Gilles Sunu will join Arsenal in July
after the English Premiership team came to an agreement with his
club Chateauroux.


The Londoners will pay between one and four million euros for the
16-year-old, who will sign a four year deal next month when
Chateauroux president Michel Denisot meets his Arsenal
counterpart David Dein.


The French under-16s international is the son of former Togo
international Manu Sunu.
