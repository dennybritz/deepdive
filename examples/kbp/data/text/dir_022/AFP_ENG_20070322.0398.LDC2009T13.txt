Bulgaria plans to have eight percent of farmland devoted to
organic farming by 2013 in a new development strategy,
Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil said Thursday.


Bulgaria, which has rarely used fertilisers or pesticides since
the fall of communism due to a lack of funds, has good potential
for organic farming, the ministry said.


Organic farming, as a conscious alternative to using certain
chemicals that can be health risks, is just starting in this
country, with 150 farmers and eight commercial companies
involved, with 329 cattle, 1,167 sheep and 708 beehives, the
minister said.


Some 3,060 hectares (7,561 acres) of land are used to grow
organic crops, while another 110,000 hectares are reserved for
medicinal plants and wild fruit, he added.


Bulgaria's bio products, including honey, spices, rose oil,
cucumbers, tomatoes and medicinal plants, are exported mainly to
Germany but also to Switzerland, the Netherlands and France.


A large exporter of agricultural products during the communist
era, Bulgaria dismantled the old cooperatives in 1990 before
restoring lands to former owners.


But farmers have in recent years started buying more land or
forming partnerships with other landowners in order to build
farms that can benefit from European Union funds.
