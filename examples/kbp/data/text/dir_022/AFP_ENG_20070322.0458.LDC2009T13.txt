The EU has extended its sanctions against Belarus for a year and,
a diplomatic source said Thursday, will keep a close eye on the
upcoming anniversary of protests there against a "rigged"
presidential election.


The European Union has since 2004 banned certain Belarussian
officials from entering member states due to human rights abuses.


However the main sanctions, which in particular prevent
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko from entering the EU,
were imposed after the presidential election of March 19, 2006
when he was re-elected amid accusations of human rights
violations and undemocratic practices.


In total, some 40 Belarussians are affected by the travel ban
which is accompanied by an assets freeze.


The EU sanctions against Belarus, sometimes dubbed the last
dictatorship in Europe, will be extended until April 10, 2008, EU
ministers agreed this week.


"An important moment in time will be this weekend, the
anniversary of demonstrations against the rigged election," one
EU diplomatic source said.


"It would be interesting to see if something will be going on and
whether the regime will react to that in Belarus".


On March 25 last year, riot police beat protesters and arrested a
prominent opposition leader following a peaceful rally against
Lukashenko.
