Human rights groups on Thursday said the  Spanish government were
evading responsibility for atrocities committed during the
country's bloody civil war over 70 years ago.


A draft law to formally recognise the victims of the 1936-39
conflict and General Franco's ensuing military dictatorship was
presented to parliament last year.


With this bill "the Spanish state assumes no responsibility for
the atrocious crimes," said Wilder Taylor of Human Rights Watch
on Thursday, after meeting with government officials.


Taylor agreed that an amendment to the draft, which suppresses
the naming of alleged offenders, was an improvement.


However, he said the "right to the truth is the cardinal point,"
and that in today's draft that right is not recognised.


The bill has deeply divided the government since December, with
the right saying it would only open old wounds.


Supporters of socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero -- whose grandfather was killed by Franco's troops --
say it does not go far enough.


Criticising the bill for not respecting the principles of "truth,
justice and reparation," Amnesty International's Javier Zuniga on
Thursday urged the government to ensure all victims were given
access to the truth.


He added that it was important to "protect the 'archives of
repression' which have conserved vital information and which
today, for many, are in a lamentable condition."


Some 50,000 anti-Franco Republicans were sentenced to death
between the end of the war and Franco's death in 1975. Tens of
thousands of other opponents were thrown into jails.


Spain adopted a new constitution in 1978, which ushered in
democratic rule.
