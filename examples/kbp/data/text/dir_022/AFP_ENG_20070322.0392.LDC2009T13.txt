Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp and Wigan boss Paul Jewell were
fined by the Football Association on Thursday for bad behaviour.


Redknapp was fined 750 pounds and warned as to his future conduct
while Wigan manager Paul Jewell was fined 2,000 pounds and given
a two-match touchline ban, suspended for 12 months, following an
FA Disciplinary Commission hearing.


Redknapp was charged with insulting a match official during the
Premiership game against Manchester City on February 10,
following which he was sent from the technical area.


Jewell was also warned as to his future behaviour after admitting
a charge of improper conduct towards referee Phil Dowd last month
when he reacted furiously at full-time following his side's 2-1
Premiership defeat by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on February
11.


Jewell has until March 30 to respond to a separate charge of
improper conduct and/or bringing the game into disrepute
regarding his post-match media comments relating to the same
game.
