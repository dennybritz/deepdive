Pakistan said on Thursday it would confer its highest civil award
on late national cricket coach Bob Woolmer, officials said.


President Pervez Musharraf conveyed the decision to Gill Woolmer,
the widow of the coach, in a condolence letter he sent to her on
Thursday, an official said.


The South African-born Woolmer, 58, died Sunday in the West
Indies a day after Pakistan's shock exit from the World Cup
following a defeat to minnows Ireland. Police in Jamaica said
they were treating the death as suspicious.


"The sudden passing away of the much respected and loved coach of
Pakistan cricket team deeply grieved me, just as it did the
entire Pakistani nation," Musharraf said in the letter.


The Pakistani leader said Woolmer did his job with great
distinction and commitment.


"Pakistan cricket shall forever be indebted to his services and
this nation will always remember him for the joys he brought into
the lives of millions of Pakistanis.


"In recognition of his valuable contribution in the field of
sports the government of Pakistan has decided to honour Mr Bob
Woolmer with the civil award of Sitara-i-Imtiaz (star of
distinction)."


Officials said the posthumous award is expected to be received by
Woolmer's widow in the Pakistani capital on August 14 on the
occasion of the country's 60th independence day.
