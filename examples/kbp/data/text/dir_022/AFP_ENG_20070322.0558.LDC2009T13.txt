Saudi authorities announced Thursday that they had found H5N1
bird flu in captive birds, in the kingdom's first outbreak of the
strain of the disease that is dangerous to humans.


Laboratory tests found the strain in turkeys, parrots, peacocks
and ostriches at a farm in the Eastern Province, an agriculture
ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency
said.


The ministry gave no figures for the number of cases but said
that measures had been taken to stop the disease spreading.


The neighbouring Gulf state of Kuwait has reported a spate of
cases of H5N1 bird flu in fowl since February 25, many of them in
Wafra, close to the border.


But of some 300 people tested for infection by the disease, not
one has so far tested positive.
