Sampdoria striker Francesco Flachi could face a two-year ban from
football after a second urine sample confirmed on Thursday that
he had tested positive for cocaine.


The 31-year-old originally tested positive after a 2-0 defeat at
home to Inter Milan in Serie A on January 28 and was immediately
suspended.


On Thursday the anti-doping laboratory of the Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) confirmed Flachi's test to be positive for
cocaine after examining a 'B' sample.


Flachi now faces a hearing with CONI's anti-doping commission in
the next two weeks and they will decide on his punishment.


Flachi was banned for two months by the Italian football
federation (FIGC) last September for his role in an illegal
gambling ring.


Messina goalkeeper Nicholas Caglioni also tested positive for
cocaine earlier this month and is waiting for his 'B' sample to
be examined.
