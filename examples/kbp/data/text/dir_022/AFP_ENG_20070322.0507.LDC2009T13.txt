Support for bringing back the death penalty has slipped in
Poland, with almost two-thirds now in favour of restoring capital
punishment, according to an opinion poll published Thursday.


The survey of 931 people by the CBOS institute found that 63
percent of Poles favour the restoration of capital punishment
while 31 percent are opposed.


A similar poll by CBOS in 2004, the year Poland joined the
European Union, found 77 percent backing.


Poland stopped handing out the death penalty in 1988, a year
before the collapse of the communist regime, and abolished
capital punishment in 1997. The toughest sentence that can now be
handed out by Polish courts is life imprisonment.


In recent years, however, the issue has returned to spark
disputes between Warsaw and other European nations.


In 2005, President Lech Kaczynski said that he was a supporter of
the death penalty and wanted to see a debate in Europe on
restoring capital punishment.


And last year, the extreme-right League of Polish Families, a
junior partner in the government, announced that it aimed to
collect half a million signatures of EU citizens on a petition
demanding the death penalty for paedophile murderers.


Both calls drew an angry salvo from human rights groups.


Seeking to calm the spat, Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski --
the president's twin brother -- said last year that there was "no
chance" that Poland would restore the death penalty.


Abolishing capital punishment is a condition of joining the
27-nation EU.
