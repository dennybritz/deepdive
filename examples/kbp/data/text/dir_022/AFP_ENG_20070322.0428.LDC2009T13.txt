UEFA's new president Michel Platini has told police and
government officials that he supports a policy of "zero
tolerance" towards violence in and around football stadiums in
Europe.


Platini made the comments in a meeting behind closed doors at
UEFA headquarters on Wednesday, which was the first of a series
European football's governing body is planning to tackle football
violence.


"We have seen a worrying upturn in the number of acts of violence
at football matches across Europe recently, both inside and
outside stadiums, some resulting in tragic loss of life," he said
in remarks released by UEFA.


"I support a policy of zero tolerance, and we at UEFA will do our
part to stop incidents on the pitch," Platini added.


"But I encourage the group of specialists and experts gathered
here to go as far as you can in translating your own knowledge,
and in sharing the best methods among yourselves, in order to
further extend this base to a European level."


The gathering followed an appeal by Platini for more government
involvement and cooperation to stamp out football violence when
he met European Union president Jose Manuel Barroso earlier this
month.


It brought together ministry and police specialists from Austria,
Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,
Scotland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
