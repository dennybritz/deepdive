Six members of a Russian far-right group have been arrested in
Saint Petersburg over the bombing of a McDonald's there that
injured six people, police said on Thursday.


Initial inquiries suggest the suspects are members of a small
extremist group that has also committed racist attacks in the
city, a local police source said.


The explosion in the fast-food restaurant in central Saint
Petersburg on February 18 injured five women and one man,
including a German tourist.


Attacks by groups of skinheads have increased in recent years in
Russia and notably in Saint Petersburg.


They are normally aimed at people from the Caucusus and the
former Soviet republics in central Asia, although Asians and
Africans have been targeted.
