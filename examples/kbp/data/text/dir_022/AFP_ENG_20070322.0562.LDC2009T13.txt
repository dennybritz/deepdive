British sports minister Richard Caborn has given his backing to a
proposal revealed this week by Silverstone circuit officials
aiming to ensure the British Grand Prix remains on the world
championship calendar.


The British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), which owns the track,
gave a presentation to local and regional authorities in the
presence of Caborn.


Races in the Middle and Far East are becoming more and more
attractive, and, with the British race only secured until 2009,
BRDC president and former Formula One world champion Damon Hill
conceded the race was "hanging in the balance."


The BRDC are hoping if the idea is approved by the relevant
authorities, it will help provide the finances required to
redevelop the circuit and guarantee its place on the calendar
beyond 2009.


The plan includes new grandstands, pit and paddock facilities, a
science park, manufacturer test centre, a small amount of
residential development, a hotel and conference centre.


Caborn said: "The master plan really builds on the Silverstone
brand and shows a great deal of potential.


"It outlines the beginnings of a major Centre of Excellence that
will rank up there with any in the world helping to ensure the
supply chain to this sector is maintained for years to come.


"The master plan is not only important to Silverstone and its
continued hosting of the British Grand Prix, but also the
development of the sport in this country."
