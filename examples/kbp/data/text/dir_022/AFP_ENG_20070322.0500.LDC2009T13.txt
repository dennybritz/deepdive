World and European football's governing bodies FIFA and UEFA have
given their backing to the Macedonian Football Association in its
dispute with its government.


FIFA statutes deem that national football associations must be
free from government meddling.


FIFA and UEFA released a joint statement after the Macedonian FA
met with the two bodies' respective presidents Sepp Blatter and
Michel Platini.


"FIFA and UEFA condemn the Macedonian government's repeated
interference aimed at undermining the association and its
leaders' legitimacy and reiterate that such interference
constitutes a breach of Article 17 of the FIFA Statutes and
Article 7 of the UEFA Statutes," said the two bodies in the
statement.


"FIFA and UEFA furthermore reiterate their demand that the
Macedonian government restore the situation to normality and
immediately cease all interference in the association's affairs.


"Failing this, FIFA and UEFA shall agree on the measures to be
taken in accordance with the sanctions provided for such
circumstances in their statutes."


Neither body affirmed what those measures might be but other
countries have been banned from international football after
their governments interfered in the affairs of the national
football association.


Iran was suspended for three weeks last year over similar reasons
while FIFA only resolved a dispute with the Polish government
earlier this month.
