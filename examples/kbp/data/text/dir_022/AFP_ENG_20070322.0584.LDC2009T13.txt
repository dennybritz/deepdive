Ambitious plans to link Europe to Africa via an underwater rail
tunnel took a step closer on Thursday after Morocco said it would
launch a search for finance this year, officials said.


"It is a very ambitious project and the budgets are very large,"
said Morocco's Minister of Equipment and Transport Karim Ghellab.


Under proposals the tunnel would be 38.7 kilometres long, with 28
kilometres of it running up to 400 metres (1,200 feet) under the
Strait of Gibraltar.


A journey of 450 kilometres between Rabat and Seville, a city in
south Spain, would be possible in two-and-a-half hours, said
Ghellab.


Spanish public company SECEG and Moroccan counterpart SNED last
September commissioned a four-company consortium to draw up plans
for the tunnel.
