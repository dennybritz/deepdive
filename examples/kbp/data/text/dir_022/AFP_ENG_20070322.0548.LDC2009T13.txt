EU transport ministers approved on Thursday an agreement with
Russia to phase out huge taxes paid by European airlines flying
over Siberia, EU officials said.


The agreement, which was signed in late November in Helsinki, is
to enter into force on September 1, 2007, and brings an end to a
problem that has soured EU- Russian relations for 20 years.


Under the agreement, Russia is to gradually reduce the taxes
until they are entirely scrapped at the end of 2013 and is to
offer new routes over Siberia which will not be subject to taxes
in the meantime.


The charges, which cost EU airlines some 430 million euros (541
million dollars) in 2006, are virtually impossible for airlines
to avoid. Any detour to avoid Siberian airspace becomes too
costly in jet fuel and time lost.


The EU had argued that the charges violate the 1944 Chicago
Convention on International Civil Aviation which states that no
state shall impose non- commercial transit charges.


The revenues have been a blessing for Moscow, which has passed on
part of them to Russian carrier Aeroflot.
