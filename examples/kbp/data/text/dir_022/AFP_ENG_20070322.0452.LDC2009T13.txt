Polish Olympic champion swimmer Otylia Jedrzejczak was spared
prison Thursday but ordered to do community service for a car
crash two years ago which killed her younger brother.


The district court in the central Polish city of Plonsk said
Jedrzejczak should perform 30 hours' community service per month
over the coming nine months, and be stripped her of her driving
licence for a year.


The sentence by the district court was lighter than the one-year
suspended prison term sought by prosecutors.


Under Polish law, 23-year-old Jedrzejczak could have been
sentenced to eight years in prison for involuntary manslaughter.


A car Jedrzejczak was driving smashed into a tree as she tried to
overtake several vehicles at high speed on a two-lane road near
Plonsk, 70 kilometers (42 miles) northwest of Warsaw, in October
2005.


Her 19-year-old brother Szymon, who was a national-level swimmer,
died instantly.


Jedrzejczak was seriously injured, but left hospital six weeks
after the crash and made a successful return to competition in
March 2006, winning two European titles in Budapest the same
year.


Prior to the accident, she had won a string of honours, including
gold in the 200 metres butterfly at the Athens Olympics in 2004,
and two successive world titles in the stroke, in Barcelona in
2003 and Montreal in 2005.


Jedrzejczak was not in court Friday as she is currently with the
Polish team at the world championships in Melbourne, where she is
expected to defend her butterfly title on March 29.
