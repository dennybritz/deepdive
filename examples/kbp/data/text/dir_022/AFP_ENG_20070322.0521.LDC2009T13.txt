At least two people were killed and several more injured Thursday
when a military arsenal exploded near Mozambique's international
airport, local television reported.


Bombs, mines and rounds of ammunition exploded in the severe heat
of the late afternoon in the south-eastern African country,
reported the private-owned TVM station.


The blast also caused a large amount of damage to nearby
buildings, shattering the glass and windows in many offices.


There was no reaction from the army into the cause of the
explosion.


Mozambique was locked in a vicious civil war between 1975 and
1992 but has been largely peaceful since then.
