A total of 69 people were killed and more than 77,000 left
homeless after a cyclone struck northern Madagascar last week,
authorities said Thursday in a sharp upward revision of the toll.


The national emergencies agency, the BNGRC, said new figures
showed that 33 people were killed in the town of Port-Berge, in
addition to the 36 dead elsewhere counted up to Wednesday.


The BNGRC said 77,674 people were made homeless, up from 53,750.
In addition, 17 bridges and 40 public buildings had been damaged,
and 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of ricefields destroyed.


Cyclone Indlaha is by far the deadliest of the six to have hit
Madagascar so far this season.


Three years ago cyclone Gafilo left 241 people dead in the Indian
Ocean island.
