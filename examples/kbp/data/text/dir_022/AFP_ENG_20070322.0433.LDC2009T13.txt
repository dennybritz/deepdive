King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia kept his ministerial line-up
unchanged on Thursday, putting paid to long-standing rumours of
an imminent reshuffle.


"All members of the current cabinet will be kept in their posts,"
said a royal decree carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.


There had been rumours since the sudden resignation of Saudi
ambassador to Washington Prince Turki al-Faisal in December that
his brother, veteran Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal,
would also stand down.


Prince Turki, who served 27 years as intelligence chief before a
brief stint as ambassador in London, had served just 15 months in
Washington before his abrupt departure, prompting the Washington
Post to speculate about a rift within the Saudi royal family.


Thursday's decree was the second time that the existing cabinet
had been retained in office since its appointment in February
2005.


In August that year, when King Abdullah mounted the throne on the
death of king Fahd, he kept the line-up appointed by his brother.
