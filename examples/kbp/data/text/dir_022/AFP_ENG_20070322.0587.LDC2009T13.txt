British rock giants the Rolling Stones announced Thursday the
dates of their European tour -- set to take in countries such as
Serbia and Ukraine for the first time.


The 27-show Bigger Bang tour starts on June 5 in Werchter,
Belgium and wraps up with a homecoming gig in London on August
21.


In a webcast to announce the dates, 63-year-old frontman Mick
Jagger insisted he was not daunted by the gruelling itinerary,
saying: "I never get tired."


The band, known for hits such as "Brown Sugar" and "Paint It,
Black", is looking forward to getting out on the road again,
Jagger said.


"We're very happy to do this tour in Europe. It's going to be a
lot of fun," he added.


The Stones suffered a health scare last year after guitarist
Keith Richards fell out of a coconut tree while on holiday in
Fiji.


And Jagger joked that he would make sure there were no more
similar accidents during the tour: "I'll nail him to the nearest
room. I don't think he will be climbing any palm trees."


Members of the Rolling Stones' fan club can buy tickets for some
dates from March 23, although dates vary depending on venue.


The earliest the public can buy tickets for any of the dates is
March 27, although again, dates vary by venue.
