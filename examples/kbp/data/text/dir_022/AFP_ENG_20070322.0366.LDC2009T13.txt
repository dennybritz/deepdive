Middlesbrough defender Jonathan Woodgate has been ruled out of
England's Euro 2008 qualifier in Israel on Saturday because of a
knee injury.


He will not travel to Tel Aviv but will continue his treatment in
England and could be available for the next Group E match against
Andorra on Wednesday.


Woodgate made his long-awaited return to the international stage
in the friendly defeat against Spain at Old Trafford last month.
