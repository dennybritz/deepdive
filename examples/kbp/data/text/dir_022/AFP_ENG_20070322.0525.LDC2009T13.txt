Out-of-favour defender Jean-Louis Montero said on Thursday he had
sued Troyes coach Jean-Marc Furlan for defamation.


"This has nothing to do with the fact I'm no longer playing. He
has called my honour into question on numerous occasions,"
Montero said.


"In an artical written on November 28, he (Furlan) said that I
was no longer good enough to play in the first division. I have
played 200 matches in that league," said the 34-year-old Montero,
who has even failed to make the reserve team.


The struggling French club, who are 17th in the league, made it
clear they fully support the coach in the affair.


"As for Jean-Louis Montero, the first professional player to sue
his coach, maybe he will go down in football history, but it's a
really strange way of operating for a professional player with
eleven years under his belt," read a statement from the club.


Troyes sit just one point above the relegation zone with nine
games left until the end of the season.
