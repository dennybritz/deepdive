British Prime Minister Tony Blair ratcheted up the pressure on
Sudan to halt the bloodshed in Darfur Thursday by calling for
tough new United Nations sanctions.


In a letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel whose country
currently holds the rotating European Union presidency Blair said
that "enough is enough".


Blair had been calling for a harder line against Sudan in recent
weeks.


The letter will not be made public but his official spokesman
told reporters: "The president of Sudan (Omar al-Beshir) is
clearly not complying with the agreement he reached earlier this
year.


"Therefore, the prime minister believes it's time for a new,
tough UN resolution which would mean targeted sanctions aimed at
the top 100 members of the Sudanese government and also those who
are supporting them.


"What he hopes is that the UN as a whole will support tougher
action."


Blair is set to discuss the proposals at this weekend's EU summit
in Berlin.


Last week, he called for a "far tougher line" against Sudan.


The United States has already said it will seek a UN resolution
aimed at forcing Khartoum to let a UN-led peacekeeping force into
Darfur, where some 200,000 people have died in the last four
years.


Beshir, who earlier this month backtracked on an agreement to let
20,000 UN-led peacekeepers into the region, accuses the West of
wanting to invade his country and plunder its resources.
