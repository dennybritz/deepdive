Top-tier Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards will
suspend his campaign and may quit the 2008 race after his wife
Elizabeth suffered a recurrence of breast cancer, a report said
Thursday.


Political news website Politico.com quoted an unnamed friend of
the former vice presidential nominee as saying the campaign,
which had Edwards tucked in behind front-runners Hillary Clinton
and Barack Obama, would go on hold.


"At a minimum, he's going to suspend" the campaign, the source
told Politico.


"Nobody knows precisely how serious her recurrence is. It'll be
another couple of days before there's complete clarity."


"You don't shut this machine off completely, but everything will
go on hold," the source was quoted as saying.
