The military junta in power in Mauritania has named by decree the
24 members of a national human rights commission, the country's
information agency said Thursday.


Mohamed Said Ould Hamodi, a former ambassador and journalist,
will head the commission, created in May last year to promote
human rights in the northwest African country.


Several people known for their work in promoting human rights
during the dictatorship of Maaouiya Ould Taya were named to the
panel, as well.


A bloodless coup led by a military junta in August 2005 ended
more than two decades of dictatorship under Taya.


The country is set to hold the second round of its presidential
elections on Sunday as part of its gradual return to civilian
rule.


The human rights commission also includes members from
associations representing journalists, women and children, as
well as union representatives.


It is the first commission of its kind to be created in the
country.


The commission's duties include allowing for consultations
between the government and civil society organisations. It can
also make suggestions on national legislation concerning human
rights.
