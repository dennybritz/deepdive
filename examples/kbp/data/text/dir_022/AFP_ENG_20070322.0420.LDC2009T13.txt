German coach of Spanish club Getafe, Bernd Schuster, will replace
troubled Real Madrid boss Fabio Capello this summer, according to
Spanish sports daily AS on Thursday.


The former Real Madrid midfielder joins a host of top-flight
coaches rumored to replace the under-fire Italian coach Capello
including Chelsea's Jose Mourinho and Liverpool's Rafael Benitez.


However Mourinho and Benitez have recently rubbished the reports
of an exit from their respective clubs.


According to AS, Real president Ramon Calderon have chosen 47
-year-old Schuster to step in as early as July 1.


Capello has waded through troubled waters on and off the pitch
recently, but a string of poor results and unimpressive
performances have left the Spanish giants third in the domestic
league, five points off leaders Barcelona and second-placed
Sevilla.


Capello, who is under contract until 2009, will reportedly
receive one-year's salary in compensation for his exit, reports
AS.


Schuster played in Spain during the 80s and early 90s for
Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.
