Australia captain George Gregan is to follow in the footsteps of
his former New Zealand counterpart Tana Umaga and join French
second division team Toulon.


Scrum-half Gregan, who holds the world record for the most
international caps with 127, has agreed to join the French club
after the World Cup in September and October.


"It's the second biggest sporting transfer in France after Tana
Umaga. I am really proud, it took me a lot of time and patience,
but I managed to sign one of the best scrum-halves in the world
for the whole season," announced Toulon president Mourad
Boudjellal.


The 33-year-old Gregan, who was born in Lusaka, Zambia, won the
World Cup with Australia in 1999 and also the Tri-Nations in 2000
and 2001.


He will join for a full season as Toulon try to repeat the
raoring success they experienced when former All Blacks captain
Umaga joined for several weeks earlier this season.


The club are second in the division, 17 points off leaders Auch
with seven games left and will likely be one of the teams to
contest a semi-final playoff match for promotion into the French
first division next term.
