Three Kenyan military officers Thursday escaped death after their
patrol helicopter crashed into the Indian Ocean, officials said.


The helicopter, based in the coastal Manda Naval base near the
Kenya-Somali border, was patrolling the area when it crashed.
Refugees from lawless Somalia used the area to sneak into the
country by wooden dhows.


"They survived after they managed to swim to the shores before
they were rescued and airlifted to (the port city of) Mombasa for
specialized treatment," said a police official.


Military spokesman Bogita Ongeri confirmed the crash.


"The cause of the accident has not been established," Ongeri told
a local radio station.
