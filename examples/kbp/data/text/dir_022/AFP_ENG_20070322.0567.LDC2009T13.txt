Czech stars Milan Baros and Tomas Rosicky on Thursday asked home
supporters not to sell tickets for this weekend's Euro 2008
qualifier to visiting fans.


The Czech's host group leaders Germany this weekend in a match
that could go a long way to deciding who tops the group at the
end of the campaign.


"I hope the Czech fans don't want to make money and that the
stadium won't be 90 percent German," said Lyon's Baros in an
interview with Sport newspaper.


The Letna stadium where the match will be held only holds 20,000
people and has had its capacity cut to 18,500 for the match, of
which 3,000 places are to be taken up by German fans.


At least 1,000 Germans without tickets are expected to make their
way to Prague and try to buy tickets on the black market.


"I am convinced that Letna will not lose its magicv and that on
Saturday there won't be 9,000 Germans (inside)," added Rosicky,
who plays for Arsenal.


Both players spoke about a previous World Cup qualifier in
November 2005 which the Czech Republic lost 2-0 to the
Netherlands. The number of Dutch fans in the stadium was clearly
far greater than their 3,000 ticket allocation.


Germany are currently top of the qualifying Group D with 10
points, ahead of the Czechs on goal difference.
