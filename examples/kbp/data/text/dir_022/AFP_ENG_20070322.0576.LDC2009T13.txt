European football's governing body (UEFA) have fined French side
Lille and English club Manchester United following the incidents
that marred their Champions League last 16 encounter in February.


Lille were fined 61,734 euros for security violations and
incorrect behaviour by the Lille players, who left the pitch
after Ryan Giggs's quickly-taken free kick took everyone by
surprise and consequently won the game.


United were meanwhile fined 9,256 euros for incorrect behaviour
by the travelling fans including disturbances at the turnstyles.


Tear gas was used by police during the match at Len's Stade
Felix-Bollaert after ticketing problems led to 5,000 supporters
cramming into a stand built for 3,500.


Supporters appeared to be in danger of being crushed against a
10-foot high safety barrier and two fans were lifted over the
barrier while security officials slammed shut a gate which had
been pushed open by United supporters trying to relieve the
pressure.


Television images of the game were used by UEFA during the
investigation along with reports from both clubs and UEFA's
disciplinary committee.


The two clubs have three days to lodge an appeal against the
decision.
