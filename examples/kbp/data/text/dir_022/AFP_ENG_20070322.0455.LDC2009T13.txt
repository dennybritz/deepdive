Top-tier Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards announced
Thursday his wife had suffered a recurrence of cancer but said
his 2008 White House campaign would go on.


"Her cancer is back," Edwards told reporters at a news conference
in North Carolina, adding that the disease was incurable, but
could be treated and the couple were optimistic about the future.


Asked whether he would be forced to suspend his campaign, as
earlier reported, Edwards answered : "No. The campaign goes on.
The campaign goes on strongly," he said.
