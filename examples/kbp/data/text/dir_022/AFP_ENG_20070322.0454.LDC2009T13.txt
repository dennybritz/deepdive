Paceman Billy Stelling returned career-best figures of 3-12 as
the Netherlands bundled out Scotland for 136 in their World Cup
Group A match at Warner Park here on Thursday.


Stelling dismissed Scottish opener Navdeep Poonia with the second
ball of the innings before accounting for Gavin Hamilton (four)
and Dougie Brown off successive deliveries in his fourth as
Scotland failed to recover from early losses.


Glenn Rogers top-scored with 26 which included five boundaries.


Neil McCallum (24) and Colin Smith (19) gave their team's total
some respectability by adding 38 runs for the sixth wicket after
they were reeling at 39-5.


Ryan Watson (16) and John Blain (18 not out) were other notable
scorers.


The Netherlands bowled accurately after their stand-in captain
Jeroen Smits won the toss and elected to field.


The Netherlands regular captain Luuk van Troost dropped himself
because of lack of form after his team's plus-200-run defeats in
the first two matches.


World number South Africa and Australia, who have already
qualified for the next round of Super Eights from the group, meet
each other in a high-profile match here on Saturday.
