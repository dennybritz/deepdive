Actor Russell Crowe is to make his directorial debut with a film
about an underground surfing community in Australia, it was
reported on Thursday.


Movie industry daily Variety reported that the Oscar-winning
"Gladiator" star's first film as a director would be about three
brothers who form a surfer movement in the Sydney suburb of
Maroubra.


The film is based on the documentary "Bra Boys" about brothers
Sunny, Koby and Jai Abberton, which was released in Australia
earlier this month. Crowe narrated the documentary.


The movie sees Crowe team up again with the creative team behind
"A Beautiful Mind" and "Cinderella Man", producer Brian Grazer
and director Ron Howard.


Later this year Crowe will appear in the Ridley Scott directed-
drama "American Gangster" alongside Denzel Washington.
