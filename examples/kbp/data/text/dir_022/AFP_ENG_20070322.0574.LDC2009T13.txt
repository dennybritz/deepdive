The European Commission urged Democratic Republic of Congo
President Joseph Kabila and ex-vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba
to agree a ceasefire after fighting erupted in the capital
Kinshasa Thursday.


EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel "launched an appeal for
calm to the two parties," his spokesman Amadeu Altafaj told AFP,
adding that the EU official had spoken to both men by telephone
on Thursday.


Fighting broke out in Kinshasa for the first time since last
year, with army troops and guards of the former vice president
exchanging fire.


Shots were fired near the home of Bemba, where tension has been
high for several days since the announcement that his military
protection was to be scaled down.


Kabila was inaugurated as president in December following an
election victory over Bemba.


At least two civilians were killed and several more injured in
the fighting, a diplomatic source said.


Belgian officials said a Belgian man was injured in Thursday's
fighting.


Following a request by UN representative in Dr Congo William Lacy
Swing, Michel "made efforts to obtain a ceasefire which would be
based on Jean-Pierre Bemba recalling all his forces in exchange
for dialogue on a security set-up which would be acceptable to
him," said Altafaj.
