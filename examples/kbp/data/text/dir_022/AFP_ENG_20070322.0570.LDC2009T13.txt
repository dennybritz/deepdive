The Kenyan team Thursday implored its countrymen to pray for
victory as it waited for the weekend's world cross country
championships.


Coach John Mwithiga said the 27-member team had prepared well
enough, but a little prayer was essential.


"We are not going because of an individual, we are not going
because of a certain country, but we are going to compete against
the world cross country teams," he said in Nairobi before the
team left for the venue in Mombasa.


"And we are ready to go and do our duty. We are asking the whole
country to pray for us," he said.


Kenya expects tough opposition from Ethiopia, another athletics
giant.


More than 1,000 athletes from a record 66 countries are expected
to compete in the world championships, to be held in the Indian
Ocean city of Mombasa on Saturday.
