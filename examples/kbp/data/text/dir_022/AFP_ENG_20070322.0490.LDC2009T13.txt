Bangladesh confirmed Thursday its first case of bird flu,
prompting mass culling of poultry at a farm outside the capital
Dhaka, officials said.


"The cabinet held a special meeting on Thursday afternoon after
the health ministry confirmed that bird flu was detected at a
poultry farm at Savar," government spokesman Syed Fahim Munaim
said.


The government sent samples from poultry on the farm to the
National Institute of Animal Health in Bangkok, which confirmed
presence of the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus.


Bangladesh is home to hundreds of thousands of poultry farms,
employing more than a million people.


"We've started culling birds at the infected farm and would now
take special measures including restricting movement of birds
within a 10-kilometre radius area to contain the disease," he
said.


The head of the country's interim government, Fakhruddin Ahmed,
chaired the cabinet meeting, which agreed to take a number of
measures to stop spread of the disease in the South Asian
country, home to 144 million people.


The virulent H5N1 bird flu virus has killed at least 169 people
across the world since late 2003 through contact with infected
birds, according to the World Health Organisation.
