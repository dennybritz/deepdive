At least five people were wounded Thursday when gunmen hurled a
grenade into a police post in the port town of Kismayo,
highlighting instability in the country, officials said.


The attack came three days after the Kismayo police commander was
shot dead by his bodyguard in the township, about 500 kilometres
(310 miles) south of the capital Mogadishu.


"Unknown gunmen have thrown a grenade into a police station and
it exploded wounding five people, including civilians," said
Ibrahim Timajili, the district commissioner for Kismayo.


Police confirmed the attack. "Of the wounded, three were
policemen and two civilians," Bille Ali, a police officer, told
AFP by telephone.


"We have not identified who they were, but we are investigating
the attack," he added.


The attack followed two days of heavy fighting between Somali-
Ethiopian forces and suspected Islamist insurgents in Mogadishu,
killing at least 24 people, leaving hundreds of troops wounded
and forcing hundreds to flee.


Kismayo was the last bastion of the Islamist movement, who
controlled much of south and central Somalia, before it was
routed by Somali-Ethiopian troops in January.


Since then, the Islamists have responded with guerrilla attacks
mainly in Mogadishu killing dozens and forcing at least 40,000
others to flee.


The scale of Somalia's violence has defied numerous
internationally-backed peace-making initiatives since the desert
country plunged into lawlessness with the 1991 ouster of dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre.
