US Senators Thursday authorized subpoenas to be issued against
top White House aides, in a second such blow to President George
W. Bush fighting a controversy over purged prosecutors.


The Senate Judiciary Affairs Committee followed a similiar move
in the House on Wednesday by allowing its chairman, Patrick
Leahy, to issue the subpoenas in its probe into whether eight
prosecutors were sacked for political reasons.


Bush, already under fire in the Democratic-controlled Congress
for the war in Iraq, has vowed to fight any subpoenas, setting up
a potential constitutional crisis.
