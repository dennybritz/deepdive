The 2006 Giro D'Italia winner Ivan Basso has been ruled out of
Saturday's Milan- San Remo classic cycling race, the Gazzetta
dello Sport's website reported on Thursday.


The 29-year-old, who rides for the Discovery Channel team, is
still feeling pain from a sprained left wrist which he suffered
in a fall last Friday in the Tirreno-Adriatico one-week stage
race.


Despite the injury, Basso started Saturday's stage but withdrew
before the end as the pain became unbearable.


On Wednesday Basso's Italian compatriot Danilo Di Luca, a former
Pro Tour series winner, pulled out of the Milan-San Remo as he is
still feeling weak after a heavy bout of flu.
