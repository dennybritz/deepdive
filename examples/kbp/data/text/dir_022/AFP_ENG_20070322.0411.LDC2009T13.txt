The price of gold climbed on Thursday to the highest level since
the start of this month, lifted by a weakening US dollar and firm
crude oil prices, analysts said.


Gold prices hit as high as 666.92 dollars on the London Bullion
Market, reaching a level which was last seen on March 1, 2006.


"Gold prices continued to strengthen ... driven by the weaker
dollar  following the FOMC announcement and further buoyed by the
firmer oil prices," said Barclays Capital analyst Sudakshina
Unnikrishnan.


The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25
percent on Wednesday, but tweaked its policy statement in what
some saw as signalling a possible interest rate cut later this
year, analysts said.


The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) dropped a reference to
"firming" or hiking rates, substituting the phrase "future policy
adjustments" that would depend on economic data.


The statement helped propel the euro to a two-year high above
1.34 dollars overnight.


A weak US dollar makes gold cheaper for buyers using other
currencies.


The precious metal is also benefiting from higher oil prices,
which increase the risk of inflation. That increases the
attractiveness of gold as a defence against the erosion of the
value of money.


World oil prices continued climbing on Thursday, with New York
crude above 60 dollars per barrel after news of a larger-than-
expected fall in US gasoline stockpiles, traders said.
