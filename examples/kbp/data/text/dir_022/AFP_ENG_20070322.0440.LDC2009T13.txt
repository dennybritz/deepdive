Nearly one million Russian tourists visited Egypt last year,
second only to the number of British visitors, Egypt's deputy
tourism minister, Ahmed El-Khadem, said here Thursday.


El-Khadem said 998,000 Russian tourists visited Egypt in 2006,
spending 830 million dollars (621 million euros), the spokesman
for the Egyptian embassy in Moscow, Hassan El-Hemaly, told AFP.


The number of Russian tourists to Egypt has tripled since 2002
and the first two months of this year saw a 40-percent increase
in visits from Russians over the same months last year, he said.


A record 9.81 million tourists added 7.6 billion dollars (5.7
million euros) to Egypt's economy last year, Tourism Minister
Zoheir Garranha told AFP in January.
