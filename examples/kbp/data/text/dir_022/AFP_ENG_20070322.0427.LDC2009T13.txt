American software billionaire Charles Simonyi will be packing a
piece of Communist-era computer gadgetry for his launch into
space on a Russian rocket next month, he said during training
Thursday.


Simonyi, one of the brains behind Microsoft's rise, will become
the world's fifth space tourist when he joins the mission to the
International Space Station (ISS) on April 7.


He has paid about 25 million dollars (18.7 million euros) for the
trip, organiser Eric Anderson of Space Adventures said earlier.


Simonyi, 58, said he had become fascinated by computers while
growing up in then Communist-ruled Hungary.


"I'm taking a computer tape for a Russian Ural II computer that I
was programming in 1964," he said at a press conference at Star
City, the training centre for cosmonauts in a forest east of
Moscow.


He wrote the program on the tape when he was only 16 and an
intern at Hungary's bureau of national statistics, he explained.


"I still keep the paper tape in my safe and am taking one with me
to remind me of where it all began," Simonyi told AFP later.


Leaving Hungary at 17, Simonyi was to become the main designer of
the Word and Excel programs, before leaving Microsoft in 2002 to
found his own company, Intentional Software.


He will work on a series of experiments in space, including
taking samples of biological contamination on the ISS.
