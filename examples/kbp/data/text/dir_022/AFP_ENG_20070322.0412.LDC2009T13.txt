A Florida toddler was found to be high on cocaine, and local
police are trying to find out just how that happened,
Jacksonville's Time-Union newspaper reported on Thursday.


The toddler was unsteady on her feet and wouldn't eat, so her
parents took her to Jacksonville Hospital, where doctors made
their stunning diagnosis.


The police report put the girl's age as between 18 and 24 months.


The parents took the little girl to be checked by doctors after
an employee at the Baptist church pre-school she attended said
the child was acting in an unusual manner.


The toddler's parents said their daughter had been fine when she
was dropped off at the pre-school center, the daily reported.


The parents and employees of the center all tested negative for
cocaine, the paper said.
