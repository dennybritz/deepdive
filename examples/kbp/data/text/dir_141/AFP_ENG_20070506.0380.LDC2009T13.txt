Polls closed in Burkina Faso on Sunday following voting in
legislative elections expected to reinforce the governing party's
grip on power, the national electoral commission announced.


Voting stations closed as expected at 6:00 pm (1800 GMT). Moussa
Michel Tapsoba, electoral commission president, said on national
radio that those who were still in line at that time would be
allowed to vote.


The election in Africa's fourth most poverty-stricken country was
considered a litmus test for President Blaise Compaore's ruling
Congress for Democracy and Progress, which took 57 seats in the
2002 vote, a huge reduction from its previous huge 104-seat
majority.


Complete preliminary results were not expected before Saturday.
