Celtic midfielder Neil Lennon is confident that he will be
playing Premiership football next season following his decision
to quit the Scottish champions at the end of this campaign.


Although he has already turned 35, the former Northern Ireland
international believes he can still be competitive in the English
top flight and he could be set to link-up again with former
Celtic team-mate Roy Keane at newly-promoted Sunderland.


"I fancy a fresh start somewhere for a year or two. I think I'll
play in the Premiership," Lennon said after his final Old Firm
game ended in a 2-1 defeat by Rangers.


"I have no worries about my fitness or state of mind as I've
played more than 40 games again. I played in the Premiership for
four or five years before I moved to Celtic. The quality hasn't
improved that much in England since then.    "If a Premiership
club wants me, I don't see why not. I'll see what suits me."


Lennon is a firm favourite of the Hoops fans but the goldfish
bowl nature of life as an Old Firm footballer in the west of
Scotland means he does not harbour ambitions to return to
Parkhead one day as manager.


"I've had enough as a player and I'm not sure I could put myself
through the ringer again as a manager."
