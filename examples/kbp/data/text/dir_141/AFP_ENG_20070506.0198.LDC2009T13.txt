German football icon Franz Beckenbauer was told on Sunday to
cease criticising the management of fallen German champions
Bayern Munich by the club president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.


Beckenbauer, a World Cup winner both as a player and a manager
with the then West Germany, is president of the surveillance
council for Bayern but has made some heavy hitting remarks aimed
at Rummenigge and general manager Uli Hoeness of late as Bayern
lost all hope of retaining the title.


However on Sunday Rummenigge hit back.


"His (Beckenbauer's) criticisms don't only irritate me but also
the financial directors and administrators of the club,"
Rummenigge told Die Welt.


Beckenbauer, known as the 'Kaiser' and who was roundly applauded
for his presidency of the World Cup organising committee last
year, has attacked the manner in which the management team did
not replace German captain Michael Ballack, who left on a free
transfer for Chelsea last summer, or the dressing room rift with
former coach Felix Magath, who was sacked in January.


Bayern are having their worst season for 10 years, with no
trophies and struggling to even make the top three in the league
which would see them miss out on a Champions League place.
