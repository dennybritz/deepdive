A landmine detonated by Tamil Tigers killed three police
commandos in eastern Sri Lanka on Sunday while seven suspected
rebels died elsewhere in the embattled region, the defence
ministry said.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) attack blew up a
police Special Task Force vehicle in Batticaloa district killing
three officers and wounding three more, the ministry said in a
statement.


Security forces shot five rebels in the north of the island early
Sunday while two more were killed in Batticaloa, the statement
said.


It said the guerrillas fired mortars across their front line in
Vavuniya, in the north of the island Sunday, injuring several
soldiers.


Security forces retaliated, but there were no immediate reports
of rebel casualties. There was also no word from the Tigers about
the latest reports of fighting.


The renewed violence came after the Sri Lankan navy said it
killed at least a dozen rebels in a battle off the northeast
coast on Friday night.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,800 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005.
