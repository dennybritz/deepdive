EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot congratulated Nicolas
Sarkozy Sunday on his presidential election victory as well as
French voters for turning out in such great number.


"I address to the new President of the Republic my warmest
congratulations," Barrot, a Frenchman, said in a statement in
Brussels.


"I would like, under his impetus, for France to find a new
dynamism and undertake the reforms that are a condition for
success," he said.


"France has great responsibility in Europe. From the renewal of
its institutions, to be addressed at the next European Council
(summit) June 21 and 22, to the great projects of the future like
energy, research, defence and diplomacy, the voice of France is
awaited," he said.


Barrot said the elections had also "proven the vitality of French
democracy through a record turnout, and the rejection of
extremism."


Right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy scored an emphatic victory,
with around 53 percent of the vote, according to early
projections, compared to 47 percent for his Socialist rival
Segolene Royal.


By late afternoon, some 75.11 percent of France's 44.5 million
eligible voters had cast ballots to choose a successor to
President Jacques Chirac, the highest turnout since the 1965
election won by Charles de Gaulle.
