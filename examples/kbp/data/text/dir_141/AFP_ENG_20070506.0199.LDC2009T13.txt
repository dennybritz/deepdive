Gunmen shot dead two Shiite clerics in suspected sectarian
violence in a central Pakistani town overnight, police said
Sunday.


The attackers, believed to be Sunni militants, sprayed bullets at
the clerics who were sleeping in the guest house of a Shiite
leader in the town of Chubara, local police chief Rai Muhammad
Tahir said.


The clerics, who were visiting Chubara, 150 kilometres (90 miles)
northwest of Multan, died on the spot while another guest, a
Shiite lawyer, was injured, he said. The attackers fled in a car.


"It might be a sectarian attack because the slain men were
visiting the town to collect donations to build a Shiite madrassa
(seminary) in the area," he told reporters.


"We are investigating the case," he said adding that no one had
been arrested so far.


The killings came hours after two masked men gunned down a Shiite
Muslim near the northwestern town of Dera Ismail Khan on
Saturday.


Sajid Naqvi, chief of a Shiite political party, condemned the
killings saying that "it shows the government has failed to
protect the lives and property of the Shiite community."


Sectarian violence involving militants from Sunni and Shiite
communities has claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late
1980s.


Shiites form about 20 percent of Pakistan's 160 million Sunni-
dominated population.
