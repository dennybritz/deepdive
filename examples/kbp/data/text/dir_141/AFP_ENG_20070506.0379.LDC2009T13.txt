A man dressed in Afghan army uniform shot dead two US soldiers
Sunday outside Afghanistan's main, high security prison near the
capital Kabul, the US-led coalition said.


"He fired shots into a vehicle being driven by US service
personnel as they were leaving the prison. This action resulted
in the death of two soldiers and left two other soldiers
wounded," spokesman Major Sheldon Smith told AFP.
