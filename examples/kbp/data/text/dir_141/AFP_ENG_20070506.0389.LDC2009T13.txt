French President Jacques Chirac on Sunday telephoned Nicolas
Sarkozy to congratulate him on his presidential election win and
wish him success, the Elysee palace said.


"The president of the republic called Nicolas Sarkozy to
congratulate him and express his wishes for the success of his
mission in the service of the women and men of France," said the
presidency.


Sarkozy, the candidate of the ruling Union for a Popular Movement
(UMP) who defeated his socialist rival Segolene Royal by 53 to 47
percent, is to take over from Chirac on May 16.
