An Israeli civilian was moderately wounded on Sunday after
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip fired a rocket at the southern
town of Sderot, medical and army sources said.


A medical team was treating the man for moderate shrapnel wounds,
the sources said.


An army spokesman said this was the fifth projectile fired from
the Palestinian territory on Sunday.
