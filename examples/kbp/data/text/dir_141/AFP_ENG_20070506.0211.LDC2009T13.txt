Belarus said on Sunday that a woman kidnapped by unknown gunmen
in southern Nigeria was a Belarussian national rather than a
Russian as claimed by local police.


The woman, abducted on Saturday in the oil capital Port Harcourt,
"was listed as a citizen of Belarus" in consular records, a
spokesman for Belarus' foreign ministry told AFP.


"We have received such information and the consular department of
the foreign ministry is making enquiries to determine this
citizen's situation," the spokesman said.


He identified the woman by her first name, Irina.


Police in Port Harcourt earlier said the woman was a Russian
working for a catering company.


Twenty-eight foreigners have been kidnapped in oil-rich southern
Nigeria in the past week alone, although eight were released
within hours.


Militant groups in the region do not normally kidnap women
however.
