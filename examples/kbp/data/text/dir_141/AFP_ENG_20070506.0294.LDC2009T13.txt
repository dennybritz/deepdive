More than 30 cars were set on fire in Paris during the night
preceding Sunday's presidential election, police said.


The figure of 34 was slightly higher than on the eve of the first
round of the vote on April 22, they said.


In addition unknown vandals overnight plugged the locks of
several voting stations with glue.
