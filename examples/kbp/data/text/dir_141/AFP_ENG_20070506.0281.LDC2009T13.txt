Actress Helen Mirren, who won an Oscar for her film portrayal of
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, has turned down an invitation for
dinner at Buckingham Palace, the Mail on Sunday newspaper
reported.


Mirren, star of "The Queen", declined the monarch's rare invite
because she was busy filming her new movie, "National Treasure:
Book of Secrets", in the United States, the paper said.


"It is unheard of for her majesty to extend a personal invitation
to dinner to someone who has portrayed her in a film," it quoted
a senior palace official as saying.


"We did not expect to be told that the date is unacceptable."


Mirren told the paper that she was invited to dinner at the
palace on May 1 but could not attend because she was filming and
could not change her schedule.


In her Oscar acceptance speech after being named best actress in
February, Mirren paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth, 80, as a woman
who for half a century "has maintained her dignity, her sense of
duty, and her hairstyle."


"I salute her courage and her consistency. And I thank her,
because if it wasn't for her, I most certainly would not be
here," she said, hoisting her Oscar aloft and adding: "Ladies and
gentlemen, I give you the queen!"
