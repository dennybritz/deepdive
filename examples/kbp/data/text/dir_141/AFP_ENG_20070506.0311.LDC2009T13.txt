Manchester United regained the English Premiership title on
Sunday after closest rivals Chelsea were held 1-1 by Arsenal.


With two matches to play United, who last won the title four
years ago, hold a seven-point advantage over Chelsea, who have
won it for the past two seasons.


United had beaten Manchester City 1-0 on Saturday thanks to a
Cristiano Ronaldo penalty - his 23rd goal of the season - and
Chelsea were up against it when they went 1-0 down and lost
Khalid Bouhlarouz - who was sent-off - in the first-half.


Michael Essien levelled for the Blues in the second-half but they
were unable to get the winner that would have kept the title race
alive giving them their second disappointment of the week after
Liverpool knocked them out of the Champions League last Tuesday.
