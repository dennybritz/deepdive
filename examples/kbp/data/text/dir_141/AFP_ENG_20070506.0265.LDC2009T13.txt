The sole candidate in Turkey's presidential election, Foreign
Minister Abdullah Gul, officially withdrew his name Sunday after
parliament failed for a second time to vote him into office.


"As things stand now, I am withdrawing my candidacy for the
presidential election," Gul said. "Given the situation, a second-
round vote makes no sense."
