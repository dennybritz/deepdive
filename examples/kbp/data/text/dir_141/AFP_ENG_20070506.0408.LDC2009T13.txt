President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy said Sunday that the United
States can count on friendship from France but urged Washington
to show leadership in the struggle against global warming.


Sarkozy, who won Sunday's presidential election to succeed
Jacques Chirac, said "a great nation like the United States has
the duty to not create obstacles in the struggle against global
warming."


"Quite the contrary, it should take the lead in this battle
because what is at stake is all of humanity," said the
rightwinger, who won 53 percent of the vote, according to
projections.


"France will make this battle it's first battle," he said.


The Republican administration of US President George W. Bush has
refused to adopt the Kyoto treaty against climate change, arguing
the economic costs would be crippling and the science remained
unclear.


Bush had telephoned Sarkozy to congratulate him, a White House
spokesman said.


"The United States and France are historic allies and partners.
President Bush looks forward to working with President-elect
Sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance,"  said Gordon
Johndroe, spokesman for the White House National Security
Council.
