Pop stars Beyonce and Shakira hung on to the top spot in the
British singles charts Sunday, despite a massive jump in the
rankings for Indie rock group the Manic Street Preachers.


It marked the third consecutive week the duo's song "Beautiful
Liar" topped the singles charts.


The Manic Street Preachers gave them a run for their money,
though, surging 25 places to rise to the second spot in the
charts with their song "Your Love Alone Is Not Enough."


Their singles chart success comes ahead of the launch of their
eighth album "Send Away The Tigers," which goes on sale Monday.


Rounding out the top five were "Cupid's Chokehold" by Gym Class
Heroes, "Give It To Me" by Timbaland, Nelly Furtado and Justin
Timberlake, and "Girlfriend" by Avril Lavigne.


Arctic Monkeys topped the album charts with "Favourite Worst
Nightmare."
