US President George W. Bush telephoned France's new president-
elect Nicolas Sarkozy to congratulate him on his victory in
Sunday's presidential election, a White House spokesman said.


"President Bush called president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy to
congratulate him on his victory," said Gordon Johndroe, spokesman
for the White House National Security Council.


"The United States and France are historic allies and partners.
President Bush looks forward to working with president-elect
Sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance."


Sarkozy celebrated victory in the second round of voting after
projections gave him victory with 53 percent of the vote and his
Socialist rival Segolene Royal conceded defeat with 47 percent.


Following news of his victory, he said that the United States can
count on a friendship with France, which "will always be at their
side when they need help."


Since a much-publicized US trip in September 2006, Sarkozy has
fought against charges that he pandered to Bush and the
perception that he is too pro-American, a quality seen as
unpopular with French voters.


But he has also made emphatic calls for friendship between the
two nations.


Franco-American relations cooled in 2003 when Paris, under its
now outgoing president Jacques Chirac, took a leading role in the
United Nations in opposition to Washington's plans to invade
Iraq.


But ahead of the election, France's ambassador to the United
States dismissed the notion that relations between the two
countries were still chilly.
