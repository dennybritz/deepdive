Sunderland will return to the Premiership as winners of the
Championship after Roy Keane's side completed a remarkable season
with a 5-0 win over Luton on Sunday.


The win allowed Sunderland to leapfrog Steve Bruce's Birmingham,
who had to settle for the second automatic promotion slot after
being beaten 1-0 at Preston.


That win was not enough to earn Preston a place in the play-offs
as all four teams above them won their final matches.


Third-placed Derby will take on sixth-placed Southampton while
West Brom will play Wolves in the play-offs semi-finals.


The winners of those two matches then face each other for the
right to join Sunderland and Birmingham in the Premiership.
