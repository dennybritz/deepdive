Rescue teams in Cameroon believe they have found the wreckage of
a Kenyan Airways plane carrying 114 people and missing for more
than 36 hours, a Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority official said
Sunday.


"Rescue teams that were coming back from a search mission spotted
something that appeared like the Kenya Airways wreckage and they
informed the other rescuers in Douala who have sent a ground team
to confirm at the site," the official said, asking not to be
named.


He said an air resuce team spotted the wreck among mangroves near
the sea 10 kilometres (six miles) north of Douala, from where the
plane departed.


"The team should arrive there in 30 minutes and give us the final
confirmation," he said.


The Boeing 737-800, which began its journey in the Ivory Coast
city of Abidjan, took off from Douala airport in western Cameroon
in a violent storm after midnight Friday, headed for Nairobi.


The plane was carrying 105 passengers from at least 23 countries
and nine Kenyan crew, and sent out a distress signal shortly
after taking off.
