Spain's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano won the truncated Italian Open
here Sunday, beating Austria's Markus Brier in the second hole of
a play-off.


The pair had tied at 16-under par for a total of 200 in an event
that was reduced to three rounds after rain all but wiped out
Friday's programme.


But while Fernandez-Castano celebrated his third Tour success
there was heartache for England's Nick Dougherty.


Three clear with nine holes to go the 24-year-old from Liverpool
threw away his chance when bogeying the 12th and 17th to lose by
one shot.


Fernandez-Castano in contrast stormed home in 30 after being six
shots behind at the turn to add this to his wins in the 2005
Dutch Open and last season's Asian Open.


Doughtery finished in a tie for third with Swedish duo Henrik
Nystrom and Fredrik Andersson Hed and defending champion
Francesco Molinari. Last year's American Ryder Cup captain Tom
Lehman finished on eight under.
