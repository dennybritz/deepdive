The Seattle Mariners suspended pitcher Julio Mateo for 10 days on
Sunday, a day after he was reportedly arrested for assaulting his
wife in a New York hotel.


Mateo, 29, was penalized for missing Saturday's game against the
New York Yankees without permission from the team.


According to a report by the Seattle Times, Mateo was charged
with third-degree assault after turning himself into police.


His wife, Aurea, needed five stitches for a bite mark on her lip
following an incident that took place around 2:30 a.m. Saturday
morning, the newspaper stated.


Following the Mariners' 8-1 loss on Saturday, the righthander was
optioned to minor league Class AAA Tacoma, and pitcher Sean Green
was recalled to fill the roster spot on Sunday.
