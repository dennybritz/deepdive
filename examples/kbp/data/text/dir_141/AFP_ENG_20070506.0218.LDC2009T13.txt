Three Palestinian children and an Israeli armed guard were
wounded in separate shooting incidents on Sunday in the occupied
West Bank, officials said.


In the northern town of Jenin three children, all under 14, were
wounded by Israeli fire as they threw stones at soldiers carrying
out an operation at a house of an Islamic Jihad militant,
Palestinian security sources said.


An army spokeswoman said that troops had used rubber bullets to
disperse a crowd that had gathered in the area.


Separately, an Israeli armed guard was seriously wounded when
gunmen opened fire at a truck near the Palestinian town of
Ramallah, Israeli medical sources said.


The man, a civilian guard who was escorting the truck, was rushed
to a hospital inside Israel, a Magen David Adom medical services
spokesman told AFP.


Israeli soldiers were searching for the gunmen, the army said.


The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a militant group loosely affiliated
with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, claimed
responsibility for the shooting.
