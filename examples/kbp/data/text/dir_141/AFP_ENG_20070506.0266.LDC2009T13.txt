Turnout in the French presidential election on Sunday reached
more than 75 percent by late afternoon Sunday, the highest
participation since the 1965 election, officials said.


Voters were choosing a successor to Jacques Chirac, with
rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy the clear favourite to triumph over
Socialist Segolene Royal.


By 5:00 pm (1500 GMT), 75.11 percent of France's 44.5 million
registered voters had turned up at the polls, up from 73.87
percent in the April 22 first round and from 67.6 percent in the
2002 election, said the interior ministry.


It was the highest turnout registered at that point since the
1965 election that was won by Charles de Gaulle.


Overall turnout for the multi-candidate first round of voting on
April 22 reached 83.77 percent, the highest since 1974.
