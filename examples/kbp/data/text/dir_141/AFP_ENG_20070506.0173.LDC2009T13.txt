A former Jordanian deputy known for his run-ins with the
authorities has been jailed following a complaint by Interior
Minister Eid al-Fayez, a judicial source told AFP on Sunday.


Ahmad Abbadi was arrested on Thursday and jailed on charges of
"defamation," "undermining the prestige and reputation of the
state" and "violation of Internet laws," the source said.


The authorities have denied him bail so far, the source added.


He was arrested after publishing on the Internet a letter he
wrote to US Senate Majority leader Harry Reid in which he
described the regime of King Abdullah II as corrupt, according to
a copy of the letter seen by AFP.


He also made allegations of human rights and media violations in
Jordan.


Abbadi, who last served in parliament from 1997 to 2001, was
arrested in May 2001 after biting the ear of a fellow MP in a
brawl sparked by a dispute between two families after a girl was
harassed by youths from Abbadi's clan.
