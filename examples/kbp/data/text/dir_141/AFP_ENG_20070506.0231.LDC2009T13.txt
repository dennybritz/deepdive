At least 12 people, including two paramilitary personnel, were
wounded Sunday in an explosion at a marketplace in India's
restive northeastern Assam state, police said.


The blast took place near a temple in the busy Fancy Bazar area
in Assam's main city of Guwahati during evening shopping hours,
Rajen Singh, police chief of Guwahati city, told AFP.


"The bomb was on a parked motorcycle. The victims were either
evening shoppers or vendors," Singh said.


"Two of the injured were paramilitary troopers ... on a routine
patrol in the area," Singh said, blaming the explosion on the
outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), a rebel group
fighting for an independent homeland since 1979.


The blast was the third in Assam in the past four days. Eight
people were injured Friday in a car bomb explosion in eastern
Assam, while two were wounded in a blast at a Guwahati warehouse
on Thursday.


The ULFA has been blamed for a string of attacks in January that
killed 80 people in eastern Assam.


An Indian home ministry report released earlier this week said 99
civilians had been killed in ULFA attacks in the three months to
March 31.


New Delhi has launched a massive military offensive against the
ULFA and the Indian army has said it has killed 55 rebels and
arrested 553 more since January.


More than 10,000 lives have been lost due to unrest in Assam in
the past two decades.
