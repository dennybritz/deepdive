Some 500 German police broke up a concert gathering of 150
skinhead right-wing extremists in the small hours of Sunday in
Neufeld, a village in the north of the country, police said.


The skinheads dispersed without offering any resistance and no
arrests were made.


The police intervention was prompted by suspicions that the
skinheads were planning to distribute neo-Nazi material,
including CDs, which is a punishable offence in Germany.


According to NDR radio station, Neufeld is known for regularly
hosting meetings of the "Blood and Honour" skinhead movement.
