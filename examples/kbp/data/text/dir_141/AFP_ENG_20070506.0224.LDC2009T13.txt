The French Defence Ministry said Sunday that eight French
soldiers and one Canadian had died when a small plane of the
Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) peacekeeping mission
crashed in Egypt's northern Sinai region.


The death toll confirmed one given earlier by Egyptian
authorities.


"The nine military personnel on board, eight French and one
Canadian, all died in this tragic accident," the ministry said in
a statement.


Witnesses in the area told AFP and Egyptian public television
that the plane smashed into a truck as it was attempting an
emergency landing before crashing into the side of a mountain.


The MFO is an independent peacekeeping force not related to the
United Nations, created as a result of the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty and funded mainly by the two neighbours and the
United States.
