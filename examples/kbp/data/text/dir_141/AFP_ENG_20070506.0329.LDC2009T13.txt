The Canadian embassy in Saudi Arabia on Sunday protested a
decision to shut down its booth at an education fair because it
was staffed by women.


"Such unprofessional incidents are very damaging to Saudi
Arabia's international reputation," the embassy said in a
statement following the closure at the 12th Middle East education
fair in the Red Sea city of Jeddah.


"Prior to the event, we specifically inquired whether women staff
would be permitted at the exhibition and we were told by the
organisers, the Al-Harithy Company, that they would," it added.


The booth was closed because there were two women amongst the
staff, an embassy official told AFP, requesting anonymity.


He said that the kingdom's notorious religious police were behind
the move to shut the booth, which hosted several Canadian
universities that had paid fees to participate in the exhibition
targeting Saudi students.


"The exhibition was a mixed event for families ... making the
closing of the booth due to the presence of women staff members
even more incomprehensible," the statement added.


Expected to cover from head-to-toe in public, women are not
allowed to work in mixed environments in the ultra-conservative
kingdom where only men work as salespersons.
