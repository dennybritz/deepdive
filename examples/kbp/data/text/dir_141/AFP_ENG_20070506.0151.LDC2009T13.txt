South Korea on Sunday urged the Asian Development Bank to
consider investing in its impoverished northern neighbour as
Pyongyang moves slowly towards denuclearisation.


South Korean Finance Minister Kwon O Kyu told the ADB's annual
meeting that North Korea was one of the world's poorest nations
and was gradually returning from international diplomatic
isolation.


"I suggest that ADB gear itself up to supporting the reform
efforts of potential future clients like the DPRK, when
conditions mature," he said, using the North's official name.


"Conversely, inaction on the DPRK's isolation and poverty will
only increase the risk that this reclusive country can pose to
the world economy," he said.


Under a landmark February 13 disarmament-for-aid agreement, North
Korea pledged to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor and allow
in UN inspectors by April 14.


But the deadline slipped, with North Korea refusing to act until
it receives 25 million dollars frozen at a Macau bank since 2005
over US allegations of money laundering and counterfeiting.
