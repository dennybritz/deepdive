Australia's Qantas said Sunday it considered an 11.1 billion
dollar (9.2 billion US) bid to take over the airline to be dead,
even though regulators have yet to decide on a final appeal.


The airline's board, which strongly recommended the offer by
private equity group Airline Partners Australia to shareholders,
said it would begin looking at fresh strategies for Qantas's
future after the deal collapsed in chaos.


"On 4 May, Airline Partners Australia (APA) announced that it did
not receive acceptances representing at least 50 percent of
Qantas shares by the 7.00 pm deadline and therefore the APA offer
could not proceed.


"While APA has made several regulatory applications over the
weekend, the Qantas Board considers that the current bid has
failed," the airline said in a statement.


"Accordingly, Qantas will proceed with strategies and plans for
its future. The Board thanks management and staff who have
carried on normal operations so well while the APA Offer was
being considered by shareholders," it added.


The statement acknowledging that the bid had failed came hours
after APA appealed a decision earlier Sunday by the Takeovers
Panel to refuse to recognise late shareholder support that would
have saved the deal.


The panel ruled that backing from a major American investor,
which came in after the passage of Friday night's 7:00 pm
deadline but would have pushed shareholder support for the deal
to 50.6 percent, would not be counted.
