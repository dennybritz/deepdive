A British policeman was shot dead while at the scene of a
"domestic-related incident" in a western English town on Sunday
morning, local police said.


He was shot in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, at about 6:10 a.m. (0510
GMT), and pronounced dead a short while later at Royal Shrewsbury
Hospital.


Also found dead at the scene was an unidentified man in his 30s,
and a firearm was recovered, police said. No one else was
injured.


"The thoughts of everyone are with the family of our officer and
others affected by this incident at this desperately sad time,"
said West Mercia police Chief Constable Paul West.


"A thorough investigation into all the circumstances surrounding
this incident will be carried out in close consultation with the
IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission)."


West said at a Sunday evening press conference that he was unable
to name the officer because there were still members of his
family who had not yet been informed.


He did, however, pay tribute to "the enormous dedication and
bravery of all police officers who day in, day out put themselves
at risk to respond to calls for assistance."


He added that the entire police force was "extremely shocked and
saddened" by the death.


Outgoing interior minister John Reid told the BBC on Sunday that
"day in and day out I know from personal experience the risk to
life and limb that is taken by those who serve in our police
service."
