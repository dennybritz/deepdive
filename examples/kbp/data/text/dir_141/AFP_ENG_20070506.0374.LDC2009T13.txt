Jean-Louis Borloo, tipped as a possible prime minister under a
Nicolas Sarkozy presidency, Sunday hailed the right-winger's
election victory over Segolene Royal as "beautiful because it was
unambiguous".


Sarkozy scored a decisive 53 to 47 percent victory over Royal,
according to projections from polling firms, after promising a
"clean break" from the policies of the past, and a radical new
agenda of tax cuts and work incentives.


Borloo, 56, the current minister of employment and social
cohesion is seen as a popular politician with a strong record of
help for the disadvantaged and has been tipped as a possible head
of government.
