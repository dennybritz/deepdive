Eritrea launched a crackdown on unregistered religious worship,
including the arrest of 80 church members in the capital Asmara,
opposition groups said Sunday.


The arrests took place in a raid on the Mehrete Yesus Evangelical
Presbyterian Church during a service a week ago, according to a
report on the website of Release Eritrea, a Britain-based
opposition group.


Two US citizens were also arrested and then released four days
later, the group said.


Several other religious freedom news websites also published
reports of the crackdown.


Eritrean Information Minister Ali Abdu did not deny the reports
but refused to comment.


"We will not respond everyday to every such press statement," Ali
told AFP by telephone.


Religion is a particularly sensitive subject in Eritrea, where
the government wants national unity among its 4.2 million people,
officially split equally between Islam and Christianity.


The government officially recognizes four religious
denominations: Islam, Orthodox, Catholic and the Eritrean
Evangelical Church.


Under a decree issued in May 2002, other groups are permitted to
worship but must first register with authorities in Asmara.


Human rights groups and the United States regularly accuse the
Eritrean authorities of religious persecution, particularly
against unregistered evangelical Christian congregations.
