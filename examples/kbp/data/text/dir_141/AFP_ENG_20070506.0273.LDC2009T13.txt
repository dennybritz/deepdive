A large fire broke out on Sunday at a construction site on a
giant artificial palm-shaped island off the coast of the booming
emirate of Dubai.


Smoke billowed over buildings along the trunk of the Palm
Jumeirah Island and was visible from far away, while fire engines
rushed to cross the bridge linking the island to the mainland.


An engineer who worked on the site told AFP that the fire erupted
in the basement of a nine-storey-building and created a "pretty
toxic smell".


He said that construction was at the stage of "primary ducting
and piping".


A statement issued later by Nakeel, the company developing the
island, said the fire commenced "within the building igniting
building materials and causing substantive smoke."


It said that one worker was taken to hospital for smoke
inhalation, and that the contractor working on the building which
is owned by a third party has confirmed that all workers have
been accounted for.


Palm Jumeirah is one of three large man-made islands being
constructed off the coast of Dubai. Property owners have already
moved into some of the buildings.


In January, two Asian workers were killed and 57 others wounded
in a similar fire which erupted in an under-construction tower in
Dubai. Similar accidents have prompted the police to impose
strict safety regulations on construction sites.


Dubai, a member of the seven-strong United Arab Emirates, is in
the midst of a drive to establish itself as the Gulf's business
and leisure hub.
