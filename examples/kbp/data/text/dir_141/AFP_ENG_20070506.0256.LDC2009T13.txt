Kosovo's prime minister said on Sunday that he hoped the Serbian
province would gain independence in a matter of weeks, while
ruling out a future union with neighbouring Albania.


"I sincerely hope that Kosovo will be independent very soon,"
Agim Ceku told Croatian national television HRT, adding that it
could come in a few weeks.


As for the possibility of forming a union with Albania, Ceku said
Kosovo was more interested in European Union membership.


"There is only one plan for a union -- with the European Union,"
he said.


A plan developed by UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari to provide
internationally supervised independence for Kosovo is expected to
be taken up soon at the UN Security Council.


Serbia and Russia have steadfastly opposed the move, while the
United States and the European Union have supported it.


Moscow has threatened to wield its veto at the Security Council
to block the plan, while Serbia has proposed "monitored autonomy"
instead of independence for the province.


Ceku is to attend a summit of leaders from southeastern European
countries in Zagreb on Thursday and Friday. Serbian Prime
Minister Vojislav Kostunica is also scheduled to attend.


Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since 1999,
when a NATO bombing campaign ended a crackdown by Belgrade forces
on independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
