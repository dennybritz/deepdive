A grenade wounded one Israeli in the northern resort of Nahariya
on Sunday but police said they believed the attack was the work
of a common criminal not a Palestinian militant.


"An unknown assailant riding a motorbike threw two grenades in
different streets in Nahariya and an Israeli was seriously
wounded," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP.


"Apparently, it's a criminal matter -- police have launched a
manhunt for the assailant and have set up roadblocks around
Nahariya."
