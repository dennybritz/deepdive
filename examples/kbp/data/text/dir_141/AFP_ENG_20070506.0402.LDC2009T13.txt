Italy's centre-left Prime Minister Romano Prodi warmly
congratulated French presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy on
his "handsome victory" in Sunday's elections.


"Dear Nicolas, I would like to offer you my most sincere,
friendly and affectionate congratulations for your handsome
electoral victory and for your appointment to the presidency of
the French republic," he said in a message reported by ANSA news
agency.


"Our common work in Europe and across the world does not start
today. We began it several years ago in our previous jobs. In the
same way, the relationship between Italy and France does not
begin today, because our two countries have been linked for
centuries by a shared destiny.


"My country, my government and myself, personally, continue to
consider France as a key ally and you, personally, as a friend."


Rightwinger Sarkozy won 53 percent of the vote in Sunday's
presidential poll, beating socialist candidate Segolene Royal,
who won 47 percent, according to reliable projections.


"With your election, France has gained a great president, Europe
a great statesman and Italy a great friend," added Claudio
Scajola, one of the leaders of Forza Italia, the party of former
Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.
