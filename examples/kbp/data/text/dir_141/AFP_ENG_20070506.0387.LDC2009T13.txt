Thousands of cheering Nicolas Sarkozy supporters thronged a
central Paris square Sunday to celebrate his French presidential
election victory and wait for his triumphal arrival.


"We wanted to be here because it will be like France's World Cup
victory in 1998," said Luc Ramseyer, who with his wife travelled
hundreds of kilometres (miles) from his home in eastern France to
celebrate in the Place de la Concorde.


The crowd cheered wildly as Sarkozy's victory was announced on a
huge screen set up in the cobbled square that lies at the bottom
of the Champs Elysees avenue.


Sarkozy, who defeated the Socialist Segolene Royal, was expected
to make a speech at the square later in the evening.


He left his campaign headquarters shortly after his win was
confirmed and went straight to a concert hall where he made his
initial victory address.


"Now is the time for me to give back to France what France has
given to me," he told thousands of ecstatic supports gathered in
the hall.
