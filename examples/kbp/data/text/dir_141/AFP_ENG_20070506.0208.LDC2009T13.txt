Several hundred students demonstrated in Goma, in the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Sunday to protest
against the murder of a fellow student.


The demonstrators blocked traffic near the Goma university campus
and put up barricades after the killing in the small hours of
Sunday, the second student murder within a week.


Witnesses said two soldiers killed the student and took 1,500
Congolese francs (less than three dollars) and his mobile phone.


Last weekend, a student from the same university was murdered by
a civilian armed with a Kalashnikov rifle who took his mobile
phone.
