Socialist Segolene Royal conceded defeat on Sunday in the French
presidential election to rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy.


Royal, speaking to her supporters, said she hoped that "the next
president of the republic will accomplish his mandate for the
service of all French people."


The 53-year-old former adviser to president Francois Mitterrand
had hoped to become France's first woman president, campaigning
on a platform that called for protecting the country's generous
welfare system.
