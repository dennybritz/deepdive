The US military will allow family members to visit seven
suspected Iranian agents who have been detained in Iraq,
spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Garver said Sunday.


He would not say when the visit would take place, although an
Iranian spokesman had earlier said that this could be before the
end of the week.


After talking with the Iraqi government and the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the military "agreed to allow the
family members to see the seven Qods Force members in detention,"
Garver said.


The Qods Force is a covert arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard
which has been accused by US commanders of supplying weapons and
training to extremist groups involved in the Iraqi conflict.


Tehran insists the detainees are diplomats and has demanded their
release.


In January, American commandos arrested five Iranians who were
working at an Iranian office in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil.
It is still not clear where and when the two other Iranians were
captured.
