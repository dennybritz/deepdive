Three more US soldiers have been killed in insurgent attacks in
Baghdad and the restive western province of Anbar, the US
military reported on Sunday.


Two marines were killed in Anbar on Saturday "while conducting
combat operations," while one army soldier was killed and four
wounded on Friday when a roadside bomb hit their patrol in west
Baghdad, statements said.


The latest casualties brought the number of US servicemen to die
in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,365, according to an
AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
