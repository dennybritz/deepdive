A British soldier who was seriously injured by a roadside bomb in
southern Iraq last week died on Sunday in a British hospital, the
defence ministry said.


The soldier, whose name and age were not released, was from the
Royal Logistic Corps and was seriously injured on Thursday when a
homemade bomb struck an equipment transporter the soldier was
travelling in, it said.


The soldier's next of kin had been informed.


There have been 148 British military deaths since the March 2003
US-led invasion of the country to oust then dictator Saddam
Hussein. Some 114 of those were soldiers who died in action.


Britain has about 7,100 soldiers in Iraq, most of whom are around
the southern city of Basra. The government has pledged to
withdraw about 1,600 this year.
