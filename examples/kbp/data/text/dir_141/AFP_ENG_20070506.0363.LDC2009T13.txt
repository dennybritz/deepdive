Thousands of rightwing voters burst into applause and wild
cheering Sunday after Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential victory was
announced at the concert hall where he was due to make a speech.


The flag-waving supporters were gathered at the hall where he was
due to make a victory speech at 8:30 pm (1830 GMT) after winning
the vote with about 53 percent of the vote, according to early
projections from polling firms.
