The constituent meeting for Italy's new centrist party, to be
formed by merging the two major centre-left parties, will take
place in mid-October, Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Sunday.


The former communist Democrats of the Left (DS) and the smaller
centrist Daisy party led by Culture Minister Francesco Rutelli
said last month they would unite, aiming to form Italy's largest
party.


The Ansa news agency quoted Prodi as saying that local elections
at the end of this month and the summer holidays left little time
to form the party before the autumn.


"October 15 or 16 seem to me splendid dates, dates that suit me,"
Prodi said.


The merger is the brainchild of Prodi, who has called it a dream
come true after a 12-year "marathon".


On the basis of the last election results, the new party would
represent 28 percent of Italian voters, against 24 for former
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italy, which is
currently the country's largest single party.
