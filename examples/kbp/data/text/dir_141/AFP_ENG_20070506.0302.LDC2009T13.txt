A British soldier who was seriously injured by a roadside bomb in
southern Iraq last week died on Sunday in a British hospital, the
defence ministry said.


The soldier, whose name and age were not released, was from the
Royal Logistic Corps and was "very seriously injured" on Thursday
when a homemade bomb struck an equipment transporter the soldier
was travelling in, it said.


The soldier's next of kin had been informed.


Britain has about 7,100 soldiers in Iraq, most of whom are around
the southern city of Basra. The government has pledged to
withdraw about 1,600 this year.
