Irish trainer Jim Bolger made up for the disappointment of
Teofilo missing out on the English 2000 Guineas by landing the
1000 Guineas here on Sunday with Finsceal Beo.


Bolger, who is a dab hand with the fillies having landed the
Epsom Oaks with 66/1 chance Jet Ski Lady, watched from the stands
as his son-in-law Kevin Manning brought his filly home at 5/4.


Another Irish runner Arch Swing chased the 5-4 favourite home but
never looked like catching her with Simply Perfect in third.


Bolger had suffered last minute disappointment in the 2000
Guineas when Teofilo, the close season favourite for the race and
named after legendary Cuban amateur boxer Teofilo Stevenson, was
ruled out because of a last-minute injury.


Victory in the fillies' Classic was compensation for him as it
was for punters after 25-1 outsider Cockney Rebel won the 2000
Guineas on Saturday.


Sander Camillo, who had been the antepost second-favourite for
the 1000 Guineas, was withdrawn earlier on Sunday because she was
in season.
