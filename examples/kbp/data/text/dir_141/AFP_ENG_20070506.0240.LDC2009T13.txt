Iranian police have seized a stash of almost eight tonnes of
cannabis in a restive eastern province, the state-run IRNA agency
reported on Sunday.


Around 7,720 kilogrammes (17,000 pounds) of cannabis were
confiscated from the smugglers' hideout in the mountains around
the town of Sarbaz in the province of Sistan Baluchestan, on the
border with Pakistan, a local police official told the agency.


"In an effective tactical operation four Kalashnikovs and one
RPG-7 (rocket propelled grenade) were discovered and confiscated
as the smugglers tried to escape," police official Eskandar
Momeni said.


Iran is a major conduit for the smuggling of drugs from
neighbouring countries, especially Afghanistan, towards western
Europe and security forces are frequently involved in deadly
clashes with heavily armed smugglers.


Drug smuggling is punishable by death in Iran, where the
consumption and distribution of any kind of recreational drug or
alcohol is strictly prohibited.


Iran is also working to combat drug use at home and unofficial
figures reported by the press have estimated that 2 million out
of Iran's 70 million population are drug addicts.


It also seizes millions of litres annually of alcohol illegally
imported into the country, destroying four million litres of
illicit booze during the last Iranian year, ending March 2007.
