France's reigning three-time world champion Sebastien Loeb won
the Rally of Argentina, the sixth round of the world
championship, on Sunday.


Loeb finished ahead of Finnish Ford Focus drivers Marcus Gronholm
and Mikko Hirvonen.


Seven special stages had to be cancelled on Friday following
flight problems after the opening super special on Thursday night
in Buenos Aires when teams were not able to arrive in time.


Loeb took the lead from Hirvonen early on Saturday and did not
look back as he motored his way to the title. He leads the
overall drivers' standings with 48 points, with Gronholm second
on 45 and Hirvonen third on 37.


Ford however lie on top of the constructors' standings with 81
points ahead of Citroen on 72.
