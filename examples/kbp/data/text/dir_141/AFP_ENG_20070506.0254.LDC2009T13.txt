Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber won his first ATP title after six
years on the men's circuit at the Munich Open here Sunday,
defeating Mikhail Youzny of Russia 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.


The 23-year-old local favourite, appearing in his first final,
made his big breakthrough, ironically, against his doubles
partner and third seed in a little over two hours.


Kohlschreiber, ranked 49th in the world, knocked out two further
seeds en route to the final, Cyprus' Marcos Baghdatis in the
semi-finals and Finland's Jarkko Nieminen in the first round.


The Bavarian-born player dropped his first set of the tournament
as he struggled to find his rhythm on the Munich clay but it was
a different story in the second as he broke Youzny's serve twice
to level.


In the third he was leading 40-15 and 5-4 but needed five match
points to seal victory on an error from Youzny.


"The end of the match was a little difficult, but it's a
fantastic feeling to finish the week undefeated," said last
month's Monte Carlo quarter-finalist.


Kohlschreiber became the first German player to win the Munich
Open since Michael Stich in 1994.
