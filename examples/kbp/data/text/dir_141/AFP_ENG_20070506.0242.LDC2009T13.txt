One of America's premier newspapers wrote Sunday that the time
has come to bring US troops home from Iraq, as support across the
United States for continuing US military operations there
continues to erode.


"After four years of war, more than 350 billion dollars spent and
3,363 US soldiers killed and 24,310 wounded, it seems
increasingly obvious that an Iraqi political settlement cannot be
achieved in the shadow of an indefinite foreign occupation," the
moderately left-of-center newspaper wrote.


"Having invested so much in Iraq, Americans are likely to find
disengagement almost as painful as war. But the longer we delay
planning for the inevitable, the worse the outcome is likely to
be," the LA Times editorial read.


"The time has come to leave."


The paper wrote that the US government "should immediately
declare its intention to begin a gradual troop drawdown, starting
no later than the fall."


It added that a current "surge" of tens of thousands of
additional US troops in Iraq does not appear to have turned the
tide of sectarian violence and insurgent attacks.


"This newspaper reluctantly endorsed the US troop surge as the
last, best hope for stabilizing conditions so that the elected
Iraqi government could assume full responsibility for its
affairs. But we also warned that the troops should not be used to
referee a civil war," the daily wrote.


"That, regrettably, is what has happened."
