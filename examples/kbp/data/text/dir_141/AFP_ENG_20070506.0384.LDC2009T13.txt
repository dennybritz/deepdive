The wreckage of a Kenyan Airways plane carrying 114 people and
missing for more than 36 hours was found Sunday in southwest
Cameroon, an official said.


The source close to the Cameroon civil aviation authority told
AFP a helicopter found the shell of a Boeing 737-800 about 50
kilometres east of Douala. There was no immediate word on
survivors.
