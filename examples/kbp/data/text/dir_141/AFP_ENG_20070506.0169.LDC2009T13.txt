Twenty miners died in a gas explosion in a northern China coal
mine, state media reported Sunday, in the latest accident to
strike the country's notoriously dangerous coal mining industry.


The explosion occurred Saturday afternoon, trapping 30 workers,
20 of whose bodies have been recovered by rescue teams, Xinhua
news agency reported.


Rescue efforts continued Sunday for the remaining 10 miners
trapped in the colliery in Shanxi province.


Local police are investigating two of the Pudeng Coal Mine's
managers, Xinhua said.


It quoted provincial officials as saying the mine had been
previously ordered to suspend production, but its operators had
continued without a permit.


China's coal miners typically labour under appalling conditions
as many mine owners cut corners on safety to maximise production
of the country's most important energy source.


More than 4,700 workers were killed last year, according to
official figures, but independent labour groups put the death
toll at up to 20,000 annually.
