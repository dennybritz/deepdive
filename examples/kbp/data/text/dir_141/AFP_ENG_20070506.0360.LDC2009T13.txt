Rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy won the French presidential election
on Sunday, beating Socialist Segolene Royal with about 53 percent
of the vote, according to early projections from polling firms.


Royal, seeking to become France's first woman president, garnered
about 47 percent of the vote, according to the projections.


Sarkozy, a 52-year-old son former interior minister, succeeds
President Jacques Chirac who is stepping down after 12 years in
office.


Thousands of Sarkozy supporters cheered and waved French
tricolore flags outside a concert hall where the rightwinger was
due to deliver a victory speech.
