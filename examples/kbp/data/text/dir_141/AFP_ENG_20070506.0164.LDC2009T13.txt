The French army chiefs-of-staff confirmed to AFP on Sunday that
"several soldiers, including French ones" belonging to the
Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) peacekeeping mission had
died in a plane crash in Egypt's northern Sinai region.


Earlier, Egyptian authorities put the toll at nine military
personnel including eight French.


Witnesses in the area told AFP and Egyptian public television
that the plane smashed into a truck as it was attempting an
emergency landing before crashing into the side of a mountain.


The MFO is an independent peacekeeping force not related to the
United Nations, created as a result of the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty and funded mainly by the two neighbours and the
United States.
