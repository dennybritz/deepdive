Supporters of Nicolas Sarkozy erupted in cheers Sunday,
celebrating unconfirmed reports of a resounding victory for the
rightwinger in France's presidential election.


Cries of "We won!" rose from the crowd of supporters gathered at
a concert hall in Paris where the right wing leader was scheduled
to give an election night speech.


French law forbids the publication of projections until the last
polling booths close at 8:00pm (1800 GMT) although the figures
are distributed to media and party headquarters up to 90 minutes
in advance.
