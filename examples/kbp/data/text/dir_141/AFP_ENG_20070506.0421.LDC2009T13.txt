British Prime Minister Tony Blair telephoned French president-
elect Nicolas Sarkozy to congratulate him on his victorious
election campaign, Blair's Downing Street office said Sunday.


"The PM has already spoken to Sarkozy to offer his
congratulations. I have no more details," a spokeswoman for
Blair's office told AFP.


Right-winger Sarkozy defeated Socialist rival Segolene Royal,
triggering wild celebrations among Sarkozy supporters in Paris as
soon as polls closed and projections said the 52-year-old former
interior minister had around 53 percent of the vote, against
Royal's 47 percent.


Sarkozy's victory comes just days before Blair is expected to
announce his own resignation after a decade in power in Britain
later this week.
