Australia's Qantas said Sunday it considered an 11.1 billion
dollar (9.2 billion US) bid to take over the airline to be dead,
even though regulators have yet to decide on a final appeal.


"While (private equity group) APA has made several regulatory
applications over the weekend, the Qantas Board considers that
the current bid has failed," the airline said in a statement.
