The wreckage of a Kenyan Airways plane carrying 114 people was
found on Sunday in swampland in southwest Cameroon more than 36
hours after it went missing, an official said.


There was no immediate word on any survivors, the source close to
the Cameroon civil aviation authority told AFP.


A helicopter found the shell of a Boeing 737-800 about 50
kilometres (31 miles) east of Douala shortly after 6:00 pm (1700
GMT), near the village of Edea, the source said.


Another Cameroonian official ruled out the possibility of any
survivors.


"A team of specialists should arrive at the scene tomorrow
(Monday), notably experts to identify bodies through DNA," said
the official, who declined to be named.


A Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority official said earlier that
rescue teams in Cameroon believed they had found the wreckage of
the six-months-old Boeing 737.


Kenya Airways CEO Titus Naikuni had told a news conference
earlier on Sunday that fisherman had reported hearing "a loud
bang that was accompanied by a disturbance of water."


The plane was carrying 105 passengers from at least 23 countries
and nine Kenyan crew. It sent out a distress signal shortly after
taking off from Douala in a violent storm after midnight Friday,
headed for Nairobi.
