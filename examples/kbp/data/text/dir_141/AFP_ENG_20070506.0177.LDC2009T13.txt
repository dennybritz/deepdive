One Palestinian was killed and six others wounded on Sunday when
gunmen opened fire at a school run by the UN agency for
Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, medics and security
sources said.


Gunmen from a religious extremist group opened fire at the school
in the southern town of Rafah as children there gathered for a
party, they said.


The dead man was identified as Majid Abu Shamallah, a bodyguard
of an official from president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party who was
at the event.
