Right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy acknowledged his presidential
election victory Sunday, saying that "now is the time for me to
give back to France what France has given to me."


"Together we are going to write a new page of history. The page,
I am sure, will be great and it will be beautiful," he said in a
speech before delighted supporters in central Paris.


In a message to the defeated Socialist Segolene Royal, Sarkozy
said: "I have respect for her and her ideas, which so many French
people shared. To respect Madame Royal is to respect the millions
who voted for her."


Projections said that Sarkozy won the election with 53 percent of
the vote against 47 percent for Royal.
