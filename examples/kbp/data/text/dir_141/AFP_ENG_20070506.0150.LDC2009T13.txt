Turnout in the French presidential election on Sunday reached
nearly 35 percent by midday, the highest morning turnout for more
than three decades, officials said.


Voters were choosing a successor to Jacques Chirac, with
rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy the clear favourite to triumph over
Socialist Segolene Royal.


By noon, 34.11 percent of France's 44.5 million registered voters
had turned up at the polls, up from 31.21 percent in the April 22
first round and from 26.2 percent in the 2002 election, said the
interior ministry.


It was the highest turnout registered at midday for the past four
elections (2002, 1995, 1988 and 1981), with only the 1974
election that was won by Valery Giscard d'Estaing registering a
higher participation rate at 35.62 percent at noon.


Overall turnout for the multi-candidate first round of voting on
April 22 reached 83.77 percent, the highest since the 1974
election when 84.2 percent of voters cast ballots.
