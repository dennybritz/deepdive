Kenya Airways confirmed late Sunday that the wreckage of a Kenyan
Airways plane carrying 114 people was found in swampland in
southwest Cameroon more than 36 hours after it went missing.


"Kenya Airways regrets to confirm that its flight KQ 507 has been
located on a mangrove swamp," near Douala, in Cameroon, from
where it took off, the company's CEO Titus Naikuni told a news
conference in Nairobi.


"We have no confirmed information about survivors or any possible
casualties," he said.


"The reason, apparently, that it was not sighted much earlier was
that the aircraft was covered by trees."


The plane was carrying 105 passengers from at least 23 countries
and nine Kenyan crew. It sent out a distress signal shortly after
taking off from Douala in a violent storm after midnight Friday,
headed for Nairobi.
