G8 labour and employment ministers began a summit on Sunday in
the east German city of Dresden aiming to agree on ways to ensure
a fairer distribution of the fruits of globalisation.


The German presidency of the EU and of the G8 -- the seven most
industrialised nations plus Russia -- wants to secure a guarantee
of social minimums and agree on strategies for more and better
jobs and improving social protection in developed and developing
countries.


The summit, running until Tuesday, is being attended by
representatives from the EU Commission, the International Labour
Organisation, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), civil society and the World Bank.


The participants hope to agree on a statement to send to a summit
of G8 leaders in Heiligendamm in northern Germany on June 6-8.
