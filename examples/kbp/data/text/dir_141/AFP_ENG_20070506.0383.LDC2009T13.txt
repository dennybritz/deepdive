Hardline Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad wounded an
Israeli civilian Sunday in the latest retaliatory rocket fire
from the Gaza Strip following the killing of three of its
militants.


The Israeli suffered moderate wounds when a rocket struck the
southern town of Sderot, hometown of embattled Defence Minister
Amir Peretz, medical and army sources said.


It was the fifth rocket fired on southern Israel from Gaza during
the day,  an army spokesman said.


Jihad's military wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, said it carried out
the attack and warned that further resprials would follow.


Israeli troops killed three Jihad militants near the northern
West Bank town of Jenin on Friday.


The same day, the militant group fired three rockets on southern
Israel from Gaza, one of which caused damage to a building in
Sderot.


Islamic Jihad was not party to a November truce under which
Israeli troops pulled out of Gaza in return for a commitment from
militant groups to end rocket fire from the territory.


But it did take part in Egyptian-brokered talks last month aimed
at shoring up the truce after the armed wing of the Hamas
movement of prime minister Ismail Haniya briefly announced it
would no longer respect it.
