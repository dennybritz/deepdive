Two Tajik citizens were found murdered on a Moscow street on
Sunday in what may have been a racially motivated attack, the RIA
Novosti news agency reported.


The two men, both of them manual labourers in a market, appear to
have died from head wounds, the agency quoted a spokesman with
the city prosecutor's office as saying.


The attempted murder of a third Tajik is also being investigated,
he said.


"The investigation will examine various explanations for the
murders including that of racial hatred," the spokesman said.


Critics of the government have warned that a recent ban on
foreigners working in markets risks provoking an increase in the
already high number of racist attacks in Russia.


Migrant workers from ex-Soviet republics such as impoverished
Tajikistan are considered particularly at risk.


Last year the number of victims of racist attacks rose by 17
percent to 539, of whom 54 people died, the Sova monitoring
centre said in March.
