The final of the WTA tournament here between top seed Justine
Henin of Belgium and unseeded Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine was
postponed due to rain on Sunday.


The match has been re-scheduled to be played on Monday, depending
on the weather conditions.


Bondarenko, who was scheduled to play her first match in the
Qatar Total Open in Berlin on Monday had to ask for the match to
be postponed until Tuesday.


If the weather is not good enough to play the final at the courts
in Warsaw, the WTA tour officials are considering the division of
points and prize money between the two players.


Whether the final is held on Monday or not, it is confirmed that
Henin will remain the world number one in the rankings.
Bondarenko will move into the top 30.
