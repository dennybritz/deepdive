Moroccan police said they smashed overnight a network of
recruiters for Al- Qaeda's branch in North Africa, making about
20 arrests in raids across the country.


"The arrests took place in several Moroccan towns, in particular
in Fes and Nador," a police spokesman said. "The people arrested
all had Moroccan nationality."


Morocco has stepped up anti-terrorist operations, training
thousands of extra police and arresting dozens following a series
of suicide bombings in Casablanca during March and April.


Six bombers died after blowing themselves up and a seventh was
killed by police before he could detonate his bomb. One policeman
was killed and 45 people injured including nine seriously.


Earlier this year the Algerian-based Salafist Group for Preaching
and Combat (GSPC) renamed itself as Al-Qaeda's branch in North
Africa.
