Thomas Dekker won the Tour de Romandie after capturing the fifth
and final stage, a 20.4km time trial around Lausanne, on Sunday.


The Dutch Rabobank rider capped the overall standings in a
winning time of 17 hours 27 minutes and 2 seconds.


He clinched the ProTour event clocking 26:36.24 in the time
trial. Italy's Paolo Savoldelli (Astana) took second, 5sec off
the pace with another Astana rider, Kazakhstan's Andriy
Kaschechkin, 12sec away in third.


"I'm happy but surprised as this wasn't on my programme. The time
trial is my speciality, I thought I'd make the podium but not
necessarily as the winner," said Dekker.


He was followed home in the overall standings by the two riders
who finished closest to him in the last stage, Savoldelli by
11sec and Kashcheckin by 34sec.
