The head of Italy's employers federation said companies could be
forced to close because of drought and blamed the government for
failing to address the problem, in remarks published Thursday.


"The public investments needed in crucial sectors, like the water
system, have not been programmed and this year we risk having to
close some factories," Luca Cordera, speaking at a conference in
Berlin, was quoted as saying.


"Every summer we have a problem, and every time there are urgency
measures once the damage is done, with tinkering that never
really solves the problem," he said.


On May 4, Italy's cabinet is to consider a series of new measures
to alleviate the consequences of drought in Italy.


Rainfall between last September and April was 20 and 50 percent
lower than a year earlier, causing severe problems for
agriculture, especially in the northern Italian Po region.
