China on Thursday warned foreigners to avoid getting involved in
sensitive sovereignty issues, after four Americans were
reportedly detained for staging a protest calling for Tibetan
independence.


"Any foreign citizens that come to China, it is their due
obligation to abide by the laws of China," foreign ministry
spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters.


"When they are in China, they shall not engage in activities
concerning the sovereignty or unity of China."


Liu did not confirm the four were in police detention following
the protest on Wednesday at Mount Everest bast camp, as a Tibetan
rights group has said.


However, he said authorities were looking into the issue.


"The relevant authorities in China are making an investigation
and are dealing with the case," Liu said.


The four were detained after unfurling banners demanding a "free
Tibet" and protesting plans to take the Olympic torch to the top
of the mountain ahead of the 2008 Beijing Games, according to the
Washington-based Students for a Free Tibet.


Liu refused to say whether US officials would be given consular
access to the protesters, as has been requested.


China has ruled Tibet since sending troops in to "liberate" the
region in 1951.
