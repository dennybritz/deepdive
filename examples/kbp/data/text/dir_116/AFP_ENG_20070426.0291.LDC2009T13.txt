Ford Motor Co. announced Thursday its first quarter loss was
sharply narrowed to 282 million dollars, citing progress in a
painful reorganization leading to results much better than market
forecasts.


The struggling Detroit automaker said the results compared with a
loss of 1.4 billion dollars in the same period a year ago.


The loss equated to nine cents a share excluding one-time costs,
much better than the deficit of 60 cents per share expected on
Wall Street.


Revenues for the January-March quarter increased five percent to
43 billion dollars, well ahead of market expectations.


The company said divisions such as Ford Europe, Ford South
America and Mazda all were profitable and that cost savings
programs for North America were starting to help the results.


"We are making progress on executing the four priorities of our
plan -- restructuring the company, accelerating product
development, funding our plan and working effectively as one
team," said chief executive Alan Mulally.  "I am pleased that the
basics of our business are improving, but we still have a lot of
work to do."
