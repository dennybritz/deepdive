Estonian riot police sealed off a Soviet war monument in central
Tallinn on Thursday ahead of its removal to a less prominent
location, a plan that has brought strong protests from Moscow.


The Bronze Soldier which commemorates Soviet Red Army troops who
drove the Nazis out of Estonia was fenced off and surrounded by
riot police early Thursday to prevent pro-Russian protesters
interrupting preparatory work.


"We picked the early hours for the start of the work to minimise
possible conflicts," Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip told
Estonian Television.


"In the coming days, excavation work will begin, to see if anyone
lies buried there and who these people might be," Ansip said.


Last week, the Estonian government said it intended to start
digging at the huge statue to exhume and rebury any fallen
soldiers buried beneath it.


That plan has provoked angry outbursts from Moscow, which views
the monument as a memorial to those who defeated fascism in World
War II.


However, many Estonians see the statue as a painful reminder of
nearly five decades of occupation by the Soviets, which began at
the end of the war and only ended in 1991 when the USSR crumbled.


Police reported a minor incident at the monument Thursday, when
three people locked themselves inside a car and refused to move
away from the area.


"Police had to break the car window to identify the people after
they failed to obey police orders," law enforcement spokesman
Harrys Puusepp said.


A fence has been erected around the monument and a tent is being
put up to cover the area during excavation work.
