Outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo, facing a wall of anger at
home and abroad over Nigeria's flawed presidential poll, said he
had no problem with planned opposition protests provided they
were orderly.


"If you want to demonstrate, demonstration is part of democracy,
provided it does not lead to disorderliness," he said in an
interview late Wednesday.


Earlier a broad opposition coalition, as well as civil society
groups, announced mass action next week to demand the
cancellation of polls which foreign monitors from the European
Union, the United States and other rights groups said were marred
by massive fraud and violence.
