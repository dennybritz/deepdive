The Chinese embassy in Ethiopia expressed hope Thursday for the
release of seven Chinese oil workers seized in an attack this
week in which 77 people died, including nine Chinese.


"We're hoping that they'll be released soon. There are some good
signs but I can't tell you more," embassy spokeswoman Sun Qing
told AFP.


"We are trying to rescue the Chinese workers, but we can't give
further details due to the sensitivity of the matter."


Ethiopia sent an investigation team to the oil field in its
remote eastern region after Tuesday's dawn raid by scores of
rebels.


The Ogaden National Liberation Front separatist group claimed
responsibility for the attack in Ogaden, where the ONLF is
fighting for the independence of ethnic Somalis.


Authorities in Somali region, which includes Ogaden, decreed two
days of mourning starting Thursday in memory of victims of the
attack.


Ethiopian state television reported Thursday that the bodies of
the nine slain Chinese had arrived in a hospital in Addis Ababa,
awaiting instructions from their families for repatriation.


"Condolences were offered to families of the deceased ... on
behalf of the Ethiopian government and its people," ETV reported.


Chinese oil major Sinopec said Thursday it had no plans to pull
out of resource- rich Africa despite the attack in Ethiopia.


Sinopec is the parent company of Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration
Bureau, the operator of the Ogaden oil venture.
