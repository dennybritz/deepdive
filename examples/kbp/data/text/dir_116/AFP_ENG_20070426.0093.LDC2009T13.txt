Chinese share prices closed 1.04 percent higher Thursday in
another record performance made on the back of continued fund
inflows and a strenghtening yuan with property and tourism stocks
gaining ground, dealers said.


They said stregnth in the yuan and expectations of solid gains in
Friday's dual Shanghai and Hong Kong listing of China's CITIC
bank, the nation's seventh largest lender, helped buoy sentiment.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, rose 39.10 points at 3,783.06 on turnover of 142.17
billion yuan (18.39 billion dollars).


Thursday's showing was the fourth consecutive record finish this
week for the composite index.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 40.73 points or 1.04 percent at
3,975.68 on turnover of 141.10 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index added 14.99 points or 1.37 percent at 1,108.03,
also a fresh record, on turnover of 77.81 billion yuan.
