England defender Jonathan Woodgate has handed Middlesbrough a
huge boost by agreeing to make his loan move from Real Madrid
permanent.


Woodgate has been considering his options for several months with
Arsenal and Newcastle among the clubs reportedly monitoring his
situation now that he finally seems to have overcome the injury
problems which blighted his time in Spain.


But he is now understood to have decided to stay at his home town
club, which will mean Boro paying Real a fee of around six
million pounds. Details of Woodgate's contract were expected to
be confirmed later on Thursday.


Woodgate's decision will come as a relief to Boro boss Gareth
Southgate, who is currently attempting to persuade another key
member of his squad, Australian striker Mark Viduka, to stay at
the club when his contract expires at the end of the season.


With a player of Woodgate's calibre agreeing to stay, it will be
easier for Southgate to persuade the likes of Viduka that they
can achieve things at the club, as well as helping to attract new
players.
