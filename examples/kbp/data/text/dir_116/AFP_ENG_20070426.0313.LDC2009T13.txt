A car bomb killed six people and wounded 18 in the Iraqi capital
Thursday despite a more than two-month-old US and Iraqi
crackdown, a security official said.


The blast struck at around 4:00 pm (1200 GMT) on a main road in
the southern Jadiriyah district's Al-Hussein Square, the official
said.


A series of other attacks in Iraq killed a further 16 people on
Thursday, nine of them Iraqi soldiers.
