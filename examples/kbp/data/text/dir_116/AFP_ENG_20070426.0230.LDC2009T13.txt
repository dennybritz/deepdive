Arsene Wenger has paid tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson's achievement
in building his third great Manchester United team by saying he
deserves to be named as the Premiership's manager of the year.


Wenger said Steve Coppell also deserved recognition for
establishing Reading in the top flight following their promotion
as Championship winners last season, and for their attractive
style.


The Frenchman has clashed frequently with Ferguson over the years
but he had no hesitation in naming his old adversary when asked
for his manager of the year, while snubbing the claims of Chelsea
boss Jose Mourinho, whose side could yet complete a clean sweep
of all four competitions they have entered.


"I feel this year Sir Alex Ferguson, because he's in a position
to fight on every front," Wenger said. "And Steve Coppell, who is
in a position where nobody expected him to be and has a team who
does not play negatively - they have a positive attitude
everywhere they go."


Wenger, meanwhile, admits that the season has petered out into a
big let-down for his youthful side following last term's march to
the Champions League final.


"This year we had a massive disappointment, I feel overall,
especially in going out of the Champions League the way we went
out," he said.


"But it's part of a growing process as well to handle this kind
of disappointment and to still not let your disappointment stop
your progression."
