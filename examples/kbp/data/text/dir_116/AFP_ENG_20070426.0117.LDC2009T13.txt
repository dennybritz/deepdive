The 10-year jail sentence given to the man who slashed the face
of a leading South Korean female politician has been upheld
Thursday by the nation's Supreme Court.


Park Geun-Hye, who was then head of the main opposition Grand
National Party (GNP) and is now a leading presidential hopeful,
suffered an 11 cm (four inch) scar, when she was attacked at a
campaign rally last year.


Ex-convict Ji Choong-Ho, 50, claimed he staged the assault in
anger at what he called wrongful convictions in the past. He had
served a total of 14 years in prison for various offences.


Prosecutors said he had no political motive.


Park's wound required 60 stitches. But she returned to the
campaign trail just 10 days later and helped ensure the rout of
the ruling Uri party in local elections last year.


Her calmness was reminiscent of her father, authoritarian
president Park Chung- Hee.


He finished a speech after his wife was shot dead by an
assassin's bullet aimed at him in 1974.


Park was himself shot dead by his spy chief in 1979.
