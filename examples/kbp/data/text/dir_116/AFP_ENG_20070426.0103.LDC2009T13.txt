Sri Lankan war planes bombed areas in rebel-held territory in the
island's north on Thursday, a day after fierce ground battles
between the two sides, the rebels said.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said military jets
dropped a dozen bombs over a residential area of the Kilinochchi
district, 330 kilometres (206 miles) north of the capital,
Colombo.


The rebels added that two civilians were wounded in the attacks.


The air raids followed fierce fighting Wednesday in the
neighbouring district of Mannar, where both sides claimed they
had inflicted heavy casualties.


The defence ministry said that a total of 21 Tamil Tiger rebels
were killed and another 28 wounded in those ground battles.


The ministry placed its own losses at three killed and 23
wounded.


However, Tamil Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said they beat
back a military offensive into territory held by them and
inflicted heavy casualties on Sri Lankan soldiers.


The rebels said they killed at least 10 government troops and
wounded another 50.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in an upsurge of violence
in Sri Lanka that began in December 2005.


The fighting has flared despite a truce arranged in 2002, which
was supposed to end the country's bloody ethnic conflict.


The rebels have waged a 35-year campaign for independence for Sri
Lanka's Tamil minority.


The fighting has claimed more than 60,000 lives on the island,
most of whose people are Sinhalese.
