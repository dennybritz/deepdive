Electrolux, the world's biggest household appliances maker,
reported mixed first quarter earnings news on Thursday, as a
restructuring plan begins to bite.


Net profit was down 39 percent at 492 million kronor (53.64
million euros, 73.21 million dollars), it said in a statement.


But on a like for like basis, when the costs of last year's
restructuring, which involved the closure of factories in Europe
are taken out, the net profit rose by 30.5 percent


Sales in the first quarter were 24.930 billion kronor, an
increase of 1.5 percent compared to the 24.553 billion in the
same period a year ago, it said.


Operating profit increased 66.4 percent to 757 million against
455 million a year earlier.


"Operating income for the first quarter of 2007 confirms clearly
that all business areas are on the right track. We exceeded our
forecast and our income improved by about 25 percent over the
same period last year. We also expanded our market shares in all
regions," Electrolux chairman Hans Straaberg said in a statement.


"We are maintaining our forecast that operating income, excluding
items affecting comparability, for 2007 will be somewhat higher
than in 2006, despite increased costs for raw materials and
uncertainty regarding the market development in the US," he said.


Electrolux shares opened 4.27 percent lower at 179 kronor in
early deals on the Stockholm stock exchange, with the overall
market 0.18 percent higher.
