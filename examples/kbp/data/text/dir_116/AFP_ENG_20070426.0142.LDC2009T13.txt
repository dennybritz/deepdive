Dubai's Emirates airline posted Thursday a 25 percent surge in
its annual profits to 844 million dollars in the financial year
2006-07 despite high fuel costs.


The carrier's revenues totaled 8.1 billion dollars in 2006-07
compared to 6.3 billion dollars the previous year, the company
said announcing its annual results.


Net profits hit 3.1 billion dirhams (844 million dollars)
compared to 2.5 billion dirhams (674 million dollars) the
previous year, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, Emirates
chairman and chief executive, told reporters.


"Pressure from fuel costs has softened our profits," he said,
adding that the fuel surcharge added on tickets has covered only
50 percent of added fuel costs, which in turn represented 29
percent of operational costs.


He also said that the delay in the delivery of the 43 long-haul
Airbus A380s has affected the company's expansion plans. The
first of these aircraft is now to be delivered in August 2008, he
said.


Total revenues of the whole Emirates Group, which includes the
air travel services branch, Dnata, and other subsidiaries reached
31.1 billion dirhams (8.5 billion dollars), he said.


The group's profits reached 3.5 billion dirhams (942 million
dollars), compared to 762 million dollars the previous year, he
added.


Emirates, which was launched in 1985 with two leased planes, now
boasts a fleet of 102 aircraft, with orders for 107 more planes.
It flies to 89 destinations in 59 countries.
