Russian President Vladimir Putin began his annual state of the
nation address Thursday with a moment of silence in tribute to
his late predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, who died Monday.


Putin began his address with words of praise for the late leader,
saying it was Yeltsin who gave Russia a new democratic
constitution that became "a significant instrument for unifying
society."
