Consumer sentiment in Germany, the biggest eurozone economy, rose
sharply in April giving further proof that a rise in value-added
tax had a negligible impact on consumer spending, a poll showed
on Thursday.


The consumer sentiment index calculated each month by market
research group GfK rose to 5.5 points from 4.4 points in March.


The figures showed that the government's decision to raise value-
added, or sales tax, to 19 percent from 16 percent from January 1
had not held consumers back for long, GfK said.


"Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the clear signs of
a strong economic upswing," the institute said in a statement.


"The overall good situation on the job market and further marked
increases in wage and salary levels mean that in addition to the
generally positive economic outlook, income expectations are also
rising sharply."


The German economy ministry on Wednesday raised growth forecasts
for 2007 to 2.3 percent -- a clear improvement on its previous
prediction of 1.7 percent.
