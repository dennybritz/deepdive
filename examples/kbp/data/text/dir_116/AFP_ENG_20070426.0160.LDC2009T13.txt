US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice rebuffed Thursday Russian
claims that Washington's plan to extend its missile shield would
upset the strategic balance in Europe.


Speaking ahead of talks with her NATO allies and Russian
counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Rice suggested that Moscow's thinking
on the shield, aimed at countering "rogue states" like Iran,
dates from the Cold War era.


"Let's be realistic, the idea that 10 interceptors is going to
upset the strategic balance is ludicrous," she told reporters in
Oslo after talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr
Stoere.


"We have to continue on the basis of a realistic assessment of
what we are proposing and not something that is somehow grounded
in the Eighties," she said.


Washington announced in January that it wanted to set up 10
missile interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic,
linked to a forward tracking system in the Caucasus, and wanted
the network operational by 2013.


Russia fears the system could target its missile arsenal and
start a new arms race, and it disagrees on the US assessment that
Iran could obtain weapons within a decade that would have the
range to strike at Europe.
