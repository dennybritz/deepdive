Nine Iraqi soldiers were killed and 15 people wounded in a
suicide car bombing against a joint Iraqi army and police
checkpoint north of Baghdad on Thursday, security officials said.


The bombing took place at around 10:00 am (0600 GMT) in the town
of Khalis in the restive province of Diyala where insurgents have
recently stepped up attacks against security forces, police
Lieutenant Mohammed Salem told AFP by telephone from the
provincial capital of Baquba.


The wounded consisted of five civilians as well as 10 soldiers,
another security official said, adding that six cars were also
damaged.


On Wednesday, a bomber wearing an explosive vest walked into a
police station in the town of Balad Ruz in Diyala and blew
himself up, killing four policemen and wounding 16 others.


And on Monday, nine US soldiers were killed and 20 more wounded
when two suicide truck bombers exploded their vehicles against
their patrol base in the province, in what was the deadliest
attack on US ground troops in 16 months.
