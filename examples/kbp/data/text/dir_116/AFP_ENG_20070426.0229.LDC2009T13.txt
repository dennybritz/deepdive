Scotland defender John Kennedy has completed a remarkable
comeback from a serious knee injury and multiple operations by
signing a new three-year contract at Celtic.


The Parkhead club announced the deal on Thursday, three years and
one month after Kennedy suffered a career-threatening injury on
his Scotland debut against Romania.


The defender made his return to first-team action in Sunday's 2-1
win over Kilmarnock which saw Celtic clinch a second straight
Scottish Premier League title.


Hoops boss Gordon Strachan has described Kennedy's comeback as a
"fairytale" while chief executive Peter Lawwell said his recovery
was testimony to the young man's remarkable fortitude.


"John has shown a real strength of character to overcome the
injury problems which he has faced in recent years," Lawwell
said.


"His return to the first team last weekend and his performance
were real highlights on what was a memorable day for the club.
John is most deserving of this new contract and we are delighted
he will remain at the club and hopefully play his part in our
future success."
