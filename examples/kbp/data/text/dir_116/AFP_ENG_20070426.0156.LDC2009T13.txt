Russian President Vladimir Putin called Thursday for a freeze on
Russian compliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
treaty limiting military deployments across the continent.


"I propose we declare a moratorium on fulfillment by Russia of
the CFE treaty," Putin said in his annual state of the nation
address.
