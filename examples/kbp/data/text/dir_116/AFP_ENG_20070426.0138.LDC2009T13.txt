Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that foreign money
was being used to interfere in Russia's affairs under the pretext
of spreading democracy.


"The flow of money from abroad used for direct interference in
our affairs is growing," Putin said in his annual state of the
nation address.


"There are those who, cunningly using pseudo-democratic
phraseology, want to go back to the past: some to undermine our
common national wealth, steal from the people and the state,
others to deprive the country of economic and political
independence," Putin said.


"It was in the colonial era that they talked about the so-called
civilizing role of the colonizing states," Putin said.


Democratic slogans are being used "for one purpose: to gain a
one-sided advantage, personal profits and to secure personal
interests," Putin said.


The Russian leader made his comments in what is likely to be his
last state-of- the-nation address before a presidential election
next year that critics accuse the Kremlin of preparing to stage
manage.


Putin has said the election will be free and fair.
