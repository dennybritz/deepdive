Egypt police detained a Palestinian would-be suicide bomber at
dawn Thursday as he entered the country illegally through a
tunnel under the border with the Gaza Strip, a security source
said.


When police called on Abdul Shafi Gabr Marahil, 25, to surrender,
he tried to throw a grenade at them but it fell short, seriously
wounding him, the source said.


Marahil, who failed to detonate his explosive belt, was
transferred to hospital in the North Sinai provincial capital of
El Arish, the source added.


Two suspected accomplices, who also slipped through the tunnel in
the divided border town of Rafah, managed to escape. Police have
launched a manhunt.


It was not immediately clear whether Marahil's intended target
was one of the South Sinai resorts which are popular with Israeli
tourists, or somewhere in Israel itself.


In March, Egypt detained two Palestinians who were planning to
carry out suicide bombings in Israel.


On January 29, a Palestinian suicide bomber, that the Israeli
authorities say entered from Gaza via Egypt, killed three people
in the Israeli resort of Eilat close to the Egyptian border.


Militants have constructed a warren of tunnels under the Gaza-
Egypt border that Israel charges are used for large-scale arms
smuggling as well as the infiltration of people.
