China Mobile, the country's largest handset operator, was ranked
as the world's fifth most valuable brand and the only non-US firm
among the top five, a market reseach firm said.


China Mobile enjoys a brand valuation of 41.2 billion dollars, up
five percent from a year earlier, compared with 66.4 billion
dollars of top-ranked Google, whose brand value surged 77
percent, US-based Millward Brown said.


The finding reinforces a trend for Chinese brands to gradually
emerge from obscurity, putting behind them a past when only beer
maker Tsingtao was known abroad.


The rankings were based on publicly available financial data as
well as research including interviews with over a million
consumers globally, Millward Brown said.


One of the notable trends this year is that consumers in emerging
markets, especially Brazil, Russia, India, China, have more
disposable income than ever before and western brands must cater
to local people, the study showed.
