Hong Kong share prices closed 0.64 percent higher Thursday as
investors cheered a record performance on Wall Street overnight
and further gains on the mainland's A-share markets, dealers
said.


They said the index came off the day's highs due to some profit-
taking in late trade.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 130.51 points at 20,667.29, off a
low of 20,651.29 and a high of 20,778.44. Turnover was 51.80
billion Hong Kong dollars (6.64 billion US).
