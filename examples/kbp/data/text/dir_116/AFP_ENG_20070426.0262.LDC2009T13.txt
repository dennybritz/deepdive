Nigeria's ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) won a senate
seat in the country's disputed polls last weekend without even
having to field a candidate, the opposition said Thursday.


"The PDP was declared the winner of Ondo south senatorial
district without a contestant," Dele Akinsola, a spokesman for
the opposition Labour Party, told AFP.


He accused the electoral commission, INEC, police and other
security agents of collaborating with the PDP to rig the
elections.


"The Ondo case is a clear example of the electoral fraud
perpetrated by the PDP with the tacit connivance of INEC, the
police and security forces," he added.


The results of state, parliamentary and presidential polls held
on April 14 and 21 gave a landslide victory to the PDP.


Both foreign and domestic observers who monitored the polls
without exception highlighted widespread rigging, ballot
stuffing, intimidation and violence.


The opposition and civil society groups have called for outright
cancellation of the elections and street protests against the
flawed vote.
