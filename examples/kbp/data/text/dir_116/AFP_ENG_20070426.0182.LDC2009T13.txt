The euro hit 162.55 yen in European trade early on Thursday, its
highest level against the Japanese currency, on optimism about
growth prospects for the 13-nation eurozone, dealers said.


The European single currency was also just shy of its record high
against the dollar, on expectations of further interest rate
rises for the eurozone.
