Ethiopian forces on Thursday seized control of insurgent
strongholds in northern Mogadishu after heavy fighting, residents
and the Somali prime minister said.


"We have nearly concluded the fighting in Mogadishu against Al
Qaeda insurgents and we are now chasing them away," Prime
Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi told a press conference in the capital.
