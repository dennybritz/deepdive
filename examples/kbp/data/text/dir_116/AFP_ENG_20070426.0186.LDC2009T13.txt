Some 200 Muslims on Thursday took to the streets to demand the
army-backed government lift a curfew in Thailand's restive south
in the first protest against the restriction.


They complained the curfew, which was imposed by the military
last month in the wake of the massacre of nine Buddhists by
suspected Islamic rebels, affected their economic activities.


"We are suffering from the curfew because we cannot go out and
tap rubber trees to earn money," one male protester told AFP.


The military imposed the curfew in the two districts of Yaha and
Bannang Sata in Yala province, one of three insurgency-plagued
provinces bordering Malaysia, after the grisly daylight killings.


The massacre shocked the nation and highlighted the escalating
violence in the troubled region despite a series of peace efforts
by the government, which came to power after a September coup.


The protest, which included children, lasted a few hours in the
district of Bannang Sata.


Thailand is the world's largest producer of natural rubber, an
industry centered in the restive south where more than 2,100
people have been killed by near-daily shootings and bombings in
the three-year insurgency.


Rubber trees must be tapped in the coolness of the pre-dawn
hours, but the protesters complain the curfew from 9:00 pm to
4:00 am virtually halted vital economic activities for rubber
workers.


The three troubled provinces were once an autonomous sultanate,
until the region was annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a
century ago. Separatist unrest has erupted periodically ever
since.
