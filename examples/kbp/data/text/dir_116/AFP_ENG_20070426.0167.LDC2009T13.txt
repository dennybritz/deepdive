Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said the Afghan government is
losing the war against the Taliban because of inaction, in
remarks published in Spanish daily El Pais on Thursday.


"Those who do nothing against terrorism, like (Afghan President
Hamid) Karzai, are also the ones who criticize those who are
fighting, like us," Musharraf told the paper.


Musharraf and Karzai, two key allies of the US, are to meet in
Turkey next week following Kabul's claims that Islamabad is
either failing to tackle or is actively fostering a growing
Taliban insurgency.


"Those who say that the ISI (Pakistani military intelligence)
helps the Taliban because we want a weak Afghanistan are liars,"
Musharraf said.


"They say these things to hide their shame because they are
losing the war against the Taliban."


Musharraf said Pakistan had 80,000 troops stationed on the
frontier with Afghanistan to stop insurgents crossing.


Pakistan's plans to fence part of the border have angered
Afghanistan.   Last Thursday Kabul said its troops had torn down
some fencing and clashed with Pakistani soldiers.


Pakistan was one of three countries that recognised the harsh
Taliban regime in the late 1990s, but later supported the US-led
invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 attacks on
the United States.
