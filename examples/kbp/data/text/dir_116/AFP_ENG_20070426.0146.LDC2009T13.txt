South African president Thabo Mbeki on Thursday congratulated
Umaru Yar'Adua on winning Nigeria's election which international
monitors and many Nigerians consider to have been deeply flawed.


In his congratulatory letter, Mbeki said he hoped South Africa
and Nigeria could work together more closely "to build a better
Africa and world".


He also called on Nigerian voters, political parties and
candidates "to use exclusively peaceful and constitutional means
to seek redress to any electoral grievances that may arise".


Nigeria's election, held Saturday, was marred by fraud and
violence according to many foreign observers and Nigerians.


On Wednesday a wide opposition coalition urged Nigerians to take
to the streets peacefully next week to force the cancellation of
the vote, but many now see the courts as the only institution
capable of standing up to the government on the issue.
