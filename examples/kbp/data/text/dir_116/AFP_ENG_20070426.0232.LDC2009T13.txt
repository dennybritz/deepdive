An Indian judge ordered the arrest of Hollywood star Richard Gere
and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty on Thursday over a hug and
kiss at an AIDS awareness event.


The arrest warrants were issued in the Rajasthan state capital of
Jaipur following a public interest plea filed last week by
resident Poonam Chand Bhandari accusing the pair of obscenity,
court officials said.


"Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Dinesh Gupta issued the
(arrest) orders," a court official told AFP from Jaipur, 375
kilometres (232 miles) from Jodhpur.
