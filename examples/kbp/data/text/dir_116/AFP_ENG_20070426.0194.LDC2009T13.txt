A grenade was thrown into a house in Indonesia's troubled Ambon
city on Thursday, police said, hours after a bomb attack on a
nearby bus station.


"A grenade hit a house early Thursday but there were no
casualties. The house was near the bus station," a police
spokesman said in Jakarta.


Police are investigating whether pro-independence rebels were
behind the bus station attack in the eastern city, capital of
Ambon island, late on Wednesday.


Nine people waiting for buses were injured, said the spokesman,
Sisno Adiwinoto.


"It is possible that the RMS (rebels) is behind the bus blast.
They may have wanted to coincide it with their anniversary to
announce that they are still there," he said. It was unclear if
they also threw the grenade, he said.


Wednesday marked the 57th anniversary of the claim by outlawed
rebels to an independent South Maluku Republic, a territory
covering the eastern Maluku island chain that includes Ambon.


The separatist movement was crushed shortly after its declaration
in 1950 but the rebels regrouped following the fall of dictator
Suharto in 1998.


Ambon has also been ravaged by clashes between Muslims and
Christians, which erupted in January 1999.


A peace pact in February 2002 mostly ended three years of strife
that left more than 5,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands
homeless.
