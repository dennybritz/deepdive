Slovenian carmaker Revoz, a subsidiary of Renault, presented
Thursday the production line for the French manufacturer's latest
Twingo model, which will be exclusively produced in Novo Mesto.


"Our main concern now is whether we will be able to cope with the
demand of the market," Revoz chief Marcel Brouiller said
Wednesday.


The new production line was presented to journalists Wednesday
and Thursday at the factory in Novo Mesto, some 70 kilometres (40
miles) east of the capital Ljubljana, which already produces the
bigger Renault model Clio II.


The new Twingo was first presented at the Geneva Auto Show in
March and is to go on sale simultaneously in France, Italy and
Slovenia on June 15.


The Novo Mesto factory, which employs some 3,000 workers, has
since February produced 750 cars per day: 525 Clio II and 225 new
Twingo, Brouiller explained.


In May, it will introduce a night shift to increase production to
800 vehicles per day: 400 Clios and 400 Twingos, he added.


Revoz can produce up to 210,000 cars a year.


Renault invested 400 million euros (545 million dollars) to
modernise and adapt the Novo Mesto plant as part of preparations
to produce the new Twingo, and hired an additional 700 workers.


Revoz is Slovenia's largest exporter, representing almost 8.0
percent of all Slovenian exports.
