The Swiss pharmaceutical group Roche said Thursday that it will
trim production of the frontline bird flu drug Tamiflu unless
demand picks up.


Manufacturing capacity for the antiviral has reached 400 million
treatment courses a year and is outstripping demand, William
Burns, the chief executive of the group's pharmaceuticals
division told journalists.


Roche has received orders for 215 million treatments from
governments and private companies, and just 40 million still have
to be fulfilled, he added.


"Today we can satisfy significant additional orders from
governments and corporations, and unless the demand picks up
Roche will be tailoring its production schedule accordingly,"


Burns said Roche could halt production now and still satisfy
current demand.


It will maintain a buffer stock at all times and remain in close
contact with manufacturing partners "to respond speedily to a
surge in demand," he added.


It would take four months to restore production to the current
rate, Burns explained.


Tamiflu has been used extensively to treat human cases of the
most virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu.


Governments and the World Health Organisation have also been
building up stockpiles of the drug to guard against a threatened
global flu pandemic.


Roche faced pressure just over a year ago to boost manufacturing
capacity  amid fears that the drug would be in short supply.


The production network includes eight Roche sites and 19 external
manufacturing partners in 9 different countries around the world.
