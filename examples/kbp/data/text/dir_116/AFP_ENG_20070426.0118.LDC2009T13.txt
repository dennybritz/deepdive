Singapore has proposed jointly developing with Beijing an "eco
city" in China to show how rapid growth can be balanced with
environmental protection, a report said Thursday.


Singapore's former prime minister Goh Chok Tong, who holds the
influential cabinet post of senior minister, raised the idea
during a meeting Wednesday in Beijing with Premier Wen Jiabao,
The Straits Times reported.


State press in China reported Thursday that Wen will head a new
team aimed at ensuring China's environmental goals are met, amid
a rising sense of urgency among officials.


Following the creation of the task force on Wednesday, Wen warned
that China was in grave need of cutting energy consumption and
pollution, and that much tougher action is needed, Xinhua news
agency said.


The Straits Times quoted Goh as saying he suggested to Wen that
"we look at how Singapore has integrated its economic development
with environmental development, sustaining growth while making
the whole city look beautiful."


Wen agreed to the idea in principal, Goh was quoted as saying.


Details of the proposal have not been worked out but Goh said on
Singapore's 938Live radio that "it's going to benefit a city as
well as the two countries' cooperation."


Singapore officials could not immediately comment on the
proposal.


The two countries enjoy close bilateral ties and leading
Singapore companies have a strong presence in China.


The city-state said last Friday that it is aiming to become a
centre for research in environmental sustainability.
