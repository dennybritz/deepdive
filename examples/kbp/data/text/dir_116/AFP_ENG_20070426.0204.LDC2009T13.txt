Next year's annual state of the nation speech in Russia will be
given by a new president, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday.


"In spring of next year my duties end and the next state of the
nation speech will be delivered by a different head of state,"
Putin said in his state of the nation speech to both houses of
parliament in the Kremlin.


Putin, 54, wrapped up his speech by saying it would be premature
to issue his political testimony, as presidential elections do
not take place until next March 2.


"It wouldn't be appropriate to give an assessment of one's own
activities here and it's premature for me to issue my political
testimony," Putin said.


Putin is obliged to stand down after the presidential election as
the constitution prevents anyone from holding the post for more
than two terms in a row.


Putin gave no indication of who he thought might be a suitable
successor.


He has previously insisted that Russians will have a free choice
at democratic elections, although he has said that he has the
right to express his own preference.


The two men considered the most likely candidates, first deputy
prime ministers Sergei Ivanov and Dmitry Medvedev, sat at the
front of the hall listening attentively.


Critics accuse the Kremlin of preparing to stage manage the
election process.


There have been numerous calls for Putin to stay on in office,
reflecting his continued high ratings in opinion polls.
