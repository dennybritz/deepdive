Ray Ranson has stepped up his bid to secure control of Manchester
City by submitting revised takeover proposals to the Premiership
club.


City have so far rebuffed approaches from their former defender
and both an American-based consortium and former Thai premier
Thaksin Shinawatra are reported to be watching developments
closely.


Ranson claimed his revised proposal addresses the issues raised
by the current City board and called for a face-to-face meeting
with current chairman John Wardle to thrash out a deal.


"I first contacted City in 2004, long before I was associated
with a move for Aston Villa," Ranson said. "Now I have the
financial backing to be successful.


"City have huge potential, on and off the pitch. I believe I am
in a unique position to drive that forward having played the game
at the top level and then never left it."


If Ranson does succeed in his takeover move, the future of
manager Stuart Pearce will be in doubt. The businessman has
refused to confirm that Pearce will be kept on if he is in
charge.


Speculation over the future ownership of City has been rife since
Wardle announced last month that he wanted to sell his 29 percent
stake, which is owned jointly with business partner David Makin.


So far there has been no sign of a deal being concluded although
the chairman has been involved in talks with the unnamed American
consortium for nearly a month.
