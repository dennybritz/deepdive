Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that foreign money
was being used to interfere in Russia's affairs under the pretext
of spreading democracy.


"The flow of money from abroad is used for direct interference in
our affairs," Putin said in his annual state of the nation
address, accusing unnamed forces of using "democratic slogans" to
secure their own interests.
