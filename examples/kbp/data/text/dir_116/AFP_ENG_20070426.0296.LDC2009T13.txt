first-quarter net profit had fallen to 590 million euros (803
million dollars) from 743 million euros a year earlier,
outstripping analysts forecasts of 450 million euros.


Operating profit fell to 880 million euros from 960 million,

Commerzbank is scheduled to publish full first-quarter earnings
figures on May 9.
