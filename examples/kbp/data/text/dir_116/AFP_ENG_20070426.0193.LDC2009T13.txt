The US military on Thursday said a senior officer in command of a
prison in Iraq has been detained and will be investigated for a
series of offences, including that of aiding the enemy.


Lieutenant Colonel William H. Steele is accused of having aided
the "enemy by providing an unmonitored cellular phone to
detainees" held at Camp Cropper and of wrongfully fraternizing
with the daughter of a prisoner.
