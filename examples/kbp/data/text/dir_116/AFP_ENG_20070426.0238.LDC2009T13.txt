Ethiopian forces on Thursday seized control of insurgent
strongholds in northern Mogadishu after some of the heaviest
fighting in the city's history, residents and the Somali prime
minister said.


"We have nearly concluded the fighting in Mogadishu against Al
Qaeda insurgents and we are now chasing them away," Prime
Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi told a press conference in the capital.


"We hope to completely conclude the war tomorrow, and government
forces will secure the capital," he added.


Residents said Ethiopian forces had seized control of northern
Mogadishu's main Balad checkpoint, a vital supply line for
insurgent enclaves in the city.


"We saw more than 10 tanks and infantry troops pouring into
northern Mogadishu this morning," said Mohamed Jeele, a resident
of Suuqahoola area.


"I believe the Ethiopian forces broke insurgent positions in
Tawfiq and Ramadan areas and then moved further north," he added.


The seizure gave the Ethiopians the upper hand in the latest
nine-day-old battle, which has claimed several hundred lives and
displaced up to 400,000 people.


"We call on the militias who have been misled to surrender and no
one will take revenge on them," Gedi said.


Ethiopian forces were still carrying out sporadic shelling on
insurgent positions after reports of heavy bombardment earlier in
the day.


Residents said the insurgents had halted face-to-face battles
after the Ethiopian bombardment and were believed to be
regrouping in several residential areas devastated by the
clashes.
