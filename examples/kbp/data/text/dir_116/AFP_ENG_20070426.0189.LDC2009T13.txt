Shiite militants of Hezbollah erected a large photograph of two
Israeli soldiers it is holding on Lebanon's border with the
Jewish state Thursday, an AFP correspondent saw.


A crowd of the group's supporters chanted slogans as the three-
metre by five- metre (10 foot by 16 foot) photograph was put up
in this border district near where the soldiers were seized.


It was not immediately clear when the photograph was taken of the
two soldiers, whose seizure in a deadly cross-border raid sparked
last summer's devastating Lebanon war.


Mounted on a huge black placard, the photograph shows the two
soldiers in profile facing each other.
