Two Filipinos have been rewarded 85,000 dollars by the US
government for information which led to the killing of two
leaders of the militant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf, the US embassy
said Thursday.


One of the dead, Binang Sali, was a suspect in the abduction of a
group of tourists, including three Americans, at an island resort
in the western Philippines in 2001.


Two of the Americans died in captivity while a third was rescued
13 months later.


The unnamed informants "stood against terrorism and provided
information that was instrumental in allowing the Armed Forces of
the Philippines to track Abu Sayyaf group leaders" Jumdan Jamalul
and Sali, an embassy statement said.


Jamalul, known as "Black Killer," was killed by Philippine troops
in a clash at sea off the southwestern Tawi-Tawi island group on
January 6.


Sali, also known as "Commander Freedom," died in a firefight with
the military three days later.


Philippine authorities say Jamalul was a suspect in an Abu Sayyaf
raid on the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan in April 2000 when
21 Asians and Europeans were kidnapped and taken across the sea
border to Sulu in a year-long hostage crisis.


The US "Rewards for Justice" programme offers monetary rewards to
civilians worldwide who provide information to their national
militaries in their fight against terrorism, the embassy
statement said.
