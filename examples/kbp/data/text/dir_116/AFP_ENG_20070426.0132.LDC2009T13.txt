The body of a US Peace Corps volunteer was cremated in Manila
Thursday as Philippine police prepared criminal charges against a
local woodcarver being hunted for her murder.


The ceremony was held under tight security eight days after the
battered body of Julia Campbell was discovered in a shallow grave
in the northern Philippines.


Campbell, 40, disappeared on April 8 after she went trekking
alone near the village of Batad. She was apparently beaten around
the head and body before being buried.


Police have identified Batad woodcarver Juan Dontugan, 25, as the
prime suspect. Murder charges will be filed against him within
the next four days, regional police spokesman Superintendent
Joseph Adnol said.


Dontugan went into hiding hours after Campbell's body was found
and is now being hunted by police and local hill tribesmen.


Police earlier said they recovered a pair of blood-stained
trousers believed to be Dontugan's. A piece of wood believed to
have been the murder weapon and a crowbar were also recovered.


The victim had worked as a volunteer teacher in impoverished
villages in the Philippines for the past two years. She
previously lived in New York, where she worked as a freelance
journalist for publications including the New York Times.


Campbell was last seen buying a soft drink at a store owned by
Dontogan's wife. Officers say that robbery was the most likely
motive for the crime.
