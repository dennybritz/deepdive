Outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo, facing criticism at home
and abroad over Nigeria's flawed presidential poll, told AFP he
had no problem with planned opposition protests provided they
were orderly.


"If you want to demonstrate, demonstration is part of democracy,
provided it does not lead to disorderliness," he said in an
interview late Wednesday.


Earlier on Wednesday, a broad opposition coalition, as well as
civil society groups, announced mass action next week to demand
the cancellation of polls which foreign monitors from the
European Union, the United States and other rights groups said
were marred by massive fraud and violence.


But Obasanjo, who himself admitted the elections were far from
perfect in a national address, waved aside the criticism.


"Some of them came with their own prejudices," he said of the
bevy of foreign condemnations of state, parliamentary and
presidential polls held April 14 and 21.


Instead, he said, delays in getting ballots to Nigeria's 65
million voters on time for the presidential poll last Saturday
were caused by circumstances beyond the government's control.


Just days before Nigerians were to cast their votes for a
successor to Obasanjo, the Supreme Court ruled that a leading
candidate, Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Obasanjo's onetime
friend-turned-foe, could vote despite corruption charges.


"The outcome of the election, to me, is a true reflection of the
situation," he said.
