Up to 400,000 people have fled fighting in Somalia's capital
Mogadishu, the UN's humanitarian chief said Thursday, warning
that aid had reached less than a fifth of the refugees.


The United Nations refugee agency said last Friday that an
estimated 321,000 Somalis had fled Mogadishu since the beginning
of February, based on monitoring by local agencies.


"I think these estimates are rising rapidly... We're probably
nearer 340,000 or 350,000 now, I've even seen a figure of
400,000," UN Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs John
Holmes told journalists.


"The latest estimate was that we probably had access to around
60,000 of those who fled," he added, warning that the situation
in Mogadishu was "critical".


Aid agencies have reported columns of people and chaotic scenes
on roads out of the capital, rising illness and a shortage of
food and water for the displaced.


Civilians left in Mogadishu braved unrelenting shelling and
machinegun fire as Ethiopians forces and Islamist guerrillas
battled for the ninth consecutive day, setting buildings ablaze.
