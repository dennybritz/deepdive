Shiite militants of Hezbollah erected a large photograph of two
Israeli soldiers it is holding on Lebanon's border with the
Jewish state Thursday, an AFP correspondent saw.


A crowd of the group's supporters chanted slogans as the three-
metre by five- metre (10 foot by 16 foot) photograph was put up
in this border district near where the soldiers were seized.


The photograph was a montage of old pictures already circulated
in Israel of the two men in civilian clothes before their capture
in the deadly July raid that sparked last summer's devastating
Lebanon war.


Mounted on a huge black placard draped in a Hezbollah flag, the
photograph showed Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev in profile
facing each other.


Between them was the legend in English and Arabic -- "For the
sake of our detainees", a reference to Hezbollah's demands to
exchange them for prisoners held by Israel.


The dozen or so Hezbollah militants who erected the photograph
were unarmed.


Chants in support of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah rang out
from the crowd of local villagers who gathered to watch it put
up. "We will sacrifice ourselves for you, Nasrallah," they
shouted.


A patrol from the UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL monitored the
event, as did an Israeli patrol on the other side of the border.
