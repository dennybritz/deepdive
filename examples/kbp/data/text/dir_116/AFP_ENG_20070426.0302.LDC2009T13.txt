Former Portugal star Eusebio said he was feeling well Thursday
after leaving hospital, where he had been held since Saturday.


The 'Black Panther' as he was known in his playing days,
underwent surgery on his carotid arteries on Monday after
suffering from a blockage of the arteries that carry blood to the
brain.


But upon leaving Lisbon's Hospital of Light he told reporters: "I
feel fine. I hope to be fully recovered in a week."


Eusebio hails originally from former Portuguese colony Mozambique
and lit up the 1966 World Cup, scoring nine goals as Portugal
reached the semi-finals.


He was a major star for Benfica during the 1960s and 1970s,
winning 10 titles, five cups and one European Cup, whilst also
playing in three other finals of Europe's top competition.
