Ethiopian rebels holding seven Chinese oil workers captured
during an attack on a Chinese oil venture in Ethiopia said
Thursday they would release them "as soon as possible".


"They are very well. We are planning to release them to the ICRC
(International Committee for the Red Cross), we'll do that as
soon possible when the proper arrangements are done," said
Abderahmane Mahdi, a spokesman for the Ogaden National Liberation
Front.


"The situation is very complex because Ethiopia will take any
advantage to kill them and to blame us," he told AFP by telephone
from London.


It is "a very delicate operation, because Ogaden is a battle
zone," he added.


The Ogaden National Liberation Front separatist group claimed
responsibility for Tuesday's dawn attack on a Chinese oil venture
in Ogaden, where the ONLF is fighting for the independence of
ethnic Somalis.


The Chinese embassy in Ethiopia expressed hope Thursday for the
release of the seven Chinese seized in the attack in which 77
people died, including nine Chinese.


"We're hoping that they'll be released soon. There are some good
signs but I can't tell you more," embassy spokeswoman Sun Qing
told AFP.


Ethiopia has sent an investigation team to the oil site in its
remote eastern region.


Authorities in Somali region, which includes Ogaden, decreed two
days of mourning starting Thursday in memory of victims of the
attack.
