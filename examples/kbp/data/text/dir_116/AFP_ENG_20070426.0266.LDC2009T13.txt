Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Thursday that
Palestinian government divisions made talks between the two sides
difficult but stressed the need to achieve peace.


"The problem with the Palestinians is that they have a united
government from the administrative point of view but a divided
government from the political point of view," Peres said on a
visit to Croatia.


"That makes it very very difficult to negotiate," he told
journalists when asked to comment about the Middle East peace
process.


Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was meeting Palestinian
President Mahmud Abbas "every second week," said Peres, adding he
hoped "from those meetings something may emerge positively."


Unlike efforts with the Palestinians and Lebanon, Israel had
achieved peace with Egypt and Jordan due to the political and
military unity of the two countries, added Peres.


"The Palestinians and the Lebanese have many governments and no
government, and many armies and no army, and that is why it is
difficult to make peace.


"But we will not give up. We should continue to try our best to
achieve peace," he stressed.


Peres, a Nobel peace laureate, arrived in Croatia earlier on
Thursday for a two- day visit to further boost Israel's ties with
the former Yugoslav republic.
