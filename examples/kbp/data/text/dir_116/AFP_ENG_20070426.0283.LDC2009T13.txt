The official campaign for parliamentary elections in Algeria
opened on Thursday, three weeks ahead of the vote, amid calls for
vigilance after deadly attacks in Algiers this month.


Nearly 19 million registered voters are to elect 389 deputies in
the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, on May 17.


State of emergency rules have been in force in Algeria since
December 1991 parliamentary elections were cancelled after being
won by the Islamist FIS party, prompting a civil war.


Algeria's election commission called for vigilance on Thursday
"to counter any criminal attempts to disrupt the election"
following April 11 car bomb attacks by Islamists.


The attacks, claimed by an Al-Qaeda affiliate, claimed 30 lives
and injured more than 200.


All political rallies must be authorised beforehand and be held
in "closed and secure venues", and only exceptionally outdoors,
the interior ministry said.


A national election monitoring commission will be headed by
former supreme court president Said Bouchair.


The Front of Socialist Force, headed by Hocing Ait Ahmed, called
for a boycott of the vote.
