EU regulators approved on Thursday Hilton Hotels' sale of its
Scandinavian hotels chain Scandic to Swedish private equity fund
EQT.


"After examining the operation, the (European) Commission
concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede
effective competition," the EU antitrust watchdog said in a
statement.


Hilton Hotels announced in March that it would sell Scandic for
833 million euros (1.1 billion dollars) to EQT, which is
controlled by Northern Europe's biggest industrial holding
company Investor.


Scandic is the biggest hotel operator in Scandinavia with 132.
