Diversified conglomerate Keppel Corp, the world's biggest maker
of oil rigs, reported on Thursday a 48.2 percent rise in
quarterly net profit compared with a year earlier.


Net profit was 251.62 million Singapore dollars (167 million US)
for the three months to March 31 compared with 169.83 million
dollars last year, Keppel said.


Group revenue was 2.03 billion dollars, 31.4 percent higher than
the 1.54 billion dollars in the same period last year, it said.


Three-quarters of group revenue came from the offshore and marine
division, whose order book of 10 billion dollars is expected to
contribute significantly to future results, the company said.


"The fundamentals of the industry remain robust, underpinned by
firm crude oil prices and depleting global reserves," it said.


Keppel's executive chairman, Lim Chee Onn, said that Group
earnings will become more broad-based, with higher contributions
from property and infrastructure this year.


He said Keppel has become the largest developer and operator of
prime office space in Singapore.


"The good start in the first quarter has put the Group in a
strong position to achieve its earnings target of a double-digit
growth rate for the current year," Keppel said.
