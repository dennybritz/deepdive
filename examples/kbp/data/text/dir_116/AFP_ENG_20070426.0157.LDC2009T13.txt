An EU court ruled on Thursday that regulators had erred in their
judgement against two companies in a cartel of papermakers and
ordered their fines to be reduced.


In December 2001, the European Commission ordered 10 companies to
pay 313.7 million euros (428.0 million dollars) for a cartel in
the carbonless paper market in what was at the time the second-
biggest penalty against a trust.


However, the 10 companies lodged an appeal with the European
Court of First Instance, hoping to get the EU competition
watchdog's decision overturned or the fines reduced.


The court ruled that British company Arjo Wiggins Appelton
deserved a lower fine because it was more cooperative with
trustbusters than credited and ordered its penalty to be cut to
141.7 million euros from 184.2 million euros.


It also ruled that regulators failed to prove that Spanish firm
Zicunaga divvied up the market with other companies as it was
accused and ordered that its fine be reduced to 1.3 million euros
from 1.5 million euros.


The two reductions brought the combined fines for the whole
cartel down to 270.9 million euros from 313.7 million euros
originally.
