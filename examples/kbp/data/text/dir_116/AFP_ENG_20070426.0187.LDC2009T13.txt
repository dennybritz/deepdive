Two children were killed and four others injured when a grenade
they found in a garbage dump exploded as they played with it,
police said Thursday.


Robert San Andres, 8, and Liza Legacion, 12, were killed in the
blast while four other members of San Andres' family were
severely injured, they said.


The children had gone into a dumpsite earlier and found the
grenade, which they brought to the San Andres' home to play with,
Senior Superintendent Romeo Mapalo told reporters.
