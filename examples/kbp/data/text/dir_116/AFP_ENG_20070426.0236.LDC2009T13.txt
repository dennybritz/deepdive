Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant, said on
Thursday that first-quarter net profit more than quadrupled
thanks to one-time gains from asset sales.


Net profit shot up to 2.8 billion euros (3.8 billion dollars)
from 600 million euros, boosted by a gain of nearly 2.2 billion
euros from the divestment of the diagnostics business, and of
specialist metals business HC Starck, it said.


Over the period operating profit increased by 17 percent to 1.4
billion euros and sales by 24 percent to 8.3 billion euros.


Bayer had not been scheduled to publish its results on Thursday,
but did so conform with a German law under which companies are
obliged to publish their figures when they are much higher than
analysts' expectations.
