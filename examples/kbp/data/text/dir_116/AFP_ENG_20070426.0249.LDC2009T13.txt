Danish cabin crews at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) entered
their third day of strike action on Thursday, cancelling most SAS
flights in and out of Copenhagen, SAS Denmark said.


Another 149 European and intercontinental flights were cancelled
until 1200 GMT Thursday, the airline added in a statement on
their website.


The cabin staff walked off the job on Tuesday in what the Danish
labour court ruled to be an illegal strike.


In total the three day strike has so far cancelled 552 SAS
flights costing the airline millions of kronor, Danish media
reported.


SAS was already hit last month by a similar strike after the
airline failed to reach a collective agreement with the
1,600-member Cabin Attendants Union.


The parties were set to meet again Thursday but according to
union chair Verner Lundtoft Hansen staff will not return to their
jobs until they have reached a satisfactory agreement with the
airline.


"We are protesting against poor working conditions. Staff want to
be able to influence the planning of holidays and days off,"
Hansen told Danish news agency Ritzau.


Some 15,000-20,000 passengers were estimated to have been hit by
the strike.
