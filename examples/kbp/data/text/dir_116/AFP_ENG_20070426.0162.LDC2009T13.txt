MySpace announced its launch in China Thursday, following months
of speculation about the Rupert Murdoch-controlled social
networking site's plans for the nation's 137 million Internet
users.


MySpace China introduced itself as a "locally owned, operated and
managed company" in which News Corp-owned Myspace Inc was only
one among several investors.


"Based on the MySpaced global brand and technology platform, we
will develop products and features that are tailored to today's
Chinese citizens," said MySpace China CEO Luo Chuan, a former
Microsoft executive.


Other investors include International Data Group and China
Broadband Capital Partners, the investment company of former
China Netcom Group Corp chief executive Edward Tian.


Luo declined at a briefing to give specific details about the
size of the investment or the share that MySpace Inc accounts
for.


The MySpace China community is still in its test stage, adapted
from the US version, but will gradually be developed to meet the
needs of Chinese users, the company said.


Negotiations have been in progress since News Corp chairman
Murdoch announced last October that he would bring MySpace to
China, according to earlier reports.
