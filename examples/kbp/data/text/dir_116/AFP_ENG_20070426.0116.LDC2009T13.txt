Syria's ruling National Progressive Front romped to victory
Thursday in parliamentary elections in which the only challenge
came from independents.


The front, which is dominated by the Baath party of President
Bashar al-Assad, took 172 seats, five more than the 167 reserved
for it under the constitution, according to official results
announced by Interior Minister Bassam Abdel-Majid.


The other 78 seats up for grabs in the weekend's two-day
elections went to independents.


The front has won every election since its formation in 1973. The
Baath party has ruled Syria under a state of emergency ever since
it seized power in 1963.


In the outgoing parliament, the front held only its minimum
reserved quota of 167 seats.
