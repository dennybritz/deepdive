Former Germany boss Juergen Klinsmann has accepted a job with
German TV, apparently ruling himself out of becoming coach of
English Premiership champions Chelsea, a report said on Thursday.


Klinsmann will work for as an analyst and commentator for pay-TV
channel Arena for the next two years, Bild newspaper reported.


He will fly to Germany from his home in California for major
Bundesliga games, the report said.


"I had many offers after the World Cup to return to Europe, but
Arena is the first partner that has really won me over,"
Klinsmann said, quoted by Bild.


It has been reported this month that Chelsea's billionaire
Russian owner Roman Abramovich has approached Klinsmann with a
view to him replacing Jose Mourinho, but the Portuguese coach
appears to have patched up his differences with Abramovich.


Klinsmann, 42, led host nation Germany to the semi-finals of last
year's World Cup, moulding a young and relatively unfancied squad
into an exciting attacking team.


But he stepped down immediately after the tournament, saying he
did not want to uproot his family and his American wife from the
United States.


As a player, Klinsmann helped Germany win the 1990 World Cup and
played for Bayern Munich, Inter Milan and Tottenham.
