The US military said Thursday that a senior officer in command of
a prison camp in Iraq had been detained and will be investigated
for a series of offences, including that of aiding the enemy.


Lieutenant Colonel William H. Steele is accused of having aided
the "enemy by providing an unmonitored cellular phone to
detainees" held at Camp Cropper and of wrongfully fraternizing
with the daughter of a prisoner.


Earlier, a US military spokeswoman told AFP that Steele had been
detained in Kuwait and would face a panel of officers who would
decide whether there is enough evidence for him to face a court
martial.


Steele is also accused of having unauthorised possession of
classified information, maintained an improper relationship with
an Iraqi interpreter, failing to obey an order and of possessing
pornographic videos.


The charge sheet also accused him of "wilfully failing to fulfil
obligations as an approving authority in the expenditure of
funds."
