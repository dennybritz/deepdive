At least 20 unexploded bombs have been discovered at Kalemegdan
Fortress, one of the Serbian capital's major tourist attractions,
a daily reported Thursday.


The bombs were "82 mm calibre mortar shells dating from World War
II," archeologist Marko Popovic told the Blic newspaper.


The shells were uncovered during the reconstruction of ruined
ramparts of the old fortress at the confluence of the Danube and
Sava rivers in central Belgrade.


Special police teams that came to remove the bombs established
that some of the weapons were live as they still had detonators.


Belgrade was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941 and liberated by
the Soviet Red Army in October 1944.
