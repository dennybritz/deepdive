The family of Sri Lanka's master blaster opening batsman Sanath
Jayasuriya was set to join him in Bridgetown for Saturday's final
with Australia.


Jayasuriya's wife Sandra and three young children were due to
leave later Thursday for London en route to Barbados, a family
friend told AFP.


Jayasuriya, player of the series in the 1996 World Cup which Sri
Lanka won, is a vital cog in the Sri Lankan batting machine.


With his failure in the semi-final against New Zealand when he
was bowled for one by James Franklin, the explosive left-hander's
form will be crucial to Sri Lanka's chances against Australia.


One of the world's most destructive batsmen on his day,
Jayasuriya has hit centuries against Bangladesh and host West
Indies in the current World Cup.


Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapakse also made a previously
unscheduled visit to Barbados on Thursday to witness his country
play Australia in the finals.
