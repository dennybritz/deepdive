Three men belonging to one of Saudi Arabia's biggest clans were
beheaded in the capital on Thursday after being convicted of
banditry and murder, the official SPA news agency reported.


"Mohammed bin Maktub bin Mesfer al-Jaffarin al-Dussari, Saad bin
Mubarak bin Salal al-Jaffarin al-Dussari and Meshlah bin Mubarak
bin Mohammed al-Belhasan al-Dussari belonged to "a band of
criminals dedicated to banditry... and the spilling of blood,"
with one murder victim being Pakistani Nayaz Khan Shah, said an
interior ministry statement published by SPA.


The latest beheadings bring to 44 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia,
or Islamic law. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug
trafficking can all carry the death penalty.
