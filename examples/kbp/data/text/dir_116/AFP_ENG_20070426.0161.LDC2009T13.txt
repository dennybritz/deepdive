China said it welcomed Thursday's agreement between Myanmar and
North Korea to restore diplomatic ties, but stayed silent on
whether it played any role in the deal.


"The DPRK (North Korea) and Myanmar are friendly neighbours of
China," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told journalists
at a press briefing.


"We are happy to see and welcome the improvement of their
bilateral ties."


Military-run Myanmar and communist North Korea, two of the
world's most secretive nations, agreed earlier Thursday in Yangon
to restore diplomatic relations after more than two decades of
severed ties.


Myanmar deputy foreign minister Kyaw Thu made the announcement
after meeting for about an hour with his counterpart from North
Korea, Kim Yong-Il.


China's ambassador to Myanmar, Guan Mu, was seen with them as
they left the meeting.


While the United States has branded both Myanmar and North Korea
"outposts of tyranny", China has maintained close ties with them.


At a regular foreign ministry briefing, Liu made only brief
remarks about the restoration of Myanmar-North Korea ties and did
not say whether China played any role in the deal.
