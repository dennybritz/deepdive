Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday he supported plans
to create a state "Russian language fund" to protect and promote
Russian language and literature.


"Russian is the historic language of brotherhood among peoples
and international society, the repository of world achievements
and the living space for the multi-million strong Russian world,"
Putin said in his state of the nation speech.


Creation of a Russian language fund, an idea supported by
linguists in the country, would help promote the spread of
Russian language and literature in the world, Putin said, adding:
"Russian will never be a language of conflict."
