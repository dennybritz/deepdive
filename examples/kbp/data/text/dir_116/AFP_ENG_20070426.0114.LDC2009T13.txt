Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres arrived Thursday in
Croatia to discuss ties between the two countries which had been
frosty during Zagreb's nationalist regime in the 1990s.


Peres was to meet Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, President Stipe
Mesic and is to give a lecture at the Croatian Academy of
Sciences and Arts.


Before leaving Croatia on Friday, he is to travel to the southern
coastal town of Split.


Peres is the highest Israeli official to visit Croatia since
President Moshe Katsav came to the Balkan country in 2003.


Relations between the two were strained during the 1990s rule of
Croatia's late autocratic president Franjo Tudjman, whom Israel
accused of failing to make a strong denunciation of Croatia's
pro-Nazi World War II regime.


An estimated 75 percent of Croatia's 40,000 Jews were murdered by
the wartime regime.


Ties have improved since Stipe Mesic, a centrist, succeeded
Tudjman as president in 2000.
