British actor Hugh Grant has been arrested for assault after
allegedly hurling a container of baked beans at a photographer,
according to an online report Thursday.


"A 46-year-old man was arrested in connection with allegations of
assault on a 43-year-old man following an incident" in west
London on Tuesday, police said without identifying the man.


"He has been bailed to return pending further inquiries," said a
spokeswoman for the British capital's Metropolitan Police told
AFP when asked about the reported arrest.


Online news site The Daily Snack said the photographer alleged he
was physically attacked by Grant, who then threw a takeaway
container of baked beans at him.
