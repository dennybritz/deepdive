Ethiopian rebels holding seven Chinese oil workers captured
during an attack on a Chinese oil venture in Ethiopia said they
would release them "as soon as possible".


"They are very well. We are planning to release them to the ICRC
(International Committee for the Red Cross), we'll do that as
soon possible when the proper arrangements are done," said
Abderahmane Mahdi, a spokesman for the Ogaden National Liberation
Front.


"The situation is very complex because Ethiopia will take any
advantage to kill them and to blame us," he told AFP by telephone
from London.
