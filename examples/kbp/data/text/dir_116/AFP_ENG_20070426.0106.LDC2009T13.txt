Nintendo said Thursday its net profit grew by more than two-
thirds in the last fiscal year thanks to strong sales of its
next-generation Wii video game console and its handheld machines.


Nintendo Co. Ltd. said its net profits grew to 174.3 billion yen
(1.47 billion dollars) in the 12 months to March, up 77.2
percent.


Operating income shot up two and a half times to 226 billion yen,
with revenue rising nearly 90 percent to 966.5 billion yen.


Nintendo, which has long dominated handheld machines, said it had
reversed a long decline in the market for portable consoles by
introducing games that appeal to new demographic groups such as
women and the elderly.


It said it enjoyed strong sales both for its double-screen
Nintendo DS and its next-generation Wii, known for its innovative
motion-sensitive controller.


"The video game industry is now on a growth path with strong
performances in both Nintendo DS and Wii," the Kyoto-based
company said in a statement.
