Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz has payed out nearly
400,000 dollars in blood money to spare the life of a convicted
murderer who had spent 18 years on death row, a report said
Thursday.


The prince, who is also defence minister, payed the money to the
family of the murder victim, Ismail Ali al-Zahrani, to spare the
life of his killer Salah Mussaed al-Zahrani, the Al-Watan daily
said.


Zahrani, who was held in a prison in the western town of Al-Baha,
had spent longer on death row than any other convict in the
kingdom, the paper said.


His detention had lasted so long because the the victim's son
Othman needed to reach adulthood in order to decide whether to
accept the payment to spare his life, it added.


Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia applies a strict form of sharia,
or Islamic law. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug
trafficking can all carry the death penalty and at least 37
people were executed last year.


But convicts can be spared if the victim's family agrees to
accept the payment of blood money, or diya in Arabic, instead.
