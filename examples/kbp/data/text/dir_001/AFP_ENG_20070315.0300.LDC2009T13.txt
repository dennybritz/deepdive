The British government on Thursday estimated the cost of hosting
the 2012 Olympics in London at 9.3 billion pounds (18 billion
dollars), nearly four times initial projections.


When Britain won the Olympics in 2005, the Games were expected to
cost 2.4 billion pounds.


In a statement on the funding of the Games, Culture Minister
Tessa Jowell told the House of Commons that two thirds of the
cost of the games -- six billion pounds -- would be provided by
central government.
