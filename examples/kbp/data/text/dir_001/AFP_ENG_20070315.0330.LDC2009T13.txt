The Swiss central bank said on Thursday that it was raising its
key Libor interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a
range between 1.75 percent and 2.75 percent.


The Swiss National Bank said in a statement that its move was
aimed at curbing stronger inflation expected from the middle of
the year.
