The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in its
monthly report on Thursday that world oil demand would grow by
1.5 percent in 2007 from the level last year.


"World oil demand growth for 2007 is forecast to grow by 1.3 mb/d
(million barrels per day) or 1.5 percent, an upward revision of
0.1 mb/d" compared with OPEC's forecast in February.
