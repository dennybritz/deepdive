A Paris court Thursday sentenced French national Willie Brigitte
to nine years in jail for conspiring with Pakistani extremists to
plot terrorist attacks in Australia.


Brigitte, 38, showed no emotion as the verdict was read out in
the Paris criminal court.


Deported from Australia in 2003, the 38-year-old from the French
Caribbean island of Guadeloupe went on trial last month on
charges of "criminal conspiracy in relation with a terrorist
enterprise."
