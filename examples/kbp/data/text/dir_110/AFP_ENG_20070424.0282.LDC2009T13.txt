Deputies of the main DR Congo opposition parties met on Tuesday
to discuss a possible return to parliament, which they have
boycotted because of security concerns, an AFP journalist said.


The parliamentary groups of opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba's
Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC), of the Christian Democrats
and of the Order of Democratic Republicans met in separate rooms
in the parliament building.


The meetings come three days after the government ended its
occupation of Bemba's party headquarters put in place after
deadly clashes last month.


MLC headquarters had been ransacked by the military after clashes
on March 22 and 23. Radio and television stations owned by Bemba
were also looted.


MLC lawmakers walked out of parliament earlier this month over
security concerns and are currently in negotiations to return to
the legislature.


The clashes between the Congolese army and Bemba's guard resulted
in between 200 and 500 deaths, according to diplomatic sources.
Fighting broke out after Bemba, an arch-rival of President Joseph
Kabila, refused to have his guard integrated into the regular
army.


Bemba, a failed presidential candidate, had been holed up in the
South African embassy since the clashes until leaving for
Portugal, officially for medical treatment.


The DRC's state prosecutor is seeking to have Bemba's immunity
lifted so he can face charges related to last month's clashes.
