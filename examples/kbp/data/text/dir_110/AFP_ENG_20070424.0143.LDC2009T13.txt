Russia said Tuesday it will veto UN Security Council approval of
a plan under consideration for putting Kosovo on the path to
independence, Russian news agencies reported.


Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov said a plan authored by UN
special envoy Martti Ahtisaari to grant the Serbian province
supervised independence was unacceptable because of Serb
opposition.


"The solution based on the recommendation by Ahtisaari will not
pass at the UN Security Council," Titov said.
