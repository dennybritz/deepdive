Poland and Europe are indebted to former Russian president Boris
Yeltsin, Lech Walesa, Poland's first post-Soviet democratically
elected president said Tuesday.


"I don't think the world has yet fully grasped the huge role
Yeltsin played in bringing an end to the Soviet Union," Walesa
told the Rzeczpospolita daily.


Yeltsin died Monday after suffering a heart attack. He was 76.


"I don't suppose he even fully understood how important he was
for Europe. Poland and Europe are indebted to him," said Walesa,
who helped found Solidarity, the first free trade union in the
communist bloc, in 1980.


During his presidency, Walesa negotiated with Yeltsin for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland in 1991.
