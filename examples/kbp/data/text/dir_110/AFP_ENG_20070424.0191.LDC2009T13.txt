Swedish aviation and defence group Saab said on Tuesday first-
quarter pre-tax profit fell sharply on increased marketing,
administration, research and defence costs arising partly from
acquisitions.


Pre-tax profit fell to 380 million kronor (56 million dollars, 39
million euros) from 533 million a year earlier.


"Saab began 2007 solidly. Order bookings and sales increased
compared with the same period last year," group chief Aake
Svensson told reporters.


The equivalent figure last year included 185 million kroner in
extraordinary income, mostly from capital gains, versus 40
million in this quarter results, it said.


Market expectations were for a pre-tax profit of 404 million
kronor, according to SME Direkt.


However sales rose to 4.917 billion kronor from 4.311 billion
kronor.


Orders booked rose to 5.391 billion kronor from 4.149 billion
last year. Saab said that of total order bookings, 72 percent was
attributable to markets outside of Sweden. The order backlog now
stands at 51.4 billion kronor.


Commenting on the allegations that bribery was used to help sell
its Gripen fighter, Saab said the company had never permitted
bribery and that it was fully cooperating with the public
prosecutor's investigation.


Saab reiterated that for 2007, it expects growth in line with
2006, with an operating margin -- including structural costs --
slightly higher than in 2006.
