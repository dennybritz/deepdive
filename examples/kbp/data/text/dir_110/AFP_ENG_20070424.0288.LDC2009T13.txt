Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Kuwait's Emir Sheikh
Sabah al-Ahmad al- Sabah on Tuesday discussed relations between
the two Arab neighbours, state media said.


Maliki arrived from Egypt on a two-day official visit, his second
as prime minister of war-torn Iraq.


State-run KUNA news agency earlier this week quoted a Maliki aide
as saying he premier will urge Kuwait to reopen its embassy in
Baghdad, closed in 1990 when the forces of ousted Iraqi dictator
Saddam Hussein invaded the emirate.


Kuwait has maintained it will reopen its embassy only after the
security situation improves in the Iraqi capital.


Kuwaiti Shiite MP Saleh Ashur urged the government in a statement
to reopen the embassy and support the government in Baghdad
because Iraq's stability is essential to the whole region.


But another MP, Marzuk al-Ghanim, told reporters that it was
premature to reopen the mission because of the security
situation.


The Iraqi premier is also expected to urge oil-rich Kuwait to
implement a decision to forgive most of the debt owed by Iraq,
estimated at around 16 billion dollars.
