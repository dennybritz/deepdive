As Iraqis went on dying violently in large numbers, the deaths of
nine US soldiers in a single incident this week raised the human
cost of the war even further for the US-led coalition.


Here is the approximate death toll both for Iraqis and for
members of the coalition, including countries which have pulled
out since the invasion of March 2003:


- Iraqis: A study by US researchers published in October last
year estimated that some 655,000 Iraqi civilians had died since
the start of the occupation.


A report published a month later by the Iraqi authorities put the
figure at 150,000, while the British web site Iraqbodycount,
based on press reports, puts says the toll is at least 62,300.


The Iraqi security forces say they have lost about 12,000
members.


- Coalition forces overall: 3,598, of whom 92 percent are from
the United States and four percent from Britain.


- United States: 3,330 military personnel, according to an AFP
count based on Pentagon figures.


- Britain: 145


- Italy: 32


- Poland: 20


- Ukraine: 18


- Bulgaria 13


- Spain: 11


- Denmark: six


- El Salvador: five


- Slovakia: four


- Latvia: three


- Estonia: two


- Thailand: two


- The Netherlands: two


- The Czech Republic: one


- Kazakhstan: one


- Australia: one


- Hungary: one


- Romania: one


Of the countries listed, the following have withdrawn all their
forces from Iraq: Spain, Thailand, the Netherlands, Hungary,
Ukraine, Italy and Slovakia.


A number of the foreign troop deaths listed were also due to
accidents and suicides rather than hostile action. The figures do
not include deaths of private security contractors.
