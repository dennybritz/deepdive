Italian cyclist Ivan Basso has been asked to appear before the
Italian Olympic Committee's (Coni) anti-doping prosecutor on May
2, the Ansa news agency said Tuesday.


Prosecutor Ettore Torri and his assistant Franco Cosenza have
called the Tour of Italy champion to appear at their offices in
relation to what they describe as a doping violation regarding
"the use or intent to use a banned substance or method", reported
Ansa.


Basso was kicked off the Tour de France last year after being
implicated in the Spanish Operation Puerto scandal.


That saw him lose his job with Team CSC, although he later joined
Discovery Channel, the former team of seven-time Tour de France
champion Lance Armstrong.


On Monday the International Cycling Union (UCI) put pressure on
Spanish authorities to do more to bring the Operation Puerto to a
conclusion, allowing them to prosecute any dope cheats.
