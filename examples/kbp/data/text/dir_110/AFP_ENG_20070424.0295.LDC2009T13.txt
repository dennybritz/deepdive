Spain is looking at building several offshore wind parks along
its vast coastline as a way to boost its use of renewable energy
sources, an industry ministry spokesman said Tuesday.


The government plans to table a law to allow wind turbines to be
built offshore before the end of the year and it will then
identify the best places where they can be installed, he said.


"This will clearly help Spain to meet the European goal of
producing 20 percent of power production from renewable energy
sources by 2020," he said.


Though more expensive than land-based wind farms, offshore wind
parks can take advantage of stronger, steadier coastal breezes.


But critics fear the parks, which would be located some five
kilometres (three miles) from the coast, would blot the landscape
and hurt fishing.


Spain has some 4,000 kilometres of coastline which draw millions
of sunseekers each year.


The possibility of setting up offshore wind parks in the southern
coastal Cadiz region of southwestern Spain has already been
studied and it is a likely candidate to receive one of the
nation's first such facilities.


The Netherlands opened its first major offshore wind farm earlier
this month and several similar projects are in the works for
Britain, Germany and the United States.


Spain, which along with Germany and Denmark, is among the three
biggest producers of wind power in the 27-nation European Union,
plans to triple the amount of energy it derives from renewable
sources by 2020.
