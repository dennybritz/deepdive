Wikipedia already has thousands of people logging on at their
homes and offices. In Japan, those looking for instant answers
now need look no further than their mobile phones.


A subsidiary of Japanese communications giant NTT on Tuesday
launched the Japanese-language service of the wildly popular free
online encyclopedia for mobile phones.


With the new service from NTT Resonant Communication, surfers of
keywords would receive a hyperlink to a Wikipedia entry.


The page is quickly saved, meaning it can be accessed even
without a connection, such as on a train. The service is not
restricted to only customers of NTT's mobile telephone operator
NTT DoCoMo.


More than 90 percent of Japan's mobile telephone subscribers go
each day to the plethora of online sites available.


In a recent survey, more than half of Japanese who use search
engines on their mobile telephones said they wanted reference
materials of the type of Wikipedia.


Launched in 2001, Wikipedia is written and edited by thousands of
anonymous contributors out of the philosophy that everyone should
have access to information.


But the site, which has more than five million articles in 250
languages, has also come under criticism for information
vandalism.


In one famous case, a former aide to Robert F. Kennedy logged
onto Wikipedia to find an article suggesting that he may have
been involved in the assassinations of both the former US
attorney general Robert F. Kennedy and his older brother
president John F. Kennedy.
