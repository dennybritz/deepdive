Tickets for the 2007 Asian Cup finals went on sale Tuesday via an
online portal, 10 weeks before the event kicks off.


The football showpiece is being co-hosted by Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam with tickets ranging in price from 55 US
dollars for some seats at the final in Jakarta to as little as
three dollars for group games.


"We are delighted to launch our ticket sales to the general
public more than 10 weeks prior to the kick-off of the AFC Asian
Cup," said Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Assistant General
Secretary Clare Kenny Tipton.


"As the event is being held in the four venues, extensive
coordination and planning has been undertaken by AFC with the
four local organising committees.


"We have taken every effort to keep the ticket prices within an
affordable range, and based on ticket enquiries to date, we look
forward to a great response from Asian football fans."


It is the first time Internet ticket sales have been launched so
early for any AFC competition, reflecting the increasing interest
in a event that for the first time will feature Australia. Japan
are the defending champions.


Tickets are being sold through the AFC's official website www
.the-afc.com and www.afcasiancup.com.


Physical ticket sales will be launched on June 7.


The finals begin on July 7 in Bangkok and end in Jakarta on July
29.
