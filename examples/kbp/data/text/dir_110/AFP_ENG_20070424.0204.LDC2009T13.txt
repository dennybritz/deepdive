In the latest twist of a row between President Olusegun Obasanjo
and his deputy, Nigeria's Supreme Court has ruled that Vice
President Atiku Abubakar cannot be sacked from office despite his
defection to another party, court officials said Tuesday.


Obasanjo's friend-turned-foe has been in political battle with
the head of state for three years and was forced to quit the
ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) last December and join the
opposition Action Congress (AC).


The country's highest judicial court issued a ruling Monday
following an appeal by the government seeking to overturn a
February 20 Court of Appeal ruling stating that Abubakar could
not be removed.


"The term of the respondent has not expired and he cannot be
removed by the president except through impeachment by the
National Assembly," the Supreme Court said.


Abubakar contested last Saturday's presidential poll on the
ticket of the AC but came a distant third to PDP candidate Umaru
Musa Yar'Adua who was declared the winner.


Yar'Adua will now succeed Obasanjo whose two second four-year
term expires May 29 along with that of Abubakar.
