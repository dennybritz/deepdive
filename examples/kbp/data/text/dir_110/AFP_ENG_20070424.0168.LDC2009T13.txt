Indonesia's foreign minister said Tuesday an extradition treaty
with Singapore would help bring to justice officials and business
figures accused of corruption during former dictator Suharto's
regime.


Hassan Wirayuda said he hoped the agreement, finalised late on
Monday, would lead to the arrest of a number of suspects who fled
to Singapore and put their money in banks and other investments
in the affluent city-state.


"The regulation is retroactive, so that corruptors from the time
of Suharto, we will try to bring back here," he said.


Corruption flourished during Suharto's 1967-1998 rule.


Singapore, a regional financial centre, has denied allegations
from Jakarta law makers that it is used by Indonesian criminals
to launder money, and has insisted it has proper safeguards.


Wirayuda declined to release names of any suspects on the hit
list.


But the minister said the treaty, negotiations for which started
in 2005, would cover 42 types of crimes.


Wirayuda and Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo will sign the
pact on the Indonesian resort of Bali on Friday, a joint
statement Monday said.


Wirayuda declined to release further details of the treaty,
saying he had to first brief President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.


Defence ministers of both nations will also sign a defence
cooperation agreement which was negotiated in parallel with the
extradition pact.


The treaty comes amid strained relations between the two nations
over Jakarta's ban on the export of land sand used to make
concrete, a move that is hurting Singapore's booming construction
industry.
