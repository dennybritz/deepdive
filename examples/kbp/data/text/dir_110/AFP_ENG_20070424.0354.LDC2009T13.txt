Online music retailer Napster will shortly launch an over-the-air
music subscription service in Japan, through the mobile phone
giant NTT DoCoMo, according to the US firm's Japanese unit.


Napster Japan, a joint venture between the company and Tower
Records Japan, said in a statement on its website that it would
be the first deployment of Napster's over-the-air music
subscription service.


The service will provide DoCoMo's iMode subscribers with wireless
access to Napster's vast collection of songs which has been
already available to users of its "Napster to Go" service through
personal computers.


It will be made available through soon-to-be-released DoCoMo 904i
series of handsets, the statement said.
