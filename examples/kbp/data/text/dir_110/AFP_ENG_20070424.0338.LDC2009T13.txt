Boeing said Tuesday it received an order for 15 of its future 787
Dreamliner aircraft from Virgin Atlantic, the biggest such order
to date for Europe.


The order worth some 2.8 billion dollars at list prices was
previously listed on Boeing's orders records as from an
unidentified customer.


The order also includes options for an additional eight 787s and
purchase rights for an additional 20 of the aircraft.


"Virgin Atlantic is pleased to introduce the Boeing 787
Dreamliner as our aircraft of the future," said Steve Ridgway,
chief executive officer of Virgin Atlantic, in a joint statement
with Boeing.


"This revolutionary aircraft will bring a step change to the
industry, substantially reducing environmental impact and
incorporating innovative design and advanced technology, while
providing an enhanced flying experience for our passengers."
