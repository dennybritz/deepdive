A village vicar has called on Croatia's government to ban
teenagers from playing in football matches during Sunday mass,
local media reported Tuesday.


Valentin Halic had sent a letter of protest to the education
ministry complaining of a newly founded football school in the
northern village of Cadjavica which gathered some 80 teenagers,
half of whom are girls.


"I demand that in the future no manifestations, least of all
sports events, be organised on Sundays during mass," the priest
said in his letter.


Halic notably complained about training sessions for girls,
saying they now had no time to prepare for their upcoming
confirmation ceremony.


But football authorities opposed the claims, saying they enjoyed
the support of parents for the four teams they had founded.


"We teach the children to live healthy sporting lives," said
Josip Tadic, the local school's football coach .


The Catholic Church is influential in Croatia where almost 90
percent of its 4.4 million inhabitants are Roman Catholics.
