Japan's number two telecom operator KDDI said Tuesday its
operating profit was up nine percent in the past financial year
as it posted robust growth despite increasing competition in the
sector.


KDDI Corp, which runs the "au" cellphone brand, said its
operating profit rose 16.2 percent to 344.7 billion yen (2.9
billion dollars) in the year to March 31 from the previous 12
months.


Its revenue was up nine percent at 3.34 trillion yen.


Net profit, however, was down two percent at 186.75 billion yen,
which the company attributed to the absence of tax benefits it
enjoyed in the preceding year for merging with then loss-making
Poweredcom Inc.


The company said it enjoyed brisk sales in its mobile phone
services contracts as well as sales expansion of its ethernet
services.


"Regarding operating profit, the robust mobile phone sector
absorbed losses incurred in the fixed-line services," it added.


KDDI has been winning over subscribers from rival carriers since
Japan's introduction in October of "number portability" -- which
lets customers switch carriers without changing their phone
numbers.


KDDI forecasts a 17.8 percent rise in net profit over the next
fiscal year to 220 billion yen, with operating profit growing by
13.1 percent to 390 billion yen.


Sales revenue is expected to increase 4.9 percent to 3.5 trillion
yen.
