Israeli and Palestinian officials are conducting secret
negotiations in Europe on creating an independent Palestinian
state by the end of 2008, a Palestinian newspaper reported on
Tuesday.


"Palestinian and Israeli officials are holding secret meetings in
a European capital under the aegis of the United States and
Europe to try to reach an agreement on final status issues, with
a view to establishing a Palestinian state at the end of next
year," wrote the leading Al-Quds daily.


Basing its report on "informed" sources, the newspaper said the
talks were including the thorniest issues in the decades-old
conflict, such as borders, and the fate of Palestinian refugees,
Jerusalem and Jewish settlements.


The newspaper said the goal of the talks was to realise US
President George W. Bush's two-state vision before his term in
office expires in January 2009.


"The United States and European countries have put pressure on
the Israeli government to take part in these meetings," the
newspaper said.


Government spokeswoman Miri Eisin said the Israeli prime
minister's office "categorically denies this report".


Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat told AFP he was "not
aware" of such talks, but did allude to "unofficial" Israeli-
Palestinian meetings without elaborating.
