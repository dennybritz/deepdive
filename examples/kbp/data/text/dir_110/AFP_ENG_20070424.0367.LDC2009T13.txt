Troubled Pro Tour team Unibet.com have been hit with a new blow
as the Belgian- Swedish outfit were banned from taking part in
Wednesday's Fleche Wallonne classic, Blega agency said on
Tuesday.


Unibet, now re-christened Green Cycle Associates (the name of its
co-sponsor), have also been kicked out of Sunday's Liege-Baston-
Liege race.


On Friday a Brussels court dismissed a case brought by the
International Cycling Union (UCI) and Unibet against Amaury Sport
Organisation (ASO), the organisers of the two Ardennes classics.


UCI Pro Tour rules stipulate that all 20 Pro Tour teams, of which
Unibet is one, must be invited to take part in Pro Tour races,
but ASO has been using French and Belgian laws against betting
sponsorship as an excuse not to invite Unibet to its races.


Unibet has already agreed not to wear the sponsorship of the
betting website for races in the two countries and has even
changed its name, but that was not enough to secure invitations
from ASO to its races.


The team and the UCI then brought a case before the Belgian
courts but that too has now been unsuccessful.


ASO had previously barred Unibet from the Paris-Nice and Paris-
Roubaix classics in March and April respectively.


More significantly, though, ASO runs July's Tour de France and
Unibet are desperate to secure an invitation to that.


Unibet have not been invited to take part in the Tour of Italy
and will now take their case to London courts in an attempt to
secure a place on the Tour de France start line.
