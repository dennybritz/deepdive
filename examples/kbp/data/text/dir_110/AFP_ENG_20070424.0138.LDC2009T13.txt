Hong Kong share prices closed little changed Tuesday as a
recovery in China Mobile helped the market recoup early losses
driven by Wall Street, dealers said.


They said trading was also generally cautious ahead of the
settlement of April futures contracts on Friday.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 16.23 points at 20,572.80, off a
low of 20,396.37 and a high of 20,618.01.
