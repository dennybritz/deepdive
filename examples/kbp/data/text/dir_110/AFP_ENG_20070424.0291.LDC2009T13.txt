Afghan and NATO forces attacked a group of Taliban in
southeastern Afghanistan Tuesday, killing 11 of them, while
police had trapped scores of other rebels in a village nearby.


Troops set up an ambush for the rebels in the province of Zabul,
one of the worst for the raging Taliban insurgency, General
Rahmatullah Raufi told AFP.


"In the resulting exchange of fire, 11 Taliban were killed and
some weapons were confiscated by the Afghan forces. There have
been no casualties among Afghan forces," Raufi said.


Roughly 100 kilometres (60 miles) away, in the neighbouring
province of Uruzgan, police said they were surrounding for a
third day what they believed to be about 200 Taliban fighters,
including some top leaders.


They had seized weapons and two vehicles from the village in
Chora district and blown up one which was filled with explosives,
provincial police chief General Mohammad Qasim told AFP.


The group had assembled in the area for a meeting and some
reports suggested that the Taliban military operations commander
in the south, Mullah Dadullah, was among them, Qasim said.


A Taliban spokesman told the Pahjwok Afghan News agency that
Dadullah was not involved but admitted some of the movement's men
were trapped.


The Taliban insurgent movement -- which consists of hardcore
fighters, who follow an extremist anti-Western ideology, as well
as mercenaries -- has killed hundreds of civilians and troops
this year in its campaign against the government.


The Al-Qaeda-supported group was in power from 1996 to 2001, when
it was ousted by a US-led coalition.
