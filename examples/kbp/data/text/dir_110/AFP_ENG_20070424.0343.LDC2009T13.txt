Croatia's football federation said in a report Tuesday it expects
compensation from the sport's European governing body UEFA for
costs in its failed joint bid with Hungary to host Euro 2012.


"We told (UEFA president Michel) Platini that we had big expenses
... we will ask for between 2.5 and 3.5 million euros (3.4-4.8
million dollars)," federation chief Vlatko Markovic told the
daily Jutarnji List.


"He didn't refuse," Markovic said, adding he had proposed the
move to Platini during a meeting in Nyon, Switzerland on Monday.


An official request for the compensation will be sent to UEFA
after a meeting of a the Croatian football federation's executive
board later this week.


"The UEFA chief promised that they would discuss (Croatia's
demand) at the next meeting of UEFA's executive committee, and I
think that should be no problem," said Markovic.


Platini had proposed that the Croatian federation organise the
next UEFA congress in January 2008, said the official.


"We are going to accept ... that will ease the wounds. The UEFA
congress is a big honour for every country," he said.


Markovic has rejected calls in Croatia for him to step down
following the UEFA decision last week to choose Poland and
Ukraine to host the Euro 2012 championships ahead of Italy and
the Croatia-Hungary bid.
