Police in India's northeastern state of Assam said Tuesday they
had shot dead three separatist rebels and averted  potential
attacks on the main city of Guwahati.


City police chief S.N. Singh told AFP the three were shot dead
when anti- insurgency commandos swooped down on a suspected
hideout of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) on
the outskirts of Guwahati.


"The militants fired at the police team and in the ensuing
encounter three ULFA rebels were killed," Singh said, adding a
pistol, a grenade, two bombs and other explosives were recovered
from the dead militants.


"It was a major breakthrough as the ULFA rebels were in all
probability planning some attacks in the city," he said.


ULFA has been fighting for an independent homeland since 1979 and
was blamed for a string of attacks in January that killed about
80 people.


The group has also been blamed for at least half-a-dozen bomb
attacks in Guwahati over the past two months.


New Delhi ordered the Indian army to intensify operations in
Assam after the January attacks and the troops recently claimed
success with a senior officer saying 51 rebels had been killed
and 553 arrested.


More than 10,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in
Assam over the past two decades.
