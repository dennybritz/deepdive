A consortium led by British private equity firm Terra Firma said
Tuesday that it had withdrawn its takeover offer for Alliance
Boots, Europe's biggest pharmacy chain


The decision leaves a rival consortium led by US private equity
group KKR unopposed in its bid to buy Alliance Boots.


"The consortium of Terra Firma, Wellcome Trust and HBOS, has
decided to withdraw its potential interest in acquiring Alliance
Boots," a statement said.


Earlier Tuesday, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had raised its offer by
4.5 percent to 11.0 billion pounds (16.2 billion euros, 22.0
billion dollars).


The board of Alliance Boots had recommended the improved offer.


A takeover by KKR would represent Europe's biggest buyout by a
private equity firm.


It would also make Alliance Boots the first company to fall into
private hands while being listed on London's prestigious FTSE 100
share index.


KKR is joined in its bid by the executive deputy chairman of
Alliance Boots, Stefano Pessina.


Alliance Boots was created last year by the British merger of
pharmacy chain Alliance UniChem and health and beauty retailer
Boots.
