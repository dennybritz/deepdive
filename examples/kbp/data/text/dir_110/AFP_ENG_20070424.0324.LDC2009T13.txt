Spanish giants Real Madrid are tracking in-form Werder Bremen
playmaker Diego, according to Marca on Tuesday.


The 22-year-old Brazilian has been in stunning form for his club
this season, having moved from Porto in the close season, scoring
12 times including a 50-yard effort against Aachen las week.


Madrid are looking at Diego as a replacement for now departed and
retired French star Zinedine Zidane, said Marca.


If Diego does join, he would team up with former Santos team-mate
Robinho, now in his second season at Real.


The pair formed a dymanic and fresh-faced partnership at Santos,
helping the team win the Brazilian title in 2002 and 2004 and
reach the Copa Libertadores final in 2003.


Marca said that it would be difficult for Real to tempt Werder
into parting with their playmaker. Bremen sit second in the
German league and are in the UEFA Cup semi-finals.
