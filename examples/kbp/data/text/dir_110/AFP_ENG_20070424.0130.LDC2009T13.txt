UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday started his first
visit to Syria for talks with President Bashar al-Assad on
Lebanon and Middle East peace efforts.


Ban was due also to meet Vice President Faruq al-Shara and
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem during his day-long visit.


The talks are expected to focus on the planned international
tribunal to try suspects in the 2005 murder in Beirut of former
Lebanese premier Rafiq Hariri and on control of the border
between Syria and Lebanon.


Ban also hopes his Syrian visit "will be useful and constructive"
in helping move the regional peace process forward, UN deputy
spokeswoman Marie Okabe said earlier this month.


During a Middle East tour last month, the United Nations
secretary general visited Israel and the West Bank in a bid to
revive peace talks before attending an Arab summit in Riyadh.


He also visited Lebanon where he urged pro- and anti-Syrian
leaders to pursue dialogue in order to reach national
reconciliation and end Beirut's deepest political crisis since
the 1975-1990 civil war.


Ban flew in to Damascus from Qatar where he warned at an
international forum on democracy, development and free trade on
Monday that developing nations will suffer serious damage if the
Doha global trade talks do not succeed.
