Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday named
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as the ruling party's candidate for
president, ending speculation that Erdogan would stand himself.


"My brother Abdullah Gul, with whom we established this movement
(the governing Justice and Development Party, AKP)... is the
person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate
to become Turkey's 11th president," Erdogan told the AKP group in
parliament.
