Former presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton will represent the
United States at the funeral of former Russian president Boris
Yeltsin, the White House said Tuesday.


"They're going to travel together from New York tonight" and
return after the funeral, spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters.


The US ambassador to Moscow, William Burns, will also be part of
the delegation to the services for Yeltsin, who died Monday from
heart failure, aged 76.
