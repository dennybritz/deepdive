A man stormed into a London restaurant and hacked off his own
penis in front of horrifed diners, the Italian eaterie said
Tuesday.


The man charged into a branch of a pizza and pasta chain Zizzi in
a touristic area of central London on Sunday.


"This guy came running in then charged into the kitchen, got a
massive knife and started waving it about," diner Stuart McMahon
told The Sun newspaper.


"Everyone was screaming and running out as he jumped on a table,
dropped his trousers and popped his penis out.


"Then he cut it off. I couldn't believe it."


Police said a man aged 30-40 was injured through self-inflicted
wounds. He was taken to a south London hospital.


Zizzi said the knife-wielder was thought to have no connection to
the restaurant.


Staff stopped him entering one kitchen, then he ran into a second
kitchen area, the chain said in a statement.


"The man then picked up a kitchen knife and slashed himself
across the wrist and groin areas before running back into the
restaurant, where he continued to stab himself.


"This happened in a matter of seconds and was obviously extremely
frightening and distressing for the many customers and staff in
the restaurant at the time.


"The police arrived in a matter of minutes and took the man away.


"Apart from the man, we understand that no-one else suffered any
physical injuries."


The man was described as being in a stable condition in hospital
Tuesday.
