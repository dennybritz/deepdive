Factories in the 13 nations sharing the euro saw demand slow in
February, mainly because of fewer orders for airplanes, ships and
trains, official data showed Tuesday.


New industrial orders in the bloc fell 0.7 percent in February
but rose 4.7 percent over 12 months, the European Union's
Eurostat data agency said.


The figures marked a weaker trend compared to January when orders
eased only 0.1 percent in January and surged 12.2 percent over 12
months, Eurostat said, revising its data up from previous
estimates.


The February trend was much stronger when excluding big transport
equipment with new orders rising 0.5 percent over one month and
7.4 percent over one year.


In the broader 27-nation European Union, new industrial orders
were flat in February but rose 6.3 percent over one year.
