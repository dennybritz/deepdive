Syrian human rights activist Anwar Bunni was on Tuesday sentenced
to five years in prison on charges of "spreading false
information", his lawyer said.


Khalil Maatuk said he was sentenced in a Damascus criminal court.


Bunni, himself a lawyer, was arrested in the Syrian capital in
May 2006 after signing an appeal for radical reform in relations
between Syria and neighbouring Lebanon.


Syria's state prosecutor said in February that Bunni would be
prosecuted for spreading false information.


Bunni was the director of a legal rights centre in Syria financed
partly by the European Union and established by a Belgian non-
governmental organisation. The centre was closed down after his
arrest.


In a statement to the court in January, Bunni said he was being
judged for his opinions and had in no way violated the Syrian
constitution or the law.


The "Beirut-Damascus Declaration" published in the Lebanese
capital in May 2006 was signed by nearly 300 Syrian and Lebanese
intellectuals.


In a crackdown that followed in Syria, Bunni was arrested along
with nine others, including journalist and writer Michel Kilo and
communist activist Mahmud Issa.


On March 27, Kilo and Issa were charged in court with spreading
false information and sowing discord, and they also face possible
jail terms of at least three years.
