At least three Vietnamese fishermen have been killed in a clash
with Cambodian authorities during a crackdown on illegal fishing
on a lake in the country's northwest, a senior fishery official
said Tuesday.


The clash happened Monday when Cambodian authorities tried to
stop people from fishing illegally in protected parts of Tonle
Sap lake, said Nao Thourk, head of the agriculture ministry's
fisheries department.


But a group of Vietnamese fishermen, reportedly armed with
swords, began fighting back. Three Vietnamese, including one
woman, were killed in the clash, Nao Thourk said.


After the incident, the Vietnamese fishermen burned down one of
the department's nearby offices, Nao Thourk added. One Vietnamese
has been arrested over the arson.


Local fisheries officials have denied killing the Vietnamese, but
the incident was still under investigation, he said.


A local Khmer-language newspaper, Rasmei Kampuchea, reported that
fishery authorities opened fire to protect themselves when the
Vietnamese fishermen attacked them.


The Tonle Sap, or "Great Lake," is famed for dramatically
increasing its size by around four to five times during the rainy
season, with many Cambodians also reliant on its fragile
ecosystem to earn their living.
