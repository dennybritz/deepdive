Swede Robin Soderling extended the misery of former Roland Garros
champion Gaston Gaudio as he crushed the demoralised Argentine
6-1, 6-0 at the Barcelona Open on Tuesday.


Gaudio's star has fallen mightily since he won the French Open
three years ago.


His current slump has left the 28-year-old with a ranking of
69th, his season record now standing a dismal 4-9.


The player's lone bright spot of 2007 was an Acapulco quarter-
final in February, followed by second-round losses in Miami and
Monte Carlo.


"I don't know where my game has gone, I just can't seem to play
at the top level any more," he complained.


Soderling, seeded 13th, came to Spain with a strong 17-7 record
on top of a quarter-final last week in the principality.


Belgian Kristof Vliegen moved into the second round and a test
against clay- court monster Rafael Nadal after beating Italian
veteran Davide Sanguinetti 6-2, 6-4.


The Spanish top seed, riding a 67-match win streak on clay, beat
the Belgian last week in the third round on the way to a third
consecutive Monte Carlo title.


Serb Boris Pashanski advanced as Argentine Carlos Berlocq quit
with injury trailing 4-0 at the Real club.


American teenager Sam Querrey took a loss as he played in only
his second clay match at the ATP level, going down in the first
round to Italian Potito Starace 6-4, 6-4.


Nadal is bidding to lift a third consecutive Barcelona title as
he prepares for a another run at the French Open crown starting
May 27.
