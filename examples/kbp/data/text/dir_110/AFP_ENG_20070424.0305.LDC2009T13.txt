Nine Chinese workers were killed and seven kidnapped by gunmen
during an attack on an Ethiopian oil field Tuesday that also left
up to 65 Ethiopians dead, Chinese state media said.


About 200 unidentified gunmen launched an attack on the oil field
in Somali state where China's Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration
Bureau was exploring for oil, the official Xinhua news agency
reported.


The attackers engaged more than 100 soldiers protecting the field
in a fierce 50 minute gun battle, the report said, citing Xu
Shuang, the manager of Zhongyuan petroleum, a subsidiary of
China's oil giant Sinopec.


The attack was also confirmed by China's embassy in Ethiopia,
Xinhua said.


The oil field is located in Abole, a small town about 120
kilometres (75 miles) away from the Somali state capital of
Jijiga, it said.


China has stepped up investment and exploration in African oil
fields in recent years as its appetite for energy has boomed
along with its growing economy.


Chinese workers have also been plagued by a spate of killings and
kidnappings in Nigeria in recent months where Beijing is also
aggressively seeking to develop the nation's oil reserves.
