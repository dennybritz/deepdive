Aresenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who signed a new eight-year
contract with the English club at the start of the season, says
he would like to return to Spain once his time in the Premiership
is up.


"When I finish my time in the Premiership I would like to play in
the Spanish league. I'm attracted by the philosophy of a number
of clubs and so it would be nice to return one day," Spanish
sports daily AS quotes him as saying.


The Spanish international, who turns 20 next month, said his
future at the club was linked to that of Arsenal manager Arsene
Wenger, who is under contract until 2008.


"My plan is to see out my contract at Arsenal but my future is
undoubtedly linked with that of Arsene Wenger," Fabregas said at
a promotional event in Madrid, according to the newspaper.


"He was the person who came out and defended me when there was
talk of me leaving and he was the person who signed me when I was
just 16," said Fabregas, who added he believed Wenger would stay
on beyond 2008.


Fabregas has been strongly linked with a summer move to Real
Madrid, with the club president Ramon Calderon a long-term
admirer, but the player said he was unaware on any interest on
the part of the Spanish giants.


"I personally did not receive any sign of interest on the part of
Madrid but I know there may have been contacts last summer with
my agent. But they were with him, with me there were no
contacts," he said.
