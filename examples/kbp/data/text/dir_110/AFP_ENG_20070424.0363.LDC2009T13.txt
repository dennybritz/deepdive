Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Bedjaoui sought to reassure the
European Union about energy supplies from Algeria on Tuesday, but
called for Algerian firms to receive more access to the EU
market.


"We are proud that we respect all of our commitments," he told
journalists after meeting with EU officials in Luxembourg. "As we
did in the past we will do in the future."


Algeria supplies 11 percent of EU gas consumption, making the
North African country second only to Russia, which provides 24
percent.


Concerns are growing in the EU about its gas and oil supplies
after flows from Russia were temporarily suspended in recent
years due to problems in third countries crossed by pipelines.


Furthermore, Algeria has voiced support for the idea of an "OPEC
for gas" cartel to control prices, which, although difficult to
implement, has major consumer countries worried about their
vulnerability.


While eager to reassure the Europeans about Algerian supplies,
the minister acknowledged that there were "problems, and not only
technical" in nature, about signing a memorandum of understanding
on energy supplies.


He said that while Algiers was "ready" to sign a formal
agreement, the EU had to ensure that Algerian companies would get
the same treatment as European companies.


"We should be on an equal footing in this open energy market," he
said.
