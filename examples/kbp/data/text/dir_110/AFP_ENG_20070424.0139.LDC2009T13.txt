Recently merged telecommunications equipment giant Alcatel-Lucent
Tuesday reported a first-quarter operating loss of about 260
million euros (353 million dollars) due to declining sales in
mobile and core networks.


Sales fell 12 percent to 3.9 billion euros in the quarter, the
company said in a statement of preliminary results. The first-
quarter loss compared with a pro forma operating profit of 246
million euros a year earlier.


"Our first quarter results were impacted by lower volumes in
traditional wireless and core networks at a time when
considerable investments were made in the next generation of
these technologies," chief executive Patricia Russo said.


Russo also said that equipment orders were up by the end of the
quarter "which makes us confident of our capacity to return to
growth during the year."


First-quarter results, to be released in more detail on May 11,
are expected to include a pre-tax gain of 780 million euros from
the sale of satellite, transport and security assets to French
defence manufacturer Thales.


The group faces stiff competition and job cuts during the first
quarter totalled 1,900, or 15 percent of the three-year target of
12,500.


"Associated cost savings will be incorporated in our operating
results going forward," Russo said.


Shares in Alcatel-Lucent fell in early trading Tuesday.


In opening deals, Alcatel-Lucent was down 0.29 euros, or 2.1
percent at 9.01 euros. The Parisian CAC-40 Index was down 4.18
points at 5,913.14.
