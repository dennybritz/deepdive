Prince Albert II of Monaco on Tuesday pledged action to clean up
the financial industry in his tiny state, long seen as a haven
for money-laundering, but acknowledged more could be done.


"Ethics must remain as the backdrop for all actions," Albert told
an economic forum in Tokyo.


"The importance of Monaco's financial markets requires extreme
vigilance to avoid the development of a type of financial
activities which are not welcomed in our country nor in any other
country," he said.


"Our financial system has made significant progress in the last
two years and our efforts have been recognised by most of
international institutions, including the IMF," he said.


"But let's face it -- there's always room for improvement and
always room for further development."


Albert said he was encouraging investors and scholars from around
the world to invest in his principality, one of the richest spots
in Europe where a vibrant gambling industry underpins the
lucrative tourist trade.


The prince has been in Japan since Sunday and held talks with
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He also had an audience with Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko.


In Tokyo, he inaugurated an exhibition of memorabilia in memory
of his late mother, Hollywood starlet Grace Kelly.


He heads next to China.
