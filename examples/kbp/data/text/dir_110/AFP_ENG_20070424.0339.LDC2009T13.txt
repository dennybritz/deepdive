Manchester City have refused a request from bitter city rivals
Manchester United to reschedule their local derby clash on May 5.


United wanted to move the tie to a later time or date as they
have less than three days to recover from their Champions League
second leg clash against AC Milan in Italy, before tackling the
Manchester derby.


United face Milan at 1845 GMT on May 2 before facing a morning
kick-off three days later against City at 1045 GMT.


City fans would like nothing better than to scupper their rivals'
treble bid as their own season is drawing to a damp squib of a
close, with nothing to play for.
