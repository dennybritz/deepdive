Romania's parliament on Tuesday set May 19 as the date for a
referendum on the fate of president Traian Basescu who has been
suspended for allegedly violating the constitution.


Some 17.5 million Romanian voters will be asked: "Do you agree
that Traian Basescu should be impeached?"


Romania's president said last Friday he would not resign from
office following a vote in parliament to suspend him, forcing the
referendum on his impeachment.


He remains a popular figure in the country and stands a strong
chance of winning the referendum.


Romania's constitutional court upheld last Thursday's move by
parliament to suspend Basescu as a first step towards
impeachment.


Basescu, 55, was accused of 19 constitutional violations,
including "controlling through those close to him all state
institutions, of interfering in the law and protecting the
interests of the mafia in the Romanian economy."


Social Democrat Nicolae Vacaroiu, the senate leader, is interim
president until the referendum.
