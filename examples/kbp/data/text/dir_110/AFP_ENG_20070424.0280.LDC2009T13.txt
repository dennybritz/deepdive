A male student who decapitated a colleague after he made sexual
advances has been sentenced to death by Jordan's High Court, Al-
Arab Al-Yom newspaper reported on Tuesday.


The student was convicted of premeditated murder and possesion of
a sharp object, it said.


The two students, who were not identified, attended the same
university and knew each other well before the victim demanded
sexual favours of the other, the report said.


The 20-year-old man lured his fellow student to a deserted place
where he stabbed him. He then beheaded the victim and gouged out
his eyes out before hiding the mutilated corpse near a river.


The condemned man plans to appeal the sentence.
