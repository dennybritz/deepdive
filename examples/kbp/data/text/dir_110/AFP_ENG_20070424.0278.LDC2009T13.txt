Chinese President Hu Jintao expressed deep sorrow over the death
of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, calling his
contribution to Sino-Russian relations historic, state media said
Tuesday.


"As a representative of the Chinese people, I express my deep
sorrow over the passing away of Mr Yeltsin," China Central
Television quoted Hu as saying in a telegram to his Russian
counterpart Vladimir Putin.


"I express my deep condolences to the family of Mr. Yeltsin, the
Russian people and President Putin."


Hu called Yeltsin a "close friend of China," who helped establish
a strategic partnership between the two nations and worked to
resolve a long-standing border dispute.


"Mr Yeltsin made a prominent contribution to the development of
Sino-Russian friendship that will exist forever in the history of
Sino-Russian relations," Hu said.


Earlier, China's foreign ministry expressed sorrow over Yeltsin's
passing and praised him for contributing to bilateral ties.


Yeltsin, the former president who brought down the Soviet Union
and led Russia through the traumatic transition to democracy and
capitalism, died Monday aged 76.
