A coalition of Sunni insurgent groups led by Al-Qaeda's Iraq
branch claimed responsibility in an Internet statement Tuesday
for a suicide bombing which killed nine US soldiers north of
Baghdad.


"Two knights from the martyrdom-seeking brigade of the Islamic
State of Iraq plunged their booby-trapped trucks Monday into the
US crusader outpost in... Diyala," said the statement by the
self-styled Islamic State of Iraq.


The statement's authenticity could not be confirmed.


According to the US military, a suicide car bomber struck the
military outpost on Monday, killing nine soldiers and wounding
20, in the deadliest attack on American ground forces in Iraq in
16 months.


It said the bomber exploded his explosives-laden vehicle against
a patrol base in the restive province of Diyala, bringing the US
military death toll for April so far to 70.
