A North Korean diplomat who was once deported from Zimbabwe on
suspicion of smuggling rhino horns has been named the country's
new envoy to Italy, reports said Tuesday.


Han Tae-Song was appointed as the North's ambassador to Italy,
the country's official Korean Central News Agency said in a brief
dispatch.


No details were given, but South Korea's Yonhap news agency said
the diplomat in his mid-50s was expelled from Zimbabwe in 1992 on
suspicion of being engaged in illicit trafficking in rhino horns.


Since then, he has worked at the foreign ministry's international
organisations, specialising in United Nations affairs, Yonhap
said.


North Korea and Italy established diplomatic ties in January
2000.
