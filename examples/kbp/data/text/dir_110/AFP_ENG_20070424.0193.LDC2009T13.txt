A British-based consortium headed by former player Ray Ranson has
launched a 90million pounds (135million euros) takeover bid for
English Premiership side Manchester City, the Press Association
reported Tuesday.


Ranson is reported to have lodged his offer with the Eastlands
outfit late on Monday and was awaiting a response from the club.


Speculation around the future ownership of City has been rife
ever since club chairman John Wardle opened discussions with
various parties over the sale of his 29 percent stake in the
club, owned jointly with business partner David Makin.


So far there has been no sign of a deal being concluded although
an unnamed American consortium is currently seen as best placed
to complete a buyout of Wardle's shares.


Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was also linked
with a possible bid.


The Ranson offer, however, would be the first concrete proposal
to be put before Wardle and it is likely a board meeting will be
quickly convened to discuss a formal response.
