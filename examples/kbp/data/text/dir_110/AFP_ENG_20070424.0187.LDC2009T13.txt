Four out of 10 Swedes are willing to lower their standard of
living to help stop global warming, while seven out of 10 say
they are worried about climate change, a study published on
Tuesday showed.


"The concern is to be expected but the willingness to change the
way we live is more widespread than seen before. Climate issues
are very powerful and affect people profoundly," Anders Lindholm,
the head of the Demoskop polling institute which carried out the
study, told the daily Dagens Nyheter.


"Previously people were not so affected by the phenomenon but now
it has a personal impact on people. Buying environmentally
friendly products, such as cars, now has status," he added.


A total of 89 percent of those polled said it was important for
individuals to take responsibility for a better climate and as
many as 72 percent said they already recycle their rubbish.


Many also said they buy environmentally friendly and locally
produced products, or would be willing to do so.


Only a few however are willing to make changes in the way they
travel and about half of the respondents said they would not
travel less.


The study, in which some 2,500 people were interviewed on climate
and environmental issues, was compiled by Demoskop and
commissioned by Swedish TV4.
