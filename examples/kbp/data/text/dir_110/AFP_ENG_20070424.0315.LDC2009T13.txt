BBC journalist Alan Johnston, kidnapped in the Gaza Strip more
than a month ago, remains in good health, Palestinian deputy
prime minister Azzam al-Ahmed said on Tuesday.


In a meeting with Britain's consul general to Jerusalem, Richard
Makepeace, Azzam said "information we have indicates that Alan
Johnston is in good health," his office said.


"Efforts are continuing to obtain the British journalist's
release," Azzam added.


Johnston was snatched at gunpoint as he drove home from work in
Gaza City on March 12. He has now been held for far longer than
any other Western hostage in the territory.


On April 15, a little-known Islamist group claimed in a statement
to have killed him, but Palestinian authorities have said there
was no proof of the claim by the Kataeb al-Jihad al-Tawheed (The
Brigades of Holy War and Unity).


Last Thursday, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said in Sweden
that his intelligence officials had information that Johnston was
"still alive."


The BBC welcomed the news but said what it and Johnston's family
wanted more than anything was firm evidence of his wellbeing, as
well as his immediate release.


Johnston, 44 who was the only Western journalist left working
full time in the increasingly dangerous Gaza Strip when he was
taken.
