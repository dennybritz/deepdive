A woman teacher was assassinated by a balaclava-wearing gunman in
front of her pupils during class at a secondary school in South
Africa on Tuesday, police said.


The 30-year-old was shot once in the head and twice in the neck,
dying instantly in the classroom at Mount Frere in the Eastern
Cape, said police spokesman Captain Namukulungisa Jozana.


"He uttered no words, except shooting her," Jozana told the SAPA
news agency.


The motive behind the shooting was unknown and the gunman managed
to escape.


South Africa has one of the world's worst crime rates and around
50 people are murdered every day, according to official
statistics.
