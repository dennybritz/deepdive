Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf arrived in Spain on Tuesday,
part of a four-nation tour of Europe, for talks expected to focus
on Islamic radicalism and NATO's mission in Afghanistan.


General Musharraf was welcomed at Madrid's airport by Spanish
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. He was scheduled to meet
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and King Juan Carlos.


The Pakistani leader will travel to the southern city of Cordoba
during his four-day stay in Spain where he will visit the famous
ancient mosque and take part in a conference on dialogue between
the West and the Muslim world.


Drug trafficking, economic ties and immigration will also be on
the agenda, the Spanish foreign ministry said in a statement.


Cooperation with Pakistan is essential for the safety of the
roughly 700 Spanish troops which are taking part in NATO's
mission in Afghanistan since the country acts as a logistics base
for the soldiers, it added.


This is Musharraf's first visit to Spain, which has an estimated
70,000-strong Pakistani community, since he seized power in 1999.


It is the first official trip to Spain by a Pakistani leader
since then prime minister Benazir Bhutto came in 1994.


Musharraf's trip to Europe includes stops in Poland, Bosnia and
Turkey where he is schedueld to meet Afghan President Hamid
Karzai.


The meeting comes amid increasing tension between Afghanistan and
Pakistan over the fight against Taliban militants along their
common border.
