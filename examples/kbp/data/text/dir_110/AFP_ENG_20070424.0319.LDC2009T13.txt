A suicide attacker on Tuesday drove a truck at high speed into an
Ethiopian military camp where it exploded, wounding at least two
Somali government troops, witnesses said.


They said the truck burst into flames in the camp in Afgoye,
around 30 kilometres (19 miles) southwest of the capital
Mogadishu.


"I heard an explosion from the camp, then I saw a truck in
flames. Later we saw two (Somali) government soldiers being taken
to hospital," Sheikh Addow, a resident of Afgoye, told AFP by
telephone.


Another resident, who requested anonymity, said: "I saw a big
truck speeding into the Ethiopian camp and moments later it
exploded.


"I then saw two government soldiers wounded and covered with
blood."


It was unclear whether the driver or any Ethiopian soldiers, who
back the Somali interim government, had been killed or wounded.


"We do not know the casualty figures for the Ethiopian forces,
but I can assure you that there were some Ethiopians in the camp
at the time of the explosion," the second resident said.


The Ethiopian forces are housed in a farm belonging to Abdirahman
Jama Barre, the Somali foreign minister during the regime of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, who was toppled in 1991.
