Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is to pay tribute to the 32 victims
killed in the Virginia Tech massacre when she visits the United
States next month, royal officials said Tuesday.


A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said they were in discussions
with the British embassy there and Viginia state authorities to
determine what form the tribute may take.


"It's important that it's done in the right way so that the
Virginia Tech community and governor's office are content," she
said.


She ruled out a royal visit to the campus.


"It's a significant and terrible tragedy in the state. As the
queen is visiting so closely after the tragedy, it's important
that it's recognised and everybody readily agrees to that."


Virginia Tech University senior Cho Seung-Hui gunned down 32
students and teachers before killing himself on April 16, sending
shockwaves around the world.


The royal official also revealed that carbon emissions from the
81-year-old monarch's flights to, from and within the United
States would be offset for the first time.


"The discussions with the Department for Transport have been
going on for some time," she said.


"This is indeed the first time that one of the queen's official
state visits will have a carbon offset."


The queen and her husband Prince Philip are visiting the US from
May 3 to May 8 to mark the 400th anniversary of the founding of
Jamestown, Virginia, the first permanent English settlement in
North America.
