The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Tuesday its net profit rose 6.1
percent in the year to March due to increased trading on Asia's
largest bourse.


The TSE's full-year net profit rose to almost 20.0 billion yen
(170 million dollars) from a year earlier on revenue of 75.5
billion yen, up 8.0 percent, the exchange operator said in a
statement.


Operating profit jumped 14.8 percent to 33.0 billion yen while
the TSE's total transaction fees increased 11.5 percent to 32.8
billion yen mainly due to the increased value of trading in
domestic stocks on the Tokyo bourse.


The solid results are a boost to the TSE which is pursuing a
series of tie-ups in response to intense global competition,
after being forced to delay plans for its own stock market
listing until by 2009.


A private company, the TSE in February signed a business alliance
with the London Stock Exchange just weeks after signing a similar
agreement with the New York Stock Exchange.


The Tokyo bourse is also in talks with the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the largest US futures market, as well as with
Germany's Deutsche Boerse.
