British oil giant BP said Tuesday that net profit dropped 17
percent to 4.664 billion dollars (3.440 billion euros) during the
first quarter on lower production and as energy prices declined.


BP said in a statement that its oil production fell 3.0 percent
to 3.912 million barrels per day in the first quarter compared
with the final three months of 2006.


Output has fallen for seven consecutive months, while the first-
quarter drop was in-line with analysts' consensus forecasts.
