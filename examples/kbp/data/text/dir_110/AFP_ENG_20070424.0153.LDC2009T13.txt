Vietnamese police have broken up a wedding brokerage in the third
such raid in recent weeks as 66 young women were being paraded
before two South Korean men seeking wives, police said on
Tuesday.


Commercial matchmaking operations, although illegal, have become
popular here for some Korean bachelors searching for brides,
stirring anger for humiliating the women and leaving some
vulnerable to isolation and abuse.


Ho Chi Minh City police on Monday detained a 46-year-old woman
and a man aged 42, both Vietnamese, for organising the event in a
private house in the form of a "fashion show," said the Thanh
Nien (Young People) newspaper.


A police officer confirmed the raid and said an investigation was
underway.


Ha Thi Khiet, who chairs the Vietnam Women's Union, has travelled
to Seoul this week to discuss how to tackle the growing trend of
Korean men taking "marriages tours" to Vietnam, Yonhap news
agency has reported.


Vietnam has recently become a popular destination for bachelors
from South Korea and elsewhere searching for wives, often on
week-long trips that include medical checkups, visa procedures
and speedy honeymoons.


The international marriage market has been fuelled by a
preference for sons in parts of Asia, exacerbated by sex-
screening technology for pregnant women, with has left
proportionally more bachelors fighting over fewer women.
