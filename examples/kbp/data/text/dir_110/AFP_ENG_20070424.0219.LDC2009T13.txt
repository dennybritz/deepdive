Thailand on Tuesday approved a 1.3 billion baht (40 million
dollar) scholarship programme to try to recruit young people from
insurgency-hit southern provinces to become nurses.


Nurses, like doctors and teachers, have fled the Muslim-majority
region along the southern border with Malaysia as a three-year
insurgency has escalated, leaving more than 2,100 dead.


Beginning next month, Thailand will offer the awards to
graduating high school students from the region, giving them full
scholarships for a four-year nursing programme, health minister
Mongkol Na Songkhla told reporters.


"They must pay back the scholarship by working for eight years in
the restive provinces," Mongkol said.


The government hopes to train 3,000 nurses to offset mass
resignations by medical staff, which has left the region's health
system struggling to stay afloat, he added.
