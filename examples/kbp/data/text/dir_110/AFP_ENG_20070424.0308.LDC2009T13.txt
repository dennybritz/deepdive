Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said the
planned US missile shield could destabilise Europe and called for
a joint analysis of the "threat".


US Defence Secretary Robert Gates offered Russia cooperation on
missile defence activities Monday but was swiftly rebuffed by
Moscow.


"What we see in the American offer are several aims which do not
address the principal, that is a joint analysis of the threat,"
he told reporters in Luxembourg after meetings with leaders in
the Grand Duchy.


"One gets the impression that everything has already been decided
in Washington."


Europe itself had not been consulted, he said a day after talks
here with European leaders including his German counterpart
Frank-Walter Steinmeier.


"We don't really see a way of joining the project, we don't see
what interest there is in that," he added.


Russia has adamantly opposed plans to station 10 interceptor
missiles in Poland and a targeting radar in the Czech Republic,
countries that lie close to Russian territory and were once under
Moscow's control.


Nonetheless, Gates said Monday he remained "cautiously
optimistic" after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in
Moscow and even held out the possibility of co-locating a radar
with the Russians.
