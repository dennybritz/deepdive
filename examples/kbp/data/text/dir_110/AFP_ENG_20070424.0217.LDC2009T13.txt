International talks on North Korea's nuclear disarmament may drag
on forever if the United States and other parties fail to
coordinate, a former US official said Tuesday.


David Straub, former director of the State Department's Korea
section, said North Korea was accustomed to weathering pressure
while the five other countries involved in the talks have never
had a united policy.


"Six-party talks may last forever," he told a seminar. "Over the
middle and long term, I'm optimistic about the diplomatic
solution.


"But it requires major changes in tones and policy on the part of
all the other five, especially on the United States."


He said a united approach could have a profound impact on North
Korea, which missed an April 14 deadline to shut down its nuclear
reactor.


After its nuclear test last October, North Korea made it clear it
expected to negotiate as a nuclear weapons state, Straub said.


"As a consequence, its demands will increase," he said.


There will be limits, however, to the concessions that US is
prepared to make, he said.


"President Bush may make some additional concessions in the hope
that the talks may yet achieve their goal, but I believe that at
some point he will almost certainly say 'no more.'"


"In response, North Korea will blame the US for its 'hostility,'
and the talks will stall," he predicted.


Pyongyang may hope Washington will eventually accept it as a
nuclear-armed state, as the US had done with India and Pakistan,
he said.


"But the cases of India and Pakistan differ in basic ways from
North Korea. If North Korea is counting on such an outcome, it
has made a most serious strategic miscalculation," he added.
