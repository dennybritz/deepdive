Six members of two rival gangs were killed in the latest violence
to hit southern Nigeria's oil city of Port Harcourt, the region's
chief police officer said Tuesday.


"It was a cult fighting. No innocent lives were involved. The six
that died were cult members," Rivers state police commissioner
Felix Ogbaudu told AFP.


He said fighting broke out on Monday when one of the gangs
stormed a birthday event being organised by the leader of the
other group.


"Two people were killed during the invasion, while four were
later killed in a reprisal attack," he added.


The incident was the latest to rock Port Harcourt, the hub of
Nigeria's multi- billion-dollar oil and gas industry, in recent
weeks.


Many oil majors and service firms have their operational base in
the city, which is also the capital of Nigeria's oil-producing
but volatile Niger Delta.


On April 14, gunmen invaded two police stations in the city and
shot dead seven police officers.


The attacks came hours ahead of the start nationwide of state
governorship and assembly elections.


The oil-producing region has been the theatre of violence,
ranging from gang warfare to kidnappings of oil workers, for the
past several years.


Some 100 expatraites, mostly oil workers, have been kidnapped and
later released after spending days or even weeks in captivity.


Dozens of Nigerian security personnel have also been killed,
while Nigeria currently loses a quarter of its 2.6 million
barrels per day of exports to unrest in the region.
