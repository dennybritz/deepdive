Seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher said on Tuesday he
has no regrets after retiring from Formula One last year and
enjoys life more away from the track with his family.


After 15 years at the top, the 38-year-old German quit the sport
last year, having won five consecutive titles with Ferrari
between 2000 and 2004, but is enjoying life as an adviser for his
old team.


"I do not miss the racing driving at the moment at all," he told
Bild newspaper.


"I live a really good life now. I am a very happy man. I have had
a very nice time during the last years, but I am definitely
having a better time now.


"I can arrange my schedule now so that I can spend the school
holidays with my children. This is so nice for us. I simply have
more time at home."


After a stellar career, Schumacher said he enjoys watching the
races, but had no desire to get back behind the wheel.


"I like watching the races on television," he said.


"I find it quite amusing now. It is interesting to see things
from the other side.


"But I simply watch now to have fun with the family and friends."


And as for a winner of this year's championship, Schumacher is
true to his old team - even though they are five points behind
McLaren-Mercedes.


"I firmly believe in Ferrari," he said, "this is the only one
that counts."
