Shares in French construction group Eiffage dipped on Tuesday a
day after shareholders unanimously rejected a takeover bid by
Sacyr Vallehermoso of Spain, saying Sacyr should make a higher
offer.


In late morning trading Eiffage shares had shed 2.35 percent to
104.49 euros, wiping out earlier gains, in an overall Parisian
market which was down 0.53 percent.


In Madrid, Sacyr shares dropped 8.46 percent to 40.65 euros.


The Spanish group, which is heavily indebted, made an all-share
offer on April 19 worth 6.5 billion euros (8.8 billion dollars)
for total control of Eiffage in a deal that would create a
European construction giant.


The bid would create the fourth-biggest European civil
engineering and construction group, and "a major player in
construction in Europe," Sacyr chief Luis Del Rivero told a news
conference in Paris.


On Monday, the Eiffage board said Sacyr should file a new offer
that is "unconditional" and which is "at least equal to the
highest buying price" paid by recent purchasers of stock, "which
is to Eiffage's knowledge 129.3 euros a share."


Sacyr has offered 12 of its own shares for five Eiffage shares,
which it says offers a 30.6 percent premium on the one-month
weighted average Eiffage price as of March 20.


Sacyr Vallehermoso is already the leading shareholder in Eiffage
with 33.32 percent of the capital and 29.0 percent of the votes.


The bid is set to begin May 9 and run until July 2.
