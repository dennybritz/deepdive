Czech opposition to hosting part of an expanded US anti-missile
defence system rose to 68 percent in April from 61 in February, a
poll published by the official CVVM institute on Tuesday found.


The results shows "a clear increase in opposition to the
installation of the American anti-missile defence radar in the
Czech Republic with fewer undecided," CVVM said.


Of those hostile to plans for a US radar tracking station on
Czech soil, 43 percent were "resolutely opposed" with 25 percent
"rather against," the institute added.


The proportion of those backing the controversial project rose to
26 percent from 25 in February, with the number of undecided
respondents shrinking to six percent.


The poll of 1,011 respondents was taken between April 2 and 4,
CVVM said.


Support for a national referendum on the issue climbed to 77
percent of respondents in April from 73 percent in February.


Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek's fragile centre-right coalition
government last month approved the launch of negotiations with
Washington over hosting part of the controversial anti-missile
defence system.


But parliament will have the decisive say whether the former
communist, Soviet- bloc country hosts the US installation, after
the government ruled the issue was not suitable for a referendum.


Washington says the shield is to offer protection against a
possible Iranian missile attack.
