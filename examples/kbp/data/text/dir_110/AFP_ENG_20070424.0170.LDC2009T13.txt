Britain's government borrowed less in 2006/7 compared with each
of the previous three fiscal years, official data showed on
Tuesday.


The Office for National Statistics revealed also that public
sector net borrowing (PSNB), the government's preferred measure
of the public finances, stood at 8.5 billion pounds in March, up
on the 6.6 billion-pound deficit in the same month last year.


The figure for March was the most borrowed during the month since
1994.


Despite the monthly rise, the fiscal year (April 2006-March 2007)
deficit was lower than in 2005/6 and the lowest since 2003/4's
33.5 billion-pound figure.


Net borrowing, as measured by the PSNB, came in at 33.6 billion
pounds, down on the previous fiscal year's 38.0 billion pounds.


This meant that British finance minister Gordon Brown, who is
favourite to succeed Prime Minister Tony Blair later this year,
has met his most recent borrowing forecast for 2006/7.


In his budget last month, Brown revised down his forecast for
2006/7 PSNB to 35.0 billion pounds.


Meanwhile an alternative, but more volatile, measure of public
finances, increased to its highest monthly figure since records
began in April 1984.


Britain posted a public sector net cash requirement in March of
17.2 billion pounds, above last year's 15.9 billion.
