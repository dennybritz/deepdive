Communist Vietnam sent official condolences Tuesday over the
death of Boris Yeltsin, the former president who brought down the
Soviet Union and oversaw Russia's rocky transition to capitalism.


In a brief statement, Vietnam, one of the world's five remaining
communist-ruled nations, said: "We send our deep condolences to
the family of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin and to the
Russian people."


Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Dung said: "Vietnam highly
appreciated the active contributions of former president B.
Yeltsin to the restoration and the development of the
traditionally friendly relations and multi-faceted cooperation
between Vietnam and the Russian Federation."


Deep cold war ties between Moscow and Hanoi cooled in the early
1990s after Yeltsin ended the communist era in Russia, and with
it strong military and financial support for Vietnam, the former
enemy of the United States.


However, cooperation has increased again in recent years in
energy, education and other fields, and Vietnam in March backed
Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organisation, which Vietnam
entered in January.


Unlike the Kremlin leadership, Vietnam's government continues to
officially follow Communist doctrine. Last Sunday the Hanoi
People's Committee laid a basket of flowers at a Lenin statue in
Hanoi to mark his birth 137 years ago.


Yeltsin died Monday aged 76 and will be buried Wednesday in
Moscow.
