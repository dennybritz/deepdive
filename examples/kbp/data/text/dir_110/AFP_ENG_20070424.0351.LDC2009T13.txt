Human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday called on
Vietnam to free all political prisoners on its April 30
Liberation Day which marks the country's 1975 post-war
reunification.


The London-based group voiced deep concern about the communist
country's recent crackdown that has seen the arrests and
detention of lawyers, trade unionists, religious leaders and
Internet dissidents.


"For 30 April 2007, Amnesty International calls on the
authorities to release all those arrested, detained and
imprisoned solely for the peaceful exercise of their rights,"
said the group in a statement.


Vietnam traditionally amnesties or grants sentence reductions to
prisoners on several key dates including the Tet Lunar New Year
and Liberation Day.


Amnesty pointed at cases including the March 30 jailing of
dissident Catholic priest Nguyen Van Ly, the arrest of lawyer Le
Quoc Quan, and the scheduled trials of human rights lawyers Le
Thi Cong Nhan and Nguyen Van Dai.


"Numerous others, who are perceived by the authorities as
political dissidents, are under house arrest, under surveillance,
have had phone lines cut off, computers confiscated or have been
harassed and interrogated by government officials," Amnesty said.


The group called on Vietnam "to honour its international human
rights obligations by releasing all prisoners of conscience."
