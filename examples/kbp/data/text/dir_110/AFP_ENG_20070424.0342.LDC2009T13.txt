Two Israeli soldiers were lightly wounded in scuffles Tuesday as
thousands of right-wing radicals defied an army order and tried
to reach a former West Bank settlement evacuated in 2005.


"Two IDF (army) soldiers were lightly wounded by Israeli
citizens" marching towards the site of the evacuated settlement
of Homesh, which the army had declared a closed military zone, an
army spokesman told AFP.


"A group of Israelis arrived at the site, the soldiers showed
them a closed military zone warrant, and in response the Israelis
assaulted the soldiers and hit them," he said.


Three civilians were arrested and transferred to police custody.


Despite the army road blocks, thousands of activists reached
Homesh by walking through the surrounding hills of northern
Samaria, an organiser of the march, Yossi Dagan, told AFP.


"Some 10,000 people are marching towards Homesh. Some 3,000 are
already there. The army has set up road blocks but we have
bypassed them," he said.


"We are marching to Homesh in order to demand the correction of
the awful mistake of destroying settlements. It might take two or
three more attempts but in the end we will return there," he
said.


Israel evacuated five settlements in the northern occupied West
Bank in August 2005 as part of the disengagement plan under the
leadership of former prime minister Ariel Sharon.


Last month, thousands of right-wing activists were allowed to
reach and camp at Homesh, but the army later forcefully removed
several dozen protestors who refused to leave the site.
