Robbers made off with a sweet haul of cash from a Serbian
security firm's amoured vehicle when a guard stopped to buy a bar
of chocolate, a local newspaper reported Tuesday.


The driver of the bullet-proof Progard van was disarmed by the
three robbers Monday after his co-worker entered a grocery store
on the outskirts of Belgrade to buy the candy, said the Blic
daily.


In broad daylight, the robbers forced him to drive to a nearby
location before pushing him out of the van, snatching 20 bags of
cash and setting fire to the vehicle.


The amount of money stolen was put at several million dinars,
said Blic.


A police investigation has been launched into the incident, it
added.


The robbery was the third this year involving the Progard
company, with thieves having seized more than 20 million dinars
(250,000 euros, 335,000 dollars) in the two previous incidents.
