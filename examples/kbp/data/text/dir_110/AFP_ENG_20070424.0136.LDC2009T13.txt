Sri Lanka's astrologers say the exact moment when the nation's
cricketers leave their hotel for the World Cup semi-final against
New Zealand will determine if they will win.


It is not only the batsmen's timing at the crease, but also their
precise morning schedule that will decide the winner at Jamaica's
Sabina Park later on Tuesday.


In a country where even preparing a meal is often decided by the
stars, Sri Lanka's fortune-tellers are desperate to know when the
team will leave for the ground.


Arisen Ahubudu, an astrologer known for deciding lucky code names
for military operations, said the outcome will depend on the
planetary position at the time that the Sri Lankans set out for
the match.


"They will definitely win if they depart at an astrologically
right time," Ahubudu said -- though he declined to say what the
ideal time was.


Teams usually leave about two hours before the start of a match.
The semi-final starts in Kingston at 9:30am local time (1430
GMT).


Fellow astrologer Priyantha Ratnayake, known for his
controversial political predictions, said he saw a Sri Lankan
win.


"(Veteran opener) Sanath Jayasuriya's stars are placed on a
winning position and his luck should see Sri Lanka through," he
said.


Sri Lankan leading politicians, as well as military commanders,
are known to consult astrologers, and many have their own
personal fortune tellers.
