Two Greek Orthodox nuns on Tuesday were found murdered inside a
400-year-old mountain monastery in southern Greece, police said.


The nuns, aged 86 and 63, were found in their night garments on a
bedroom floor at the 17th century monastery of the Assumption of
the Virgin Artocosta in Arcadia, the eastern Peloponnese, a
police source told AFP.


The local police department did not give a cause of death, but
the source said the two women had likely been strangled.


The monastery gates were open and the premises had been searched,
but a preliminary investigation has not determined whether
anything was stolen.


The police were alerted by pilgrims who visited the monastery.


Perched on high cliffs in isolated areas, Greek monasteries are
frequently targeted by robbers for valuable Orthodox icons and
other relics of Greece's rich Byzantine tradition.
