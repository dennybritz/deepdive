Berlin zoo is set to repatriate the carcass of Yan Yan, a female
panda who died last month aged 22, to China following a request
from Chinese authorities, the zoo's director said on Tuesday.


The carcass will be sent to China "after the numerous necessary
bureaucratic details have been tied up," Bernhard Blaskiewitz
said.


Yan Yan was lent to the Berlin zoo in 1995 by China in an
ultimately unsuccessful attempt to produce offspring with the
zoo's male panda, Bao Bao, who at 26 is the oldest panda in
captivity in the world.


The female panda died suddenly on March 26, dealing a blow to the
zoo's attempts to breed the endangered species.


Life expectancy for pandas is normally around 34.


Yan Yan died in the midst of a storm of media coverage
surrounding a polar bear cub at the Berlin zoo, Knut, who has
become a global sensation after surviving rejection by his
mother.
