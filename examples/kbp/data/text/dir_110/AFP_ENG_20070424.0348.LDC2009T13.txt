A former senior British judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss on Tuesday
resigned as the coroner heading the inquest into the death of
Princess Diana and her Egyptian boyfriend Dodi Fayed.


"This inquest now requires a jury and I do not have the degree of
experience of jury cases that I feel is necessary and appropriate
for presiding over an inquest of this level of public interest,"
Butler-Sloss said in a statement.


In January, the 73-year-old said she would head the inquest on
her own, but the High Court later ruled in favour of Fayed's
father Mohammed, insisting that the inquest into their deaths
must be heard by a jury.


Fayed senior, the millionaire owner of Harrod's department store,
claims the couple's deaths were part of a plot by the British
establishment opposed to the mother of the future king marrying a
Muslim.


Not to have a jury would confirm his suspicions of a cover-up, he
believes.


Butler-Sloss said she will step down in June when Lord Justice
Scott Baker will take over.


"I must stress this does not require a fresh start for the
inquest," he said. "I will continue to preside over the pre-
inquest hearings until Lord Justice Scott Baker takes up the
appointment in June.


"This will ensure the inquest's momentum is maintained while he
will also have the opportunity to familiarise himself with the
voluminous paperwork associated with the inquest."
