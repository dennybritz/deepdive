Nine Chinese and 65 Ethiopian employees were killed on Tuesday in
an attack by armed men on an oil field in eastern Ethiopia, a
spokesman for Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told AFP.


"It is a cold blood killing, a massacre. It is a terrorist act,
ordered by a terrorist alliance that includes ONLF," said the
spokesman, Berekat Simon, referring to the Ogaden National
Liberation Front separatist group.
