EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Iran's nuclear
negotiator Ali Larijani will meet in Ankara on Wednesday and
Thursday, the Turkish foreign ministry said.


The two officials "will hold talks on Iran's nuclear programme in
Ankara on April 25-26," the ministry said in a brief statement
Tuesday.


The Ankara talks will be the first face-to-face talks between
Solana and Larijani in over two months in a bid to break the
deadlock in the nuclear crisis.


The pair will examine if there is any scope for reopening
negotiations to find an end to a five-year standoff that has
raised tensions between Iran and the West and seen Tehran slapped
with two sets of UN sanctions.


The two men held several rounds of talks last year and again in
the sidelines of a security conference in Munich on February 11,
but failed to find a solution.


This week's meeting will coincide with the midpoint of a 60-day
UN deadline for Iran to cease its uranium enrichment activities,
which Iran has flatly refused to do despite threat of further
Security Council sanctions.
