Tensions have clearly eased in Ivory Coast since rival leaders
signed a peace deal, the UN's assistant secretary-general for
peace missions Hedi Hannabi said on Tuesday.


"I found that there is a very clear, very palpable lessening of
tension," he told a UN-run radio station at the end of a two-week
fact-finding mission.


Hannabi said he had detected a "very clear willingness" of rival
leaders to implement the peace accord, which was signed last
month.


Also on Tuesday the Ivorian cabinet met in Grand-Bassam, south of
the capital, to discuss the implementation of the peace accord,
an official source said.


The meeting is to result in a "road-map for a clear
implementation of the programmes included in the Ougadougou
accords", according to a statement released by Prime Minister
Guillaume Soro's office.


It is to focus on the redeployment of state services, the
disarmament of former combatants and the merging of pro-
government and rebel forces.


After several mediation attempts by former colonial ruler France,
the United Nations, the African Union and a West African regional
bloc failed, President Laurent Gbagbo and Soro finalised their
own peace deal on March 4.


Under the agreement, Soro became prime minister, but doubts
remain over the two men's commitment to power sharing.
