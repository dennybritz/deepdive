Phil Mickelson has split with his long-time coach and joined up
with Butch Harmon, best known for having been the swing mentor to
Tiger Woods and Greg Norman.


The American is keen to improve the accuracy of his long game
which was responsible for his final hole collapse at the US Open
last summer and believes that Harmon is the man he needs.


"Buth is one of the very best teachers in the world," Mickelson
said on his personal website.


"He's helped two players rise to number one in the game and I'm
fortunate that he has agreed to spend time working with me on my
game, particularly on my driving.


"This has been a difficult decision for me. I feel that now is
the time to go in a new direction with Butch Harmon on my long
game."


Harmon, who coached Woods in the early stages of his professional
career before separating from him, worked with Mickelson on the
pratice range at the WCG Match Play Championship in California in
February and at last month's WGC-CA Championship.
