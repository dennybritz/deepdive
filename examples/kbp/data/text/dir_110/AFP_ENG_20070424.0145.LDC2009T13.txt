Aviva, the biggest insurer in Britain, said Tuesday that sales of
new policies jumped 18 percent in the first quarter owing to
strong performances in Britain and the United States.


Global sales rose to 9.183 billion pounds (13.516 billion euros,
18.332 billion dollars) in the record first quarter compared with
the final three months of 2006, a statement said.


"Our US business has been our star performer. Sales are up by 67
percent," Aviva's incoming chief executive Andrew Moss said.


Britain sales rose 9.0 percent to 3.5 billion pounds.


"Over the last two years in the UK, we've driven profitable
growth by simplifying our infrastructure, managing costs and
improving service," Moss said.


"This focus will continue and we have more to do, but we're now
seeing the benefits of our strategy with increases in both sales
and margin," he added.
