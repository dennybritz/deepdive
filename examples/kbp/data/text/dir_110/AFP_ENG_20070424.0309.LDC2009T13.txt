Spanish stocks slumped by more than 2.0 percent on Tuesday, led
by property and construction firms, amid concerns that a long-
awaited property crash was imminent, dealers said.


The Ibex 35 index of most traded shares, which hit successive
record highs earlier this month, fell just over 2.0 percent at
14.987,10 points at 2:30 pm (1230 GMT), easing from earlier lows.


The unease regarding the housing sector was triggered by the
sharp fall of shares in Spanish real estate company Astroc, which
have lost more than 60 percent in less than a week, after an
auditor's report raised concerns over its finances.


The market was also spooked by comments about the Spanish
property market by the president of French construction firm
Eiffage, Jean-Francois Roverato.


Roverato justified rejecting a takeover offer from Spanish
construction group Sacyr on the grounds that the Spanish firm's
real estate assets in its home market "could very soon be revised
down."


Spanish property prices have soared over the past decade, helping
to fuel high economic growth rates and the profits of builders.


But with household debt levels at record levels, new homes are
taking longer to sell.


Astroc's fall was hurting sentiment for the entire sector causing
other property and construction groups like Inmocaral and
Inmobiliaria Colonial to post sharp losses, dealers said.


The fall in construction and property firms was in turn hurting
bank stocks which are exposed to the sector through mortgage
loans.


Banco Popular, Sabadell and Bankinter all lost more than 2.0
percent in early afternoon trade.
