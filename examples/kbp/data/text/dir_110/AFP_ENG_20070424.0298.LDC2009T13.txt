Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling party won a landslide
victory in recent local polls, a pointer to national elections
next year, official results showed on Tuesday.


The Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won 1,591 of the 1,621 commune
councils -- small administrative bodies that govern rural
villages or city neighbourhoods -- in a vote on April 1, the
National Election Committee said.


Initial results had showed Hun Sen's party had won 1,592
councils.


"The result shows that CPP has won a landslide victory," said
Puthea Hang, an election monitoring official.


Cambodia's main opposition Sam Rainsy Party, historically the
kingdom's political underdog, won 28 top council seats, up from
27 announced earlier, while the royalist Funcinpec party, the
CPP's coalition partner, took only two communes, unchanged from
initial results, the committee said.


The polls were seen as a clue towards national elections next
year, paving the way for Hun Sen's continued grip on power.


But election monitors argued new election rules kept as many as
2.5 million Cambodians from casting ballots.


They said only 60 to 70 percent of the country's 7.7 million
eligible voters went to the polls, marking the lowest turnout
ever since Cambodia's first democratic elections were held in
1993.
