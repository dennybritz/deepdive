Road accidents cost 900 lives and left 18,000 people injured in
Jordan last year, with young children the main victims, official
figures showed on Tuesday, as the UN marks a Global Road Safety
Week.


The statistics from the kingdom's national centre for forensic
medicine said more than 98,000 road accidents were registered
last year, averaging one every five minutes and a death every 10
hours.


"The country is losing 700,000 dinars (100,000 dollars) a day
from accidents," it said in a report which found that children
between the ages of one and five accounted for the largest number
of casualties.


Health Minister Saad al-Kharbacha said the findings amounted to a
"disaster" for Jordan, which ranks second only behind Egypt in
the Arab world for the number of road accidents.


In 2002, the latest year for which figures are available, 1.2
million people of all ages died on the road around the world --
including 1,000 young people per day -- and between 20 and 50
million were injured, according to the UN.
