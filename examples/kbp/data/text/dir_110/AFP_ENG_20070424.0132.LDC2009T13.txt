Two men were beheaded by the sword on Tuesday after they were
convicted of murdering fellow Saudis, the interior ministry
announced.


Mohammed bin Jaber Abu Shaafa was executed in the southern city
of Jazan for stabbing Mussa bin Hussein Haqwi to death during a
fight sparked by a land dispute, it said in a statement carried
by the official SPA news agency.


Atef bin Mohammed al-Yassi was beheaded in the Muslim holy city
of Mecca for beating to death Saud bin Mussaed al-Abdali with a
piece of wood, it said in a separate statement.


The latest beheadings bring to 41 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia,
or Islamic law. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug
trafficking can all carry the death penalty.
