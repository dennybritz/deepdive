Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels are to take a brief break from
battle later Tuesday to watch the national cricket team play New
Zealand in the World Cup semi-finals.


"There may not be any attacks tonight because we are also
watching the match," Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan told AFP
by telephone from the rebel-held north of the island.


Tamil Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran is believed to be a
cricket fan.


The comments came the morning after the Tigers staged an air
strike against the military's main facility in the northern
peninsula of Jaffna -- the latest violence in a bloody civil war.


Sri Lanka's national team consists of two members of the minority
Tamil community. Religious leaders have said the multi-ethnic
side could be an example of unity to fractured nation.


Government sources said there would be no lowering of its guard
during the live broadcast from Jamaica of the semi-finals
overnight Tuesday, even though the rest of the country will
virtually shut down.


Official functions were also adjusted for the game.


The government's spokesman on defence, Keheliya Rambukwella, was
to host a dinner reception Tuesday, but fearing a low turnout he
arranged for a widescreen TV to show the match.
