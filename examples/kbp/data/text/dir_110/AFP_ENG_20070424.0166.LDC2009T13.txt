Norway will offer Iceland military support after the closing of a
US air base last year left the island nation with no permanent
defence, Norwegian officials said on Tuesday.


Norway and Iceland will sign an agreement on Thursday on the
sidelines of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Oslo, a
spokesman for the Norwegian foreign ministry said.


The details of the agreement were not immediately available but
according to the newspaper Aftenposten, the deal calls for
Norwegian F-16 fighter jets and Orion maritime surveillance
planes to be regularly dispatched to Iceland.


Iceland, like Norway a NATO member, has no armed forces of its
own.


The Norwegian military presence is aimed at helping Iceland
exercise its sovereignty over its airspace and waters, but does
not imply an automatic Norwegian defence of the island beyond
NATO accords if Iceland were to come under military attack,
Aftenposten reported.


The United States guaranteed Iceland's defence with a permanent
military presence from 1951 until 2006 under an agreement between
the two countries.


Despite vehement Icelandic protests, Washington last year closed
its Naval Air Station at Keflavik, once an important facility
during World War II and a NATO base during the Cold War but which
saw its importance diminish in recent years.
