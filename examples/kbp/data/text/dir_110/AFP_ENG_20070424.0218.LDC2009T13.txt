A top radical Islamist leader in Morocco who was arrested last
month after five years on the run recruited 18 youths in
Casablanca to join insurgents in Iraq, police sources said
Tuesday.


"Saad Houssaini, 38, also known as Mustapha, has been active in
the network tasked with recruiting young Moroccans convinced by
Salafist and Jihadist ideas to go and fight in Iraq," according
to a copy of the transcript of his questioning by police obtained
by AFP.


The young recruits come from the poor neighborhoods of the
Moroccan economic capital, the police transcript said, explaining
that "they are recruited to conduct terrorist operations against
innocent civilians in Iraq."


According to police, Houssaini said he had been contacted via the
Internet by a man in Iraq "who told me how the volunteers travel
via Istanbul and Syria," where the volunteer fighters "would join
the resistance."


Houssaini was arrested on March 8, part of an ongoing operation
by Moroccan security services which since 2006 has dismantled
some 11 networks for recruiting fighters for Iraq.
