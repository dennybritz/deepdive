French police are to question several executives at the European
Aeronautics Defence and Space Company this week over suspected
insider trading a year ago, a source close to the matter said on
Tuesday.


The investigation centres on a period shortly before EADS
surprised the stock market, and customers, with revelations that
it faced serious problems in production of its star product, the
A380 superjumbo airliner.


The announcement caused a crisis, boardroom upheavals, and
controversy over the sale of shares in preceding months by big
shareholders and of stock options by top executives.


The crisis has led to a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000
jobs.


The Internet site of monthly business publication Capital said
that the executives had been called in for questioning by police
specialising in financial crime.


The police were acting on instructions from two investigating
judges, Philippe Courroye and Xaviere Simeoni.


The Paris prosecutor opened an investigation on November 20, on a
complaint from an individual shareholder, into suspected insider
trading, the publication of false information and the receiving
of stolen goods with regard to EADS shares.
