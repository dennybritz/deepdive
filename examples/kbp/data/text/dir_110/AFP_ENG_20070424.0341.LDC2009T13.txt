US shares edged higher in at the opening Tuesday as Wall Street
digested a large number of corporate earnings reports and awaited
key economic data.


In the first exchanges, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose
22.18 points (0.17 percent) to 12,941.58 and the Nasdaq composite
increased 3.90 points (0.15 percent) to 2,527.57.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index added 1.46 points
(0.10 percent) to 1,482.39.


Fred Dickson, market strategist at DA Davidson, said earnings
reports would be key as well as an economic report on the housing
market.


"Wall Street will be buried today by a tidal wave of earnings
reports," he said.


"With nearly 500 companies reporting earnings today investors
will struggle just to get through the news releases and post-
announcement conference calls."


He said the level of Dow 13,000 "will prove to be a minor
resistance point in the current market rally" and added, "a
breakout above that level will depend on the earnings reports and
whether companies raise earnings guidance for the current
quarter."
