South African Rudi Koertzen equalled English umpire David
Shepherd's record of officiating in most one-day internationals
in the West Indies-Bangladesh World Cup clash here on Thursday.


The 58-year-old Koertzen officiated his 172nd match since making
his one-day debut at his home St George's Park, Port Elizabeth in
the South Africa-India series in 1992.


Koertzen is likely to overhaul Shepherd's record if he gets an
appointment in the World Cup semi-final between Sri Lanka and New
Zealand on April 24 in Jamaica and can go two better if South
Africa do not qualify for the April 28 final in Barbados.


"I am delighted to be in the same company as the legendary David
Shepherd," said Koertzen, who also has 80 Tests to his credit.


West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor holds the record for officiating
most Tests with 117.


Shepherd, who also officiated in 92 Tests, retired two years ago.
