Russia and India are to hold a four-day counter-terrorism
exercise in the Sea of Japan, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported
Thursday.


Starting Tuesday, more than 10 vessels from the two countries
will practise techniques for repelling terrorist attacks on ships
and liberating ships seized by terrorists, the agency quoted a
Russian Pacific fleet spokesman as saying.


The vessels will operate out of Russia's southeastern port of
Vladivostok, and attack helicopters and a submarine will also
take part.


The exercise reflects the close ties between the two countries'
military forces, although it is unusual for taking place close to
Japanese coastal waters.


Russia supplies India with about 70 percent of its military
hardware.
