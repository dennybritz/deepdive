Iran's lead nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani agreed in a telephone
call with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana Thursday to
resume their talks on April 25, state television said.


"In accepting the convening of a new round of negotiations, Ali
Larijani told Mr Solana that while insisting on its absolute
rights regarding its nuclear programme, Iran is ready to
negotiate with the concerned parties," the television said.


"The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations next
Wednesday," it added without giving a venue for the talks.
