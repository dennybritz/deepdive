Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi will on Saturday begin a two-
day visit to Saudi Arabia in which he will discuss developments
in the Middle East, the Italian embassy said on Thursday.


Prodi is expected to meet King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz and other
Saudi officials for talks on regional issues, including the
situation in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon and Iraq,
Italian Ambassador Egenio d'Avria told reporters.


Prodi's talks will also include security cooperation between the
two countries, he added.


The Italian embassy said that Prodi will also address the
appointed male-only Shura (Consultative) Council.


Italy was the top European commercial partner of the oil-rich
kingdom in 2005, the embassy said, adding that trade between the
two countries totaled 8.3 billion dollars (6.1 billion euros) in
2006.
