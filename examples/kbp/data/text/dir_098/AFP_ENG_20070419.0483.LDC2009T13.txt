Poland's ex-parliamentary speaker Marek Jurek, until last week a
key member of the ruling conservative Law and Justice party,
announced Thursday he is setting up a new political party.


"We want to be a pro-life party that backs family values," Jurek
told reporters.


Jurek, 46, stood down as house speaker last week after lawmakers
failed to push through amendments to the constitution that would
have toughened Poland's abortion laws, already among the
strictest in Europe.


On Saturday, Jurek -- a staunch Catholic -- announced he was
leaving Law and Justice (PiS) after locking horns with Prime
Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who founded PiS with his twin
brother, President Lech Kaczynski.


Jurek accused the prime minister of undermining any chances of
seeing the abortion debate back on parliament's agenda in the
near future.


Jurek, who had long been close to the Kaczynskis, piloted moves
to strengthen anti-abortion legislation.
