The gravestones of 52 French Muslim soldiers have been daubed
with Nazi slogans in a military cemetery in northeastern France,
officials said Thursday.


Swastikas and slogans such as "Heil Hitler" were also painted
Wednesday night on the ossuary of the Notre Dame de Lorette
cemetery, the biggest military graveyard in the country, said the
local prosecutor.


President Jacques Chirac condemned the desecration, saying it was
an "unspeakable act that scars the conscience, insults the memory
and dishonours its authors."


"This desecration is all the more shocking as it affects the
gravestones of combattants who gave their lives for France," said
the president in a statement.


The cemetery, near the town of Arras, contains the graves of many
thousands of soldiers who died in World War I.


A hundred gendarmes were scouring the site Thursday for clues
about the perpetrators.


Rightwing presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy also expressed
his "profound indignation" over the attack and "condemned in the
strongest terms these cowardly and abominable acts."


Sarkozy, the former interior minister and frontrunner in the vote
on Sunday, called for the perpetrators to be arrested and
"punished in an exemplary manner".


His Socialist rival Segolene Royal also condemned the attack,
saying they "violate the memory and the respect owed to all those
who participated in the battles of the First World War."


A man is currently being held in the northern city of Lille in
connection with an attack on a Jewish cemetery earlier this month
in which 51 tombstones were knocked over.
