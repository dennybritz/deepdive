The Russian state airline Aeroflot will not be privatised before
2009, Russian Economic Development Minister German Gref said
Thursday.


"Today we have looked at the privatisation program for 2008 and
it does not call for the privatisation of Aeroflot ...," Gref
said in a report carried by the Ria Novosti news agency.


The state, which currently has a 51 percent stake in the carrier,
hopes to take in 12 billion rubles (346 million euros, 470
million dollars) from its overall privatisation initiatives next
year, Gref said.
