Belgium's highest court on Thursday overturned the convictions of
seven members of a far-left Turkish group for belonging to a
terrorist group, opening the way for a fresh trial.


The court ruled that comments made by the presiding judge at the
appeal court in Ghent, northern Belgium "could leave the
impression of bias" and therefore his ruling last November was
deemed unsafe.


The decision was greeted with cries of joy and embraces from
supporters of the extreme left DHKP-C militants.


The Ghent court ruled they were members of a terrorist
organisation after arms were discovered in an apartment they
occupied in Belgium.


The case has soured Belgian-Turkish relations, with Ankara
claiming the right to try the members of the group which is
listed as a terrorist organisation both by Turkey and the
European Union.


Belgium refused, citing concerns over respect for human rights in
Turkey.


Ankara strongly criticised Belgium in March 2006 when Fehriye
Erdal, a key figure in the DHKP-C, managed to evade Belgian
police while under surveillance. She has not been found since.
