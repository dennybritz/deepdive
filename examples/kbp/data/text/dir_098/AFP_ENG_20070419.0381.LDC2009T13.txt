Duncan Fletcher will quit as England coach after their last World
Cup match against West Indies in Barbados on Saturday, the BBC
reported on Thursday.


Peter Moores, currently the England Academy coach, will take over
on a temporary basis, said the report.


David Morgan, the chief executive of the England and Wales
Cricket Board (ECB), is due to give a news conference in
Bridgetown later Thursday to discuss the team's pitiful World Cup
campaign which has seen them fail to reach the semi- finals.


Fletcher, 58, has been England coach since 1999 but has been
under pressure since the winter when Australia reclaimed the
Ashes in a 5-0 whitewash.


England's exit from the World Cup was confirmed on Tuesday when
they were defeated by nine wickets by South Africa who claimed
the last semi-final spot as a result.
