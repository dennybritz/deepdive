Japanese Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma and his German counterpart
Franz Josef Jung agreed Thursday that the European Union should
maintain its ban on arms exports to China, press reports said.


Kyuma told Jung in a meeting here that Japan would become
suspicious as a neighbour unless China became more transparent
about its national defence policy, Kyodo News and Jiji Press
reported quoting Japanese defence ministry officials.


Kyuma added that China's defence spending had been growing
rapidly over the past decade or so, the reports said.


Jung arrived in Japan earlier Thursday after a visit to China,
where he met with Chinese Defence Minister Cao Gangchuan.


He said that he told Chinese defence officials about the
importance of transparency, the reports said.


"Unless there is a major change in human rights and other aspects
(in China), the export ban should be maintained," Jung was quoted
as telling Kyuma.


Kyuma called on the European Union to remain "cautious" about
lifting the export ban, the reports said.


The EU's arms embargo was imposed after the Chinese government
crushed democracy activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in
June, 1989.
