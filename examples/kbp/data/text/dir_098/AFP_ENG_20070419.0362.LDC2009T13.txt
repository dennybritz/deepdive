Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I have spent 34 years with cricket bat in my hand. I am not
going to make any hasty decision on my career whether remaining
in cricket or out of cricket. I'll relax a bit before I decide
anything."


- West Indies captain Brian Lara.


"I am very motivated. I will give 110 percent."


- New Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik.


"We want to continue where we left off against Australia in New
Zealand. They're a tough side if they get on top of you and
they've got a point to prove."


- New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming on his team's eagerly-
awaited clash with Australia who they beat three times in
succession earlier this year.


"It has been a very difficult month for me. But things are
slightly better now that I am back with the Sussex family. Going
out on the field and doing my best for Sussex is my chance to
escape from all the other things."


- Mushtaq Ahmed on his joy at being back in county cricket after
the turmoil of the World Cup.


"Makhaya's a great team man and we'll be reassessing before the
next game."


- South Africa skipper Graeme Smith on the decision to drop
Makhaya Ntini from the win over England.
