Bomb-sniffing dogs on Thursday raised the alarm about a
suspicious package that was to be delivered to UN headquarters
but the content was determined to be harmless, a UN spokesman
said.


Spokesman Farhan Haq said the dogs at the UN gate grew suspicious
as the package in a postal truck was about to be delivered early
Thursday.


After the New York police bomb squad was called in, "the package
was determined to be harmless and the situation is now all
clear," he added.


The package contained intestinal medication, a UN official said.
