Police Thursday lamented the fact that a university killer's
hate-filled video manifesto was aired by US media.


"I was disappointed in the editorial decision to broadcast these
disturbing images," said Virginia police superintendent Steve
Flaherty, noting that until recently, only law enforcement
professionals would have seen such footage.


"I'm sorry that you all were exposed to these images," he said.


On Wednesday, NBC news received a multi-media package sent by Cho
Seung-Hui, a student at Virginia Tech who killed at least 30
people and himself in a bloody shooting spree on Monday.


After first informing the police about package, NBC later aired
it ensuring Cho's disturbing diatribe was immediately shown on
evening news broadcasts across the country.
