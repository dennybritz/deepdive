Ottawa said Thursday it would closely scrutinize the case of
Huseyin Celil, a Canadian national sentenced in China to life in
prison on terrorism and separatism charges.


"We're reviewing the judgment and we will have a reaction in due
course." Andre Lemay, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Peter
MacKay told AFP.


"The Chinese don't consider Mr. Celil a Canadian citizen so it
has made it difficult for us get information or access to him,"
he added.


Celil, 37, was sentenced to life in prison for "terrorist
activities and plotting to split the country," Xinhua news agency
reported from Urumqi, capital of the China's westernmost Xinjiang
region.


He is a "prominent member of the 'East Turkistan' terrorist
organization," the report said.


According to his wife in Canada, Celil was extradited from
Uzbekistan to China in May last year where he vanished into
Chinese custody. Canadian diplomats have since been trying to
gain access to him.


Celil fled China a decade ago and arrived in Canada in 2001 as a
refugee and became a Canadian citizen.


He was arrested in Tashkent on March 27 last year while trying to
renew a visitor's visa in the Uzbek capital.


His wife and three of his six children live in Burlington,
Ontario. A friend told a local newspaper Cecil was in Uzbekistan
to try to get his three other children out of China.
