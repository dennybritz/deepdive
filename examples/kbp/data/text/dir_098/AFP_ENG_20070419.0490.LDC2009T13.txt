The BBC and the father of its correspondent missing for over a
month in Gaza cautiously welcomed Thursday a statement by
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas that the reporter was alive.


The comments came shortly after Abbas said his intelligence
officials had information that Alan Johnston was still alive, a
few days after a report that he had been killed.


"Clearly we welcome this news but what Alan's family and the BBC
want more than anything else is firm evidence of Alan's wellbeing
and his immediate release," a BBC spokesman said.


Johnston's father Graham, speaking from his home in Cairndow, on
the western Scottish coast, was jubilant at the development.


"That's really good news. The other day was the worst day of my
life," he said.


"This is the news I've been waiting to hear and I don't think the
Palestinian president would say this unless he was convinced it
was true.


"But we still don't have proof of life. That's what I want
desperately. It's been nearly six weeks now," he added.


Last Sunday, an Islamist group claimed it had killed Johnston,
one of the few Western reporters to have both worked and lived in
the territory.


But the Palestinian government has said that so far there was no
proof of the death claim by the little-known group, Kataeb al-
Jihad al-Tawheed (The Brigades of Holy War and Unity).
