Dutch cycling star Michael Boogerd announced Thursday he will
retire as a professional at the end of this season.


Boogerd, who will be 35 next month, turned pro in 1994, and over
the past decade has dominated Dutch cycling along with Erik
Dekker.


He won stages in the Tour de France in 1996 and 2002 and finished
fifth overall in the 1998 edition of the race.


"It's a special moment, emotional but not dramatic. I want to
finish this season in style starting on Sunday," said Boogerd at
a press conference ahead of this weekend's Amstel Gold Race, an
event he won in 1999.


Boogerd said he had not yet thought about his future, but added:
"I don't really have any worries concerning this."


Dekker has been a team manager with Rabobank since retiring just
over a year ago.
