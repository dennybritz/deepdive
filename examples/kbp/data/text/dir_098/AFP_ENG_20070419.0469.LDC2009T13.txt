Doug MacLean was fired as president and general manager of the
Columbus Blue Jackets here Thursday after the club once again
failed to reach the National Hockey League playoffs.


The Blue Jackets, an expansion team founded in 2000, have never
reached the 16-team Stanley Cup playoffs and never even truly
challenged for a spot. In MacLean's tenure, the club was never
within 19 points of a playoff berth.


They struggled again this past season, winning 33 of 82 games for
only 73 points, seven-worst in the NHL and 23 points out of a
playoff spot.


MacLean, the only president and general manager in the club's
history, fired coach Gerard Gallant in November after the Blue
Jackets started the season 5-10 and hired former Philadelphia
coach Ken Hitchcock.


The Blue Jackets won 28 of 62 games under Hitchcock but
attendance has dipped from 18,136 in the club's first season to
16,401 this season.
