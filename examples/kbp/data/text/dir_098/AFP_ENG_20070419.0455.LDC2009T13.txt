London's Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) oil market said Thursday
it would launch a new crude oil contract next month for sour
crude from the Middle East.


The new heavy crude contract will be priced in US dollars and
sold alongside London's Brent North Sea crude and New York's main
oil futures contract, light sweet crude, the exchange said in a
statement.


The Middle East sour crude contract will launch on May 21 pending
regulatory approval, it added.


Consumers have access to large supplies of heavy, sour crude, but
most refiners prefer light, sweet oil -- such as Brent North Sea
-- because of its low sulphur content and relatively high yields
of gasoline, heating oil, diesel and jet fuel.


The ICE's move will mark the first time that an existing sour
crude contract has been traded alongside Brent and New York
crude.


"We have designed this contract in response to customer demand
for a better tool to serve their risk management needs within the
dynamic global crude market," said David Peniket, ICE Futures
president.


"This will be particularly useful for producers, refiners and
hedgers in Asia and the Middle East, as well as complementary to
our highly liquid Brent and WTI contracts."


The Middle East is one of the world's largest crude oil producing
regions and sends around 70 percent of its exports to Asia.
