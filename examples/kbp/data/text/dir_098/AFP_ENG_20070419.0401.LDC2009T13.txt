A leading opposition group, the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP),
announced Thursday it would not boycott Saturday's presidential
election.


The decision could undermine a threatened boycott by 18
opposition groups who were to meet later Thursday.


"We will participate fully in the National Assembly and
presidential elections," said Edwin Ume-Ezeoke, the national
chairman of the ANPP, one of two major opposition parties.


The opposition coalition had not taken a joint decision yet on
fielding a common presidential candidate, he added.


The coalition was to meet later Thursday after its threat to
boycott the election unless it was postponed until "transparency
and fairness" can be guaranteed.


The United States and European Union have called on the
opposition not stage a boycott.


The second largest opposition party, Action Congress (AC), said
it would only support the postponement of the poll if "all the
signatories to the agreement remain faithful to it."


"For the avoidance of doubt, should any of the signatories back
out of the agreement, the AC, without further consultation with
the group, will decide an appropriate course of action," said a
party statement.
