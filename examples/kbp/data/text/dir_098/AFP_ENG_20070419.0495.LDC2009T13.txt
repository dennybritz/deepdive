"It is with great sadness that the (MoD) must confirm the death
of two soldiers from the Queen's Royal Lancers, killed by an
improvised explosive device in Maysan Province, southeastern

The soldiers were on a routine patrol in a Scimitar armoured
vehicle when they were hit by the blast, it said.


"Three further soldiers were injured, one of them very seriously.

Iraq since the March 2003 US-led invasion, according to MoD
figures.
