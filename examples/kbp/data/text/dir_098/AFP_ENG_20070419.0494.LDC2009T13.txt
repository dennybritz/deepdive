Sweden on Thursday signed an agreement with the Palestinian
Liberation Organisation (PLO) to give 160 million kronor (17
million euros, 24 million dollars) in indirect aid to the
Palestinians.


The majority of the financial aid will be channeled to the PLO
through the United Nations, the European Union and the World
Bank, a statement from the Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (SIDA) said.


The agreement between SIDA and the PLO was signed as Palestinian
President Mahmud Abbas visited Stockholm.


SIDA director general Maria Norrfalk said the aid would "help the
Palestinian people in their struggles towards democracy and
respect for human rights, to create jobs and support their work
for peace."


The money is in particular aimed at improving the education
system and water and electricity supplies in the Palestinian
territories.


The EU was the biggest aid donor to the Palestinian government
until the radical Hamas movement came to power in March 2006.


The Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the European Union, the
United States, the United Nations and Russia -- then suspended
direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, demanding it recognise
the state of Israel, past peace agreements and renounce violence.


In March 2007 a new government was formed bringing together Hamas
and Fatah in a unity coalition.


Abbas is currently on a European tour in a bid to convince the EU
to resume its direct financial aid. He visited Stockholm on
Thursday and held talks with Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.
