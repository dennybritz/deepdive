India's annual summer monsoon, crucial for hundreds of millions
of farmers, will fall short of the normal amount of rain, the
meteorological department forecast on Thursday.


"It is going to be 95 percent of the average," P.S. Goyal, a
senior weather office official, told reporters in New Delhi.


The rains, which sweep the subcontinent from June to September,
are vital to India's farm economy which contributes about a
quarter of the country's gross domestic product.


The season accounts for around 80 percent of the India's annual
rainfall.


According to the weather office, a monsoon season is considered
normal if the rains equal 98 percent to 102 percent of the
average.


The prediction is based upon a newly-adopted statistical forecast
system and has a margin of error of plus or minus five percent,
Goyal added.


Data reviewed by the department, which includes sophisticated
supercomputer- generated models, suggested that the monsoon would
fall below the bottom end of that range, said Goyal.


The weather office would update the Thursday's forecast in June,
he said.


The southwest monsoon normally starts in the first week of June
off the southern coast of Kerala and moves north to cover all of
India by the middle of July.
