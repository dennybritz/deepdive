Three European scientists were awarded the 23rd Japan Prize here
Thursday for outstanding achievements in science and technology.


Albert Fert of France, professor at University of Paris-South,
and Germany's Peter Grunberg, of the Research Centre of Solid
State Physics, jointly received the prize for "innovative devices
inspired by basic research."


Britain's Peter Ashton, a honorary professor of forestry at
Harvard University, was honoured in the category of "science and
technology of harmonious co- existence."


The annual prize was launched in 1985 by the government-funded
Science and Technology Foundation of Japan, to contribute to
developments in science and technology.


Emperor Akihito, at an award ceremony accompanied by Empress
Michiko, said Fert, 68, and Grunberg, 67, had discovered the
phenomenon of giant magneto-resistance -- applied extensively to
computer hard-drives and random-access memory -- and spin
electronics.


Ashton, 72, has contributed to conservation through his studies
of the main timber trees in Southeast Asian rainforests.


"Science and technology provide invaluable blessings to mankind
and society," Akihito said. "This is why I feel it so important
for all of us to endeavor so that science and technology will
continue to develop through cooperation across national
boundaries and bring benefit to people."


Prize money of 50 million yen (about 420,000 dollars) was awarded
in each category.
