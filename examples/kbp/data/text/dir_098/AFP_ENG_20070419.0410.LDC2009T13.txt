The European Union on Thursday agreed to make inciting racism and
xenophobia a crime across the 27 member states, EU diplomats
said.


The agreement allows for between one and three year prison terms
for public incitement to violence or hatred directed against
people according to their race, colour, religion, descent or
national or ethnic origin.
