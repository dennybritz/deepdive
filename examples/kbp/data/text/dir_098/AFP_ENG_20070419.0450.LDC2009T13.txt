A human rights group said Thursday the Democratic Republic of
Congo government must do more to stop former rebel warlords from
using children as soldiers.


Human Rights Watch said some 300 to 500 children as young as 13
currently serve in recently formed armed brigades in eastern
North Kivu.


"The Congolese government should immediately stop former rebel
warlords now commissioned as national army officers from
recruiting and using child soldiers in army brigades deployed in
North Kivu province," the organisation said in a statement.


According to the organisation, the brigades are deploying
children in military operations against local armed groups,
including those fighting the government in neighbouring Rwanda.


The organisation also called on the Rwandan government to stop
allowing children from there to be recruited for North Kivu
brigades.


The DRC military began integrating rebel fighters in the region
as part of the regular army in January, following fighting that
killed 170 and displaced about 100,000.


The head of the Congolese military has ordered North Kivu
brigades to stop recruiting child soldiers. But Human Rights
Watch says the order has not stopped the practice.


Earlier this month, the United Nations mission in the DRC also
criticised the use of child soldiers. At that time, the brigades
had demobilised only 37 of the 267 minors believed to be among
their ranks by the Congolese authorities.
