Six road workers kidnapped by Al-Qaeda-linked Muslim extremists
were found beheaded Thursday in the southern Philippine island of
Jolo, the military said.


The severed heads of the six mostly-Christian workers were found
in the jungles of Jolo by soldiers, four days after the workers
were seized while heading to a government road project, said
Major General Ruben Rafael.


The six were seized by Al Bader Parad, a commander of the Abu
Sayyaf, a Muslim extremist group responsible for the worst terror
attacks in Philippine history.


One of the soldiers who found the remains said, on condition of
anonymity, that the heads had been scattered in various places in
the largely-Muslim island.


The soldier said the troops had been tipped off on where the
heads could be found.


Parad had earlier demanded a ransom of five million pesos
(105,000 dollars) for the hostages but the local government had
said it could not pay it.


More than 8,000 troops are on Jolo on instructions from President
Gloria Arroyo to crush the Abu Sayyaf.


The group has been blamed for a series of bomb attacks in the
Philippines in recent years, as well as high-profile kidnappings
of Christians, foreigners and missionaries.


The group is also sheltering two members of the Jemaah Islamiyah,
Indonesians Dulmatin and Umar Patek, allegedly involved in the
deadly 2002 Bali bombings which left more than 200 dead.


Intelligence officials say the Abu Sayyaf had contacts with the
Al-Qaeda network of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden.
