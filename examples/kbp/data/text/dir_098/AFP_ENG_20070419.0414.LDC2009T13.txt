Italian police on Thursday exhumed the body of  a Polish seasonal
worker whose death in 2005 may be linked to a human trafficking
ring, police and consular officials said.


The body of Dariusz Olszewski, who died in April 2005 at age 23,
was exhumed in Cerignola, a town about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
from the southern port of Bari, as part of a probe into
suspicious deaths at "work camps" in the region.


An autopsy is under way, police there told AFP.


Olszewski's mother had requested the exhumation because she did
not believe her son had died of natural causes, the Polish
consulate in Rome told AFP.


Poland's embassy in Rome had addressed a letter to local
authorities citing witnesses who saw Olszewski's body "covered
with blood, his head swollen, with beating marks on the face and
body," the ANSA news agency reported.


Last July, police dismantled several "work camps" in the Puglia
region where about 100 Polish labourers were reportedly housed in
barracks patrolled by armed guards and risked beatings if they
tried to flee.


Two months later Polish police issued a list of 120 names of
Poles who had gone missing in Italy since 2000. Then in November,
Polish police announced the arrest of a human-trafficking ring
that delivered Polish workers to factories around Bari.


The centre-left government of Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
approved draft legislation in November that would allow
undocumented workers to obtain a residency permit if they can
prove they were victims of "serious exploitation."
