The commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, US General Dan
McNeill, said Thursday he was unable to confirm the interception
Iranian-made mortars and explosives in the country.


"I don't deny that position and I'm very interested how the
insurgents might be helped and who might have helped the
insurgents," McNeill told reporters in the Afghan capital.


"Obviously, the US Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff
have far more information than I do right now," he added.


General Peter Pace, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs, said
Tuesday that coalition forces had intercepted Iranian-made
mortars and explosives in Afghanistan destined for the Taliban.


After 30 years of war, Afghanistan is awash with weapons of all
kinds and of different origins. Iran, in particular, furnished
the Northern Alliance with weapons during their struggle against
the Taliban government.


Mcneill, the head of the International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF), also said he had no hard intelligence on the existence of
training camps for Afghan insurgents in Iranian territory.


"There is no report of that fact," he said.


A number of American officials have accused the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards of training and arming Shiite militants in
Iraq.
