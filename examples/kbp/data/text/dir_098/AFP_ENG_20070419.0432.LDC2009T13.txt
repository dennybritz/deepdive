The Football Association (FA) on Thursday fined Sheffield United
and Reading following incidents which marred their Premiership
clash on January 20.


Sheffield were fined 10,000 pounds (20,000 dollars) and Reading
5,000 pounds (10,000 dollars) after both clubs admitted failing
to ensure that their players and/or officials conducted
themselves in an orderly fashion.


The hearing considered charges issued after a 53rd-minute
challenge by Blades' substitute Keith Gillespie on Stephen Hunt
sparked clashes at the Madejski Stadium.


Blades manager Neil Warnock and Gillespie were sent off while
Downes was also dismissed for his part in the melee during
Reading's 3-1 win.


Reading coach Wally Downes has also been fined 2,000 pounds and
handed a one- match touchline ban after admitting a charge of
improper conduct.


The same charge against Reading academy manager Eamonn Dolan was
withdrawn.
