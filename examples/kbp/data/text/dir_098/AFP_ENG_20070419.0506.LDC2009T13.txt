Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday proposed to
make Norway the first "zero-emission" state by 2050 and reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2020.


"We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 30
percent by 2020," Stoltenberg said in a speech at his Labour
Party's annual congress.


The pledge by Norway, which is not a member of the European
Union, outshines the EU's proposed plan to cut its emissions by
at least 20 percent during the same period.


Stoltenberg urged his party to make environmental history and
said: "By 2050 even larger reductions will be necessary. The
wealthy countries must become zero emission states."


"Norway would become the first country in the world to adopt such
a concrete measure," he said.


"This means that for every tonne of greenhouse gases that is
discharged we will make sure that the equivalent amount has to be
reduced somewhere else," he continued, referring to a
compensation mechanism outlined in the Kyoto Protocol.


In the short term, the prime minister said Norway's emissions
would by 2012 be reduced by 10 percent more than what is required
by the Kyoto Protocol.


A white book on Norway's fight against climate change is due to
be presented to the Norwegian parliament next month.


Norway -- the third largest exporter of oil and natural gas,
fossil fuels seen as one of the main causes of global warming --
already covers almost all of its electricity needs with "clean
energy" from hydropower.
