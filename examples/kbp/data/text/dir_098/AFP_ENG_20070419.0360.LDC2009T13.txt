Mauritania's first democratically elected president Sidi Ould
Cheikh Abdallahi was sworn in on Thursday, in a landmark transfer
of power from military to civilian rule.


Holding a Koran, the 69-year-old former political prisoner and
ex-government minister, took the oath in a ceremony conducted by
the head of the country's constitutional court.


"I commit myself to faithfully and impartially undertake the
duties, to uphold the constitution and abstain from any
initiative to change the clauses relating to the presidential
mandate," Abdallahi, dressed in a brown suit, declared.


His swearing in marks the final step in a successful transfer of
power from the military junta that took power in a bloodless coup
19 months ago, to a democratically-elected president for the
northwest African Islamic republic.


Last month's election was the first democratically-organised vote
in the African state which has a chequered history of military
coups and authoritarian rule.
