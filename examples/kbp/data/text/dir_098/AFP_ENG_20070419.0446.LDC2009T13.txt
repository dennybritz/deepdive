Kenya has recalled Norway-based midfielder John Muiruri for the
African Nations Cup return match in Swaziland in June, officials
said on Friday.


The veteran midfielder missed the first leg won by Kenya 2-0 last
month after the Harambee Stars failed to secure his release from
his Norwegian club FK MOSS.


Coach Jacob Mulee said he had been assured that Muiruri, arguably
one of the best midfielders in the country, would be available
for the June 2 match in Mbabane and was included in the 37-man
provisional squad he named on Friday.


He said the team, which will start residential training camp
early next month, would play two build-up matches against
neighbours Uganda and Tanzania before travelling to Swaziland.


Kenya is placed third behind Group six leaders Angola with three
points from as many matches.
