The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average share index opened lower
Thursday, after striking a record high a day earlier, following
some sharp falls on Asian stock markets, particularly in China.


Analysts said the Asian market declines would likely take some
steam out of the US market and said they expected some pullback
in American shares.


The leading blue chip Dow index fell 52.58 points (0.41 percent)
to 12,751.26 in opening deals after striking an all-time closing
high of 12,803.84 points on Wednesday.


The tech-rich Nasdaq composite dropped 15.55 points (0.62
percent) to 2,494.95 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's
lost 5.60 points (0.38) percent to 1,466.90.


"The catalyst for the down move is fear of a rate hike in China
and an associated 4.5 percent drop in the Shanghai (stock)
market," said Dick Green, a president at Briefing.com.


"The (US) market has become overextended again," he said.


The opening losses came despite robust earnings news from the
financial sector as Bank of America and Merrill Lynch both
reported better-than-expected first quarter profits.
