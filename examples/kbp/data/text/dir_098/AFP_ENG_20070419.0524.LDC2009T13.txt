The war in Iraq "is lost" and a US troop surge is failing to
bring peace to the country, the leader of the Democratic majority
in the US Congress, Harry Reid, said Thursday.


"I believe ... that this war is lost, and this surge is not
accomplishing anything, as is shown by the extreme violence in
Iraq this week," Reid said, on the same day US President George
W. Bush was giving a speech at an Ohio town hall meeting
defending the war on terror.
