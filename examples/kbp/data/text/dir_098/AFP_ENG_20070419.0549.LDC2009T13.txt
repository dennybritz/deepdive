US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on Thursday declined to
weigh in on the impasse between the US Congress and President
George W. Bush over a deadline to withdraw US forces from Iraq.


Asked if there was a compromise the US military could propose,
Gates said: "I haven't given it a lot of thought, and I certainly
haven't talked with anybody back at the department of defence,"
he said.


"This is really a discussion that has to be between the president
and congressional leadership," said Gates.


Gates, who spoke just before arriving in Baghdad, also said the
White House had not asked him for advice on the issue.


Legislation pending in the Democratic-controlled House of
Representatives would pull US combat troops out of Iraq by
September 2008. The US Senate version would begin getting US
forces out in mid-2007, with the goal of having most of them
withdrawn by March 31, 2008.


The White House wants no withdrawal deadlines. At stake is a 100
-billion-dollar emergency bill to fund the US-led wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan.


Bush and Democratic leaders reported no breakthrough in their
differences over the war when discussing an Iraq withdrawal
timetable at the White House on Wednesday.
