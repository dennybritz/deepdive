Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar won the toss and decided to
field against the West Indies at Kensington Oval here on
Thursday.


With both the teams already out of the semi-final, they play to
avoid the last two finish in the tournament.


Both teams made two changes from their line-ups of the last
matches. The West Indies brought back spearhead Jerome Taylor and
Marlon Samuels in place of Ian Bradshaw and Kieron Pollard who
both played in the defeat against South Africa.


Bangladesh dropped batsman Shahriar Nafees and paceman Shahadat
Hossain who both played in their defeat against Ireland, bringing
back fit-again paceman Syed Rasel and batsman Javed Omar.
