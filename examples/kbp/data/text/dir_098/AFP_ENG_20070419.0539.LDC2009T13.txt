Former CIA operative Luis Posada Carriles, wanted by Cuba and
Venezuela for the deadly downing of a Cuban jet, has been freed
on bond in Texas, police said Thursday.


"He was out of here this morning," Jerry Payan, a police officer
in charge of inmates said, after Posada paid 350,000 dollars to
be released pending trial May 11 for immigration fraud and other
charges.


Earlier this month a US judge here said the Cuban-born Venezuelan
national could be released on bail on condition that he remain
confined to his Miami home and submit to "electronic monitoring,"
according to the text of the order by the federal court in El
Paso.
