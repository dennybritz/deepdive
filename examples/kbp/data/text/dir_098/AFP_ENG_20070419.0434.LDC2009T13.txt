Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas said Thursday his intelligence
officials had information that BBC journalist Alan Johnston,
kidnapped more than a month ago in Gaza, was "still alive."


"Our intelligence services have confirmed to me that he is
alive," Abbas told reporters during a visit to Stockholm, adding
that he wanted "to acquire his release alive."


Johnston, 44, was snatched at gunpoint from his car as he drove
home from work in Gaza City on March 12 and has become the
longest-held Westerner in the increasingly lawless territory.


Last Sunday, an Islamist group claimed it had killed Johnston,
one of the few Western reporters to have both lived and worked in
the territory.


But the Palestinian government has said that so far there was no
proof of the death claim by the little-known group, Kataeb al-
Jihad al-Tawheed (The Brigades of Holy War and Unity).


No Westerner has so far been killed after being abducted in Gaza,
where hostages are generally used to lever concessions from the
authorities and are usually released unharmed within days of
their kidnapping.


Johnston's ordeal has sparked international protests, with
solidarity demonstrations held in Brussels, Lebanon and
throughout Britain.


Thousands of people around the world have signed an online
petition calling for his release, with hundreds also posting
messages of support on the BBC News website.


Johnston has been with the BBC for 16 years and has also reported
from Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.
