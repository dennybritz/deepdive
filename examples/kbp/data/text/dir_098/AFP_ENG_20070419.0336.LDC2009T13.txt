Iran on Thursday vegemently denied claims by a top US general
that Iran has sent mortars and explosives to Afghanistan destined
for the Taliban, Iranian media reported.


Iran "denies claims by the US officials regarding finding
Iranian-made weapons in Afghanistan. It is baseless and a
repetitive scenario," Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad
Ali Hosseini was quoted on semi-official Mehr news agency.


"Such claims can not be used as a cover up for the US increasing
failures in Afghanistan," he added.


On Tuesday, General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said that coalition forces have intercepted Iranian-
made mortars and explosives in Afghanistan destined for the
Taliban, suggesting an expanding Iranian challenge to US forces
in the region.


"It is not as clear in Afghanistan which Iranian entity is
responsible. But we have intercepted weapons in Afghanistan
headed for the Taliban that were made in Iran," Pace told defence
reporters here in Washington.
