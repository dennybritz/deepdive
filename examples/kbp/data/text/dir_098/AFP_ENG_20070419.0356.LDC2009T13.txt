France has dispatched its top foreign ministry official to Kabul
to try to win the release of two French aid workers held hostage
by the Taliban for more than two weeks, a spokesman said
Thursday.


The foreign ministry's secretary general Philippe Faure is to
hold talks on Thursday and Friday with Afghan officials on
efforts underway to free the two aid workers and their three
Afghan colleagues.


"Our objective remains, more than ever, to bring back the members
of the group safe and sound and as quickly as possible," said
foreign ministry spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei.


The Taliban have been holding the two French nationals and three
of their Afghan colleagues from the Terre d'Enfance (A World For
Our Children) charity since seizing them in the southwestern
province of Nimroz on April 3.


A videotape showing the French man and woman was shown on
Canadian television at the weekend. Paris says it has not
received any demands from the kidnappers.


President Hamid Karzai has said that the government will not make
any more hostage deals with the Taliban following the
controversial release of five rebels in exchange for kidnapped
Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo last month.


Faure is to meet in Kabul with NGO representatives and members of
the French expatriate community, the foreign ministry said.
