A news magazine whose cover story was titled "Sarkozy: what the
big media don't dare or don't want to say" said Thursday its
feature on alleged excesses by France's frontrunning presidential
candidate had proved so popular it has printed up an extra 80,000
copies.


The weekly Marianne said it had initially sold 300,000 copies and
then put an extra 60,000 copies on sale on Wednesday, but these
had already sold out.


The 80,000 extra copies of its edition containing the article,
which originally came out last week, will hit the newstands on
Friday, it said.


The 12-page dossier on Sarkozy, who leads the polls for the first
round of voting on Sunday, concluded with the claim that he
represents a "serious danger" for democracy and the French
republic.


Sarkozy has suffered during the election campaign from his
inability to shed the tough-guy reputation earned during his days
as interior minister.


On the Internet, a raft of websites are promoting the "Anyone But
Sarkozy" stance, portraying the candidate as the worst possible
choice for the presidency.
