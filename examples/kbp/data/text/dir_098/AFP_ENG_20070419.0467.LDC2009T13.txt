Seven referees and two linesmen were suspended by the Italian
Referees Association (AIA) on Thursday after being implicated in
the match-fixing scandal which rocked the Serie A last season.


The decision to suspend referees Paolo Bertini, Stefano Cassara,
Antonio Dattilo, Marco Gabriele, Gianluca Paparesta, Tiziano
Pieri and Salvatore Racalbuto, and linesmen Marcello Ambrosino
and Duccio Baglioni, was taken after public prosecutors in Naples
closed their investigation on April 12 by making accusations
against the officials.


Prosecutors, this time dealing with the purely legal side of the
affair, named 48 people they suspected of wrongdoing.


The AIA initially reacted to the news by suspending two referees
and two linesmen who were supposed to officiate at second
division matches the following weekend.


Italian giants Juventus were stripped of their last two league
titles and demoted to Serie B with a penalty of nine points after
being found guilty of match-fixing in last summer's scandal.


AC Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina and Reggina were also implicated in
the affair, but escaped with only points penalties for the
beginning of the 2006-2007 Serie A season.


According to prosecutors, some of the referees handed out yellow
cards to certain players, leading at times to their
unavailability for future matches, especially against Juventus.


There were also a number of questionable penalty or off-side
decisions made to favour the teams implicated in the scandal.
