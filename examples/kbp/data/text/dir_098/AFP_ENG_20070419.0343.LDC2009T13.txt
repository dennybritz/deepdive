At least nine people were killed and 12 wounded in renewed

They said eight were killed when a mortar landed in a bus station
in southern Mogadishu.


"I have counted at least eight bodies, some of them dismembered,"
said eyewitness Hussein Mohamed Abdi.


Another civilian was killed in Fagah district in northern
Mogadishu, said a local resident, Alaso Haji Warsame.
