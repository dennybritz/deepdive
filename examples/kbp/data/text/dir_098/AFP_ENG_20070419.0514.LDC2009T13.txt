A consortium comprising Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland,
Santander of Spain and Dutch group Fortis said Thursday they
would meet with Dutch bank ABN Amro next week to discuss a mooted
takeover bid.


"Fortis, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander have written to ABN
Amro confirming attendance at a meeting on Monday 23 April to
clarify their intentions and interests which they are confident
are straightforward from a shareholder, regulatory and execution
perspective," the consortium said in a brief statement issued in
London on Thursday.


"The banks welcome the opportunity to present their proposals to
ABN AMRO so that they can be considered by the Board of ABN AMRO
alongside any proposals from Barclays."


ABN Amro is currently in exclusive talks with British bank
Barclays over a potential takeover.
