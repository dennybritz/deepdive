A German court handed two 22-year-old men lengthy prison
sentences Thursday for killing a man by using a washing machine
and other household items as "lethal weapons" after a botched
robbery.


The regional court in the eastern city of Potsdam convicted the
two defendants, who were not identified, and sentenced them to 13
years, and 13 years and six months in prison respectively.


The accused had broken into the apartment of a 46-year-old man in
the nearby town of Zossen in May to steal cash, cigarettes and
beer.


When the victim, who was an alcoholic and developmentally
disabled, failed to hand over money, the robbers beat him, kicked
him and struck him with a frying pan, a table leg and a
broomstick before hoisting his 34-kilogram (75-pound) washing
machine and dropping it on his head.


"The accused attacked their helpless victim with particular
brutality," presiding judge Frank Tiemann said.


The robbers left his home but returned to fetch a forgotten
knapsack, and attacked the man again. He died soon after of his
injuries.


Each defendant had personality disorders diagnosed by a
psychiatrist and was drunk at the time of the crime -- both of
which were considered mitigating factors by the judges.
