The two main Nigerian opposition parties said Thursday that they
would not carry out a threatened boycott of Saturday's
presidential election.


The All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and the Action Congress (AC)
announced separately that they will take part in polls to find a
new head of state and legislative assembly.


The poll should produce the African giant's first civilian-to-
civilian power transfer since independence in 1960. But it has
been preceded by widespread violence and political turmoil over
moves to stop a vice president from taking part.
