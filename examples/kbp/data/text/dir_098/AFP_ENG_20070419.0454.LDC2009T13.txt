Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas will have an audience with
Pope Benedict XVI next week, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported Thursday, citing Vatican sources.


Abbas, on a European tour seeking a resumption of aid to his
government, will see the pope on Tuesday, ANSA said.


The Palestinian leader's tour has already taken him to France,
Poland and Sweden, and he is also expected in Bulgaria, Greece,
Italy and Switzerland.


Benedict and Abbas met at the Vatican once before, in December
2005.


The European Union was the biggest aid donor to the Palestinian
government until the Hamas militants came to power in March 2006.


The Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the EU, the United
States, the United Nations and Russia -- then suspended direct
aid to the Palestinian Authority.
