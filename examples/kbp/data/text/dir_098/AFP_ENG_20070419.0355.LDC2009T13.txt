Three more American soldiers have been killed in attacks in Iraq,
the US military said Thursday, taking its losses to 53 this month
alone.


Two soldiers were killed on Wednesday when their vehicle was
struck by a roadside bomb north of Baghdad after returning from a
combat patrol.


The third soldier died when a combat security patrol was raked
with gunfire in southwest Baghdad, also on Wednesday.


The latest deaths, announced while US Defence Secretary Robert
Gates was visiting Iraq, took the military's losses since the
2003 invasion to 3,313, according to an AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.
