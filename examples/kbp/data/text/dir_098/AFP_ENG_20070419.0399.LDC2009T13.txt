Slovakia aims to boost the amount of energy produced from
renewable sources to around 12.0 percent in 2020, well below the
EU-wide target figure of 20.0 percent fixed by heads of state
last month, industry minister Lubomir Jahnatek said on Thursday.


"With the exception of hydro, which is a traditional and known
renewable source, we have to say openly that we produce less than
1.0 percent of energy from renewables at the moment," Jahnatek
said during a joint press conference with the EU's energy
commissioner Andris Piebalgs.


"By 2010 we aim to arrive at 4.0 percent, by 2015 at 8.0 percent
and by 2020, 12.0 percent," he added.


Slovakia's renewable efforts could exceed those targets if it
found "more effective means" of producing such energy, he said,
adding that hydro, biomass and geothermal energy offered the best
prospects.


Piebalgs said Slovakia "has a far greater potential to make use
of renewables" than currently.


EU heads of state agreed at their spring summit for renewables to
account for 20.0 percent of energy consumption across the
27-country bloc by 2020. Individual targets for countries
allowing the EU to achieve that overall goal were not set at the
summit.
