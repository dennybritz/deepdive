Riot police released tear gas and fired flares in an effort to
disperse about 3,000 protesters who hurled rocks and bottles at
the president's office in this Central Asian state on Thursday.


A part of the crowd dispersed but were attempting to regroup and
return to the presidential office, a vast concrete building known
as the White House.


Another 4,000 protesters were demonstrating in nearby streets, an
AFP reporter said.


Tempers rose after the demonstrators gathered around the White
House shouting insults at several hundred riot police ranged
inside its fence.


Demonstrators shouted "We will take the White House" and "Down
with Bakiyev," referring to President Kurmanbek Bakiyev.


This ex-Soviet state has experienced almost weekly demonstrations
since a 2005 uprising in which president Askar Akayev was ousted.


"We are at the point of breakthrough. We will force Bakiyev to
resign," one of the protest leaders, parliament deputy Melis
Eshimka, told AFP.


A police official at the scene, Oistal Ismonov, told AFP the
protesters were "essentially young people behaving aggressively,
who are out of the control of the protest organizers and whose
sole goal is to take the White House."


Opposition politicians have repeatedly accused Bakiyev of failing
to follow through on promises of democratic reform made at the
time of his predecessor's ouster.


Bakiyev has made some concessions to the opposition, appointing
Almaz Atambayev, a moderate critic of his rule, as prime minister
last month.
