Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Thursday slammed the
country's football federation for failing in a bid to host the
Euro 2012 championships jointly with Hungary.


"I expect the football federation not to close their eyes to the
fact that we experienced a debacle," Sanader said during a
regular government session.


"We expect that the football organisation provides answers, not
to politicians, but to the public.


"We expect answers to the question: 'Why has this debacle
occurred?'"


Croatian officials at all levels had done their part in preparing
for the candidacy, barring those of the football federation,
stressed Sanader.


European football's governing body UEFA on Wednesday chose Poland
and Ukraine to host the Euro 2012 championships.


The decision was a major shock as world champions Italy was the
hot favorite.


Observers had thought the Croatia-Hungary bid stood a good chance
in the event that UEFA was looking east for the host.


Poland and Ukraine had been given minimal chances of success,
mainly owing to the distance which separates the two countries,
poor roads and stadiums, and political turmoil in Ukraine.
