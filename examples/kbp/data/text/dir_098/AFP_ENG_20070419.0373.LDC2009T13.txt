West Indies were 17-2 after 10 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against Bangaldesh at Kensington Oval here on
Thursday.


Shivnarine Chanderpaul was on seven with Marlon Samuels on two.


Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar won the toss and elected to
field in a match featuring two sides who had no chance of making
the semi-finals.


Devon Smith was the first man out bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza for
five in the third over with fellow opener Chris Gayle again
failing making just one before he was lbw to Syed Rasel to make
the total 8-2 in the fourth over.


Both teams made two changes from their line-ups from the last
matches.


The West Indies brought back spearhead Jerome Taylor and Marlon
Samuels in place of Ian Bradshaw and Kieron Pollard who both
played in the defeat against South Africa.


Bangladesh dropped batsman Shahriar Nafees and paceman Shahadat
Hossain who both played in their defeat against Ireland, bringing
back fit-again paceman Syed Rasel and batsman Javed Omar.
