The authoritative Le Monde newspaper on Thursday called for
voters to make a straight left-right wing choice in the French
presidential election and take Socialist Segolene Royal into the
runoff vote against rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy.


In an editorial three days ahead of the first round of voting,
the centre-left newspaper implicitly called for eliminating
centrist Francois Bayrou from the race.


The two leading candidates from Sunday's first round will contest
the runoff on May 6.


"There is on political offer two options: that of Nicolas
Sarkozy, who is from the right and from the outgoing majority,
which seems quite sure of itself; we must therefore hope that the
second, from the left and embodied by Segolene Royal, be present
in the second round to guarantee the chances of a real choice,"
wrote Le Monde.


Bayrou, who holds third place in opinion polls, has proposed a
unity government made up of moderates from the left and right.


Le Monde argued that it was important for two differing "visions
of society" to be represented in the runoff so voters can "say
clearly where they want to go, decide on a certain idea of our
future and of our life together."
