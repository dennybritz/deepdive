Northampton centre David Quinlan announced his retirement from
rugby on Thursday after being told he risked brain damage if he
continued to play.


The former Ireland back called time on his career following
discussions with his neurosurgeon. His move comes just four days
after his team-mate Steve Thompson, the former England hooker,
retired because of a neck injury which meant he risked paralysis
by playing on.


"It is with great regret that I have had to end my career in this
way," Quinland said. "Rugby has been a massive part of my life
for many years, and I am going to miss it greatly."


Quinlan joined Northampton from Leinster in 2005, going on to
make 35 appearances. Saints head coach Paul Grayson said: "It is
a cruel way for his career to finish this way. He put his body on
the line time and again for the club. We are losing a leader as
well as a well-liked member of the squad."
