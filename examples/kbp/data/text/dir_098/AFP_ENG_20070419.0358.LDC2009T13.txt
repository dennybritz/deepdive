Anyone who feels they need to shed a few kilos might want to
consider the efforts of New Yorker Michael Hebranko, who has lost
a quarter of ton since vowing to battle the bulge.


Hebranko, who has been in a New York City medical facility for
more than a year, was awarded a medal for his feat on Wednesday
after dropping from more than 450 kilos (1,000 pounds) at one
point to his current weight of 207 kilos (458 pounds).


"I thank God for every day I'm alive," Hebranko told the New York
Daily News, recounting his regime of a 1,400-calorie diet and
moderate exercise.


"The biggest battle is in my head," he said. "I don't feel full
when I eat."


"My whole life I've searched for satisfaction from food," he told
the newspaper. "I've learned the satisfaction I'm searching for
isn't in food. I get satisfaction from family and friends."


Several years ago, authorities had to remove part of a wall from
Hebranko's house and forklift him out into a specially-enlarged
ambulance to take him to a Manhattan hospital for obesity
treatment.


Since last year he has been at a rehabilitation center in New
York, where his diet includes chicken, fish and salad.


"I feel different without a doubt," Hebranko said. "I feel
younger. I have more energy."
