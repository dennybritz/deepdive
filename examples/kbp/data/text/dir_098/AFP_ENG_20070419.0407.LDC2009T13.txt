The World Trade Organisation has postponed the first meeting on
Iraq's bid to join the body, which had been scheduled for Friday,
trade sources said.


The move followed an official request from Iraq. No specific date
has been set yet for the postponed meeting, the sources said
Thursday.


Iraq applied to join the global trade club in October 2004. Its
oil-dependent economy has been ravaged by decades of sanctions
followed by spiralling violence and unemployment since the US-led
invasion in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein.


No reason was given for the postponement. The meeting would mark
the start of negotiations to draw up an agreement on Iraqi
accession to the WTO.
