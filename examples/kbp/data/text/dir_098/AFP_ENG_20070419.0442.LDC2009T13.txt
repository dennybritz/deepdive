The two main Nigerian opposition parties said Thursday that they
would not carry out a threatened boycott of Saturday's
presidential election.


The All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and the Action Congress (AC)
announced separately that they will take part in polls to find a
new head of state and legislative assembly.


The poll should produce the African giant's first civilian-to-
civilian power transfer since independence in 1960. But it has
been preceded by widespread violence and political turmoil over
moves to stop a vice president from taking part.


AC spokesman Alhaji Lai Mohammed said that after the ANPP
announcement that it would take part in Saturday's polls, it
would be "meaningless" for AC to refuse to take part.


The two parties were among 18 who threatened on Tuesday to
boycott the election unless it was postponed.


The opposition parties were meeting Thursday to decide whether to
field a united candidate in the presidential election.
