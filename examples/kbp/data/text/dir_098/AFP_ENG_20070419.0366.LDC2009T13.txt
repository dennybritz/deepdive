Germany is hoping to achieve a balanced budget by 2010, Finance
Minister Peer Steinbrueck said on Thursday.


"That is a realistic and serious target," Steinbrueck told
journalists at a briefing here.


Under terms of the European Stability and Growth Pact, eurozone
countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of
3.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)&gt;.


Germany, the pact's main architect, had been in breach of that
rule every year since 2002.


But a booming economy and bountiful tax revenues enabled Berlin
to report a deficit ratio of 1.7 percent last year. And the
government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in
2007.


However, the five leading German economic research institutes are
more optimistic, predicting that a balanced budget, which is
deficit ratio of zero, is achieveable by 2008.


In their traditional spring report, the institutes -- DIW in
Berlin, Ifo in Munich, IfW in Kiel, IHW in Halle and RWI in Essen
-- sharply upgraded their forecasts for German growth this year
to 2.4 percent from 1.4 percent.


And the institutes said growth would maintain its momentum again
next year when GDP would similarly expand by 2.4 percent.


The insitutes predicted that the German public deficit would
decline from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to just 0.6 percent of
GDP in 2007. And Germany was expected to achieve a balanced
budget in 2008, they said.
