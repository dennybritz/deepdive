Germany's highest judicial court on Thursday ruled that the
German branch of the Internet auctioneer eBay must try to prevent
attempts to sell fake Rolex watches on its website.


The Swiss luxury brand took eBay to court after a number of fake
Rolex watches were offered for sale on the website between June
2000 and January 2001.


The court in Karslruhe in southwestern Germany said that eBay was
obliged to withdraw purported offers of Rolex watches immediately
if there was reason to suspect that they were counterfeit, or if
it was alerted to the fact by Rolex.


"The defendant is obliged to take all reasonable and technically
possible steps to ensure that fake Rolex watches are not put on
auction on its site," the court added.


A spokeswoman for eBay in Germany, Maike Fuest, said: "We have
for a long time been trying to spot fakes and we are constantly
improving our methods of doing so."


"It is our own interest to keep our site counterfeit-free," she
added.


The starting price for genuine second-hand Rolex watches offered
on eBay is around 1,000 euros (1,360 dollars).
