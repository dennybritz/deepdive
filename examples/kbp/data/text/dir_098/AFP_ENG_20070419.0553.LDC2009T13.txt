UN chief Ban Ki-moon Thursday voiced outrage at the latest deadly
bombings in Baghdad and urged Iraq's political and religious
leaders to find a way out of "this destructive spiral  of
violence."


Following a string of bombings that left nearly 200 people dead
Wednesday and another deadly attack Thursday in the Iraqi
capital, Ban "expresses his outrage at the callousness and scale
with which innocent civilians are being slaughtered on an almost
daily basis," UN spokeswoman Michele Montas said.


The UN secretary general, who is currently in Europe, "calls
urgently on the political and religious leaders of Iraq to come
together in a spirit of dialogue and mutual respect in order to
find a way out of this destructive spiral of violence," she added
in a statement.


Earlier Thursday, a suicide car bomber killed 12 people outside a
Baghdad take- away shop, one day after 190 people died in a
bombing blitz that brought into question the US-backed security
plan for the capital.


The latest bomber blew up his car in the central Jadriyah
district -- a majority Shiite area -- killing 12 and wounding 28
and also setting ablaze a nearby truck loaded with gas cylinders,
a security official said.
