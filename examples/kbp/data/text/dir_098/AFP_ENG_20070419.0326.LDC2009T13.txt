German pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant Bayer said late on
Wednesday that it and Schering-Plough had received approval to
co-market Schering-Plough's anti- cholesterol drug in Japan.


Bayer said in a statement that the Japanese Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare had approved Zetia for launch in Japan.


The drug would be co-marketed by Bayer Yakuhin and Schering-
Plough's Japanese arm, the statement said.


The co-marketing agreement was part of an alliance announced by
Bayer and Schering-Plough in 2004, the statement said.


The total number of patients in Japan suffering from high
cholesterol is estimated to be around 30 million.
