India has banned all imports and exports of products to North
Korea and Iran that could aid their suspect nuclear programmes, a
report said Thursday.


The ban was notified in India's foreign trade policy unveiled by
Commerce Minister Kamal Nath on Thursday and is is in compliance
with UN Security Council resolutions, the Press Trust of India
news agency reported.


"The government has prohibited direct and indirect export and
import of materials, goods and technology which could contribute
to North Korea's nuclear- related, ballistic missile-related or
other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes," the report
quoted the policy document as saying.


New Delhi has "also prohibited direct or indirect export and
import of all items, materials, goods and technology which could
contribute to Iran's enrichment-related, reprocessing or heavy
water-related activities, or to development of its nuclear
weapons delivery systems," it added.


India maintains diplomatic relations with North Korea, and had
also incurred international isolation after carrying out nuclear
tests in 1998.


Energy-hungry India, which is negotiating a civilian nuclear
energy deal with the United States that will give New Delhi
access to previously forbidden technology, has repeatedly called
for talks to resolve the row over Iran's suspect nuclear
ambitions.
