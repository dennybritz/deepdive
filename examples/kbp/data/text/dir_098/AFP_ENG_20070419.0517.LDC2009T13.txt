A baggage handler at Dublin Airport narrowly escaped being sealed
in the cargo hold of an Aer Lingus flight to New York -- thanks
to his mobile phone, an air accident report said Thursday.


The Airbus 330 was taxi-ing for take-off on December 28, 2005
when his phone call raised the alarm and air traffic control
recalled the plane so he could be freed.


"This was a serious incident," according to an air accident
report by transport ministry inspector John Hughes, adding it was
"fortunate" the handler had a mobile phone with him.


"Cases have occurred where loaders have been inadvertently locked
in a hold. Some years ago, a loader was locked in a hold on a
two-hour flight from Philadelphia to Chicago.


"This was a traumatic event for this person," the report says.


Hughes found there were no written procedures or formal training
given on closing up flights or dealing with a situation where a
member of staff has been shut up in an aircraft.


His safety recommendations call for procedures to be put in place
for closing up an aircraft and for late removal of baggage.


There should also be a communications system that would enable
the ramp agent directing loading to be immediately alerted if an
emergency arises.


The report says the baggage handler, who was leading two teams of
loading crews for the 325 passenger flight, was locked in the
hold following confusion about a number of items of luggage.


There was "a clear breakdown in communications," it said.
