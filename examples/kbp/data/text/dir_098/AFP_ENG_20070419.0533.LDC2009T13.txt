Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of
Mediaset television group's parent Fininvest, said Thursday he
was ready to buy a non- controlling stake in Telecom Italia.


"We were asked if we wanted to take part in an Italian consortium
and my company said that it is ready to intervene equally
alongside other investors in order to keep such an important
group in Italian hands," Berlusconi said.


Mediaset chairman Fedele Confalonieri said his group was
interested in Telecom Italia because "it makes industrial sense."


Confalonieri said the regulatory framework barred his group from
taking a significant stake in Telecom Italia because the telecoms
group owned three TV stations.


"We could be involved by taking a stake which would not make us a
major shareholder," he said.


US telecoms giant AT&T pulled out of talks on Monday to take
control of Telecom Italia over concerns that the Italian
government could interfere in the regulation of the company.


The government is preparing plans that would in effect require
Telecom Italia to keep its fixed line business separate from
other activities, which would deprive the company of a key asset
and make it less attractive to a suitor.
