British designer John Galliano has beeen ordered to pay 200,000
euros in damages to photographer William Klein for plagiarizing
his technique in an ad campaign, court officials said Thursday.


The Galliano advertisement campaign splashed in French and
international fashion magazines featured black-and-white photos,
displayed like a contact sheet with a two glossy dotted lines on
top and at the bottom.


Judge Claude Vallet of the Paris civil court ruled that
Galliano's fashion house had "deliberately borrowed the
composition of the work to present the photographs of its models,
which is illegal without the authorization of Mr William Klein."


Klein said in an interview to Le Monde newspaper that he
discovered the fashion ads when a friend remarked to him:
"William, why did you do this lame work for Galliano?".


Klein lodged the lawsuit in the Paris court on February 26,
demanding 640,000 euros (870,000 dollars) in damages for
plagiarizing his painted contact sheets technique.


Lawyer Michel-Paul Escande, acting on behalf of Galliano, said
his client had appealed against the decision rendered on March
28. A date has yet to be set for the appeal hearing.


Galliano, who designs under his own label and also for Christian
Dior, pulled the plug on the ad campaign shortly after the
lawsuit was filed.
