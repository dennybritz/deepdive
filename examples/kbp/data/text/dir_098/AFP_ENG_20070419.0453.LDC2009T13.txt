A Turkish court has fined three French vacationers for the
killing of a sailboat skipper who they said threatened to blow up
the boat they were in, their lawyer said Thursday.


David Bassard, his mother Marylene and his wife Sylvie appeared
in court Wednesday in the Mediterranean city of Fethiye for the
killing of Friad Hichan on August 22, said Taner Aktop. They had
argued that the killing was self- defence.


The court issued prison sentences of 13 months plus 10 days for
the three, but commuted the sentences to fines of 8,100 Turkish
lira (4,400 euros, 6,000 dollars) each, Aktop said.


Hichan was a Moroccan sailor hired by the family to pilot their
boat. An altercation occurred on the trip off the coast of
Turkey, resulting in the strangulation of Hichan and serious
injuries to Bassard's father, who was stabbed.


The family said the argument began between Bassard's father, Max,
and Hichan over a missing dinghy.


According to the lawyer, the argument led to Hicham stabbing Max
Bassard. Hicham then poured gas on the deck and threatened to
light it, Aktop said.


The family responded by tying him up by the legs, arms and
throat, the lawyer said.


The court accepted the family's self-defense argument, but ruled
that they had used too much force in response, Aktop said. The
family plans to appeal.
