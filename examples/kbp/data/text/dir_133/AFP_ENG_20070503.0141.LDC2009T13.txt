Bradford Bulls have signed New Zealand international winger Tame
Tupou from the Brisbane Broncos as a replacement for Lesley
Vainikolo, who is expected to join rugby union club Gloucester.


Tupou, 24, has agreed a four-year contract with the English Super
League club and is expected to arrive in north England next week.


"Bradford are doing great at the moment. I've seen a couple of
games already and they're at the top of the table," Tupou told
the Bradford Telegraph and Argus.


"Hopefully I can get back to playing some good footy but I just
want to get there and concentrate on training well first."


Although he was Brisbane's joint-top try-scorer last season,
Tupou was left out of their Grand Final-winning side and did not
face St Helens in the World Club Challenge in February.


Tupou, who played in the Tri-Nations last year, is the latest in
a long line of Kiwis to play at Odsal following on from the likes
of Vainikolo, Shontayne Hape, Joe Vagana and Robbie and Henry
Paul.


Vainikolo, who has an amazing try tally of 140 in 144 appearances
for the Bulls, is expected to complete a cross-code move to
Gloucester at the end of May and could play alongside Tupou in
the short-term.
