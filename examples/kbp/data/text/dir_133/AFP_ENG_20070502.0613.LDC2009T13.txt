A US man accused of raping his young daughter and posting the
video on the Internet was arrested Tuesday in Hong Kong, the US
Marshals Service announced Wednesday.


Kenneth John Freeman, 44, was "one of the world's most notorious
accused child molesters" and on the US Marshals 15 Most Wanted
fugitive list, the Service said in a statement.


"Internet scenes allegedly showing the girl being raped by her
father became one of the most widely downloaded child pornography
videos in recent years," the statement read.


Freeman was "an avid competitive bodybuilder and computer expert,
and formerly worked as a reserve sheriff's deputy" in the
northwestern state of Washington, the statement read.


He was the subject of a global manhunt in 2005 after he fled
following charges filed against him in federal and local courts.


In December Freeman was featured on the popular television show
"America's Most Wanted," and his daughter, now a teenager, went
on TV to tell her story.


A team of law enforcement officials tracked Freeman to Suzhou,
China, where he apparently was working for a US firm.


He was arrested Tuesday when he went to Hong Kong, and now faces
extradition and US federal and Washington state charges


"No extradition treaty exists between the People's Republic of
China and the United States, but when the Chinese were informed
about Freeman they agreed to help," the statement read.


It added that there still was an extradition treaty between Hong
Kong and Washington, even though Hong Kong reverted from British
to Chinese rule in 1997.
