The dollar turned flat against the yen and slipped versus the
euro in late Asian trade Thursday, having earlier found some
support from better-than-expected US economic data, dealers said.


Trade was relatively quiet because the Japanese markets are
closed Thursday and Friday for a public holiday.


At 2:50 pm (0650 GMT), the dollar was at 120.09 yen, up from
120.08 in late New York trade Wednesday.


The euro was at 1.3616 dollars, up from 1.3590.


The Institute of Supply Management index of US industrial
activity rose to 54.7 from 50.9 in March, beating market
expectations for a slight gain to 51.0 and boosting optimism
about the health of the world's biggest economy, dealers said.


They said the dollar was also boosted by US factory orders rising
3.1 percent in March, well ahead of the expected 2.1 percent
gain.


The growth in factory orders "is suggesting corporate spending is
on the rebound after a period of cost cutting and inventory
reduction," said John Kicklighter at Forex Capital Markets.


All eyes are now on Friday's US non-farm payrolls report, seen as
one of the best indicators, for further clues on the health of
the US economy.


The market is expecting the report to show 100,000 new jobs
created so a weaker figure might lead to a fresh sell-off in the
dollar, dealers said.


Against key Asian units, the dollar rose to 47.62 Philippine
pesos from 47.56 in late Asian trade Wednesday and to 33.306
Taiwan dollars from 33.302.


It fell to 1.5228 Singapore dollars from 1.5234, to 926.9 South
Korean won from 930.1, to 32.60 Thai baht from 32.74 and to
9,042.5 Indonesian rupiah from 9,078.
