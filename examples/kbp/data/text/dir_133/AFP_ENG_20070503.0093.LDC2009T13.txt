The head of Israel's main opposition party Benjamin Netanyahu on
Thursday called on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to quit for the
first time since an inquiry blasted his leadership in the Lebanon
war.


"It is clear that this government has lost the little confidence
that the people had in it," Netanyahu, a former premier, told
lawmakers from his Likud party.


"It is clear that the only thing is left to do is to give the
people the opportunity to have their last word," he said, calling
on Olmert to step down and called for early elections.


Netanyahu was due to address an extraordinary parliament session
later on Thursday in which the beleaguered Olmert was likely to
face more calls to resign.
