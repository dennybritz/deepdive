A bomb struck a bus taking Afghan soldiers to work in the capital
Kabul early Thursday, killing the driver and wounding 14 people,
police said.


"The blast wounded 14 people and the driver was martyred," the
city's criminal investigation chief Alishah Paktiawal said.
"Seven of the wounded are ANA (Afghan National Army) personnel
and seven are civilians."


"It was a remote-controlled bomb placed in a cart," army Colonel
Ali Reza said at the site of the blast in the north of the city.


The blast blew away one side of the bus and shattered all the
vehicle's windows. Other vehicles in the area were damaged.


A shopkeeper said he was opening his store for the day's business
when the explosion happened. "I saw several wounded people," he
said.


The Taliban-led insurgency that is gripping much of Afghanistan
rarely penetrates the heavily secured capital, but the city has
suffered several attacks.


Late Wednesday a senator was assassinated outside his home by
unknown gunmen.
