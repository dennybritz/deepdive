Two people were killed in heavy rains in Sri Lanka's capital
Wednesday while flash floods caused traffic jams and disrupted
ceremonies to welcome back the national cricket team.


Colombo National Hospital spokeswoman Pushpa Soysa said one woman
died after being swept away in the flood waters while another was
struck by lightning as she stepped off a bus.


The meteorology department said Colombo received over 12
centimetres (nearly five inches) of rain during the 24 hours to
Thursday morning.


Heavy rains did not deter cricket fans who lined up along the
road leading from the international airport to Colombo, a
distance of 35 kilometres (21 miles), to greet the team who
emerged runners-up in the eight-week long World Cup tournament.


Official ceremonies were however disrupted, with organisers
having to shift the welcoming party indoors to Sri Lanka Cricket
offices from the open air Independence Square.


Motorists were struck in lengthy traffic jams, while most of
Colombo's roads were underwater, partly due to the lack of
maintenance to the city's drainage systems.


Colombo's sewer and storm water systems were constructed between
1906 and 1913 and designed to serve a population of around
400,000.


"There are over 700,000 residents in Colombo, and city
authorities don't allocate funds for maintenance. That is why the
whole city goes under water during a short burst of heavy rain,"
a meteorology department official said.
