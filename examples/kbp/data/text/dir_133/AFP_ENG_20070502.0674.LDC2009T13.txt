The dollar was firmer against the yen but slipped versus the euro
in Asian trade Thursday, finding some support from better-than-
expected US economic data, dealers said.


Trade was relatively quiet because the Japanese markets are
closed Thursday and Friday for a public holiday.


At 11:20 am (0300 GMT), the dollar was at 120.23 yen, up from
120.08 in late New York trade Wednesday.


The euro was at 1.3596 dollars, up from 1.3590.


"The dollar has firmed up overall," said Jason Sie, head of spot
forex dealing at French bank BNP Paribas in Singapore.


"The ISM figures was the kickoff for the reversal of the dollar,"
he said, referring to manufacturing data from the Institute of
Supply Management (ISM) earlier in the week.


The ISM's index of US industrial activity rose to 54.7 from 50.9
in March, beating market expectations for a slight gain to 51.0,
raising optimism about the health of the world's biggest economy,
dealers said.


Dealers said the dollar was also boosted by US factory orders
rising 3.1 percent in March, well ahead of the expected 2.1
percent gain.


The growth in factory orders "is suggesting corporate spending is
on the rebound after a period of cost cutting and inventory
reduction," said John Kicklighter at Forex Capital Markets.


All eyes are now on Friday's US non-farm payrolls report, seen as
one of the best indicators, for further clues on the health of
the US economy.


The market is expecting the report to show 100,000 new jobs
created so a weaker figure might lead to a fresh sell-off in the
dollar, dealers said.
