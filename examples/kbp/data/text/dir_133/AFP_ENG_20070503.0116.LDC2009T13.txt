Six people including two policemen have been killed in fresh
violence in Sri Lanka's embattled north and east, military
officials said Thursday.


Tamil Tiger rebels shot dead a constable in the northern district
of Vavuniya on Thursday while another policeman was gunned on
Wednesday evening in the eastern region of Batticaloa, officials
said.


They said three civilians were also shot dead by unidentified
gunmen in Vavuniya on Thursday.


The defence ministry said a Tiger guerrilla was shot dead when he
tried to infiltrate an army defence line in the Jaffna peninsula
on Wednesday.


The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for Sri
Lanka's minority Tamil community. The conflict has killed more
than 60,000 people over some three decades.
