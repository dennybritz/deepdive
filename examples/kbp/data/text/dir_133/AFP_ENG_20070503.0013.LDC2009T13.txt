A Filipina overseas worker on death row in Saudi Arabia for
nearly 15 years has been freed, Philippine officials said
Thursday.


Sarah Dematera was handed over to the Philippine embassy in
Riyadh on Wednesday after President Gloria Arroyo pleaded for her
release last year while on a state visit.


Dematera was sentenced to death by a Saudi court in November 1993
after she was found guilty of beating her female employer to
death.


At the time she had a four-year-old daughter and under Saudi law
could not be executed until the child reached the age of 18.


Arroyo pleaded Dematera's case with Prince Muhammad Bin Abdulaziz
Al Saud, governor of the Kingdom's eastern province, when she
visited Saudi Arabia in May 2006, the presidential palace said.


In a statement President Arroyo said she was happy for Dematera
and her family and thanked the Saudi authorities.


Arroyo also thanked the family of the victim for forgiving
Dematera and accepting a payment of 48 million pesos (about one
million dollars) in "blood money for their tremendous personal
loss."


More than eight million Filipinos work abroad, including one
million in the Middle East.


Last year Filipino workers sent home more than 12.8 billion
dollars representing about 14 percent of gross domestic product.


Since Arroyo's visit last year more than 1,000 Filipino workers
in Saudi Arabia have been repatriated after fleeing their
employers over issues such as unpaid salaries and sexual abuse,
according to Labour Secretary Arturo Brion.
