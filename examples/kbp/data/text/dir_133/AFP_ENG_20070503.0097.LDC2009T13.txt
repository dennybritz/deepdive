Two armed robbers who raped a Zimbabwean lawmaker during a break-
in at her home were each sentenced to 29 years in prison, state
media reported Thursday.


Lovemore Mumvuri, 37, and Shepherd Ngulube, 31, sentenced to 15
years each for rape and 14 years for armed robbery, the state-run
Herald said. The sentences will be consecutive.


Prosecutor Angeline Sithole said the pair used an axe to break
into the MP's home to the east of Harare, and then ransacked the
house before taking turns to rape the lawmaker who represents the
ruling ZANU-PF party.


They made off with various property including a hi-fi, pots,
pans, mobile phones and blankets altogether worth 37 million
Zimbabwean dollars (150,000 US dollars).


Some of the property was recovered in neighbouring Mozambique.


Sentencing the pair, regional magistrate Gladys Pise said: "Rape
is a very grave offence, especially in this case when it is
committed on a respected member of society and you did not (only)
demean and traumatise her, but shocked her as well."


The two robbers are also facing other charges including one of
gang-raping a 13 -year-old schoolgirl who later died while
waiting to be treated at a local clinic and killing a security
guard.
