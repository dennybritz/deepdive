US and Iraqi forces have killed the head of the so-called Islamic
State of Iraq, an umbrella group of Sunni insurgents which
includes Al-Qaeda, Iraq's deputy interior minister said Thursday.


Minister Hussein Ali Kamal said the insurgent leader known as
Omar al-Baghdadi was killed in western Baghdad. "His body is
under the control of the interior ministry. His body has been
identified," he told AFP.


Separately, US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Garver
said the military would hold a news conference later on Thursday
to announce a "recent success against a senior leader of Al-Qaeda
in Iraq."
