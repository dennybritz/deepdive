Hong Kong share prices closed 1.44 percent higher Thursday,
extending gains on hopes an upcoming government land auction will
attract strong interest from leading developers and push property
prices higher, dealers said.


They said the market also got a strong boost from HSBC, which
continued to benefit from news of a significant investment in the
global baning giant by a private-equity firm owned by Dubai ruler
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.


The Hang Seng Index jumped 293.09 points to 20,681.58, off a low
of 20,555.57 and a high of 20,739.03. Turnover was 54.44 billion
dollars (7.0 billion US).
