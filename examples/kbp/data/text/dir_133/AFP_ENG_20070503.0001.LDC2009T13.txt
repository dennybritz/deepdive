Portland Trail Blazers guard Brandon Roy was named the National
Basketball Association's Rookie of the Year on Wednesday.


In balloting released Wednesday, Roy was the runaway winner,
receiving 127 of 128 first-place votes and 638 points from a
panel of sportswriters and broadcasters in North America.


In the last 30 years, the only unanimous choices have been David
Robinson in 1990 and Ralph Sampson in 1984.


Roy is the first Trail Blazer in 35 years to win the award.
Sidney Wicks won in 1972, one year after Geoff Petrie shared the
award with Boston's Dave Cowens in 1971.


The other first-place vote went to Toronto Raptors forward Andrea
Bargnani, the top overall pick in the 2006 draft who finished
with 264 points.


Selected sixth overall by Minnesota and traded to Portland in a
draft-day deal, Roy led all rookies in scoring at 16.8 points per
game.


He also was tops among rookies in assists (4.0) and minutes
(35.4) per game.
