England's Mark Selby clinched the fourth semi-final berth in the
world snooker championships here with a marathon 13-12 win over
compatriot Ali Carter.


Carter, world ranked 15, was never ahead in the match but shared
the first eight frames in a topsy-turvy opening session.


But Selby, who had never been past the second round in previous
visits to the Crucible, picked up five of the next six frames to
take command.


Carter picked up the last frame of Wednesday afternoon's session
but was still 6-9 down going into the evening.


Battling Carter levelled at 11-11 only for Selby to keep his
nerve with a 69 break to edge in front again at 12-11.


But Selby suffered a wicked kick on the black and Carter
capitalised to tie it up at 12-12.


It was Carter's turn to suffer a stroke of bad luck with an in-
off when well placed.


But Selby refused to buckle and whe he got back among the balls
wrapped up victory as the game entered its 10th hour.


He now faces 2005 champion Shaun Murphy in an all-English semi-
final, while the other last four match sees Scots John Higgins
and Stephen Maguire go head-to- head.
