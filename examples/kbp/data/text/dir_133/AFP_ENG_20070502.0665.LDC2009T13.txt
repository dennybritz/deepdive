US-based Texas Instruments said Thursday it is investing one
billion dollars to expand its operations in the Philippines.


The investment was announced by Philippine President Gloria
Arroyo and senior officials of the Dallas-based firm, the world's
biggest producer of chips for mobile telephones.


TI said work on the new site would begin in July or August at the
Clark Economic Zone, a former US air base north of Manila, with
construction and the installation of equipment to be completed by
the end of next year.


The company already has a 28 year-old production facility at the
northern mountain resort of Baguio.


"The competition for this investment was fierce but we are
thankful that Texas Instruments finally chose the Philippines,"
Arroyo said.


Kevin Ritchie, TI senior vice president for technology and
manufacturing, said the company looked at "various countries and
various locations" based on the availability and quality of the
labour force as well as investment incentives offered by the
potential hosts.


"It really comes down to the quality of the Baguio operations,"
he said, calling the facility as "one of the best sites we have."
