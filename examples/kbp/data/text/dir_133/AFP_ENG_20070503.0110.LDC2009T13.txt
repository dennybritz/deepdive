Germany's second-largest bank Commerzbank has sold its one
percent stake in the German stock market operator Deutsche
Boerse, a spokesman said in the Handelsblatt newspaper on
Thursday.


"We sold our share in the first quarter within the framework of
the active management of our portfolio," the spokesman told
Handelsblatt.


Commerzbank said in June 2006 it had purchased the shareholding
in order to support the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse exchange,
which was in negotiations on a merger with the pan-European
operator Euronext at the time.


Deutsche Boerse failed in its attempts to buy both Euronext and
the London Stock Exchange, but said last week it was setting its
sights on a 2.8-billion-dollar (2.1-billion-euro) bid for the New
York-based International Securities Exchange, the second-largest
US options market.


Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, retains a one-percent
stake in Deutsche Boerse.
