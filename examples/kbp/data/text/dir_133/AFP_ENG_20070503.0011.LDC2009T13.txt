Three US soldiers were killed in separate roadside bomb attacks
while on patrol in Baghdad, the military announced late
Wednesday.


A woman soldier was severely wounded when a bomb exploded under
her vehicle in western Baghdad, and she subsequently died of her
wounds.


Another two soldiers died and several were wounded by a bomb
targeting their vehicle while they searched a southern Baghdad
neighbourhood for booby traps.


"The unit was conducting route clearance operations in the area
when the attack occurred," the military said, adding that others
were wounded in the explosion.


US and Iraqi troops have poured into the capital in recent weeks
in a bid to pacify the war torn city, exposing them to much
greater risk from the bombs and booby traps that litter the
streets of the capital.


The deaths bring total US casualties since the March 2003
invasion to least 3,355, according to an AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.
