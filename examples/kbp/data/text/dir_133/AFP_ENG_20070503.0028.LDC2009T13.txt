Tycoon Ananda Krishnan and associates will spend at least 39.47
billion ringgit (11.54 billion dollars) to privatise mobile
operator Maxis in what could be Malaysia's biggest corporate
deal.


Binariang GSM, an investment holding firm and special purpose
vehicle for Ananda's Usaha Tegas and affiliates, said through
CIMB Investment bank it would offer 15.60 ringgit for the
outstanding 2.53 billion shares in the company that Ananda does
not already own.


"The consideration for the offer, to be satistifed in cash, is
15.60 ringgit," CIMB said in a notice.


CIMB said Binariang on Wednesday had obtained "irrevocable
undertakings" from 15 firms who own a total 59.53 percent of
Maxis to accept the offer.


Binariang would also buy shares owned by employees in Maxis,
Malaysia's largest mobile operator, but CIMB did not give any
figures.


Maxis shares last traded at 13.00 ringgit before they were
suspended on the Malaysian bourse Monday after reports about the
deal broke.
