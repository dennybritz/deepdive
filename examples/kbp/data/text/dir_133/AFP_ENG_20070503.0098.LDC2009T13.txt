Pirates have hijacked three Finnish fishing vessels off the coast
of Somalia's semi-autonomous northern region of Puntland, a
maritime official said Thursday.


"We are still investigating the nationality and the number of the
crew as well as the ownership of the vessels," Andrew Mwangura,
of the Kenyan branch of the Seafarers Assistance Programme, told
AFP.


He said an unspecified number of gunmen hijacked the boats early
Wednesday.


Pirate attacks have increased in recent weeks off the coast of
Somalia after dying out during six months of strict Islamist rule
in southern and central Somalia at the end of last year.


There were scores of pirate attacks in the unpatrolled waters off
the 3,700-kilometre (2,300-mile) Somali coastline between March
2005 and June last year.


The Islamists were defeated by the Ethiopian-backed forces of
Somalia's transitional government four months ago, although
remnant Islamists and clan fighters have fought back in deadly
battles in Mogadishu in recent weeks.


Puntland declared itself autonomous from the rest of Somalia in
August 1998 under the leaderhip of Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, the
current president of the Somali interim government.
