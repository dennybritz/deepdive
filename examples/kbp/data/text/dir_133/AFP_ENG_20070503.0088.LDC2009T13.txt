Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived back in Tokyo Thursday
after a week- long tour of the United States and the Middle East.


Abe held talks with US President George W. Bush on North Korea
and Tokyo's expanding global role and sought to strengthen energy
security in his visits to the oil-rich Gulf nations of Qatar,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.


In Egypt, on the final leg of his Middle East tour, Abe and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak agreed to work together in a bid
to end the crisis over Iran's nuclear ambitions and called for a
Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction.


Abe has called throughout his trip for a relationship with the
Middle East that extends beyond oil, seen as a move for realising
his vision of a more assertive Japan on the world stage.
