Polls opened Thursday for mid-term local elections in England,
Scotland and Wales seen as a test for outgoing British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's New Labour party.


Attention was focused on Scotland, where the Scottish National
Party (SNP) has promised a referendum on independence if it comes
out on top, triggering warnings of a break-up of the United
Kingdom.


In England, some 10,500 seats are up for grabs in 312 local
authorities; in Wales, voters are choosing a new 60-seat Welsh
Assembly, while in Scotland, they are voting for the 129-member
Scottish parliament.
