Leftist protesters on Wednesday seized government offices and set
up barricades in the streets Mexico's colonial city of Oaxaca, a
popular tourist destination that was rocked by deadly clashes
last year.


Several thousands of people, many of them teachers, took part in
the protest, seizing about 30 public offices and some bank
offices, organizers said.


The protesters demand better pay and want Oaxaca state Governor
Ulises Ruiz to step down over alleged corruption and
mismanagement.


At least 13 people died in the conflict in Oaxaca last year when
riot police clashed on several occasions with demonstrators who
had seized public buildings and set up street barricades.
