Two workers are dead and another two suffered burn injuries after
a fire broke out Thursday at US oil giant ExxonMobil's oil
refinery in Singapore, the company said.


"The fire has since been put out. We regret that two people have
died and two others injured as a result of the fire," the company
said in a statement.


The fire broke out at 1:15 am (1715 GMT) and was put out by the
Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the company and police
said.


Police said the two injured workers, who are from India and
Bangladesh, are receiving treatment for their burn injuries at
the Singapore General Hospital.


The nationalities of the two dead workers were not immediately
available, ExxonMobil said, adding the company was cooperating
with the SCDF to investigate the incident.


An ExxonMobil spokesman said production at the refinery, which
has a daily crude refining capacity of 605,000 barrels, was not
disrupted and the section of the plant affected by the fire has
been shut down.


"We continue to supply our customers," he told AFP.


The ExxonMobil refinery is located on Jurong Island, the man-made
island built by Singapore to house the country's thriving oil and
chemicals industry.


Jurong Island houses major oil companies like ExxonMobil, Shell
and ChevronTexaco, as well as petrochemical giants BASF,
Celanese, DuPont, Mitsui Chemicals and Sumitomo Chemical.
