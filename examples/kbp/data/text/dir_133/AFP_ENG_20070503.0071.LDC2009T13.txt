The oldest loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland is
expected to announce that it is renouncing violence in a
statement later Thursday.


The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is set to make the announcement
days before the restoration of power-sharing in Northern Ireland
on May 8, led by Ian Paisley's Protestant Democratic Unionists
and Gerry Adams's Catholic Sinn Fein.


Although the UVF first declared a ceasefire almost 14 years ago,
it is thought to have been responsible for several killings since
then.


The Irish Republican Army (IRA), of which Sinn Fein was once the
political wing, declared an end to its campaign of violence over
two years ago and has decommissioned its arsenal of weapons.


It is not clear whether the UVF statement will go as far as
taking weapons out of service for good.


British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish premier Bertie Ahern,
who helped broker the peace in Northern Ireland after decades of
civil unrest, have repeatedly called on loyalist paramilitaries
to shun violence and criminality.


The UVF is believed to have been responsible for several hundred
deaths during "The Troubles" which ran three decades from the
late 1960s.


Loyalists in Northern Ireland support the union with Britain and
oppose plans to incorporate the province into a united Ireland.
They usually come from a Protestant background.
