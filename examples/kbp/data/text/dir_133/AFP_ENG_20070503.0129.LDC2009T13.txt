Holcim, one the world's biggest cement makers, on Thursday
reported a 94 percent increase in its first quarter net profit to
530 million Swiss francs (331 million euros, 436 million
dollars), fuelled by the booming construction industry in Asia,
Europe and Africa.


First quarter net sales increased by 23.8 percent compared to the
same period last year to 5.73 billion Swiss francs despite a
slowdown in house building in the United States, Holcim said in a
statement.


Cement sales by volume increased by 24.5 percent to 34.6 million
tonnes with the strongest increase recorded in Asia, partly due
to the Swiss group's expanded presence in India.


Rising demand for building materials in Europe continued in a
"robust market," helped by a mild winter, the company said.


Growth in those two parts of the world offset a slowdown in
construction industry in North America.


Holcim reported that activity in the US building industry tailed
off in the first quarter due to a "marked decline" in residential
construction and "exceptionally bad building weather" in some
regions.


Holcim said the global economy was expected to continue to drive
demand in the coming months.


The Swiss group reported record results in 2006, more than
doubling its annual net profit to 2.7 billion Swiss francs.
