Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez is wrecking his country's economy
with policies which will inevitably fail, the US State
Department's number two diplomat John Negroponte said Wednesday.


"I don't see how you can go on promising literally billions of
dollars of aid to other countries while you have poverty in your
own country, while at the same time you are running down, if you
will, degrading the wealth-producing portions of your economy,
which I believe he is doing," Negroponte said.


"Sooner or later, I think that the government and people of
Venezuela are going to find that the policies that Mr. Chavez is
expending his money on are simply not going to be sustainable,"
he said.


"Sooner or later these policies will fail. Of course, the issue
is when that's gonna happen and how many effects these policies
will have along the way."


Negroponte was speaking in the wake of Chavez's announcement that
he will pull Venezuela out of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund, and after he marked Tuesday his government's
takeover of formerly foreign-controlled oil production
operations.


Formerly the Director of National Intelligence, Negroponte
announced Wednesday his first trip as deputy secretary of state
to Latin America.


During May 7-12 he plans to visit Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and
Panama to discuss trade, energy and cooperation issues.
