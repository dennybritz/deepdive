The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced Wednesday that the
country's 10th case of mad cow disease had been confirmed in a
dairy cow in British Colombia in the country's far west.


The six-year-old cow was likely infected with mad cow disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in its first year of life,
putting it in the same group as the previous cases detected in
the country, the CFIA said in a statement.


"The animal's carcass is under CFIA control, and no part of it
entered the human food or animal feed systems," the agency said.


It was the second case discovered since the beginning of the
year, and the 10th since 2003, when the United States placed an
embargo on Canadian beef due to the threat of mad cow infections.


The case was detected in the course of the government's ongoing
inspection program, which has seen some 160,000 animals checked
for mad cow since 2003.


"The surveillance results reflect an extremely low incidence of
BSE in Canada," CFIA said.
