Saudi Arabia on Thursday beheaded by the sword a man convicted of
murder, the interior ministry said in a statement carried by the
official SPA news agency.


The ministry said Saeed al-Otaibi, a Saudi national, was executed
in Riyadh for stabbing to death compatriot Mohammed al-Akili
following an argument.


The latest beheading brings to 53 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in Saudi Arabia,
which applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law. Rape,
murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can all
carry the death penalty.
