Consumer prices in Switzerland increased by 0.5 percent in April
on an annual basis, according to data released by the Federal
Statistics Office on Thursday.


The figure compared with a 0.2 percent inflation rate recorded a
month earlier.


On a month-on-month basis, inflation climbed by 1.1 percent.


The sharp monthly rise was due to seasonal factors, with a 20.7
percent increase in clothing and shoes bringing prices in the
sector back to normal after sales at the start of the year, the
office said in a statement.
