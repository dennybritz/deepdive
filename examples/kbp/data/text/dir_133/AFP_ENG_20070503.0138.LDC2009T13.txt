Estonia's relocation of a Soviet war monument has badly damaged
Russian-Estonian relations, Moscow said Thursday, as pro-Kremlin
youths demonstrated outside the Estonian embassy for the seventh
straight day.


Moving the controversial statue in Tallinn "led to seriously
negative consequences for Russian-Estonian relations," Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a statement.


Lavrov rejected Estonian criticism of a noisy and occasionally
violent demonstration by pro-Kremlin youth groups outside the
Estonian embassy.


"The Russian law enforcement bodies are taking all necessary
measures so that the actions of demonstrators... do not exceeded
the bounds of the law," he said.


Lavrov called on Estonia to launch an immediate investigation
into the police handling of riots by mostly ethnic-Russian youths
in Tallinn last week in protest at the relocation of the
controversial World War II monument.


The NATO military alliance, the United States and the European
Union have pledged their support to NATO and EU member Estonia.


The statue at the heart of the row is seen by Russians as a
memorial to Red Army soldiers who died fighting fascism but by
Estonians as a bitter reminder of 50 years of Soviet occupation.
