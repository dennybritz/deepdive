The New York Yankees top pitching prospect Phillip Hughes is
headed to the disabled list after suffering a left hamstring
injury in the seventh inning of Tuesday's 10-1 win over Texas.


In just his second career start, Hughes had not allowed a hit
through 6 1/3 innings before he was forced to leave with the
injury.


"My guess is that we're thinking in terms of four to six weeks,"
Torre said after consulting with team trainer Gene Monahan.


Rumoured to be on the hot seat after the Yankees went just 9-14
in April, Torre is getting used to this.


Wang Chien-ming, the runner-up for the 2006 American League Cy
Young Award, started the season on the disabled list.


Mike Mussina (left hamstring) and Carl Pavano (right forearm)
soon followed last month.


On Saturday, Jeff Karstens suffered a fractured right leg after
being hit by a line drive on the first pitch of the game.


Lefthander Kei Igawa came on to pitch six scoreless innings in
relief as the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox, 3-1, to snap a
seven-game losing streak.


After losing the series finale against Boston, the Yankees limped
into Texas.


The 20-year-old Hughes provided them with a much-needed lift and
a performance that appeared to be destined for the record books.


But after an 0-2 breaking pitch to Mark Teixeira in the seventh
inning, Hughes grabbed the back of his left leg.  Shortly after,
he was walking off the field with Monahan.
