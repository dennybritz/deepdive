Swiss chemicals company Ciba Specialty Chemicals said Thursday
its net profit more than doubled in the first quarter of 2007 to
77 million Swiss francs (64 million dollars, 48 million euros).


Sales rose 3.0 percent on an annual basis to 1.7 billion Swiss
francs, while earnings per share came in at 1.14 Swiss francs.


"The year has started off well, with good sales growth across the
business and improvements in profitability, particularly net
income," said chief executive officer Armin Meyer.


Ciba SC said it expected full year sales and net income to be
above 2006 levels, while the operating income margin was likely
to increase by 1.0 percent.


Business conditions in 2007 are expected to remain similar to
those of the previous year, with raw material costs remaining
stable at a high level, it added.
