Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell posted a 6.0-percent rise
in first- quarter profits, helped by better performances at its
refinery and chemical units, the group said on Thursday.


However group revenue fell, hit by lower output and weaker oil
prices, the world's second biggest energy group added in its
earnings statement.


Shell said net profit climbed to 7.281 billion dollars (5.351
billion euros) during the first three months of 2007 compared
with the first quarter of 2006.


Shell booked a one-time gain totalling 371 million dollars in the
first quarter of this year, largely from asset disposals.


"These are again competitive results," chief executive Jeroen van
der Veer said in comments accompanying the results statement.


Profit at its Oil Products unit increased to 1.488 billion
dollars.


"Earnings reflected higher refinery and marketing margins," Shell
said.


Meanwhile profit at its chemicals unit more than tripled to 480
million dollars.


Total group revenue fell 3.3 percent to 73.48 billion dollars.


Production fell 6.0 percent to 3.5 million barrels of oil
equivalent per day, partly owing to disruptions at Shell's
operations in Nigeria.


"Efforts continue towards restoring safe operational conditions
in the Niger Delta," Shell said.


The Niger Delta, a swathe of creeks and swamps and the size of
Scotland, is home to Nigeria's multi-billion dollar oil and gas
industry.


But the region has seen a resurgence in violent attacks on oil
firms and personnel over the past two years.
