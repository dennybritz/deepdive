The string from a child's kite was responsible for the crash of a
Philippine military helicopter that killed nine people, the head
of the country's air force said Thursday.


Although the full report on the crash on April 28 has not been
released Lieutenant General Horacio Tolentino said a kite string
appeared to be the likely cause.


He said that Muslim rebels had used kites to disable air force
helicopters in the past.


However terrorist involvement is not suspected in the latest
incident.


Tolentino said crash survivor Captain Allan Villagarcia told him
that the aircraft was flying perfectly and just about to land in
the central island of Cebu when a kite got entangled in the rotor
blades.


"There was no problem with the engine. It (the kite string)
caused the stoppage of the rotor," Tolentino said.


He said the nylon kite string was found still entangled, just
below the main rotor blade.


The Vietnam-era UH-1H "Huey" helicopter, carrying four people on
a training flight, went down on a crowded street, killing seven
people on the ground and two members of the crew.


Tolentino said the kites were being flown in an area where kite
flying is banned to avoid endangering aircraft. But, despite
this, the air force has no plans to charge anyone.


"We are not blaming anyone for what has happened. It is not the
intention of the people flying the kites to cause accidents," he
said.
