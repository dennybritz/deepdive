Korean Air said Thursday its first-quarter operating profit
jumped 66 percent from a year earlier thanks to increased
international demand and cost-cutting.


The airline said operating profit, a broad measure of earnings
before tax and other charges, for the three months to March stood
at 151.4 billion won (163 million dollars), up from 91.1 billion
won a year earlier.


But net profit rose only modestly, growing 2.7 percent to 130.8
billion won due to smaller gains on the company's currency
exchange operations.


"The strong growth in first-quarter operating income has opened a
good year for Korean Air in 2007," said president Lee Jong-Hee.


"The growth was the result of calculated expansion, yield
improvement, stringent cost controls and effective risk
management," he said.


Yield is the key industry measurement of returns.


Revenue in the quarter grew 10.7 percent to 2.03 trillion won
(2.2 billion dollars). On the back of brisk demand and yield
improvement, revenue from international passenger flights went up
19.3 percent to 1.09 trillion won.


Domestic passenger revenue declined 4.3 percent to 133.9 billion
won.


Revenue from cargo operations edged up 0.6 percent to 569.4
billion won, boosted by demand from Southeast Asia, China and
Japan.


The airline said outbound cargo shipments from Korea slowed due
to production line relocations by local exporters and as they
opted for cheaper ocean shipping.


The average fuel price eased slightly in the quarter though it
still remains historically high, it said.
