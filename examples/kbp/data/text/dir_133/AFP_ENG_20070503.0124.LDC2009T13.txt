South Korea's capital Seoul Thursday kicked off an unusual stunt
to publicise the city -- what is claimed to be the world's
longest tightrope race across its broad Han River.


Eighteen daredevils have been invited to take part in what is
said to be the first world high wire championships, lasting three
days.


Five took part on the first day, racing for one kilometre (0.6
miles) across the river on a wire suspended 21 metres (70 feet)
above the surface.


The organisers, the Seoul city government, are offering the
winner a cash prize of 15,000 dollars, with the runner-up and
third placed getting 10,000 and 5,000 dollars.


Safety nets covered only the riverbank and not the water, which
was patrolled by police boats. Crowds gathered to watch the show,
part of the city's festival dubbed "Hi Seoul".


Among those scheduled to take part are China's Adili Wuxiuer, the
current world record holder after walking a rope stretching 662
metres across the Chongqing Cliff in 2003, at a height of 687
metres.


On Thursday South Korea's Kwon Won-Tae finished the race in 17
minutes and two seconds while Russia's Alexey Marchenko fell in
right before the finishing line.


The contest ends Saturday.
