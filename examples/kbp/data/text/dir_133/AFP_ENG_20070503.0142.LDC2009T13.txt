Zimbabwean mobile phone giant Econet Wireless said on Thursday it
awarded a 15-million US dollar contract to Ericsson and ZTE
Corporation of China for the supply of equipment to extend its
network.


Econet says the expansion drive will see the number of its
subscribers increase from 800,000 to 1.2 million by the end of
this year.


"We have secured all the foreign currency for this round of
expansion through loans and equity structures," Econet Wireless
chief executive officer Douglas Mboweni said in a statement.


"We are not stopping at 1.2 million customers, we will not stop
until we have fulfilled our mandate to provide every Zimbabwean
who wants a phone with a phone."


Under the deal, the Swedish firm will supply equipment for
switches, intelligent network platforms, pre-paid systems as well
as new base stations in Harare and the Mashonaland and Manicaland
provinces.


ZTE has been contracted to install base stations in a project
that will see Econet extending coverage to Matabeleland
provinces, Masvingo and the Midlands.


The new expansion project succeeds a 20 million US dollar project
launched by Econet in October last year which increased its
network capacity from 500,000 to 800,000.


Zimbabwe has three mobile service providers. Fixed line services
by the state- run operator are often erratic.
