Tycoon Ananda Krishnan and associates said Thursday they will
offer a hefty premium to buy out other shareholders of top mobile
telecom firm Maxis in a deal which values the company at 39.5
billion ringgit (11.54 billion dollars).


Binariang GSM, an investment holding firm and special purpose
vehicle for Ananda's Usaha Tegas and affiliates, said through
CIMB Investment it would offer 15.60 ringgit (4.56 dollars) for
the outstanding shares in Maxis.


It said there are a total of 2.53 billion shares in the company
on issue.


"The consideration for the offer, to be satistifed in cash, is
15.60 ringgit," CIMB said in a notice.


CIMB said Binariang on Wednesday had obtained "irrevocable
undertakings" from 15 firms who own a total 59.53 percent of
Maxis to accept the offer.


Usaha Tegas and affiliates account for 46 percent of that total,
with the remaining 13 percent owned by other private firms, CIMB
officials said.


Binariang would also buy shares owned by employees in Maxis,
Malaysia's largest mobile operator, but CIMB did not give any
figures.


Maxis shares last traded at 13.00 ringgit before they were
suspended on the Malaysian bourse after reports about Ananda's
plan to take full control of the company broke.
