A group of 12 workers, including three South Koreans and eight
Filipinos, were kidnapped Thursday by armed militants in Nigeria,
the South Korean foreign ministry said.


"Three Koreans from Daewoo Engineering and Construction, eight
Philippine workers and a local driver have been kidnapped by a
group of armed insurgents," a ministry spokesman said.


The workers were taken hostage at a power plant construction site
near Port Harcourt in the Niger Delta area, he said.


"A gunfight erupted between the insurgents and security guards
but there have been no reports of injuries involving South Korean
workers as yet," he said.


An emergency control centre, consisting of Daewoo officials and
South Korean diplomats in Nigeria, has been established to work
for an early release of the hostages, the spokesman said.


"An emergency meeting will be held soon at the president's office
(in Seoul)," he said.


No group came forward immediately to claim the kidnapping.


Rich in oil reserves, the Niger Delta area has been at the centre
of a long confrontation between the Nigerian government and a
militant group.


Kidnappings of foreign workers in the area have been frequent in
recent years. Nine Daewoo workers were taken hostage in January
but were later released unharmed.
