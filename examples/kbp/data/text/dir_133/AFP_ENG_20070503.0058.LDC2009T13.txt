An international conference aimed at launching a five-year plan
to stabilise Iraq opened Thursday in the Egyptian resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh.


The gathering got under way with remarks from Egyptian Foreign
Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit, to be followed by speeches from Iraqi
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-
moon.


Foreign ministers and top diplomats from more than 50 countries
are attending the two-day conference, seen as the biggest
diplomatic push to solve Iraq's woes since the 2003 US-led
invasion.


On Thursday, participants were expected to adopt the
International Compact with Iraq (ICI), a five-year plan to
stabilise the war-torn country and develop its moribund economy.
