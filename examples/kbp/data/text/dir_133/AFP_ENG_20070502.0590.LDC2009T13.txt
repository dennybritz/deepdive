A bowler hat worn by comedian Stan Laurel, half of the 1930s
slapstick double act Laurel and Hardy, is to be auctioned in New
York later this month, Christie's auction house said Wednesday.


The iconic black bowler, so often used as a pantomime prop by the
comedy duo, was expected to fetch up to 15,000 dollars in the
sale, which also features three of the funnyman's bow ties and a
binder full of gags.


It was not known for sure if the hat was worn by Laurel on
screen, but the black felt bowler was identical to one he was
photographed wearing on the set of the 1938 film "Swiss Miss,"
Christie's said.


The lots are due to go on sale on May 30.
