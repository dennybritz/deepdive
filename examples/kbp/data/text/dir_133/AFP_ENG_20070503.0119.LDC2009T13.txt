Alexander Munoz of Venezuela regained the World Boxing
Association (WBA) super flyweight title Thursday when he defeated
holder Nobuo Nashiro by a unanimous points decision.


It was a repeat performance for the 28-year-old Munoz, who became
the champion in March 2002 by beating another Japanese Celes
Kobayashi with a technical knockout victory.


Munoz's overall record now stands at 30 wins, including 27 KOs,
against two defeats.


It was Nashiro's first taste of defeat after winning his previous
nine bouts with five KOs.


Nashiro, 25, tied the Japanese record to become the fastest-ever
champion in only his eighth bout beating Martin Castillo of
Mexico in July last year. He defended the title once beating
Eduardo Garcia of Mexico in December.
