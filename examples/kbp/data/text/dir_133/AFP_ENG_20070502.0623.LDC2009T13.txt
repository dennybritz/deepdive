Tens of thousands of British voters who are casting their ballot
for Thursday's elections through postal votes will be
disenfranchised, The Times reported, because of anti-fraud
measures that have wreaked havoc.


According to the daily, about five percent of all postal votes
are being discarded because of irregularities to do with
signatures or other personal identifiers on postal ballots.


In most of those cases, it is because people have failed to enter
their personal data correctly, rather than an attempt at fraud,
but new measures and computer software introduced to combat
potential fraud have led to major delays in printing and checking
ballots, the newspaper said.


Voters across Britain are going to the polls to elect various
local councils in England, as well as regional assemblies in
Scotland and Wales.


Local councils contacted by The Times reported an error rate of
between four and five percent, which the paper said could lead to
as many as 150,000 votes being discarded.


The paper also reported that several voters overseas will not be
able to cast their ballot because postal votes had only been sent
out this week.
