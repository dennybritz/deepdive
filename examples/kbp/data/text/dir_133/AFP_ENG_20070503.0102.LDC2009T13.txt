Two workers were killed and two others suffered burns after a
fire broke out Thursday at ExxonMobil's refinery in Singapore,
the US oil giant said.


"The fire has since been put out. We regret that two people have
died and two others injured as a result of the fire," the company
said in a statement.


The fire broke out at 1:15 am (1715 GMT) and was put out by the
Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the company and police
said.


Police said the dead were Singaporeans, while the two injured
workers, one from India and the other from Bangladesh, were
receiving treatment for their injuries at Singapore General
Hospital.


ExxonMobil said the company was cooperating with the SCDF to
investigate the incident.


An ExxonMobil spokesman said production at the oil refinery,
which has a daily crude refining capacity of 605,000 barrels, was
not disrupted and the section of the plant affected by the fire
had been shut down.


"We continue to supply our customers," he told AFP.


The ExxonMobil refinery is on Jurong Island, a man-made island
built by Singapore to house the country's thriving oil and
chemicals industry.


Jurong Island houses major oil companies such as ExxonMobil,
Shell and ChevronTexaco, as well as petrochemical giants BASF,
Celanese, DuPont, Mitsui Chemicals and Sumitomo Chemical.
