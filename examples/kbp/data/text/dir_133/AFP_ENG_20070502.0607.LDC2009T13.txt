Unions and management of Belgian oil enterprises reached
agreement late Wednesday on wages, lifting the threat of strike
action, Belga news agency reported.


The Belgian oil sector had earlier begun reducing production on
Wednesday after wage negotiations between unions and big
international oil groups such as ExxonMobil and Total active in
Antwerp failed to lead to an agreement, BRAFCO industry
association official Olivier Neirynck told AFP.


Christian trade union CSC had warned of a strike if an agreement
was not found by May 9 while Socialist union FGTB hads threatened
to down tools from May 20 if a deal was not struck.


Belgium's refiners are mostly based near the northern port city
of Antwerp and pump 700,000 barrels of product per day.
