New Zealand's largest listed company Telecom Corporation said
Thursday it would return 1.1 billion dollars (812 million US) to
investors through a share cancellation.


The capital return was announced as New Zealand's dominant
telecommunications carrier announced a net profit of 238 million
dollars for the third quarter to March.


This was up from 222 million dollars a year earlier and slightly
better than the flat result expected by analysts.


But analysts said after stripping out one-off factors, the profit
was slightly lower than expected and that results for mobile
communications were disappointing.


The capital return to shareholders, which is expected to be
completed by September, follows the 2.24 billion dollar sale of
Telecom's Yellow Pages business to a private equity consortium
announced in March.


Chairman Wayne Boyd said the company's search for a new chief
executive -- after Theresa Gattung's February announcement that
she intended to resign -- was on track. An appointment is
expected to be announced at the end of June.


In the nine months to March net profit came to 690 million
dollars against a loss of 244 million dollars a year earlier.
Last year's result included a 897 million dollar writedown in the
value of Telecom's Australian AAPT unit.


Shares in Telecom fell five cents to 4.82 dollars on the New
Zealand Stock Exchange after the profit announcement.


Forsyth Barr broker David Price said the result was slightly
below his firm's forecast.
