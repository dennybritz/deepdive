Hong Kong share prices opened sharply higher Thursday, gaining
0.99 percent led by HSBC, China Mobile and other blue chips after
Wall Street pushed further into record territory overnight,
dealers said.


They said the gains may be trimmed in late trade due to profit-
taking.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index opened up 193.92 points at
20,582.41.
