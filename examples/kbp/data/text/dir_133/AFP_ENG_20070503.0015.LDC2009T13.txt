Hong Kong share prices finished the Thursday morning session 1.12
percent higher as HSBC and property stocks attracted follow-
through interest after another record finish on Wall street
overnight, dealers said.


They said HSBC was supported by comments that it aims to list in
Shanghai in 5-10 years and news of a significant investment in
the bank by a private-equity firm owned by Dubai ruler Sheikh
Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.


The property sector was boosted ahead of a government land
auction next week and expectations of strong apartment sales in
the weeks ahead.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 228.03 points at
20,616.52, off a low of 20,555.57 and a high of 20,619.34.
