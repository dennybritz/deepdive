Six teams will play for the Pacific Nations Cup in May, with
Australia A added to the mix for the first time, the
International Rugby Board (IRB) said Thursday.


The tournament replaces last year's Pacific 5 Nations event and
is designed to boost the development of second-tier rugby nations
in the lead-up to this year's World Cup in France.


Alongside Australia A will be Fiji, Japan, Samoa, Tonga and the
Junior All Blacks.


IRB Head of Rugby Services Mark Egan said the line-up would
guarantee "an unprecedented number of top-level matches for Fiji,
Japan, Samoa and Tonga as they step up their preparations for
Rugby World Cup."


The tournament kicks off on May 19 when Samoa entertain Fiji in
Apia.


Australia A make their debut against Tonga on May 25, while the
following day the Junior All Blacks begin their title defence
against Samoa and Japan travel to Suva to take on Fiji.
