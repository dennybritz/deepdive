Prime Minister John Howard expressed concern Thursday about
infrastructure inadequacies at Australia's ports which this week
forced a coal mining firm to sack 250 workers.


Coal and Allied Industries, a subsidiary of global resources
giant Rio Tinto, said Wednesday that it would lay off workers
later this month because bottlenecks at the port of Newcastle had
forced it to slash production.


More than 70 coal ships are queued up at the New South Wales port
waiting to load coal from mines in the Hunter Valley region amid
booming global demand for Australia's resources.


There have been longstanding complaints that as the outdated
docks cannot cope with the volume.


Howard said he would speak with the New South Wales government
about ways to boost the the capacity of the port, which comes
under the jurisdiction of the state government.


He also said the federal government may move to takeover the
management of ports from individual states if the problem
persisted.


"We have this wonderful circumstance where people want our coal
in abundance and we're very keen to sell it and if things are
being held up and there's further things that governments
together can do, we should do them," he said.


"If governments together can't do them, then you may have to
shift responsibility from one government to another."


The federal government has previously complained that the
blockages at the nation's ports delays hit the balance of
payments by robbing the country of export income.
