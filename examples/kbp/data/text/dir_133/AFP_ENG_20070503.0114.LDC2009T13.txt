British American Tobacco posted a near 10.0 percent rise in
first-quarter profit thanks to cost savings and an "excellent"
performance by its operations in emerging markets, the group said
on Thursday.


The data lifted BAT's share price to a record high in early
London trade, dealers said.


BAT, the maker of Dunhill, Kent and Lucky Strike cigarettes, said
net profit climbed to 495 million pounds (725 million euros, 986
million dollars) in the first three months of 2007 compared with
the same period a year earlier.


Group revenue dropped 3.0 percent to 2.232 billion pounds, but
cost savings meant BAT posted a profits rise.


"The first quarter has been somewhat flattered by excellent
performances in Brazil and South Africa," BAT chairman Jan du
Plessis said in comments accompanying the earnings release.
