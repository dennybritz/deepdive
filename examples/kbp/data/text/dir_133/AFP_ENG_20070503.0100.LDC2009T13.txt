Unidentified assailants Thursday kidnapped several employees of
Italian energy group ENI who were working on a ship in volatile
southern Nigeria, the company said in a statement.


It said there were 85 people on the ship anchored 90 kilometers
(55 miles) from Port Harcourt, including 22 foreigners from
several countries, when the attack occurred.


The Italian foreign ministry told the Ansa news agency there were
no Italians among those held.
