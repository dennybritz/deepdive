A group of 12 workers, including three South Koreans and eight
Filipinos, were kidnapped Thursday by armed militants in Nigeria,
the South Korean foreign ministry said.


"Three Koreans from Daewoo Engineering and Construction, eight
Philippine workers and a local driver have been kidnapped by a
group of armed insurgents," a ministry spokesman said.


The workers were taken hostage at a power plant construction site
near Port Harcourt in the Niger Delta area, he said.
