Yahoo on Thursday launched a web-based version of its free
instant messaging service for Internet users who want to stay
connected while away from their home computers.


Yahoo Messenger for the Web lets people use the online search
titan's service from any Internet-linked computer without needing
to download or install software, as was the case previously.


The service is tailored for use by travelers, workers whose
employers block software downloads to company machines, cyber-
cafe dwellers and people who simply cannot afford their own
computers.


"This really has great implications for the road warriors out
there who are on the go," Yahoo senior vice president of
communications Brad Garlinghouse told AFP.


"People have become quite accustomed to a non-stop accessible
life."


Industry statistics indicate that nearly a quarter of US Internet
users go online from places other than home or work.


The new service is introduced as Yahoo vies with rivals Google
and Microsoft for the devotion of Internet users whose visits can
be parlayed into online advertising revenue.


Users of Yahoo's instant messaging system can engage in exchanges
with people using Microsoft's Windows Live Messenger.


Yahoo Messenger for the Web is available online at
http://webmessenger.yahoo.com, according to the Sunnyvale,
California-based Internet firm.


The service is initially launching in Brazil, India, Malaysia,
Philippines, Vietnam and the United States. It is to be made
available in other countries through the rest of the year.
