Russian mining group Norilsk Nickel on Thursday announced a
takeover bid for Canadian nickel producer LionOre, offering 16.2
percent more than a March bid by Anglo-Swiss group Xstrata.


Norilsk's cash bid of 21.5 dollars per share values the company
at 5.3 billion dollars (3.8 billion euros), the company said in a
statement.


Xstrata, which bid four billion dollars (2.9 billion euros), says
it has secured the agreement of a number of LionOre's
shareholders.


An international gold and nickel producer, LionOre has operations
in Australia, Botswana and South Africa.
