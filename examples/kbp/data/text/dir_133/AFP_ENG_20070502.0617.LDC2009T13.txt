Actress Sandra Bullock has sought a restraining order for a
stalker who allegedly tried to run over her husband last month,
court documents published by a celebrity website showed
Wednesday.


Bullock filed papers in Orange County Superior Court, southern
California, requesting that 45-year-old Marcia Valentine not be
allowed to come within 500 meters (yards) of her or husband,
Jesse James, TMZ.com reported.


Valentine is alleged to have attempted to run over James in her
car several times during an altercation at Bullock's home on
April 22.


The attack took place as Bullock and James' 10-year-old son Jesse
Jr looked on. Police say they are treating the incident as
assault with a deadly weapon.


Valentine was arrested on April 23 and was released after posting
bail of 25,000 dollars. She is due to re-appear in court on May
22.


Bullock, the star of "Speed," "Miss Congeniality" and last year's
best picture Oscar-winner "Crash" has suffered problems with
stalkers in the past.


In 2006 she won a three-year restraining order against a man she
accused of stalking her across three US states.
