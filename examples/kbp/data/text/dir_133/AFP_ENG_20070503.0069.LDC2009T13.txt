Four Filipinos working for the US government were killed by a
rocket attack on Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, the
embassy reported Thursday.


"These four colleagues, citizens of the Philippines, were
integral members of our embassy community," said US charge
d'affaires Daniel Speckhard.


"We value their contributions to our efforts on behalf of the
people of Iraq, and we mourn their passing," he added, in a
statement.


The rocket attack took place Wednesday after several days of
mortar attacks against the Green Zone, the seat of the Iraqi
government as well as the US and British embassies.


The Filipinos died on the same day that a US military spokesman
warned that insurgent gunners were trying "to score a spectacular
hit or obtain a headline grabbing direct hit" on a Green Zone
target.


Both Sunni and Shiite armed groups periodically launch attacks
against the area, although US Rear Admiral Mark Fox denied that
the latest attacks were part of a concerted effort by anti-
American forces.


"It's more than potshots, but not a campaign," he said.
