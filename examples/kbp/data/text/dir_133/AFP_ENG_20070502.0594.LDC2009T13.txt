US President George W. Bush will welcome Haitian President Rene
Preval for talks May 9 on stabilizing Haiti and building
democracy and economic development there, the White House said
Wednesday.


"Under President Preval's leadership, Haiti has made important
progress in strengthening democratic institutions and laying the
groundwork for economic stability," spokesman Tony Snow said in a
statement.


"The two leaders will discuss a range of issues, including recent
efforts by the United Nations stabilization mission in Haiti to
enhance security and opportunities for promoting growth and
prosperity in Haiti," he said.


The United States remains Haiti's largest trading partner and
largest donor of humanitarian assistance, Snow said in the
statement.
