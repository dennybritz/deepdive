Barry Bonds belted his 743th career homer and later drove in the
go-ahead run with a two-run single in the eighth to lead the San
Francisco Giants to a 5-3 win over the Colorado Rockies
Wednesday.


Moving within 12 home runs of Hank Aaron's all-time mark of 755,
Bonds continued another climb in the record books by driving in
four runs to tie Stan Musial for fourth place on the career RBI
list with 1,951.


The 42-year-old slugger hit a laser off lefthander Jeff Francis
(1-4) into the seats in right field for a 2-0 lead in the fourth
inning. It was his ninth blast of the season.


While he moved closer to making history with the home run, the
single was more critical to San Francisco, who had lost four of
five and had just fallen behind, 3-2, in the top of the eighth
inning.
