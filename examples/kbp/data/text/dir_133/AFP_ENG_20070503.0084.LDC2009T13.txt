An Australian man who allegedly threatened to blow up a Jetstar
plane because he was angry about an excess baggage charge was
refused bail when he appeared in court Thursday.


The court was told Denis Malizani stormed out of the Jetstar
terminal in Brisbane on April 26 after being told he would have
to pay the excess baggage fee, Australian Associated Press
reported.


The 30-year-old then allegedly phoned Jetstar's call centre to
complain and the prosecutor said he made threats when told
nothing could be done about the situation.


"I'll tell you what I'll do -- I'll blow up your fucking
aircraft. You've just created a terrorist," Malizani allegedly
told the call centre operator.


He entered no plea on a charge of threatening to destroy an
aircraft, which has a maximum penalty of two years' jail.


Malizani's defence lawyer said his client had been suffering
depression after recently losing his job.


Magistrate John Smith refused bail, saying Malizani was a risk to
public safety, and remanded him in custody until May 11.
