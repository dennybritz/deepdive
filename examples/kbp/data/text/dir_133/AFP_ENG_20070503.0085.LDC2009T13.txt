South and North Korea are to hold their first top-level military
talks in a year to discuss reducing tensions and cross-border
railway links, a minister said Thursday.


Unification Minister Lee Jae-Joung said generals from the two
sides would meet from Tuesday to Thursday next week at the truce
village of Panmunjom, inside the heavily fortified border zone.


"General-level talks will start on Tuesday," a ministry spokesman
quoted him as telling a seminar.


North korea had proposed the general-level talks in response to
Seoul's request for a lower-level military meeting.
