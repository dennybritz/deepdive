Unidentified assailants Thursday kidnapped several employees of
Italian energy group ENI who were working on an oil platform in
volatile southern Nigeria, the company said in a statement.


"This morning a group of armed Nigerian men assaulted the FPSO
(floating production storage and offloading) Mystras anchored 55
miles (90 kilometers) from shore off Port Harcourt," the
statement said.


"Present aboard were 85 workers of whom 22 were expatriates of
various nationalities," it said, adding: "The assailants then
left the platform with a few hostages."


The Italian foreign ministry told the ANSA news agency that no
Italians were among those held.
