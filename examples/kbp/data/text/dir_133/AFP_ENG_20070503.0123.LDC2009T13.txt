Special courts in Bangladesh will next week begin hearing
corruption cases against dozens of prominent figures detained as
part of the emergency government's anti-graft campaign, officials
said Thursday.


Judges of five courts set up to expedite the cases within the
national parliament complex began work Thursday and would hear
their first cases within days, Law and Justice Ministry Secretary
Ali Ashraf Khan Lodi said.


"We have set up five special courts for handling graft cases. We
also received sanction to set up 13 more courts across the
country," Lodi said.


The courts would aim to complete each case within 60 days, added
another official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity.


The first defendants were likely to include three former
ministers, the official added.


At least 50 high-profile figures and hundreds of district-level
officials with links to both the main parties -- the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Awami League -- have been
arrested on corruption allegations since January.


The military-backed caretaker government took over on January 12,
a day after President Iajuddin Ahmed resigned as head of the
previous interim government, cancelled elections planned for
January 22 and imposed emergency rule following months of unrest.


The new government has pledged to clean up Bangladesh's
notoriously corrupt political system before holding rescheduled
elections by the end of 2008.
