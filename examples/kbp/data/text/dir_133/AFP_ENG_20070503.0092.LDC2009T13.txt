Online search engine Google said Thursday it has opened an office
Singapore to be closer to its customers and advertisers in
southeast Asia, which boasts a market of half a billion people.


"The online environment in southeast Asia is growing rapidly,
with significant developments in broadband Internet access and
e-commerce activities," Richard Kimber, Google's regional
managing director, said in a statement.


"We are pleased to have our newest operations in Singapore, where
we can draw from the highest quality talent to further help our
users find the information they're looking for, and at the same
time, help local and regional businesses succeed."


Google declined to say how much it has invested in the Singapore
office.


Singapore is one of southeast Asia's most technology-friendly
economies and one of the most wired countries in Asia.


The government is seeking to attract high-tech industries as it
moves away from the traditional manufacturing sector.
