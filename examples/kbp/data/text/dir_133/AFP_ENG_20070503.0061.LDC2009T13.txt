Four Filipinos working for the US government were killed by a
rocket attack on Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, the
embassy reported Thursday.


"These four colleagues, citizens of the Philippines, were
integral members of our embassy community," said US charge
d'affairs Daniel Speckhard.


"We value their contributions to our efforts on behalf of the
people of Iraq, and we mourn their passing," he added, in a
statement.


The rocket attack took place on Wednesday.
