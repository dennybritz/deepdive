Two workers are dead and another two sustained injuries after a
fire broke out Thursday at US oil giant ExxonMobil's oil refinery
in Singapore, the company said.


"The fire has since been put out. We regret that two people have
died and two others were injured as a result of the fire," the
company said in a statement.


The fire broke out at 1:15 am (1715 GMT) and was put out by the
Singapore Civil Defence Force, the company and police said.


An Exxon Mobil spokesman said the production at the refinery,
which has a daily crude refining capacity of 605,000 barrels, is
not affected.


"We continue to supply our customers," he told AFP.
