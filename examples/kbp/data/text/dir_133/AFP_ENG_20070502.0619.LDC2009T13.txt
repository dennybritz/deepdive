The Bank of England, Britain's central bank, is "clearly" failing
to convey to the financial markets how it will likely respond to
economic data, the bank's governor said in an interview published
Thursday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, Mervyn King said that he was
willing to consider demands from market economists for "something
to guide them how to interpret the future data as they come out,
as they want to know how we are likely to interpret that data."


"It will require quite a lot of hard work on our part in thinking
it through, but I think we should do it," King said.


He added that the bank was "clearly not doing enough of it now --
which is to give people this feel for how we are likely to react
to data."


The Bank of England does not publish explicit interest rate
targets, and does not use code words to signal to financial
markets that it is about to make a move in interest rates, and
King has rejected both possibilities.


It sets monetary policy through its nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee at monthly interest-rate setting meetings, and
publishes the minutes of those meetings two weeks after they
occur.
