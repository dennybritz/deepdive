The United Arab Emirates is considering relaxing its strict
abortion law to allow the termination of foetuses with certain
genetic disorders, the Gulf News daily reported on Thursday.


Dr Ali Shakar, undersecretary at the Ministry of Health, told the
paper the ministry in the Gulf Arab state was working with legal
and religious authorities to draft a law allowing "therapeutic
abortions" as part of a genetic disorder prevention programme.


Abortion is prohibited in the conservative Muslim state, unless
the mother's life is at risk.


The paper said the draft law could allow abortions to be
performed for the thalassaemia blood disorder, which affects one
in 12 Emiratis, and sickle cell anaemia. But it did not state at
what development stage the termination could be carried out.
