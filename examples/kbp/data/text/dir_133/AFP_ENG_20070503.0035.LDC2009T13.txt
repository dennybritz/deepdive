The South Korean government was Thursday ordered by a court to
give a passport to a senior North Korean defector who is a vocal
critic of the hardline communist state.


Kim Dok-Hong, a former senior official of the North's ruling
Workers Party, wants to visit the United States to speak about
human rights conditions in his former homeland.


Yonhap news agency said the Seoul government, which practises a
"sunshine" engagement policy with the North, apparently fears
Kim's overseas activities could damage relations with Pyongyang.


Foreign ministry officials were not immediately available for
comment.


Kim filed a suit against the foreign ministry in 2005 after he
was several times denied a passport. The government has cited
concerns about his safety.


But the Seoul High Court ordered the ministry to give him the
document.


Kim, 68, defected to the South in 1997 along with Hwang Jang-Yop,
84, the highest North Korean official ever to come to Seoul.


In August 2004, Kim received a death threat. A letter delivered
to him, along with a cleaver and bottles of poison, described him
and Hwang as "anti- unification traitors."


Hwang, who lives under guard in the South, was allowed to visit
the US in 2003 after Washington agreed to provide security. He
was secretary of the Workers' Party before his 1997 defection
with Kim while on a visit to Beijing.


Hwang is an architect of the North's ruling philosophy of "juche"
or self- reliance and once tutored leader Kim Jong-Il.
