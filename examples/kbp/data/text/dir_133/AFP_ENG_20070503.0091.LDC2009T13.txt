Russian President Vladimir Putin has awarded state honors to the
26-year-old son of spy chief Nikolai Patrushev for "long years of
conscientious work," Russian media reported Thursday.


Andrei Patrushev, an employee at state-controlled oil firm
Rosneft, was awarded a Medal of Honour officially recognizing
"achievements on the job and long years of conscientious work,"
the daily Kommersant wrote.


His father, Nikolai Patrushev, is a close Putin ally and head of
the successor to the KGB, the Federal Security Service (FSB),
which Putin himself headed before entering politics.


"Given that the young son of the FSB head came to Rosneft in
September 2006, he was more likely awarded for 'achievements on
the job' than 'long years of labour'," quipped Kommersant.


His uncle, 62-year-old Viktor Patrushev, received the Medal of
Friendship for participating in a helicopter expedition to the
South Pole in January.


Current and former secret service employees have filled many top
posts in government and business during Putin's two terms as
president.
