The United States on Wednesday denounced the jailing in
Uzbekistan of a human rights activist, Umida Niyazova, calling
the charges against her "politically motivated."


Niyazova, 32, was sentenced on Tuesday to seven years in jail for
illegally crossing the Uzbekistan border, smuggling and
distributing publications threatening public order.


Authorities alleged that the rights activist had threatened the
state by financing non-governmental organizations with foreign
money.


"The United States is disturbed by the conduct of the May 1 trial
and subsequent conviction of human rights activist Umida
Niyazova," State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said.


"We believe these charges to be politically-motivated," he said.


Casey said Niyazova's "hasty" two-day trial, which diplomatic
observers and journalists were barred from attending, was "a
continuation of the government of Uzbekistan's campaign of
repression against human rights activists and other members of
civil society."


"The United States calls again upon Uzbekistan to uphold its
commitments to internationally protected human rights," he said.
