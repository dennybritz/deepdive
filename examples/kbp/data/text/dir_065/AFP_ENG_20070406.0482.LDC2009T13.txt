Producers of the next "Indiana Jones" movie are waiting to hear
if former 007 star Sean Connery will return as the main hero's
father, the trade magazine Variety reported Friday.


Directors George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, set to begin work on
the fourth installment of the film franchise in June along with
star Harrison Ford, are trying to coax Connery, 76, out of
retirement for the film, Variety said.


Connery, who has been in no films since 2003, said he'd consider
returning if he liked the script, the magazine reported.


Ford, 64, returns as the daring archaeologist. The movie co-stars
Shia LaBeouf, 20, and Cate Blanchett, 37, likely as Indy's son
and love interest respectively.


Producers have kept the plot and even title of "Indiana Jones 4"
a tight secret, but Paramount Pictures plans to release the film
in May 2008, Variety said.
