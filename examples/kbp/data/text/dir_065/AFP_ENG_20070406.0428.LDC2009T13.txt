The state-run News Agency of Nigeria has dismissed about 200
people as part of a government decision to cut the workforce in
the public sector, agency officials said Friday.


Some of the criteria used in the sack Thursday were poor health,
a poor work record, low productivity, old age or lack of
discipline.


Most of those affected in the lay-offs, believed to be followed
by others, were junior workers in the administrative, security
and clerical cadres.


The agency, whose headquarters is in Abuja, celebrated its 30th
anniversary last year.


The government announced last month that it was preparing NAN
which has a workforce of about 1,000 for a partial privatisation
which would enable it to generate revenue for part of its
operations.


It is presently fully funded by the federal government.
