Prominent Iraq war opponent Cindy Sheehan urged US President
George W. Bush on Friday to "end this madness" and accused his
Democratic foes of having "betrayed" their anti-war supporters.


Sheehan, whose soldier son Casey was killed in Iraq, planned to
lead dozens of protesters to a security checkpoint near Bush's
Texas ranch and read out names of US dead in Iraq using a
bullhorn.


"Our message is: Today is Good Friday, when Jesus Christ was
killed by the Roman Empire. He rose again on Sunday, came back to
life. But our loved ones won't be coming home" from Iraq, she
told reporters.


The protesters will tell Bush "to end this madness for our
families," said Sheehan, who took a tough line against Democrats
who harnessed anger at the Iraq war to recapture the US Congress
in November.


"They got there and they betrayed the grass roots that put them
back there," she said. "We can't depend on the Democrats."


The Democrats are locked in a bitter struggle with Bush over an
emergency war funding bill that would set a timetable calling for
a withdrawal of US forces from the strife-torn country in 2008.


"The timeline is now, not 18 months, not two years," said
Sheehan.


The anti-war movement "lost a little momentum during the
elections, but it's picking up again" because "the Democrats
aren't really doing anything" to end the conflict, she said.
