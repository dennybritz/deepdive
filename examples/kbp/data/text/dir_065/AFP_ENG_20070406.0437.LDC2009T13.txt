A federal judge Friday ordered that former CIA operative Luis
Posada Carriles, wanted by Cuba and Venezuela for the deadly
downing of a Cuban jet, be released pending a hearing on
immigration fraud charges.


The ruling, made by a federal judge in Texas, does not
necessarily mean Posada Carriles, 79, will leave jail immediately
as migration officials have a deportation order for him and they
could order him arrested.
