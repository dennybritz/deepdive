Carmelo Anthony scored 23 points as the Nuggets posted a 75-71
National Basketball Association victory over Dallas on Friday,
thwarting the Mavericks' bid for 70 wins this season.


Allen Iverson had 22 points and Nene added 16 and 10 rebounds for
the Nuggets, who improved to 39-36 and remained one-half game
behind the Los Angeles Lakers for sixth place in the Western
Conference playoff race.


The Lakers beat the Seattle Supersonics 112-109 on Friday.


The Mavericks improved to 62-13, but saw All-Star forward Josh
Howard leave in the first quarter with an ankle sprain.


They also failed in their attempt to match the 1995-96 Chicago
Bulls as the only teams in NBA history to reach the 70-win mark.


After Dallas All-Star Dirk Nowitzki made two free throws with
1:51 left to tie the game at 71-71, Anthony converted an ally-oop
pass from Marcus Camby to give Denver a two-point lead with 1:17
remaining.


On the Mavericks' next possesion, Anthony made a steal with 33
seconds left, and after Camby missed a jumper from the left
corner and Nene rebounded the miss, the forward made two free
throws to give the Nuggets a 75-71 edge with 9.2 second to play.


Dallas's Jerry Stackhouse missed a 3-pointer with five seconds
left, sealing Denver's fourth straight victory.


Nowitzki finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds for the
Mavericks, who failed to score at least 90 points for the first
time in 22 games.
