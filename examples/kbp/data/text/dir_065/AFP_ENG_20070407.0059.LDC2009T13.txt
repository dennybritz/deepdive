A strong earthquake hit an area near Portugal's Azores Islands
early Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties
or damage, the US government reported.


The quake, which was registered at 0709 GMT, measured 6.0 on the
open-ended Moment Magnitude scale, which measures the area of the
fault that ruptured and the total energy released.


The epicenter was located in the Atlantic Ocean, 104 kilometers
(64 miles) east of the town of Ponta Delgada, according to the US
Geological Survey.
