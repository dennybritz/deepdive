Two French aid workers who went missing this week have been
kidnapped by Taliban militants in southwest Afghanistan and taken
to volatile Helmand province, a provincial governor said
Saturday.


"According to intelligence service reports, they were kidnapped
on the highway in Khash Rod district (in Nimroz province) and
taken to neighbouring Helmand," Nimroz governor Ghulam Dastgir
Azad said by telephone.


He is the first official to confirm that the French nationals,
who went missing on Tuesday, were kidnapped.


The two aid workers from the organisation Terre d'Enfance (A
World for Our Children) were travelling with three Afghan
colleagues from Nimroz westwards to neighbouring Farah province
when they went missing.


The Taliban militia, who have mounted a bloody insurgency since
they were ousted by US-led forces in 2001, claimed late Wednesday
to have captured the five.
