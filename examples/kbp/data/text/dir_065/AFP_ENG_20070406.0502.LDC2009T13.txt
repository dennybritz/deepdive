Disney fun parks announced Friday that they would start offering
"commitment ceremonies" for gay and lesbian couples, changing a
policy that only allowed heterosexuals to book one of their Fairy
Tale Weddings.


"We are updating our Fairy Tale Wedding guidelines to include
commitment ceremonies and continue our policy of creating a
welcoming, respectful and inclusive environment for all of our
guests," spokesman Donn Walker told AFP.


"That change to our policy started this week," said Walker of
Disneyland in California.


The Disney weddings website promises a "fairy godplanner grants
your every wish and ensures your wedding day is everything you
have always dreamt it would be."
