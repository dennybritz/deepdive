MUMBAI, April 7, 2007 (AFP) ) - India's outgoing cricket coach
Greg Chappell underwent medical tests on Saturday to determine if
he was well enough to fly out of the country, officials said.


Chappell, who quit as coach after the team's disastrous first
round exit in the World Cup, had postponed his flight after
feeling unwell, the Press Trust of India reported.


Chappell waved to a horde of journalists outside Bombay Hospital
in the western city of Mumbai on Saturday as he left the building
following the tests.


Doctors would examine the results "and then decide whether
Chappell is fit enough to fly out of the city," hospital
spokesman Ashish Kumar Tiwari said, quoted by PTI.


"He was brought to the hospital and has been receiving a checkup
at the hospital .... There is presently no cause for concern,"
Tiwari said.


The Australian underwent renal, liver, lipid and blood checks,
Tiwari said.


"I came for a routine check-up and am fine," Chappell said in a
statement.


There were no further details.


Chappell and his wife, Judy, had been planning to fly to
Singapore later on Saturday for a short break before heading home
to Australia.


Chappell had postponed the journey by a day after he felt unwell,
PTI said.
