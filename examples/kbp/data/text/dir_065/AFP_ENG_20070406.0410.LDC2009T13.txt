Iran described as "propaganda" Friday a homecoming news
conference given by British naval personnel in which they spoke
of "psychological" intimidation during their detention in Iran.


"The propoganda and the staged show can not cover up the British
military's violation of the Islamic Republic of Iran sea border
and their repeated illegal entry," foreign ministry spokesman
Mohammad Ali Hosseini said.


The 15 British naval personnel held by Iran told Friday how they
were stripped, blindfolded and handcuffed as part of
"psychological" intimidation during their detention.


A day after their return to Britain, the group said they feared
for their lives if they resisted and were threatened with seven
years in jail if they did not confess to being in Iranian waters.
