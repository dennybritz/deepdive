One teenager was killed and another seriously injured in a yet
another knife attack on youngsters in London, police said
Saturday.


Police were called to a street in Leytonstone, northeast London,
shortly before 8:00 pm (1900 GMT) Friday to reports of two
youngsters with serious stab injuries.


A 14-year-old died later and a 15-year-old was in a critical
condition in hospital, police said.


The attack follows the killing of five young males in the city in
the past two months, of whom three were shot dead and two were
stabbed to death.


The teenager killing spree has shocked the country and left
commentators worried about an apparent rise in deadly violence
and gang culture among Britain's male youths.


Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Horne called the latest fatal
stabbing an "appalling crime."


"We understand a large group of youths were involved in an
incident... during which we believe the two victims were stabbed.


"A number of youths were seen running from the scene," he said.


Police said both the victims were black and lived in the area.


The latest teenager killing came on the same day that a pregnant
22-year-old woman was shot dead in her south London home over
what police believe could have been parking dispute.
