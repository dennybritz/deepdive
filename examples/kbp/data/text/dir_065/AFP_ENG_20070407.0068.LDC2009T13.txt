The Pakistan cricket team's media manager said some players'
fixation on religious activities resulted in their dismal
performance in the World Cup, reports said Saturday.


P.J. Mir made the observation to reporters after submitting his
statement to the evaluation committee of Pakistan Cricket Board
(PCB) in Lahore, who are reviewing the team's performance in the
Caribbean.


"I could not disclose the fact before, but today I informed the
media that most of the members had no focus on cricket. Their
fixation was on preaching, affecting the team's preparation," the
English daily Dawn quoted him as telling reporters after the
Friday hearing.


Mir said some members of team had "no drive for the game and were
much more active in preaching and praying."


"I have video footage which will prove me right and I will
handover those tapes to the Pakistan Cricket Board," he said.


"It was beyond the limit, this religious influence, and the
players were even made to offer prayers during the flights," he
said without naming who had forced the team members to pray.


The newspaper said Mir's bold statement was seen as an attempt to
check the growing religious extremism within cricket in Pakistan
amid reports that the PCB had devised a plan to rid the team of
extremism.


The world number three side were dumped out of the World Cup by
minnows Ireland on March 18. A day later their coach Bob
Woolmer's strangled body was found in his room on the 12th floor
of the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in Kingston.
