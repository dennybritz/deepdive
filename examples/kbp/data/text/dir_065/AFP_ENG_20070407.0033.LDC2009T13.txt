Kobe Bryant poured in 46 points and Lamar Odom added 20 with
seven assists on Friday as the Los Angeles Lakers held on for a
112-109 National Basketball Association victory over Seattle.


Sixth in the Western Conference but just one-half game in front
of Denver, the Lakers have lost four of their last six games.


They also are just two games in front of the Los Angeles Clippers
for the eighth spot.


But on Friday, the Lakers looked ready for the postseason thanks
to Bryant, who notched his 16th 40-plus game of the season.


The superstar guard shot 13-of-27 from the field and 19-of-24
from the free- throw line.


However, the Lakers are most effective with Odom as the playmaker
and a dangerous secondary scorer.


The versatile forward was 9-of-11 from the field and distributed
the ball well - committing just two turnovers.


With the game tied at 103-103, Bryant nailed a tough fadeaway to
give Los Angeles the lead for good with 1:55 left.


Chris Wilcox scored a season-high 32 points for the SuperSonics,
who have lost four straight.
