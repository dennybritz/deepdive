Chad bombed rebel positions in the east of the country this week
in an operation to force out fighters from Sudan, officials said
Friday.


A military operation occurred in an area near the Sudanese border
on Wednesday, with rebels "like the Janjaweed" targeted,
government spokesman Hourmadji Moussa said.


The group known as the Janjaweed, a Sudanese government proxy
militia, has been accused of carrying out mass killings in the
Darfur region of Sudan.


A Chadian rebel group said in a statement that a military
helicopter bombed the area around the village of Dodgore, about
30 kilometres (20 miles) from the Sudan border, on Wednesday. The
statement said civilians were killed and hurt, but did not give
further details.


It was the first fighting between the Chad military and eastern
rebels since February.


Last weekend, clashes between local groups in the east resulted
in more than 100 deaths, provoking intervention from Chad's army.


Chad's government blamed the Janjaweed for involvement in those
attacks, but that could not be confirmed.


Chad and Sudan blame each other for supporting rebels in their
respective countries. Both have refused the deployment of a
United Nations force to patrol their border.
