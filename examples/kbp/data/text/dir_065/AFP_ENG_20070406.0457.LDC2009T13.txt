France's Tatiana Golovin beat Venus Williams 6-2, 6-3 in the
quarter-finals of the WTA Amelia Island event, marking the
second-straight time Golovin has beaten Williams on clay.


Williams, a five-time Grand Slam champion, also lost to Golovin
in their only previous contest at the WTA Charleston tournament
in 2005.


Golovin advances to the semi-finals of the 600,000 dollar
tournament where she will face Ana Ivanovic who upset second seed
and Serbian compatriot Jelena Jankovic 7-5, 6-3 on Friday.


Eighth seed Golovin needed one hour, 15 minutes to dispatch the
former World No. 1 Williams, who was playing in just her third
tournament of 2007.


Williams is now 10-2 overall having won the Memphis title earlier
this year.


Williams is seeking to re-establish herself as a dominant player
on the women's tour in the wake of a left wrist injury that
sidelined her for much of last season.
