Juventus saw their lead at the top of Italy's second division cut
to four points on Friday after they were held to a 1-1 draw at
home to mid-table Albinoleffe.


Francesco Ruopolo's right-footed strike put the visitors ahead in
the 32nd minute before Federico Balzaretti levelled the score
with a lobbed shot five minutes later.


Juve came close to snatching victory in the last five minutes
when Bulgarian international Valeri Bojinov saw his angled header
clip the post.


Albinoleffe have been stubborn opponents for Juve, having also
held them to a 1-1 draw earlier in the season.


Juve coach Didier Deschamps admitted Albinoleffe were a hard nut
to crack.


"They kept things really tight at the back," said the former
France international.


"I don't want to make excuses, but they didn't allow us any space
to play.


"In any attacking situation we had, they had eight men behind the
ball."


Second-placed Genoa moved closer to Juve after their 2-1 win at
local rivals Spezia.


Juve have 59 points from their 30 matches played, while Genoa,
who have played a game more, have 55 points. Napoli are third on
53 points after their 3-2 victory at promotion rivals Bologna.


The top two in the division qualify automatically for promotion.


Last summer Juventus were demoted from Serie A and given a nine-
point handicap in Serie B for their role in the Italian match-
fixing scandal.
