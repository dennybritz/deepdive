Bound with chains and speared by cactus barbs, thousands of
chain-bound Mexicans marked Good Friday with a march aimed at
giving thanks to Jesus for their good fortune in immigrating to
the United States.


"Faith is what motivates me, and to give something back to God
because I have received many blessings, many opportunities and I
have made progress thanks to Him," Raul Barcenas told AFP.


His chest bare, his head wrapped in black cloth and chains
binding his ankles, Barcenas joined other penitents in the annual
kilometer (half-mile) long procession that aims to replicate
Jesus's trip to the crucifixion.


He said he works for a Texas company on the other side of the
border, 700 kilometers (430 miles) away, where he has lived for
the last 20 years, but promises "to come back every year to
participate in this procession."


"Like for anyone who goes the United States, it was hard at the
beginning. I worked as a dishwasher in restaurants, worked as a
laborer on building sites and house construction.


"I only was able to get my papers six years ago," he added.


Most of those who participate in the two-hour march are natives
of the central Mexican state of Puebla.


Before setting off, they endure a painful shower of cactus spines
which is meant to recreate Jesus's crown of thorns.


Around 11 million Mexicans, three to five million of whom are
illegal immigrants, are living in the United States where they
make up 3.8 percent of the population according to official
estimates.
