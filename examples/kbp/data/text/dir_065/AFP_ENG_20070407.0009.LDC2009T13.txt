Two miners were killed and seven others were reported missing
after an explosion at a coal mine in northwest China's Gansu
province, state press reported Saturday.


The accident occurred late Friday in Yaojie township of the city
of Lanzhou, Xinhua news agency said, quoting an official with the
provincial coal mine safety administration.


Rescuers found three miners early Saturday, but two of them later
died of gas poisoning, the report said.


A local official said Saturday the chances of survival for the
missing miners were "very slim".


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
