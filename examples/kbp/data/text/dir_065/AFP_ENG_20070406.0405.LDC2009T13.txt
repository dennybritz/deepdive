The world's most famous homemaker, Martha Stewart, spent Friday
at a space rocket launch site in Kazakhstan, where her partner
Charles Simonyi will blast off Saturday to show off his own
household skills on board the International Space Station.


Simonyi, a billionaire software programmer, plans to demonstrate
his cooking skills Thursday, whipping up some French culinary
delights on the International Space Station to celebrate Russia's
Cosmonaut Day.


"One of the dishes has a wine sauce that is very common in French
cuisine. I think that the crew will be very happy to eat
something different after all this time in space."


The sauce in question will not break the station's no-alcohol
rule, Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin assured reporters.


Stewart, who arrived Friday, spoke with Simonyi from behind a
widow to the room where he was in quarantine along with other
crew members ahead of the flight.


Asked if she was worried about the mission, Stewart told AFP:
"I'm not nervous. They are really well trained."


The American homemaking guru said she saw a rainbow over the
launchpad, which she inspected during the day, but organizers of
Simonyi's trip to space said the couple would not be getting too
carried away in the Kazakh steppe.


"They are not getting engaged tomorrow," said Space Adventures
spokeswoman Stacey Tearne.
