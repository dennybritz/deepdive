The US military said Saturday that one more soldier has been
killed in Baghdad in a roadside bomb attack taking to 16 the
number of soldiers who died in the war-torn country this month.


"While conducting a combat security patrol, one soldier died and
four others were wounded when an explosively-formed projectile
detonated in an eastern section of the Iraqi capital April 6,"
the military said in a statement.


The military alleges that such devices are supplied to Iraq's
Shiite militias by Iranian elements.


American officials say the EFPs have previously been found in
Lebanon where it is believed to have been supplied by Iran to
Hezbollah.


The latest fatality brought the US military's losses in Iraq to
3,264, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
