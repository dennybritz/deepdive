German pair Tommy Haas and Philipp Kohlschreiber won their
respective rubbers over Belgian opponents Friday to boost their
bid for a semi-final place in the Davis Cup World Group.


Old hand Haas overcame a tight start in his match against
"unpredictable" Belgian Kristof Vliegen before emerging with a
6-7 (4/7), 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 victory which gave Germany the early
lead.


Davis Cup debutant Kohlschreiber then went on to make relatively
light work of Belgian number one Olivier Rochus, whose 6-3, 7-5,
7-6 (7/4) defeat also did much to zap the local players' morale.


On-form Germany are now expected to make the final four, and have
at least one other good reason to back up that belief.


Dick Norman and Christophe Rochus will team up for Belgium in a
bid to save their campaign against Alexander Waske and Michael
Kohlmann in their doubles rubber on Saturday.


However the Belgian men, who are going through a bad patch, have
rarely been triumphant in the wide court game.


The 29-year-old Haas won the opening rubber in three hours, 18
minutes on his third match point.


"There was enormous pressure," Haas said afterwards. "The second
set was very important and had I not been able to get back into
the match then, it would have got very tight. Vliegen is a really
unpredictable opponent."


The winner of this best-of-five rubber tie will move into the
September 21 to 23 semi-finals against either title holders
Russia or France, which for Germany would mean away matches
against either opponent.
