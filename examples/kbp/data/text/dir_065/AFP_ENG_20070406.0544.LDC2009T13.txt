Carrying the Houston Rockets is apparently exacting a toll on
stars Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady.


Both McGrady and Yao were both inactive for the Rockets' National
Basketball Association contest against the Portland Trail Blazers
on Friday due to back problems.


McGrady's absence comes just two days after the swingman managed
to play just six minutes in the first quarter of Wednesday's
110-99 loss to Golden State with a stiff lower back.


Yao, who is listed as day-to-day with a sore lower back, is
unaware of how he suffered his injury after scoring nine points
and grabbing 11 rebounds in 30 minutes against the Warriors.


"I don't remember exactly how I hurt it, but probably in the last
game someone hit on my back," Yao said. "I didn't worry about it
yesterday because it was our day off, but today I came in and
started working and it started hurting."


Yao spoke with team trainer Keith Jones, who suggested the
Chinese center take the day off. Yao didn't yet know if he would
be able to play Sunday at Sacramento.


Yao had been averaging 22.7 points and 10.1 rebounds in 16 games
since returning from a broken right leg on March 5.


The Rockets, who boast a record of 47-28 and have already
clinched a playoff berth, are fifth in the Western Conference
standings despite losing their last two games.
