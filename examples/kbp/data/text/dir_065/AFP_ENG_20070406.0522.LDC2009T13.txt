Israeli helicopters fired three missiles into the northern Gaza
Strip early on Saturday injuring three Palestinians militants,
witnesses said.


"The helicopters opened fire after suspect movements near the
security barrier (between Israel and the Gaza Strip) to the east
of Jabaliya" refugee camp, said an Israeli army spokesman.


The rockets injured armed militants from Islamic Jihad and the
Popular Resistance Committees, witnesses said.


Israeli tanks also moved several metres into the Gaza Strip, the
witnesses said.


On Wednesday Israeli troops entered the Gaza Strip in the first
incursion since a November ceasefire, killing one Palestinian
militant.


Israel withdrew all troops from the Gaza Strip in November as
part of a ceasefire after six months of military operations aimed
unsuccessfully at freeing captured soldier Gilad Shalit and
halting the rocket fire.


But some militant groups have refused to abide by the ceasefire
deal and have since fired 155 rockets at Israel, according to the
army. In December rocket fire wounded two teenagers in the
Israeli community of Sderot.


On March 28, Israel launched its first strike against a militant
rocket team in the northern Gaza Strip since the November
ceasefire, but no soldiers entered Gaza during that strike.
