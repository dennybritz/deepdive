The White House on Friday condemned as "unfortunate and extremely
disappointing" any mistreatment by Iran of British naval
personnel held captive by Tehran for roughly two weeks.


"What the sailors said this morning is unfortunate and extremely
disappointing if they were treated inappropriately in any way,"
national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters.


"If what they described is accurate, and I have no reason to
believe it is not, if what they described is accurate then that
would not seem to be appropriate behavior and action," said
Johndroe.
