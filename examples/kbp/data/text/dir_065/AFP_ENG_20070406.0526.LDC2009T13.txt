UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday called on all
parties in East Timor to make the country's first presidential
election since independence a free and fair one.


"I hope the elections will be free, fair, transparent and
credible. I hope they will be unmarred by violence and
intimidation, and I hope they will lead to results accepted by
all," Ban said in a message broadcast on local radio.


"The way these elections are conducted will be decisive in
setting the tone for how your society develops in the future,"
the UN secretary general said.


"The eyes of the world are upon you. I call on all candidates and
their supporters to accept the results in a peaceful manner."


Voters go to the polls on Monday to elect the successor to Xanana
Gusmao, with Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel peace
laureate, considered to be a strong contender.


The powerful Fretilin party chairman, Fransisco Guterres, and
Fernando "Lasama" De Araujo, who chairs the opposition Democrat
Party, are also considered to be viable candidates. Gusmao is not
seeking re-election.


At least 32 people have already been injured in clashes this week
in and around the capital Dili, although most of the two-week
presidential campaign was peaceful, the UN said.


Violence has pulsed through the fledgling state since it gained
independence in 2002 after a period of UN stewardship. Indonesia
previously occupied the former Portuguese colony for a turbulent
24 years.
