Ryder Cup star Lee Westwood slammed the fabled Masters course at
Augusta National on Friday saying it had been made too difficult
for most of the players.


Scores soared in Thursday's opening round with an average of
around 76 and the Englishman was among those who struggled badly
with a seven-over 79.


He hit back on Friday with a 73, which left him on the cut, but
Westwood said he felt his play had probably deserved better.


"If you don't hit a perfect shot and sometimes even a perfect
shot is not good enough, you are going to make bogeys," he said.


"The course just asks too many questions that there is no answer
too.


"When the course was shorter, more of us would have had an answer
but now there are only six or seven people in the field who can
win it.


"It's a shame because it used to be a shot makers course but now
I don't think it is."


At 7445 yards, Augusta National is the second longest course used
in the history of the majors having been significantly lengthened
following Tiger Wood's record-breaking exploits in 1997.
