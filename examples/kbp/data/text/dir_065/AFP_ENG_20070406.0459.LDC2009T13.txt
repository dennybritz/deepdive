Russian star Pavel Datsyuk signed a seven-year contract extension
with the Detroit Red Wings on Friday.


The 28-year-old Datsyuk, who competed for Russia in the 2006
Turin Olympics, is a key component of the Wings' offence. He
leads the National Hockey League club in scoring this year with
27 goals and 87 points in 78 games.


Financial terms were not disclosed, but Canadian broadcaster
TSN.ca reported the deal is worth between six million dollars and
seven million dollars per season.


"This contract was extremely important to me," Datsyuk said.


Detroit has already clinched their sixth straight Central
Division title and needs one point to secure the top seed in the
Western Conference playoffs.


"Pavel is one of the world's most skilled players and has
developed into a bona fide superstar over the past two seasons,"
Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said.


"We think securing Pavel, who is moving into the prime of his
career, is key to ensuring the long-term success of this
franchise."


Datsyuk also led the Red Wings in scoring last season, when he
registered 28 goals and 87 points.


A 1998 sixth-round pick by the Red Wings, Datsyuk won the Stanley
Cup in his first season with the team in 2001-02. He also
captured the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play in the 2005-06
season.
