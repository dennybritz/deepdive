Los Angeles Lakers guard Smush Parker has lashed out at newly-
crowned Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson a day after he was
benched for part of Wednesday's game.


Parker, who has started every game since the Lakers signed him as
a NBA free agent in August 2005, did not play in the fourth
quarter of the Lakers' 90-82 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.


It is not the first time he has been benched. He and Jackson
exchanged words on the bench last month after Parker was removed
from a game against Phoenix in the final quarter.


Parker told the Los Angeles Times: "I felt I did everything I
need to do to be out there. I didn't appreciate being benched. I
gave up trying to read that man a long time ago."


They spoke again on Thursday and Parker said he wasn't happy.


"He talked. I listened," Parker said. "That's usually how it
goes. He just asked me if I got my energy back. I was like
'Energy? I never lost it'."


Jackson, who was named to the basketball Hall of Fame on Monday,
said he is looking for more jump from Parker.


"I just didn't feel like he had the enthusiasm to get up there
and press the ball and do the kind of things Shammond (Williams)
and Jordan (Farmar) and Sasha (Vujacic) would do," said Jackson,
who won nine titles as coach of the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles
Lakers.


Parker is in the second year of a two-year deal that pays him
about 800,000 dollars this season.


Jackson made it to the Hall of Fame on his first year of
consideration and his nine titles matches the late Boston Celtics
coach Red Auerbach's mark.
