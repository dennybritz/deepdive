Unidentified attackers petrol-bombed a Yemeni mosque Friday,
wounding 30 worshippers, eight of them seriously, the official
Saba news agency reported.


The attackers struck during the main weekly Muslim prayers at the
mosque in Amran province, north of the capital, the news agency
said.


"Thirty people suffered burns, eight of them serious ones, after
unknown individuals entered the mosque... and then proceeded to
spray the worshippers with petrol and set them alight," Saba
quoted a provincial official as saying.


Other members of the congregation suffered from the effects of
smoke inhalation, the official added.


There was no immediate word on who might have carried out the
attack or whether there was any connection with a deadly three-
year-old rebellion among the Zaidi minority in Yemen's northern
mountains.
