Three Iraqis and one Chinese woman have over the past few weeks
been arrested in Rotterdam and The Hague for trafficking people
to Britain, public prosecutors said on Friday.


"Three Iraqi men aged 33, 26 and 20 were arrested in mid-March
for involvement in trading Chinese, Iraqis and Indians by ferry"
between The Netherlands and Britain, it said in a statement.


A Chinese woman, 38, was arrested in The Hague on Tuesday, it
said, adding that the four suspects were in temporary custody.


The suspected traffickers were picked up following a check in
Harwich, the port in southeast England where 10 illegal
immigrants were found in a lorry in October.


According to the prosecutors, they charged immigrants up to 7,500
euros (10,000 dollars) for each journey.
