Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels set off a roadside explosion,
killing seven bus passengers and wounding 26 in northern Sri
Lanka Saturday, military sources said.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) set off the blast
outside the town of Vavuniya, 250 kilometres (156 miles) north of
Colombo, a military spokesman said. He said a soldier was among
those killed.


"A Claymore mine hit the bus as it was halfway through to the
destination," a military official said. "The bomb was rigged up
on a tree and manually triggered as the bus passed. It was the
work of the Tigers."


Five people were dead on admission to Vavuniya hospital, where
two passengers died because of their injuries, a hospital
official said, adding that seven soldiers were among those
wounded.


The attack came five days after a bomb exploded inside a bus in
the east of the island, killing 17 people and wounding 25.


Saturday's bombing came despite tight security across the
island's northern and eastern regions in a bid to prevent Tamil
Tiger attacks.


The Tamil rebels have waged a 35-year campaign for independence
that has claimed more than 60,000 lives in Sri Lanka.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
