Two Japanese nationals kidnapped in Paraguay went into a fifth
day of captivity on Friday with no apparent sign of progress in
negotiations to free them.


Hirokazu Ota, 62, the head of Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church
in the country, and his secretary were seized on Sunday in
Caaguazu, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of the capital,
Asuncion.


Feverish talks continued to secure the release of the Japanese
and a Paraguayan couple snatched when they witnessed the
abductions, National Police deputy commander Nestor Mendez said.
He did not provide any details.


Ota is the president of Victoria SA, a company that manages land
assets in Paraguay owned by other members of the South Korea-
based church.


Victoria has sparked controversy for several years for buying up
huge tracts of land in the Chaco region in the country's center.


Ota and his secretary were snatched as they were driving on the
road linking the capital with Ciudad del Este, some 330
kilometers (200 miles) to the east in the triangle where Paraguay
shares a border with Brazil and Argentina.


The secretary was identified in Paraguay as Sawako Takayama, but
reports in Japan gave her family name as Yamaguchi.


Ota has lived in Paraguay for 10 years.
