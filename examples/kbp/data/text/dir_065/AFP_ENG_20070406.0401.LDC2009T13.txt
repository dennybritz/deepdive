A Russian diplomat said Friday that Western nations' aid embargo
against the Palestinian government should end because the reasons
for it "are no longer operable," a news agency reported.


"Russia is for the lifting of the heavy weight on the
Palestinians as soon as possible," deputy foreign minister
Alexandre Saltanov told reporters, according to Interfax. "The
reasons used to take those economic measures against the
Palestinians are no longer operable."


Russia's security council secretary, Igor Ivanov, will visit
Israel and the Palestinian territories on Monday to discuss the
peace process there, Interfax reported.


Russia is part of the so-called Mideast Quartet that froze direct
aid to the Palestinian Authority after militant party Hamas swept
to power following elections last year. Hamas is regarded as a
terrorist organisation by the West.


Quartet members include the European Union, Russia, the United
Nations and the United States. They have consistently said any
new Palestinian government must recognise Israel, renounce
violence and respect past agreements.


Palestinians formed a new government last month, uniting Hamas
with president Mahmud Abbas's secular Fatah party. Abbas has
argued that the new government meets demands for recognition.


Many Western nations have eased their boycott by agreeing to meet
non-Hamas ministers, but have so far refused to resume direct aid
to the Palestinian Authority.
