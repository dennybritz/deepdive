Seve Ballesteros' return to the Masters after an absence of four
years reached a painful conclusion on Friday when the two-times
former winner finished his second round at 22-over par.


The Spaniard, three days short of his 50th birthday, carded a
second round of 80 which was still six strokes better than his
opening 86.


He started well enough and reached the turn in one-over 37, but
had a disastrous back nine, which included five bogeys and one
double bogey at the par-three 12th.


Ballesteros won his first Masters in superb style in 1980,
unleashing two decades of European domination of the year's first
major which saw him followed by Sandy Lyle, Bernhard Langer, Nick
Faldo, Ian Woosnam and finally Jose Maria Olazabal, whose second
triumph in 1999 remains Europe's last to date.


But with injuries and loss of form wrecking his game in the last
decade, he missed the cut on seven straight occasions from 1997
and gave Augusta a miss from 2003-2006.
