Iraq demanded an apology Friday for a coalition raid against a
police intelligence headquarters in the main southern city of
Basra which it said was an assault on its sovereignty.


A commission set up to investigate the March 4 raid carried out
by Iraqi special forces and coalition troops found that
commanders had "exceeded their powers" in conducting the raid
without the permission of the Iraqi judiciary.


"The troops committed an aggression against Iraq's sovereignty,"
said a statement from the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-
Maliki, who angrily ordered the inquiry after last month's raid.


"The committee concludes that multinational forces exceeded their
powers and henceforth should not carry out such raids alone. The
leader of the multinational forces must apologise to Iraqis and
the people of Basra."


British commanders, who oversee operations in Basra, said at the
time that the raid on an interior ministry intelligence
headquarters targeted militia infiltration of the security forces
and revealed "significant criminal activity such as torture".


But Maliki's office said the raid caused damage to the ministry
building and resulted in the release of more than 37 criminal
suspects.


"Multinational forces broke the door, destroyed the files
including those of suspects held in the centre, and even abused
Iraqi officials," the statement said.


"The troops also broke the prison and freed prisoners who were
facing criminal proceedings."


Iraqi police said at the time that US troops were involved in the
raid, although the city is normally patrolled by British forces.
