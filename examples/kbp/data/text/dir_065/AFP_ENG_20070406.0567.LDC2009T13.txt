At least five people were killed and 28 wounded in a roadside
blast targeting a civilian bus in northern Sri Lanka Saturday,
military sources said.


The bus was involved in the mine attack outside the town of
Vavuniya, 250 kilometres (156 miles) north of Colombo, a military
source said. He said a soldier was among those killed.


The attack came five days after a bomb exploded inside a bus in
the east of the island, killing 17 people and wounding 25.
