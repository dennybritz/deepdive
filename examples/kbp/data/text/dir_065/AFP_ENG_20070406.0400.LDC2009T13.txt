German historian Werner Maser, considered one of the world's
leading experts on Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime, has died at
the age of 84, his family said on Friday.


Maser won international acclaim with a biography of the late Nazi
dictator titled "Hitler: Legend, Myth and Reality." It was
published in 1971 and translated into 22 languages.


Another work, "Hitler's Letters and Notes," gave insight into his
thoughts and theories.


Maser was praised for his painstaking research.


He tracked down Hitler's medical records from 1905 to 1945 which
were for decades believed to have been lost, and was the first
historian to assert, rightly, that purported diaries of Hitler
published by Stern magazine in 1983 were forgeries.


His credibility was compromised, however, when he claimed in the
late 1970s to have tracked down Hitler's illegitimate son,
allegedly born of an 18-month liaison between the Fuehrer and a
peasant girl.


Maser wrote a book about the Nuremberg trials as well as an
analysis of the German-Soviet conflict under the German title
"Der Wortbruch: Hitler, Stalin and der Zweite Weltkrieg" in which
he controversially claimed that Soviet troops were poised to
invade the Third Reich in 1941.


He penned a biography of former German chancellor Helmut Kohl,
which appeared in 1990, and also wrote about the Weimar Republic
presidents Friedrich Ebert and Paul von Hindenburg.


Maser's family said he died in hospital in the western German
city of Speyer on Thursday.
