Two Malaysian men have been arrested in Cambodia on charges of
attempting to smuggle 2.2 kilogrammes (five pounds) of
amphetamines to Kuala Lumpur, police said Saturday.


Wong Ken Kiong, 41, and Wong Koon Ming, 49, were arrested Friday
at Phnom Penh International Airport as they went through routine
security checks before their planned departure, said Thong
Sophat, deputy chief of airport police.


"We noticed that their behaviour did not look normal, and they
trembled as they walked through security," he told AFP.


A body search revealed that they had strapped the drugs to their
thighs and hidden some in their underwear, he added. The two men
had entered the country as tourists on Tuesday, he said.


Impoverished Cambodia is becoming an increasingly popular
trafficking point for narcotics, particularly methamphetamines
and heroin, after neighbouring Thailand toughened its stance on
illegal drugs in 2002.
