A baby died and more than 20 people were injured when a packed
train slipped off the tracks in Indonesia's Central Java province
early Saturday, reports said.


Five carriages of a train from Jakarta derailed near Tegal, a
town on the north coast of Java island, killing the baby and
injuring at least 23 people, detikcom news portal reported.


The distraught mother of eight-month-old baby boy Seno Redho
Kurniawan told ElShinta radio that she was asleep when the
accident happened.


"I have been away to Jakarta for a month and on my way home to
Semarang," said Ika Aromawati, who is six months' pregnant with
her second child and was only slightly injured.


Detikcom reported that the tracks had not yet been cleared.


"We have to examine the condition of each carriage... and
consider what equipment (to use)," Indonesian Railway officer
Suprapto told detikcom.


Accidents are relatively common on Indonesian railways.


President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono formed a special team in
January to evaluate the country's transport safety and security
following recent air and sea disasters.
