Oasis, The Killers and Kaiser Chiefs are to record their own
versions of tracks from The Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band" to mark the legendary album's 40th anniversary.


The rock bands, alongside The Fratellis, Travis, Razorlight and
James Morrison, are making cover versions for a special two-hour
BBC radio programme.


The famous album by the Fab Four includes such songs as "A Day in
the Life", "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", "When I'm Sixty-Four"
and "With a Little Help from My Friends".


Geoff Emerick, the audio engineer who recorded the original album
at Abbey Road studios in north London, will record the new
versions using the very same four- track equipment.


"This will be not only a unique radio event, but a very special
musical moment," said Lesley Douglas, controller of the BBC Radio
2 channel.


"The range and quality of artists involved ensure that this will
be a fitting tribute to one of the great albums of all time."


"Sgt. Pepper" was The Beatles' eighth album and was released on
June 1, 1967.


The BBC anniversary broadcast airs on June 2.
