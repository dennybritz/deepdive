Sectarian clashes continued despite a curfew in a remote northern
Pakistani town Saturday, leaving at least eight people dead and
45 wounded in two days, officials said.


Authorities clamped down Friday after fighting broke out between
Sunni and Shiite Muslims in Parachinar, 230 kilometres (142
miles) south of Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier
Province.


"Eight people have been killed and 45 are wounded in sporadic
exchanges of mortars and gunfire between the rival groups," said
Sahibzada Anees, head of the political administration of the
area.


He said troops were patrolling the streets in the town nestled in
the Hindu Kush mountains, which has a history of sectarian
violence involving Shiite and Sunni communities.


Clashes between the two communities over a shrine last year left
around 20 people dead.


Anees said trouble erupted on Friday after members of the Shiite
community staged a demonstration outside their mosque against
local Sunnis who allegedly chanted anti-Shiite slogans during a
religious rally last week.


Shiites, who account for about 20 per cent of Pakistan's 160
million Sunni- dominated population, are in the majority in
Parachinar.


Sectarian violence involving Sunni and Shiite militants has
claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late 1980s.
