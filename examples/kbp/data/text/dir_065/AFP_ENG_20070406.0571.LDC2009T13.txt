The New York Yankees were less worried about their 6-4 loss to
Baltimore Friday than they were about the possible loss of All-
Star shortstop Derek Jeter.


Jeter left the game in the top of the ninth with a right foot
injury. Jeter fouled a pitch off the foot earlier in the game but
he continued to play. X-rays on the right foot were negative, but
Jeter's status was uncertain.


Nick Markakis and Jay Gibbons drove in two runs apiece, Markakis
opening the scoring with a two-run double in the first inning off
New York starter Mike Mussina.


Gibbons added a two-run single in the third for a 4-2 lead.


Mussina struggled against his former team, allowing six runs,
eight hits and three walks while striking out four in four
innings.


Baltimore starter Adam Loewen, who went 2-1 with a 2.63 ERA
against the Yankees as a rookie last season, earned the win for
the Orioles, whose new-look bullpen held off several Yankee
threats.


Loewen allowed two runs, five hits and two walks while striking
out two in five innings.


Chris Ray, the fifth Baltimore reliever, pitched the ninth inning
for his first save of the season.
