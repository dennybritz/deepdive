Japan booked a spot in the play-off for the Davis Cup world group
by winning a doubles match against Thailand Saturday, a day after
sweeping the two opening singles matches.


Satoshi Iwabuchi paired with Japanese ace Takao Suzuki to beat
Thai twin brothers Sonchat and Sanchai Ratiwatana 6-3, 6-4, 2-6,
6-4 at Namihaya Dome for an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the
Asia/Oceania Zone second round.


On Friday, Suzuki powered past Weerapat Doakmaiklee 6-4, 6-2, 6-3
and Go Soeda overwhelmed Kittipong Wachiramanowong 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.


Thailand were without their top two players -- 2002 Asian Games
gold medallist Paradorn Srichaphan and 2006 champion Danai
Udomchoke -- who are sidelined due to injuries.
