Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang is to elect a new leader
Saturday, following former chairman Ma Ying-jeou's resignation
over an indictment for corruption.


Some 400,000 Kuomintang (KMT) members will choose between former
acting chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and female lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu.


Voting will end at 4:00 pm (0800 GMT), with the result expected
two hours later, the party said.


Wu, 67, served as interior minister and presidential secretary
general between 1991-1996 when the KMT was the ruling party.
Hung, 59, has been a member of parliament since 1990.


The KMT was forced to hold the by-election after former Taipei
mayor Ma stepped down as chairman in February after being
indicted for embezzlement.


Ma, a former graft-buster who has been battling corruption claims
since November, was indicted for allegedly misusing more than 11
million Taiwan dollars (333,330 US) in expense accounts as Taipei
mayor.


But the 56-year-old defiantly announced he was running for
president in 2008, a move that unexpectedly boosted his
popularity.


Last year Ma admitted that one of his aides had swapped receipts
in claiming his mayoral expenses for 2003-2006.


Ma has apologised for the "serious administrative flaws" but
denied prior knowledge of the aide's actions or any attempt at
embezzlement.


He was elected KMT chairman in July 2005 and oversaw the party's
landslide victory in local government chief elections five months
later.
