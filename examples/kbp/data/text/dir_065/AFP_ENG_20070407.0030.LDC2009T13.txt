A small Japanese cargo boat sank off Japan's Pacific coast after
colliding with a freighter Saturday, leaving one crewman missing,
the coastguard said.


The two boats collided 3.6 kilometres (2.3 miles) off Cape Esu on
the Kii peninsula, some 450 kilometres (280 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, at 5:15 am (2015 GMT Friday), a coastguard spokesman said.


The 313-tonne cargo boat Eifuku Maru No. 7 sank with a crew of
four and its 65 -year-old chief engineer, Hideo Okamoto, was
missing, the spokesman said. It was hauling some 1,000 tonnes of
scrap iron along the peninsula.


The Cambodian-flagged freighter, the 1,208-tonne Yin He No. 1,
with a crew of 10 Chinese, sustained damage to its port side but
could sail on its own power.


It was on its way from Shanghai to Nagoya, central Japan.


"It was raining at the time of the accident but the sea was
calm," the spokesman said, adding that five coastguard boats, one
helicopter and a patrol plane were searching for the missing
crewman.
