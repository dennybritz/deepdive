At least 12 people were killed and 16 injured in southern India
when a car believed to be carrying explosives blew up, police
said.


"The engine of the car caught fire. Twelve people have died," a
police official, who did not wish to be named, said, adding the
car appeared to carrying explosives.


The blast occurred at Chendur village some 130 kilometers (80
miles) from Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu state.


Most of the victims were villagers who had gathered near the car
to douse the flames. The rest were roadside shopkeepers.


The car was headed to the south of the state towards the coast,
from where police say explosives are often smuggled to northern
Sri Lanka, where rebel Tamil Tigers are waging a deadly
insurgency.
