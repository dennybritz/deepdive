A Croatian activist Friday completed a 24-hour stay in a chicken
cage in a central square in Zagreb to urge people not to eat eggs
on Easter Sunday.


But one man attempted to scramble the stunt. He showed up with a
bag full of eggs and bombarded the caged man and other activists
before police stopped him.


Despite the interruption, Luka Oman completed his self-
imprisonment and exited the cage Friday at noon.


Oman is president of an organisation called Friends of Animals,
which wanted to draw attention to the industrial production of
poultry.


"We are calling for people not to eat eggs and to buy wooden eggs
for Easter," said Anita Eushen of Friends of Animals.


Oman said chickens raised industrially for the purpose of laying
eggs undergo "unimaginable suffering."


About 88 percent of Croatia's 4.4 million residents identify
themselves as Catholic and celebrate the Christian holiday of
Easter.
