A European Union envoy told AFP Friday that he had asked Brussels
to investigate whether Ethiopian and Somali forces committed war
crimes in their recent crackdown on Islamist and clan insurgents
in Mogadishu.


An Ethiopian offensive against insurgents last week triggered
four days of the worst fighting in Mogadishu in more than 15
years, killing hundreds and forcing tens of thousands to flee.


Eric van der Linden, the EU envoy to Nairobi, told AFP that he
had forwarded an email from one of his officials to EU
headquarters in Brussels questioning whether "indiscriminate use
of force in heavily populated areas amounted to war crimes".


"It is up to my headquarters to follow up on that and not me," he
added.


Ethiopian forces helped the Somali transitional government drive
Islamist fighters with alleged links to the Al-Qaeda network out
of south and central Somalia some three months ago.


Elders from Mogadishu's dominant Hawiye clan said they had held
talks with Ethiopian commanders Friday, after reaching a
tentative ceasefire deal five days ago, which Ethiopia has not
confirmed.
