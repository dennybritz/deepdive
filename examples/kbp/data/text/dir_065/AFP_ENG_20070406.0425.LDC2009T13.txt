A pregnant young woman living in London was shot dead Friday over
what may have been a parking dispute, police said.


Krystal Hart, 22, was murdered at her home in Clapham, southwest
London.


"Police were called to this house shortly after 11:00 am (1000
GMT) and when police arrived we found a young girl had been shot
in her home," Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton said
outside.


"We think that this took place as a result of some kind of
dispute... possibly about parking."


He said Hart was shot at "very close range" and probably with a
handgun. Police had some suspects "in mind," he added.


"We have some good lines of inquiry and we are quite confident
that we can resolve this reasonably quickly."


Sutton said the victim's family had confirmed that she was at
least six weeks pregnant.
