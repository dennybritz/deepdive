A rare work by prominent artist Xu Beihong fetched a record 64
million Hong Kong dollars (8.16 US) for a Chinese oil painting at
auction here Saturday.


Auctioneers Sotheby's had said the 1939 painting of an anti-
Japanese street play, "Put Down Your Whip," was expected to fetch
at least 30 million Hong Kong dollars (3.8 million US).


"This painting is of historic value because Xu had never painted
another picture of an anti-Japanese theme," a Sotheby's
spokeswoman said.


Xu's work is the highlight of the auction house's Contemporary
Chinese Art sale, offering 180 lots of Chinese art pieces.


The last record that Xu set was in November 2006 when his work
"Slave and Lion" was sold at Christie's for 53.9 million Hong
Kong dollars.


The patriotic Xu, who was renowned for his horse paintings, was
inspired to paint "Put Down Your Whip" after watching a street
play in Singapore about a father and his daughter in wartime
exile due to the Japanese invasion.


The life-size female character in the painting was Xu's actress
friend Wang Ying.


Sotheby's said the picture had been exhibited several times when
Xu was still alive, but it was last seen in public in 1954 -- a
year after Xu died -- since when it has been passed between
collectors.
