English hope Paul Casey outscored playing partner Tiger Woods by
six strokes in the second round of the Masters on Friday but was
left impressed by the world No.1s game.


In particular, Casey cited an incident on the back nine which he
said was indicative of the unmatched intensity the American
brings to the game.


"I got a chance to witness one of his stalled swings on the 13th
tee today. I hope they got it on camera," he said.


"A couple of birds flew over and the shadows went across the ball
and of all the things I've seen him do, unbelievable.


"He was fully loaded on the way down and managed to stop himself
which was pretty impressive. I don't know how he didn't break
something."


Woods agreed.


"Birds flew right over me, stopped it somehow," he said.


"I felt like I broke my back, my wrist, my neck, legs. I don't
know how those baseball players do it, that check-swing.


"I felt like the shaft was going to snap because the head passed
forward."


Casey and Woods finished the second round level on three-over par
147, well in contention for the weekend.
