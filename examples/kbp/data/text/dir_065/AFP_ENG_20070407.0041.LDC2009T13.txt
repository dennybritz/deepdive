Israeli fire wounded a Palestinian militant commander on its most
wanted list early Saturday in the northern West Bank town of
Jenin, his militant group said.


Zakaria Zubeidi, who became infamous in Israel after female
Israeli friend Tali Fahima was detained three years ago for
aiding and abetting his operations and jailed until January this
year, was the victim of an Israeli assassination attempt,
officials of his Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades said.


But the Israeli army insisted troops returned fire during a
routine operation.


"Zakaria Zubeidi was wounded in a targeted operation by the
Israeli army aimed at assassinating him," said a source from the
Al-Aqsa Martyrs, an armed offshoot of president Mahmud Abbas's
mainstream Fatah faction.


Zubeidi took a bullet to the shoulder, the source added.


An Israeli army spokesman said: "During a routine operation in
Jenin, our soldiers came under attack with small arms and
explosives and returned fire."


Zubeidi was unbowed by his injuries however and vowed to carry on
his campaign of armed resistance.


"My men will continue to fight against the Israeli army as long
as it continues to carry out incursions into Palestinian towns,"
the militant commander told the Ynet website of Israel's top-
selling daily Yediot Aharonot.


Zubeidi said that his men had detonated a bomb to halt the
advance of 15 Israeli military vehicles and a bulldozer into
Jenin refugee camp.
