The UN refugee agency will begin next week the voluntary
repatriation of refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo
who have been living in Mozambique, officials said Friday.


The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says some 3,500 DRC
nationals are located at Maratane, the last remaining refugee
camp in Mozambique.


An initial group of about 200 refugees will be flown from the
northern city of Nampula back to the DRC next week, said Victoria
Akyeampong, the UN refugee agency's representative in Mozambique.
She did not give precise dates.


After the war-torn DRC held democratic elections last year, many
refugees indicated they wanted to return, she said.


About 20 have paid for their own return, passing through
Tanzania, said Akyeampong.


Besides Congolese refugees, the camp also hosts 1,000 Rwandans
and 500 Burundians. It was opened in 2001.
