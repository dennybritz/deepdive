The Chilean airline company LAN announced Friday it was ordering
52 new aircraft, including 40 Airbus, as part of a 2.6 billion
dollar investment plan over the next five years.


The new purchases would bring the size of LAN airlines' fleet to
115 planes, 102 of which are for passengers and the rest for
freight, company president Jorge Awad said.


The company plans to purchase four Boeing 777 for freight, as
well as 36 Airbus A320, four Airbus A340 and eight Boeing 767-300
for passengers.


The investment is to be partially financed by the offer on the
Chilean and New York Stock Exchanges of 22 million shares worth
320 million dollars.


The company said it expects to see profit of 3.6 billion dollars
this year, an 18.6 percent increase over 2006.
