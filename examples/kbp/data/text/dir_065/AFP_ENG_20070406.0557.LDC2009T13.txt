Bangladesh have been given the go-ahead to replace injured
paceman Tapash Baisya with all-rounder Farhad Reza at the World
Cup, the International Cricket Council announced on Saturday.


Baisya suffered an ankle injury during Bangladesh's Super Eights
defeat against Australia in Antigua last week.


"The reports indicated Baisya will require six to eight weeks of
rehabilitation before he regains full fitness so the (World Cup)
technical committee has approved Reza as replacement," said an
International Cricket Council statement.


The 20-year-old Reza, who has played 12 one-day internationals,
is the eighth replacement player to be called up for the
tournament so far.


Pakistan replaced Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif,
while New Zealand brought in replacements for Daryl Tuffey and
Lou Vincent -- who both suffered injuries during the tournament.


Australia had to replace spearhead Brett Lee, who suffered an
ankle injury before the World Cup started.


England were Thursday allowed to replace their paceman Jon Lewis
with quick bowler Stuart Broad.
