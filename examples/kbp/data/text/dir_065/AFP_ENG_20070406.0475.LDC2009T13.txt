James Blake handed the United States a 1-0 lead over Davis Cup
World Group quarter-final rivals Spain Friday with a 6-4, 6-3,
6-4 victory over Tommy Robredo.


Blake, ninth in the world, was coming off a desperate run of form
last month on home hardcourts, winning only one match at two
events at Indian Wells and Miami.


But the 27-year-old American, who made his Davis Cup debut six
years ago at this North Carolina venue, suddenly came alive at
the right moment at this indoor hardcourt event to put the hosts
into an early lead.


Andy Roddick, the world number three, was set to test a recent
hamstring strain as he faced Spain's crafty left-hander Fernando
Verdasco.


Roddick owns a 5-2 all-time lead over the Spaniard, winning their
last three matches, including a five-setter at the US Open last
year.


Blake had it all his way in the first two sets and early in the
third as he went up a break against the sixth-ranked Robredo.


But leading 5-2 in the third, the American had to battle nerves,
losing serve for 5-3. Robredo then saved a match point in the
next game as Blake tightened further.


The American broke free to win in one hour, 57 miunutes as he
came good on his fourth match point, a volley into the empty
court.
