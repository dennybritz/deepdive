Leaders of Russia's Catholic community voiced hope that closer
ties between Catholic and Orthodox parish priests and believers
would help bridge differences on higher levels.


"It is important to develop Catholic-Orthodox ties on the local
level, between priests and parishioners. Such contacts prepare
ground for contacts on a higher level," the secretary-general of
Russia's Catholic Bishops' Conference Igor Kovalevsky said Friday
as quoted by Interfax.


Relations between the Orthodox Church and the Holy See have been
thorny, with the Moscow Patriarchate accusing the Vatican of
proselytizing in traditionally Orthodox lands following the
breakup of the Soviet Union.


Tensions were further aggravated in 2002, after the Vatican
established four permanent dioceses in Russia.


There are no exact figures on the number of Catholics in Russia.
While the Vatican claims 1.5 million faithful, local Catholic
officials estimate 600,000 and Russian Orthodox officials say
there cannot be more than 100,000 believers.
