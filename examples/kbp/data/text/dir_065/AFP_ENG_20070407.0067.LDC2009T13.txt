Pirates have released a UN-chartered cargo ship and an Indian
dhow they captured in the unpatrolled waters off the coast of
Somalia, a maritime official said Saturday.


Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers' Assistance Programme said the
hijackers freed the MV Rozen on Friday, more than a month after
it was seized after delivering relief food shipped by the UN
World Food Programme.


"Information reaching us indicates that MV Rozen has been
released and it is expected in Mombasa anytime," Mwangura told
AFP. "It was released yesterday. We are told that the crew is
fine."
