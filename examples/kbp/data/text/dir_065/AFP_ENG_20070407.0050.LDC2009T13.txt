Felipe Massa in a Ferrari took pole position for Sunday's
Malaysian Grand Prix here Saturday.


The 25-year-old Brazilian clinched the spot in a dramatic last-
gasp lap in the final seconds of Saturday's tense qualifying
session.


Massa clocked a best lap of one minute and 35.043 seconds to
secure the fourth pole of his career.


He wound up narrowly ahead of defending champion Fernando Alonso
of Spain in a McLaren Mercedes-Benz, with Ferrari team-mate Kimi
Raikkonen of Finland taking third place just ahead of young
British tyro Lewis Hamilton in the second McLaren.


This group of four were half a second clear of fifth-placed
German Nick Heidfeld in a BMW Sauber and German-born Nico Rosberg
in a Williams Toyota.
