Prince William was "deeply saddened" to learn that one of the
female British soldiers killed Thursday in Iraq was one of his
close friends and colleagues, his office said Friday.


Jo Dyer graduated from the elite Sandhurst military academy
alongside William in December, in front of his grandmother Queen
Elizabeth II.


The army second lieutenant was killed by a roadside bomb attack
west of the southern city of Basra, along with three colleagues
and a local civilian interpreter.


"Prince William is deeply saddened to hear the tragic news of Jo
Dyer's death," the 24-year-old's Clarence House residence said.


"Jo was a close friend of his at Sandhurst and he is very much
thinking of her family and friends right now and they will remain
in his thoughts and prayers."


Dyer was attached to the Second Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's
Regiment to gain operational experience in Iraq.


The deaths of Dyer and Private Eleanor Dlugsoz in Thursday's
attack brought to four the number of female British personnel
killed since the start of the US-led invasion in March 2003.


Overall, 140 British troops have died since hostilities began.


Lieutenant Colonel Mark Kenyon, Dyer's commanding officer, said:
"Her contribution to our operations, even within a few short
weeks, was invaluable."


Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday the deaths were "as a
result of a terrorist act."


William, second in line to the British throne, is an officer in
the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry. The
second lieutenant is known as Cornet Wales in the army.


William's brother Prince Harry, 22, is preparing to serve in
southern Iraq with the Blues and Royals.
