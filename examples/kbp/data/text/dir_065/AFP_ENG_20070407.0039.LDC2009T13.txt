Myanmar's military government has met with a top UN humanitarian
official in their new administrative capital Naypyidaw to discuss
cooperation with the world body, official media said Saturday.


The UN's deputy chief for humanitarian affairs Margareta
Wahlstrom met with Lieutenant General Thien Sein, the junta's
fifth-most powerful man, as well as the health minister and other
officials, the state-run New Light of Myanmar said.


The government mouthpiece newspaper gave no details of the
meeting, which came amid increased pressure on aid groups from
the military.


The International Committee of the Red Cross last month closed
two of its field offices, saying that its humanitarian work in
Myanmar was at "near-paralysis" because of obstruction by the
authorities.


The group has been barred from visiting prisons for more than a
year. Police say they stopped the visits because the ICRC had
favoured political prisoners.


In August 2006, the UN-initiated Global Fund to Fight Aids,
Tuberculosis and Malaria withdrew from Myanmar due to the junta's
restrictions on relief efforts.


But a group of European-led donors set up a new fund to fight
deadly diseases among Myanmar's 54 million people. The 100
-million-dollar Three Diseases Fund launched operations in
October.
