A tent city for the homeless on the banks of a Paris canal has
been shut down, said the "The Children of Don Quixote"
campaigning group that helped set it up.


Only a handful of tents were left along the Canal Saint-Martin,
which during the winter had housed several hundred tents and had
led politicians to step forward with promises to do more for
France's street dwellers.


"The Children of Don Quixote, after three months of struggle at
the Canal Saint- Martin, is withdrawing," the group said in a
statement, adding that while many people were still forced to
sleep in the streets, the camp had improved the lot of the
homeless.


With France in a feverish pre-election period ahead of the first
round of the presidential vote on April 22, the protest received
widespread media attention, prompting politicians of all stripes
to vow urgent action to tackle the problem of homelessness.


In a New Year's address to the nation President Jacques Chirac
called for an enforceable right to housing to be written into the
law, and Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin later presented a
bill to that effect which was adopted by parliament.


"The law on the enforceable right to housing enables us to hope
for a better future," said the Children of Don Quixote statement.


France has an estimated 100,000 homeless people, according to
advocacy groups, and their presence is very visible on the
streets of Paris and other cities.
