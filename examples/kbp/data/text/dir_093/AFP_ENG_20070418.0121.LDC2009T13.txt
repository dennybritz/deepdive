Malaysia's Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has promised to
urge Muslim countries to donate aid to war-torn Darfur after
visiting the region, a report said Wednesday.


Malaysia currently chairs the 57-nation Organisation of the
Islamic Conference (OIC).


Abdullah said he would "appeal to leaders of the OIC and Islamic
Development Bank in Jeddah to extend whatever help they can give
to the Sudanese government," according to the Star newspaper,
reporting from Khartoum.


Abdullah was on an official visit to Kenya Wednesday after
spending two days in Sudan where he told his hosts that Malaysia,
already a key trading partner with Khartoum, would extend
bilateral business ties.


Abdullah toured a refugee camp in Darfur, where more than 200,000
people are estimated to have been killed since 2003.


He said he was concerned with the plight of refugees in the
region, where an estimated two million people have been
displaced.


"Efforts must be made to improve conditions in the villages which
have been left behind by people who are now living in camps," he
said.
