German wind turbine maker REpower, currently coveted by French
company Areva, said late Tuesday that it supported a rival
takeover bid from India's Suzlon Energy, the world's fifth-
largest wind energy firm.


"Both the supervisory board and management apporve the offer of
Suzlon," REpower said in a statement, a week after the Indian
group raised its offer to 150 euros (204 dollars) per share or
1.34 billion euros in all.


Suzlon's offer is 10 euros per share higher than Areva's
competing bid of 140 euros per share.


REpower said that it regarded both Suzlon and Areva as
"appropriate strategic partners for the accelerated growth in the
international wind energy industry".


But since Suzlon's bid was higher, it supported the Indian
group's takeover offer.


On Tuesday, Areva had said that it would extend its offer until
May 4 and waive the minimum acceptance conditions for its offer
of more than 50 percent.


REpower supported the move.


Areva's decision "will increase the transaction safety and
comparability of both offers for shareholders," the German group
said.
