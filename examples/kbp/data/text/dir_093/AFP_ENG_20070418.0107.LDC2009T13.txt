A Malaysian logging boss accused of enlisting a Solomon Islands
politician to kill his rivals was freed on bail on Wednesday.


Joseph Wong was granted bail by the Solomon Islands magistrates'
court in the capital Honiara after spending two weeks in custody
on charges of inciting murder and grievous bodily harm.


The director of Silvania Logging allegedly offered 130,000
Solomon Island dollars (18,650 US) to legislator Charles Dausabea
to kill a logging rival and injure two others.


Dausabea, who is facing charges of inciting riots last year that
saw dozens of businesses razed in Honiara, turned the money over
to police.


According to the police charge sheet, Wong had approached
Dausabea on March 21 and asked him to kill the head of another
logging company.


This was followed by a second meeting on March 27 when Wong asked
Dausabea to arrange the bashing of two others from the rival
company.


Magistrate Chris Vass allowed bail and ordered Wong to reappear
on May 9.


Logging is big business in the impoverished island archipelago
where the industry is run by Asian logging syndicates.


The central bank has warned that the industry is unsustainable at
current levels.
