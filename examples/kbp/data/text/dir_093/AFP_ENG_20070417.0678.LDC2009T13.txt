Two suspected thieves were nabbed after mistakenly telephoning
police as they tried to set up a drug deal, police in California
said Tuesday.


The two men -- Paul White, 38, and Ryan Ogle, 25 -- were arrested
after dialing the emergency number 911 in an attempt to page a
drug dealer, Pomona police sergeant Eddie Vazquez said.


The misplaced phone call from a public booth alerted police, who
arrived on the scene and found the men standing beside a car
which had been reported as stolen, Vazquez said.


The men were arrested for various offenses, including auto theft,
parole violation and possession of burglary tools, he added.
