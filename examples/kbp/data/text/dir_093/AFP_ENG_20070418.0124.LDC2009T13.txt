EMI Group, the world's third-biggest music company but struggling
with sliding sales in the United States, said Wednesday that it
will pay no more dividends until 2009.


The British company meanwhile unveiled long-awaited plans to
borrow against its back catalogue of hit songs by artists
including the The Beatles and Coldplay.


The group, which has issued two profit warnings since the start
of 2007, said it hopes to issue debt secured against revenues
from its music publishing arm before the end of the current
fiscal year, ending in March 2008.


The music publishing division receives a fee each time one of its
catalogue tracks is played on the radio or used in a commercial,
and has steadier cash flows than the recorded music unit, which
has been hard hit by declining sales of compact discs in the
United States.


EMI's net debt stands at about 910 million pounds (1.347 billion
euros, 1.831 billion dollars), the group said on Wednesday.


"In view of the company's funding requirements, the board has
decided to suspend dividend payments until the benefits of the
restructuring process have been fully realised," EMI said in a
statement.
