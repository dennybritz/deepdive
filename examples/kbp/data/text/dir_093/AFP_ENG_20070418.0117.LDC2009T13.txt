US forces backed by a helicopter gunship conducted a raid near
Iraq's former rebel bastion of Fallujah on Wednesday, killing
five militants and arresting 30 others, the military said.


The operation was carried out in Karmah, a rural area northeast
of Fallujah in the restive Sunni province of Al-Anbar, west of
Baghdad.


The troops raided a group of buildings known to be used by
"terrorists" and found explosive materials in one of the
buildings, the military said, adding that a helicopter was also
called in to strike at the complex.


"During the operation, coalition forces were engaged by a group
of armed men and returned fire in self-defence, killing five and
wounding four," the military said.


Twenty-six people were detained during the operation and the
wounded were taken to military medical facilities.


Four years after the US-led invasion of Iraq, Anbar remains an
insurgent stronghold where US forces battle Sunni rebels on a
daily basis.
