Bank of England policymakers voted 7-2 to keep the key British
interest rate at 5.25 percent in April, minutes of their latest
meeting showed on Wednesday.


Two members had called for a quarter-point increase at the
meeting, which took place between April 4-5.


Analysts are widely expecting the central bank to increase
borrowing costs by a quarter point to 5.50 percent in May and
further still before the end of 2007 after data published Tuesday
showed British annual inflation had surged to a decade-high above
3.0 percent in March.


"For some members, there was no compelling case for a change in
interest rates this month," the minutes said.


"For these members there were particular uncertainties about the
outlook for the US economy and for UK consumption."


The minutes added: "Other members also concluded that no change
in Bank Rate was warranted this month, but that the balance of
risks to inflation remained on the upside in the medium term."


Two members, Tim Besley and Andrew Sentance, argued that the
balance of risks to the inflation outlook was "on the upside,"
thus warranting an immediate rise in the Bank's key rate to 5.50
percent.


After British 12-month inflation had hit 3.1 percent last month,
the highest level since 1997 and in breach of a government-set
ceiling of 3.0 percent, analysts believe the 5.50-percent rate
level will be achieved next month.
