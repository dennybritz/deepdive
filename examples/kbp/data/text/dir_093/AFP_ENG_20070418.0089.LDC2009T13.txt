Belgian banking and insurance group KBC announced on Wednesday
that it had acquired a 92.5-percent stake in Russia's Absolut
Bank for 761 million euros (1,034 million dollars).


KBC said in a statement that the deal values Absolut Bank,
established in 1993 in Moscow and Russia's seventh-largest non-
state-owned mortgage lender, at 3.8 times the company's book
value.


It said the deal would be subject to regulatory approval by the
Central Bank of Russia and the Anti-Trust Commission but that it
expects things to be finalised during the third quarter of 2007.


"Absolut Bank is a well managed, fast growing, independent bank
that constitutes an ideal platform for KBC's long-term presence
in this fast growing market," said KBC chief Andre Bergen.


Absolut, which welcomed the deal, has more than 1600 employees
and 39 branches and outlets, and posted a net profit of 20
million euros in 2006. KBC said it "intends to keep the current
key management in place".
