China will build a strategic uranium reserve in the coming years
as it pushes a plan for a massive expansion of its nuclear power
industry by 2020, state press said Wednesday.


The system for uranium will become China's third strategic
reserve after its strategic grain and oil reserves, the China
News Service reported.


Over the next 10 years, China will construct up to three nuclear
power plants each year, resulting in increased demand for nuclear
fuels of between four and six times current consumption, the
report said.


The nation's powerful Commission of Science Technology and
Industry for National Defense advocated the strategic uranium
reserve in its 11th five-year plan for nuclear energy development
that spans from 2006 to 2010, it said.


According to the plan, China will focus domestic uranium
exploration in the Yili Basin in northwestern China's Xinjiang
region and in the Ordos Basin in Inner Mongolia.


China will also seek uranium resources overseas, it said.


In February, China National Nuclear Corp said it signed a
strategic cooperation agreement with Sinosteel Corp to jointly
invest in and explore overseas for uranium resources. Sinosteel
is reportedly in talks to invest in uranium assets in Australia.


In January, Australia and China ratified a nuclear agreement
clearing the way for the export of up to 187 million dollars
worth of Australian uranium to China annually.


At the end of 2006, only 1.9 percent of China's total energy
needs were produced by nuclear power but this is set to increase
to four percent by 2020.
