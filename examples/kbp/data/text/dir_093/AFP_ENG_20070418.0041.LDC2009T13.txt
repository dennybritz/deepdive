China is cracking down on government workers' and Communist Party
cadres' habit of constructing extravagant office buildings for
themselves, state press reported Wednesday.


Expensive but less-than-vital features such as indoor gardens and
karaoke stages will be banned, said a circular from the cabinet
and the Communist Party carried by the People's Daily newspaper.


It said some recent luxurious construction projects had been
funded with poverty alleviation or disaster relief money.


"The trend is picking up with some local governments," the
circular said.


Official corruption, often visible in the luxurious lifestyles of
government cadres, has become a top cause of public discontent in
China and the government has said, year after year, that stamping
it out is a top priority.
