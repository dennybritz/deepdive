Hong Kong share prices closed the morning session little changed
Wedneday as the market went into consolidation mode after gains
of nearly 450 points in the last two sessions, dealers said.


The index got off to a good start after better-than-expected US
housing starts and consumer inflation data but gave up the gains
quickly due to profit-taking in select stocks.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 12.97 points
at 20,801.58.
