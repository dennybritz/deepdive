Pakistani authorities ordered an inquiry Wednesday after a jet
from the state- owned airline made an emergency landing in the
southern city of Karachi after developing a technical fault.


No passengers or crew were injured in the incident involving a
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Airbus A310 bound for the
central city of Faisalabad, an airline spokesman told AFP.


"A few minutes after take-off the captain of the aircraft found
some difficulty in the flight controls and asked the control
tower for an emergency landing," the spokesman said.


Some of the tyres deflated during the landing and the plane was
subsequently grounded, he added.


The Civil Aviation Authority said it had ordered an inquiry which
will be conducted by senior officials.


It was the second emergency landing of an airliner in Pakistan in
a week.


On Friday a private Shaheen Airlines Boeing 737 had to return to
the eastern city of Lahore due to pressurisation problems.


The European Union last month banned 37 PIA planes including
A310s from flying to Europe due to safety concerns. It will only
allow access to PIA's eight Boeing 777s.


PIA chairman Tariq Kirmani, who said the decision was
discriminatory, resigned shortly afterwards.
