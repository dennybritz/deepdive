Taiwan's Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) said Wednesday
a Carlyle Group-led consortium has decided to drop its offer to
buy the company due to irreconcilable differences over the price.


ASE, Taiwan's leading chip packaging and testing service
provider, said the consortium had agreed to increase the offer
price to 39.50 dollars (1.19 US) per share during a recent
meeting with its evaluation committee.


That was up from 39.00 dollars when Carlyle first announced its
intention in November to buy the firm but the evaluation
committee said it still did not adequately reflect the value of
ASE.


Stock market commentators have said the offer price for ASE
should be around 50 dollars. ASE shares closed Tuesday at 41.00
dollars.


The company said in February that Carlyle, one of the top US
private equity groups, agreed to terminate exclusive agreements
signed with its chief executive officer Jason Chang in November,
including a deal to acquire his 18.4 percent stake in ASE at 39
dollars per share.


The offer valued ASE at 5.46 billion US dollars.


After the agreement was signed, ASE authorised director T.C.
Cheng to set up a committee to assess the offer. The company said
termination of the arrangement was requested by the evaluation
committee and Chang.
