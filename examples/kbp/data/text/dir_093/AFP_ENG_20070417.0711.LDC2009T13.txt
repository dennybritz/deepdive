Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe denounced Wednesday the gang-
related assassination of the Nagasaki mayor as unforgivable and a
threat to democracy.


Iccho Ito was gunned down by a gangster as he campaigned for re-
election in the southern city, according to police.


"This criminal act during the election campaign is a challenge to
democracy. It cannot be forgiven no matter what," Abe told
reporters.


"We have to show our strong determination to get rid of such
violence."


Gun violence is rare in Japan, which strictly controls arms
possession.


Police said the suspect, identified as 59-year-old Tetsuya
Shiroo, belonged to a local gang affiliated with Japan's largest
organised crime syndicate, the Yamaguchi-gumi.
