Chinese share prices inched up to yet another record finish
Wednesday on sustained fund inflows, with power and steel stocks
gaining ground, dealers said.


They said the market managed to shrug off early profit-taking and
close higher on the back of continued capital inflows which
pushed volumes further into record territory.


About 60 companies rose by their daily limit of 10 percent as the
market chalked up a seventh record performance in eight days.


Shanghai A-shares were little changed overall but in Shenzhen,
which often follows its own lead, they were up sharply.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, closed up 0.53 points at a record 3,612.40 on turnover
of 167.42 billion yuan (21.66 billion US dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 0.32 points at 3,796.69 on
turnover of 166.47 billion yuan but the Shenzhen A-share Index
jumped 21.19 points or 2.04 percent at a record 1,058.17, on
turnover of 98.24 billion yuan.
