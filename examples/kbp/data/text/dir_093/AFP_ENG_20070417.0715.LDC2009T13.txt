The New Zealand dollar hit its highest level against the US
currency for 25 years on Wednesday after inflation data
reinforced expectations of further interest rate increases.


The New Zealand dollar hit 74.76 US cents in late morning trade
following the release of the inflation data.


The level was the highest since 1982 when the currency was in a
managed regime known as a 'crawling peg,' which limited its
movement.


The currency was floated freely at 44.44 US cents in March 1985.


The persistently high level of the dollar has raised alarm among
exporters, whose returns in New Zealand dollar terms are reduced
because most exports are sold in US dollar terms.


Inflation in the March quarter was 0.5 percent on a sequential
basis and 2.5 percent compared with a year earlier, which was
slightly below economist forecasts.


But inflation during the quarter in the non-tradeables sector --
which reflects inflation in the domestic economy -- was 1.2
percent, according to Statistics New Zealand.


This was the highest level since 2003 and was seen as likely to
prod the central bank into raising interest rates again at its
review next week.


The official New Zealand interest rate is already among the
highest in the developed world at 7.5 percent. The central bank
has a mandated guideline of one to three percent for controlling
inflation.


High interest rates have made the New Zealand currency attractive
to foreign investors while weakness in the US dollar has also
helped push the local unit higher.
