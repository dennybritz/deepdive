President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday vowed that Iran's
armed forces would "cut off the hand" of any enemy that launched
an attack on the Islamic republic.


"Our army has a defensive mission and not an offensive one. But
it is completely ready to confront any aggressor and cut off his
hand," Ahmadinejad told a military parade to mark Iran's army day
in a speech broadcast on state television.


The United States has refused to rule out the option of military
action to bring Iran to heel over its controversial atomic drive
which Washington says is aimed at making weapons. Iran insists
that its nuclear programme is peaceful.
