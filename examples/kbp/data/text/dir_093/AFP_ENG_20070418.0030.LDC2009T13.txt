Chinese insurance giant China Life reported better-than-expected
earnings for 2006 Wednesday, sending its stock price up 0.60
percent in early trade.


The Hong Kong-listed company announced net profit more than
doubled last year to 19.96 billion yuan (2.46 billion US dollars)
from 9.31 billion yuan a year earlier, topping analysts
forecasts.


China Life attributed the increase to a sharp rise in investment
returns.


"Some Investors were disappointed with the final dividend that
China Life declared considering the huge increase in earnings
last year," said Eugene Law, head of research at Celestial Asia
Securities Holdings.


China Life's board recommended a final dividend of 0.14 yuan a
share.


"However, most investors are taking a long-term view of China
Life and they are confident with its bright earnings prospects
going forward," he said.


In morning trade China Life's stock was up 0.15 Hong Kong dollars
at 25.30.
