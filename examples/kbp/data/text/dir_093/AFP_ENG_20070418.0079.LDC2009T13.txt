Two children, aged two and five, died in a fire that broke out in
their house in central Croatia where they were left alone by
their parents, police said on Wednesday.


The house, made mostly of wood, was burned to the ground in the
fire which broke out Tuesday in the village of Krbavica near the
central town of Korenica.


It was not immediately known what had caused the blaze.
