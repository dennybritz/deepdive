China has successfully created artificial snow in the mountainous
region of Tibet, raising hopes of a man-made solution to drought
and melting glaciers there, state media reported on Wednesday.


The artificial snowfall was engineered on April 10 at an altitude
of 4,500 metres (14,700 feet) in Nagqu country in northern Tibet,
Xinhua news agency said, quoting the local meteorological
station.


"The first artificial snowfall proves it's possible to change the
weather through human efforts on the world's highest plateau,"
said Yu Zhongshui, an engineer with the meteorological station.


The snowfall measured one centimetre (0.4 inches) deep.


"To launch artificial precipitation can help alleviate drought on
the grassland in northern Tibet," said Yu.


Xinhua did not give details of the method used but chemicals such
as silver iodide spread by aircraft or rockets are commonly used
in cloud seeding to increase rainfall in arid regions.


Recent Chinese meteorological studies have found precipitation is
declining and temperatures rising on the Tibetan plateau, a vital
hydrological region because it is the source of many major rivers
that flow through China and other countries.


The studies have noted the region's glaciers also were receding
at a rapid clip.
