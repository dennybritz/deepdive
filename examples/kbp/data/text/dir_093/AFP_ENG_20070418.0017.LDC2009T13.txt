Philippine President Gloria Arroyo on Wednesday expressed her
sympathy to the families of those gunned down in the deadliest
campus shooting US history.


"We are one with the world in condoling with the victims of the
senseless killings in Virginia Tech University," Arroyo said in a
statement.


"The unfortunate incident magnifies the need to keep all campuses
safe and secure at all times as sanctuaries of learning for the
youth," she said.


The Philippines offers "prayers and sympathies to the grieving
families, students, staff and faculty of Virginia Tech
University, and to the people of the United States during this
difficult time."


A 23-year-old South Korean student went on a shooting rampage at
the school Monday, killing 32 victims before training the gun on
himself.
