Nearly 1,000 Pakistani lawyers and opposition supporters held
fresh protests Wednesday against the removal of the country's top
judge by President Pervez Musharraf.


Crowds shouted "Go Musharraf, Go" outside the Supreme Court in
Islamabad, where suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad
Chaudhry was to appear before a judical council hearing
misconduct charges against him.


A lone pro-Musharraf man who appeared holding a picture of the
president was roughed up by female opposition workers outside the
court building, an AFP reporter said.


The man was shown being thrashed by the women who surrounded him,
snatched Musharraf's poster and tore it into pieces. The man was
later rescued by plain- clothed security men.


Police arrested scores of opposition activists in the capital and
nearby Rawalpindi late Tuesday, with newspapers saying up to 250
were detained. Political sources said others were held in the
eastern city of Lahore.


Military ruler Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led "war on
terror", dismissed Chaudhry on March 9, sparking nationwide
demonstrations and a tense political crisis in the volatile South
Asian nation.


The suspended chief justice has denied charges laid by Musharraf
that he abused his position to get his son a senior police job
and amassed a fleet of cars.


"President Musharraf has plunged the country into uncertainty by
confronting the judiciary," Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the head of
Pakistan's alliance of hardline Islamic parties, told AFP.
