Japanese ace Daisuke Matsuzaka issued a bases-loaded walk to
score the winning run for Toronto in the Blue Jays' 2-1 Major
League Baseball victory over the Boston Red Sox here Tuesday.


Matsuzaka was hailed as a superstar after the Red Sox spent 51
million dollars to negotiate with him and 52 million more to sign
him for six years, but he has lost two of his first three
decisions for Boston.


The Red Sox grabbed the lead in the third inning when Wily Mo
Pena smacked a solo home run but the Blue Jays answered off
Matsuzaka in the fourth when Lyle Overbay singled in Vernon Wells
with the tying run.


Matsuzaka walked Aaron Hill to load the bases and then walked
Gregg Zaun to force home Frank Thomas, who had also reached base
on a walk.


Those were the only three walks Matsuzaka issued but together
with two of the only three hits Toronto managed in his six
innikngs on the mound, it was enough to grab the victory.


Matsuzaka struck out 10 Toronto batters, tossing strikes on 68 of
his 105 pitches under the closed retractable dome roof.
