Hong Kong share prices closed flat Wednesday as the market went
into consolidation mode after gaining nearly 450 points in the
last two sessions, dealers said.


They said select China financials and blue chips saw continued
buying interest but it was offset by profit-taking in the
property sector.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 11.52 points at 20,777.09, off a
low of 20,718.72 and a high of 20,868.07. Turnover was 59.81
billion Hong Kong dollars (7.7 billion US).
