Japan's gaffe-prone defence minister triggered more criticism
Wednesday after he said the shooting of Nagasaki's mayor would
benefit an opposition candidate.


Nagasaki Mayor Iccho Ito was shot twice by a gangster Tuesday as
he campaigned for another term in weekend elections.


Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma, speaking before Ito died in a
hospital early Wednesday, said the attack would "lead the
communist candidate to win the race."


Ito, an independent, enjoyed support across the political
spectrum, although a communist and two other independents were
running against him.


"I don't think the comment was appropriate," top government
spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki said of Kyuma.


Opposition party leaders also blasted Kyuma's remarks.


"When many people were praying for the mayor to recover, it was
impolitic of him to make such comments as if he was going to
die," said Japan Communist Party leader Kazuo Shii.


Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the largest opposition Democratic Party,
said: "We have to think beyond the level of partisan politics
about the social issue of people trying to achieve their
objectives through violence."


Kyuma caused a stir earlier this year when he described the US
decision to invade Iraq as "wrong" and warned that Tokyo might
not automatically renew its air force mission to the war-torn
country.


Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet went ahead and extended the
mission by two years last month.


US Vice President Dick Cheney did not meet Kyuma on a visit to
Japan in February.
