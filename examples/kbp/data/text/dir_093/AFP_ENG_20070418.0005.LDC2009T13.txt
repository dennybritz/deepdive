A rare parrot is pining for its perch after being stolen from a
Hong Kong zoo by thieves who stand to make 2,500 dollars selling
it on the black market, a report said Wednesday.


The Military Macaw, named Red, was pinched at the city's Kadoorie
Farm and Botanic Garden on Friday night, the South China Morning
Post said.


The species is on the endangered list and other such birds are
known to fetch 20,000 Hong Kong dollars (2,500 US dollars) on the
black market, the report added.


Farm bosses issued a public appeal for Red's return, saying it
needed special treatment or its health would suffer.


"The bird has the intelligence of a five-year-old. It might
suffer from stress if kept in a small cage and deprived of
attention," a spokeswoman was quoted as saying.


The green-plumed bird was named Red because of a patch over its
beak.


It is flightless and can say a few words in English and
Cantonese, including "hello" and "Daddy".
