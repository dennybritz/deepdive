Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's senior advisor on innovation
called Wednesday for the country's major universities to conduct
more of their lessons in English to entice foreign students.


"At least in leading universities, maybe 20 to 30 percent of the
courses have to be given in English," said Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a
prominent physician who chairs an advisory council to the
Cabinet.


Whether "you like it or not, English is becoming the global
language," he told reporters in Tokyo, noting that universities
in European countries such as France and Germany were already
offering more lessons in English.


Turning out innovative workers in some ways went against Japan's
culture of conformity, said Kurokawa, who was educated in the
United States.


One way of ensuring that Japan continued to innovate would be to
lure more foreign students to enroll in its universities, which
remain relatively closed compared with their North American or
European counterparts, he said.


Kurokawa also suggested that young Japanese should travel abroad
more often on school exchange programmes or homestays to gain an
international perspective.


"If you send many youngsters abroad in different countries, all
of a sudden they begin to realise their identity and their pride
in their own country," he said.


"That's how to nurture your identity and your heritage. When they
come back they want to study Japanese history," he said.
