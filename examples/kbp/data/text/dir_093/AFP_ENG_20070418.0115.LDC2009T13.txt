The number of credit cards in China jumped 22.7 percent in 2006
to nearly 50 million as bank cards become the most popular non-
cash payment instrument for individuals, the central bank said
Wednesday.


Bank cards are now widely used and there is a constant increase
in their usage, the People's Bank of China said in a statement
posted on its website.


Foreign banks like global giants HSBC and Citigroup are competing
for a foothold in China's lucrative credit card market, where
they are currently only allowed to issue co-branded cards with
local partners.


Debit cards still held a dominant position, totaling 1.1 billion,
or 95.6 percent of all bank cards issued as of the end of 2006,
according to the central bank.


Consumer transactions via bank cards rose 97 percent in 2006 to
1.9 trillion yuan (244.8 billion dollars), accounting for 17
percent of the country's retail sales last year, it said, as an
increasingly affluent middle class lead a consumer revolution.
