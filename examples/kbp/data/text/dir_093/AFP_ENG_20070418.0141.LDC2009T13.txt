EU regulators fined Dutch brewers Heineken, Grolsch and Bavaria
274 million euros (372 million dollars) on Wednesday for running
an illegal cartel in the Dutch beer market.


Belgian-Brazilian brewing giant InBev was also named in the case
but was not fined because it had given "decisive information" to
help EU trustbusters break up the cartel.


In the latest action by the European Commission's anti-cartel
campaign, the EU's competition watchdog accused the companies of
fixing prices in the Dutch market during informal meetings
between at least 1996 and 1999.


"It is unacceptable that the major beer suppliers colluded to
hike up prices and carve up the market between themselves,"
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.


"The highest management of these companies knew very well that
their behaviour was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried
to cover their tracks," she added.
