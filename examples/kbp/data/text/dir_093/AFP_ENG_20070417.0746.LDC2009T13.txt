US software giant Microsoft plans to set up a multi-million-
dollar joint research and development centre in Beijing with
China's leading computer maker Lenovo, the Chinese company said
Wednesday.


"The investment involves several million dollars but the specific
figure will vary according to the need of different projects in
the cooperation  between the two," Lenovo spokesman Chen Ji told
AFP.


He said each party will hold 50 percent of the joint research and
development centre.


The state-run China Daily said Wednesday that the facility will
be in Lenovo's existing research base in Beijing, with around 40
engineers from Lenovo and equipment, training and some staff from
Microsoft.


The partners will try to identify opportunities in the consumer
and mobile markets such as digital photography, digital media and
the Internet, the China Daily said, citing Craig Mundie, chief
research and strategy officer at Microsoft.


Lenovo, which has about 30 percent of the market in China, sold
five million computers with Microsoft Windows operating systems
last year, out of its total shipment of eight million units, the
China Daily said.
