Sri Lanka's navy Wednesday found limpet mines attached to the
hull of a cargo ship which docked at the main port of
Trincomalee, officials said.


The vessel, operated by a cement company, was taken away from the
jetty following the discovery of at least two mines, said
officials in Trincomalee, 260 kilometres (160 miles) northeast of
Colombo.


Trincomalee port is in government-held territory but close to the
frontline with the Tamil Tigers' mini-state in the north of the
island.


"As the ship was being unloaded, dock workers noticed two devices
attached to the hull and alerted the navy," a police official
said, adding that both devices, believed to be limpet mines were
removed by naval troops.


The ship had been in the Trincomalee harbour for the past three
days.


The port is also used as the main naval base for operations
against Tamil Tiger guerrillas along the island's northeastern
seaboard.


Tiger rebels last year shelled the port using long-range
artillery.
