US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates arrived in Cairo Wednesday
for talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace
process and weapons sales.


"I'm going to be interested in President Mubarak's views on the
situation in region," said Gates, speaking ahead of departure to
Cairo.


The defence secretary, on a Middle East tour that began on Monday
in Amman, said he will also discuss with the Egyptian leader
events in Iraq, Iran's growing strength in the region and the
situation in Lebanon.


His trip to Egypt was delayed by a day due to the fierce
sandstorm that closed down the Cairo airport for several hours on
Tuesday.


Gates, in the region to rally support for Iraq's government and
counter Iran's growing influence, held talks with King Abdullah
II in Amman on Tuesday.
