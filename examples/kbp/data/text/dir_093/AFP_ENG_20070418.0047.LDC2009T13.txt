China National Chemical Corp launched Wednesday China's first
corporate bond issue based on the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate
or SHIBOR.


The 10-year bonds have a fixed yield of 4.28 percent, the state
run company said in an official notice in the China Securities
Journal.


The yield represents a premium of 1.07 percent on the average of
SHIBOR rates in the five working days preceding the launch.


China National Chemical said proceeds of 1.5 billion yuan will
finance the company's capital investments.


China's corporate debt market, currently under tight government
control, is worth about 36 billion dollars.


Only state companies have real access to the quota driven system.


The launch of the SHIBOR in January was a aimed at developing a
more market- sensitive benchmark for the interbank market,
instead of the central bank's 1-year deposit and lending rates as
the benchmark.


With more flexible interest rates, authorities hope to further
develop the bond market, although bureaucratic rules make
corporate bond issuance in China a long and complex affair.
