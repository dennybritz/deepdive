Eighteen Nigerian opposition parties late Tuesday threatened to
boycott Saturday's presidential and legislative elections if the
April 14 regional polls were not cancelled.


Meeting in the federal capital Abuja, the parties set several
conditions for their participation in the weekend vote, including
"total voiding of the election of April 14th (for governors and
regional parliaments in the country's 36 states), disbanding and
reconstitution of the current Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC), and the postponement of further elections
"until a structure that guarantees transparency and fairness of
the electoral process can be established".


If these conditions are not fulfilled, the 18 parties "shall
consider not participating in the election," the statement said.


It was read at the end of the meeting in the presence of two
leading opposition candidates in the presidential election: Vice
President Atiku Abubakar and General Mohammadu Buhari.


A further meeting was scheduled for Thursday.
