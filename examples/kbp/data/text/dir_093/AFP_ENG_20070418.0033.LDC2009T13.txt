About 450 people, including 135 school students, were
hospitalised in southwest China after a fertiliser plant
discharged a "huge amount" of sulfur dioxide, state media said
Wednesday.


The incident took place early Monday in Guizhou province, the
Beijing Morning Post reported, quoting a local official.


The colourless gas, which can cause respiratory problems,
remained in the air due to heavy fog in the area, the report
said.


Five teachers and some 135 students from two primary schools and
a middle school complained they were having trouble breathing and
were hospitalised, the report said.


More than 300 villagers were later hospitalised in Xifeng county
with similar symptoms and complaints, the paper said.


As of late Tuesday, all of the students were in stable condition.
One villager was in a critical condition and six others were
stable, the paper said.


Local officials were not immediately available for comment.
