European stock markets dropped in opening deals on Wednesday, as
the euro and sterling raced to multi-year highs against the
dollar.


A weak dollar hurts European exporters as their goods become more
expensive for importers paying with the US currency.


London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell 0.21 percent at
6,484.00 points, Frankfurt's DAX 30 dipped 0.10 percent to
7,341.25 points and in Paris the CAC 40 index lost also 0.10
percent to 5,852.47.
