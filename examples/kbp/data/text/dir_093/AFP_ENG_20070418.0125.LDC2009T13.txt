UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday that the
United Nations should establish "shared rules" for handling
hostage crises in war zones.


"To face the hostage problem there should be shared rules, and
the UN is the right place to enact them," Ban said.


It was the first time he had commented on the issue since the
controversial trade of an Italian hostage for five Taliban
prisoners in a crisis that cost the lives of two Afghans.


"I'm happy that (journalist Daniele) Mastrogiacomo was freed, but
... it is not for me to say if what was done was right or wrong,"
Ban told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera in an interview
published Wednesday.


The UN chief, who is visiting Rome on Wednesday, urged UN member
states including Italy to propose such rules to the UN General
Assembly.


Last week Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema called for
international guidelines when he went before parliament to defend
Italy's handling of the Afghan hostage crisis.


"I think the time has come to look at the possibility of
establishing guidelines shared at the international level, common
codes of behavior," D'Alema said.


He said NATO should be involved in particular concerning
Afghanistan, adding that Italy had discussed the issue with NATO
Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.


Ban was to meet D'Alema on Wednesday as well as Italian President
Giorgio Napolitano and Pope Benedict XVI.
