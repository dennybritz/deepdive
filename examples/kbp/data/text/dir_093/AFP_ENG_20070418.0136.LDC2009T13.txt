Japan Tobacco Inc said Wednesday that it had completed its 2.25
-trillion-yen (19.0 billion dollars) acquisition of British rival
Gallaher Group after getting final legal approval.


Japan Tobacco said Gallaher shares would cease trading on the
London Stock Exchange and plans to integrate the smaller rival
were now being drawn up for expected completion in August.


"This acquistion is a significant milestone in the development of
JT's international tobacco business," said Japan Tobacco chief
executive Hiroshi Kimura.


The Japanese tobacco giant said the completion of the deal
followed final court approval in Britain for the takeover, which
is the largest ever by a Japanese company.


Japan Tobacco unveiled plans in mid December to buy Gallaher in a
deal that reinforces its position as the world's third largest
cigarette manufacturer with a global share of 7.4 percent, behind
only Altria and BAT.


EU antitrust regulators approved the purchase in February.


Japan Tobacco sells brands including Mild Seven, Camel and
Winston in about 120 countries and the takeover will give it
extra muscle to take on world number one Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
of the United States.


Gallaher owns Benson and Hedges, Silk Cut, Mayfair and Sovereign
and also makes and sells cigars, "roll-your-own" and "make-your-
own" tobacco, pipe tobacco and "snus", a type of oral snuff used
in Sweden and Norway.
