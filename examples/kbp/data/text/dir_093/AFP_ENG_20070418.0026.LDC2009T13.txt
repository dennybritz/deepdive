A New York-based rights group Wednesday said it had asked the
Pope to use his meeting this week with Sri Lanka's president to
try to end the killing in the South Asian nation.


The Human Rights Watch said it wrote to Pope Benedict XVI
expressing concern over the situation in Sri Lanka where 4,000
people have been killed since an escalation of fighting between
troops and Tamil rebels in December 2005.


"On the occasion of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse's
visit to the Vatican, HRW directed a public letter to Pope
Benedict XVI outlining the organisation's concerns," it said in a
statement.


The HRW also noted that a Roman Catholic priest, Jim Brown, had
vanished in Sri Lanka last year.


"Members of the clergy have been among those targeted," the HRW
said. "We are particularly troubled by the case of Reverend Fr.
Thiruchchelvan Nihal Jim Brown, who 'disappeared' after he was
stopped at a Sri Lanka Navy checkpoint on Kayts Island near
Jaffna on August 20, 2006."


The rights group said the priest had reportedly been receiving
death threats from senior navy personnel.


A headless body found in the area last week is now being
subjected to DNA tests to establish if it is that of the priest.


Sri Lanka's president is due to call on the Pope on Friday.
