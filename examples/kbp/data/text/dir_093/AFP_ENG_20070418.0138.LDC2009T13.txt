Former Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad Wednesday said ex-deputy
Anwar Ibrahim may see limited success in upcoming polls, but
laughed off his chances of winning the vote as a "pipe dream."


Anwar, sacked as deputy prime minister in 1998 on charges of
sodomy -- later overturned -- and corruption, is mounting a
political comeback since being released from jail in 2004.


"He could win a few seats but if it's really making a comeback
and taking over the government, that's a pipe dream," Mahathir
told reporters.


Anwar, Mahathir's former heir apparent, plans to run for
president of the opposition People's Justice Party next month
ahead of expected early general elections.


However, as his corruption conviction still stands, he is barred
from standing for public office until April 2008.


"I think he's still interested in making a comeback and becoming
a prime minister. Next year he will be eligible to contest, he
will contest," said Mahathir.


Malaysia must go to the polls by May 2009 but the opposition is
preparing for an early election, which some members say could
come as soon as October or June.


"I suspect there won't be general elections until the next year,"
said Mahathir.


Human rights groups maintain that allegations against Anwar were
trumped up to prevent him from challenging Mahathir, who retired
in October 2003.


The two men are currently embroiled in a libel lawsuit filed by
Anwar against Mahathir after the former leader said he could not
allow his deputy to become prime minister because he was a
homosexual.
