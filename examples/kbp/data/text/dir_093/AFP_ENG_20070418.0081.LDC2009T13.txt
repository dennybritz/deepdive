At least 32 workers were killed Wednesday and two injured when
they were showered by molten steel at a metal factory in
northeast China, the government said.


It was triggered when a steel ladle, with a capacity to hold 30
tonnes of liquid steel, sheared off from the blast furnace,
spilling molten metal onto the factory floor some three metres
(three yards) below.


The molten steel then engulfed an adjacent room where all the
victims were gathered for a routine change in shifts, the State
Work Safety Administration said in a report.


Rescuers were unable to get closer because of the intense heat
radiated by the liquid metal, it added.


The accident happened early in the day in a workshop of the
Qinghe Special Steel Corporation in Tieling city in Liaoning
province, which is a centre of heavy industry.


It was unclear how many people were working at the time of the
accident, or whether the workers gathered in the room were ending
their shift or coming on to a new shift.


Two machine operators were injured in the accident.


The administration said the factory employed some 300 workers.
Xinhua news agency described it as a relatively new facility,
established in 1987.
