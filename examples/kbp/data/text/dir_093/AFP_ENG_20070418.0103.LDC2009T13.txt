Over 360 Thais have died in road accidents during the kingdom's
seven-day Buddhist New Year holiday with drunk driving causing
nearly 40 percent of accidents, the government said Wednesday.


The traffic death toll hit 361 from April 11 to 17, slightly down
from 375 deaths during the same period last year, the Interior
Ministry said, adding some 4,800 people were injured.


Of 4,274 road accidents, nearly 40 percent were caused by drunk
driving, the ministry said. Motorcycle accidents accounted for
some 85 percent of the total.


Thais are among the world's heaviest drinkers. A health ministry
study has found that per capita, Thais consumed 41.6 litres of
alcohol in 2001, up 67 percent from a decade earlier.


That placed Thailand only behind Portugal, Ireland, the Bahamas
and the Czech Republic, according to the study.
