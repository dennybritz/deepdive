Bangladesh's military-backed government has barred opposition
leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed from returning to the country from
holiday, official sources told AFP Wednesday.


The decision came a day after officials announced the country's
last prime minister, Sheikh Hasina's arch rival Khaleda Zia, was
also being forced into exile as part of a major crackdown on
rampant political corruption.


"The government has taken special security measures regarding
Sheikh Hasina's return to the country," a Home Ministry statement
said.


"All the immigration departments in airports, land ports,
airlines operating flights to Bangladesh and all concerned people
have been informed to take the necessary measures," it said.


Contacted by AFP, two ministry officials confirmed that Sheikh
Hasina would be blocked from entering the country, even though
the statement did not explicitly say so.


Hasina is currently on holiday in the United States but has been
charged in absentia with murder. She had nevertheless vowed to
return to Dhaka next week.
