Sudan's government is using airplanes disguised as United Nations
craft to carry out bombings in the conflict in Darfur, a
newspaper citing a United Nations report said Wednesday.


The confidential UN report also said Sudan was violating UN
Security Council resolutions by flying arms into the region.


The Times' story includes photographs from the UN report of a
Sudanese armed forces plane. UN investigators said it had been
whitewashed and had "UN" stenciled on its wing and bombs laid out
beside it.


It said that this and other planes were being disguised and used
to bomb villages and transport cargo in Darfur, where bloody
civil violence has caused a humanitarian crisis.


More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been killed and at
least two million others displaced in Darfur since 2003. That was
when government forces including its Janjaweed Arab militias
began fighting rebel groups who had taken up arms in protest at
the distribution of resources.


The release of the report came after Sudan on Monday agreed
following months of delays to let 3,000 UN personnel plus
helicopters into Darfur to support under- equipped African Union
forces trying to stabilize the region.


The UN report, released by a diplomat from a Security Council
member nation, said forces on the rebels' side were also guilty
of violating UN resolutions and humanitarian standards. It called
for a tightening of a Security Council arms embargo on Sudan, the
newspaper said.
