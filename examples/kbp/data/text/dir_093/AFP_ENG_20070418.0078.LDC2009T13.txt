The European single currency raced past 1.36 dollars for the
first time since December 2004 in early trading here on
Wednesday.


At about 0715 GMT, the euro stood at 1.3603 dollars.


Speculators are rushing to buy the euro in anticipation of rising
returns on assets in the eurozone, dealers said.


"The difference between the economic performances of Europe and
the US is driving currency trading," said Commerz Bank treasurer
Ryohei Muramatsu.


"Investors are taking advantage of widening interest rate
differentials. While data on the US economy is patchy the
strength of the European economies stands out," he added.


Also on Wednesday, sterling went above 2.01 dollars to reach the
highest point since June 1981.


On Tuesday, unexpectedly strong British inflation data increased
expectations that British interest rates will soon be increased
to contain activity and price rises.


Meanwhile the eurozone, of which Britain is not a member, and
particularly the German economy, is showing unexpectedly strong
growth, despite the strength of the euro which can increase the
price of exports on foreign markets.
