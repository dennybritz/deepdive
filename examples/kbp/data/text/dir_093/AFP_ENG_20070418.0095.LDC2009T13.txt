The family of an Indian professor gunned down in the Virginia
Tech university massacre said Wednesday they would travel to the
United States for his funeral.


The wife and two children of of G.V. Loganathan, a 51-year-old
teacher of civil and environmental engineering, are in Virginia
but his parents and brothers live in the rural town of
Gobichettypalayam in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.


"Initially, we wanted to fly down his body and cremate him in
Gobichettypalayam," Palanivel, one of the two brothers, told AFP.


"But Loganathan had told his wife that if he died in the US, he
would like to be cremated in the Institute's campus where he had
taught for more than 25 years.


The professor was one of 32 students and staff killed on Monday
by Cho Seung- Hui, a 23-year-old student of English.


Palanivel said his late brother was "dedicated to his profession,
the Institute and the students," but did not know whether a
funeral would be allowed on campus.


"It has come as a terrible shock to us. For Loganathan, teaching
was his greatest passion. He turned away much more lucrative jobs
so that he could teach," the brother said.


Officials said the US consulate in Chennai had promised to help
quickly facilitate the family visit.
