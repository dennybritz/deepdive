Demonstrators blockaded Ukraine's constitutional court Wednesday,
briefly preventing judges from entering the building for the
second day of hearings on the political standoff between the
country's president and prime minister.


"They would not let anyone enter. The judges arrived, but cannot
enter," a court spokesman told AFP.


Some officials managed to enter the court by climbing over a high
metal fence that surrounds the building, an AFP correspondent
saw. According to Interfax news agency, two judges got in using a
ladder.


After just over an hour, riot police cleared the protestors out
the way and the court got to work.


The ex-Soviet republic's highest court was deliberating on the
legality of President Viktor Yushchenko's decree two weeks ago
dissolving parliament, which Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych has
refused to accept.


Flag-waving supporters of both Yushchenko and Yanukovych were
among the thousands blocking the entrance.
