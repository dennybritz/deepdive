President Roh Moo-Hyun called an emergency meeting of his aides
on Wednesday as shocked South Koreans came to terms with the news
that the gunman in the US university massacre was a compatriot.


Roh, who said he was "indescribably shocked" at the shooting,
will issue a third statement of sympathy and condolences later
Wednesday, said presidential spokesman Oh Young-Jin.


US police say Cho Seung-Hui, a resident alien and student at
Virginia Tech, carried out the massacre of 32 people before
committing suicide on Monday.


South Korean newspapers carried front-page stories on the tragedy
but the news of his nationality broke too late for there to be
much comment.


"We hope that this tragic incident will not serve as an excuse
for discrimination and prejudice against South Korean and other
Asian people," said Hankyoreh newspaper, the only one to carry an
editorial.


In his earlier statement, Roh urged ethnic Korean communities in
the United States and US citizens to "wisely overcome" the
difficulties created by the tragedy.


Other officials have also expressed concern about a possible
backlash.


Millions of ethnic Koreans live in the United States, Seoul's
closest ally since South Korea came into being in 1948 following
the post-war division of the peninsula.
