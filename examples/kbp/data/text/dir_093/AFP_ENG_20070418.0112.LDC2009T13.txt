A reporter with a government-run radio station was shot dead
Wednesday in the latest attack on journalists in Philippines.


Carmelo Palacios, 41, who worked for the Philippine Broadcasting
Service, was shot in the northern province of Nueva Ecija, a
police report said.


He was the second journalist murdered this year.


Last year 12 media men and women were murdered in the course of
their work, according to the National Union of Journalists in the
Philippines.


Television reports said it was possible Palacios was targetted
because he had criticised corruption in his province.


Geary Barias, head of a police task force looking into extra-
judicial killings, said: "It is too early to make conclusions at
this point in the investigation, neither do we want to speculate
on the possible motive."


The spate of unsolved killings of journalists has made the
country the second most dangerous place for news professionals
after to Iraq, press watchdog groups have said.
