Japanese share prices closed up 0.80 percent Wednesday after the
Dow Jones flirted with an all-time record high overnight
following upbeat earnings news, dealers said.


They said that the gains came despite a slightly stronger yen
against the dollar as well as nervousness ahead the domestic
earnings results season which gets into full swing next week.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
advanced 139.88 points to 17,667.33. The broader Nikkei-225 index
