The UN Security Council on Tuesday voiced concern at reports of
illegal arms movements across the Lebanese-Syrian border and
asked UN chief Ban Ki-moon to send an independent mission to the
area to investigate.


In a statement unanimously adopted by its 15 members and read by
Britain, the council "expresses its serious concern at mounting
information by Israel and another state" of arms smuggling across
the border in violation of UN resolution 1701.


It called on Ban "to dispatch at the earliest, in close liaison
with the Lebanese government, an independent mission to fully
assess the monitoring of the border."


The French-drafted text took note of the Syrian government's
assertion that it has taken measures to prevent the alleged
illegal arms movements and reiterated its call to Damascus to
"take further measures to reinforce controls at the border".


Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 34-day war
between Israel and Hezbollah guerillas in south Lebanon last
August, called for the prevention of illegal arms sales and
smuggling operations in Lebanon and the disarming of all militias
-- a reference to Hezbollah as well as Palestinian militant
groups.


The statement was adopted as Ban left for a four-nation overseas
tour that will take him to Syria next Tuesday after visiting
Italy, Switzerland and Qatar.
