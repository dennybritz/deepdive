The body of missing US Peace Corps worker, Julia Campbell, was
found partially buried in the Philippines, the local army
commander said Wednesday.


The body of Campbell, 40, was found in a shallow grave with her
feet still protruding from the ground in Battad village in the
northern mountainous region of Cordillera, said Major General
Rodolfo Maclang.


Campbell had gone missing while hiking in the area 10 days ago.


Maclang did not disclose the cause of death or any other details.
US embassy personnel said they had heard the reports but were
still trying to confirm the details.
