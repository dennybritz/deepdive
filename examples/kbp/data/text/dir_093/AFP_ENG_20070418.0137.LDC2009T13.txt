Iraqi commanders took charge of security in a fourth province in
the war-torn country on Wednesday, when British forces handed
over responsibility for Maysan at an outdoor ceremony.


"Today the governor of Maysan province and the Iraqi security
forces take on responsibility for the security of its people,"
said Major General Jonathan Shaw, commander of British forces in
Iraq.


Hailing "this important step along the road to Iraqi self-
reliance," he said British-led troops will continue to train
local security forces and patrol Maysan's borders without
impinging on the duties of the provincial government.


"In the event of a crisis situation in Maysan, God forbid that
this should happen, we will retain the capability to intervene,
but only at the behest of the democratic government of Iraq," he
added.


Maysan is the fourth of Iraq's 18 provinces to be handed over to
Iraqi forces and the third transferred by British-led troops.


Last August, British troops handed over security in Amara, the
capital of Maysan, but retained control over other parts of the
province.


Prime Minister Tony Blair told parliament in February that the
number of British troops would likely drop to 5,000 by the end of
the year, compared to about 7,200 currently deployed in the
country.
