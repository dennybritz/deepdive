Celebrity socialite Paris Hilton was on Tuesday ordered to appear
in court next month over a parole violation that could land her
in prison.


After a behind-closed-doors legal conference with prosecution and
defense lawyers in Los Angeles, superior court judge Michael
Sauer said Hilton must attend in person for a hearing on May 4.


The blonde party-loving heiress, who is one of the world's most
photographed women, landed in hot water after she was caught
driving on a suspended licence following a no-contest plea to a
misdemeanor reckless driving charge.


If convicted of violating parole, Hilton could be jailed for up
to 90 days, according to Nick Velasquez of the City Attorney's
Office.
