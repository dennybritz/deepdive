Suspected Islamic rebels shot dead two men in Thailand's restive
Muslim-majority south, including a Buddhist they beheaded, police
said Wednesday.


Militants killed the two Buddhists, aged 51 and 50, in an ambush
late Tuesday in Narathiwat, one of three insurgency-torn southern
provinces bordering Malaysia.


They then beheaded the 50-year-old man early Wednesday, police
said.


Also in Narathiwat, at least five bombs hit power transmission
stations late Tuesday, but the attacks caused no power blackout
and there were no reports of casualties.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in the violence-torn
provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani since the separatist
insurgency broke out in January 2004.


Violence has escalated in the past six months despite moves by
the military- backed government to bring peace to the troubled
region.
