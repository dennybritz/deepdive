Chinese share prices rose sharply Monday, adding 3.53 percent for
another record finish driven by continued strong fund inflows and
solid overseas markets, dealers said.


Banks, power generators and steelmakers were snapped up, they
said, adding that the influx of new money would continue push
shares even higher as concerns the government will take action to
slow the runaway economy appeared all but forgotten.


Some 110 companies closed up by their daily 10 percent limits.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, jumped 126.68
points to a record 3,710.89 on turnover of 183.17 billion yuan
(23.70 billion US dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 133.12 points or 3.53 percent
at 3,899.95 on turnover of 182.10 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index added 41.14 points or 3.91 percent at a record
1,093.30, on turnover of 102.54 billion yuan.
