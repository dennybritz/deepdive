Hong Kong share prices finished the Monday morning session off
their highs as a sharp drop in China Mobile trimmed early gains
driven by Wall Street's record close on Friday, dealers said.


They said that some investors also locked in profits ahead of the
settlement of April futures contracts on Friday.


China Mobile slumped after announcing lower-than-expected margins
of earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortization for the first quarter.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 30.04 points or 0.15
percent at 20,596.63, off a high of 20,757.41 and a low of
20,586.78.
