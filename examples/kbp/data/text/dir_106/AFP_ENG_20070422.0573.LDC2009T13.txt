Right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy obtained 31.11 percent of votes in
round one of France's presidential election, ahead of Socialist
Segolene Royal on 25.84 percent, final interior ministry results
showed Monday.


The top two contenders in Sunday's first round, the 52-year-old
Sarkozy, the candidate of the governing UMP party, and Royal, who
is 53, will face off in a divider on May 6.


Centrist candidate Francois Bayrou came a distant third on 18.55
percent, while the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was fourth
on 10.51 percent. None of the other candidates gained more than
five percent, according to the interior ministry.


Olivier Besancenot (Trotskyite) won 4.11 percent, Communist
leader Marie-George Buffet 1.94 percent, Green party candidate
Dominique Voynet 1.57 percent, Arlette Laguiller (Trotskyite)
1.34 percent, anti-globalisation campaigner Jose Bove 1.32
percent and Gerard Schivardi (Trotskyite) 0.34 percent.


The Catholic nationalist Philippe de Villiers won 2.24 percent,
and Frederic Nihous, candidate of the hunters' party, secured
1.15 percent.


The figures do not include the ballots of about 820,000 French
voters overseas which will be published later in the day.


Turnout stood at 84.6 percent.


France is picking a successor to the 74-year-old Jacques Chirac,
who has been president since 1995, in an election that has become
the focus of vibrant debate about the country's future.
