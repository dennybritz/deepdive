Texas Rangers closing pitcher Eric Gagne, best by injuries for
more than two seasons, left Sunday's game with an apparent hip
injury.


Gagne entered the game in the ninth inning of the series finale
with Oakland, but walked off the mound after just two pitches.
Akinori Otsuka recorded the final two outs for the save.


"Gagne has a right hip sprain," Rangers manager Ron Washington
said. "He's day- to-day, but it is not a back problem. It is
always a concern when you see your closer act up on the mound."


The 2003 NL Cy Young Award winner has been ravaged by a litany of
injuries over his career to his shoulder, elbow and back,
pitching in only 16 games over the last two seasons.


The righthander is 0-0 with a 0.00 ERA in four appearances this
season.


"It's frustrating," Gagne said. "As long it's not my arm or my
back, I'm not really worried. It's something I can deal with."


The major league record holder with 84 consecutive converted
saves from August 28, 2002-July 3, 2004, Gagne has recorded 161
lifetime saves - including a career-high 55 in 2003, when he
posted a 1.20 ERA in 77 games.
