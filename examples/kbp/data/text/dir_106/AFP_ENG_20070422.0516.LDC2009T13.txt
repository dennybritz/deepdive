Vania King, substituting for an injured Serena Williams, rallied
to beat Kirsten Flipkens 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 and clinch a US victory
over Belgium in a Fed Cup World Group first round tie here
Sunday.


Williams was pulled from the match with an inflamed right knee
but King gained the deciding point to send the Americans into a
semi-final tie against Russia in July. France and Italy will meet
in the other semi-final.


Reigning Australian Open champion Williams, a seven-time Grand
Slam singles winner, and elder sister Venus Williams each won
singles matches Saturday to give the US women a 2-0 edge in the
best-of-five matchup.


Venus Williams beat Flipkens 7-5, 6-2 and Serena Williams downed
Caroline Maes 6-1, 6-4. King captured the third match in two
hours and 38 minutes.


Sunday's scheduled later dead rubbers were to send Venus Williams
against Maes and Tamaryn Hendler and Yanina Wickmayer against
King and Lisa Raymond.
