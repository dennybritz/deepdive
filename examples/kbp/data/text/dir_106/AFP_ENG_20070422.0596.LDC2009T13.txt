Textbooks depicting men only as breadwinners and women as
housewives are set to disappear from schools in the South Korean
capital Seoul under new gender equality rules, reports said
Monday.


The city's education office has released guidelines for all
schools meaning they must discard textbooks which show
stereotyped gender roles such as male doctors and female nurses,
the Korea Times and Korea Herald reported.


History curriculums will put more focus on women's achievements.


The education office will also recommend that schools change
rules barring girls from wearing trousers to school.


Korea has traditionally been a male-dominated society. The US
State Department's 2006 human rights report said "traditional
attitudes limited opportunities for women" and gender
discrimination in the workplace remained a problem.


But it noted that "social mores and attitudes were improving
gradually."
