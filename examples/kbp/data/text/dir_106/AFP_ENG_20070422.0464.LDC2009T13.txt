Seven of the top 10 batsmen in the latest ICC rankings are from
teams involved in this week's World Cup semi-finals.


Of the top 10 only Kevin Pietersen, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Mahendra
Singh Dhoni will not be in Jamaica or St Lucia on Tuesday and
Wednesday for the penultimate stage of the competition.


Sri Lanka opener Sanath Jayasuriya has moved up to third
following his run of good form while there have also been moves
in the right direction for Sarwan of the West Indies, AB de
Villiers and Herschelle Gibbs of South Africa and Australians
Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke.


Hayden has moved up one place to seventh spot and is enjoying his
highest rating for nearly three years following his third century
of the World Cup against New Zealand on Friday.


England's Pietersen is still on top spot, closely followed by
Australia captain Ricky Ponting in second. Sarwan's good showing
in the Super Eight stage of the tournament has propelled him up
no fewer than 10 places to sixth.


In the bowling rankings, South Africa's Shaun Pollock is still in
front but he is slowly being caught by Shane Bond and the latest
Australian fast bowler to make a challenge, Nathan Bracken.


The 29-year-old New South Welshman has moved past his team-mate
Glenn McGrath and now occupies third spot.


Another Australian to have an excellent tournament so far is Brad
Hogg.


He has moved up nine places to 14th and 19 places since the World
Cup began. Hogg's teammate Shaun Tait is also in impressive form,
having moved up 66 places since the start of the tournament, into
the top 50 for the first time.
