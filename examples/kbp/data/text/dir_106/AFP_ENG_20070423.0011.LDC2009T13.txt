Hong Kong share prices closed the Monday morning session off
their highs as a sharp drop in China Mobile trimmed early gains
driven by Wall Street's record finish on Friday, dealers said.


They said some investors also locked in profit ahead of the
settlement of April futures contracts on Friday.


China Mobile slumped after its first quarter results.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 30.04 points or 0.15
percent at 20,596.63, off a high of 20,757.41 and low of
20,586.78. Turnover was 29.89 billion dollars ((3.83 billion US).


China Mobile was down 1.85 dollars or 2.47 percent at 73.05
dollars.
