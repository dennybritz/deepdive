LeBron James scored 23 points, grabbed nine rebounds and made
seven assists here Sunday to lead Cleveland past Washington 97-82
in a National Basketball Association playoff opener.


The Cavaliers, second seeds for the first time in 31 years,
grabbed the edge in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference matchup
as they try to eliminate the Wizards for the second year in a
row.


Antawn Jamison had game highs of 28 points and 14 rebounds for
the Wizards while Larry Hughes led the Cavaliers with 27 points.


"We needed it. I was the guy who needed to give us a life and I
came through," Hughes said. "Any time, I'm ready. I'm prepared to
step up and do what I did. We just wanted to stay patient, run
our things."


Hughes hit a 3-pointer at the half-time buzzer to give Cleveland
a 48-41 lead at the break.


"That was definitely a big play for us," James said.


The Wizards have the chance to level the series here Wednesday.


"We have to be ready," Hughes said. "It's only one game."
