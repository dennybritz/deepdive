Taiwan has agreed to be included in the Olympic torch relay for
the 2008 Games, a senior official in charge of preparing the
Beijing Games said Monday.


"Taiwan will be included," Wang Wei, the vice president of the
Beijing organising committee, told reporters in Beijing.


"You all know that this is a very sensitive matter and needs
discussion and I will not go into details. But according to the
previous discussion between the two sides, a tentative decision
has been made," Wang said.
