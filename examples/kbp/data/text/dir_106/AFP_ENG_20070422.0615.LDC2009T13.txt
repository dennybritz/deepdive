Taiwan has agreed to be included in the Olympic torch relay next
year, a senior Chinese official in charge of preparing the 2008
Beijing Games said Monday.


"Taiwan will be included," Wang Wei, the vice president of the
Beijing organising committee, told reporters.


"You all know that this is a very sensitive matter and needs
discussion and I will not go into details. But according to the
previous discussion between the two sides, a tentative decision
has been made," Wang said.


He said the route of the torch relay would be announced on
Thursday, and said the ambitious plan would include carrying the
flame over Mount Everest.


But the planned leg through Taiwan, Beijing's long-time
diplomatic foe, has proven the most controversial.


Authorities on the island are reportedly reluctant to be included
on Beijing's terms, under which Taiwan would be considered part
of the circuit within mainland China.


Beijing considers Taiwan a part of its territory awaiting
reunification, by force if necessary.
