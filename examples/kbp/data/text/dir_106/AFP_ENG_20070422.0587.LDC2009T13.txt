Champion Australian weightlifter Aleksan Karapetyan was Monday
suspended for two years after he admitted taking a banned drug,
the national sports anti-doping authority said.


The Armenian-born champ admitted taking benzylpiperazine (BZP)
following an investigaton by US anti-doping crusader Richard
Young, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority said (ASADA).


Karapetyan, who won gold in the 94-kilogram division at the
Commonwealth Games in 2006, is the fifth Australian weightlifter
to be suspended for using BZP.


The Australian anti-doping body called on Young to investigate
the sport in March after four weightlifters, including Athens
2004 Olympian Sergo Chakhoyan, tested positive for the stimulant.


ASADA chairman Richard Ings said Karapetyan's case was complex as
the ban was based on non-analytical evidence and the illegal
substance was taken during an overseas competition, the Mermet
Cup in the United States in 2005.


"ASADA has been successful in detecting a serious doping
violation by this athlete at a major US weightlifting competition
that would otherwise have been undetected," he said.


Karapetyan's results in the Mermet Cup have been disqualified but
all subsequent results until March 2006 remain official, Ings
said.


Karapetyan, 36, joins Chakhoyan, Corran Hocking, Jenna Myers and
Camilla Fogagnolo, who have all been suspended for using BZP.
Three other weightlifters are awaiting rulings.


Chakhoyan's case was one of the triggers for an intensive ASADA
investigation, which revealed an organised drug ring was at work
within Australian weightlifting.
