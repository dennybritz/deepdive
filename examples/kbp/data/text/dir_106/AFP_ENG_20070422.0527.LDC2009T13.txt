Barry Bonds hit his 740th career home run here Sunday as he
continued his pursuit of Hank Aaron's all-time Major League
Baseball record of 755 homers.


Bonds belted a solo homer to right field with two out in the
fourth inning off Arizona starter Yusmeiro Petit, giving San
Francisco a 2-0 edge en route to a 2-1 victory.


The 42-year-old slugger hit his sixth homer of the season and now
needs 16 to break Aaron's all-time mark of 755. At his current
pace, the 42-year-old Bonds would break the record sometime in
mid-June.


San Francisco improved to 9-8 for the season and completed a
sweep of the Diamondbacks in a three-game series.


Bonds had provided the lone run in Saturday's 1-0 win with home
run No. 739.


Bonds's heroics have been tainted by accusations of steroids
although he has denied any wrongdoing and never tested posititve.


But Bonds's trainer, Greg Anderson, was among five men convicted
in the BALCO steroid scandal and for much of Bonds's career,
Major League Baseball did not test for performance-enhancing
drugs.
