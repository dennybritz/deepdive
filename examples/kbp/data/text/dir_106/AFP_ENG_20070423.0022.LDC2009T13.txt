Six Vietnamese men, including three members of one family, died
one by one as they followed each other into a well to fix a
broken pump and were apparently poisoned by some kind of gas.


The men died in the six-metre (20 foot) well in the city of
Pleiku on Sunday, said Huynh Van Hung, a local commune official.


"A neighbour, then the neighbour's son, then four others climbed
into the well to check what happened," he told AFP. "They died
one by one, probably because they inhaled some kind of poisonous
gas."


The six victims were aged 23 to 47. Two of the eight men who
climbed down the well were rescued and in a serious condition in
hospital.
