Suspected separatist insurgents killed and attempted to behead a
Buddhist man on Monday, while 17 soldiers were injured in attacks
in Thailand's troubled south, police said.


The 40-year-old Buddhist was shot dead by suspected Islamic
rebels as he drove his motorcycle in Yala province. His neck was
deeply slashed in an apparent attempt to behead him, police said.


Rebels also staged four separate attacks in one district in
Narathiwat province Sunday evening.


Within two hours of a school being set on fire, insurgents
injured 17 soldiers in three ambushes and bomb attacks across the
district.


More than 2,100 people -- both Muslim and Buddhist -- have been
killed in the Muslim-majority provinces of Narathiwat, Yala and
Pattani since the latest separatist insurgency erupted in January
2004.
