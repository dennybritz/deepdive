The memorial stone is piled with flowers and an American flag
like all 32 others, but the name on it provokes a wince: Cho
Seung-Hui, the man who unleashed the country's worst-ever
shooting rampage on the university campus here.


The stone to South Korea-born, US-raised Cho is, for no special
reason, number 30 in the 33 arranged in a semicircle in a
makeshift memorial at the center of Virginia Tech.


Letters, photographs, bouquets, stuffed animals and other
mementos have accumulated along with candles at each, and Sunday
a line more than 100-people long snaked down onto the drillfield
as students, family and alumni sought to pay their respects to
those Cho shot to death on April 16 in campus buildings nearby,
before killing himself.


Many stopped long at Cho's stone to ponder his gruesome act and
read the letters of forgiveness and sympathy for his family.


"Seung Hui, I hope that if I ever meet someone like you, I will
have the courage and strength to reach out," said one signed
David.


"We forgive you because we've been forgiven," offered a Christian
who signed only MEQ.


"To the family of Cho Seung-Hui: We know that you are hurting
too," said another.


But one letter to Cho, who left behind angry, hateful and violent
pictures and statements that were shown on television after the
massacre, was more defiant:


"Cho: you greatly underestimated our strength, courage and
compassion. You may have broken our heats but you have not broken
our spirits," wrote a person who only signed "Erin T."
