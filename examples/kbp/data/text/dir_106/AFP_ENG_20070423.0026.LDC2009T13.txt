Indian space scientists were counting down the final hours Monday
before a home- built rocket launches an Italian satellite into
space in the country's first commercial space mission.


The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is scheduled to blast
off at 3:30 pm (1000 GMT) from Sriharikota spaceport, 80
kilometres (50 miles) north of Chennai in southern India, space
agency officials said.


"The countdown, which involves a series of precisely timed
operations, is going on," a spokesman for the Bangalore-based
Indian Space Research Organisation said. "The PSLV has been mated
with its payload and the fully integrated vehicle is standing on
the launchpad."


The 15-storey-high rocket is being pumped with liquid propellant
and undergoing pre-launch tests, said the spokesman.


It will launch the 352-kilogram (774-pound) Italian astronomical
satellite Agile that will be used to gather information about the
origins of the universe.


"The payload will be separated from the vehicle in its orbit 23
minutes after the takeoff," the spokesman said.


The 48-hour countdown began on Saturday, setting the stage for a
launch that India hopes will win it membership of an exclusive
club of nations to successfully put their space programmes to
commercial use.


India wants to compete with the United States, Russia, China, the
Ukraine and the European Space Agency in offering commercial
satellite launch services, a market worth up to 2.5 billion
dollars a year.
