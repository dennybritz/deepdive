Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo has completed the first
half of an expected double award triumph on Sunday night when he
was named PFA Young Player of the Year.


The 22-year-old Portugal winger, who is also favourite to win the
Player of the Year accolade later Sunday, beat off competition
from second-placed Cesc Fabregas of Arsenal and Tottenham's Aaron
Lennon, who was third, to claim the honour, voted by the members
of the Professional Footballers' Association, the players union.


Ronaldo has recovered from the controversy of last summer's World
Cup to enjoy his best ever season as United battle for a
sensational treble going into the final weeks of the campaign.
