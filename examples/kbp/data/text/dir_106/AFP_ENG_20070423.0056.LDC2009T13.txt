The latest round of talks between Iran's top nuclear negotiator
Ali Larijani and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on
Wednesday will take place in Turkey, the semi official Fars news
agency said.


The agency, which quoted an "informed official", said that latest
attempt to break the deadlock over the Iranian nuclear programme
was taking place in Turkey following work by Prime Minister Recep
Tayyip Erdogan.


"Erdogan has been in talks with head of the national security
council (Larijani) and the EU foreign policy chief and agreed
that the new round of talks on Wednesday will be held in Turkey,"
the agency said.


The location has yet to be officially disclosed.


The pair, who held several rounds of discussions last year which
failed to find a solution to the crisis, last met face-to-face
for informal talks on the sidelines of the Munich security
conference on February 11.
