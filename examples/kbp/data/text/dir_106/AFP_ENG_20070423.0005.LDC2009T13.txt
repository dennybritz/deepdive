An English tourist who crashed a camper van, killing his friend
and injuring six people, was fined in a New Zealand court Monday.


David MacCallum, 23, of Gloucestershire was fined 3,000 dollars
(2,240 US) and disqualified from driving for 12 months.


He was driving the camper van on Good Friday when it collided
with a four-wheel- drive near the South Island city of Blenheim,
killing Adam Birdsey, one of four friends travelling with him.


The three others in the camper van were injured, along with three
members of a New Zealand family travelling in the other vehicle,
which burst into flames. The family had to be pulled from their
vehicle by passers-by.


MacCallum pleaded guilty to careless driving causing death and
six counts of careless driving causing injury on April 6. He had
failed to see a stop sign at an intersection.
