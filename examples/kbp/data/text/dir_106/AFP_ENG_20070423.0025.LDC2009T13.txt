Traffic accidents worldwide claim 1.2 million lives a year and
injure millions more, the World Health Organisation said in a
report released Monday.


Every day 1,000 people under the age of 25 are killed in traffic
accidents, with 90 percent of these deaths occurring in low to
middle-income countries mainly in Africa and Asia, it said.


The report said traffic accidents were the biggest killer of
young people between the ages of 15 and 19, far higher than
HIV/AIDS.


Many of the young pepople killed are pedestrians, cyclists,
motorcyclists or passengers on cheap public transport.


In Asia, where the motorcycle is often the family vehicle,
helmets are rarely used, partly because of their cost and the
lack of helmets for children, the WHO said.


"Young motorcyclists make up a significant percentage of injuries
and fatalities among road users in many Asian countries.


Factors such as speed, no helmets, risk-taking behavior and
drunk-driving contribute to the rising trend," it said.


WHO said that by wearing helmets correctly, the risk of death is
cut by some 40 percent and the risk of severe injury by 72
percent.


In many low-income countries, laws enforcing the wearing of
protective helmets are rarely enforced.


The report said mllions more are injured and often remained
disabled for life.


In high-income countries, most of those killed or injured in road
accidents are drivers of four-wheeled vehicles.


The agency proposed "simple measures" that can be enforced to
minimise injuries and deaths from road accidents.


These include setting and enforcing appropriate speed limits and
drink driving laws, child restraint laws and the mandatory use of
seat belts and helmets.
