US-based Citigroup and Britain's HSBC were among a group of banks
that started providing local-currency retail services in China
Monday after receiving the final green light, state media said.


The group, which also included Britain's Standard Chartered and
Hong Kong's Bank of East Asia, began operations after passing an
audit by local regulators last week, the China Daily reported.


While the four banks will now in principle have access to the
country's two trillion dollars of domestic household savings, the
lenders are likely to mainly target China's wealthier customers,
the newspaper said.


At the same time, domestic lenders, trying to fend off
competition in the retail market, are also stepping up their
efforts to court higher-end customers with services such as
private banking, it said.


Beijing agreed to open up the tightly held industry when it
became a World Trade Organization member in 2001.


The regulations require foreign lenders to set up locally
incorporated banks if they want unrestricted ability to carry out
yuan currency transactions.
