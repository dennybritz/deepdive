Sri Lanka will persist with out-of-form opener Upul Tharanga for
the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, the country's chief
selector said on Monday.


The left-hander's poor form -- he has scored just 17 runs in his
past three innings -- raised speculation that former skipper
Marvan Atapattu could replace him at Jamaica's Sabina Park on
Tuesday.


But Asantha de Mel, the chairman of Sri Lankan selectors, said
Tharanga's good deeds far outweighed his recent failures and he
deserved to stay in the team.


"We must not forget that Tharanga scored two centuries against
England last year and also scored two centuries in the Champions
Trophy," de Mel said just before leaving for the Carribean on
Monday.


"In this World Cup also he was the highest scorer with 65 against
India."


De Mel, who opened the bowling in Sri Lanka's inaugural Test
match in 1982, said it was difficult to fit the seasoned Atapattu
into the batting order.


"There is no room for him at number five since Chamara Silva has
secured that place by playing so well."


De Mel said he had spoken with the team management and they
agreed that Tharanga should not be axed.


Atapattu could miss out on a World Cup game in the Caribbean
despite being in the squad, just as he did in the 1996 edition in
the Indian subcontinent, which Sri Lanka won.


Atapattu is Sri Lanka's third-highest run getter in one-day
international cricket with 8,529 runs from 268 games and 11
centuries.
