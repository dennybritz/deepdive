Brian Gionta scored two goals and the New Jersey Devils advanced
to the second round of the National Hockey League playoffs with a
3-2 triumph over Tampa Bay here Sunday.


The second-seeded Devils, who defeated the Lightning four games
to two in the best-of-seven series, will face Ottawa in the
second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs while top seed
Buffalo will meet the New York Rangers.


Gionta scored the opening goal on a power play 14:29 into the
first period and the Devils doubled the margin on Brian
Rafalski's power-play goal 81 seconds into the second period.


Brad Richards answered for Tampa Bay just 5:10 into the second
period but Gionta stretched New Jersey's lead to 3-1 just 39
seconds later with his fifth goal of the playoffs.


Richards added a power play goal 5:03 later to pull the Lightning
back within a goal, but Tampa Bay could never slide the equalizer
past Devils netminder Martin Brodeur, who made 32 saves.


The Stanley Cup playoffs were to continue later Sunday with
Detroit trying to advance with a victory at Calgary, the Red
Wings leading the Western Conference series 3-2.


Anaheim and San Jose have already advanced in the West with
Dallas playing at Vancouver on Monday in the seventh game of
their series.
