The Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Novartis, on Monday announced an
11 percent increase in first quarter net profit to 2.17 billion
dollars (1.59 billion euros), exceeding analysts' expectations.


Net sales in the first three months of 2007 grew by 18 percent
compared to the same period last year, reaching 9.82 billion
dollars, Novartis said in a statement.


Financial analysts told Thomson Financial News that they had been
expecting a net profit figure around the 1.82 billion dollar
mark.


"I am confident of another year of record sales and earnings in
2007," chairman and chief executive Daniel Vasella said.


Novartis reiterated its prediction of sales growth reaching above
five percent for the full year.


The group had revised its 2007 sales outlook downwards last month
following the suspension of the anti-constipation drug Zelnorm --
one of its best selling products in the United States -- by US
authorities due to fears of cardiovascular problems among some
patients.


The outlook takes into account a predicted cut in net sales of
600 million dollars due to the regulatory suspension, it added.


Approvals of several new drugs "that meet unmet medical needs"
were expected to help overcome some of the losses, Novartis said.
