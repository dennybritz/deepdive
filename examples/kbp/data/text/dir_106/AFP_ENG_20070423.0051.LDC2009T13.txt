Three suspected Islamic militants and a soldier were killed in
gunbattles in Indian Kashmir, police said Monday, as three rebels
were reported to have died in an avalanche.


Two militants were killed in a gunbattle with troops and police
in southern Pulwama district late Sunday, a police spokesman
said.


A soldier and a militant died in a separate battle in northern
Kupwara district, bordering Pakistan-administered Kashmir, he
said.


Kashmir is split between India and Pakistan, which both claim it
in full. They have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir
since independence from Britain in 1947.


Meanwhile, police said they recovered the bodies of three
militants from the region's most powerful group -- the pro-
Pakistan Hizbul Mujahedin -- who were buried in an avalanche.


The scenic Himalayan region is in the grip of a nearly 18-year
insurgency against Indian rule that has left more than 42,000
people dead by official count. Rights groups put the toll at
70,000.
