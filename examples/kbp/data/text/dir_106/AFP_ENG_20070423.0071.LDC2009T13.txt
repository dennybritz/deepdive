EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana confirmed here Monday that
he will meet with Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani in
Turkey on Wednesday.


Iran on Sunday rejected Western calls for a suspension of its
sensitive nuclear activities just days ahead of the crucial talks
on its atomic drive.


"I will be meeting Larijani on Wednesday in Turkey," Solana told
reporters in Luxembourg ahead of an European Union foreign
ministers meeting, adding that the talks would be held in Ankara.


Solana and larijani held several rounds of discussions last year
which failed to find a solution to the crisis. They last met
face-to-face for informal talks on the sidelines of the Munich
security conference on February 11.


It remains to be seen what result can come out of the new
meeting, given Iran's insistence on enriching uranium and the EU
position that Tehran must freeze the process before full
negotiations can begin.
