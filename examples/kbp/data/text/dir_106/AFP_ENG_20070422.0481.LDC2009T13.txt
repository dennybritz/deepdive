The bodies of three people previously listed as missing after a
strong earthquake hit Chilean Patagonia were found Sunday,
officials said.


"Rescue teams found that three persons had died," said Jose
Abumohor, of the National Emergencies Office.


Seven others remained among the missing after the 6.2 quake hit
southern Chile, 45 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of Coihaique
on Saturday, at 1750 GMT.


President Michelle Bachelet and Interior Minister Belisario
Velasco arrived at midday to supervise the rescue efforts.


Meanwhile, on Sunday, seismologists at the University of Chile
measured a 5.6 temblor at 1022 GMT, which struck near the port
city of Valparaiso, some 120 kilometers (100 miles) west of
Santiago. No damage or injuries were immediately reported.


The quakes were measured on the Moment Magnitude scale, which
measures the area of the fault that ruptured and the total energy
released.


Police, army, navy and air force units searched the area around
the fjord of Aysen, 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) south of
Santiago for the seven missing.


Chile's patagonia has suffered intense seismic activity of more
than 100 temblors this year, experts said, the result of an ocean
floor volcano. Saturday's quake was the strongest this year.


Saturday's quake unleashed six-meter (20-foot) waves, which
seismologists did not qualify as a tsunami.


It opened cracks in the soil, and triggered rock slides and power
and water service outages.
