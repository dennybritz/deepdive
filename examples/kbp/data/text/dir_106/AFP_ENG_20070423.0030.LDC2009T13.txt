South Korean police said Monday they have  arrested five people
for forcing hundreds of desperate job-seekers, including cancer
patients and the disabled, into virtual slavery in the fishing
industry.


The five, who operated an illegal employment agency in the
southern port city of Busan, were arrested last week. Three more
suspects are being sought.


They are accused of recruiting 443 people by putting false
advertisements in community papers promising jobs and a monthly
wage of up to four million won (4,255 dollars), police said.


"Those picked by the illegal employment agency have been coerced
to work like slaves at isolated fish farms or on fishing boats on
remote islands since 2005," Lee In-Seok, a Busan maritime police
spokesman, told AFP.


"The victims included cancer patients, the homeless and even four
mentally retarded men," he said.


The human smuggling ring earned a total of one billion won in
commissions and prepaid wages from the owners of fish farms and
fishing boats.


The victims included a 25-year-old mentally retarded man who was
"sold" to a fishing boat after visiting the agency.


The agency bought drinks for the man, made him have a sex with a
prostitute and then told him he had incurred a debt of five
million won.


"We are expanding the investigation to determine if Kim's agency
has been linked to illegal employment agencies in other areas,"
Lee said.


The case reflects a serious manpower shortage in the country's
fishing industry, he said.
