Brazil's Leandro Barbosa scored 26 points and Amare Stoudemire
added 23 points here Sunday to lead Phoenix past the Los Angeles
Lakers 95-87 in a National Basketball Association playoff opener.


Kobe Bryant scored 39 points in another superb one-man show for
the Lakers, but the teamwork of the Suns was too much to
overcome.


Canadian guard Steve Nash had 20 points and 10 assists for the
Suns, who also had 16 points and 16 rebounds from Shawn Marion
and 12 rebounds from Stoudemire.


Barbosa hit 10-of-22 shots from the field


"I did a great job in the second half," Barbosa said. "I had a
lot of energy to do that. I got tired a little bit. But this is
the playoffs. If you get tired you have to push yourself. I think
that this is really good for me."


Lamar Odom added 17 points and 16 points for the Lakers, who will
try to level the series here Tuesday.
