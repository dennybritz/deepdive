Football legend Diego Maradona on Sunday marked his first day in
a mental health unit where he is fighting alcoholism, his
physician said.


Maradona, 46, was hospitalized last week suffering from
hepatitis-related pain, but entered a psychiatric clinic in
Buenos Aires for extended rehab, said his personal physician,
Alfredo Cahe.


"Diego has become aware of the seriousness of his situation,"
Cahe told Uno radio earlier. "From now on, the main treatment
will focus on his addiction to alcohol."


Now, "Maradona's treatment (for alcohol abuse) should last the
rest of his life," Cahe added.


Maradona was earlier treated at the Clinica de los Arcos, where
officials said the former player's health continued to improve.


The ex-Argentina World Cup captain and Barcelona star was rushed
to the clinic complaining of severe abdominal pain, just two days
after being discharged from a different clinic where he had
undergone two weeks of treatment for illness caused by excessive
drinking.


Maradona's career on and off the football pitch has been marred
by repeated drug and alcohol abuse. He was hospitalized in 2000
and 2004 for heart attacks provoked by cocaine overdoses.
