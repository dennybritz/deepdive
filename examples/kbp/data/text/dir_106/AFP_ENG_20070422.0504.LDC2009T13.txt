President Hugo Chavez warned against attempts to destabilize
Venezuela over the expiry of a private television license, which
he said Sunday will not be renewed.


"Anybody who goes around thinking they can pressure me through
international organizations, other governments or a diabolical
court or marches, they are not going to pressure me on May 27 the
day the concession is going to end," Chavez said on his radio and
television program, "Hello, Mr President."


"The plotters have done no wrong; they can still change their
minds.


"The ministers of defense, interior and justice, governors and
mayors will each prepare their counter-attacks.


"If we are attacked, all well and good, but the counter-attack
will be crushing," he said.


Chavez said last year that his government will not renew the
license for RCTV which expires after 20 years in May 2007.


He has accused the channel of backing a 2002 coup, in which he
was removed from power for two days, and of broadcasting
pornography.


Thousands of persons marched on Saturday through Caracas to the
stations of RCTV to protest his decision not to renew the
license.


Political opponents say the decision violates freedom of the
press.
