Japanese share prices climbed 0.94 percent in morning trade
Monday, lifted by another record high on Wall Street Friday and
hopes of upbeat domestic earnings news, dealers said.


They said exporters got a boost from a softer yen, which helped
to steady nerves ahead of Japan's corporate results season which
gets into full swing this week.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 164.89 points to 17,617.51 by the lunch break.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares advanced
11.62 points or 0.68 percent to 1,721.69.
