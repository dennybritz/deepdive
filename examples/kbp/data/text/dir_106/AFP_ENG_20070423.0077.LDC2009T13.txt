A landslide killed nine workers when it rumbled through a
construction site in the brittle loess hills of northern China
with one more still missing, state media reported on Monday.


The accident occurred Sunday in an area of Shanxi province where
excessive coal mining has severely weakened the ground, causing
large cracks in the earth, the China News Service said.


Of 13 people originally buried in the landslide, nine bodies had
been unearthed since Sunday evening, it said.


Rescue efforts were still underway on Monday to try to dig out
the last missing worker at the scene in Banpo village, it said.


It gave no information on the fate of the other three workers
originally buried.


However, the Beijing Times newspaper reported that one had been
taken to hospital with serious injuries.


The landslide also buried about one third of an adjacent village
committee headquarters, the paper said.


Coal mining activity is so close to the village that explosions
from dynamite used by miners can be heard from above ground. Long
cracks in the earth as wide as five centimetres (two inches)
criss-cross the village, the Beijing Times said.
