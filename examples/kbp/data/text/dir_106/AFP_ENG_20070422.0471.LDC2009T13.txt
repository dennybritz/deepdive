Ireland have been rewarded for their memorable World Cup debut by
being confirmed as the 10th best team in the world.


In Group D in the first round in the Caribbean, Ireland beat
Pakistan and tied with Zimbabwe at Sabina Park, earning them a
place in the Super Eights. During that stage Ireland beat another
Test team, Bangladesh, along the way.


"This really is a magnificent achievement by the Irish guys,"
said ICC Global Development Manager Matthew Kennedy.


"It shows that they have certainly worked hard, risen to the
occasion, and made the very most of and learnt from their
increased opportunities.


"It proves that serious cricketing achievement is possible from
within this next tier of nations. Depth and sustainability, and
continued opportunity and support, is obviously the key and that
is what we will continue to strive for."


Ireland also has ODI status until 2009, a status also enjoyed by
the top six Associate Members, the others being Kenya, Scotland,
the Netherlands, Canada and Bermuda.


Ireland's promotion to 10th place has knocked Zimbabwe down into
11th.
