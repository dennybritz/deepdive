Japanese share prices ended little changed on Monday as a
stronger yen unsettled nervous investors ahead of the domestic
corporate results season, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
closed up 2.75 points or 0.02 percent at 17,455.37 after giving
back most of its early gains.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares dipped 4.44
points or 0.26 percent to 1,705.63.
