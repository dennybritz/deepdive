Two teenage Australian girls who killed themselves in an apparent
suicide pact had posted depressed notes on Internet sites
including MySpace in the months before their deaths.


Jodie Gater and her friend Stephanie Gestier, both 16, were found
hanging from a tree in a national park near Melbourne on Sunday.
They had been missing for a week before their bodies were found.


Gater had written several items mentioning suicide on one of her
websites between December and February, including a poem called
'Suicide in the Night'.


"It's over for me, I can't take it! I hear it over and over
again, It feels like it always rains," it reads.


In one MySpace entry she wrote: "Let Steph n me b free."


Her final MySpace update was on April 14, one day before she and
Gestier went missing, and was addressed to her boyfriend Allan.


"I luv you sooo soo much Allan, Miss u heaps and heaps xoxoxo I
will always remember u," she wrote.


Gestier had also posted a disturbing entry on a website in the
weeks before she died, saying: "i dont wanna know how many
friends you have cuz i dont have any anymore."


Friends of the girls also turned to MySpace to express their
grief as the news of their deaths spread, and local media
reported Gestier's mother had posted a message in the early hours
of Monday morning.


"Stephanie, why didn't you tell me you were so upset? Why didn't
you just come home?" the letter reads.


"You had only just turned 16. You were always such a quiet girl
who spent time listening to music and surfing the Internet.


"There is nothing that couldn't have been sorted out. You were my
only child and can never be replaced. Bye bye, my little girl."


Experts said joint suicides by girls were extremely rare.


"It's very, very unusual to have girls kill themselves and
particularly kill themselves in this way," said psychologist Dr
Michael Carr-Greg.
