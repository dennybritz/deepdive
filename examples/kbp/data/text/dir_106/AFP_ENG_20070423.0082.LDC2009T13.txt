A car bomb near the offices of a Kurdish political party in a
mainly Christian village of northern Iraq killed at least 10
people and wounded 20 on Monday, an official with the party told
AFP.


The explosion occurred near the office of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party in the village of Tal Isquf, north of the
restive city of Mosul, said party spokesman Abdul Gani Ali.


Witnesses told AFP by telephone that a car loaded with explosives
exploded between the party offices and a social club in the
village, 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Mosul.


They said some of the victims were thought to be Kurdish
peshmerga fighters.
