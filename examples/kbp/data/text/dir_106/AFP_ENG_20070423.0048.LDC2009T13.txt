Arch-rivals Sydney FC and the Central Coast Mariners will kick
off the A-League season on August 24 while newly-formed
Wellington Phoenix face a baptism of fire against title-holders
Melbourne.


The draw for the Australian league's third season, released
Monday, also pits Queensland Roar against grand-finalist Adelaide
United while Perth Glory take on the Newcastle Jets.


A four-week finals series will commence on January 25 with the
grand final on February 17.


Football Federation Australia chief executive Ben Buckley said
the season would consolidate the A-League's success over the last
two years.


"The second season of the Hyundai A-League was a terrific success
and we have a great base now to build upon next season," said
Buckley.


"We have two seasons of experience behind us and with the support
of the clubs and the venues we have developed a very competitive
draw."


A number of modifications have been put in place.


The salary cap has been increased by 200,000 Australian dollars
(166,000 US) to 1.8 million dollars to allow for expanded squad
sizes.


Clubs meanwhile must have between 20 and 23 players in their
squad with a maximum of four foreign players. They must also
contain at least two goalkeepers and a minimum of three under-20
players.
