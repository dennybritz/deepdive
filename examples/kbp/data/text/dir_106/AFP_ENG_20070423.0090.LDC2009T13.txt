Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca on Monday said it
has agreed to buy US biotechnology company MedImmune for 15.6
billion dollars (11.5 billion euros) in total.


"AstraZeneca today announced that it has entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire MedImmune Inc. in an all-cash
transaction," the group said in a statement to the London Stock
Exchange.


"Under the terms of the agreement, which has unanimous MedImmune
Board support, AstraZeneca will acquire all of the ... shares of
MedImmune common stock at a price of 58 dollars per share, for a
total consideration of approximately 15.6 billion dollars."


MedImmune is based in Maryland in the eastern United States and
specialises in vaccines.


AstraZeneca, the third-biggest European drugs maker behind
GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis, revealed that the deal was
expected to complete in June 2007.


Cost savings from the acquisition were expected to be towards 500
million dollars per year by 2009, the group added.
