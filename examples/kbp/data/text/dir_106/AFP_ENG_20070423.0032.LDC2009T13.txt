Dutch bank ABN Amro and Britain's Barclays announced Monday they
plan to merge, creating Europe's second largest bank and the
fifth worldwide.


The new company will have 220,000 employees and 47 million
customers.


ABN Amro management has been under pressure from shareholder TCI,
a hedge fund, to discuss takeover terms with the other groups
interested in buying the lender.


The Dutch bank had been set to meet Monday with the Royal Bank of
Scotland, Spain's Banco Santander and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis
regarding a possible separate offer.


It is thought that the three banks, which would be able to cut
more costs than Barclays, would divide up ABN assets between
them.
