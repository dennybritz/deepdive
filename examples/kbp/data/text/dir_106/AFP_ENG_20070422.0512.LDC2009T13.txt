Barry Bonds hit his 740th career home run here Sunday as he
continued his pursuit of Hank Aaron's all-time Major League
Baseball record of 755 homers.


Bonds belted a solo homer to right field with two out in the
fourth inning off Arizona starter Yusmeiro Petit, giving the San
Francisco Giants a 2-0 edge.


The 42-year-old slugger is now 16 home runs shy of surpassing
Aaron's all-time mark of 755.


San Francisco are 8-8 for the season and seeking to complete a
sweep of their three-game weekend series against the 10-9
Diamondbacks.


Bonds had provided the lone run in Saturday's 1-0 win with home
run No. 739.


Bonds's heroics have been tainted by accusations of steroids
although he has denied any wrongdoing and never tested posititve.


But Bonds's trainer, Greg Anderson, was among five men convicted
in the BALCO steroid scandal and for much of Bonds's career,
Major League Baseball did not test for performance-enhancing
drugs.
