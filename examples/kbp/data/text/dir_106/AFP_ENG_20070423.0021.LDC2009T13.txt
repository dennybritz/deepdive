Malaysia is hunting down more than 20,000 foreign nationals who
have entered the country as tourists before staying on to find
jobs illegally, reports said Monday.


The visa-on-arrival scheme was introduced last year ahead of a
major campaign aimed at boosting overseas visitor numbers but
Home Minister Radzi Sheikh Ahmad said it is being abused.


"We simplified the entry process for foreign tourists... but some
people had abused the visa to stay in the country longer than the
duration allowed," Radzi was quoted as saying by the state
Bernama news agency.


The minister said tourists were using the one-month visa to work
illegally, and that most over-stayers are from China and India,
with a small number from African nations, the New Straits Times
reported.


"They are lured because we are a prosperous nation. Many have
entered the country and obtained the VOA, but they never left,"
Radzi was quoted as saying.


He said immigration officials, police and a volunteer force are
conducting daily raids to find the over-stayers, who are
deported.


Despite the visa abuse, Radzi said the government will not scrap
the scheme, citing its importance for tourist arrivals.


Malaysia hopes to attract 20.1 million tourists in 2007, up from
17.5 million in 2006, and to draw in receipts of some 44.5
billion ringgit (13.00 billion dollars).


Tourism is Malaysia's second-largest foreign exchange earner but
it is facing stiff competition from neighbours including
Singapore and Thailand.
