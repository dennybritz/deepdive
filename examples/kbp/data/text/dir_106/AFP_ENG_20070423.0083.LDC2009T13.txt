An Indian state has ordered the wardens of a national wildlife
park to shoot poachers of endangered one-horned rhinos on sight,
officials said Monday.


"A massive anti-poaching operation has been launched with orders
issued to shoot-on-sight any unauthorised person inside
Kaziranga's premises," Rockybul Hussain, northeastern Assam
state's forest minister, told AFP in the reserve.


Six rhinos have been killed by poachers in the 430-square-
kilometre (166-square- mile) Kaziranga park since January,
including two in the past 10 days.


Hussain said he had deployed 50 rangers and 30 soldiers for anti-
poaching operations in Kaziranga, home to an estimated 1,855
rhinos.


Experts believe the rhino's horns, which are purportedly an
aphrodisiac, are smuggled to China or sold in other clandestine
Asian markets.


Buyers from the Middle East also use the horns to make ornamental
dagger handles. Estimates suggest the horns can sell for up to
35,000 dollars per kilogramme (2.2 pounds).


Five rhinos were poached last year and seven were killed in 2005.


About 500 rhinos have been killed by poachers over the past 20
years, according to government estimates.


Kaziranga lies some 220 kilometres (158 miles) east of Assam's
largest city of Guwahati.


India's western state of Gujarat is also battling poachers. It
stepped up security in its Gir forest reserves last week
following the mysterious deaths of around a dozen rare Asiatic
lions.
