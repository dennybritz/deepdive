Singapore is buying four converted executive jets equipped with
early warning systems to beef up its air defences, the Ministry
of Defence said Monday.


The converted Gulfstream 550 aircraft will replace planes which
have been in service for 20 years.


The upgrade is part of the country's new Networked Air Defence
capability plan, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean said in a speech
after watching a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF)
demonstration.


"Equipped with a better radar and modern information systems, the
Gulfstream 550 will significantly enhance the RSAF's airborne
early warning and surveillance capability," said Teo.


The planes, which are also used by the Israeli air force, are
manufactured by Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, a wholly owned
subsidiary of US firm General Dynamics.


Singapore, which has one of Asia's most modern armed forces, has
increased its defence budget by 5.3 percent to an estimated 10.58
billion dollars (7.0 billion US) in the 2007 fiscal year.


Teo said last year that high defence spending was an "insurance
policy" against potential aggressors.
