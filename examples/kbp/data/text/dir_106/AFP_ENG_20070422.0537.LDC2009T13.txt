Nick Watney shrugged off two early bogeys to post a three-under
69 and claim the first US PGA Tour win of his career Sunday at
the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.


Watney recovered from his early woes with an eagle at the fifth
hole, going on to finish with a 15-under total of 273 - three
shots in front of Ken Duke.


Watney, who led by two strokes going into the final round of the
6.1 million- dollar event, lost the advantage after 10 holes
before regrouping with birdies at 11 and 14 to win comfortably.


Watney's previous best finish was a fifth-place tie last season
at both the Reno-Tahoe Open and the FUNAI Classic.


Duke, who also was seeking his first tour title, carded four
birdies over the first eight holes and grabbed a one-shot lead at
14-under when Watney bogeyed the 10th.


The 38-year-old Duke, whose best PGA finish is a ninth-place tie,
could not register another birdie and fell off the pace with
bogeys at 14 and 18.


Anthony Kim had the day's best round, a 65, and finished tied for
third with John Mallinger at 11-under 277.


Second-round leader Mark Calcavecchia managed just a 71 and was
another shot back at 278 with Bubba Watson and Chris Stroud.


After being moved last year due to the devastation caused by
Hurricane Katrina, the event returned to the TPC Louisiana, a
course that plays 7,341 yards.


Nearly 2,000 trees were lost due to the storm and a number of
holes were completely under water, and it took more than a year
to refurbish the Pete Dye- designed course.
