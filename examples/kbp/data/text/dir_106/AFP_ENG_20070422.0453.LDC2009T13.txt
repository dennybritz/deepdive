An Israeli civilian was moderately hurt on Sunday when a
Palestinian opened fire on a car in occupied east Jerusalem,
police said.


"A Palestinian standing at the Hizma junction fired towards a
driving car, wounding the driver, who was rushed to hospital with
moderate wounds," a police spokeswoman told AFP.


Police were searching the area with the help of a helicopter for
the assailant, who fled towards the Shuafat refugee camp north of
the site of the shooting.
