A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a restaurant near
Baghdad's fortified Green Zone on Monday, killing two people and
wounding 10, a security official said.


The bomb attack took place outside the Al-Yasmin restaurant in
Baghdad's central Karrada district, near the Green Zone which
houses the Iraqi parliament and the US embassy.
