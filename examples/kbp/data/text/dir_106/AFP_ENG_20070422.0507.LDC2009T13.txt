President Alan Garcia on Sunday headed for Washington for talks
on trade and potential relocation of a US military base to Peru,
in a White House meeting with US President George W. Bush.


"I believe that a free-trade deal finally will become an
important step for Peru," Garcia told journalists at Lima's
international airport before boarding a commercial airliner with
Foreign Minister Jose Garcia Belaunde for his second meeting with
Bush on Monday at the White House.


The trade agreement was ratified by Peru's Congress in April
2006, but the US Congress has not yet voted on the treaty.


Bush's Republicans no longer control the US Congress,
complicating passage as Democrats have said they would like to
see labor and environmental protections added to the deal.


Also on Garcia's agenda for the 48-hour visit is the possibility
of moving to Peru a US base from neighboring Ecuador. The lease
expires soon and President Rafael Correa said will not be
renewed.


Garcia said he also plans to meet Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
