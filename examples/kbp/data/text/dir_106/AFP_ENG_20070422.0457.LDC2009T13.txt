Deirdre Mitchell created history Sunday by becoming the first
woman to referee a South    African Premiership football match.


She took control of a national championship fixture between
Santos and Kaizer Chiefs, which was moved from Cape Town to
Telkom Park in this south-eastern city to draw a larger crowd.


Mitchell smiled continuously during a fast-pace match and did not
shirk her responsibilities, cautioning five players, including
former South Africa and Charlton Athletic striker Shaun Bartlett.


Santos won 3-1 to leave Chiefs ninth on the standings with three
rounds left and facing the humiliation of not qualifying for a
pre-season competition among the top eight league finishers.
