Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said Sunday that he had
ordered a halt to a controverisal wall being built by US troops
around a Sunni enclave in mainly Shiite east Baghdad.


"I am opposed to the building of the wall and its construction is
going to stop," the premier told a joint press conference in
Cairo with Arab League chief Amr Mussa.


Since April 10, US paratroopers have been deploying at night
around the Sunni enclave of Adhamiyah to erect a five-kilometre
(three-mile) wall made of six- tonne (14,000-pound) concrete
sections.


The wall is designed to prevent Shiite death squads from
launching attacks to drive out the Sunnis from the district, and
to prevent Sunni insurgents from using the pocket as a base for
raids into Shiite areas.


Earlier Sunday, US commanders announced plans to extend the
scheme to other restive neighbourhoods of the capital.


But Iraqi politicians have accused the US military of hardening
the city's already bitter sectarian divisions.


"Erecting a wall around Adhamiyah is the height of failure and a
bad, faulty step that violates human rights," said leading
Kurdish MP Mahmud Othman.


"It's an obvious sign that the policy of US and our government
has failed to keep security."
