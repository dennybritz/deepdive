The Israeli army dropped fliers in northern Gaza Strip on Monday
threatening an incursion unless rocket fire stops within 48
hours, witnesses said.


Israeli helicopters dropped the fliers, written in Arabic, in the
north of the coastal strip, they said.


The Israeli army said it was unable to confirm the reports.


On Saturday, the army killed a militant in an air raid in Gaza
after a rocket fired from the territory lightly wounded two
Israelis in the southern town of Sderot.


Another eight Palestinians, including two teenagers, were killed
by troops in the occupied West Bank on Saturday and Sunday -- the
bloodiest weekend of Israeli-Palestinian violence since a
November 26 truce between the army and militants in Gaza.


Under the terms of the truce, the army withdrew troops from Gaza
and militants there were to stop firing rockets into Israel.
Despite violations by both sides, the truce has largely held.
