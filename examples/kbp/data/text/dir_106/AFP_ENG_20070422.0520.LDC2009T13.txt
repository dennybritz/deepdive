Japanese international midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura capped off a
perfect day Sunday as the Celtic star was voted Player of the
Year by the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association.


The 28-year-old beat off strong competition from team-mates Lee
Naylor and Artur Boruc, as well as Aberdeen skipper Russell
Anderson, to pick up the prize at a ceremony in Glasgow.


The award came just hours after Celtic clinched the Premier
League title following his superb last-gasp winner at Kilmarnock,
earning the Hoops a 2-1 win.


"I'm very pleased but this isn't something you can get on your
own - it's down to the whole team and also the supporters," said
the modest Nakamura.


"All the players deserved to get this award. For example, a
player like Neil Lennon is not really in the limelight but he is
so important in the background and without players like him we
wouldn't have our style of play."


Nakamura also won Goal of the Season for his cheeky lob against
Dundee United on Boxing Day, which earned Celtic a 2-2 draw.


"I remember we were 2-1 down at the time and it was a very hard
game," he said. "I'm pleased to get the award but every goal is
the same to me, they are all important."


There were more celebrations in the Celtic camp when Gordon
Strachan was named Manager of the Year.


But there was to be no clean-sweep for Celtic, with Aiden McGeady
beaten to the Young Player of the Year by Kilmarnock's Steven
Naismith.
