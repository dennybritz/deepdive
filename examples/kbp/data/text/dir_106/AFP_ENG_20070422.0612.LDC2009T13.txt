Snuppy, the world's first cloned dog, will be mated later this
year with the world's second canine clone known as Bona,
researchers said Monday.


"The mating may take place late this year when the female dog
called Bona grows up," Kim Min-Kyu at Seoul National University
(SNU) told AFP.


Snuppy will celebrate his second birthday on Tuesday while Bona
was born on June 18 last year. They are Afghan hounds.


"Both Snuppy and Bona are healthy. The mating is aimed at
learning about their reproductive capacity," said Kim, who was
part of the team which created both dogs.


Snuppy was created under the stewardship of now-disgraced cloning
expert Hwang Woo-Suk. So far, the team has cloned one male and
three female Afghan hounds.


Hwang was hailed as a national hero in South Korea until a
university inquiry ruled that some of his work on cloning
embryonic human stem cells was fake.


He is now on trial for fraud, embezzlement, ethical breaches and
other charges but has insisted he can still prove he created the
first cloned human stem cells.


The work of his team in creating Snuppy has been verified by SNU
and other authorities.


Snuppy (Seoul National University puppy) is leading a healthy
life, Kim told the Korea Times.


"Snuppy eats well and sleeps soundly. He really enjoys playing
with people or taking a walk inside (the) university," he said.
