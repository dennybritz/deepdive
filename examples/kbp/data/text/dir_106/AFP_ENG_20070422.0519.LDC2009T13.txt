Slovenia's Janez Brajkovic captured the Tour of Georgia here
Sunday, keeping his overall lead through the seventh and final
stage that was won by Argentina's Juan Jose Haedo.


Discovery Channel rider Brajkovic won with a total time of 25hrs
26mins 33secs to defeat American Christian Van de Velde by 12
seconds with Spain's David Canada Gracia third, 3:04 off the pace
and two seconds ahead of Swiss rider Rubens Bertogliati.


The last stage of the event was a 107.5km circuit race around the
state capital city that went to Team CSC standout Haedo.


The South American star edged Freddy Rodriguez at the finish just
one day after the US racer edged Haedo at the line to take stage
six.


Haedo's winning time was 2hrs 25mins 30secs, the same as
Rodriguez, third place Sergey Lagutin of Uzbekistan, fourth place
Cuban Ivan Dominguez and fifth place George Hincapie of the
United States.
