Deposed Thai prime minister and football fan Thaksin Shinawatra,
who once tried to purchase Liverpool, may be considering buying
another English Premier League team, his lawyer hinted Monday.


Noppadol Pattama would not confirm local press reports that the
billionaire Thaksin, in exile in Britain since his September
ouster, would try to buy a stake in Manchester City.


But he said Thaksin was considering a stake in an English club.


"He is looking to do some business, and it is possible that he
will buy a team because he loves football," Noppadol said. "But I
cannot confirm or deny it yet. It will be more clear in the next
few weeks."


Local media reported that Thaksin had already bought Manchester
City, currently languishing at the bottom of the premiership, for
six million baht (184 million dollars) with the help of investors
in China and the Middle East.


Thai-language papers said that Fulham owner Mohammad Al Fayed, a
friend of Thaksin, had also helped with the purchase.


But Noppadol denied that Thaksin had bought any team yet.


In 2004, Thaksin led a Thai consortium that tried to purchase a
30 percent stake in Liverpool, angering fans who wanted to keep
the team in British hands.


The bid eventually fell through, though Liverpool now has
American owners.
