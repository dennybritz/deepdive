Calgary Flames goaltender Jamie McLennan was suspended for five
games by the National Hockey League here Sunday while the club
and coach Jim Playfair were each fined from a playoff loss to
Detroit.


The incidents happened late in Saturday's 5-1 Western Conference
first-round defeat at Detroit and resulted in a fine of 25,000
dollars for Playfair and 100,000 dollars for the organization.


McLennan was ejected after only 18 seconds on the ice after
slashing Detroit's Johan Franzen with three minutes to play in
the game. Four penalties in all were whistled on the Flames for
aggressive stickwork.


"In our pre-playoff conference calls with the coaches and general
managers, we addressed a number of topics and one of them was
actions late in the game when the score was out of hand," said
NHL vice president Colin Campbell.


"The coach and the organization must be held accountable for the
players' actions."


McLennan, a reserve, began his five-game suspension with Sunday's
sixth game of the series. The ban would extend into the second
round of the playoffs if the Flames advance or next season if
they are eliminated.
