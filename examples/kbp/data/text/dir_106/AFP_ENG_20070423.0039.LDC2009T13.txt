The US military said Monday it will re-assess measures to secure
Baghdad after Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered it to stop
building a concrete wall around a dangerous Sunni enclave.


"We are aware of what the press has reported that the prime
minister said," US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel
Christopher Garver said in an email to AFP.


"The government of Iraq and multinational forces in Iraq do agree
that we need to protect the people of Iraq," he added.


"How that is done is always being discussed and we will continue
that dialogue. We will coordinate with the Iraqi government and
Iraqi commanders in order to establish effective, appropriate
security measures."


Maliki told a press conference in Cairo on Sunday that he was
against walling in Baghdad's Adhamiyah district.


"I am opposed to the building of the wall and its construction is
going to stop," he said.


Since April 10, US paratroopers have been deploying at night
around Adhamiyah, located in mainly Shiite east Baghdad, to erect
a five-kilometre (three-mile) wall made of six-tonne
(14,000-pound) concrete sections.


The wall was designed to prevent Shiite death squads from
launching attacks to drive out the Sunnis from the district, and
to prevent Sunni insurgents from using the pocket as a base for
raids into Shiite areas.


Angry residents and lawmakers too have expressed strong
opposition to the wall, saying it hardened the already bitter
divide between the two communities.


US commanders on Sunday had announced plans to construct similar
walls in other restive neighbourhoods of the capital.
