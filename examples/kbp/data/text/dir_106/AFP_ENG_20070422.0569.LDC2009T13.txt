Right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy obtained 31.11 percent of votes in
round one of France's presidential election, ahead of Socialist
Segolene Royal on 25.84 percent, final interior ministry results
showed Monday.


The top two contenders in Sunday's first round, the 52-year-old
Sarkozy, the candidate of the governing UMP party, and Royal, who
is 53, will face off in a divider on May 6.
