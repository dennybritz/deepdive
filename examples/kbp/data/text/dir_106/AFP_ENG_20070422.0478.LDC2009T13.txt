Socialist Segolene Royal called Sunday for voters to rally round
her for the presidential runoff on May 6, promising to bring
France change without upheaval.


"I call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform
France without brutalising it, who want a triumph of human values
over the stockmarket, who want an end to the painful rise of
insecurity and precariousness, to come together," she told a
rally in central-western France.


"Many of us -- regardless of the first round -- do not want a
France ruled by the law of the strongest or the most brutal,
sewn-up by money interests, where all powers are concentrated in
the same few hands."


"I reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but
urgent to break with a system that is no longer working," Royal
said.
