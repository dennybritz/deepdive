Twenty-four people were killed and seven injured when a bus
plunged off an overpass in southwest China on Monday, state press
reported.


The accident occurred in morning rush hour when the bus fell more
than 20 metres (66 feet) off an overpass in Chongqing, Xinhua
news agency reported. Five of the injured were in a critical
condition.


Police are trying to determine how many people were on the bus at
the time of the accident.


China's roads are some of the most dangerous in the world. More
than 18,000 people were killed and more than 90,000 injured in
road accidents in the first quarter of 2007, according to
official figures.


In 2006, around 245 people died on the roads every day. The World
Health Organisation says the real number could be twice that.
