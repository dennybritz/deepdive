A Swiss man was jailed for 10 years Thursday on charges of
insulting Thailand's revered king by vandalising his portraits
during a drunken spree.


Oliver Jufer, 57, had pleaded guilty to five counts of lese
majeste -- the crime of offending the dignity of a sovereign --
for defacing several portraits of the king with spray paint in
the northern city of Chiang Mai.


He had faced up to 75 years in prison, but the court sentenced
him to 20 years and then halved the term because Jufer had
confessed.


"The court has punished him for insulting the king. This is a
serious crime, and he was sentenced to four years for each of
five counts, for a total of 20 years," judge Pitsanu Tanbuakli
said.


"Because he confessed, the court has reduced his sentence to 10
years," he said.


Jufer's court-appointed lawyer did not attend the sentencing, and
Jufer said nothing as he entered or left the court. Prosecutors
declined to comment on the case due to the sensitivities of
speaking about Thailand's king.
