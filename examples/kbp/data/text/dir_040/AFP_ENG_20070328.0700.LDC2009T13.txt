A new era for France began with a 1-0 friendly win over Austria
here on Wednesday with Zinedine Zidane's replacement Samir Nasri
and fellow debutant Karim Benzema hogging the spotlight.


Benzema's 54th minute goal came as Raymond Domenech's men were
finally able to break through Austria's dogged defence at the
Stade de France.


The 19-year-old Marseille player Nasri, fielded just behind the
brand new strike pairing of Djibril Cisse and Nicolas Anelka, had
a standing ovation when he left the pitch with 20 minutes to go
which augurs well for France who might have been expecting to
greatly miss the now-retired Zidane.


As expected Domenech had shuffled the side compared to the one
which earned a 1-0 victory in Lithuania on Saturday night in a
Euro 2008 qualifier.


Lassana Diarra, Rio Mavuba and Abou Diaby formed an untried
midfield trio in front of a defence of Francois Clerc, skipper
Lilian Thuram, plus Philippe Mexes and Julien Escude.


Apart from generally impressing the home fans, Nasri was also
involved in the goal as it was his freekick which set up Lyon
centre forward Benzema nine minutes after the break.


In Wednesday's l'Equipe, Nasri had been disappointed about the
parallels with Zidane. "The comparison with Zidane needs to
stop," he said. "Zidane is Zidane. There aren't any others."


However parallels with Zidane do exist. Both are from Marseille,
they have the same agent in Alain Migliascio, and Zidane himself
has never hid his admiration for the player almost exactly 15
years his junior.
