Carlos Alberto Parreira and South Africa were brought back down
to earth with a bang when they lost a friendly 1-0 at home to
unfancied Bolivia on Wednesday.


The Bolivians, ranked 101 in the world, came to Johannesburg
having not won an away game since 1996, but Joselito Vaca's
deflected strike was enough to end that drought.


Foremr Brazil coach Parreira chose to start the game with the
same XI that had played so admirably in beating Chad 3-0 in an
African Nations Cup qualifier in N'Djamena on Saturday.


On the back of that result, many expected this game to be a walk
in the park for Parreira's men.


But Bafana and their supporters were stunned after just 19
minutes when Vaca's shot deflected off midfielder MacBeth Sibaya
into the back of the net.


The 2010 World Cup hosts had much of the play for the rest of the
first half, and came close when Surprise Moriri headed Lucas
Thwala's cross just over the bar.


Moriri then thought he had scored in first half injury time,
firing home from the edge of the area, but Botswanan referee
Tebogo Ramocha had already blown the half time whistle, much to
the consternation of the Bafana players.


Parreira made four substitutions at half time, and one of those
who came on, Benedict Vilakazi, tested Bolivian goalkeeper Sergio
Galarza with a couple of long range efforts.


Another substitute, Elrio Van Heerden, was then inches away with
a curling shot that shaved the outside of the post. Siyabonga
Nomvethe, yet another sub, then wasted two more glorious
opportunities, but it was not to be Bafana's night.


For Parreira, there is clearly plenty of work still to be done.
