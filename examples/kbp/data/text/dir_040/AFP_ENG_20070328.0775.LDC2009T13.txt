Major European telecommunications companies could be forced to
separate their networks and their services, the EU telecoms
commissioner said in an interview published Thursday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, Viviane Reding said that the
"functional separation" of services from networks had benefitted
various European markets such as Britain, leading to more
competition and faster adoption of other services.


"The functional separation is a very interesting remedy for the
access problems in this market," she said.


"Increased competition is driving lower prices."


The separation would allow telecoms groups to retain their own
networks, but would mean the companies would have to create
separate management structures to placate national regulators.


According to the FT, Reding indicated that the European
Commission may introduce "functional separation" as a possible
solution for competition issues at its review of telecoms rules
in July.
