Britain's Andy Murray advanced to the semi-finals of the 6.9
million-dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt tournament
here Wednesday when US third seed Andy Roddick retired.


Murray led 5-3 after 29 minutes when Roddick pulled out with a
left hamstring injury. He had taken treatment before the final
game in an ultimately vain attempt to continue.


As a result, the 19-year-old Scotsman who ranks 12th in the
world, advanced to a semi-final matchup against the winner of a
later quarter-final between Spanish second seed Rafael Nadal and
Serbian Novak Djokovic.


It will be the fifth semi-final of the year for Murray, who won
at San Jose and lost in the Doha finals as well as the semi-
finals at Indian Wells and Memphis, where he lost to Roddick.


Swiss world number one and top seed Roger Federer was ousted
Tuesday by Argentina's Guillermo Canas.


The injury is another setback for 24-year-old Roddick, who has a
21-4 record in 2007 and has reached four semi-finals this year -
including the Australian Open - but has yet to claim a title.


On the women's side, Israeli teen Shahar Peer advanced to the
semi-finals with a 6-0, 6-3 victory over Italy's Tathiana Garbin.


Peer, ranked 16th, will play for a spot in the championship match
against the winner of a later quarter-final between Australian
Open champion Serena Williams and Czech eighth seed Nicole
Vaidisova.


The other semi-final will match world number one Justine Henin of
Belgium and Russia's Anna Chakvetadze.


Peer, 19, took just 80 minutes to dispatch Garbin, winning the
first nine games of the match on the way to her third semi-final
of the year.
