South Africa were 186-5 after 40 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights clash against Sri Lanka at Providence here on Wednesday
chasing 210 to win.


Jacques Kallis was on 78 with Shaun Pollock on 1.


Opener AB de Villiers was the first man out bowled by Chaminda
Vaas for 0 in the first over.


But captain Graeme Smith then cut loose making 59 from 69 balls
with seven fours and one six before he was stumped by Kumar
Sangakkara in the 18th over off the bowling of Muttiah
Muralitharan.


The spinner then rocked South Africa by capturing two wickets in
two balls to dismiss Herschelle Gibbs caught and bowled for 31 in
the 33rd over with the score at 160.


Muralitharan then had Mark Boucher lbw the next ball but Justin
Kemp kept out the hat-trick ball.


Kemp didn't last much longer, however, when he was stumped by
Sangakkara off Sanath Jayasuriya for 5 in the 38th over.


Earlier, Charl Langeveldt claimed five wickets as Sri Lanka
limped to 209 all out.


Tillekeratne Dilshan (58) and Russel Arnold (50) were mainly
responsible for Sri Lanka's total, putting on 97 for the sixth
wicket after their side slumped to 98 for five.


South Africa, needing a win to get their campaign back on track
after losing against Australia in St Kitts Saturday, brought in
left-arm spin bowler Robin Peterson in place of batsman Ashwell
Prince.


Seam bowler Farveez Maharoof returned for Sri Lanka in place of
Dilhara Fernando.


Sri Lanka already have two Super Eight points following a win
over fellow group qualifiers Bangladesh.
