Britain has not yet had direct confirmation from the Iranian
government that they will be allowed consular access to 15 naval
personnel being held by Tehran, a foreign ministry spokesman told
AFP Thursday.


Responding to press reports that Iran will grant British
officials access to the group, the spokesman said: "We await
further details from the Iranian government on their undertaking
to act on our request for consular access to the Royal Navy
personnel."


"We continue to press strongly for their immediate release."


Iran has held 14 men and one woman at an undisclosed location
since Friday when they were seized because Tehran says they
entered its territorial waters illegally.


Britain insists the group were on a "routine" anti-smuggling
operation inside Iraqi waters when they were seized at gunpoint
in the northern Gulf.


The crisis prompted British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett to
announce Wednesday a freeze to all dealings with Iran apart from
contacts to resolve the standoff that began on Friday with Iran's
seizure of the 15 naval personnel in the Gulf.


Iran drew fresh condemnation from Britain later Wednesday by
parading some of the captive service personnel on state
television.


The sole woman among them, 26-year-old Faye Turney, was shown
admitting that she and her comrades had strayed into Iranian
waters but the circumstances of the recording of the footage were
unclear.
