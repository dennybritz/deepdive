Serbian teenager Novak Djokovic upset second-seeded Spaniard
Rafael Nadal 6-3, 6-4 here Wednesday to reach the semi-finals of
the 6.9 million-dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt
tournament.


Djokovic, 19 and seeded 10th, avenged his loss to Nadal in the
final of the Masters Series tournament in Indian Wells,
California, two weeks ago. In the semi-finals he'll face
Scotland's Andy Murray, who advanced earlier Wednesday when
American Andy Roddick retired injured.


Nadal, meanwhile, followed world No. 1 and top seed Roger Federer
of Switzerland out of the tournament.
