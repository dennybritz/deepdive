Serbian teenager Novak Djokovic upset second-seeded Spaniard
Rafael Nadal 6-3, 6-4 here Wednesday to reach the semi-finals of
the 6.9 million-dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt
tournament.


Djokovic, 19 and seeded 10th, avenged his loss to Nadal in the
final of the Masters Series tournament in Indian Wells,
California, earlier this month with his first win over the
Spaniard in three meetings.


He fought off three break points in the final game before closing
out the match with an ace after 1hr 37min.


In the semi-finals he'll face Scotland's Andy Murray, who
advanced earlier Wednesday when American Andy Roddick retired
injured.


Nadal, meanwhile, followed world No. 1 and top seed Roger Federer
of Switzerland out of the tournament. Federer was shocked in the
fourth round by Argentina's Guillermo Canas, the same player who
ended his 41-match winning streak in the second round at Indian
Wells.


Canas will bid for a semi-final berth on Thursday when he takes
on sixth-seeded Spaniard Tommy Robredo, while seventh-seeded
Croatian Ivan Ljubicic takes on Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela.
