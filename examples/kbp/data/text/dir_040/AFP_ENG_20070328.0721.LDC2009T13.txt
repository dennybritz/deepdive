Brazil's low-cost airline GOL said Wednesday it agreed to buy
former national flag carrier Varig for 320 million dollars,
forging a group expected to carry 320 million passengers a year.


Controlling shareholder GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes agreed to
buy all the Varig shares from the US-Brazilian-owned group
VarigLog pending regulator approval, the budget carrier said in a
statement.


"With this acquisition, Brazil will maintain an important flag in
global aviation, the industry will benefit from an increase in
jobs and demand will be better served," said GOL's chief
executive, Constantino de Oliveira Junior.


Varig (VRG), once the country's proud national carrier, was saved
from liquidation in July 2006 when VarigLog, owned by the US-
Brazilian investor group Volo do Brasil, bought it for a
knockdown 24 million dollars.


GOL announced plans to expand the crippled airline's services.


VRG's fleet will be increased from 17 aircraft to 34 Boeings to
serve Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Milan and Paris, plus Miami, New
York and Mexico City, and several destinations in South America.


"VRG will operate with its own brand, differentiated services,
incorporating the low-cost business model from GOL, and
independent administration," the statement said.
