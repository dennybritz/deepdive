A car rigged with explosives and stuffed with a corpse blew up in
Baghdad on Thursday, killing two policemen after officers came to
retrieve the body, a security official said.


Iraqi policemen, who are a daily target for Sunni insurgents
opposed to the Shiite-led government authorities, found the car
parked in the Al-Amel district of central Baghdad with a corpse
dumped in the vehicle.


When the policemen approached to examine the body, the vehicle
exploded, killing two policemen and wounding another six, the
security official said.


Iraqi and US troops last month launched a massive crackdown in
and around Baghdad, deploying 80,000 soldiers in the streets in a
bid to wrest back control of the war-torn capital from insurgents
and sectarian killings.
