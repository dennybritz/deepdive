President George W. Bush told Russian President Vladimir Putin
Wednesday that a planned US missile shield in Europe is to defend
against Middle East threats, the White House said.


"President Bush emphasized that missile defenses in Europe are
intended to protect against the evolving ballistic missile threat
from the Middle East -- a threat that we share in common with
Europe and Russia," said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe.


The United States is currently concerned about Iran's ballistic
missiles.


In what was a "thorough and open" phone conversation initiated by
the White House, according to the Kremlin, the two men discussed
their differences over the missile defense plans and the fate of
the Serbian province of Kosovo.


They also covered the Iranian nuclear standoff, especially the
recent UN resolution aimed at increasing pressure on Tehran, the
Kremlin said.


Johndroe said the two leaders "discussed the importance of
continuing consultations at NATO on missile threats and defenses
against them, and exploring options for further missile defense
cooperation."


Russia has strongly objected to the US plans to place components
of the shield in the Czech Republic and Poland as well as in one
of the South Caucasus nations, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
