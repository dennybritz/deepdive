Football legend Diego Maradona was rushed to a hospital in
Argentina's capital Wednesday after suffering an unspecified
"decompensation," the local Guemes Hospital said.


Maradona was taken by ambulance to the hospital "to undergo an
examination after having suffered a decompensation," it said,
while not explaining any details.


However, the hospital said, "it does not have any relation to the
consumption of dangerous drugs."


The troubled 46-year-old star was taken to the hospital after
feeling ill at his parents' house, Argentine television said.


His daughters, Dalma and Giannina, and his personal physician,
Alfredo Cahe, entered the facility later, according to the TV
reports.


Cahe made no comment as he arrived at the hospital.


Police lined up outside the hospital as dozens of fans stood
around anxiously waiting for news about the former football
star's health.


Maradona shares the FIFA title of the 20th century's best player
with Brazil's Pele after a sparkling career with Boca Juniors,
Barcelona and Napoli.


But his career was dogged by controversy over misbehavior on and
off the field, including several suspensions for drug use.


Since he stopped playing he has undergone treatment for substance
abuse and also for weight gain.


Twice, in 2000 and 2004, he was hospitalized for heart attacks
after cocaine overdoses, and then in 2005 he had gastric bypass
surgery in attempt to fight obesity.


Earlier this month Argentina's central bank announced Maradona
was under investigation over possible financial irregularities.
