Japanese share prices fell 0.92 percent in morning deals
Thursday, tracking Wall Street lower after Federal Reserve chief
Ben Bernanke said the housing market outlook was uncertain,
dealers said.


They said that a jump in oil prices, triggered by rising tensions
between the West and Iran, also weighed on sentiment after the
remarks from Bernanke, who added that inflation remained a
concern.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 158.48 points to 17,096.25 by the lunch break.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section shed 15.77 points -- also a fall of 0.92 percent -- to
1,695.29.
