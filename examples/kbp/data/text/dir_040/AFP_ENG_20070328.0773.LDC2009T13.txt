Defending champion and world record holder Brendan Hansen
Thursday pulled out of the 200m breaststroke heats at the world
championships here due to illness.


US Swimming said the American star fell ill on Wednesday evening
after returning from the pool where he won silver in the 50m
breaststroke final.


"Hansen was monitored by doctors through the night, but Team USA
physician Ken Haller decided that he should not swim in
Thursday's event," US Swimming said in a statement.


"Hansen will take the next three days to recover and is expected
to return for Sunday's 4x100m medley relay," it added.


Hansen became the most successful breaststroker in world
championship history with victory over Japanese rival Kosuke
Kitajima to retain his 100m crown Monday.
