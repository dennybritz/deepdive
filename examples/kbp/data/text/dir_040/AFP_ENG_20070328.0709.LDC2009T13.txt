A Canadian man who confessed after a painstaking four month
police sting to drowning his three-year-old twin daughters was
sentenced to life in prison Wednesday, Canadian media reported.


A jury in Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada found
Nelson Hart, 38, guilty for the murder of daughters Karen and
Krista in 2002, CBC television said.


His confession came after an elaborate setup by Canadian police
in 2005, when they posed as local people and hired Hart to work
for them for 15,000 dollars.


It took four months before they could get Hart to admit he killed
the girls, on one occasion telling his supposed bosses he
committed the murder and on another saying how he pushed them
into the water.


The defense had argued during the trial that such confessions
were not valid because he made them under fear from his pseudo-
employers.


They told me I'd have my ribs broke," Hart told the court. "I had
to make myself look like a big criminal, just like they were."


At first he told the police that the two girls had fallen into
the water, but later he changed his story and said that the twins
drowned while he was having an epileptic fit, according to CBC.


Hart's lawyer said he would appeal.
