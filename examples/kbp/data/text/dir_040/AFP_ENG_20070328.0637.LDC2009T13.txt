Briton Richard Rogers, an architect of Paris's Centre Pompidou,
was announced winner of the 2007 Pritzker Architecture Prize.


Rogers, 73, will receive 100,000 dollars and a medal, according
to the Los Angeles-based Hyatt Foundation, which issues the
prize.


"Rogers is a champion of urban life and believes in the potential
of the city to be a catalyst for social change," Thomas Pritzker,
president of The Hyatt Foundation, quoted from the jury citation.


The foundation cited Rogers' own writing, that cities of the
future "will no longer be zoned as today in isolated one-activity
ghettos."


"Rather, they will resemble the more richly layered cities of the
past. Living, work, shopping, learning and leisure will overlap
and be housed in continuous, varied and changing structures."


Renzo Piano, who co-designed the Paris museum, won the prize in
1998.


Rogers will become the 31st recipient of the prize, which has
been given since 1979. He will receive his prize on June 4, in
London.


Rogers, whose firm is in London, was born in Florence, Italy, and
trained as an architect in England at the Architectural
Association and then in the United States at Yale University.


He also designed the headquarters of Lloyd's of London, the
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France and a new
terminal at the Madrid Barajas International Airport.
