Chinese share prices were mixed in morning trade, as profit-
taking in Shenzhen was offset by interest in financial stocks in
Shanghai, dealers said.


They said that buying in banks, brokerages and real estate stocks
pushed up the key Shanghai index by 2.38 percent, but Shenzhen's
technology-heavy board was unable to follow suit, slipping 0.96
percent.


Turnover remained strong amid expectations that fresh funds, a
plan by regulators to soon launch index futures and a set of
strong corporate earnings will see share prices move even higher
still.


On Wednesday total volumes in Shanghai and Shenzhen were
particularly heavy at more than 28 billion dollars, a level that
makes mainland China the most active market in Asia, even ahead
of Tokyo.


"The Shanghai market continued to be buoyed by strong
institutional interest in financial stocks ahead of the upcoming
(launch of) index futures, said Zeng Bo, an analyst at Changjiang
Securities.


"These banks and brokerages are all expected to post robust
earnings for this year," Zeng added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
up 75.55 points at 3,248.57.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 80.09 points or 2.4 percent at
3,414.66 while the Shenzhen A-share Index fell 8.36 points to
864.37.
