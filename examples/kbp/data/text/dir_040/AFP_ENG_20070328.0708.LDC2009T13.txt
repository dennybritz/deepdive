The elder brother of Fidel Castro said Wednesday the sidelined
leader is well and strong after eight months' recovery from
intestinal surgery.


"He is in one piece," said Ramon Castro, and "very well."


"These Castros are tough," said the elder Castro, 82.


Fidel Castro, 80, has ruled Cuba for nearly five decades, but on
July 31 handed power "temporarily" to his younger brother, Raul
Castro, 75.


Ramon Castro, an advisor to agriculture ministry spoke with
reporters at an agricultural fair 25 kilometers (15 miles)
outside Havana.


When reporters asked him when his brother would return to the
helm, "Mongo" Castro responded with an agrarian aphorism: "Don't
stir up a hornet's nest!"


Fidel Castro has defied predictions of his enemies in Washington
and Miami that he would never return to power, or that the
Americas' only communist government would collapse without him.
