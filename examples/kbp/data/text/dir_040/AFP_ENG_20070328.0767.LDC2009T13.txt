Football legend Diego Maradona was rushed to a hospital in
Argentina's capital Wednesday, local television reported.


Maradona was taken by ambulance to Guemes Hospital, but the
reason for his urgent treatment was not immediately given, Clarin
daily reported on its website. His daughters, Dalma and Giannina,
and his personal physician Alfredo Cahe entered the facility
later, Clarin said.


Earlier this month Argentina's central bank announced Maradona
was under investigation over possible financial irregularities.


The troubled 46-year-old star, dogged by controversy throughout
his career, has battled several health scares.


Regarded as one of the world's greatest-ever footballers,
Maradona shares FIFA's title of the 20th century's best player
with Brazil's Pele after a sparkling career with Boca Juniors,
Barcelona and Napoli.
