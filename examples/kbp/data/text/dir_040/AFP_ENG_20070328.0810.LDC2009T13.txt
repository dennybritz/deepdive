Out-of-form Grant Hackett faced a difficult task to keep his
decade-long unbeaten 1500-metre freestyle record intact but he
has not quitting, team head coach Alan Thompson said Thursday.


There has been conjecture that the four-times world champion and
world record holder would withdraw from his signature event after
a floundering seventh in the 800m freestyle almost 8.5 seconds
behind Tunisian Oussama Mellouli on Wednesday.


Hackett, the most-decorated swimmer in world championship history
with 18 medals, including 10 golds, has now lost both his
400/800m freestyle world crowns in the space of four days at his
home world titles.


He is the only swimmer in history to win the same event (1500m)
in four consecutive world championships stretching back to Perth
in 1998.


But his run looks under serious threat given his alarming drop-
off in form following a disrupted training preparation.


Thompson said he had spoken twice to Hackett after the 800m
defeat and there were no doubts where the swimmer wanted to go.


"We've spoken about it and there's never been an option of
pulling out of the event," Thompson told a press conference.


"He's had a lot of disruptions in his life and training and it's
had a greater effect on his performances than he thought.


"It doesn't matter how mentally strong you are, if you haven't
prepared your body well enough you can't will it to happen.


"He admits it himself, that he just hasen't done enough work but
he will be giving his best in Saturday's heats of the 1500m as he
has always done."
