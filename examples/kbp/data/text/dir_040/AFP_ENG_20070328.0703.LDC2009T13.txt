Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and prime minister Ismail
Haniya met late Wednesday with Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of an Arab summit in Riyadh.


"The meeting was positive and constructive," Abbas told
reporters.


He said the talks covered a Western financial boycott of the
Palestinian government, the recently formed national unity
cabinet grouping Haniya's Islamist Hamas movement with his
secular Fatah party and "Palestinian-Iranian relations."


Hamas has close ties with Iran, whose foreign minister was in
Saudi Arabia to attend the opening session of the two-day summit
earlier Wednesday.


Iran helped the Hamas-led Palestinian government during a
crippling Western aid blockade by giving millions of dollars in
financial assistance.


Hamas recently formed a unity government with the party of US-
backed Abbas in a bid to end a bloody rivalry between the two
groups and secure the lifting of the financial boycott.


But the international Quartet -- the United States, the European
Union, the United Nations and Russia --  has linked a lifting of
the blockade to Hamas meeting demands to recognise Israel,
renounce violence and abide by past agreements with the Jewish
state.


Israel, which regards Iran as its chief enemy, accuses Tehran of
training Hamas militants.
