India's World Cup cricketers began returning home early Thursday
amid tight security that prevented disgruntled fans from staging
any protests over their shock first round exit.


A pack of journalists were the only people to greet batsman
Virender Sehwag and wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni when they
touched down at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi airport just before
midnight.


Security personnel whisked both players from the terminal into
waiting cars before the media could approach them.


Coach Greg Chappell, batting superstar Sachin Tendulkar, Ajit
Agarkar, Munaf Patel and Irfan Pathan arrived in Mumbai a few
hours later, where they were greeted by cricket board secretary
Niranjan Shah and other officials.


Captain Rahul Dravid and his Bangalore team-mates Anil Kumble and
Robin Uthappa also arrived home safely.


Former captain Sourav Ganguly was expected to remain in London
for a few days. The travel plans of the remaining players were
not immediately known.


Indian police, aware of the hostile protesters that greeted
Pakistan's team on Wednesday, tightened security at airports and
around the players' homes to prevent any incident.


"We want to ensure the players are not hassled," Mumbai's joint
commissioner of police, Arup Patnaik, told reporters.


Angry fans had taken to the streets when India were knocked out
of the first round at the ongoing World Cup in the Caribbean.


The Indian board has summoned Chappell, Dravid and former
captains like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev for a meeting in
Mumbai on April 6 and 7 to discuss the World Cup debacle.
