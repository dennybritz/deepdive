At least five people were killed in heavy fighting between
Ethiopian troops and unidentified insurgents in a southern
neighbourhood of Mogadishu Thursday morning, witnesses and an AFP
correspondent said.


An AFP correspondent saw two dead civilians in the fighting in
the Ali Kamin neighbourhood, and witnesses said three others had
died.


"I have seen two people killed by stray bullets and I have also
seen three others wounded. I can see the Ethiopian tanks taking
positions in our neighbourhood, in front of my house," said
resident Mohamed Ali Hassan.


"I have seen a neighbour killed by stray bullets," said Hawo
Moalil. "My younger daughter was wounded by a stray bullet."


The clash was the first significant fighting since the Hawiye
clan, which has largely controlled the Somali capital since 1991,
reached a ceasefire deal with the Ethiopian forces last Friday.


Ethiopian troops deployed in the neighbourhood on Wednesday
evening.


Ethiopian forces, which support the Somalian transition
government, chased Islamist forces out of the capital and the
southern half of the country three months ago, but have come
under increasing attacks by insurgents.


A bloody power struggle that followed the 1991 ouster of dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre exploded into inter-clan warfare that has
defied more than 14 attempts to restore a functional government
in Somalia.
