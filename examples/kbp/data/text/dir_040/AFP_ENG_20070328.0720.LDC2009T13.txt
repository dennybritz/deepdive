Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga took four wickets in four
balls in the World Cup Super Eight match against South Africa
here on Wednesday to become the first man to achieve the feat in
the history of international cricket.


Malinga dismissed Shaun Pollock, Andrew Hall and then Jacques
Kallis to ensure a hat-trick and then got rid of Makhaya Ntini
before South Africa squeezed home with a one-wicket win.


The 23-year-old Malinga became the fifth man in the history of
the World Cup to take a hat-trick.


"I am happy to take those wickets but we have lost," said
Malinga, the bleach- blond bowler with the distinctive slingy
action.


"I felt good and I thought we might pinch it. But 209 was not
enough to defend."
