A Chinese zoo has paid out compensation of 44,000 dollars to a
man whose six- year-old daughter was mauled to death by a tiger,
state press reported.


The girl was standing behind the tiger while waiting to have her
photo taken with the animal but it turned around and bit her
head, Xinhua news agency said in a report late Wednesday.


The death, on February 22, was the second fatal tiger attack at
Kunming Zoo in China's southwest Yunnan province. A Bengal tiger
killed a female employee at the zoo in October 2001, according to
Xinhua.


The girl's father, Mo Jicai, said the zoo had agreed to pay him
340,000 yuan (44,000 dollars) as compensation for losing his
daughter, but that he was not satisfied.


"Nothing can compensate for the loss of my daughter. I hope the
government can ban dangerous circus performances in case more
people are hurt," Xinhua quoted Mo as saying.


The report did not give any details about the fate of the tiger,
which was from a circus.
