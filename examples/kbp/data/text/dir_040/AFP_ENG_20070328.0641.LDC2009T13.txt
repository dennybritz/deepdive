Mark Cohon, a vice-president of business development for the
National Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the
Canadian Football League here Wednesday.


Cohon, who oversaw international marketing efforts for the NBA,
had also served as director of corporate and game development for
Major League Baseball International in more than 15 years as a
sports league executive.


"I'm absolutely thrilled about this opportunity and look forward
to leading one of Canada's oldest and most treasured traditions,"
Cohon said.


Cohon replaced Tom Wright, who had served as boss of the eight-
team gridiron league since November of 2002.


"We were impressed with Mark's proven ability to build brands and
grow revenues," said Gene Dunn, chairman of the league board of
governors.
