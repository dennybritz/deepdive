The United States said Wednesday it was "deeply concerned" about
arrests of opposition members in Zimbabwe and called on African
nations to publicly denounce the crackdown.


"The United States is deeply concerned about the detention of
Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Zimbabwe opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC), and other opposition officials today at
the MDC's headquarters in Harare," State Department spokesman Tom
Casey said in a statement.


Tsvangirai was planning to hold a news conference "drawing
attention to a series of abductions of MDC officials by what are
believed to be government agents," Casey said.


"We hold (Zimbabwe's) President (Robert) Mugabe responsible for
the safety of these Zimbabwean citizens and we call on Zimbabwean
authorities to investigate these attacks and punish those
responsible."


According to the MDC, Tsvangirai was briefly arrested, barely two
weeks after his arrest on March 11 when he was badly beaten in
detention. The Zimbabwean police later Wednesday denied that he
was arrested.


The US State Department spokesman called on the presidents of the
Southern African Development Committee, which is meeting Thursday
in Tanzania, to "publicly call Mugabe to account for his
misrule."
