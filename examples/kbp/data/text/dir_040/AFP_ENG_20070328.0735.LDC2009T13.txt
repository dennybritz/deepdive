The Japanese man whom police are seeking to arrest in connection
with the death of a young British woman in suburban Tokyo was
stalking her, The Times reported in an early edition of its
Thursday paper.


An unnamed colleague of 22-year-old English teacher Lindsay Ann
Hawker at the chain of English schools in the suburbs of Tokyo
told the paper: "She was stalked, that's the truth."


"She was completely blameless. Her only crime was that she was
trying to help, and she was overconfident and a little bit naive
in a country where she fitted the stereotype of a tall, beautiful
Western girl."


Police are looking for Tatsuya Ichihashi, 28, who allegedly
dashed out of his apartment in Chiba, east of Tokyo, when police
officers visited to question him.


Hawker was believed to have promised to provide an English lesson
to Ichihashi outside of the privately run English conversation
school where she worked, public broadcaster NHK reported.


Her body was found bruised and naked in a disconnected bathtub
filled with sand on the balcony.


The Times reported that detectives said that Ichihashi had
approached Hawker at a train station near his apartment.


"He got on the last train and talked to her on her journey home,"
an unidentified American friend of Hawker's was quoted as saying
by The Times.


"She got on her bike and he ran behind her. This guy was a
runner, he was like a college athlete."
