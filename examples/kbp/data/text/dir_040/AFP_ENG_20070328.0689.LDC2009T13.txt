Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Saudi King Abdullah, whose
relations chilled over Lebanon last year, met in Riyadh Wednesday
for the second time in as many days.


The late night meeting was held on the sidelines of an Arab
summit which opened in the Saudi capital earlier Wednesday and
came a few hours after Assad held talks with Saudi Foreign
Minister Saud al-Faisal.


A source in Assad's entourage said Assad and Saud followed up on
the "positive" talks the Syrian leader held with King Abdullah
late Tuesday, and which focused on "normalising relations"
between the two countries and the situation in the region.


He did not give further details, but said Assad would also have
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday on the
sidelines of the summit.


Assad's meeting with Abdullah Tuesday was the first since
Damascus and Riyadh fell out over the wisdom of pro-Syrian
Hezbollah's capture of two Israeli soldiers which sparked a
34-day Israeli onslaught on Lebanon last summer.


Relations were further strained over Syrian policy in Lebanon in
recent months after the opposition led by Shiite Hezbollah
launched a campaign to oust the government of Western-backed
Sunni Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, who is close to Saudi Arabia.


Saudi-led efforts to resolve the crisis in Lebanon failed to
yield a breakthrough in the run-up to the Arab summit.


Siniora, who also met the Saudi king Tuesday, told AFP that the
talks between Abdullah and Assad were "a positive first step"
toward easing the crisis.
