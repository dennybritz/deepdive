Ian Thorpe has paid tribute to American Michael Phelps for
smashing his world record in the 200-metres freestyle at the
world championships just four months after the Australian great's
retirement.


Phelps seized Thorpe's six-year world mark with a scintillating
one minute 43.86 seconds swim in the final on Tuesday.


Thorpe broke the 200m world record six times during his stellar
career, which officially ended last November when he announced
his retirement.


Thorpe was not at the pool to see Phelps break the record with
prior speaking engagement away from Melbourne.


But the Athens Olympics 200m freestyle champion said he was
surprised to hear the result, while being excited for Phelps and
his camp.


"I was disappointed I didn't get to see the race," Thorpe told
Thursday's The Australian newspaper.


"I was on a plane back from Adelaide after being with the
Australian Olympic soccer team.


"Although I was surprised to hear the result, my heartfelt
congratulations go out to Michael and his coach Bob Bowman.


"I look forward to congratulating him in person on my return to
Melbourne later in the week."


Thorpe said he hoped his best time would continue to fall down
the list.


"I hope this time continues to drop in the future," he said.


Phelps's swim leaves just the 400m freestyle world record with
Thorpe.


The American obliterated his world record in the 200m butterfly
by 1.71 seconds on Wednesday to capture his third gold medal at
the world championships.
