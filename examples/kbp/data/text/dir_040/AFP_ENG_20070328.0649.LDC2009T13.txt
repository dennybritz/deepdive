Boeing Co. said Wednesday its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft would
be unveiled on July 8, with its first test flight set for August
and initial delivery on track for May 2008.


A spokesman for the US aerospace giant said a public presentation
would be held at an assembly facility in Everett, Washington, in
the Pacific northwest.


The plane is set to be Boeing's biggest commercial success, with
391 orders from 39 airlines since the launch announcement in
April 2004. That would mean as much as 75 billion dollars in
sales at list prices.


Boeing's order book for the Dreamliner is full, with any new
orders to be delivered no sooner than 2013. The success of the
new plane has allowed Boeing to overtake Airbus as the world's
biggest aircraft maker, based on last year's orders.


Airbus will need another five years for the launch of its answer
to the 787, the A350.


The Dreamliner will have a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (647 miles
or 1,050 kilometers per hour) and will carry 250 to 300
passengers.


With a range of up to 14,500 kilometers (7,800 nautical miles),
the aircraft will use 20 percent less fuel than any other plane
of its size through engine improvements and the use of lighter
composite metals for structure, according to Boeing.
