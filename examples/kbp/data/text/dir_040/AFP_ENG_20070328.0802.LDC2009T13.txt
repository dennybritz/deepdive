China has made "little to no progress" in opening key market
sectors, a senior US commerce official said Thursday, as he
warned of a souring mood in Washington over trade issues with the
Asian nation.


China cannot rest on its laurels after the steps it has taken to
liberalise its economy during its first five years in the World
Trade Organisation and it needs to move forward, US
Undersecretary of Commerce Frank Lavin said.


"In a number of critical sectors there has been little to no
progress in market opening," Lavin told an audience of US
businesspeople in Beijing.


"Our point is that the world economy is moving, so we should
always look ahead. We can't simply say in 2002, we fixed a
problem, in 2004 we fixed another problem. We have to say, what
are we fixing in '07 and '08."


China accounted for 28 percent of the US record 763.6 billion-
dollar deficit in 2006 and Lavin warned that concerns in
Washington about the imbalance were growing stronger.


"The atmosphere on US-China trade issues is probably more
negative now than at any time I've ever seen," Lavin said.


The yawning trade surplus has led to American calls for more open
trade and a rise in the Chinese currency to erase some of the
alleged unfair advantages enjoyed by the Asian giant's exporters.


The undersecretary mentioned barriers to business in sectors
ranging from telecom to civil aviation, saying US carriers were
eager to open up new routes to China.


"If there is that kind of demand (in aviation), let's just
liberalise. Why not just open them all up?" he said.
