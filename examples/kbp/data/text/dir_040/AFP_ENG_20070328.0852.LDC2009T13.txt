A Sri Lankan naval patrol has sunk at least three suspected Tamil
Tiger boats off the island's northeastern coast, the defence
ministry said Thursday.


The four-hour battle erupted off the seas of Alampil late
Wednesday and involved a flotilla of 10 rebel boats, the ministry
said, adding that one of its sailors had suffered injuries.


The ministry said three of the Tiger boats were destroyed while a
fourth was damaged.


"These three Tiger craft caught fire initially and later sank,
killing the Sea Tigers on board," the ministry said. "Naval
authorities believe that there were about 12 to 15 Sea Tiger
cadres in the destroyed boats."


The attack came a day after the military said it captured a key
rebel base in the east of the island without a fight. The rebels
had withdrawn from the Kokkadichcholai base by the time the
troops moved in, the military said.
