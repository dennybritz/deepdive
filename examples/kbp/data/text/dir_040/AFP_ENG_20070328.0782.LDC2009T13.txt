Japan and China were to resume talks Thursday on the development
of disputed gas fields in the East China Sea, one of a series of
issues that have put a strain on bilateral ties.


Kenichiro Sasae, head of the Japanese foreign ministry's Asian
and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, and his Chinese counterpart Hu
Zhengyue will lead the seventh round of talks on the issue, due
to begin at 2:30 pm (0530 GMT).


At the last round held in Beijing in July last year, the two
sides agreed to form a panel of experts to break the deadlock in
the drawn-out negotiations, which started in 2004.


Japan and China have long disputed their sea border and Beijing
insists it has the right to explore for oil and gas along its
continental shelf in the East China Sea.


But Japan says some of the gas fields lie too close to its
exclusive economic zone -- a delineation not recognised by China
-- and fears Beijing might siphon off resources from an area
Japan claims as its own.


Tensions escalated between the two countries last year after
Japan said it had spotted flames indicating China had started
production close to the area where Japan claims development
rights. China began test-drilling in 2003.


The talks come two days after the government in Tokyo announced
that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao would visit Japan from April 11.
He will be the first Chinese leader to come to Tokyo since 2000.
