Twenty-six people were killed after an explosion at a coal mine
in northern China that was operating well above its capacity,
state media reported Thursday.


Nineteen people had initially been confirmed dead after
Wednesday's blast but the bodies of seven other workers were
recovered on Thursday, Xinhua news agency said.


There were 106 miners working underground at the mine in Linfen
city, Shanxi province, when the explosion occurred, with 80
managing to escape, Xinhua said, citing local rescue officials.


Local safety authorities said the mine's production licence had
expired and that it was running at nearly double its annual
capacity of 90,000 tonnes of coal, according to Xinhua.


"Preliminary investigation showed working conditions in the mine
were very unsafe and chaotic before the accident occurred,"
Xinhua quoted a local police officer as saying.


Police have detained the mine's owner, manager and several other
people linked to the colliery, Xinhua said.


The accident is the second tragedy to hit Shanxi, China's coal
mining heartland, this month, after 21 miners were killed in
another gas blast on March 18.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
