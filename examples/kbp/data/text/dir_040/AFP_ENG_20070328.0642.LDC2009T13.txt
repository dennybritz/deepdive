Three people were killed and a 12-year-old girl is missing after
a ferry hit a private boat near the Australian capital's iconic
Harbour Bridge, reports said Thursday.


The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the ferry hit the
pleasure boat, which was carrying about 12 people, at around
10:45pm (1245 GMT).


Two men and one woman died after the smaller boat rolled and many
of the passengers were thrown into the water, the paper's website
said.


"We have three deceased. Two women with serious injuries have
gone to hospital," a New South Wales Ambulance Service spokesman
said.


Eleven of the 12 people believed to have been on board the
smaller boat were accounted for.


Rescue helicopters, a naval patrol boat and police divers were
still searching for the missing girl.


A witness, Clive Marshall, said the passengers on the boat were
thrown into the water on impact. "The boat basically just
disintegrated," said Mr Marshall, who was on a passing ferry.


Staff from both ferries dived into the water and rescued a number
of passengers, the report said.
