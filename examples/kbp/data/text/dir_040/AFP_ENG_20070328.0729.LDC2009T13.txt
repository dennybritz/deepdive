The elder brother of Fidel Castro said Wednesday the sidelined
leader is well and strong after eight months' recovery from
intestinal surgery.


"He is in one piece," said Ramon Castro, and "very well."


"These Castros are tough," said the elder Castro, 82.


Fidel Castro, 80, has ruled Cuba for nearly five decades, but on
July 31 handed power "temporarily" to his younger brother, Raul
Castro, 75.


Ramon Castro, an advisor to agriculture ministry spoke with
reporters at an agricultural fair 25 kilometers (15 miles)
outside Havana.


When reporters asked him when his brother would return to the
helm, "Mongo" Castro responded with an agrarian aphorism: "Don't
stir up a hornet's nest!"


Fidel Castro has defied predictions of his enemies in Washington
and Miami that he could never return to power, or that the
Americas' only communist government would collapse without him.


On March 21, however, a State Department spokesman said the
United States sees no sign that Fidel Castro may return to power.


Asked about remarks by Cuban officials that Fidel Castro was well
on the mend, spokesman Sean McCormack said: "I haven't seen any
evidence of that."


In Havana, a top cabinet member said March 20 that Fidel Castro
could resume a more active role in government work "soon."


"What we are expecting is that we will have him back (at work)
with us, in a more active way, soon," Communist Party Politburo
member and Basic Industry Minister Yadira Garcia told reporters.
