Republican ex-mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani won backing
for his 2008 presidential bid from billionaire publisher Steve
Forbes, who will also help lead his campaign, Giuliani's team
said.


Forbes, editor-in-chief of Forbes Magazine which publishes an
annual list of the world's richest people, will act as co-chair
on the national campaign and as senior policy advisor to
Giuliani, who is favorite to win his party's nomination for the
presidency early next year.


Forbes himself sought the Republican nomination for the
presidency in 1996 and 2000.


"Steve and I share an economic vision that embraces supply-side
economics, tax relief, and spending restraint," Giuliani said in
a statement released by his campaign team.


"As mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani showed how exercising
fiscal discipline, including tax cuts, lowers deficits, spurs
economic growth, and increases revenue," Forbes was quoted as
saying in the statement.


"It is time the rest of the country benefit from a true fiscal
conservative leader who gets real results."


Giuliani leads the Republican field with a campaign built on his
role as New York mayor during 2001, when he won praise for his
handling of the aftermath of the devastating September 11
attacks.
