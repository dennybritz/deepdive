Six construction workers were buried when a subway tunnel being
built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics collapsed, and rescuers give
them little chance of survival, China's state press reported
Thursday.


The accident early Wednesday occurred in Beijing's Haidian
university district on the No 10 subway line, the People's Daily
reported on its website.


The line crosses northern Beijing and will link up to the Olympic
Village when it is finished in 2008.


Rescue efforts were continuing but so far the missing workers
have not been traced, the report said.


"According to rescue workers, the chance of finding them alive is
small," the report said.


Press reports gave no details as to why the collapse occurred.


Subway officials refused to comment on the collapse when
contacted by AFP Thursday while the Beijing government's
spokesman's office said no information was available on the
missing workers.


Beijing is constructing four subway lines and an airport light
rail project that are slated to be finished in time for the
Olympic Games in August next year.
