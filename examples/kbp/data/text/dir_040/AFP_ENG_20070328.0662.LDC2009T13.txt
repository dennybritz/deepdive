Nine people appeared in court Wednesday following a riot in the
subway station below Paris's main Gare Du Nord station that
suddenly became an issue for France's presidential candidates.


Two more held after Tuesday's clashes remain in custody, police
said, and a decision on another two people was expected later.


About 100 youths gathered at the station, where the mainline
Eurostar terminal is a major gateway from Paris to the rest of
Europe, in protest at what they perceived to be the use of
excessive force in the man's arrest.


Dozens of rioters attacked windows, vending machines and shops in
the main hall of the subway station for several hours before
police dispersed the crowd late on Tuesday using tear-gas.


Eight railway officials and one police officer were lightly hurt.


The violence raised the spectre of the three weeks of riots in
autumn 2005, when clashes between police and youths on the
outskirts of Paris left hundreds of people injured.


Coming just weeks before France's presidential elections,
Tuesday's riot has became a political issue.


Socialist challenger Segolene Royal and centrist Francois Bayrou
have accused the ruling centre-right -- and its presidential
candidate Nicolas Sarkozy -- of creating a climate of hostility
between police and youths.
