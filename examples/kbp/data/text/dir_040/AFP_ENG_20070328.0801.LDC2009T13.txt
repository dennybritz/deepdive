Texas authorities executed Wednesday a man convicted of murder in
a 1997 carjacking, the state Department of Criminal Justice said.


Vincent Gutierrez, 28, was declared dead from lethal injection at
6:23 pm (2323 GMT), seven minutes after the start of the deadly
dose, the department said.


Just before he was executed, Gutierrez said he was "sorry about
the situation that happened."


His parents and one of his brothers attended the execution.


Gutierrez and Randy Arroyo, aged 18 and 17 at the time,
respectively, attacked Jose Cobo, 40, a US Air Force captain,
while they were stealing his car.


Cobo was pushed from his vehicle after being shot twice. He was
transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.


Gutierrez and Arroyo were arrested shortly after the crime. They
were both convicted and sentenced to death.


After the US Supreme Court banned in 2005 the death penalty for
prisoners convicted for a crime committed when they were minors,
Arroyo's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.


Gutierrez is the 11th person executed this year in the United
States, where more than 3,300 convicts are on death row. Ten of
the executions took place in Texas, where nearly half of the 53
US executions took place in 2006.


Texas is one of the few states that has scheduled executions in
the coming months. Many states have suspended them, however, most
due to questions about lethal injection methods, and as a result
of DNA evidence raising doubts about many convictions.
