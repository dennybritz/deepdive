US Marines may be tough, but after April 1 they won't be able to
show it with big tattoos.


Marine Corps Commandant James Conway has slapped a ban on new
tattoos that are visible when a marine is dressed in shorts and a
T-shirt.


Effective April 1, "Marines are prohibited from: tattoos or
brands on the head and neck. Sleeve tattos are likewise
prohibited," the new regulations stated.


The regulations explain that a sleeve tattoo "is a very large
tattoo, or a collection of smaller tattoos, that covers or almost
covers a persons entire arm or leg."


It said half-sleeve tattoos, or quarter sleeve tattoos also are
prohibited if they are visible when a marine is wearing shorts
and a T-shirt.


"Tattoos or brands that are prejudicial to good order, discipine
and morale, or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the Marine
Corps are also prohibited," it said.


That includes "any tattoo that is sexist, racist, vulgar, anti-
America, anti- social, gang related, or extremist group or
organization related."


Marines already covered in tattoos can keep them.


But they have to document them with a signed and dated photograph
for their records and measurements of each tattoo.


In a message, Conway said he was concerned about the growing use
of tattoos.


"I understand many tattoos are in good taste, and many represent
pride for our Corps or remembrance of fallen comrades. However, I
believe tattoos of an excessive nature do not represent our
traditional values."
