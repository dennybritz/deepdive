Striker Halil Altintop scored a last minute leveller as Turkey
drew 2-2 with Norway in Frankfurt on Wednesday night in their
Euro 2008 qualifier.


Having gone 2-0 down at half-time after Simon Brenne and Martin
Anderson netted for Norway, Turkey hit back after the break as
Schalke 04 striker Altintop scored in the 72nd and 90th minutes
to claim a point for the hosts.


Turkey lead Group C with 13 points, one ahead of second-placed
rivals and Euro 2004 winners Greece.


They are currently forced to play home games outside of Turkey as
punishment for their players' part in a brawl with Switzerland
players following a World Cup play-off defeat two years ago.
