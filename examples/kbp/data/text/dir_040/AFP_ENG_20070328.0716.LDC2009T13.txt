Sri lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga created history on Wednesday
when he became the first man in the history of international
cricket to take four wickets in four balls.


The 23-year-old, with the distinctive slinging action, achieved
the feat in his team's World Cup Super Eights match against South
Africa at the new Providence stadium.


Unfortunately for Malinga, it was not enough to prevent his team
from slipping to a one-wicket defeat.


Malinga's four-in-four:


44.5 over: Shaun Pollock b Malinga 13


44.6 over: Andrew Hall c Tharanga b Malinga 0


46.1 over: Jacques Kallis c Sangakkara b Malinga 86


46.2 over: Makhaya Ntini b Malinga 0
