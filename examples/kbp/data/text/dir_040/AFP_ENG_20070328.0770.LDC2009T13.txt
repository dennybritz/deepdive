New Zealand's annual current account deficit fell in the December
quarter as the goods deficit narrowed, official figures showed
Thursday.


The deficit for the year to December was 14.4 billion dollars, or
nine percent of gross domestic product (GDP), Statistics New
Zealand said.


This was down from the 14.5-billion-dollar deficit -- which
amounted to 9.2 percent of GDP -- in the year to September.


The current account is the broadest measure of trade, services
and investment flows into and out of the country.


New Zealand's current account deficit measured as a proportion of
GDP is one of the highest in the developed world.


The current account deficit for the December quarter was 3.93
billion dollars, down from 4.67 billion dollars in the September
quarter.


A 20 percent fall in the price of petroleum products in the
fourth quarter, following six straight quarters of price
increases, helped drive down the value of imports, Statistics New
Zealand said.
