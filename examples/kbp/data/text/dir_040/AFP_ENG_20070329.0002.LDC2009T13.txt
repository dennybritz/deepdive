China's economic growth in the first quarter this year is likely
to exceed the 10.4 percent recorded for the last three months of
2006, state media said Thursday.


The economy showed no signs of slowdown despite a slew of control
measures introduced in 2006, the China Business News reported,
citing a senior economist with China's top economy planning body.


"It's safe to conclude that economic growth in the first quarter
this year is higher than the year-earlier period and the fourth
quarter last year," said Chen Dongqi, a economist at the National
Development and Reform Commission.


China, the world's fourth largest economy, reported breakneck
growth of 10.7 percent in 2006, the fourth consecutive year of
double-digit expansion.


The central bank has raised reserves banks need to keep and
increased benchmark interest rates three times since last April
to cool growth.


Beijing has also become more rigorous in approval of new projects
and cut tax rebates for exports of energy-intensive and polluting
products.


Chen predicted Beijing would step up tightening measures and
become "more flexible" in monetary policy, the report said.


But he noted that more interest rate hikes could trigger risks
involved in mortgage loans.


Chen also said it is necessary to further cut export tax rebates
for energy- intensive products including steel, coal, cement and
electrolytic aluminum.
