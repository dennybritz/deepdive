Australian airline Qantas said Thursday it was ordering nine
Airbus A320 aircraft for its budget offshoot Jetstar.


Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon said Jetstar would use the
aircraft, to be delivered from late this year, on domestic and
short-haul international routes.


He said Qantas would also boost the capacity of its full-service
domestic operations by transferring it four Boeing 767-300
aircraft currently used for international flights.


Dixon said the increased capacity for both Jetstar and Qantas
should help the airline retain its 65 percent share of the
Australian domestic market.


He did not say how much the new aircraft would cost.
