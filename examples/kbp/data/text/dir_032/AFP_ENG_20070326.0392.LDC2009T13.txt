British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett welcomed plans to
grant Kosovo conditional independence Monday, saying they would
give the province "clarity over its future".


She was responding to a report from UN chief mediator Martti
Ahtisaari, which recommends that the breakaway Serbian province
should be granted independence under initial international
supervision.


"These proposals would give Kosovo clarity over its future,"
Beckett said in a statement issued by the Foreign Office. "This
is vital for Kosovo's political and economic development.


"Implementation of the proposals would resolve the final status
issue outstanding following the break-up of the former
Yugoslavia.


"It would enable the Balkan region as a whole to draw a line
under the conflicts of the recent past and move towards a future
based around full integration with European and Euro-Atlantic
structures."


She added that the settlement proposals reflected "a balanced
approach requiring compromises from both sides."


"They contain far-reaching and extensive guarantees protecting
the rights and welfare of Kosovo's Serb and other non-Albanian
communities," she said.
