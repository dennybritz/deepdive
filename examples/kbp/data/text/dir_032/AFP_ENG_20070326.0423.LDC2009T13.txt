Former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith died last month of an
accidental drug overdose, police here told reporters Monday,
saying no foul play was suspected.


After a six-week probe, investigators said Smith, 39, who died
suddenly in a Florida hotel on February 8, died after taking
anti-anxiety medication, methadone, antiobiotics and other
prescription drugs.


"We are convinced, based on an extensive review of the evidence,
that this case is an accidental overdose with no other criminal
element present," said Broward County police chief Charlie Tiger.


"We have reviewed hundreds of hours of video, tape captured by
the hotel security cameras and we found nothing unusual," he
said.


Tiger said a laptop belong to the model's boyfriend Howard Stern
similarly revealed "nothing to indicate any foul play."


The autopsy result is the latest tragic chapter in the life of
Smith, who is buried in the Bahamas alongside her son Daniel, 20,
who died in the Bahamas of a drug overdose just months before his
mother's death.


The buxom centerfold model had become rich after her marriage to
an elderly, wheelchair-bound billionaire oil magnate, and
achieved even greater fame as the protagonist in a bizarre TV
reality show.


Since her death, survivors have battled over custody of her body,
her infant daughter, as well as control of her multi-million
dollar estate.
