World nickel prices, which have tripled in the past year, are
expected to level off by 2010-2011 with the start of production
at new facilities, experts said here on Monday at an
international nickel conference.


Jim Lennon, an analyst with the Australian bank Macquarie, said
that a 5.5-6.0 dollars a pound would be a reasonable long-term
price projection, adding growth in demand was likely to continue.


He predicted that Chinese demand would surpass what is currently
expected. China currently consumes about 260,000 tonnes of nickel
a year, or 20 percent of the world market.


Nickel on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was quoted last week at
21.59 dollars a pound, compared with an average of 10.89 dollars
in 2006.


The surge in price has been driven by booming Chinese demand,
powered by rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, and by
stagnant production capacities.


In addition LME nickel stocks are extremely low, equivalent to
only one day of industrial consumption.


Lennon said the global nickel market showed a deficit of 56,000
tonnes last year, which should be transformed into a surplus of
between six to seven thousand tonnes in three years.


New Caledonia, a French territory, possesses a quarter of the
world's nickel reserves, will be the venue until March 30 for an
international conference of 300 nickel specialists.
