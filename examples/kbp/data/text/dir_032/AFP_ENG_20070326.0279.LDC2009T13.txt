A new Kuwaiti cabinet still dominated by the ruling Al-Sabah
family was sworn in on Monday to a mixed response from the
Islamist and tribal opposition.


The 16-member line-up, which includes two women, took the oath of
office in front of Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said an
official statement carried by state media.


Its predecessor was forced to step down on March 4 after barely
eight months in office to avoid then health minister Sheikh Ahmed
al-Abdullah al-Sabah from being voted out of office by opposition
MPs.


Sheikh Ahmed, a senior member of the ruling family, was dropped
from the new cabinet but said he had chosen to step aside because
the political situation was "not helpful."


There were no major changes in the new line-up with members of
the ruling family still controlling the main posts of defence,
interior, foreign affairs and oil.


Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Mohammed al-Ahmed al-Sabah and his
cabinet all have ex-officio seats in parliament. They will be
sworn in as MPs on April 2.


One of the new ministers already faced the threat of being hauled
before parliament to answer MPs' questions.


Islamist-tribal MP Daifallah Buramia said he wanted question
Finance Minister Bader Mishari al-Humaidhi about his opposition
to a proposal to forgive Kuwaiti citizens  billions of dollars in
bank loans.


But the six MPs of the Islamic Constitutional Movement, the
Kuwaiti branch of the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, welcomed
the new cabinet and vowed to cooperate with it.
