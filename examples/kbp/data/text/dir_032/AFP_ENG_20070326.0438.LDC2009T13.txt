UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon pledged to fight anti-Semitism
around the world during a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial in Jerusalem on Monday.


"It is unacceptable to deny historical facts," the UN chief said.


Ban held a memorial ceremony in the museum's Hall of Remembrance
before signing his name in a visitor's book beneath a pledge to
fight bigotry the world over.


"I sign this book in memory of the millions of Jews and others
who were murdered in the Holocaust, and with determination to do
my utmost in the struggle against anti-Semitism, hatred and
intolerance around the world," he wrote.


The tour of the museum, a regular stop for visiting dignitaries,
concluded Ban's first visit to the Jewish state since taking
office in January. He leaves on Tuesday for Amman.
