Prosecutors in Uzbekistan have opened a criminal inquiry into a
reporter for Germany's Deutsche Welle radio for tax evasion and
working without accreditation, her lawyer said on Monday.


Natalya Bushuyeva, an Uzbek citizen, "is charged with tax evasion
and conducting her activity without a licence," her defence
lawyer, Suhrob Ismailov, told AFP.


Bushuyeva is the first journalist to be charged with unlicensed
activities since Uzbekistan adopted a law last year that bans
local journalists from working for foreign media without
accreditation.


Bushuyeva was summoned to the prosecutor's office in the capital
Tashkent last Friday.


If found guilty, she could be sentenced to up to six months in
prison.


The pro-government website www.gorizont.uz said that Bushuyeva
had worked for Deutsche Welle radio for five years and "never
declared her income... Moreover, she worked without being
accredited, which is also a breach of the law."


Uzbek authorities have tightened controls on foreign journalists
after accusing them of helping Islamic insurgents foment an
uprising in 2005 in the eastern province of Andijan that was
brutally put down by the security forces.
