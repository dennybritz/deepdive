Russian mining group Norilsk Nickel, the world's leading nickel
and palladium supplier, said on Monday it had acquired 46.2
percent of electricity provider OGK-3 for 3.087 billion dollars
(2.31 billion euros).


The Russian electricity group SEU holds 37.1 percent in OGK-3,
with the remainder -- 16.7 percent -- in the hands of minority
shareholders.


Norilsk Nickel said it would probably make a bid for stakes held
by minority shareholders.
