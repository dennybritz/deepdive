Taiwan's United Daily News group announced Monday it had launched
a tabloid newspaper focusing on hundreds of thousands of young
readers commuting daily on Taipei's subway system.


The newspaper, called Epaper, is the first of its kind to be
authorised by the Taipei Rapid Transit Company to circulate in 69
stations of the subway system linking the great Taipei area.


"In addition to the latest major news stories from here and
abroad, Epaper especially appeals to young age groups, women and
the white-collar sector," said Jeffrey Lo, chief operations
officer with the tabloid.


"The paper is rife with information for young consumers ... while
providing information on women's concerns like cosmetics and
fashion," Lo said.


"For the white-collar group, we offer information centring on
business and related fields, as well as measures to advance
English."


The 48-page tabloid is free of charge.
