The archaeological museum of the Greek Ionian Sea island of
Cephalonia was closed on Monday after a weekend of seismic
activity damaged the building and smashed items, the culture
ministry said.


An undersea tremor measuring 5.9 points on the open-ended Richter
scale on Sunday toppled a number of exhibits at Argostoli Museum,
smashing three of them, the ministry said without offering
further details.


The museum building itself sustained minor damage, with cracks
appearing in its walls.


The ministry said the museum, which displays antiquities from
Prehistoric to Roman times and includes a valuable Mycenaean
collection, will remain closed until the seismic activity is
over.


A number of aftershocks up to 5.1 points Richter were recorded on
Monday.


There were reports on Sunday of minor damage to homes and limited
rock slides on roads, but no injuries.


Government engineers have been dispatched to Cephalonia to
inspect schools and other public buildings in addition to the
island's roads, many of which are built along steep cliffs.


The Argostoli Museum was entirely destroyed in a 1953 earthquake
that devastated the island.


Greece is the most seismically active country in Europe,
accounting for half the number of earthquakes recorded on the
continent.
