Calls for the departure of Czech coach Karel Bruckner have been
made by the country's press on Monday following their 2-1 defeat
to Germany at the weekend.


The daily newspaper Sport, which pointed out the Czech Republic
had not beaten a major international team since Euro 2004 in
Portugal, said: "If the coach does not radically change the way
he works and continues to ignore modern training methods, he
should leave."


The Czech press said the team would have lost by a bigger margin
to Germany had it not been for a good showing from keeper Petr
Cech.
