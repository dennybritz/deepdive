An accord between Northern Ireland's main party leaders to
restore self-rule should lead to a "genuinely new era" for the
province, Britain's minister on the issue said Monday, agreeing
to the deal.


A smiling Peter Hain, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said
the accord struck between Democratic Unionists (DUP) leader Ian
Paisley and Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams was even better than he
could have expected.


"Today the clouds have lifted, and people can see the future," he
said, adding that "anything and everything is possible for
Northern Ireland" as a result of the deal.


"A genuinely new era can start," he said, adding: "This is where
we've always wanted to be since the Good Friday agreement," which
started the reconciliation process in Northern Ireland in 1998.


Adams and Paisley agreed earlier to restore power-sharing in
Belfast on May 8 -- six weeks later than the deadline of midnight
(2300 GMT) Monday -- in their first face-to-face talks.


Hain said the agreement to restore self-rule on May 8 was "a
great deal better than what I expected," and better than
restoring power on Monday.


"If we had restored today it would have been rather grudging and
difficult, and the executive would have stuttered into life," he
said, adding the delay would allow the administration be "really
bedded down" when it assumed power.
