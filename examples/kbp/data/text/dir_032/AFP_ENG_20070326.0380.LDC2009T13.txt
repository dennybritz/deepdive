Hugo Chavez's populist government has seized 16 estates with more
than 330,000 hectares of land, as the Venezuelan leader pursues
his quest to refashion the country into an egalitarian leftist
society.


"Today we are going to appropriate 16 properties ... totaling
330,796 hectares and we will put them to use for livestock,"
Chavez said Sunday.


He said the land would be converted to farming cooperatives for
meat and dairy products.


The latest land grab brings to almost two million hectares the
land confiscated by the Venezuelan government since Chavez
assumed the presidency in 1999.


Chavez said during his weekly "Hello, Mr. President" broadcast
Sunday that he aims to do away with Venezuela's massive estates,
relics from colonial times, which he criticized as
underproductive and wasteful.


"How else will our country emerge from underdevelopment, if we
don't make full use of the land, and maximize its potential with
technology, resources and investment?" he said.


But he added that landowners who fully use their estates and
don't allow the ground to lie fallow "have no reason to fear"
similar confiscation of their property.
