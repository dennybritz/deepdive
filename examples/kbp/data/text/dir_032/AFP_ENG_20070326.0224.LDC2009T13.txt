Fifteen British navy personnel seized by Iran on Friday are
currently being interrogated and will have to answer to
allegations they violated Iranian waters, an Iranian official
said on Monday.


"The case of the Britons who violated Iranian territorial waters
is following the due legal process and they must answer for their
violation," deputy foreign minister Mehdi Mostafavi said, state
television reported.


His comments came as Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said
in Baghdad that the Britons were detained in Iraqi waters.


"The British sailors are currrently being interrogated and must
clarify whether they entered Iranian waters deliberately or by
mistake," the Iranian official said.


"When it becomes clear, a decision will be made," he added.
