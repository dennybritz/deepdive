England's Kevin Pietersen has replaced Australia's Michael Hussey
on top of the one-day international batting rankings, the ICC
announced on Monday.


The 26-year-old Pietersen has scored 121 runs at an average of
60.50 at the World Cup including half-centuries against New
Zealand and Kenya in Group C.


Pietersen is the first England player to top the rankings since
Marcus Trescothick did so for one match in 2005 and only the
third in history with Allan Lamb doing so back in 1989.


Hussey has dropped two places to third position while his captain
Ricky Ponting moves up to second.


"His average speaks for itself," said Pietersen's England
colleague Sajid Mahmood.


"When I bowl to him, I feel I can improve my game. You want the
best players in the nets and he tests you because of the strange
shots he pulls out of nowhere."


New Zealand seamer Shane Bond has climbed to second position in
the bowlers table for the first time, illustrating the good form
that the Black Caps are in at the World Cup.


Bond has moved up five places and is now level in second spot
with Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan who is up seven
places for his highest ranking for more than a year.


They are both, however, still a long way short of displacing
South Africa's Shaun Pollock at the top.


Pollock, who conceded over 80 runs off his 10 overs on Saturday
when South Africa were beaten by Australia, is still clear of
Bond and Muralitharan at the top of the rankings.
