After a six-week investigation, police said Smith, 39, who died
suddenly in a Florida hotel on February 8.


"We are convinced, based on an extensive review of the evidence,
that this case is an accidental overdose with no other criminal
element present," said Broward County police chief Charlie Tiger.


"We have reviewed hundreds of hours of video, tape captured by
the hotel security cameras and we found nothing unusual," he
said.
