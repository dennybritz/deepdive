German giants Bayern Munich confirmed Monday they are appealing
the one-match suspension imposed by European football's governing
body UEFA on goalkeeper Oliver Kahn.


Kahn was suspended for 'improper conduct" and also fined 20,000
Swiss francs (12,346 euros) Thursday for his part in a heated
argument with doping control officials following Bayern's 2-1 win
over Real Madrid in Munich two weeks ago.


The ban keeps the veteran out of his club's Champions League
quarter-final, first leg away to AC Milan on April 3.


"I have never heard of a player being hit with such a heavy
penalty for such an offence," said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.


Kahn had a heated argument with the doctor supervising the doping
controls after he requested that the goalkeeper provide another
sample because he had not been present when the first was taken.


Should Kahn's suspension be upheld, reserve Michael Rensing will
be in goal for the first leg, before Kahn returns for the home
leg at the Allianz Arena.
