An American civilian and two other foreigners were wounded on
Monday when the US embassy in Baghdad came under indirect fire, a
US military spokesman said.


"There was an indirect fire attack that impacted near the embassy
and one US civilian and two third country nationals were wounded.
They're being treated," Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver
told AFP.


They were hurt while in the vicinity of the embassy at the time
of the attack, Garver said. He could not confirm whether the
American or the other two people were embassy employees.


A second bout of indirect fire near the embassy took place later
but caused no casualties. A US official told AFP there was "no
significant damage" to the embassy building.


US embassy spokesman Lou Fintor confirmed only that there were
two explosions in the highly fortified Green Zone, home to the
embassy, but made no comment on casualties.


"At approximately 4:20 pm Baghdad local time there was an
explosion in the international zone. Preliminary reports indicate
it was a rocket. There are no casualties reported. Damage was
minimal," he said.


The attack came just hours after outgoing US ambassador Zalmay
Khalilzad gave a farewell news conference following a 21-month
posting to Baghdad.
