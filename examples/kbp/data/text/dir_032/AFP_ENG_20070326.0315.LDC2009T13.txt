A Turkish prosecutor launched a formal investigation Monday into
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan over allegations he praised
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan seven years ago, a report
said.


The probe follows complaints filed by the main opposition
Republican People's Party (CHP) and several individuals that
Erdogan referred to Ocalan as "sayin" -- a word meaning esteemed
or honorable, but which also doubles for "mister" -- during a
radio interview in Australia in January 2000.


Erdogan has categorically rejected the allegations which were
first brought up by the CHP last week.


The prosecutor in charge of the probe will decide whether there
is need for a full judicial investigation against Erdogan that
could pave the way for charges against him, the Anatolia news
agency reported.


He would have to ask parliament for permission to carry out such
an investigation since Erdogan has political immunity.


Under the Turkish penal code, praising a crime or criminal
offender is punishable by up to two years in prison.


Several politicians from the country's main Kurdish party have
been indicted or jailed on these charges for referring to Ocalan
as "sayin".


Ocalan is the head of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has
fought for Kurdish self-rule in the southeast since 1984 in a
conflict that has claimed more than 37,000 lives.


Considered by many Turks as the country's main enemy, he has been
serving a life sentence for treason and separatism as the sole
inmate on a prison island since he was convicted in 1999.
