Comic-book hero Asterix did his bit for Middle East peace this
weekend, when Arab and Hebrew translations of an Asterix album
with a Middle Eastern touch were released simultaneously at the
Paris book fair.


"Translation opens us up to others, to all peoples," said Syrian
Jamal Shehayeb, who usually translates literary works by Proust
or poet Lamartine.


In the books, the diminutive Gallic warrior's friends "live in
peace and friendship with all other people as long as nobody
bothers them", said Israeli Dorith Daliot Rubinovitz, who
generally translates French novelist Maupassant.


The translated comic book album is titled in French "Asterix chez
Rahazade" (Asterix at Rahazade's) and refers to the 1001 Arabian
Nights.


Both translators said they had had to adapt the text to reality,
but had decided to keep the wild boars that people the albums
despite religious objections to pork.


"We left the boars in though they're not kosher," said the
Israeli translator.


Syrian Shehayeb said an earlier Asterix album translated into
Arabic had used "wild beasts" rather than "boars" to avoid
offending fundamentalists. "I kept the original because you have
to face reality as it is," he said.


Since he came to life in 1959, Asterix has been translated into
107 languages and dialects.
