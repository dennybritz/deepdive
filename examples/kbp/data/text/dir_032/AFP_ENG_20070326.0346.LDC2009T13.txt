German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom said Monday it
had agreed to sell five call centres to German media giant
Bertelsmann for an undisclosed sum.


Under the terms of the deal, 1,100 Deutsche Telekom employees
would be taken over by Arvato, the communiciations services arm
of Bertelsmann, with effect from May 1, Deutsche Telekom said in
a statement.


Arvato had agreed to guarantee the jobs until 2008, the statement
added.


The five call centres are situated in Rostock, Neubrandenburg,
Potsdam, Erfurt and Stuttgart.


Press reports have put the price of the deal at several hundreds
of millions of euros (dollars).


The sale is part of Deutsche Telekom's strategy to spin off about
50,000 jobs, primarily in its maintenance and services
activities.
