Violence, red tape and poor access are jeopardising international
relief operations in Sudan's war-torn Darfur region, UN
humanitarian chief John Holmes said on Monday.


"If we don't deal with those problems, (the) humanitarian effort
could begin to unravel with catastrophic effects for the civilian
population," he told a news conference.


Holmes, wrapping up his first visit to Sudan, drew up a long list
of obstacles hindering what is considered to be the world's
largest ongoing humanitarian operation.


The Sudanese military blocked him from entering a camp for
displaced people in Darfur on Saturday, in an incident he called
symptomatic of the problems aid organisations face in the area.


According to the United Nations, at least 200,000 people have
been killed and more than two million displaced in Darfur since
the conflict erupted in February 2003. Some sources say the death
toll is much higher.


President Omar al-Beshir, who has consistently rejected a UN
peacekeeping deployment in Darfur, is expected to meet UN
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's
Arab summit in Riyadh.


British diplomat Holmes, who succeeded Norway's Jan Egeland on
March 1, heads on Tuesday to Chad and the Central African
Republic, two countries which have suffered from a spillover of
the Darfur conflict.
