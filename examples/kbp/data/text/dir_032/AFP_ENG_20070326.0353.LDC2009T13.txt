UN chief mediator Martti Ahtisaari, in a report released here
Monday, recommended that the Serbian province of Kosovo be
granted independence under initial international supervision.


"Independence is the only option for a politically stable and
economically viable Kosovo," Ahtisaari said.


"I therefore propose that the exercise of Kosovo's independence
... be supervised and supported for an initial period by
international civilian and military presences."
