A French and a British student, both Muslims, were killed in an
attack by Shiite rebels on a Sunni Islamic college in a restive
region of Yemen, a tribal source said on Monday.


An Algerian student was also wounded in the attack which took
place on Sunday, in the northern province of Saada, where Zaidi
minority rebels are fighting government forces, the source told
AFP requesting anonymity.


He said that the students were part of a group who were guarding
the school at night.


The British and French embassies in Sanaa were not immediately
available for comment.


Dozens of foreign students attend the school for Islamic studies
at Dammaj, which is run by a Sunni Salafist group, the source
added.


Sunni Salifists consider Shiite Muslims as heretics.


The Zaidis are an offshoot of Shiite Islam dominant in
northwestern Yemen but form a minority in the mainly Sunni
country. They began fighting government forces in 2004, since
when hundreds have been killed.


The rebellion -- which the government claimed to have crushed in
April 2005 -- flared up again in January following a presidential
ultimatum for the rebels to disarm.


The rebels reject as illegitimate the current Yemeni authorities
who seized power in a 1962 coup known as the September 26
revolution, overthrowing a Zaidi imamate.
