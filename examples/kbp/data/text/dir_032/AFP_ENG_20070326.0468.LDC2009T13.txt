Russia and China urged a "peaceful" solution on Monday to the
dispute over Iran's nuclear programme in a declaration signed by
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao
in Moscow.


"Russia and China emphasise that the problem of Iran's nuclear
programme should be resolved exclusively in a peaceful way,
through negotiations," the declaration signed by the two
presidents said.


The United States charges that Iran's nuclear energy programme is
a cover for secretly developing nuclear weapons and has not ruled
out military action to prevent this.


Iran insists its programme is aimed exclusive at producing
nuclear energy.


"Russia and China will make every effort to ensure the rapid
start of negotiations to find a long-term, all-encompassing and
mutually acceptable resolution to the Iranian nuclear problem,"
the declaration said.


The Russian and Chinese presidents also said in their declaration
that "Iran has a right to peaceful nuclear energy, in accordance
with the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty."


The UN Security Council imposed new sanctions against Iran on
Saturday over its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment. Iran
responded Sunday by saying it would limit cooperation with the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
