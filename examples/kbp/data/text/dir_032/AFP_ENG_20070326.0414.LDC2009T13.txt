The head of euro group of finance ministers was coy Monday about
whether the yen exchange rate should be mentioned in the
conclusions of the next G7 meeting, saying it should be
considered "carefully."


When asked if European finance ministers should press for the
question of the weak yen to be broached, Luxembourg Finance
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker told journalists: "We have to
consider this carefully."


"We are sticking to what we have said in Essen," he added,
referring to the last meeting of finance chiefs from the Group of
Seven richest countries in central Germany in February.


G7 opted for a relatively soft line on the sliding Japanese yen
at that meeting, despite European pressure about the currency's
weakness, which Juncker had spoken out against because it hurts
eurozone exports.


However, Juncker refused to be drawn on whether European finance
chiefs would seek a harder line on the yen, which has recovered
somewhat since the February meeting, when the G7 meets in
Washington in mid-April.


"I dont think that public pre-announcements could and would be
helpful," he said as he arrived to chair a regular meeting of
eurozone finance ministers.
