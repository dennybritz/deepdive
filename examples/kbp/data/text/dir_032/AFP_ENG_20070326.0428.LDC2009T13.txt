Three Canadian tourists headed to a national park in Kenya died
Monday when their van collided with a lorry, police said.


The three -- whose identities were not released -- were in a
group of six travelling by road to Samburu National Park, about
230 kilometres (143 miles) northeast of the capital Nairobi, said
top police official Tom Mutisya.


Two of the tourists died immediately while the third passed away
in a nearby missionary hospital near the foot of mount Kenya, he
added.


Road accidents are frequent in the east African nation, home to
at least 32 million people, where traffic regulations are
routinely violated or ignored and road conditions often poor.
