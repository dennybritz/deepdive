The Austrian football league slapped Graz AK and Sturm Graz on
Monday with massive point deductions, relegating the two teams
from southern Styria to the bottom of the league table.


Each team saw 10 points taken off its overall score as a result
of their filing for bankruptcy and their "failure therefore to
fulfill corresponding criteria."


Bottom-of-the-table Graz AK, which was Austrian champion in 2004,
had another 12 points deducted for infractions in the procedure
to acquire a league licence.


Sturm AK already had three points deducted at the beginning of
the season for the same reason. Earlier this month, FIFA imposed
a six-point penalty on Graz AK for failing to follow its
instruction to compensate a former player.


Sturm Graz is now ninth in the Austrian league table with 19
points, ahead of Graz AK, which now faces relegation with -1
point. They have 10 days to appeal their sanctions.


Following are the revised standings after 25 matches:


1. Salzburg 54, 2. Mattersburg 38, 3. Pasching 35, 4. Ried 32, 5.
Rapid Vienna 32, 6. Austria Vienna 31, 7. FC Tyrol 30, 8. Altach
27, 9. Sturm Graz 19, 10. Graz AK -1
