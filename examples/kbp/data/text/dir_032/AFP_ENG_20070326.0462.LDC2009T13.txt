Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders on Monday welcomed a UN plan to
grant Kosovo conditional independence, saying it was a "historic
day" for its people.


"It is a historic day for Kosovo," President Fatmir Sejdiu said
in a statement, adding the proposal would resolve the last
remaining unsolved issue in the war- torn Balkans region.


"I want to stress that Kosovo's independence would serve all the
citizens of the country, the Albanian majority and all the
minority communities in Kosovo as well."


In a document presented to the UN Security Council on Monday,
special UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari recommended Kosovo be granted
independence under international supervision.


In a public radio address, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian prime
minister, Agim Ceku, said now it was up to the local leadership
"to make Kosovo a better place for all."


He said he expected those who opposed the plan to understand that
Ahtisaari's recommendation was "the only realistic option, the
only practical solution."


"I expect unity of the United Nations and completion of Kosovo's
historic chapter."


Kosovo has been run by a United Nations mission since its
1998-1999 war between Serb and ethnic Albanian forces.


The current head of the mission, Joachim Ruecker, said he was
satisfied with the proposal.


"The transmission of the clear and unambiguous recommendation and
of the comprehensive proposal, with full support of the UN
secretary general, is no less than a historic moment for all the
people of Kosovo," said Ruecker.
