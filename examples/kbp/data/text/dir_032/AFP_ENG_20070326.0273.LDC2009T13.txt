The health of Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi, who
was rushed to intensive care and underwent surgery after a double
bomb attack, has significantly improved, his office said Monday.


"Zubayi's health condition has seen drastic improvement and the
deputy prime minister will leave hospital shortly," announced a
statement, providing no further details on his condition.


Zubayi, a moderate Sunni Muslim and one of two deputy prime
ministers in the Shiite-led government, was rushed to a US combat
hospital in Baghdad following a two-pronged assassination bid
inside his personal compound last Friday.


Iraqi officials said he underwent surgery to remove shrapnel from
his chest and was treated in intensive care after a suicide
bomber, believed to have been one of Zubayi's guards, blew
himself up while the minster was praying.


Just moments after the first explosion, a car bomb exploded
within Zubayi's home, office and mosque compound in central
Baghdad that killed nine people and which Iraqi officials said
was an inside job.
