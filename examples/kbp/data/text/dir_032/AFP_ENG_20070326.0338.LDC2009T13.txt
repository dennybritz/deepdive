A gas explosion in a Siberian coal mine that killed 108 people
last week was due to "serious breaches" of safety rules, Russia's
industrial safety agency said on Monday.


"A preliminary inquiry into the causes of the accident in the
Ulyanovskaya mine in Kemerovo region showed serious breaches in
safety regulations," the agency, Rostekhnadzor, said in a
statement.


The statement did not add further details on the nature of the
breaches but said that under Russian law the owners of the mine
were responsible for any violations during production.


The Ulyanovskaya mine where Russia's deadliest mining accident
occurred was operated by Yuzhkuzbassugol, a company owned by the
Evraz metals giant in which Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich
holds a 41-percent stake.
