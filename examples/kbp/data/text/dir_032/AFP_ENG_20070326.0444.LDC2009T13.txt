A woman injured in the 2004 Madrid bombings was barred from the
court trying suspects in the attack Monday after the judge
spotted her wearing a t-shirt with a caricature of the Prophet
Mohammed.


The woman, a member of one of the victims' associations
represented at the trial, was seated in the front row of the
public gallery, next to the space where the defendants stood
behind bullet-proof glass.


When she got up to leave the court during a recess the judge
noticed the cartoon, which showed the Muslim prophet wearing a
turban shaped as a bomb. The same cartoon sparked fury in the
Islamic world in 2005 when it was printed in a Dutch newspaper.


Tribunal president Javier Gomez Bermudez ordered police to
identify her and bar her from the courtroom.


The shirt was not illegal in Spain but the judge found it
inappropriate dress for the courtroom, a judicial source told
AFP.


The woman was subsequently seen by one of the psychologists
counselling victims of the March 2004 attacks, which killed 191
people and wounded 1,824.


A total of 29 defendants are on trial for the country's worst
terror attack, for which Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility.


Those on trial, mainly Moroccans living in Madrid, deny any part
in the bombings.
