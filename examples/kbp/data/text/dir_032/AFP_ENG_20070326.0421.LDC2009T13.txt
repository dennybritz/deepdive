The Rhine river, Europe's main east-west inland waterway, is
likely to be blocked until Friday after shipping containers fell
off a barge, officials said on Monday.


Some 31 containers slid into the Rhine from the ship as it
attempted to negotiate a sharp turn in the river on Sunday.


Toxic chemicals were inside three of the containers, one of which
officials were still trying to locate on Monday, although there
was no sign that the contents had leaked into the river.


Television pictures showed some of the containers protruding
above the water.


Seventeen containers were found within hours, but contractors
with floating cranes were attempting to retrieve the rest.


Officials said it was too dangerous to let other ships sail past
the submerged cargo.


"We can only hope that the remaining containers are found
quickly," said Jens Schwanen, the head of the German inland water
authorities.


The Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam in the
Netherlands and is connected by canal to the Danube river, which
empties into the Black Sea.
