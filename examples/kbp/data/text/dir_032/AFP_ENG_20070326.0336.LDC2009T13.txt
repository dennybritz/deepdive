US shares opened mixed Monday as investors awaited a fresh update
on new home sales which is due to be released later this morning.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.48 points (0.02
percent) at 12,478.53, in initial trades after the opening bell.


The Nasdaq composite had gained 2.76 points (0.11 percent) to
2,451.69 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 was up
0.33 points (0.02 percent) at 1,436.44.


Most analysts expect the government to announce that new home
sales rose in February to an annualized 995,000 units from
937,000 in the prior month.


"The new home sector is in worse shape than the market for
existing homes. However, an increase in new homes sales is
expected," said Dick Green, a president at Briefing.com.


"We expect the housing sector to remain sluggish for quite a
while," Green said.


Traders meanwhile said that soaring oil prices, linked to
geopolitical concerns related to Iran, could pressure shares.
