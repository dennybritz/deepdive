Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila said Monday
that "order had to be restored at any cost," to end deadly
clashes between the army and militia loyal to former vice
president Jean-Pierre Bemba.


Warning that Bemba's fighters had been intent on seizing control
of the capital, Kinsasha, Kabila said the dispute was military
rather than political.


"Order had to be restored at any cost," he told reporters at his
presidential palace in his first statement since the two days of
fighting last week.


"You do not guarantee security through negotiation," he added, in
an apparent response to calls from the United Nations, the
African Union and various countries for a dialogue between the
two sides.


About 2,000 troops fought Bemba's 700 fighters in the Gombe
district of the capital on Thursday and Friday, leaving 120 dead
and 150 seriously wounded, according to aid group estimates.


Bemba, who lost the presidential election in October to Kabila,
has refused to have his vice-presidential bodyguard integrated
into the regular army, arguing that his personal security could
not be guaranteed.


The former rebel leader took refuge in the South African embassy
in Kinshasa on Thursday.
