The United States on Monday applauded a deal struck overnight
that will allow Northern Ireland to restore self-rule after
landmark talks between longtime rival Catholic and Protestant
leaders.


"This was an historic meeting," said State Department spokesman
Tom Casey of the unprecedented face-to-face talks between Ian
Paisley, firebrand leader of the Protestant Democratic Unionist
Party, and Gerry Adams, head of mainly Catholic Sinn Fein.


"Our understanding is that they have actually reached an
agreement that will allow for the government to stand up and not
require a return for direct rule from Britain," Casey said.


"It is certainly a very positive step and one that moves the
process forward. We welcome it and certainly hope to see that
agreement now implemented."


The pair met hours before a midnight (2300 GMT) deadline set by
the Irish and British governments for a deal to share power and
restore self-rule in Northern Ireland following a five-year
suspension.


The two leaders agreed in principle for the deal to take effect
on May 8.
