Arab foreign ministers agreed on Monday to call for an amendment
of Iraq's constitution to give Sunni Arabs a greater share of
power in the war-ravaged country.


"The ministers approved a call to Iraq to amend its constitution
in order to boost the political process in that country," one of
the ministers told AFP, requesting anonymity.


Arab states preparing for a summit in Riyadh on Wednesday want to
see the consitution changed to give Sunnis a greater share of
political power and avoid a federal split of Iraq, the minister
said.


Iraq's once-ruling Sunni Arabs want an amendment of the
constitution adopted in October 2005, fearing that the
arrangement leaves their central regions without natural
resources and Iraq's oil wealth in the hands of the governing
Shiites and the autonomous Kurds.


Their demand is backed by Sunni-dominated Arab countries,
including Saudi Arabia which is hosting the summit opening on
Wednesday.


The Arab top diplomats also called for "reviewing the de-
Baathification law in order to enhance the national
reconciliation process in Iraq," the minister said.


Tens of thousands of former members of Iraq's former ruling Baath
party were stripped of their positions in government,
universities and companies in the aftermath of the 2003 US-led
invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.


The law of de-Baathification has been a major grievance of the
minority Sunnis.
