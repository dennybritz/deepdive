An Indian court on Monday handed down the death sentence to a
petrol station owner for murdering an oil firm executive who
exposed a fuel sale racket, the Press Trust of India said.


The court in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh had found Monu
Mittal guilty of the November 2005 murder of 27-year-old Indian
Oil Corp. (IOC) executive S. Manjunath.


Manjnunath was shot dead after he threatened to cancel Mittal's
IOC licence for selling adulterated fuel, PTI said.


The murder had become a focal point for campaigners fighting
rampant corruption in India's petroleum sector.


District judge S.M.A. Abidi also handed down life terms to seven
others involved in the murder, the news agency said. Mittal's
death sentence is subject to confirmation by a higher court.


Capital punishment is not handed out frequently in India and
actual executions are even more rare, as death row convicts have
various legal options to delay or stave off a hanging.
