One of the world's top upcoming rock groups, Arcade Fire from
Canada, on Monday cancelled the remainder of its European tour
this month and next to allow singer Win Butler to undergo sinus
surgery.


"Last night I kept yelling at the monitor guy because I didn't
recognise the sound that was coming out of the monitor as my own
voice," Butler said in a statement posted on the group's Internet
site. "Today I can barely speak, or make any sound, so finishing
the shows is no longer possible."


"For my own health and safety I need to have sinus surgery."


The group began the tour dedicated to its second album "Neon
Bible" in Dublin early this month but had to cancel concerts on
Saturday in Oslo and Copenhagen on Sunday due to the singer's
problems with his voice.


Arcade Fire had been scheduled to play in Berlin (Tuesday),
Munich (Wednesday), Lyon (Saturday), Cologne (Sunday), Utrecht
(April 2), Brussels (April 4) and Lille (April 5).


After the European leg, the group is scheduled to tour the United
States and Canada and return to Europe for some of the big summer
festivals.
