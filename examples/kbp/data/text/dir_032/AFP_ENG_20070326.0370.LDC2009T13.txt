French oil industry officials warned Monday of petrol shortages
from next week if there is no resolution to a strike by dockers
at the oil terminal in the Mediterrean port of Marseille.


Some 50 ships including 26 oil tankers were at anchor off the
port as the strike called by the CGT union went into its 13th
day.


"The lack of supplies means that some refineries are going to
start eating into reserves from this week and slowing down
production. The first problems for private consumers could appear
at the start of April," said Jean-Francois Cousinie, of the
French Union of Petroleum Industries.


The CGT launched the strike on March 14 to demand the recruitment
of port workers at a new gas terminal at Fos-sur-Mer. The energy
company GDF says that for safety reasons it will employ only its
own staff.
