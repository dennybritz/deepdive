Prosecutors in Milan on Monday sought a five-year prison sentence
for former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, accused of
bribing judges.


"Mr. Berlusconi was the driving force in this case," said
prosecutor Piero De Tetris, according to the ANSA news agency.


Berlusconi, accused of bribing judges to prevent the takeover of
food company SME by his business rival Carlo de Benedetti in
1985, benefitted from attenuating circumstances when he was
acquitted in December 2004.


The tribunal was expected to reach a verdict at the end of April.


If convicted in the Milan appeal, Italy's richest man could still
take the case to a higher court.


Several other people including judges and Cesare Previti,
Berlusconi's former lawyer who entered politics in the 1990s,
have already been convicted in the case.


Berlusconi was tried separately from his co-defendants due to his
engagements as prime minister and the case, which opened in 2003,
was suspended when the government passed a law granting temporary
immunity from prosecution to the five leading members of
government while in office.


The case was allowed to go forward after Italy's constitutional
court annuled the law.
