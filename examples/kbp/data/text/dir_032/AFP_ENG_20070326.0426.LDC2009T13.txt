Slovenia's central bank upgraded Monday its 2007 forecast for
economic growth in the country to 4.6 percent from a previous
estimate of 4.2 percent.


"There are still risks that could threaten rather favourable
economic growth such as the prices of labour, oil, and some state
services," Slovenian central bank governor Mitja Gaspari told
journalists.


In the last quarter of 2006 Slovenia posted 5.5 percent growth,
up from 3.7 percent in the last quarter of 2005.


The central bank nonetheless expects economic growth to slow over
the next two years, to 4.4 percent in 2008 and 4.0 percent in
2009.


Meanwhile, Gaspari said 12-month inflation in Slovenia would
remain stable this year and next at 2.7 percent before easing to
2.6 percent in 2009.


Consumer prices rose by 2.8 percent last year.


The Slovenian government has forecast 4.3 percent economic growth
for this year and expects inflation to reach 2.9 percent.


Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic that declared independence
in 1991, joined the European Union in 2004 and adopted the euro
in January.
