Fifteen British sailors detained last week by Iran were seized in
Iraqi not Iranian waters as maintained by Tehran, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Hoshyar Zebari said on Monday.


His ministry issued a statement after Zebari telephoned his
Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki late Sunday to urge Iran
to free the British navy personnel whom he said had been
operating in Iraqi waters.


"The minister stressed that they (the British naval personnel),
according to Iraqi authorities' information, were detained inside
Iraqi territorial waters," the statement said.


"They are part of the multinational forces (based in Iraq) with
the approval of the Iraqi government and in accordance with the
relevant UN Security Council resolution," it added.


"The minister demanded that they be released and the issue be
tackled wisely."


British ministers and commanders have been adamant that the
sailors and marines were operating in Iraqi waters.


"We believe that they definitely were operating in Iraqi waters,"
Major David Gell told AFP from Iraq's main southern city of
Basra.


Tehran stuck to its stand on Monday that the Britons had violated
Iranian waters and said it was interrogating them.


"The British sailors are currently being interrogated and must
clarify whether they entered Iranian waters deliberately or by
mistake," deputy foreign minister Mehdi Mostafavi said, state
television reported.


"When it becomes clear, a decision will be made," he added.
