Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf has denied the
Pakistan cricket team were involved in any kind of match-fixing
or corruption, Sky Sports website reported on Monday, as the Bob
Woolmer murder investigation continued.


Investigators are studying videos from the hotel in Kingston,
Jamaica, where Pakistan coach Woolmer, 58, and the rest of the
Pakistan team were staying at the time of his murder on March 18.


Police say Woolmer was strangled in his room, a day after World
Cup minnows Ireland stunningly knocked Pakistan out of a
competition they had won in 1992.


Ashraf told Sky Sports: "I am absolutely convinced, I have no
information or proof that there is any corruption in Pakistani
cricket at all.


"There is no idea or anything of that nature to suggest that
there is any corruption involved or any match-fixing linked to
the Pakistani cricket team.


"This has been a terrible ordeal, the boys have been through
terrible stress. No-one could have imagined that in a gentleman's
came like cricket things like murder could happen so it's been a
tremendous shock for all of us.


"We have been the victims of this dastardly crime - our boys have
been through hell - so it's vital that whoever is responsible is
brought to book.


"Our boys are on their way home to be with their families - you
can imagine what their families have been going through."


Nasim Ashraf also revealed that Woolmer had decided to retire
from coaching following the World Cup but that he would remain in
the sport at a grass roots level.
