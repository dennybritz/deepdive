At least 100 people are dead or missing after smugglers
brandishing knives forced hundreds of Somalis and Ethiopians into
high seas off the coast of Yemen, the UN refugee agency said
Monday.


"We are horrified by this latest tragedy," said UNHCR's Assistant
High Commissioner for Protection Erika Feller after returning
from a five-day visit to Yemen to review the agency's operations
there.


"These brutal smugglers care nothing about the fate of the people
they prey upon, both refugees and irregular migrants who are
desperate to escape persecution, violence and poverty in the Horn
of Africa."


Twenty-nine people were confirmed dead and 71 others were missing
after the incident last Thursday when 450 Somalis and Ethiopians
were forced to jump into the stormy seas off a remote stretch of
Yemen's coastline, the UNHCR said.


It brings the total number of dead and missing refugees so far
this year in Yemen to 262, the UN agency said.
