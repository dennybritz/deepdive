Singapore motorists will soon be able to drive with number plates
sporting personalised messages, officials confirmed Monday.


The Land Transport Authority (LTA) told AFP it was still working
out details of the scheme and had not decided on an
implementation date.


Vanity plates, as they are also known, are common in North
America.


"LTA has been working with the motor trade industry and other
external parties to make the necessary changes to their systems
to allow the use of personalised numbers on vehicles," said
Naleeza Ebrahim, the LTA's spokesperson.


Plates with offensive or sensitive messages were unlikely to be
allowed, The Straits Times newspaper said.


It said the LTA had previously banned the use of vowels in number
plates, but the LTA declined to comment when questioned by AFP.
