The Hungarian central bank left its main interest rate unchanged
at 8.0 percent Monday and said the forint would not fluctuate
outside its target range.


"We have the ability to keep the forint in the target range," the
bank's new president, Andras Simor, said after a meeting of the
institution's monetary council.


There had been speculation that the forint could flare in value,
along with other central European currencies.


The forint has risen since politcal unrest in Hungary dropped it
to 277 forints to the euro in September. It is now exchanged at
247.43 forints to the euro, near the top of the target range that
has been in effect since June 2003.


The band has a trading range of 240.01 to 324.71 forints per
euro, which gives a median rate of 282.36 forints.
