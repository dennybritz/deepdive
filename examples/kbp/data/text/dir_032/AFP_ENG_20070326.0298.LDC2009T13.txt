Former cabinet minister Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi has won
Mauritania's presidential election, with nearly 53 percent of
votes from the second-round ballot, the ministry of the interior
announced Monday.


The 69-year-old will be the northwestern African country's first
democratically elected president since independence from France
in 1960.


"I hereby proclaim that the next president of the Islamic
Republic of Mauritania will be Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi,"
Interior Minister Mohamed Ahmed Ould Mohamed Lemine told
reporters.


Ould Abdallahi won 52.85 percent of the vote, while his opponent,
Ahmed Ould Daddah, received 47.15 percent.
