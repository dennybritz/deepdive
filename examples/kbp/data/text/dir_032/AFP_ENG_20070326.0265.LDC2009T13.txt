A flash flood in southwestern Afghanistan killed six family
members, an official said Monday as the UN said seasonal flooding
had affected about 20,000 people across the country.


The weekend flood in the province of Nimroz damaged or destroyed
homes in about 49 villages and affected 12,000 people, the deputy
provincial governor Waheedullah Khirzad told AFP.


Many animals had been killed, Khirzad said, warning of a
humanitarian disaster unless help arrived soon.


More than 30 people were killed in floods and avalanches in the
country last week, according to officials and reports. The winter
snows are melting off the mountains and there has been heavy
rainfall in many parts of the country.


The United Nations said meanwhile it was positioning essential
supplies, including food, for around 20,000 people in various
parts of the country who had been hit by floods.


Troops with the International Security Assistance Force last week
helped to airlift about 600 people from flooded villagers along
the Helmand River in the central province of Uruzgan.
