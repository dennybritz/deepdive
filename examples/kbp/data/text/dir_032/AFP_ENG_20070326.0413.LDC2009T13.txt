Italy coach Roberto Donadoni has called up a third keeper in
Morgan De Santis for their Euro 2008 Group B qualifier against
Scotland in Bari on Wednesday.


First-choice Gianluigi Buffon did not train on Monday as a
precaution because he has still not fully recovered from gastro-
enteritis.


Buffon may still play against the Scots but Donadoni decided to
call up a third keeper in Udinese keeper De Santis as cover and
he was expected to join their Coverciano training base in
Florence on Monday evening.


Chrstian Abbiati is the second-choice keeper.
