Who's saying what at the World Cup:


"When a man has been murdered, to divert a murder inquiry into a
match-fixing inquiry, that's not fair, because we have to find
the killers, then we will know what's happened."


- Pakistan team spokesman PJ Mir


"I know it is a different class of opponents in the game on
Tuesday, but we've played well against Australia in the recent
past and we expect to do well if we play to our strengths."


- Brian Lara looking ahead to the Super Eights opener against the
world champions in Antigua on Tuesday.


"It is very significant for us (to reach the Super Eights). We
had the potential to do well and we also needed a little bit of
luck to get results."


- Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore.


"Prices are high, but for cricket you have to pay."


- Charles Wilkins, the head of the local organising committee in
St Kitts, on the low crowds at the venue.


"That 1996 side was an amazing team. They just outplayed
everybody. They created new waves in one-day cricket. They did a
brilliant job. For us, it is all about just taking one game at a
time."


- Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jawayardene on comparisons with the
1996 World Cup winning team
