Steve Coppell has signed a two-year contract with Reading to
further his tenure at the Premiership club who have followed
promotion with a highly-successful campaign in the top flight.


Reading, who run their club on a shoestring compared to big clubs
such as Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal, are eighth in the
Premiership.


The move of signing a two-year deal breaks with Coppell's
previous preference of signing one-year rolling contracts with
the club.


Royals chairman John Madejski said: "We are highly delighted that
Steve has agreed this new contract.


"He is widely regarded as one of the most respected and
successful managers in football, and the fact that he has pledged
his future to Reading gives the players, staff and the whole club
a great deal of security for the next two years.


"Steve and I have an exceptionally good working relationship, and
I always had complete confidence that he would sign this
contract.


"He has obviously played a vital role in our success, so this is
a real red- letter day for the club and we look forward to
continuing to work together and taking Reading Football Club even
further."
