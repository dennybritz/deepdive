Jennifer Lopez' first Spanish language album, "Como ama una
mujer" (How a woman loves), is a "natural return to Latin roots",
the singer said in Paris ahead of the album's worldwide release
on Tuesday.


"I've always sung in this language so it was natural to record in
Spanish," said 37-year-old Lopez.


"I grew up with all types of music that my mother used to listen
to," said the US singer-actress, who is of Puerto Rican origin
but was born and grew up in the Bronx.


Lopez, in white platform shoes and hanging onto husband Marc
Anthony's arm, flew into Paris for a news conference ahead of the
March 27 release of her sixth album to date.


The album was produced by Colombian Julio Reyes and Anthony, who
she married in 2004.


"We have lots of fun working together, that's how we met 10 years
ago and we both respect each other's work," she said.


Next on her schedule are a new album in English, a European tour
of "Como ama une mujer" late this year, and a film with Antonio
Banderas about the murder of Mexican workers in the border town
of Juarez.
