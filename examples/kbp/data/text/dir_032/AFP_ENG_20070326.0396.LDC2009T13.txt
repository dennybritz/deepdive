Australia's Tony Smith was on Monday named as the supremo of the
Great Britain rugby league team, combining the role of coach and
performance director.


The 40-year-old Leeds head coach will take over the reins on a
part-time basis till his Leeds contract runs out at the end of
the season.


But he is expected to be in charge for the Test match against
France on the weekend of June 22 to 24 and will become full-time
national coach at the end of the season.


His first big challenge will come in the autumn when Britain take
on New Zealand in a three-match Test Series on home soil before
taking charge of England for the 2008 World Cup in Australia.


"It's a great honour to take on this role and one that I am
relishing," Smith told a news conference in Huddersfield. "This
country has some of the best young players in the world and my
job over the next two and a half years will be to develop this
crop of players into the best team in the world.


"I have thoroughly enjoyed my four seasons at Leeds and am proud
of what I have achieved there.


"Fans of the club can rest assured that I will continue to give
my all for the club until the end of the season, whilst at the
same time starting with the Great Britain set-up."
