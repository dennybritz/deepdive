Sri Lankan war planes carried out retaliatory attacks inside
rebel-held territory Monday after Tiger guerrillas staged their
first air raid against the military, the militants said.


Supersonic jets carried out four bombing raids over areas held by
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) after the night
attack by the guerrillas against the Katunayake airbase, the
group said.


In the Tiger attack, three Sri Lankan airmen were killed and 16
wounded.


The Tigers said the military's retaliatory strikes did not cause
any casualties.


"Sri Lankan air force MiG planes bombed civilian areas in Wanni
more than four times," the LTTE said in a statement.
"Fortunately, there are no casualties. Civilian properties and
farm lands were destroyed in the attack."


There was no immediate word from the military about the air
attacks.
