A Palestinian shepherd has been stabbed to death near a Jewish
settlement in the northern West Bank, Israeli and Palestinian
officials said Monday.


The body of Mohammed Bani Jaber, 51, from the village of Aqraba,
was found near a security fence surrounding the Itamar
settlement, southeast of the city of Nablus.


"We accuse the settlers of having killed him," said village mayor
Awdat Bani Jaber.


The shepherd, who often tended his flock near the settlement, had
been missing since Sunday night, the mayor said.


Israeli police said they had opened an investigation into his
murder.


"The body was found between two Palestinian villages and has been
transferred for an autopsy" to the Abu Kabir medical institute
near Tel Aviv, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP.
