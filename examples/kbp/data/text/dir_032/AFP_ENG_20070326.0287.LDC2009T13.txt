The Israeli military has carried out another successful test of
the Hetz (Arrow) anti-missile system, the defence ministry said
in a statement on Monday.


"The test succeeded perfectly, the data will be the object of
careful analysis by engineers," it said. "This marks an important
new step in developing our technological capabilities in the face
of a ballistic missile threat."


Israel has in recent years been concentrating efforts on
countering the threat of missile attacks from neighbouring Arab
states and arch-foe Iran, which has conducted several long-range
missile tests in recent years.


Previous Hetz tests have been designed to imitate the
interception of Iran's Shahab-3, which has a range sufficient to
reach Israel.


Israeli defence officials have said that the testing of the Hetz
system was intended as a message to arch-foe Iran.


"Last night's test is the answer to the advanced ballistic
missiles that Iran develops or buys," Deputy Defence Minister
Efraim Sneh said in February after a successful test.


"In the (armaments) race between Israel and Iran, Israel is ahead
at this stage," he added.


Last week Israel and the United States concluded a joint
computer-based exercise simulating a non-conventional missile
strike, which included another testing of the Hetz system.


The Hetz project was launched in 1988 at the initiative of
Israel's main ally the United States in the framework of its
"Star Wars" programme, which was officially abandoned in 1993.
