Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on Monday hailed a power-
sharing accord between Northern Ireland's rival leaders as
unprecedented, saying it could "transform the future of this
island."


"This morning saw unprecedented and very positive developments in
Northern Ireland," he said after the deal between Protestant
leader Ian Paisley and Catholic-backed Sinn Fein chief Gerry
Adams.


"We move forward from today in an entirely new spirit and with
every expectation of success," he added.


The two leaders, meeting hours ahead of a deadline set by London
and Dublin for a deal to restore self-rule five years after it
was suspended, agreed to resume power-sharing on May 8.


Paisley's Democratic Unionists (DUP) want Northern Ireland to
remain part of the United Kingdom, while Sinn Fein has long
pushed for the province to unite with the Republic of Ireland,
which forms the rest of the island of Ireland.


"This has the potential to transform the future of this island,"
said Ahern, confirming that he had discussed the latest
developments with his British counterpart Tony Blair.


"Through our partnership and cooperation we are determined to
ensure that the final steps of the peace process are successfully
completed," he said.
