The price of tin rose beyond 14,500 dollars a tonne in trading
here on Monday, the highest point since 1989 when the metal was
re-introduced on the London market.


A tonne of tin for delivery in three months climbed to 14,575
dollars on the London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's leading
market for metal futures.


The price of tin is surging on supply concerns from Indonesia,
where a government crackdown on illegal mining has slashed
production levels, and because of low inventories of the base
metal, according to traders.
