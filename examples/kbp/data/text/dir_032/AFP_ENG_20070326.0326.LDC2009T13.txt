French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy is to hold talks in
Paris next week with his Palestinian counterpart Ziad Abu Amr,
diplomats said Monday.


Abu Amr is an independent in the new unity government formed
earlier this month.


The lunch meeting on April 2 will be first for a Palestinian
foreign minister since the crisis provoked by the accession of
the Islamist group Hamas to power a year ago.
