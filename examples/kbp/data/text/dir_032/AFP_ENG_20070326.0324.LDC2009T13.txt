Two police officers died, one was injured and the detainee they
were escorting was also hurt when a warden opened fire from a
guard tower at a prison in central Poland, officials said Monday.


"Two police officers were killed instantly. Another was seriously
injured. The prisoner was also hurt," local police spokeswoman
Magdalena Zielinska told the news channel TVN24.


"After an exchange of fire, the warden was overpowered. He was
also injured," Zielinska added.


The 28-year-old warden opened fire from a tower at the entrance
of the prison in Sieradz, targeting the car carrying the police
officers and the detainee, who was been taken for a meeting with
investigators.


The warden then barricaded himself inside the tower. Police made
an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate before launching an assault.


It was not immediately clear what had motivated the attack.
