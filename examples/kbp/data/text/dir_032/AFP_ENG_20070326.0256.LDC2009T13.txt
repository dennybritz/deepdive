The European Commission called on the WTO Monday to referee a
dispute over India's duties on alcohol imports after talks
failed, taking a second step towards litigation.


The European Union's executive arm said it was asking the World
trade Organisation to set up a dispute settlement panel to rule
on India's import duties for spirits and wines, which can run as
high as 550 percent.


"As we could not resolve our dispute in consultations, the EU
sees no other way than to request the establishment of a WTO
panel," said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson.


"We are of course not closing the door to an amicable solution --
but the ball is now in India's court," he added.


In the first step towards litigation, the EU sought WTO
consultations with India on the matter in November, but those
talks proved fruitless.


The Commission began probing India duties on European wine and
spirits in September 2005 after receiving complaints from EU
producers, for whom India represents a potentially huge market.


In 2004, the then 25-nation EU's spirits exports to India
amounted to only 23.3 million euros (30.9 million dollars) while
wine exports the same year were worth around four million euros,
according to the EU's Eurostat data agency.


Those figures are a drop in the bucket compared to the five
billion euros in spirits the EU exports annually to other
countries and annual wine exports worth 4.5 billion euros.


The United States is also seeking WTO action against India over
alcohol duties.
