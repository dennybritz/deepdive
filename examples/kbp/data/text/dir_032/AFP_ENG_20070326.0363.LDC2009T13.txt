British rocker and famed showman Elton John celebrated his 60th
birthday Sunday with a huge concert and party at Madison Square
Garden with the likes of Bill Clinton, Whoopi Goldberg and Robin
Williams.


"Thank you for coming tonight to help celebrate Elton John
joining my favorite club -- the 60-year-olds," Clinton told the
crowd, according to John's website, as the singer performed his
60th concert at the venue.


"I love it every time he sings. He reminds me that we've still
got a little juice," he said.


The former president turned 60 in August.


John showcased some of his biggest hits, including "Rocket Man,"
"Crocodile Rock," "Daniel" and "Your Song," which he dedicated to
the city of New York.


He also took the opportunity to pay homage to his fellow Briton
John Lennon, who was killed in New York in 1980, with a rendition
of "Empty Garden."


John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on March 25, 1947 in
Pinner, north of London, and in 1969 released his first solo
album, "Empty Sky."


He has since released some 40 original albums.
