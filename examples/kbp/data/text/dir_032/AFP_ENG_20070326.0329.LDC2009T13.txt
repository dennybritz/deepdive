Indian writer and diplomat Vikas Swarup has won the Paris book
fair's Reader's Prize for his 2005 bestseller "Q&A", a debut
novel about a young waiter winning a TV quiz show.


Readers in some 400 French bookshops were asked to pick their
favourite  book among a selection of 15 by writers from India,
which is the special focus of this year's five-day fair ending
Tuesday. The fair last year attracted 174,000 visitors.


Swarup's book about an 18-year-old winning TV show "Who Will Win
A Billion" won him instant success, with film rights sold and
translations into 14 languages.


The Paris book fair has invited some 30 Indian novelists, both
from the diaspora and India, to take part in talks on Indian
literature during the fair.
