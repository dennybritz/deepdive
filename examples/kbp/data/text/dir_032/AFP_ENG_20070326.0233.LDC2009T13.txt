Northern Ireland's rival party leaders agreed Monday to restore
self-rule in Belfast on May 8, Democratic Unionist (DUP) leader
Ian Paisley said, hailing an "enormous opportunity."


Paisley and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams are to hold "regular"
talks between now and then, said Paisley, after the pair held
their first-ever face-to-face talks hours ahead of a midnight
(2300 GMT) deadline for a power-sharing deal.


Adams, sitting a few feet away from Paisley, said in a separate
statement afterwards that the accord "marks the beginning of a
new era of politics on this island."


The two men did not shake hands for the cameras.
