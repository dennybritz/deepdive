Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir is due to meet UN chief Ban Ki-
moon in Riyadh on Tuesday to discuss the Darfur conflict, in the
face of Khartoum's continued defiance of international demands.


Beshir has consistently rejected UN plans to deploy a
peacekeeping force in Darfur and refused to turn over war crimes
suspects to the International Criminal Court.


An Arab League official said on Monday the Riyadh talks would
also be attended by Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, Arab League
chief Amr Mussa and the head of the African Union's executive arm
Alpha Oumar Konare.


According to the United Nations, at least 200,00O people have
died and more than two million been displaced since the conflict
between rebels and government forces erupted in Darfur in
February 2003. Some sources say the death toll is much higher.
