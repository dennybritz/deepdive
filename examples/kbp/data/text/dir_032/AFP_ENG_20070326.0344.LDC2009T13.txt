Pakistani authorities and tribal elders signed a peace deal
Monday with pro- Taliban militants in a troubled region bordering
Afghanistan, officials and witnesses said.


The deal was signed in Bajaur, one of Pakistan's seven federally
administered tribal areas, where Al-Qaeda number two Ayman al-
Zawahiri escaped an airstrike in January 2006.


The tribesmen and militants agreed not to give foreign militants
safe haven in the area or allow "subversive" activities, while
the authorities pledged not to make arrests without consulting
the elders, they said.
