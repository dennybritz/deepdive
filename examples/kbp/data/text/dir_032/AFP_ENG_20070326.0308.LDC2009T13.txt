War-weary residents in Indian Kashmir can go water skiing and
kayaking from next month with authorities set to reopen the
region's only watersports centre, officials said Monday.


The centre, situated on the shores of Srinagar's Dal lake and
flanked by snow- capped Himalayan peaks, has been closed after an
insurgency against Indian rule began in 1989 -- although recent
years have seen a relative drop in violence.


"The water sports centre will be made functional by the end of
April this year," Dilawar Mir, the region's tourism minister,
said in a statement.


Para-sailing, kayaking, canoeing and waterskiing would be the
main attractions for tourists and locals, Mir said, adding
various boats and life jackets had already been acquired.


Authorities also have plans for a similar centre at Manasbal
lake, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Srinagar.


Last year nearly 400,000 tourists, mainly Indian, visited Kashmir
despite the violence, which included several grenade attacks
against visitors.


The rebels, meanwhile, insist that tourists are welcome in the
region.


The main tourist season starts in mid-April. Indian Kashmir has
been building up a reputation as one of the world's top winter
destinations for extreme skiers.
