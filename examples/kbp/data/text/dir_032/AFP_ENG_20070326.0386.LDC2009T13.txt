Finnish telecommunications equipment maker Nokia said on Monday
it is to build a plant in Romania to make mobile phones for
markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.


The 60-million-euro (80-million-dollar) factory is to employ 500
workers and be located in the northwestern city of Cluj, Nokia
said.


"Nokia selected Cluj as the location for the plant because of the
county's availability of skilled labour, its good inbound and
outbound logistics connections, its overall efficiency, and the
long industrial tradition in the area," a statement said.


Work on the factory is to begin shortly, with initial deliveries
forecast for the first half of 2008.


"As part of the plans, Nokia is looking to establish an
industrial village in the area, enabling a number of key
suppliers and partners to locate their operations there," the
company said.


The Finnish mobile phone maker also has production sites in
Brazil, Britain, China, Germany, Finland, India, Mexico and South
Korea.


Last year it employed 65,000 people worldwide and posted net
profit of 4.3 billion euros on sales of 41.1 billion.


"The decision to establish a new factory in Romania is a
reflection of Nokia's strong volume growth globally, as well as
the increasing demand for mobile devices in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa," the statement said.
