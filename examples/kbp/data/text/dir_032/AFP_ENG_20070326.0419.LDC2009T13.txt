Italian industrialist Diego Della Valle testified Monday in a
scandal involving photographs used to blackmail a number of
celebrities.


The boss of Florence's football club and Tod's Shoes appeared as
an "informed person" at a court in southern Potenza, the ANSA
news agency reported.


The entrepreneur admitted last week that he bought photographs to
prevent them from being published, while denying that they were
compromising.


Earlier, press reports said French Juventus striker David
Trezeguet told the court he had paid 25,000 euros (33,000
dollars) for photos showing him leaving a discotheque. He also
said the photos were not troubling.


The scandal emerged on March 12 with the arrest of several people
including a "paparazzo", Fabrizio Corona, suspected of
blackmailing celebrities with embarrassing photos.


It took a political turn when a right-wing newspaper, Il
Giornale, revealed the existence of a photograph showing a
spokesman of the centre-left government, Silvio Sircana, speaking
to a transsexual prostitute from his car.


A few days later Sircana demanded that the photos be published
and refused to resign from his job, saying the pictures proved
nothing more than "an evening's foolishness".


Media reports at the weekend spoke of a politician caught on film
handing around cocaine on a yacht near Capri.
