The White House on Monday said it was disappointed by Iran's
threat to limit cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog agency
and expressed hopes for a "solution" to the atomic standoff with
Tehran.


"Considering the international community is united in its desire
to work with Iran on a solution, their comments are
disappointing," national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe said
by electronic mail.


Johndroe was responding to an Iranian government spokesman's
announcement that Tehran would restrict cooperation with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in retaliation for the
UN Security Council sanctions imposed on Saturday over its
disputed atomic program.
