British Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed a historic power-sharing
accord struck by Northern Ireland's rival two main parties Monday
as "a very important day" for the province.


"This is a very important day for the people of Northern Ireland
but also for the people and the history of these islands," he
said of the deal between Democratic Unionist (DUP) leader Ian
Paisley and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.


"Everything we have done over the last 10 years has been a
preparation for this moment," said Blair, who has been battling
to strike an accord over Northern Ireland before leaving office
by September.
