German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck on Monday shrugged off
the recent strength of the euro against the dollar, saying that
the shared European currency had risen even higher in the past.


"I'm not worried by the strength of the euro," Steinbrueck said
as he arrived for a regular meeting of eurozone finance
ministers.


"The euro was as high as 1.36 against the dollar some time ago,
why should we worry about 1.33," he added.


The euro rose to its highest level since March 2005 against the
dollar last Thursday, reaching 1.3410 dollars after the US
Federal Reserve appeared to open the door to a possible interest
rate cut later this year.


The euro has since lost ground against the US currency and was
trading at 1.3261 dollars in early European trading in London.


The euro reached an all-time record high against the dollar of
1.3633 on December 28, 2004.
