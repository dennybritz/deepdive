The Seychelles will hold parliamentary elections in May,
following a five-month boycott of parliament by opposition
lawmakers, the country's electoral panel announced Monday.


Nearly a week after President James Michel dissolved the
34-member national assembly, electoral commissioner Hendricks
Gappy said the polls will be conducted on May 10, 11 and 12.


"We had 90 days within which to arrange the elections and we have
chosen a time in the middle of that period," Gappy told
representatives of the country's three political parties.


Eleven opposition lawmakers have been absent from parliament
since police dispersed an illegal meeting last October where
opposition supporters were protesting legislation banning
political parties and religious groups from owning radio
stations.


But opposition Seychelles National Party chief Wavel Ramkalawan
lamented that the ruling party would have an unfair advantage in
the new polls.


"The ruling Seychelles People's Progressive Front knew when the
elections would be held so they were prepared and they are
therefore at an advantage," Ramkalawan said.


The far-flung archipelago of some 85,000 people held presidential
elections last August that saw the ruling party maintain its
30-year grip on power, with Michel winning a five-year term.
