Opposition member of Russian parliament Vladimir Ryzhkov promised
on Monday to appeal against a court ruling liquidating his party.


The leader of the liberal-leaning Republican party that was
liquidated by a supreme court decision last Friday said the
political situation ahead of forthcoming elections was "worse
than in Belarus," Russia's neighbour, whose President Alexander
Lukashenko is accused by some Western states of being a dictator.


"Our lawyers are preparing an appeal which will be presented to
the College of the Supreme Court, but we aren't under any
illusions," Ryzhkov told journalists.


The supreme court liquidated the party on the grounds that it had
less than the 50,000 members required under Russian legislation.


Ryzhkov insisted the party had enough members for registration.


He said that in the event of the appeal being rejected the party
would turn to the European Court of Human Rights and seek a
ruling "as quickly as possible due to the elections."


Russia holds parliamentary elections in December and a
presidential election next March at which President Vladimir
Putin is due to stand down.


Critics say the Kremlin has been clamping down on political
freedoms in order to limit the potential of opposition groups.


"Russia has violated the rights of almost 60,000 citizens,"
Ryzhkov said, referring to what he said was the true number of
members of the Republican party.
