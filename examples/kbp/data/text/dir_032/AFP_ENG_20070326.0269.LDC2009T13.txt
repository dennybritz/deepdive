Israel's disgraced President Moshe Katsav, on temporary leave
over a looming rape charge, will be questioned anew by police,
the attorney general said on Monday.


"The need of a new interrogation is needed as new facts have come
to the attention of the police," Menahem Mazuz said in a
statement, without elaborating on the new information.


The 61-year-old Katsav took a leave of absence from his largely
ceremonial post in late January after Mazuz said he intended to
bring a range of charges against him, including rape, sexual
harassment, abuse of power, breach of trust and accepting bribes.


Katsav faces a hearing over the allegations on May 2 in a final
step before the attorney general decides whether to charge him.


Rape in Israel carries a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison.
Although Katsav temporarily suspended himself from duty for three
months in January, he currently retains immunity from
prosecution. His mandate expires in July.


Katsav has insisted he is innocent and rejected intense pressure
from the Israeli public and politicians of all persuasions to
resign.


He faces the prospect of becoming Israel's second consecutive
president to be forced from office by scandal, ending a
lacklustre career in disgrace and perhaps prison.


His predecessor, the late Ezer Weizman, was forced to resign in
2000 after revelations that he received around 450,000 dollars
from French millionaire Edouard Saroussi in the 1980s, when
Weizman was an MP and minister.
