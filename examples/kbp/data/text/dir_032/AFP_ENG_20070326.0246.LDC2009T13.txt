American Katie Hoff smashed her own championship record to become
the first swimmer to retain the 200m individual medley at the
world swimming titles Monday.


Hoff swam the fourth-fastest time ever in the event to lower her
record by 28-100ths of a second in a winning time of two minutes
10.13 seconds.


Only one defending champion, American Tracy Caulkins, won a medal
in the subsequent edition in 1982 after winning the 1978 final in
Berlin.


Hoff again relegated Zimbabwe's Kirsty Coventry to the silver
medal with Australian Stephanie Rice third in 2:11.42.


"I knew it would be a hard race. So I tried to break away and
bring it home," Hoff said.


Her victory was America's third gold medal in the pool but they
have the same number of medals (6) as host nation Australia after
two days' competition.


"Today was a piece of cake in comparison to yesterday. And now
it's going get easier for me day by day. I'll have a good night's
sleep and then I'll be fine for Tuesday," Hoff said.


"I didn't feel pressure. I tried not to think to much. I tried to
get close to under 2:10. I raced to win."
