Myanmar on Monday accused Nobel peace laureate and democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi of planning to "devastate" the country,
and said there was no impending date for her release.


"It will be according to the law to release her, it depends on
her," said information minister Brigadier General Kyaw Hsan.


Aung San Suu Kyi was first arrested in 1989, just months after
she helped form the National League for Democracy (NLD) party in
the wake of a vicious government crackdown on a pro-democracy
uprising one year earlier.


The Nobel peace laureate has twice been freed, only to be thrown
back into house arrest. Her latest detention began in 2003, after
a pro-government mob staged a bloody attack on her convoy while
she was touring northern Myanmar.


Kyaw Hsan accused Aung San Suu Kyi of "turning back to
confrontation" each time that the government has released her.


"We treated her in a patient way, but she intended to devastate
the country," he said, without elaborating.


"That is why the government restricted her the third time," he
said, referring to her arrest in 2003.


Kyaw Hsan, speaking at the first press conference for foreign
media in country's new administrative capital which lasted some
six hours, also accused the NLD of hampering the advent of
democracy in Myanmar.


"We tried for cooperation with the NLD in the past, as we have
the same intention to implement democracy and an open market
economy," he said.


"We will take action against whoever harms the nation and the
implementation of democracy," he added.


The NLD won elections in 1990 in a landslide victory, but the
military has never allowed the party to take office.
