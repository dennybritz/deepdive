The vast majority of Palestinians support a reinvigorated Arab
initiative for a comprehensive Middle East peace, according to an
opinion poll published on Monday.


Seventy-two percent support the Saudi-inspired plan, compared
with 26 percent who are opposed, said the poll carried out by the
Ramallah-based Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research.


The initiative calls for the Arab world to fully normalise its
relations with the Jewish state in exchange for it withdrawing
from all Arab territory occupied in the 1967 Six Day War, the
creation of a Palestinian state and granting right of return to
Palestinian refugees.


The five-year-old plan is expected to be at the centre of
discussions during an Arab summit in Riyadh beginning on
Wednesday.


Israel, which initially rejected the initiative, has recently
said it could serve as basis for negotiations provided the clause
on right of Palestinian return is dropped.


Sixty-three percent of Palestinians favour "mutual recognition of
Israel as a state for the Jewish people and Palestine as a state
for the Palestinian people," while 35 percent are against, the
poll said.


Seventy-one percent of Palestinians favour negotiations with
Israel to create a Palestinian state, the poll said.


The survey questioned 1,270 people in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip and had a three-percent margin of error.
