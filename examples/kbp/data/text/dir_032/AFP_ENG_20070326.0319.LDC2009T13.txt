Four men of north African origin were arrested Monday in an
investigation into a suspected Islamist underground network,
police said.


The men, aged between 30 and 40, were detained in dawn raids at
Trappes, in the southwestern Paris outskirts.


Police said they had links with an Islamist group that was
dismantled in September 2005. Four of that group's members --
including suspected leader Safe Bourrada -- are under
investigation on terrorist charges.
