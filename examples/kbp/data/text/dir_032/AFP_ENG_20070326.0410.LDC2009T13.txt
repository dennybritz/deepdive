Three police officers died, one was injured and the detainee they
were escorting was also hurt when a warden opened fire from a
guard tower at a prison in central Poland, officials said Monday.


"Two police officers were killed instantly. Another was seriously
injured. The prisoner was also hurt," local police spokeswoman
Magdalena Zielinska told the news channel TVN24.


The seriously injured police officer died on the operating table
as doctors tried to save his life on Monday afternoon. The
prisoner remained in a critical condition.


"After an exchange of fire, the warden was overpowered. He was
also injured," Zielinska said.


The 28-year-old warden opened fire from a tower at the entrance
of the prison in Sieradz, targeting the car carrying the police
officers and the detainee, who was been taken for a meeting with
investigators.


The warden then barricaded himself inside the tower. Police made
an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate before launching an assault.


Interior Minister Janusz Kaczmarek said that the gunman may have
had acted after a personal crisis.


"I have preliminary information suggesting that the warden was
having family problems," Kaczmarek was quoted by PAP news agency
as saying.
