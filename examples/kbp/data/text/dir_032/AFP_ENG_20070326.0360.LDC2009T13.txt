Sales of new US homes fell 3.9 percent in February, hitting the
lowest level since June 2000, the Commerce Department said
Monday.


The report showed an annualized rate of 848,000 new homes sold
last month, well below the average Wall Street estimate of
995,000 homes and suggesting the woes are not yet over for the
ailing US real estate market.
