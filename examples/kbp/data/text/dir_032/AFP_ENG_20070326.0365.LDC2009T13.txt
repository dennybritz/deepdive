Archaeologists in northwestern Greece have unearthed hundreds of
burial offerings over 8,000 years old at a cluster of Stone Age
settlements atop a mountain valley, the project's leading
archaeologist said on Monday.


"These finds cap over 20 years of research in the area,"
archaeologist Georgia Karamitrou-Mentesidi, head of the local
prehistoric and classical antiquities department told AFP.


The archaeologists found at least 30 settlements with limestone-
paved homes -- some of them subterranean -- surrounded by wooden
stake enclosures in a valley 700 metres (2,310 feet) above sea
level between the mountains of Vermio and Askio, near the town of
Ptolemaida.


They also discovered 15 graves containing around 2,000 burial
objects, among them gold amulets and a buffalo-shaped ceramic
statuette.


Other stone or ceramic items found included tools, loom weights,
needles, beads and seals.


The finds date from between 6,500 and 6,000 BCE.


The excavation is financed by the Greek Public Power Corporation,
which has one of its main installations in Ptolemaida and uses
lignite from neighbouring mines to produce electricity.
