A former German transport minister, Matthias Wissmann, is to take
over as head of the powerful auto industry lobby VDA with effect
from June 1, the body announced on Monday.


Wissmann, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, will replace Bernd
Gottschalk, who stepped down as VDA president on March 10, the
industry federation said in a statement.


While a long list of names from the auto industry had been mooted
as Gottschalk's possible successors, it appeared likely that a
political figure would be appointed as German car makers seek to
face up to increasing pressure from the European Commission to
build cars with low carbon dioxide emissions.


Wissmann, 57, was transport minister between 1993 and 1998 under
the then conservative chancellor Helmut Kohl.


Gottschalk, 63, had been VDA president since 1996, but had
reportedly come under increasing fire for failing to defend the
car makers' interests vigorously enough amid the debate over
carbon gas emissions.
