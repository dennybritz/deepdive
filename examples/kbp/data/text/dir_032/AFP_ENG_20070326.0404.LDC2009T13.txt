Ten members of an alleged Montenegrin crime gang went on trial
here Monday over the 2005 shooting death of former deputy police
chief Slavoljub Scekic.


Of the group, five face charges of direct involvement in Scekic's
murder, while the others were accused of being part of an
organised criminal group implicated in the crime, according to
the High Court.


Only one of them, Sasa Boreta, appeared before the court in the
capital Podgorica on Monday, pleading not guilty.


"I'm not able to identify myself with any part of the indictment,
which I find upsetting," said Boreta, insisting he learned of
Scekic's murder through the media.


Scekic was killed by automatic weapons fire as he left his
Podgorica home in August 2005.


According to the indictment, the gang murdered him because of an
investigation he had been leading into three bomb attacks on a
luxurious coastal hotel.


The attacks were allegedly motivated by an attempt at extortion.


Scekic had also headed the investigation into the murder of Dusko
Jovanovic, the editor of the opposition newspaper Dan who was
gunned down in a similar shooting in May 2004.
