Shares in the telecommunications equipment group Alcatel-Lucent
jumped Monday on news the company had landed a six-billion-dollar
(4.5-billion-euro) contract with US operator Verizon Wireless.


The price of Alcatel-Lucent stock gained 5.29 percent to 9.16
euros in midday Paris trades, while the CAC-40 index of leading
shares slipped by 0.19 percent overall.


The three-year deal with Verizon was a much needed boost for
Alcatel-Lucent, which has seen its stock lose 15.69 percent of
its value this year on concern that a struggling merger would
result in lost market share.


The group also faces stiff competition and announced on February
9 that it would cut 12,500 jobs worldwide.


Verizon Wireless is one of several clients that had postponed
major deals with Alcatel-Lucent while waiting to see if its
merger would work out.


The contract with Verizon covers equipment, software and network
services that should allow the mobile operator to expand the
coverage and capacity of its third-generation network.
