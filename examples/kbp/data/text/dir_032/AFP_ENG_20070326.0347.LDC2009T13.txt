Russia faces "difficult" negotiations with Georgia over Moscow's
accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a top Russian
foreign ministry official said in an interview published on
Monday.


"The last questions that have to be settled to ensure WTO entry
are the most difficult, including those concerning Georgia,"
Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Denisov said in the interview,
published on the ministry's website.


Relations between Moscow and Tbilisi have been tense in recent
months and Georgia, already a WTO member, has warned that it
could hold up Russia's long- standing bid to join the global
trade body.


Denisov said that Georgia's objections were "more political than
economic" and that trade problems between the two countries
should be resolved bilaterally and not in the context of the WTO.


Russia has banned imports of Georgian mineral water and wine,
citing food safety concerns. Georgian officials say the bans are
a political measure aimed at weakening pro-Western Georgian
President Mikheil Saakashvili.
