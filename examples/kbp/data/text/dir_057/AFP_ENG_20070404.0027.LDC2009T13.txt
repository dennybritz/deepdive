Japanese share prices closed up 1.74 percent on Wednesday,
rallying for a second straight day as gains on Wall Street and a
weaker yen cheered investors, dealers said.


They said buyers were also encouraged by a dip in crude oil
prices on signals of easing tensions between Iran and Britain
over Tehran's capture of 15 sailors and marines.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 300.04 points to 17,544.09. The TOPIX index of all issues on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section added 26.20 points or
1.54 percent to 1,730.52.
