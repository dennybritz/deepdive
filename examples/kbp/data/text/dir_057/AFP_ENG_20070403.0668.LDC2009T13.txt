Around 30 people were killed by the huge earthquake and tsunami
which devastated swathes of the western Solomon Islands, police
said Wednesday.


"At this stage the death toll is around 30," deputy police
commissioner Peter Marshall told AFP.


Aircraft surveys of the devastated areas in Western Province and
adjacent Choiseul province revealed no signs of widespread
deaths, Marshall said.


"There were very obvious areas of destruction to villages and
landslips around the various locations," he said.


"Having said that, there was no evidence of widespread death
compared to the events in Phuket at the end of 2004," Marshall
said, referring to the Asian tsunami which killed 220,000 people
around the Indian Ocean.


"There were no obvious numbers of deceased people at all," he
said.


But he warned it was too soon to assume the toll would not rise
significantly.


He said police were checking reports that up to a dozen bodies
had been seen floating off the island of Simbo, one of the worst
affected areas.
