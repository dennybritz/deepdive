Some 42 percent of South Korean legislators are undecided about
whether to approve the sweeping free trade agreement reached
Monday with the United States, a poll showed Wednesday.


About 31 percent of the National Assembly members are in favour
and some 23 percent opposed, acording to the poll of 282 of the
current 296 legislators by Hankook Ilbo and its sister newspaper
The Korea Times.


The rest gave no response.


The agreement must be ratified by the legislatures of both
countries, and President Roh Moo-Hyun acknowledged Tuesday that
this would not be easy in his country.


"The bottom line is that the government has to persuade the
people," he said.


Raising hopes of approval, the Korea Times said a majority of the
undecided support the deal in principle but want further details
of government moves to protect farmers and others.


The government has said it would compensate farmers, small
manufacturers and service businesses.


It said it would offer farmers direct payments for a loss of
earnings and compensate those who decide to leave the land. Roh
also instructed ministers to estimate losses in each industrial
sector so countermeasures can be devised.
