US Senator Hillary Clinton on Tuesday urged supporters to
petition President George W. Bush to drop his threat to veto
bills approved in the US Congress that set a date to pull back US
forces from Iraq.


Clinton, a former US first lady and senator from New York, is
seeking the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2008
presidential election.


"The American people have had enough of the president's failed
strategy in Iraq," read the message on Clinton's presidential
campaign website.


"Join Hillary in telling him to listen to the will of the people
and to Congress, withdraw his veto threat, and begin phased
deployment of the troops out of Iraq."


In a Tuesday news conference, Bush reiterated his threat to veto
any bill that had a withdrawal date for US forces in Iraq.


He warned that Congress's failure to unconditionally approve his
request for war funds in the coming weeks will only hurt US
troops.


"The price of that failure will be paid by our troops and their
loved ones," Bush said.


In a statement, Democratic Party chief Howard Dean said that Bush
"should work with Democrats in Congress to give the American
people the new direction in Iraq they demanded last November."


Democrats took control of both chambers of the US Congress in
November, a vote widely seen as a repudiation of Bush's Iraq
policy.
