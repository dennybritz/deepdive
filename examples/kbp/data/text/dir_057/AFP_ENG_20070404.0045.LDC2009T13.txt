The German-US auto giant DaimlerChrysler officially confirmed for
the first time Wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled
US unit Chrysler.


"I can confirm that we are holding talks with a number of
potential partners who have expressed a clear interest,"
DaimlerChrysler chief executive Dieter Zetsche said in a speech
prepared for delivery at the car maker's annual shareholder
meeting here.


But he insisted that DaimlerChrysler was "keeping all options
open."


Zetsche declined to elaborate further, to maintain "the largest
possible room for manoeuvre" in the talks.


Speculation has been rife that Chrysler would be put up for sale
after it turned in operating loss of 1.12 billion euros (1.5
billion dollars) last year, despite repeated restructuring
efforts in recent years.


Chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift
away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports
utility vehicles.


In mid-February, DaimlerChrysler said it would slash thousands
more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making US
subsidiary in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to turn
Chrysler around.
