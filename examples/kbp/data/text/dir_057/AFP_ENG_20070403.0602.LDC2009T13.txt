Mexico's Cuauhtemoc Blanco became the latest player to sign with
the MLS under the league's new salary cap exception policy.


The Chicago Fire on Tuesday signed Blanco, a creative striker
with Club America of the Mexican First Division.


Terms were not disclosed. Blanco is expected to join the team
July 1, almost two months after the start of the season.


Last November, MLS instituted the designated player rule, which
allow clubs to exceed the 1.9-million-dollar salary cap to sign
certain players.


The cap clearly has prevented some of the top players from Europe
being lured to the United States.


The Los Angeles Galaxy was the first team to exercise the
designated player rule when it signed David Beckham to a five-
year deal worth an estimated 250 million dollars in salary and
endorsements in January.


A fixture on the Mexican national team, Blanco has scored 25
goals in 95 games, and also represented Mexico at two World Cups
(1998, 2002), scoring in each one.
