Chinese share prices rose 0.27 percent higher in Wednesday
morning trade, extending their reach into record territory, with
banks and machinery stocks in favor, dealers said.


They said the bullish trend backed by the extending capital
inflow would continue as long as no administrative manipulation
was in the way.


"Investors have been encouraged by impressive 2006 earnings
results announced by many listed firms so far, which have shown
average profit growth of about 40 percent," said Cao Yan, an
analyst at Soochow Securities.


"The market is likely to maintain this upward momentum on
continued fund inflows, as long as the regulator does not attempt
to control it by issuing new polices (aimed at reining in
investment)," Cao added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
up 9.01 points at 3,300.31.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 9.36 points or 0.27 percent at
3,468.82 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was up 9.41 points or
1.05 percent at 902.98, a new record high.
