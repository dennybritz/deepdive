British military bomb disposal experts were attempting to
stabilise and defuse a large unexploded device, thought to be a
World War II relic, on Tuesday, in Plymouth, Devon, southwest
England.


The operation to deal with the device, which weighs between 350
and 500 pounds (159 to 227 kilograms), could take several hours,
police said, as hundreds of local people were evacuated to a
nearby school and the area was cordoned off.


According to Devon and Cornwall Police, the bomb disposal experts
intend to stabilise the device, defuse it, and take it out to sea
to detonate it.


"The item was protruding about six inches (15 centimetres) from
the ground and was described as being up to 10 inches in
diameter," a local police spokeswoman said.


It was discovered Tuesday afternoon by workmen on a construction
site, but a thorough examination of the bomb did not begin until
all those living within 100 metres of the scene were evacuated.


Plymouth was targeted by German raids during World War II because
of its strategic importance as a major naval port.
