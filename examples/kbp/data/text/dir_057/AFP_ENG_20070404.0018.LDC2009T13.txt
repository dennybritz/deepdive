A Philippine election official was gunned down in the latest in a
series of political murders that have drawn international
condemnation, police said Wednesday.


Rights groups say more than 800 activists, officials, journalists
and missionaries have been assassinated since President Gloria
Arroyo came to power in 2001, and the United Nations has pointed
a finger of blame at the military.


Pete Amurin, a local election board official in the city of
Puerto Princesa, the capital of Palawan island, was shot dead
late on Tuesday, senior police superintendent David Martinez
said.


"We have not established the motive behind the killing yet,"
Martinez said.


The killing comes just weeks ahead of mid-term elections in May
14 that are being seen in part as a referendum on Arroyo, who has
been dogged by allegations that she cheated in her 2004 re-
election win.


Elections in the Philippines are often marred by vote fraud and
violence, and Amurin is the third victim of a suspected
politically motivated murder in the past 10 days.


Witnesses said an unidentified man embraced Amurin and then shot
him at close range. The man then fled with a companion on a
waiting motorcycle.


A UN rights investigator and an independent Philippine commission
both concluded that the military has had a role in some of the
killings as part of a state- sanctioned policy to target Arroyo's
opponents.


The government and military have vigorously denied the charges.
