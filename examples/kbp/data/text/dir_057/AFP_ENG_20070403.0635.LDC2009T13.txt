Cuba and Spain signed Tuesday an agreement creating a mechanism
for political consultation, to include the sensitive human rights
issue.


Visiting Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos and his
Cuban counterpart Felipe Perez Roque signed an "Agreement for the
Establishment of Political Consultations, Including a Dialogue on
Human Rights."


"We stand before a novel mechanism," Moratinos said. "First will
be discussion of a timetable for setting and approaching issues.
Absolutely no matter will be excluded," he said in a joint press
conference alongside Perez Roque.
