Hong Kong share prices finished the morning session 0.90 percent
higher Wednesday, tracking a rally on Wall Street overnight after
better-than-expected home sales data eased concerns over the US
housing sector, dealers said.


They said the market was also boosted by expectations of
increased fund flows into equities in the second quarter while
property stocks and other blue chips led the gains.


However, ICBC was lower after announcing lower than expected 2006
net profit.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 179.11 points
at 20,181.81.
