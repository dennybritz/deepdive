Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television will debut online on Thursday
what it bills as the first gay-themed television programme
available in China and featuring an openly gay host.


"Tong Xing Xiang Lian", or "Gay Connections", will be aired in 12
one-hour instalments on the broadcaster's website and three other
sites, a statement on Phoenix's website said.


The live programme will be hosted by Didier Zheng, a French-
educated homosexual formerly involved in AIDS awareness
activities in China, it said.


The programme's first half will be devoted to discussion of gay
topics while the latter half will provide a forum for gay web-
users to make friends with other viewers, it said.


The show's producers could not immediately be reached for
comment.


The program will be broadcast Thursday on the online video pages
of Phoenixtv.com, and the Chinese portals Sina.com, QQ.com and
Mop.com.


China has a gay population estimated in the tens of millions but
homosexuality is still a largely taboo subject in the country due
to a mix of traditional conservatism and communist prejudice
against gays.


It was listed as a mental disorder until 2001.


Official disapproval has softened somewhat since then, with a top
university last year publishing the first report focused on gay
sex among men in China.


Authorities have even allowed some officially sanctioned gay
Internet chatrooms in Beijing.


However, the government remains nervous about the subject and has
blocked access to some overseas gay-oriented sites.
