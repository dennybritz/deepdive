Jake Peavy tossed six sharp innings and Josh Bard had a career-
high four hits as the San Diego Padres coasted to a 7-0 win over
the San Francisco Giants in the MLB season opener for both teams.


Giants slugger Barry Bonds had a quiet season debut on Tuesday,
collecting an opposite-field single, a stolen base and a walk.


The seven-time NL MVP, who is just 21 home runs away from tying
Hank Aaron's all-time mark, received a raucous ovation when he
was introduced prior to the contest.


An All-Star in 2005, Peavy struggled through a rough 2006
campaign, going 11-14 with a 4.09 ERA.


But the hard-throwing righthander was brilliant Tuesday, yielding
just three hits and two walks while striking out six.


Peavy's performance upstaged a landmark day for the Giants, who
introduced a new manager, unveiled a new ace and honored their
former All-Stars.


It was a forgettable debut for San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy,
who joined the club last October after guiding the Padres to four
National League West Division titles and a World Series
appearance over the last 12 years.
