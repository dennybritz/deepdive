There have been "further contacts" between Britain and Iran over
15 detained sailors on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's office said, adding that "both sides share a desire for
an early resolution of this issue."


"There have been further contacts between the United Kingdom and
Iran this evening, including directly with Dr Ali Larijani,"
Blair's Downing Street office said in a statement.


According to the statement, Blair "remains committed to resolving
this by diplomatic means," and Britain has proposed direct
bilateral discussions and is waiting for an Iranian response.
