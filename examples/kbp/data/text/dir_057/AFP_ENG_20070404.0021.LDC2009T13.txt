An Israeli soldier was seriously wounded overnight in exchanges
of fire with Palestinian militants in the north of the occupied
West Bank, the army and militants said Wednesday.


"A soldier was wounded last night when Palestinians opened fire
against an army patrol operating in the refugee camp in Jenin,"
an army spokeswoman said.


The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a group loosely affiliated with
president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, said in a phone call to AFP
that its fighters had shot at the soldiers during a raid in the
refugee camp.


On Tuesday, a top leader of the Brigades was seriously wounded in
exchanges of fire with Israeli soldiers in Nablus, also in the
nothern West Bank.
