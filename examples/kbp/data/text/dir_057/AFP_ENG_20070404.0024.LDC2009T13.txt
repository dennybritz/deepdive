Fresh from sealing a free trade pact with the United States,
South Korea wants to reach a similar agreement with India by the
end of the year, the foreign ministry said Wednesday.


It said Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon and Indian Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh agreed to push for a comprehensive economic
partnership agreement (CEPA) at a meeting in New Delhi on
Tuesday.


Song also met Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee on the sidelines
of a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation, which Seoul was attending as an observer.


"At the meetings, Minister Song (and the Indian officials) shared
an understanding to work for conclusion of CEPA negotiations
within the year," a ministry statement said.


Five rounds of CEPA negotiations have been held since March 2006.
A fresh four- day round began in Seoul on Tuesday.


CEPA seeks to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation
by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers.


Song and his Indian counterparts also agreed to arrange a visit
by the Indian prime minister "at a time convenient to both
sides," the statement said.


The Indian side also expressed its support for a peaceful
settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue, it added.


The US-South Korea free trade agreement was reached Monday after
10 months of tough negotiations. South Korea has also signed FTAs
with Chile, Singapore, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
and the European Free Trade Association linking Iceland, Norway,
Switzerland, and Liechtenstein.


Seoul will start negotiations on an FTA with the European Union
by June.
