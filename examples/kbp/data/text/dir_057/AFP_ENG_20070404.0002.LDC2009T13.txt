Myanmar has offered to be a long-term supplier of sand, granite
and other constuction material to Singapore, the city-state's
foreign ministry said.


Myanmar's ruling junta conveyed the offer to Singapore Foreign
Minister George Yeo, who is visiting the country, the ministry
said in a statement issued late Tuesday.


Singapore, which lacks natural resources of its own, has been
looking for other sources of construction material after
neighbouring Indonesia banned the export of sand, a key
ingredient for concrete.


Stricter checks by the Indonesian authorities on potential sand
smugglers have also affected granite exports to Singapore. Both
materials are in high demand in the robust building and
construction sector.


Indonesia has said the ban was intended to protect the
environment although critics said it was aimed at pressuring its
island-republic neighbour into signing an extradition treaty.


A number of suspects wanted in Indonesia on corruption charges
have fled to Singapore to escape the reach of Indonesian justice,
officials in Jakarta allege.


Singapore's Building and Construction Authority has said that
while the cost of sand imported from other countries is expected
to increase, largely due to transport expenses, the situation is
"manageable."
