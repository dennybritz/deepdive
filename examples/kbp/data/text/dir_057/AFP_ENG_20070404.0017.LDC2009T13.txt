Two men in Indonesia stormed a military headquarters
unchallenged, stealing more than 50,000 dollars and a handgun
before fleeing the scene, a report said Wednesday.


The machete-wielding robbers, wearing army fatigues, entered the
local military base on Sulawesi island Monday and made straight
for the finance office, the Koran Tempo newspaper said.


They attacked soldiers during the raid, wounding a soldier before
making off with the handgun and envelopes containing soldiers'
wages worth 50,273 dollars, the report said.


The robbers then used the stolen weapon to shoot another soldier
in the knee as they left the headquarters, the report added.
