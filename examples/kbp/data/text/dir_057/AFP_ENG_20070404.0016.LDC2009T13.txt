Sri Lankan troops have shot dead six Tamil Tiger rebels in
clashes in the island's embattled northern and eastern regions,
the defence ministry said Wednesday.


Four members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were
shot dead in two separate incidents in the Jaffna peninsula on
Tuesday, the ministry said.


It said two more Tiger gunmen were shot dead in the eastern
district of Ampara, the scene of a bus bombing on Monday that
left 16 people dead.


There were no reports of casualties among troops, and there was
no immediate reaction from the guerrillas to the military claims.


The Tigers did say that the Sri Lankan air force carried out
aerial attacks inside rebel-held territory Tuesday, wounding four
civilians.


The Tamil rebels have waged a 35-year campaign for independence
that has claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
