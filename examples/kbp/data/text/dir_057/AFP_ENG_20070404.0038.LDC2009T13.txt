Cuban President Fidel Castro blasted US President George W.
Bush's promotion of ethanol Wednesday in his second newspaper
article in a week, saying it could lead to a war over energy and
a "total holocaust."


Writing in Granma, Castro continued on the theme of his March 29
piece in which he said Bush's policy to promote ethanol fuels
from farm crops was condemning "more than three billion people"
to premature starvation.
