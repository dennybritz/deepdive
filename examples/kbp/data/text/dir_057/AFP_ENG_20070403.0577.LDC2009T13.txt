The United States has released 250,000 dollars in aid to the
tsunami-struck Solomon Islands for shelter, health and water
needs, the State Department said Tuesday.


"The United States offers its condolences to the people and
government of the Solomon Islands on the tragic loss of life and
the homelessness caused by the April 2 earthquake and resulting
tsunami," spokesman Sean McCormack said.


The US ambassador spoke with Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and
Foreign Minister Patteson Oti to express Washington's sympathy
and offer US assistance, McCormack said in a statement.


"The United States has released 250,000 dollars in disaster
assistance funds to support immediate relief needs in the Solomon
Islands," he said.


"These funds will support humanitarian assistance organizations
addressing shelter, health, water, and sanitation needs in the
affected area."


A powerful earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami that has
left 24 people dead and 5,400 homeless in the South Pacific
nation.
