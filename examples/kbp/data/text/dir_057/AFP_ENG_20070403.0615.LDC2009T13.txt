Olindo Mare will not make it to an 11th season with the Miami
Dolphins.


Mare, the franchise leader in field goals and points, was traded
on Tuesday to the New Orleans Saints for a sixth-round pick in
this month's National Football League draft.


Mare's days in Miami were numbered when the Dolphins signed
kicker Jay Feely to a three-year contract last month.


Voted to the Pro Bowl in 1999, Mare has 12 game-winning kicks in
his career and booted 15 field goals of 50 yards or more.
