Australian share prices jumped to record highs in midday trade
Wednesday on the back of the central bank's decision to leave
interest rates on hold and amid increased takeover activity,
dealers said.


At 12:30 pm (0230 GMT), the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was up 65.0
points or 1.08 percent at 6,078.7. The index had earlier reached
a fresh intra-day high of 6,091.1, well above the previous all-
time high of 6,052.1.


The previous closing record was 6,044.0, set on February 26, one
day before a sharp sell-off in Chinese stocks roiled global
equity markets.


The broader All Ordinaries Index was up 63.2 points or 1.05
percent at  6,060.9, also well over the previous intra-day high
of 6,024.7.


Dealers said the market was buoyed by a decision by the Reserve
Bank of Australia to keep official interest rates on hold at 6.25
percent even though many had expected a hike given a strong
economy and price pressures.


Retailer Coles Group, the object of a 19.7 billion dollar
takeover bid by conglomerate Wesfarmers, led the gains, they
said.


Coles rose 0.85 dollars to 16.96 dollars while Wesfarmers added
1.48 to 38.40.


Index leader BHP Billiton was up 0.52 or 1.73 percent at 30.61
while fellow miner Rio Tinto gained 1.75 or 2.22 percent to
80.65.


National Australia Bank climbed 0.35 to 50.81 and Commonwealth
Bank was up 0.48 to 50.81.
