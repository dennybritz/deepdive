The banned political wing of the armed Basque separatist group
ETA said Tuesday it plans to register supporters as independent
candidates in upcoming local elections to get around a
prohibition against taking part in the poll.


Batasuna spokesman Pernando Barrena said the electoral lists for
the May 27 elections in the northern Basque and Navarre regions
would be made up of people with no official political affiliation
but who are close to the party.


The announcement was made shortly after Spanish prosecutors asked
the Supreme Court to prohibit a new Basque party called Abertzale
Sozialisten Batasuna, which was seeking to take part in the
elections.


Barrena said the bid to ban the new party from taking part in the
regional polls was "inconceivable".


Batasuna was banned under a 2003 law which required all political
parties to denounce violence. It has refused to break definitely
with ETA, whose armed 38-year campaign for Basque independence
has claimed over 800 lives.


Spain's Socialist government has said Batasuna could only take
part in the elections if it gave an unequivocal statement
disowning the armed struggle.


Batasuna captured around 10 percent of the vote in the last
municipal elections held in the Basque region in 2001.


Both the European Union and the US State Department consider
Batasuna a terrorist organisation along with ETA.
