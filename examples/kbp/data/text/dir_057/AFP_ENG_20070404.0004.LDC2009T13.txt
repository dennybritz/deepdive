A military helicopter crash in southern Taiwan claimed the lives
of all eight army officers on board, the defence ministry said
Wednesday.


The UH-1H chopper crashed into a radio tower Tuesday in a
mountain area in Kaohsiung county during a training drill.


Five bodies were initially found on a nearby slope and inside the
broken craft as hundreds of rescuers searched for survivors.


Remains of the three missing military personnel were recovered
Wednesday, officials said.


The ministry said it is investigating the cause of the accident
after an initial probe showed that the chopper might have hit the
tower in bad weather.
