Canada plans to rent around 20 German tanks to better protect its
soldiers in Afghanistan, local media reported Tuesday.


The Canadian government will rent 20 Leopard type A6M tanks from
the German army because they offer better protection against
anti-tank explosive devices than those currently possessed by the
Canadian army, CTV television said.


In addition, the army's 30-year-old C2 tanks cannot be used in
Afghanistan because with the summer heat the inside temperature
would surpass 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit). The
German A6M models are air-conditioned.


Prime Minister Stephen Harper declined to offer specifics when
asked about the deal.


"The Cabinet has been discussing the tank issue and we'll have an
announcement on that shortly," he said.


Canada has deployed a contingent of 2,500 soldiers in southern
Afghanistan where they are part of coalition forces hunting down
militants from the ousted Taliban regime and their Islamist
allies including Al-Qaeda members.


Since 2002, 45 Canadian soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan.
