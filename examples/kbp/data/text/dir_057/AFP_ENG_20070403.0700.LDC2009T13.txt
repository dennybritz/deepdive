The world champion St. Louis Cardinals' already shaky rotation
absorbed another hit when the club announced Chris Carpenter will
miss his next start with right elbow inflammation.


Carpenter was set to start Friday against Houston but will skip
the game as a precautionary measure. He will be examined further
over the next few days.


The Cardinals lost starters Jeff Suppan, Jeff Weaver and Jason
Marquis as free agents in the offseason and replaced them in the
rotation with relievers Adam Wainwright and Braden Looper and
free agent Kip Wells, who was injured most of last season.
Anthony Reyes is the other member of the rotation.


In Sunday's game against the New York Mets, Carpenter allowed
five runs in six innings of a 6-1 loss.


The 2005 Cy Young Award winner, Carpenter was 15-8 with a 3.09
ERA in 32 starts last season.
