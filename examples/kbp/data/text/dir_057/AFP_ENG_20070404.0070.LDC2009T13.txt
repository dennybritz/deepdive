Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has embarked on a private
visit to the Far East amid a 48-hour general strike called by the
largest labour organisation, state media reported on Wednesday.


Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, told The Herald newspaper
that the president had left on the eve of the strike which began
on Tuesday and was due back home at the weekend.


The spokesman did not specify Mugabe's destination, but the 83
-year-old has been a frequent visitor to Malaysia and has also
assiduously forged ties with Asian countries such as India and
China after being boycotted by the West.
