Tennis legend Pete Sampras will return to the tennis court next
month when he plays in the Outback Champions Series, a circuit of
former stars.


Sampras, who won a record 14 Grand Slam titles, has not taken to
the court competitively since winning the 2002 U.S. Open in his
farewell to competitive tennis. He was inducted to the
International Tennis Hall of Fame in January.


Sampras will make his return in Champions Cup Boston, the second
tournament of the series at Agganis Arena from May 2-6. He will
join stars such as John McEnroe and Jim Courier.


In his first match on May 3, Sampras will face former Australian
Open champion Petr Korda. Two nights later, he will take on
McEnroe, a seven-time Grand Slam champion.
