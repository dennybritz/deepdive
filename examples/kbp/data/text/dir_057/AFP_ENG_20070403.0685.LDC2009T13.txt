Ailing Argentine football hero Diego Maradona was improving
favorably from hepatitis brought on by alcohol abuse, nearly a
week after being hospitalized, the hospital director said
Tuesday.


"Diego Maradona is in the sixth day of care, maintaining good
progress regarding the toxic alcohol hepatitis," Guemes Hospital
director Hector Pezzello told reporters. "There has been no
deterioration."


Maradona's personal doctor, Alfredo Cahe, said Monday that the
former Boca Juniors, Barcelona and Napoli star would have to stay
two weeks in bed.


Maradona, 46, has been called one of the greatest players of the
last century but his career on and off the pitch has been marred
by repeated drug and alcohol abuse. He retired from professional
football in 1997.


He has suffered from chronic hepatitis since he contracted
hepatitis B in 1991, while he played for Barcelona.


Maradona, who suffered a heart attack in 2004 following a cocaine
overdose, was rushed to the hospital from his parents' house last
week with unknown symptoms.


Days before that, Cahe had said Maradona might leave for
Switzerland for treatment after his weight had again ballooned.
