Nasdaq is hoping to attract more Chinese companies, state media
in China reported Wednesday, as the US stock market operator said
it planned a new index for companies from the Asian giant.


Robert Greifeld, the chief executive officer of Nasdaq, met
company representatives in Beijing on Tuesday to celebrate the
total of 40 Chinese companies now listed on the Nasdaq exchange,
the Xinhua news agency reported.


"In organizing this little ceremony, Nasdaq is clearly hunting
for more Chinese companies," Zhang Zhimin, a senior analyst with
Securities Research, told Xinhua.


Following an earlier visit by Greifeld in 2005, a total of 15
Chinese companies have listed on the Nasdaq, Xinhua said.


"China is our fastest-growing market outside the United States.
We are optimistic about the number of Chinese companies that can
list on Nasdaq," said Xu Guangxun, chief representative of Nasdaq
in China.


Meanwhile, Nasdaq said in a statement it planned to introduce in
the second quarter the Nasdaq China Index, tracking the
performance of the largest Chinese companies whose securities are
listed and actively traded in the United States.


The index will initially be comprised of 30 Chinese companies
that are listed on NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or the
American Stock Exchange, it said.
