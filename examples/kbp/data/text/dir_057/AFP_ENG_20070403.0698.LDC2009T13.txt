An earthquake packing a magnitude of 6.0 hit off the Solomons
Islands on Wednesday, two days after an 8.0 quake rocked the area
and spawned a tsunami that has killed at least 30 people.


The latest quake was shallow and hit 139 kilometers (86 miles)
northwest of Gizo, which was shattered by Monday's killer
tsunami, at 11:39am (0039 GMT), according to the US Geological
Survey.


The quake was just 10 kilometers (six miles) below the seabed,
but no tsunami warning was generated.


The region has been rocked by continuing aftershocks mesuaring up
to 6.7 in strength since the big quake and tsunami hit two days
ago.
