The overnight curfew in Baghdad will be reduced by three hours,
beginning on Wednesday, a senior Iraqi military officer said.


"The chief of the armed forces (Prime Minister) Nuri al-Maliki
has ordered that the curfew now be imposed between 10 pm and 5 am
(1800 GMT and 0100 GMT) from tomorrow," General Qassem Ata al-
Moussawi said on Tuesday.


Since February, as part of a massive US-Iraqi effort to quell
sectarian violence in the capital, a curfew has been imposed from
8 pm to 6 am.
