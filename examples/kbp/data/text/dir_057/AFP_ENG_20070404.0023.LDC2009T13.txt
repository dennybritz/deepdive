China will not follow the energy consumption model that the
United States has pursued due to its limited resources, state
media reported Wednesday, citing a senior official.


China would need 4.5 billion tonnes of oil annually if it
consumed energy like the United States, said Xu Dingming, vice
director of the Office of the National Energy Leading Group,
according to the Xinhua news agency.


This is unlikely to happen because the annual global oil supply
is just four billion tonnes with only 1.6 billion tonnes in
commercial circulation, Xu said at an energy forum in Shanghai on
Tuesday.


He warned given the annual oil consumption of two tonnes per
vehicle, China's transportation sector could become a large
energy consumer in the future.


The number of cars in the country is growing by 20 percent a
year, he said. According to official statistics, Chinese citizens
owned nearly 30 million private cars at the end of 2006.


Xu said instead of following the western model, which saw 15
percent of the world's population using the lion's share of the
world's energy, China would have to figure out a cleaner and more
efficient consumption model of its own.
