A Pakistani was beheaded in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for the
stabbing murder of a Saudi, the interior ministry announced.


Khaled bin Mahmud bin Abdel Ghafur had been condemned for the
killing of Wasfi bin Said al-Marhun during an argument, the
ministry said in a statement carried by the official SPA news
agency.


The beheadings bring to 26 the number of executions announced by
the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia,
or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
