Bolivian President Evo Morales will nationalize the ENTEL
telecommunications company which is half-owned by the Italian
company Euro Telecom International, a presidential spokesman
said.


A commission has been formed to study the takeover of 51 percent
or more of ENTEL by the Bolivian state, spokesman Juan Ramon
Quintana said late Monday.


Euro Telecom has owned 50 percent of ENTEL since 1995 when it
began funding a 600 million-dollar investment in the company.


The commission has one month to negotiate with Euro Telecom.


The rest of the company is owned by two Bolivian pension funds
(47.4 percent) and by employees (2.6 percent).


Since taking power a year ago as Bolivia's first indigenous
president, Morales, 47, has renegotiated gas and oil contracts
and passed controversial land reforms. He also seeks to rewrite
the constitution.


He has vowed to nationalize any formerly public company sold in
the 1990s that he finds guilty of mismanagement or violating its
privatization contract.


Between 1993 and 1997 then-president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada
took Bolivia down the free-market path privatizing most of the
country's public holdings, including oil, gas, telecommunications
and railroads.
