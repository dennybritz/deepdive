US brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos will build a greenfield brewery in
China, aiming to double sales of its Budweiser beer there over
the next five years, state media reported Wednesday.


The largest US brewer plans to make Budweiser available to an
additional 150 million potential beer drinkers by bringing it to
100 new cities with a population of at least one million people
each, the Xinhua news agency said.


The company will also introduce the domestic beer Harbin to 33
new markets in 2007, it added.


The brewery, located in south China's Guangdong province, is
scheduled for completion in late 2008 at a cost of 63 million
dollars, the report said.


It will have a production capacity of 2.6 million hectoliters
with a potential for expansion, according to a statement released
by Anheuser-Busch.


In 2006, China's beer market grew nearly 15 percent, the third
consecutive year of double-digit volume growth, according to
Anheuser-Busch.


As the largest-volume and fastest-growing beer market in the
world, China remains one of our most important international
priorities, Anheuser-Busch Chief Executive August Busch IV said
in the statement.


Anheuser-Busch owns Chinese brewers Harbin Brewery Group and
Wuhan Brewing Co as well as a stake in China's largest beer maker
Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd.


The St Louis-based company has so far invested more than 1.8
billion dollar in China, Xinhua's report said.
