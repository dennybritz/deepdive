Australian share prices rallied strongly Wednesday on merger
activity to close up 1.39 percent at record levels, fully
recovering from the Chinese-led sell-off of late February,
dealers said.


The benchmark SP/ASX 200 closed up 83.8 points 6,097.2 while the
broader All Ordinaries index rose 81.4 points to an all-time high
of 6,079.0.
