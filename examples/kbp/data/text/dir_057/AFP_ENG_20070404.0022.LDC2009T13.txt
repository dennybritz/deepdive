A man who allegedly raped a five-year-old girl was lynched in an
Indian town already reeling from a case in which dozens of poor
children were sexually assaulted and murdered, reports said
Wednesday.


Some 1,000 residents in the upscale satellite town Noida outside
New Delhi set upon the ice-cream vendor after he was found with a
girl who went missing Tuesday, the Indian Express newspaper said.


An angry mob led by the girl's father beat the vendor for over 15
minutes before police rescued him, a Hindustan Times report said.
He later died in hospital.


Tempers among residents of Nithari, a slum area where many poor
migrants of the suburb live, have been running high since bags of
human remains and clothing were found in a drain in December.


The gruesome findings were analysed and tallied with reports of
disappearances of numbers of local children over the past two
years.


Police say at least 19 people were killed, most of them children.


Indian police have charged a domestic worker, Surinder Koli, with
the rape and murder of the victims.


The man was working in the home of an affluent businessman who
was initially also suspected in the case, with the house located
close to the area where many of the missing children lived.


Two weeks ago the Central Bureau of Investigation alleged that
Koli singlehandedly kidnapped his victims and laid charges of
rape and murder against him.


Officials also alleged that in some cases he ate human flesh and
had sex with dead bodies.
