South Africa were 95-3 after 20 overs of their rain-affected
World Cup Super Eights match against Ireland at Guyana National
Stadium here on Tuesday chasing 160 to win.


Jacques Kallis was on 40 with Ashwell Prince on four.


AB de Villiers was dismissed off the third ball of the first over
when he was caught by William Porterfield at backward point off
Boyd Rankin for nought, his third duck in the tournament.


Captain Graeme Smith was next to go for 41 with the score on 71
in the 13th over falling to a brilliant catch off his own bowling
by Ireland skipper Trent Johnston.


Herschelle Gibbs was then caught by Andrew White off Rankin for
six with the score on 85.


Earlier, White top-scored with 30 in Ireland's total of 152 off
35 overs after two lengthy rain delays.


Under the Duckworth-Lewis method, South Africa's requirement was
adjusted to 160 to win.
