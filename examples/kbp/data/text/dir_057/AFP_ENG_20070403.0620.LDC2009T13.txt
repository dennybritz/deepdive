A former pizza delivery man believed to be one of the worst
serial killers in Los Angeles history went on trial here Tuesday
accused of murdering 10 women and one of his victims' unborn
babies.


Chester Turner, 40, appeared at Los Angeles Superior Court as
prosecutors told jurors how he had allegedly murdered each of his
victims during an 11-year reign of terror.


Prosecutor Bobby Grace said in his opening statement Turner was
"perhaps the most prolific killer in the city of Los Angeles."


Turner, who has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder, was
caught after being arrested for rape in Los Angeles' homeless
district in 2002.


DNA from that case linked Turner to the murders, which were
carried out between 1987 and 1998.


"Case after case after case comes back to Chester Turner," the
prosecutor said, referring to the DNA evidence.


The prosecutor showed jurors photos of the victims alive and
dead, noting that all of them had been strangled.


"These are the victims of a killer," Grace said. "Time has
passed, and we've waited for the name of that killer to emerge.
Today, we can say the name of that killer -- Chester Turner."


Prosecutors said two of Turner's victims -- 27-year-old Regina
Washington and 29 -year-old Andrea Tripplett -- were heavily
pregnant when murdered.


Turner has been charged with murdering Washington's six-
and-a-half month old fetus in 1989 but has not been charged with
killing Tripplett's unborn child during a 1993 attack.


Turner faces the death penalty if convicted.


He will also become one of Los Angeles' most notorious killers,
joining the so- called "Freeway Killer" William Bonin, who was
convicted of 14 murders and "Night Stalker" Richard Ramirez, 13.
