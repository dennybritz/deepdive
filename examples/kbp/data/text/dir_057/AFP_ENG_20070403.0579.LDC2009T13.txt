US filmmaker Joel Silver, who produced all of "The Matrix" films,
said Tuesday he is planning a remake of the 1976 Oscar-winning
science fiction classic "Logan's Run".


"I love the original material but I think that version is a bit
silly," he told reporters in Barcelona where he was promoting his
latest film "The Reaping" starring Academy Award-winner Hilary
Swank.


Based on a 1967 novel by the same name, "Logan's Run" chronicles
a future society which imposes a mandatory death sentence for all
those turning 30 in order to avoid overpopulation and the
depletion of natural resources.


The film won an Academy Award for its visual effects and was
nominated for two other Oscars.


"The Matrix" trilogy featured pioneering visuals such as
characters dodging bullets in slow-motion and levitation fighting
which were imitated by other films.


The first film in the series won four Academy Awards for
technical achievement.
