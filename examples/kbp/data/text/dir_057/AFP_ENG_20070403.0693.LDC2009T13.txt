Hong Kong share prices opened sharply higher Wednesday, gaining
0.92 percent on a rally on Wall Street after better-than-expected
home sales data eased concerns over the US housing sector,
dealers said.


The market also got a boost from expectations of increased fund
flows into equities in the second quarter.


HSBC and China Mobile led the early gains while ICBC was lower
after announcing lower than expected 2006 results.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index opened up 184.97 points at
20,187.67.


HSBC was up 0.60 dollars at 137.50 dollars and China Mobile
gained 0.95 at 71.85 while ICBC was down 0.06 at 4.34.
