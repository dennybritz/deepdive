Bayern Munich's joy at securing a 2-2 draw away here on Tuesday
in their Champions League quarter-final first leg clash with AC
Milan was tempered by Willy Sagnol picking up a season ending
injury.


The 30-year-old French international fullback suffered a right
knee injury and had to go off in the 68th minute of the match.


"According to the doctor, its a problem with the meniscus," the
53-times capped Sagnol told Canal Plus.


"An operation is likely, which would mean missing 6-8 weeks."


Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld was more categoric about it telling
the post match press conference that Sagnol, who has been with
the German side since the 2000/01 season which culminated with
them winning the Champions League, would not play for Bayern
again this season.
