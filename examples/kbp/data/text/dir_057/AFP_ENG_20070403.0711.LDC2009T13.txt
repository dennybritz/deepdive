Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday warned his Japanese
counterpart not to go to a controversial war shrine ahead of a
visit to Tokyo meant to cement warming ties.


"Individual Japanese leaders have visited numerous times and hurt
the feelings of the Chinese people," Wen said in an interview
with Japanese reporters in Beijing.


"I hope this will never happen again," he said, as quoted by
Kyodo News.


Wen will visit Japan from April 11-13, the first trip here by a
Chinese premier since 2000, as the two nations explore ways to
thaw relations haunted by Japanese aggression in China during
World War II.


Yasukuni shrine has been at the core of the tension between the
two nations. It enshrines 2.5 million Japanese war dead including
World War II leaders condemned by US-led allied powers as war
criminals.


China and Japan have been working to improve relations strained
in recent years over differences in interpreting wartime history
and continuing energy disputes, among other issues.


Japan's conservative Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, formerly a vocal
advocate of politicians visiting the shrine, has maintained a
strategic silence on whether he will go as premier.


Abe visited China in October just after taking office in a bid to
repair relations damaged by his predecessor Junichiro Koizumi's
repeated visits to the shrine.


China, calling the site a symbol of wartime atrocities, refused
all summits with Koizumi.
