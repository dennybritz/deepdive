A Toronto elementary school principal was allowed to walk free
after admitting in court to throwing human excrement on a boy
last July, media reported Tuesday.


Maria Pantalone, 49, and the sister of Toronto's deputy mayor,
pleaded guilty to assault, and conceded that she was not
justified in throwing feces at a 12-year- old boy, hitting him on
the shoulder.


"I couldn't take it anymore. It was total, total frustration,"
she testified, according to the Toronto Star.


Calling the incident a "momentary lapse of judgment," she told
the court it would not happen again.


In his ruling, the judge granted Pantalone an absolute discharge,
meaning she faces no jail or fine, and said she was "publicly
embarrassed, if not humiliated."


The circumstances surrounding the unusual assault cannot be
described due to a court publication ban to prevent
identification of the victim, who was not a student of Pantalone.


The Toronto school board must now decide whether to reinstate
her, after suspending her with pay from the position in August
2006 pending a review of the incident.
