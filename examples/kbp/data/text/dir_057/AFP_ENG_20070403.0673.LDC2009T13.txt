A strong 5.9-magnitude earthquake hit off Indonesia's Sumatra
island Wednesday, geologists said, but there were no reports of
casualties or damage.


The quake struck at 3:23 am (2023 GMT Tuesday) around 100
kilometres (60 miles) southeast of Bengkulu, the capital of the
province of the same name, said Aprilyanto from the Meteorology
and Geophysics Agency here.


Aprilyanto said that the quake struck at a depth of 57 kilometers
(35 miles).


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire"
where continental plates meet, an area of frequent seismic and
volcanic activity.
