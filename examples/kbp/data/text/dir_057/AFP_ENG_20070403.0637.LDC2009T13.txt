Oscar-winner Halle Berry became the latest celebrity to be
immortalized on Hollywood's "Walk of Fame" Tuesday, and admitted
she had struggled to hold back tears during the ceremony.


Berry, who famously sobbed on stage after winning her best
actress Oscar in 2002 for "Monster's Ball," told a crowd of well-
wishers on Hollywood Boulevard she had succumbed to another bout
of the waterworks.


"I want to officially state that I am an emotional retard," the
40-year-old said. "I am so emotional ... as soon as I saw the
crowds of people and friends here, I started to cry."


Berry's star is the 2,333rd to be laid on the "Walk of Fame" and
comes ahead of the release of her latest film, crime drama
"Perfect Stranger" alongside Bruce Willis.


The actress was initially due to receive her star in 2003 but
conflicting schedules prevented her from receiving it until now,
officials said.


Berry moved into acting after finishing as runner-up in the 1986
Miss USA pageant.


Since making her feature film debut in Spike Lee's acclaimed
"Jungle Fever" in 1991, Berry has appeared in a series of hits
including "X-Men" and the James Bond film "Die Another Day."
