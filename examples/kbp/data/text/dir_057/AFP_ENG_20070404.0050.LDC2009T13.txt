Cuban President Fidel Castro Wednesday charged US energy policies
could lead to a "total holocaust", in his second newspaper
article in a week, suggesting the long-convalescing leader is
returning to his former more lively self.


Writing in Granma newspaper, Castro continued on the theme of a
March 29 piece in which he said US President George W. Bush's
policy to promote ethanol fuels from farm crops was condemning
"more than three billion people" to premature starvation.


"The worst could be yet to come: a new war to ensure gas and oil
supplies, which could place the entire human race into a total
holocaust," said Castro in the latest article.


The article, entitled "The Globalization of Genocide," assailed
the US president for promoting global production of crop-based
alternative fuels, as Bush did during a trip last month to
Brazil.


It was the newest sign that the iconic 80-year-old Cuban leader
could be on the road to recovery after eight months mostly silent
and out of public sight.


Castro temporarily handed over power last July to his brother
Raul while recovering from a gastrointestinal operation.
