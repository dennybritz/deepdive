The United States believes that the next major terrorist attack
on its soil could be from European Muslims who feel they are
treated as "second-class citizens," Homeland Security chief
Michael Chertoff said in an interview published Wednesday.


Speaking to The Daily Telegraph before his planned arrival in
Britain on Thursday, Chertoff noted that disgruntled European
immigrant Muslims could easily enter the United States without
needing a visa beforehand -- European countries are among 27
states whose citizens do not require a visa to visit.


"Our Muslim population is better educated and economically better
off than the average American," Chertoff told the paper.


"So, from a standpoint of mobility in society, it's a successful
immigrant population ... In some countries (in Europe), you had
an influx of people that came in as a colonial legacy and may
always have felt, to some extent, that they were viewed as
second-class citizens."


Chertoff also told the paper that one of his biggest fears was
"unknown terrorists" who could use the visa waiver programme to
enter the United States.


"The fear has always been the so-called 'clean skin' -- that's a
person whose documents are completely legitimate, are not
forged."


He will meet with Home Secretary John Reid when he arrives in
Britain.
