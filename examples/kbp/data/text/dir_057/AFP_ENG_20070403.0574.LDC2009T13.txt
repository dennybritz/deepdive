South Africa were 64-1 after 10 overs of their rain-affected
World Cup Super Eights match against Ireland at Guyana National
Stadium here on Tuesday chasing 160 to win.


Captain Graeme Smith was on 35 with Jacques Kallis on 25.


AB de Villiers was dismissed off the third ball of the first over
when he was caught by William Porterfield at backward point off
Boyd Rankin for nought.


Earlier, Andrew White top-scored with 30 in Ireland's total of
152 off 35 overs after two lengthy rain delays.


Under the Duckworth-Lewis method, South Africa's requirement was
adjusted to 160 to win.
