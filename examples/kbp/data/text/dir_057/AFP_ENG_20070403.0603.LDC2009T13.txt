The son of the murdered Lebanese leader Rafiq Hariri handed in a
petition on Tuesday requesting that the United Nations establish
an international tribunal on the assassination of his father.


Saad Haririr delivered the petition which was signed by 70
Lebanese members of parliament to the UN representative in
Lebanon, Gier Pederson.


Addressed to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, it requested
that "all alternative measures" be taken by the UN Security
Council to establish an international tribunal.


Hariri wants the UN to by-pass the political paralysis in Lebanon
over establishing the tribunal which would investigate the 2005
murder of the former prime minister.


Lebanon's pro-Syrian opposition objects to the way the government
has handled plans to create the court under UN auspices and has
so far managed to block all moves to set up the court.


The United Nations has signed a deal with the government to set
up the tribunal, but it must be ratified by the country's divided
parliament.


Pro-Syrian parliament speaker Nabih Berri has refused to allow
the government to submit a bill that would authorize the court,
effectively blocking the tribunal's creation.
