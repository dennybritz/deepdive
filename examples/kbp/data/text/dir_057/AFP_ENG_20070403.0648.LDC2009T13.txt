A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 6.3 rocked the Loyalty
Islands region of the South Pacific on Wednesday, two days after
an 8.0 quake spawned a tsunami in the Solomon Islands, experts
said.


No damage was immediately reported from the quake that hit at
7:26 am (2026 GMT Tuesday), 136 kilometers (84 miles) southwest
of Isangel in Vanuatu and 137 kilometers northeast of New
Caledonia's Loyalty Islands.


No tsunami warning was issued for the earthquake.


The Pacific region has been on tenterhooks since a huge undersea
quake on Monday triggered a devastating tsunami that has killed
at least 24 people near its epicentre in the Solomons.


That quake has been followed by scores of aftershocks measuring
up to 6.7 in magnitude that have kept terrified Solomon Islanders
from returning to their homes.
