Iran's parliament speaker on Wednesday welcomed what he described
as a "change of tone" from Britain in the row over the 15 sailors
seized by Tehran, state media reported.


"London's action in changing its propaganda tone regarding the
issue of the arrest of the British sailors in our territorial
waters is appropriate," Gholam Ali Hadad Adel said before leaving
Iran on a visit to Pakistan.


"The effective measures taken by the British in the past few days
make the tone of their rhetoric more logical and instead of
controversy they are inclined towards negotiations," he added,
according to the state-run central news agency.


"This is a more appropriate action," he said.


Hadad Adel also repeated Iran's insistence that Britain should
recognise that the 15 sailors and marines trespassed into Iranian
territorial waters when they were seized on March 23.


"The British should confess that they made a mistake and they
should no longer commit such moves," said Hadad Adel.


Britain maintains that the group was carrying out routine anti-
smuggling operations in Iraqi waters but Iran says that their
Global Positioning System (GPS) devices show they intruded into
Iranian waters.
