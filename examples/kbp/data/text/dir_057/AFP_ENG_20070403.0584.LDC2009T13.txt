The head of the Italian church and the archbishop of Genoa,
Monsignor Angelo Bagnasco, has been placed under police
protection after hostile graffiti was daubed on his cathedral,
the ANSA news agency reported on Tuesday.


The decision was taken following the discovery of the words
"Shame on Bagnasco" written in white paint on the entrance of the
San Lorenzo cathedral in Genoa.


The graffiti was found on Monday, the day after Bagnasco had
sparked a furious reaction when he appeared to compare same sex
partnerships to incest or paedophilila during Sunday mass.


Bagnasco, in line with much of the Roman Catholic Church in
Italy, is opposed to Italian proposals to recognise civil
partnerships between unmarried couples, both heterosexual and
homosexual.


No details were given of the security measures to be taken.
