Chinese Internet users are turning to "online tombs" as an easier
way to pay respects to deceased relatives and others during an
annual festival to honour the dead, state media reported on
Wednesday.


At least five million people have logged on to websites allowing
them to offer the dead everything from simple messages to the
burning of electronic versions of incense in the run-up to the
yearly Tomb Sweeping Festival on Thursday, the Beijing News
reported.


Chinese turn out in droves for the festival each year to clean
the graves and tombs of their ancestors as a sign of respect,
leaving behind myriad offerings to comfort them in the afterlife.


Beijing's government is trying to promote the use of websites,
typically set up by public cemeteries, to cut down on the traffic
jams that coincide with the festival each year, the paper said.


The five million who used the online route have done so since
April 1. Tomb sweeping activities typically begin about two weeks
before the actual festival.


The paper said the huge growth in online offerings is likely due
in large part to an increase in people paying respects to revered
historical figures rather than direct relatives.
