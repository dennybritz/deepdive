Sick of the hullabaloo over India's dismal performance at the
cricket World Cup, a string of villages in the north of the
country have banned the game.


Elders from 28 villages in Jind district decided enough was
enough, The Asian Age reported Wednesday.


They met at Uchana, north of New Delhi, on Tuesday as the media
ripped into the failed players and coaching staff and unanimously
declared cricket a "meaningless game," the daily said.


Cricket, a national obsession in the subcontinent, was "no
different from alcoholism or the DJs (disc jockeys) who dish out
noisy and senseless Bollywood songs and western music," the
panchayat or council said.


It went on to decree that "noboby would be permitted to either
play cricket or even watch matches on TV," in the district of
Haryana state


"Any villager who opposes the ban will be ostracised," the
council said, warning that cricket had led youngsters into
gambling rather than instilling a sense of sportsmanship.


Council secretary Jogi Ram said cricket was a foreign sport
imported by the English and had lingered too long in India.


India, one of the pre-tournament favourites, were upset by
Bangladesh in the first match and knocked out in the preliminary
stage last month after a second loss to Sri Lanka.
