The wife of a British soldier killed in Iraq over the weekend
said in an interview that she had received a card from him
celebrating their wedding anniversary on Tuesday.


Danny John Wilson, 28, from the 2nd Battalion, The Duke of
Lancaster's Regiment, died on Sunday after suffering small arms
fire while on patrol in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, leaving
behind his wife and son.


"I actually got an anniversary card from him today, because
obviously the post isn't exactly quick," his wife, Tracey, told
ITV News on Tuesday.


"It's like it's all happening to somebody else. I look at his
picture in the paper and it's just not him to me ... it's not
happening. But I think it will probably start to sink in when I
go to see his body and go to the funeral," she told the
broadcaster.


It was Wilson's second tour in the country, according to the
defence ministry.


The defence ministry said Wilson was earmarked as a future
officer because of his experience, while his commanding officer
Lieutenant Colonel Mark Kenyon said he was "the sort of Kingsman
whom it is a privilege to serve alongside."


Britain has about 7,200 troops in Iraq, most of whom are in Basra
and the surrounding areas, though the government plans to
withdraw around 1,500 soldiers this year.
