Australia's central bank on Wednesday left interest rates on hold
at a six-year high of 6.25 percent, despite intense speculation
of a hike to prevent the economy from overheating.


The move surprised many economists who had predicted that the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would put the rate up 25 basis
points in a bid to prevent the country's booming economy from
fuelling inflation.


But analysts warned the reprieve could prove short-lived with
financial markets betting on a rise in May if inflation figures
due out on April 24 show that rate increases last year have
failed to dampen price pressures.


The market is increasingly expecting the central bank to lift
official rates before the end of the year as stronger-than-
expected retail sales and credit growth bolster jitters that the
economy could be travelling too fast.


RBA Assistant Governor Malcolm Edey warned last month that the
outlook for inflation was "higher than ideal" and that "some of
the factors pushing up underlying inflation last year remain in
place".


But exporters had feared that a rate rise would hurt them by
further strengthening the Australian dollar, which has hit
10-year highs against the US greenback.


The next meeting of the RBA is scheduled for May 1, with an
announcement expected the following day.
