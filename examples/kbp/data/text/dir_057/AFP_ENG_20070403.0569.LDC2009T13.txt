Brett Quigley departed Augusta National Golf Club during a
practice round for his first Masters here Tuesday to attend the
birth of his first child.


But the 37-year-old American might yet be able to achieve both of
his dreams this week, joining wife Amy in Florida for Wednesday's
expected birth of their daughter and returning in time to tee off
Thursday in his first Masters.


"This is a very accommodating baby," Quigley said. "Our prayers
are that everything goes well and both Amy and the baby are fine.
I hope to get back to Augusta (Wednesday) night or Thursday
morning."


Quigley was placed in the second-to-last group of the opening
round with Fiji's Vijay Singh and Japan's Hideto Tanihara, giving
him up to 2:03 p.m. local time Thursday to make it back to
Magnolia Lane.


Quigley spoke with his wife before teeing off for a morning
practice round with Americans Lucas Glover and Jeff Sluman.


But after finishing the 11th hole, Quigley checked his cellular
telephone for messages and it rang. His wife's water had broken
and Quigley was off from Amen Corner, receiving a cart ride back
to the clubhouse.


"There was no hesitation. I told them I needed to go," Quigley
said.
