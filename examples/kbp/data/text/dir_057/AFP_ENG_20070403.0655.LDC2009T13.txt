New York Knicks coach Isiah Thomas was fined 50,000 dollars for
"public criticisms" of the National Basketball Association
officials after he defended his star player on the weekend.


The fine was announced by NBA executive vice president of
basketball operations Stu Jackson, who responded after Thomas
made comments about how he perceived Stephon Marbury's
penetration game was officiated.


After Saturday's 103-94 road loss to the New Orleans Hornets,
Thomas said Marbury did not get the calls other star players get
when they drive to the basket. Marbury was stripped of the ball
on a drive late in regulation.


"I've never said this before but I think it needs to be made, how
Marbury is being treated by the officials," Thomas said.


"I don't understand why a guy for all his career has been a
player who drives to the basket and get to the foul line. I don't
understand what he has done, or why he is getting the lack of
respect he is getting from the officials."


A 10-year veteran and two-time All-Star, Marbury ranks 28th in
the NBA in free throws. He also ranks 16th in 3-point attempts.


"I would hope he would be treated like other star players are
treated," Thomas also said. "There is only so much a player can
take before it starts to affect his game. He is officiated
differently than other guards in this game."


The Knicks (31-42) are just 2-8 since Thomas was given a contract
extension by owner James Dolan.  They are 10th in the Eastern
Conference, three games out of the final playoff spot.
