Voters braved heavy rains in a tropical storm Wednesday to have
their say on revisions to Madagascar's constitution, criticised
by the opposition for giving more power to the president.


Only a few voters turned out when polling stations opened at 7 am
(0400 GMT).


"Only 15 people came in the first hour," said Michel Rasolofo,
head of a polling station in the capital. "But with this rain,
it's no surprise. I think voters will come later."


Proposed revisions to the text include eliminating the autonomy
of six provinces and making English an official language of the
former French colony, alongside French and Malagasy.


The opposition claims the main aim of the text is to give more
powers to the president. The new constitution contains a clause
permitting the head of state to legislate by decree in emergency
situations.


Some seven million voters, out of a population of around 18
million, were voting in 17,500 polling stations. Voting was due
to close at 6 pm (1500 GMT) and results were expected within
three days.


Madagascar's constitution dates back to its independence from
France in 1960 and was last revised in 1998.


Nearly 70 percent of Madagascar's population live in abject
poverty, with the country ranked among the world's 30 most
impoverished nations in terms of human development.
