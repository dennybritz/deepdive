Philippine police on Tuesday ruled out abduction by communist
guerrillas as the reason for the disappearance of a US Peace
Corps volunteer.


Julia Campbell, 40, was last seen on April 8 in Banaue town, in
northern Luzon. She had told friends she was going on a hiking
trip.


The US embassy in Manila has appealed for any information about
her whereabouts, and US Peace Corps director Ronald Tschetter
arrived here late Monday to help in the search.


A former journalist, Campbell, of Fairfax, Virginia, has been in
the Philippines since 2005 and has been working as a teacher at a
college in eastern Legaspi city.


Communist New People's Army (NPA) guerrillas in 1990 kidnapped a
Peace Corps volunteer but freed him shortly afterwards.


Regional police spokesman Superintendent Joseph Adnol said there
"is no indication" that Campbell has been abducted by the NPA,
which has been waging a Maoist rebellion since 1969.


The area where Campbell was last seen is free of the NPA and the
crime rate there is low, he said.


Police teams have also fanned out across the mountainous area to
search for Campbell, due to fears she may have had an accident.


Campbell's colleagues and family "are not losing any hope as the
search continues," said US embassy spokesman Matthew Lussenhop.
