The environmental group Greenpeace demonstrated Tuesday in front
of the Italian embassy in Budapest against plans by Italian
energy giant ENEL to complete two nuclear reactors in Slovakia.


About 30 protesters dressed up as Roman soldiers demonstrated
against the "dangerous nature" of the nuclear plant in Mochovce,
where the majority-state- owned ENEL is set to complete a third
and fourth nuclear reactor by 2013.


The two new reactors would be built on the same model as the two
existing ones although the technology at the plant is over 40
years old and obsolete, Greenpeace said.


It also accused Rome of double standards after it decided in 1987
to shut down all Italian nuclear power plants for security
reasons.


"To export these security risks to a third country is not
acceptable," Greenpeace said in a petition handed to an embassy
official.
