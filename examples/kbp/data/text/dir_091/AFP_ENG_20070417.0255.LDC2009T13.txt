The referee in charge of Real Madrid's 2-1 weekend defeat by
Racing Santander said Tuesday that he fears for his family's
safety after receiving telephone death threats following the
game.


"I have received more than 50 phone calls at my home threatening
me and my family with death. I like being a referee and I do it
with honour and dignity but I have a family and it's hard,"
Javier Turienzo Alvarez told Punto Radio.


"I have a six-year-old daughter who returned from the park
yesterday crying. My daughter said: 'the children tell me you
ruined things for Real'... and it hurts me to the core," he
added.


Alvarez enraged Real fans when he awarded Santander two penalties
in the last 20 minutes of Saturday's match and sent off two Real
Madrid players, Ivan Helguera and Alvaro Mejia, in the 87th and
90th minutes respectively.


Real's defeat, coupled with Barcelona's 1-0 home win over
Mallorca on Sunday, left the nine-times European champions five
points adrift of their bitter rivals in the title race.


Real sports director Predrag Mijatovic criticized the refereeing
after the match, saying "some very strange things have happened".


"It isn't normal what they have done to us," he added.


Alvarez rejected Mijatovic's comments and lodged a complaint over
the treats with a court in the northwestern city of Leon where he
lives.


"There is nothing strange going on. Everyone makes mistakes --
players, directors, referees," he said.


Alvarez told the radio station he recorded several telephone
numbers from which the threatening calls originated.
