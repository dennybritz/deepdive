Two people were arrested in Sweden on Tuesday suspected of
involvement in a major insider trading ring, bringing to four the
number of people arrested so far, the Swedish Economic Crimes
Bureau said on Tuesday.


"Prosecutor Robert Engstedt has given himself until Thursday at
noon to decide whether to charge the four people," bureau
spokeswoman Eva-Lisa Lennstrand told AFP, remaining tight-lipped
about the details of the case.


She said the pair arrested on Monday were the masterminds behind
the ring. One of them was employed at Swedish bank Nordea and the
other at risk capital fund Cevian.


One of the two reportedly pocketed 50 million kronor (5.42
million euros, 7.34 million dollars) over several years,
according to Swedish news agency TT.


TT said neither of the two arrested on Tuesday worked at Nordea
or Cevian.


The Economic Crimes Bureau did not disclose the identities or
nationalities of the four.


According to TT, the prosecutor's refusal to disclose any details
of the case could be a sign that further arrests were to come.


On Monday, Engstedt said the insider trading case was "one of the
biggest ever" in Sweden.


The four suspects are all in their 30s and acted on various
international markets, according to media reports.


They risk up to four years in prison if convicted of insider
trading.
