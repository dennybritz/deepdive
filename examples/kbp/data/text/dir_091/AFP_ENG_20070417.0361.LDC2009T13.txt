US shares edged higher at the opening Tuesday as the market kept
some momentum from a big rally in the prior session and generally
positive economic and corporate news.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted up 12.97 points (0.11
percent) to 12,714.20 while the Nasdaq composite lost 1.44 points
(0.06 percent) to 2,516.89 in the first exchanges.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index edged up 1.00
points (0.07 percent) to 1,469.47.


Traders mulled generally positive economic news.


US housing starts increased 0.8 percent in March, the Commerce
Department said in a report defying many forecasts for more
declines in the troubled property market.


A separate report showed US consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in
March but the "core" inflation rate that excludes volatile food
and energy costs showed a modest 0.1 percent rise.


Earnings from Coca-Cola followed a recent trend of beating market
expectations, setting a positive tone.


"The stock market's reaction to the early wave of first quarter
earnings reports now resembles the reaction we saw last October,"
said Fred Dickson at DA Davidson.


"However, we have to question whether the market may be
overreacting to results that, while coming in better than
estimated, lacks the fundamental strength of the results we
observed last fall. Technically, the current market appears
powerful, but it is lacking in trading volume.  We suspect some
of the enthusiasm is coming from a halo effect from the steady
stream of merger announcements."
