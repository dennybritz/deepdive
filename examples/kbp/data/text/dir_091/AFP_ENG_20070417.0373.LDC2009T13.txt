Spanish police have detained 21 people, including three notaries,
in the southern coastal province of Malaga on suspicion of money
laundering, the interior ministry said Tuesday.


The operation, which is ongoing, focused on the activities of a
law firm in the upmarket resort of Marbella which police suspect
set up front companies to launder money earned from various
illegal activities, the ministry said in a statement.


Two of the 21 detained in the sweep had already been arrested as
part of Operation White Whale, the biggest strike against money
laundering ever carried out in Spain which got underway in March
2005.


About 50 people of various nationalities were arrested on charges
of laundering more than 250 million euros (340 million US
dollars) for gangs involved in murder, drug trafficking, arms
dealing and prostitution.


Spain's Costa del Sol, a coastal strip where the former fishing
village of Marbella is located, has long played host to a number
of international criminal gangs, earning the nickname "Costa del
Crime".
