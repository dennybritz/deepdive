At least 60 cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)
have been detected this year in the southern African kingdom of
Swaziland, the health ministry said on Tuesday.


Themba Dlamini, Swaziland's tuberculosis programmes manager, said
that none of those with the disease had died but added that they
had all been placed in isolated wards in hospital.


"The country has had 8,500 reported cases of TB and 60 were found
to be MDR-TB cases. All are on treatment and we are working
around the clock to create awareness about the disease," Dlamini
told AFP.


MDR strains thwart the first line of antibiotics that are
conventionally used to treat TB.


Around 450,000 new MDR-TB cases are estimated to occur every
year, according to recent estimates by the World Health
Organisation (WHO).


The WHO believes that around nine million TB infections occur
annually.
