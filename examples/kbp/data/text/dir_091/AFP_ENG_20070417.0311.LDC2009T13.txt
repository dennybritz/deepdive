US consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in March as energy costs shot
higher, the government reported Tuesday.


The Labor Department's consumer price index (CPI) was nonetheless
below market expectations for a 0.7 percent increase.


Also, the "core" inflation rate that excludes volatile food and
energy costs showed a modest 0.1 percent rise against
expectations for a 0.2 percent increase.


Over the past year, consumer prices are up 2.8 percent overall
and 2.5 percent for the core inflation rate.


The rise in March was led by a 5.8 percent surge in energy costs,
the largest since September 2005. Energy costs rose 22.9 percent
in the first three months of the year.


Food prices increased 0.3 percent in March and 7.3 percent for
the first quarter.


Real average weekly earnings, which are adjusted for inflation,
fell 0.1 percent in March, while average hourly earnings, which
are not adjusted for inflation, rose 0.3 percent in the month.
