A Dnepr rocket successfully launched a payload of Egyptian, Saudi
and US satellites into orbit on Tuesday after taking off from
Kazakhstan's Baikonur cosmodrome, organisers said.


The payload carried by the Ukrainian-Russian rocket included one
satellite belonging to Egypt, six belonging to Saudi Arabia and
seven tiny research satellites developed by universities in the
United States and Colombia, said launch organiser Kosmotras, in a
statement.


Kosmotras is a Russian-Ukrainian joint venture.


It was the first Dnepr launch since another Dnepr carrying 18
satellites crashed after take-off last July, scattering debris
over a wide area of Kazakhstan.


The design of the launcher is based on an intercontinental
ballistic missile.


Following last year's accident, Russia was obliged to pay one
million dollars (740,000 euros) to Kazakhstan to compensate for
the ecological damage caused.
