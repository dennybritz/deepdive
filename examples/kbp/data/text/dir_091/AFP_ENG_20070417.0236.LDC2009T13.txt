An assailant on Tuesday shot the mayor of the southern Japanese
city of Nagasaki, officials said.


A police official said Iccho Ito, the mayor of the city that
famously suffered a 1945 atom bomb attack, was shot in the back.


Television footage showed police tackling a suspect.


Gun violence is rare in Japan, which strictly controls arms
possession.
