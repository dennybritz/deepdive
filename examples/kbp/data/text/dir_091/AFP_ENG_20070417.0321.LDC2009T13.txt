Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Tuesday he expects German
goalkeeper Jens Lehmann to sign an extension to his contract to
keep him at the English giants.


With the 37-year-old's contract up at the end of the season, the
German international had been linked to a move back to the
Bundesliga to join Hertha Berlin, but Wenger expects to keep him
in North London.


"I expect he will stay," the Arsenal manager told Arsenal TV.


The 13-times English champions have already offered Lehmann an
extension, having joined them from Borussia Dortmund in 2003, and
the German has already said he is happy to stay.


"I have always said that I enjoy playing here, but no decision
has yet been taken," said Lehmann.


"I expect to be able to make an announcement in the next few days
or next week," he said.
