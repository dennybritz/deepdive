Gulf Air, the Bahrain-based airline, is losing more than one
million US dollars a day, its chief executive Andre Dose said on
Tuesday as he unveiled a plan to cut its fleet and jobs.


Over the next two years, the airline will reduce the number of
its aircraft to 28 from 34 and become an all Airbus fleet.


The aircraft will also undergo a refurbishment programme at the
cost of 190 million Bahraini dinars (505 million US dollars).


Cuts will be made to the airline's 6,000-strong workforce, but it
has yet to announce how many jobs will go and when.


"We are fully aware that these are harsh measures and we have
tough times ahead of us," Dose told reporters at the airline's
Manama headquarters. "But we need these measures to secure the
survival of the company."


Gulf Air Deputy Chairman Mahmood Al Kooheji said the loss of one
million dollars a day "would even be substantially higher" if
other costs such as financing were factored in.


Accumulated losses and costs, including 2007, would amount to 254
million Bahraini dinars (675 million US dollars), Kooheji said.


Dose said the frequency of flights to key destinations would be
increased  and new connections would be added to growing economic
centres.


Loss-making flights to Dublin, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Johannesburg,
Sydney and Singapore will be stopped, in favour of concentrating
more on destinations in the Gulf and wider Middle East.


Founded in 1974, Gulf Air is owned equally by the governments of
Bahrain and Oman, after Qatar and Abu Dhabi pulled out in 2002
and 2005 respectively.
