Pete Sampras will make his first trip to Greece next month to
play in Athens when the 30-and-over Champions Series stages its
first tennis tournament outside of North America.


Sampras, a 14-time Grand Slam winner and an American of Greek
heritage, headlined a field announced by promoters here Tuesday
that also will include Mark Philippoussis, the first active ATP
player to play in a Champions event.


Australia's Philippoussis, also of Greek ancestry, and Sampras
will be joined by 1996 Wimbledon winner Richard Krajicek, three-
time French Open winner Mats Wilander, 1987 Wimbledon champion
Pat Cash, former number one Jim Courier, two- time Grand Slam
runner-up Todd Martin and an unrevealed last competitor.


The event will be staged at the Olympic tennis facility used for
the 2004 Athens Summer Games.


"Playing in Greece is going to be very exciting," Sampras said.


"This event will give me the chance to see the country, meet the
people and allow me to play with a different kind of pride as a
Greek-American playing in the land of my heritage."
