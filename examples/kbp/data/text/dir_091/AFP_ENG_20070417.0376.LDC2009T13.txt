The same gun was used in two shootings at Virginia Tech
University, suggesting only one gunman killed 32 people and
himself, police said Tuesday.


"The ballistics test says that one of the weapons used in Norris
Hall was also used in the (first) shooting," Colonel Steve
Flaherty, Superintendent of Virginia State Police, told a press
conference.


"It certainly is reasonable for us to assume that Cho (Seung-Hui)
was the shooter in both places but we don't have the evidence to
take us there at this particular point in time," he said.


Thirty-three people, including Cho, died in two separate
shootings more than two hours apart on Monday in the deadliest
school shooting in US history.


Flaherty could not exclude the possibility however that Cho had
help carrying out the massacre.


"But we are exploring whether or not there was someone that may
or may not have helped Cho at any point during his planning or
his execution of this particular event," he said.
