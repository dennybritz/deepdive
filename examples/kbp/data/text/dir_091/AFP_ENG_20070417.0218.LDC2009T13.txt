Privately-owned Israeli airline Israir has placed a firm order
for three Airbus medium-haul A320 aircraft, becoming the European
company's first customer in Israel, Airbus said on Tuesday.


Airbus declined when questioned by AFP to give the value of the
contract. At catalogue prices, it is worth 219 million dollars
(161-million-euros).


In late December Israir had announced the signature of a 150
-million-dollar agreement for two A-320s, with an option to buy a
third.


It is the first time that an Israeli company has bought an
Airbus. Israeli airlines having traditionally opted for aircraft
manufactured by US rival Boeing.
