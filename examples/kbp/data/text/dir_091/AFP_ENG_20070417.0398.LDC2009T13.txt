Coalition forces in Afghanistan have intercepted Iranian-made
mortars and explosives that were destined for the Taliban, the
top US military chief said Tuesday.


General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said the weapons were intercepted in the Kandahar region within
the past month but it was not known if any elements of the
Iranian government were involved.


"It is not as clear in Afghanistan which Iranian entity is
responsible. But we have intercepted weapons in Afghanistan
headed for the Taliban that were made in Iran," he told defense
reporters here.


"We do not know with the same clarity that we know in Iraq who
was involved. So the fact that we know is: made in Iran, being
delivered to the Taliban in Afghanistan, being intercepted by
coalition forces. That's all we know about (it)," he said.


Pace said the weapons intercepted were mortars and C-4-type
explosives.


He said it was unclear whether they were shipped directly from
Iran or via another more tortuous route.


Senior US officials have repeatedly accused the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force of arming and training
Shiite militias in Iraq for attacks on US forces.


But Pace's remarks suggest high level concern that the Iranians
may now be expanding those operations into Afghanistan, where a
NATO-led force is confronted with the biggest Taliban resurgence
since its ouster in 2001.
