An alliance of Sunni groups headed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq said it
has executed 20 Iraqi policemen it kidnapped last week in the
north of the country, in an Internet statement posted on Tuesday.


"After the period expired given by the Islamic State of Iraq to
the infidel government of (Iraqi Prime Minister) Maliki about the
20 personnel of the interior and defence ministries, the sharia
(Islamic) court has decided to implement the rule of God on
them," the Islamic State of Iraq said.


The group said a video of the executions would be posted on-line.
