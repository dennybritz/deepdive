French nuclear group Areva said on Tuesday it was extending until
May 4 its bid for German German wind turbine maker REpower, which
is also being hunted by India's Suzlon Energy.


The offer was originally to run until April 20, and as a
consequence the Indian company's rival offer has been prolonged
as well.


Last week Suzlon Suzlon Wind Energie, the German unit of Suzlon,
said in a statement that the Indian wind turbine manufacturer had
increased its bid to 150 euros per REpower share.


The improved offer topped Areva's bid of 140 euros per share.
