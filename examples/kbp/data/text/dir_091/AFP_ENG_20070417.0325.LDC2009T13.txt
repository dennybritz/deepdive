The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said Tuesday it will sack 80
employees, including some senior management officials, in the
wake of the national team's World Cup fiasco.


Pakistan were ousted from the tournament after a humiliating
defeat by minnows Ireland on March 17. Coach Bob Woolmer was
found murdered in his hotel room the next day.


A PCB press release said 80 employees would be "relieved from
their positions with severance pay" after a review of its
management structure by external consultants.


"The decision to terminate their services was taken on corporate
lines," PCB marketing director Ahsan Malik told AFP.


PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Nagmi was quoted by state
media as saying that the aim was to restructure the board
"ensuring good governance and (the) right man for the right job."


"Some of the previous employees were not even known to their job
description and they were not performing their duties to a level
of satisfaction. Besides, they were not suitable in the new
structure," he said.
