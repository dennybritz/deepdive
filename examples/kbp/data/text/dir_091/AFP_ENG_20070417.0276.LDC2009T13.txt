EU regulators are set to fine brewers including giants Heineken
and InBev on Wednesday for participating in an illegal cartel in
The Netherlands, informed sources said on Tuesday.


The European Commission, the European Union's competition
watchdog, declined to comment on the matter when questioned by
AFP.


The Commission's trustbusters launched a probe at the beginning
of the decade into unfair practices by brewers, leading in
September 2005 to formal charges being lodged.


According to a source close to the matter, Heineken, Interbrew --
which has since become InBev -- Royal Grolsch and Bavaria shared
sensitive information about prices and carved up the market among
themselves, keeping prices artificially high.


Unconvinced by their defence, the Commission is set to fine the
companies sums that will only be determined at the last moment.


Shares in Heineken were down 1.07 percent at 38.61 euros, Grolsch
was down 1.58 percent at 31.64 euros in Amsterdam while InBev
stock was down 0.40 percent at 56.75 euros. Bavaria is a
privately held company.
