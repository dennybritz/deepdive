The European Union welcomed Tuesday a reform action plan unveiled
by Turkey aimed at bringing the cuontry into line with norms
needed to join the bloc.


"This is, of course, very much welcomed by the European
Commission that Turkey adopted such a road map and this is what
is actually expected from any candidate country," a spokeswoman
on enlargement issues told reporters.


She said however that it was too early for the EU's executive
body to comment on the content of the plan -- essentially a
programme of technical reforms and a timetable for Turkey to
achieve them by 2013.


The spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which Turkey
undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins Europe's rich
club.


Turkey's membership talks, which began in October 2005 and have
been plagued with difficulties, are expected to last at least a
decade and Ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even
be allowed in at the end.


Many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge, relatively
poor and mainly- Muslim state which would, under EU rules, have
voting rights similar to major powers like Britain or Italy.


Candidates for membership are required to adopt norms in 35
policy areas. Owing to a trade dispute with EU member Cyprus,
Turkey is currently allowed to open chapters but not to close
them.
