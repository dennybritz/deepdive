Hong Kong's booming financial houses underpay their junior staff
and overpay their senior financiers, a survey of pay scales in
the Chinese city revealed Tuesday.


Compared to other major world business centres, Hong Kong's
entry-level finance and accountancy employees get far lower
salaries, posing a threat to the city's future as a financial
powerhouse.


"It's feasible that Hong Kong could see a shortage of candidates
in entry level positions as young professionals are lured to
better paid positions in markets like London, Australia and New
Zealand," said Andrew Brushfield, director of finance sector
recruitment company Robert Half International.


"We also can't ignore the opportunities presented by mainland
China for ambitious young people," Brushfield added.


The survey, entitled "International Financial Salary Guide 2007",
found that middle and upper management in Hong Kong earned more
than their counterparts overseas.


Treasurers in Hong Kong, for instance, are paid on average
200,000 Hong Kong dollars (25,600 US dollars) more salary per
year than their counterparts in London and New York and 100,000
dollars more than those in Singapore.


With an economy that grew almost 7 percent last year, Hong Kong's
job market is buoyant. Economists forecast the city will reach
statistical full employment this year after joblessness fell to a
nine-year low of 4.4 percent.
