At least two people were killed Tuesday in a fire fanned by a
fierce sandstorm in Cairo which halted all flights at the main
airport and delayed the arrival of US Defence Secretary Robert
Gates, a police source said.


The two died when the fire, triggered by a flame from a gas stove
and fanned by strong winds, set some 50 homes ablaze in the
village of Atalia in the Nile Delta governorate of Menufiyah, the
source told AFP. Eight other people suffered burns.


The blaze swept through the village due to strong winds and the
fact that roofs are often made of palm tree stems.


Some 30 firetrucks were deployed to control the fire.


Meanwhile, air traffic had by late afternoon partially resumed at
Cairo international airport after a five-hour interruption which
left thousands of passengers stranded.


"The resumption of normal traffic should take several hours," the
official MENA news agency reported.


All take-offs and landings had been interrupted during the
sandstorm "which cut visibility to fewer than 500 metres (yards),
which is 300 metres below the necessary field of vision,"
operations director General Abdel Fattah Badran told reporters.


Two flights -- one from Sudan and one from Luxor in upper Egypt
-- were diverted to Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh,
Badran added.


The US Defence Secretary, who is on a Middle East tour, was due
in Cairo around 1.30 pm (1130 GMT) but was stuck in Amman because
of the storm.
