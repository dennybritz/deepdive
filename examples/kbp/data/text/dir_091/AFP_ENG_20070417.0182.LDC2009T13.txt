The Shanghai stock exchange investigated 280 "suspect
transactions" last year, nearly twice the figure from 2005, the
bourse said in a statement Tuesday.


"Suspect transactions" refer to trades where malpractice such as
price manipulation and insider dealings are suspected, according
to the statement.


An earlier statement said it investigated 147 similar cases in
2005.


Tuesday's statement said the increase was mainly due to stepped-
up supervision.
