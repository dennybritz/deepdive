A German army instructor who ordered a recruit to imagine he was
firing at African-Americans in New York during a shooting
exercise has been discharged, the defence ministry said Tuesday.


The soldier, who was not identified, will lose his military rank
and outstanding pay and benefits. A soldier who captured the
incident on video is facing an investigation, the ministry said
in a statement.


The incident occurred in July in a forest near an army barracks
in the northern town of Rendsburg.


It shows the instructor, who is in his twenties, first telling
recruits to imagine they were fighting plane hijackers. At the
end of the exercise he congratulates them, saying, "That's good,
the terrorists are dead."


He then tells them: "Now you're in the Bronx. A black truck stops
in front of you. Three African-Americans get out and insult your
mother grossly. Every time before you pull the trigger I want to
hear you shout 'motherfucker' very loudly."


The junior soldier is then shown executing the order, shouting
the expletive before each shot, encouraged by his superior.


The German army has been dogged by scandals in recent months.


Eighteen army instructors are currently on trial accused of
mistreating recruits during training in 2004.


Last year, photographs surfaced of German soldiers serving in
Afghanistan posing with skulls. An inquiry involving 20 soldiers
was launched, and six have been suspended from duty.
