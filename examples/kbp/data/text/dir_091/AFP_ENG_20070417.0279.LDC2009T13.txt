Ten members of a Malaysian volunteer group that helps officials
round up illegal immigrants were arrested Tuesday for robbing
Indonesian migrant workers, state media said.


Police said they caught the men robbing the workers' quarters in
Ipoh, the capital of northern Perak state.


"All of them were in uniform ... Some of them tried to escape but
were eventually caught," Ipoh's police chief Jalaludin Ibrahim
was quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency.


Jalaludin said the men had instructed the workers to gather
outside their quarters, then searched the premises for valuables.
They worked for RELA, a task force that assists with law
enforcement.


"The same RELA gang had conducted an 'operation' there last
Saturday and took away some of the belongings of the workers.
This time... their leader quickly called the police," he said.


The Indonesian workers lost some 2,000 ringgit (583
dollars)-worth of valuables, including electrical appliances,
phones and clothes, in the Saturday robbery, Bernama said.


Police said the RELA volunteers had been remanded for six days
for investigations.


Migrant workers and rights groups frequently allege harsh and
violent treatment by members of the volunteer corps during their
numerous raids at workers' quarters to detain illegal immigrants.


There are some 2.5 million legal and illegal foreign workers in
Malaysia, and they account for nearly a quarter of the 10.5
-million-strong workforce, official figures show.
