Lawmakers in turbulent Kyrgyzstan voted Tuesday to remove guns
from politics -- their own.


Members of parliament must now hand in weapons as they enter the
legislature, deputy speaker Kubanychbek Isabekov said.


"For a long time there has been a place at the parliament
entrance for depositing weapons," he explained.


Last December, parliament voted to allow lawmakers to pack
weapons in self- defence.


Politics can be dangerous in this mountainous, Central Asian
country.


Street protests take place almost weekly and three members of
parliament have been murdered since a 2005 uprising that ousted
then president Askar Akayev.
