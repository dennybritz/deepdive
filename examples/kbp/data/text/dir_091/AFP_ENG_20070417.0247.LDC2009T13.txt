Iraq's interior ministry on Tuesday firmly denied a claim by an
Al Qaeda-led militant group that it had kidnapped and killed 20
Iraqi policemen.


"The 'Islamic State of Iraq' is claiming it kidnapped a number of
police. We checked the report and we found out it was untrue. It
is a misleading report," said Brigadier General Abdel Karim
Khalaf.


Khalaf, the director of the interior ministry national command
centre, said: "It is funny that they are speaking about
kidnapping... Our police reports say no policemen are missing."


Separately, defence ministry spokesman Mohammed al-Askari said no
Iraqi soldiers were missing.


Earlier, the Islamic State of Iraq -- an alliance of Sunni groups
headed by Al- Qaeda -- said in an Internet message that it had
executed 20 Iraqi policemen kidnapped last week north of Baghdad.


The group promised to release a video to prove their claim.
