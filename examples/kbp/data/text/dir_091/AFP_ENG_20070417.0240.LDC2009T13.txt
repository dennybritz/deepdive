Rescue workers on Tuesday found the body of the last person
missing after flash floods hit two waterfalls in southern
Thailand, bringing the death toll from the tragedy to 38.


Local police chief Colonel Sonthichai Awatanakulthep said that
rescuers found the body of Yuwada Choosrirak, a 31-year-old
woman, on Tuesday afternoon, three days after the floods stuck.


"We have already stopped searching for victims as no more people
have been reported missing," he told AFP.


Thirty-eight people were killed after torrents of water poured
over two waterfalls on Saturday as families bathed or enjoyed
picnics at the popular tourist sites in Trang province, 700
kilometres (440 miles) south of Bangkok.


Police had expressed hope of finding survivors, but since Sunday
have pulled only bodies from the water. Hospital officials said
that most of the victims were hit by rocks or drowned after the
powerful water knocked them down.


Seventeen of the victims were children. One of the dead was from
Laos, the authorities said on Sunday, while the rest were Thai.


More than 100 people were swimming in the waters when the flash
floods struck Sairung and Prai Sawan waterfalls, which are about
five kilometres apart and whose names translate as "rainbow" and
"heavenly jungle."


The waterfalls were particularly crowded because of the five-day
Songkran holiday weekend celebrating Buddhist New Year, when
Thais traditionally head home or into the countryside for some of
the hottest days of the year.
