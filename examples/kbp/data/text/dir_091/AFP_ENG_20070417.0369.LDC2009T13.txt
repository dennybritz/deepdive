Chaos erupted in a small village in rural Malawi on Tuesday when
Madonna and the one-year-old boy she hopes to adopt arrived at
the orphanage where she found him.


Scores of international and local journalists tried to force
their way into the orphanage to get closer to Madonna, and were
confronted by some 500 angry orphans who threw stones at them.


Orphanage officials attempted to calm the children down, and
called two police officers who evicted journalists from the "Home
of Hope" at the foot of Mchinji mountain.


The US pop star, who is in the country for a three-day trip, was
visiting projects she had funded around the country, and was
expected to re-unite her prospective son with his biological
father.


Hundreds of villagers swarmed to the orphanage to witness the
chaotic scene, as Madonna and Malawi-born David were safely
ensconced inside the building, hidden from reporters.


Orphans aged up to 22 chanted slogans encouraging police to chase
journalists away.


"I didn't expect that this would come from the orphanage. I
thought they would have handled it better rather than mobilise
the orphans to throw stones at international journalists," said
local reporter Vitima Ndovi.
