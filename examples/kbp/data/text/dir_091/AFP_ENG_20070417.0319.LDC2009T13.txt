Blackburn boss Mark Hughes has dismissed reports that Morten
Gamst Pedersen could be on his way to Manchester United as a
long-term replacement for veteran winger Ryan Giggs.


Tuesday's Daily Mirror claimed Norwegian star Pedersen had become
a target for United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, anxious to ensure he
has cover as 33-year-old Giggs nears the end of his career.


But Hughes is determined to hang on to one of his biggest assets.


"I spent last summer fending off interest in my players, because
they had an exceptional season, and I'm sure we'll have other
offers this summer," the Blackburn manager told Sky Sports News.


"But the situation with Morten is that he signed a new contract,
he was happy to do so because he knows this is the best place for
him. Both parties are happy with that situation."


Ferguson is a long-standing admirer of Pedersen and considered
signing him before he joined Blackburn in 2004.
