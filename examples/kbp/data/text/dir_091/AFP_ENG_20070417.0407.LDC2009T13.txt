Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"Once we realised we had the semi-final spot I thought we needed
to give those guys a break."


- Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene on the controversial
decision to rest Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan for the
match against Australia which they lost by seven wickets.


"It's not the way we would have done it but they're a different
team. They are key players. It can affect confidence when you do
that."


- Andrew Symonds mystified by the absence of Vaas and
Muralitharan.


"The chicken dance came out of when I am out on the dancefloor,
the guys say I look like a chicken so that's just a celebratory
dance I've given to the guys."


- Ireland captain Trent Johnston on his bizarre way of
celebrating a wicket


"We'll look to knock him over early."


- South Africa skipper Graeme Smith on his plans for Kevin
Pietersen in Tuesday's grudge match.


"He's taking a lot of wickets with his 'wrong-un' and he's
bowling it very well. More importantly, he's probably thinking
through his bowling a lot better now than he ever has."


- Australia skipper Ricky Ponting on spinner Brad Hogg.
