Greece reiterated Tuesday its support for Turkey's bid to join
the European Union despite opposition in France, where the
question has entered the presidential election debate.


"Our position is clear, realistic and sincere -- Turkey must be
fully integrated if it fully conforms to the conditions of
adhesion," a foreign affairs spokesman told reporters.


He was responding to questions about Turkey's prospects for
integration in the light of the first round of the French
presidential election on Sunday.


Leading right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy opposes the mainly
Muslim country's bid to become a full member of the club, while a
survey of French people in October last year showed 58 percent
were opposed.


The Greek spokesman said the debate would continue to evolve in
France after the election.


"Once the election is over we will see how the political dialogue
on Turkey will evolve," he said.


Greece believes genuine reform in Turkey as required by Brussels
will help guarantee security with its large neighbour, long seen
in Athens as a dangerous rival.
