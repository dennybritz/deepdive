The gunman who killed at least 30 people in a US university was a
23-year-old South Korean student identified as Cho Seung-Hui,
police confirmed Tuesday.


"He was a 23-year-old South Korean here in the US as a resident
alien," campus police chief Wendell Flinchum said in a news
conference, adding that the man's name was Cho Seung-Hui.
