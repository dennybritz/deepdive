A former employee of Swiss private bank Julius Baer handed over
confidential data on German clients to tax authorities in
Germany, sparking an investigation into possible tax evasion, a
bank spokesman said on Tuesday.


The Financial Times Deutschland had reported that the former bank
employee had stolen the data, relating to millions of euros in
various accounts.


German tax authorities examined the list to see if any of the
clients were taking advantage of Swiss banking secrecy to evade
taxation at home, it reported.


A bank spokesman told AFP that the incident dated back to 2002,
and that the bank had taken steps to protect client
confidentiality.


Switzerland has strict laws on banking secrecy. Banks are
forbidden from providing information to domestic or foreign tax
authorities except in cases of criminal investigations or money
laundering.


The country reached an agreement with the European Union in 2004
to levy a withholding tax on interest earned by EU citizens on
assets they might hold in Swiss bank accounts, to discourage tax
evasion.
