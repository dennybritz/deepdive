Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday expressed Britain's deep
shock at the "terrible loss of innocent lives" after a gunman
shot dead more than 30 people at a US university.


The gunman killed 32 people Monday before turning his weapon on
himself at Virginia Tech in the deadliest shooting rampage in
modern US history.


"I would like to express, on behalf of Britain and the British
people, our profound sadness at what has happened and to send the
American people and most especially, of course, the families of
the victims, our sympathy and our prayers," Blair said.


He opened his monthly press conference at his Downing Street
office with the comments.


Queen Elizabeth II was "shocked" and "saddened" to hear the news
and was being kept informed, a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said
Monday.


Along with her husband Prince Philip, the queen is set to pay a
two-day visit to Virginia on May 3 and 4 to commemorate the 400th
anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement. It will be her first
visit to the United States in 16 years.


In New York, British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett opened a
speech to business leaders by saying "how horrified we are by the
shooting... and how our hearts go out to those affected."
