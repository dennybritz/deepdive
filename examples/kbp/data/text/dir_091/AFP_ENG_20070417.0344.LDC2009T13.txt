Nineteen seaweed farm workers were killed when they were swept
away by a fast- rising tide in east China's Jiangsu Province,
state media reported on Tuesday.


The incident occurred Sunday when 21 workers went out to work in
the afternoon while the tide was out, Xinhua news agency said,
quoting rescuers.


The tide began coming back in the evening but the workers failed
to escape in time and drowned in waters that became seven metres
(23 feet) deep, it said.


A rescue effort was organised by local authorities but it only
managed to save two of the workers. By Tuesday, rescuers had
recovered the bodies of three male and 16 female victims.


No other details were given.
