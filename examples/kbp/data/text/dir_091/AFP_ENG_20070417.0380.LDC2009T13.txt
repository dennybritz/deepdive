The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said Tuesday it will sack 80
employees, including some senior management officials, in the
wake of the national team's World Cup fiasco.


Pakistan were ousted from the tournament after a humiliating
defeat by minnows Ireland on March 17. Coach Bob Woolmer was
found murdered in his hotel room the next day.


A PCB press release said 80 employees would be "relieved from
their positions with severance pay" after a review of its
management structure by external consultants.


"The decision to terminate their services was taken on corporate
lines," PCB marketing director Ahsan Malik told AFP.


PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Nagmi was quoted by state
media as saying that the aim was to restructure the board
"ensuring good governance and (the) right man for the right job."


"Some of the previous employees were not even known to their job
description and they were not performing their duties to a level
of satisfaction. Besides, they were not suitable in the new
structure," he said.


Officials said those shown the door included two general managers
plus others from lower tiers of the organisation.


The review of the PCB's staffing levels included a comparison
with other cricket boards, including those in Australia and South
Africa, Nagmi said.


Pakistani cricket chiefs are currently trying to pick a captain
to replace Inzamam-ul-Haq, who stood down after the World Cup.


Younis Khan has already turned down the job.
