The gunman who killed 32 people on a Virginia campus was a
student of Asian origin and may have acted with a second suspect,
the university's president said Tuesday.


In comments carried on ABC television, Charles Steger referred to
the man as the "second shooter," and said investigators were
examining the possibile involvement of "others" in the bloodbath.
