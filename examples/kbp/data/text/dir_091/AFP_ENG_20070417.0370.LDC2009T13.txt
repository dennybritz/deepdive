The gunman who killed at least 30 people in a US university was a
23-year-old South Korean student identified as Cho Seung-Hui,
police confirmed Tuesday.


"He was a 23-year-old South Korean here in the US as a resident
alien," Virginia Tech University campus police chief Wendell
Flinchum said in a news conference, adding that the man's name
was Cho Seung-Hui.


Cho was an undergraduate student in his senior year majoring in
English, Flinchum said. He lived on campus at the Harper Hall
dormitory and his residence was established in Centreville,
Virginia.


Police suspect Cho was the shooter in two incidents in Virginia
Tech buildings which happened just over two hours apart, killing
32 people before turning the gun on himself in the worst school
shooting in US history.


Virginia Tech is an engineering and research university with
about 26,000 full- time students, many of which are on foreign
exchange programs.
