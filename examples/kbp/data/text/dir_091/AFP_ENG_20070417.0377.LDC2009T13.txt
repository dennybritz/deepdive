Coalition forces in Afghanistan haveintercepted Iranian-made
mortars and explosives that were destined for the Taliban, the
top US military chief said Tuesday.


General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said the weapons were intercepted in the Kandahar region within
the past month but it was not known if any elements of the
Iranian government were involved.


"It is not as clear in Afghanistan which Iranian entity is
responsible. But we have intercepted weapons in Afghanistan
headed for the Taliban that were made in Iran," he told defense
reporters here.
