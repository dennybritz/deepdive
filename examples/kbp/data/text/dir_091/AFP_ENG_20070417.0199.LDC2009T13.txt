Andy Murray on Tuesday withdrew before his opening match at the
Monte Carlo Masters after suffering a back injury in doubles a
day earlier.


Murray and his elder brother Jamie had to retire in Monday
doubles as the world number ten from Scotland injured a back
muscle and could not go on after his side lost the first set in a
tiebreaker against Poles Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin
Matkowski.


Murray was to have opened in the second round after a singles bye
against experienced Frenchman Marc Giguel.


The muscular injury was the third for the Scot in a month after
falling over at Indian Wells and injuring his hip, then tweaking
his groin muscle in Miami a fortnight ago.


Murray recovered from the second problem to play one rubber in
Britain's Davis Cup win the Netherlands.
