Brandishing photos of their detained loved ones, thousands of
Palestinians poured into streets throughout the territories on
Tuesday, demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners from
Israeli jails.


Showing photos of many of the 9,000 prisoners held by Israel, and
waving flags of various political factions, men women and
children attended rallies in the West Bank cities of Ramallah,
Hebron, Nablus and Jenin as well as in Gaza City to mark the
annual Prisoners Day.


"No peace without release of all Arab and Palestinian prisoners
from Israeli jails" read one sign in the northern city of Nablus.


At a ceremony kicking off the annual remembrance -- held the
previous day in Gaza -- prime minister Ismail Haniya of Hamas
called for Israel to release all the Palestinian prisoners.


"All the prisoners should be released, not only those who are
included in the exchange" for captured Israeli soldier Gilad
Shalit, Haniya said.


Shalit was seized last June 25 by three groups, including the
armed wing of Hamas, after militants tunnelled out of Gaza and
attacked an Israeli border post in a dawn raid.


Egypt has been mediating drawn-out talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians over a possible prisoner release in exchange for the
soldier.


"No country has stopped talking about Shalit," Haniya said. "His
name is one of the most famous. But who knows the names of... our
prisoners in the prisons of the occupation?"
