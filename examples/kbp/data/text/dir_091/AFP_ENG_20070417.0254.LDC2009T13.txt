A fierce sandstorm halted all flights at Cairo airport on
Tuesday, delaying the arrival in the Egyptian capital of US
Defence Secretary Robert Gates on a Middle East tour, an airport
official said.


"All take-offs and landings have been interrupted at Cairo
airport because of the sandstorm which has cut visibility to
fewer than 500 metres (yards), which is 300 metres below the
necessary field of vision," operations director General Abdel
Fattah Badran told reporters.


Gates was due around 1.30 pm (1130 GMT) but was stuck in Amman
because of the storm in Cairo.


Badran said flights should resume within hours according to the
meteorological service, Badran said.


Two flights -- one from Sudan and one from Luxor in upper Egypt
-- were diverted to Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, he
added.
