Lithuanian lawmakers voted on Tuesday to broaden a ban on ex-KGB
officers holding public posts that could lose the current head of
state security his job.


Previously, only former regular officers of the reviled
communist-era secret police were prevented from holding public
sector jobs. That has now been extended to include former
reservists in the secret police.


One such reservist is the head of the Lithuanian State Security
Department, Arvydas Pocius. Another is lawmaker Antanas Valionis,
a former foreign minister who has been nominated to serve as
Lithuanian ambassador to Argentina.


Both could now lose their jobs.


Fifty-six lawmakers in the 141-member parliament supported
amendments to the so- called lustration law. One voted against
and nine abstained.


The revised law prevents those proscribed from holding government
and ministerial posts, as well as other public institutions, the
army, diplomatic service and state security department.


A special parliamentary commission last year confirmed that both
Pocius and Valionis were included on a list of KGB reserve
officers.


Pocius handed in his resignation in December 2006, but parliament
rejected it in March. Lawmakers plan to vote on Pocius's
resignation once again.


The amendments to the lustration law will come into force after
they have been signed by President Valdas Adamkus, who also has
the right to veto the legislation.
