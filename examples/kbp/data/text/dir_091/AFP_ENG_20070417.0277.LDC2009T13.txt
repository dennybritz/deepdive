Twelve Nigerian police were killed Tuesday when an unknown armed
group stormed and occupied their station in the northern city of
Kano, police said.


An officer at the scene of the stand-off told AFP the group,
including men and women, attacked the suburban police post in
broad daylight, killing the station chief, his wife and 11
officers.


A spokesman for the federal police in Abuja could only confirm
five dead and described the attackers as "fundamentalists".
