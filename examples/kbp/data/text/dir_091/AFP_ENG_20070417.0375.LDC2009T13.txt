Irish rock star Bono told German Chancellor Angela Merkel on
Tuesday that she risked losing credibility if she failed to push
the issue of African poverty to the world's wealthiest nations.


The U2 frontman, a campaigner for third world debt relief, met
Merkel in Berlin and, according to her spokesman, secured a
pledge from the chancellor to use the G8 summit in northern
Germany in June to plead Africa's case.


"I think she is prepared to intervene on behalf of the world's
poorest people provided she can assure the German taxpayers that
their money will not end up in the hands of corrupt dictators,"
Bono told reporters after the meeting.


"She is a wise lady. She understands that we will lose our
credibility if we do not keep our promises," he added.


Germany is the current president of the G8 club of industrialised
nations and Merkel's spokesman said she would put issues such as
improving investment in Africa, supporting sustainable
development and encouraging good governance on the table at the
summit.


Germany has drafted proposals to pair each G8 nation with an
African country in a bid to boost development and democracy.


Bono accused G8 leaders of not living up to the promise they made
at their 2005 summit in Gleneagles in Scotland to more than
double development aid to Africa by 2010.


He said Germany was guilty too and stressed that Merkel's G8
presidency made her the best-placed person in the world to help
the poorest of the poor.


The G8 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Russia and the United States.
