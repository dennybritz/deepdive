Malaysia on Tuesday said legal concerns were holding it back from
joining a US- led global anti-terror initiative aimed at
preventing trafficking in weapons of mass destruction.


US President George W. Bush established the Proliferation
Security Initiative (PSI) in May 2003 as part of his
administration's response to the September 11, 2001 attacks that
killed nearly 3,000 people.


But Malaysia has baulked at joining the initiative for legal
reasons, Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak told a maritime
security conference organised by the US Pacific Command.


"We are still studying it. There are some items in the
Proliferation Security Initiative which the legal side are not so
comfortable with," said Najib, without giving details.


The PSI calls for the interdiction of vessels and airliners
suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction or related
materials and allows for on- board searchs.


The aim of the PSI, which has more than 70 member or observer
nations according to Najib, is to stop militants and rogue states
getting hold of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.


"Malaysia is certainly concerned over proliferation of weapons of
mass destructions and its components and supports the ideals of
PSI," Najib said.


"Malaysia, however, has some reservations with regards to certain
aspects of the initiative which we feel do not conform to
accepted international norms," he added.


Najib, also the defence minister, said Malaysia had been
participating as an observer in PSI exercises for the past two
years, and described defence ties with the US as "good."
