The explosion that killed 108 people in post-Soviet Russia's
worst mining accident was partly caused by someone tampering with
a vital safety system, an official inquiry said Tuesday.


The "equipment was not working because of illegal modifications
carried out on the gas detector after which nobody knew... the
exact quantity of methane in the mine," RIA Novosti quoted the
head of Russia's industrial safety agency Rostekhnadzor as
saying.


The study into the explosion at Siberia's Ulyanovskaya mine on
March 19 also established that poor quality work on electric
cables caused a short circuit, Konstantin Pulikovsky said.


The commission of inquiry ruled that 42 people shared
responsibility for the tragedy, including eight who died in the
explosion, the head of the commission Nikolai Kutin told the news
agency.


The commission has passed its results to Russia's prosecutor's
office, Pulikovsky said.


"This was a conscious crime committed with the aim of increasing
coal production," Kemerovo Governor Aman Tuleyev told the news
agency.


The Ulyanovskaya mine, one of the most modern in Russia, was run
by Yuzhkuzbassugol, a company owned by the Evraz metals giant in
which Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich holds a 41-percent
stake.
