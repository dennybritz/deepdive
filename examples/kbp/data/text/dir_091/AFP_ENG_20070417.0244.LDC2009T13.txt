Indian share prices closed 0.65 percent lower on Tuesday as
investors locked in gains in software stocks after strong
earnings from India's leading software exporters, dealers said.


They said the solid earnings from Tata Consultancy Services this
week and Infosys Technologies last week allayed concerns that a
stronger Indian rupee against the dollar had impacted earnings
for the export-driven companies.


The rupee hit a nine-year high of 41.7 against the dollar Monday,
fuelled by tight monetary policy to contain inflation.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex fell 88.54
points to 13,607.04.


India's largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)
on Monday said fourth quarter net profit soared nearly 44 percent
to 11.95 billion rupees (272 million dollars) from 8.32 billion
rupees in the year-earlier period.


"Investors chose to book profit in software stocks after two days
of sharp gains. We will see select buying in coming days," said
Hiten Mehta, a fund manager with Fortune Financial Services.


Losers led gainers 1,463 to 1,085 on volume of 45.47 billion
rupees (1.09 billion rupees).


The rupee strenghtened against the euro to 56.5 from 57.3.


India's second largest software exporter Infosys fell 46.6 rupees
or 2.19 percent to 2,081.7 while third largest software exporter
Wipro fell 12.4 rupees or 2.11 percent to 574.2 rupees.


Wipro is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings on Friday.
