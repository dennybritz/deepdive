Former Polish president Wojciech Jaruzelski was formally charged
Tuesday with "communist crimes" for declaring martial law in 1981
in a crackdown on the Solidarity trade union.


"Our aim is to fulfill an obligation to the nation and the Polish
state, as well as to all those who suffered injustice and
humiliation during the period of martial law," said Andrzej
Drogon, an official at Poland's National Remembrance Institution
(IPN), which prosecutes communist and Nazi crimes.
