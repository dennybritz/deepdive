An alliance of Sunni groups headed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq said it
has executed 20 Iraqi policemen it kidnapped last week in the
north of the country, in an Internet statement posted on Tuesday.


"After the period expired given by the Islamic State of Iraq to
the infidel government of (Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-) Maliki
about the 20 personnel of the interior and defence ministries,
the sharia (Islamic) court has decided to implement the rule of
God on them," the Islamic State of Iraq said.


The group said a video of the executions would be posted on-line.


In a statement posted on Friday on a website used by Islamist
militants, the group said it was giving the Iraqi government 48
hours to release "Muslim Sunni sisters who are in the prisons of
the interior" ministry.


It also demanded the "turning over of members of the interior
ministry who took part in raping our sister 'Sabrin al-Jarabi'...
and those who killed and displaced our people in (the northern
town of) Tal Afar, and those who participated in raping our
sisters there."


The alleged rape of the woman known by the pseudonym of Janabi,
who appeared in footage broadcast on Arab networks saying she had
been raped by interior ministry officers, triggered a bitter row
at the highest levels in Iraq.


Sunni leaders largely believed her claims, but Maliki, a Shiite,
dismissed them, alleging the rape was invented by Sunni
politicians to tarnish the police at the launch of a Baghdad
security crackdown.
