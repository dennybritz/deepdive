South Africa's mediation efforts in Zimbabwe are at an early
stage and have yet to involve formal talks with the opposition,
deputy foreign minister Aziz Phad told reporters Tuesday.


President Thabo Mbeki was ascertaining exactly what needed to be
done to get negotiations underway between the government of
President Robert Mugabe and the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC), Pahad said.


Mbeki was mandated last month by fellow leaders in the region to
defuse the crisis in Zimbabwe.


"We welcome the statement by (MDC leader) Morgan Tsvangirai last
week that his party is willing to sit down to talk with the
government to end the crisis in Zimbabwe," said Pahad.


"Tsvangirai confirmed receipt of a letter from President Mbeki
... We are at the pre-dialogue stage of the process. Tsvangirai
has provided an initial draft of how he sees the process
unfolding.


"Based on the formal replies from the MDC factions we will
determine a detailed programme of action for the mediation."


Tsvangirai told reporters recently that he welcomed Mbeki's
involvement despite the South African leader's previous failure
to resolve the divisions between the MDC and Mugabe's ZANU-PF
party.


Pahad did not give any details on talks between the Pretoria
government and ZANU-PF, but South Africa's Deputy President
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka is known to have held talks recently with
her Zimbabwean counterpart Joyce Mujuru.


Mugabe has accused the MDC of being puppets in a Western plot to
overthrow his government.
