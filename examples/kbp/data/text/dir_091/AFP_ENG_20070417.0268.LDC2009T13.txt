US President George W. Bush will attend a memorial service
Tuesday at a Virginia university where 33 people were killed in
the worst shooting rampage in modern US history, the White House
said.


"President and Mrs (Laura) Bush will attend the convocation at
Virginia Tech at 2:00 pm (1800 GMT) today," the White House said
in a statement.
