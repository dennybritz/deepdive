At least 47 workers were trapped underground after three coal-
mining accidents in China, state press said Tuesday, again
highlighting lax safety standards.


At least 33 were missing and feared dead after an explosion
ripped through the Wangzhuang coal mine in Henan province late
Monday, the State Administration of Work Safety said.


After rescue operations began, another blast shook the mine in
the Pingdingshan mining region, hampering efforts to locate the
trapped miners, Xinhua news agency said.


Up to a dozen rescuers were injured in the second blast, it said.
Rescue work has resumed.


Police were currently searching for the mine boss and five other
mine officials who were believed to have fled the scene, Xinhua
said.


In the second accident also on Monday, 12 miners were missing
after a flood in the privately run Changcheng mine in Hunan
province, Xinhua said in a separate report.


Heavy rains in Hunan were currently hampering rescue efforts, the
report added.


Separately, two more miners were trapped when a mine collapsed in
northeast China's Heilongjiang province on Monday, Xinhua said.


Provincial coal mine officials said the privately run mine in
Jixi city was not registered with authorities and was operating
illegally.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
