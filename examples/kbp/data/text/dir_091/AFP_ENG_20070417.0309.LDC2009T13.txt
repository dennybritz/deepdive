Twelve Nigerian police were killed Tuesday when an unknown armed
group stormed their station in the northern city of Kano, police
said.


An officer at the scene told AFP the group, including men and
women, attacked the suburban police post in broad daylight,
killing the station chief, his wife and 11 officers.


A spokesman for the federal police in Abuja could only confirm
five dead and described the attackers as "fundamentalists".


The assailants briefly occupied the station and were surrounded,
but escaped into a nearby abandoned building, witnesses said.


Police have sent 40 men to the area as reinforcements.


The bodies of the 13 people killed were taken to the morgue,
police spokesman Baba Mohamed said.


Last Friday armed men gunned down a radical Muslim cleric and two
of his followers in a mosque in a Kano suburb.
