The prime minister of East Timor said Tuesday he was calling off
the hunt for a fugitive rebel leader blamed for last year's
unrest to lure him back to the negotiating table.


"The military operation on Major Reinado has to be stopped to
give a chance for the attorney general, Reinado's lawyers and the
(East Timor) bishops to resume dialogues," Jose Ramos-Horta told
reporters.


"The president will meet parties involved today and tomorrow to
stop the military operations," he added.


Major Alfredo Reinado, a renegade soldier, has been on the run
since crack Australian troops attacked his mountain hideout
earlier last month in a failed bid to capture him.


His refusal to surrender cast a long shadow over impoverished
East Timor's landmark presidential election this month, although
he said he would not disrupt the poll.


Five of his armed supporters were killed during the raid on his
hideout, which triggered rowdy protests.


Reinado has been a persistent problem for East Timor's government
and is said to have a band of armed followers and to enjoy
support from disaffected youths and the backing of an ethnic
group living in the nation's west.


The fugitive was criticised for his role in unrest last year that
killed at least 37 people, displaced 150,000 and led to the
dispatch of Australian-led international peacekeepers.
