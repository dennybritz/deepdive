Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko pledged Tuesday to find a
democratic solution to his country's political crisis and ruled
out the use of force to resolve it.


"We are determined to find a democratic resolution to the
parliamentary crisis in Ukraine," he told reporters in Brussels
after talks with European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso.


"We've never been saying and never (been) crudely speaking about
any option with using force to resolve the situation," he said.


As he spoke, Ukraine's highest court was stepping into the crisis
pitting the president against his prime minister in a power
struggle over new elections.


The constitutional court is to deliberate Yushchenko's decision
two weeks ago to dissolve parliament, which Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych claims is illegal.


Yushchenko said there was no military presence in Kiev, and he
addressed himself "to those who are trying to bring in people
from the regions," asking them not to do so.


Barroso said that he was encouraged to hear Yushchenko rule out a
military solution to the crisis.


"There is a serious political crisis, let's face the facts," he
told a joint press conference with the Ukrainian leader.


"President Yushchenko explicitly informed me that all the efforts
now are clearly at the political level," he said.


"We hope that this political crisis is solved according to the
rules of democracy," he added.
