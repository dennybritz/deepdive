The South Korean port city of Incheon was Tuesday selected to
host the 2014 Asian Games, fending off a challenge from New Delhi
to hold the lucrative multi- sport event.


It will be the third time South Korea has played host, following
Seoul in 1986 and Busan in 2002. Seoul also held the Olympics in
1988.


The New Delhi delegation was devastated, insisting it was the
frontrunner and had a right to win after being overlooked since
it was last selected in 1982.


The vote swung in Incheon's favour after frantic last-minute
lobbying by both sides of the 45 Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
nations making up the body that controls sport in the region.
