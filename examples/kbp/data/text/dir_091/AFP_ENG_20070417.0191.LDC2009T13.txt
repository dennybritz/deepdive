The leader of a Sunni Arab insurgent group in Iraq said in an
Internet audio message posted on Tuesday that his organisation
has started to manufacture its own rockets.


The voice purported to be of Islamic State in Iraq chief Abu Omar
al-Baghdadi, whose group is controlled by Al-Qaeda's branch in
the country, said the rockets were called Al-Quds 1, after the
Arabic name for Jerusalem.


They have "entered the military manufacturing stage with a high
level of range and accuracy", according to the message on an
Islamist website whose authenticity could not be verified.
