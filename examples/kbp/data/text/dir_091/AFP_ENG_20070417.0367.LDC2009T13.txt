The Finnish parliament on Tuesday elected Centre Party leader
Matti Vanhanen as prime minister, a post he has held since 2003,
after his party won legislative elections last month.


Vanhanen garnered the support of 121 of 200 members of
parliament.


On Sunday, the Centre Party announced it had reached an agreement
to form a centre-right government with the conservatives, the
Greens and the Swedish People's Party, which together hold 125 of
the 200 seats in parliament.


Seventy opposition members -- from the Social Democrats,
Christian Democrats, far-left Left Alliance and far-right True
Finns -- voted against Vanhanen.


The new government is expected to be formally appointed by
President Tarja Halonen on Thursday.


The Centre Party won the March 18 elections with a one-seat
advantage over the conservative National Coalition Party, which
knocked the Social Democrats out of the ruling coalition and into
opposition for the first time since 1991.


The conservatives and the Centre Party will each hold eight
portfolios in the new cabinet.
