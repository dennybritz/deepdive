Andy Murray on Tuesday withdrew before his opening match at the
Monte Carlo Masters after suffering a back injury in doubles a
day earlier.


Murray and his elder brother Jamie had to retire in Monday
doubles as the world number ten from Scotland injured a back
muscle and could not go on after his side lost the first set in a
tiebreaker against Poles Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin
Matkowski.


Murray was to have opened in the second round after a singles bye
against experienced Frenchman Marc Giguel.


"This is an important time of the year for me because I didn't
play so well on the clay last year and I wanted to start off well
this year," said the eighth seed.


"I've been playing way better in practice than I was on the clay
last year, so I'm a little bit disappointed in that.


The muscular injury was the third for the Scot in a month after
falling over at Indian Wells and injuring his hip, then tweaking
his groin muscle in Miami a fortnight ago.


Murray recovered from the second problem to play one rubber in
Britain's Davis Cup win the Netherlands.


"I'm going to go back home today and have a scan. I'll know
exactly what the problem is and how bad the I inflammation is and
how long it's going to take to go away."
