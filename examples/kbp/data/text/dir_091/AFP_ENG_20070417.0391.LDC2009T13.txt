US Defence Secretary Robert Gates expressed his condolences on
Tuesday for the victims of the shooting at Virginia Tech
university, while on a Mideast tour.


Gates extended his "personal condolences to the faculty, students
and staff" of Virginia Tech at a press conference in Amman,
saying he understood the horror of Monday's shooting in which 33
people died because of his own history.


Before replacing Donald Rumsfeld as defence secretary, Gates was
president of Texas A&M University, where 12 students were
killed when the giant bonfire they were building collapsed on
them in 1999.


"As a recent president of a university that only seven-and-a-half
years ago had its own tragedy when 12 students were killed when
the bonfire collapsed at Texas A&M, perhaps more than most I
can understand the horror and the emotions at Virginia Tech,"
said Gates.


A gunman -- identified Tuesday as a Korean student -- killed 32
people at Virginia Tech on Monday before turning his weapon on
himself in the deadliest shooting rampage in modern US history.


Gates was the interim dean at Texas A&M's George Bush School
of Government and Public Service from 1999 to 2001. He became the
university president in 2002.
