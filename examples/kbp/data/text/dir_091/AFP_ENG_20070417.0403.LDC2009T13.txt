India on Tuesday called the campus shooting spree in the United
States a "terrible tragedy" and mourned the death of an Indian
professor who was among the 33 people who died.


"It's a terrible tragedy that has happened," India's junior
foreign minister Anand Sharma said in New Delhi.


Sharma confirmed that G.V. Loganathan, a 51-year-old professor
who was teaching civil and environmental engineering at Virginia
Tech University, died when the shooting broke out on the campus.


"The moment this news broke out and also about an Indian victim
-- the Indian professor -- our embassy acted very promptly and
that is why a senior official (diplomat) has been sent," he said.


"All assistance will be given by the Indian embassy in Washington
and we grieve the death of one of our Indian professors there,"
Sharma told reporters.


The slain academic's brother, G.V. Palanivel, said Loganathan's
family had been living in the United States for several decades.
He leaves a wife and two children.


"He devoted his life to the teaching community. It's very said
that he has to lose this life," Palanivel told the private NDTV
network from the southern state of Tamil Nadu.


An Indian student, Minal Panchal, has been missing since the
bloody attack on Monday and is feared dead, the Press Trust of
India also reported.


Police identified Cho Seung-Hui, a legal US resident, as the
shooter at Virginia Tech University and said he may have acted
alone in killing 32 people before committing suicide on Monday.
