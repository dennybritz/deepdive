Hundreds of Congolese students in the eastern town of Goma held a
march Tuesday to protest an attack blamed on Hutu rebels that
killed one of their number.


An AFP correspondent in Goma saw police fire in the air and use
tear gas to break up Tuesday's demonstration, which according to
a police estimate involved about 800 students.


In Monday's attack, gunmen from the mainly Hutu Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) opened fire on a minibus
after it failed to stop at their command, Colonel Delphin Dahimbi
told AFP, adding that one student had been killed in the attack.


The minibus eventually reached its destination, the regional
capital Goma in the eastern province of Nord Kivu.


The attack happened at the same place where FDLR rebels killed
seven Congolese soldiers in an ambush last Friday.


Both local militia and Rwandan Hutu rebels are hostile to the
recent deployment of Congolese troops in the area.


These forces include soldiers recently reintegrated from a rebel
force led by renegade Congolese Tutsi general Laurent Nkunda.


Ethnic tensions have long been at the heart of the violence in
the region.


For the past 12 years, the FDLR have been based in the east of
the Democratic Republic of Congo, bordering Rwanda and Uganda,
and are seen as a major source of instability in the Great Lakes
region.


Many members are suspected of having taken part in the 1994
genocide in neighbouring Rwanda in which 800,000 Tutsis and
moderates of the majority Hutu group population were killed,
according to the United Nations figures.
