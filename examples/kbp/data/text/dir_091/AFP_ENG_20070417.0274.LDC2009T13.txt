Hundreds of Pakistani farmers chanted "Death to the World Trade
Organisation" as a group of agricultural exporting nations opened
a meeting here on cuts in government subsidies.


About 300 people marched for a kilometre (less than a mile) under
the scorching sun here to voice their condemnation of moves by
the 19-member Cairns Group to slash subsidies on farm products.


The protesters carried placards reading "WTO is a murderer of
farmers" and "Save the Poor".


Earlier, representatives of Pakistan's farming community held a
seminar where they criticised what they called the "anti-poor
agenda of the World Trade Organisation dominated by the rich
countries."


With a mainly agriculture-based economy, Pakistan heavily
subsidises farm outputs through state procurement of wheat and
provision of water, fertilisers and seeds at reduced prices.


The meeting of the Cairns Group comes a week after the so-called
Group of Six major trading powers said in New Delhi they would
push for a new global free- trade treaty by the end of this year.


The Cairns Group comprises Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay, the Philippines, Peru,
South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay.


Pakistan joined in December 2005.


The group has lobbied to eliminate farm subsidies and import
tariffs in the developed world since its formation in 1986 in the
Australian city of Cairns.
