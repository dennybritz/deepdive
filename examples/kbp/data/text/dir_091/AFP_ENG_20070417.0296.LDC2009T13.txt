Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels gunned down four people in Sri
Lanka's north and eastern regions as violence continued during
traditional New Year celebrations, the military said Tuesday.


Two men were shot dead early Tuesday in Batticaloa district, 300
kilometres (190 miles) east of Colombo, the military said, adding
that investigations were underway.


Elsewhere, unidentified gunmen shot dead a 31-year-old local aid
worker attached to a government agency in the eastern district of
Ampara on Tuesday, police said.


In the northeastern district of Vavuniya, 260 kilometres (160
miles) north of here, suspected Tiger rebels gunned down a man
inside his home late Monday, the defence ministry said.


Six people were gunned down in the same district at the weekend.


The military blamed the Tamil Tigers for the four deaths, but the
rebels denied involvement.


Government forces are trying to eject the rebels from large
swathes of jungle in the east. The rebels also run a mini-state
in the north of the island.


The majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamil communities are
currently marking their common New Year festivities, which end
Thursday.


More than 4,000 people were killed between December 2005 and the
first week of March 2007 across the island, including 675
civilians and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence
ministry figures.


The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
