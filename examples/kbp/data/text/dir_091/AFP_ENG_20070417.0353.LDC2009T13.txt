The United Nations human rights chief will visit several ex-
Soviet states in central Asia over the next two weeks in a bid to
deepen human rights activities in the region, her office said on
Tuesday.


UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour will visit
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan between April
24 and May 5, her office said in a statement.


"The visit aims at increasing the engagement of the Office in the
region, and to discuss future cooperation and human rights issues
of mutual concern," the statement said.


However, she will not visit Uzbekistan despite persistent
criticism of its human rights record by activists.


Rights groups said that hundreds of people were shot dead in the
country's Andijan province in 2005, although Uzbek authorities
said that 187 people were killed and blamed Islamist insurgents
for the unrest.


The 47-member UN Human Rights Council, a separate body, last
month decided to drop its examination of violations in
Uzbekistan, against the opposition of Western states such as
France, diplomatic sources in Geneva said.
