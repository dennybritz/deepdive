US housing starts increased 0.8 percent in March, the Commerce
Department said Tuesday in a report defying many forecasts for
more declines in the troubled property market.


The report showed starts increased to an annualized pace of 1.518
million units, against expectations for a drop to a pace of 1.5
million.


The agency revised down its estimate for February to show a 7.6
percent rise from an initial report of a nine percent jump.


But even with the increases in the past two months, housing
starts are down 23 percent from a year earlier.


The latest report showed building permits, a sign of future
construction, rose 0.8 percent to a pace of 1.544 million units.
That remains down 25.9 percent from a year ago.


New home construction fell sharply last year as the market was
buffeted by rising interest rates and slowing demand following
years of spectacular growth which unleashed a speculative frenzy
in some cities.
