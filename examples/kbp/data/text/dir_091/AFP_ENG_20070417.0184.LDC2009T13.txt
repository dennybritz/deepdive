The Israeli army on Tuesday killed a Palestinian militant near
the West Bank city of Jenin, security sources said.


Ashraf Hanaisha, 22, was a member of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a
militant group loosely affiliated with president Mahmud Abbas's
Fatah party, they said.


An army spokesman said soldiers had fired on an armed man.
"During a routine operation south of Jenin, the troops saw a man
pull a pistol and opened fire on him," he said.


Hanaisha's death brought to 5,660 the number of people killed
since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000,
the vast majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP
count.
