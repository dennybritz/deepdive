EU regulators are set to fine brewers including giants Heineken
and InBev on Wednesday for participating in an illegal cartel in
The Netherlands, informed sources said on Tuesday.


The European Commission, the European Union's competition
watchdog, declined to comment on the matter when questioned by
AFP.


The Commission's trustbusters launched a probe at the beginning
of the decade into unfair practices by some European brewers,
leading in September 2005 to formal charges being lodged.


According to a source close to the matter, Heineken, Interbrew --
which has since become InBev -- Royal Grolsch and Bavaria shared
sensitive information about prices and carved up the market among
themselves between 1994 and 1999, keeping prices artificially
high.


Unconvinced by the companies' defence, the Commission is set to
fine the them sums that will be determined on Wednesday.


Heineken confirmed that it was expecting to be fined for its
role.


"We've expected a decision for some time but now we expect a
decision tomorrow (Wednesday) and we expect a fine," spokeswoman
Veronique Schyns told AFP.


Shares in Heineken were down 1.07 percent at 38.61 euros, Grolsch
was down 1.58 percent at 31.64 euros in Amsterdam while InBev
stock was down 0.40 percent at 56.75 euros. Bavaria is a
privately-held company.


EU regulators' probe into European brewers has also led to fines
against brewers for running cartels in Luxembourg and Belgium.
