The mayor of Nagasaki was shot and wounded Tuesday as he
campaigned for re- election, officials said.


Police said Iccho Ito was shot in the back and it was not clear
how serious his condition was, although news reports said the
mayor was not showing any signs of movement.


Ito was shot in front of his election office, public broadcaster
NHK said.


An ambulance arrived within minutes and medics attended to the
mayor, who was lying on the ground after the attack, it said.


Television footage showed police tackling a suspect, who was
arrested on the spot and taken into custody. NHK said the suspect
refused to identify himself to police.


Gun violence is rare in Japan, which strictly controls arms
possession.


But Nagasaki has seen violence against politicians before. In
January 1990, a member of an extreme right-wing group shot and
wounded then mayor Hitoshi Motoshima for saying he believed late
emperor Hirohito bore responsibility for World War II.


Ito is running for another term as mayor of the southern Japanese
city.


Nagasaki is best known as the site of the world's second last
atomic attack, which killed more than 70,000 people on August 9,
1945.
