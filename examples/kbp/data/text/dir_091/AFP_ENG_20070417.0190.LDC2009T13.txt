Four brothers were hanged Tuesday at a prison in central Pakistan
for slaughtering 13 members of their own family over a land
dispute, officials said.


The four were executed in the central city of Multan after
President Pervez Musharraf rejected their plea for clemency, jail
superintendent Mubashar Malik said, adding the bodies were handed
over to their mother.


The brothers, named as Khuda Bakhsh, Muhammad Asghar, Muhammad
Akram and Muhammad Iqbal, were convicted of the murderous rampage
in 1999 after their uncle refused to sell a plot of land, police
said.


Their 13 victims included women and a three-month-old baby,
police said.


Their father was arrested with them, but died in prison during
the trial.


Pakistan's Supreme Court and Lahore High Court had both turned
down appeals by the four brothers.


The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan urged the government in
January to abolish capital punishment, with more than 7,400
prisoners currently on death row in Pakistani jails.


Rape, murder and terrorism are all punishable by death in
Pakistan.
