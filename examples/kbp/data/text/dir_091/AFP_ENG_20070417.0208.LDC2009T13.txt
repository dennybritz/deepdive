Management and workers' representatives at General Motors met in
Brussels on Tuesday for new talks about possible cost cutting
measures at the US car giant's European subsidiaries.


GM Europe spokesman Andreas Kroemer said that the talks focused
on "production allocation of the next generation" of compact cars
like Opel Astra and Opel Zafira.


"Talks are going on and it is premature to say if there will be
any decision today," he added.


GM opened talks in March on a new cost-cutting programme at its
European marques Saab, Vauxhall and Opel, with overcapacity
reportedly set to rise sharply in the coming years.


German magazine Capital reported last week that GM could slash
thousands more jobs at its German unit Opel, on top of drastic
restructuring measures three years ago.
