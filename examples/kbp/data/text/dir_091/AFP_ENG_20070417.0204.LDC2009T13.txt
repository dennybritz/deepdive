Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko pledged Tuesday to find a
democratic solution to his country's political crisis and ruled
out the use of force.


"We are determined to find a democratic resolution to the
parliamentary crisis in Ukraine," he told reporters in Brussels,
after talks with European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso.


"We've never been saying and never (been) crudely speaking about
any option with using force to resolve the situation," he said.


As he spoke, Ukraine's highest court was stepping into the crisis
pitting the president against his prime minister in a power
struggle over new elections.


The constitutional court was deliberating Yushchenko's decision
of two weeks ago to dissolve parliament, which Prime Minister
Viktor Yanukovych claims is illegal.
