The gunman who killed at least 30 people in a US university was a
23-year-old South Korean student identified as Cho Seung-Hui,
police confirmed Tuesday.


"He was a 23-year-old South Korean here in the US as a resident
alien," Virginia Tech University campus police chief Wendell
Flinchum said in a news conference.


Cho was an undergraduate student in his senior year majoring in
English, Flinchum said. He lived on campus at Harper Hall and his
residence was established in Centreville, Virginia outside
Washington.


Police suspect Cho was the shooter in two Virginia Tech
buildings, killing 32 people before turning the gun on himself in
the deadliest school shooting in US history.
