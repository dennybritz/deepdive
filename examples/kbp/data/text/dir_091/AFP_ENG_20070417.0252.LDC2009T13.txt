The gunman in a massacre that killed 32 people on a Virginia
campus was a student of Asian origin and may have acted with a
second suspect, the university's president said Tuesday.


"It appears that the second shooter was a resident in our
dormitory ... it appears he was an on-campus resident," Virginia
Tech University Charles Steger said in an interview on ABC
television.


Asked if he meant that there were two people involved in the
killings, he said: "That's what we're trying to confirm ... The
possibility exists."


He confirmed that the gunman who shot himself after the shooting
rampage was an Asian male.


Two bouts of shootings rocked the university in the town of
Blacksburg early Monday morning. Two people were shot dead in a
dormitory before a shooter rampaged through a classroom building
two hours later, killing a further 30 and turning the gun on
himself.


Student Erin Sheehan, who survived after the gunman barged into
her German class and fired repeatedly, told CNN the attacker was
of Asian appearance, wearing a short-sleeved tan shirt and black
ammunition vest.


The Chicago Sun Times daily cited an unnamed official source as
saying that authorities were investigating whether he was a
Chinese man who came to the United States in August 2006 on a
student visa issued in Shanghai.


Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao in Beijing said
China could not confirm the report.


Steger could not confirm whether the student was Chinese.
