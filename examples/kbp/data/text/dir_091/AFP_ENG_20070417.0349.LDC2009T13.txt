Mobile phones, wallets, keys: drop them in a British city centre
and more often than not, someone will run off with them, said a
study out Tuesday which showed Britons failing the honesty test.


Just 38 percent of such items deliberately left in the street on
busy shopping days were returned to their owners, despite being
clearly marked with their contact details.


The items were left in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow,
London and Manchester in the honesty test.


Just 16 percent of the items were returned in Birmingham,
Britain's second city, and 24 percent in London compared with 64
percent in Bristol.


Every mobile phone left in Cardiff was returned, compared to none
in Birmingham.


"This experiment revealed some interesting behavioural patterns,"
said psychologist Sue Keane, who led the survey for credit card
protection firm Affinion International.


"For example, a mobile phone was more likely to be returned than
a wallet or keys because we can identify better with the loss.


"Passers-by often picked up the dropped item and immediately
showed it to a stranger. It was as if they wanted to absolve
their worries by sharing the find with someone else and
demonstrate that they are not interested in stealing the item --
though ultimately many were not returned."


Affinion International managing director David Palmer warned:
"The experiment was a real eye-opener and it goes to show that
you just can't rely on people's honesty, and should take personal
responsibility for possessions."
