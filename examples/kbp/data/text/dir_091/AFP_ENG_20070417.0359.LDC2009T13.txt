The same gun was used in two shootings at Virginia Tech
University, suggesting only one gunman killed 32 people and
himself, Colonel Steve Flaherty, Superintendent of Virginia State
Police, said Tuesday.


"The ballistics test says that one of the weapons used in Norris
Hall was also used in the (first) shooting," he said.


"It certainly is reasonable for us to assume that Cho (Seung-Hui)
was the shooter in both places but we don't have the evidence to
take us there at this particular point in time," he said.
