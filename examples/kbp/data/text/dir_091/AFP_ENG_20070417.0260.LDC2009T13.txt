US Chip giant Intel's upcoming Penryn processors will boost
computer speed by 40 percent for gaming compared to existing top-
line chips, the company said Tuesday.


The chips, expected to hit the market in the second half of 2007,
would also increase performance by an estimated 45 percent for
bandwidth-intensive applications, Patrick Gelsinger, the
company's general manager for digital enterprise, said at the
Intel Developer's Forum in Beijing.


Gelsinger added the chip would allow performance increases of
about 15 percent for imaging-related applications, 25 percent for
3-D rendering, and more than 40 percent for video encoding.


Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, held its
developer's forum in China just a month after announcing plans
for a $2.5 billion chip plant in the northeast China city of
Dalian.


The new plant reflects a new focus by the company on China which
is expected to help the country evolve into a more high-tech
manufacturing centre.
