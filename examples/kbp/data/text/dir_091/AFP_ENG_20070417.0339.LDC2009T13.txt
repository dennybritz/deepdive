British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday praised Australia's
decision to double its military contingent backing a NATO-led
force in Afghanistan, saying it was typical of the country's
"spirit".


Blair said NATO still needs other countries to contribute more in
Afghanistan, where British troops are among those suffering a
growing death toll battling a spring offensive by Taliban
insurgents.


Australia announced last week that it would nearly double its
military force in Afghanistan to 1,000 troops, warning that the
war against a resurgent Taliban would not be won without extra
effort.


"I'd like to thank Australia and the Australian people for their
commitment in Afghanistan which is tremendous and absolutely
typical of Australia, the Australian spirit, and the Australian
people," said Blair.


"I think Australia understands how important it is for the fight
against terorrism worldwide. There are NATO countries stepping up
to the mark but... we need more to happen," he added at his
monthly press conference.


Another British soldier was killed last week in southern
Afghanistan, the 53rd death since the country's hardline former
rulers, the Taliban, were ousted from power in late 2001.
