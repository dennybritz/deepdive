Renowned Egyptian-British surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub, dubbed the
"King of Hearts" at home has performed open-heart surgery on a
terror suspect implicated in a deadly attack in Cairo last year,
security sources said Tuesday.


Reda Sayed Ahmed, 26, who suffers from an abscess in the aorta
and a valve malfunction, is accused of being involved in an
attack on Cairo's Al-Azhar district on April 7, 2005 in which two
French and one American tourist were killed.


He underwent a first operation in a private hospital which proved
unsuccessful and was transferred to the Kasr al-Einy teaching
hospital -- where Yacoub regularly performs -- for emergency
surgery.


The operation, which will cost 26,000 Egyptian pounds (4,500
dollars) will be paid for by the state, the source told AFP.


"The decision to treat the accused on state funds was taken by
Interior Minister Habib al-Adli, in order to provide medical
assistance to the detained, conforming with international
standards of human rights," the source said.


Human Rights organisations have regularly criticised the
inadequate medical care given to Egyptian prisoners.


Yacoub, who was born in 1935 to a Coptic-Orthodox Egyptian
family, left to England in 1962.


A pioneer in his field, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in
1992.
