The Cleveland Indians inked reliable righthander Jake Westbrook
to a three-year contract extension on Friday in a deal worth a
reported 33 million dollars.


Westbrook, 29, would have been eligible for free agency at the
end of this season and easily would have been one of the top
available starting pitchers on the open market.


But the Indians clearly had no intention of losing Westbrook, one
of just four American League pitchers to post at least 14 wins in
each of the last three seasons.


Financial terms were not disclosed, but the Cleveland Plain
Dealer reported on its website that the contract was worth 33
million dollars.


"This contract further demonstrates ownership's unwavering
commitment to building and sustaining a championship team in
Cleveland," Indians general manager Mark Shapiro said. "Jake's
high level of character, professionalism and dedication to
preparation factored heavily in the decision-making process for
the club, and ultimately Jake's desire to remain a Cleveland
Indian made the agreement possible."


A 2004 All-Star, Westbrook has gotten off to a slow start this
season, going 0-1 with a 7.36 ERA in his first two starts.


He owns a career record of 56-54 with a 4.39 ERA in parts of
eight campaigns with Cleveland and the New York Yankees.
