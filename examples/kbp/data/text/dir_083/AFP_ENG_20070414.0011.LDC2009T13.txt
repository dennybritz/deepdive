Another three American soldiers have been killed in attacks south
of Baghdad, the US military said Saturday.


Two soldiers and two Iraqi interpretors died when a patrol base
was ambushed by insurgents on Friday. Another seven US troops
were wounded.


Combat helicopters and a quick reaction force were scrambled to
the scene to repel the attack, the military said in a statement.


A roadside bomb killed a third US soldier and left another
wounded south of Baghdad while their unit was patrolling the
area.


The latest fatalities brought the US military's losses in Iraq to
39 in this month alone and to 3,293 since the March 2003
invasion, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
