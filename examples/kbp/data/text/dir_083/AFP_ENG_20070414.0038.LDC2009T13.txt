A car bomb exploded causing casualties at a bus station near the
Imam Hussein shrine in Iraq's Shiite holy city of Karbala on
Saturday, a security source said.


The blast ripped through a shopping area next to the bus station
at around 9:15 am (0515 GMT), said the official on condition of
anonymity.


The blast, about 200 metres (yards) from the revered Imam Hussein
shrine, caused casualties, said the official, adding that no
further information was immediately available.
