A special US envoy, just back from North Korea, said he believed
Pyongyang will eventually shut down its nuclear reactor, but will
likely delay the move by several days.


"I do believe they are committed at least to Phase 1 and Phase 2
of the six- party agreement, which is to start a denuclearization
of their weapons," New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said of
North Koreans.


"Probably they won't make the deadline, but a few days after, I
believe, they will meet their obligations," he told National
Public Radio on Friday.


The deadline for North Korea to shut down its Yongbyon atomic
reactor and invite UN inspectors arrived Saturday, as the
communist state promised to honor a commitment to scrap its
nuclear program.


Richardson, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, led a
US delegation to Pyongyang with the blessing of the White House
this past week.


In his interview, he also urged continued direct contacts between
the United States and North Korea.


"What they respond to is dealing with them directly and I believe
the Bush administration has been doing that," Richardson said.
