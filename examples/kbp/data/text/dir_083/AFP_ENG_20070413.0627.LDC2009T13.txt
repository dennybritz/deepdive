A public Canadian television network reported late Friday that it
had obtained a video of two French nationals taken hostage in
Afghanistan, in which they say they fear for their lives.


The French aid workers, from the non-governmental organisation
Terre d'Enfance (A World for Our Children), went missing on April
3 in the southwestern province of Nimroz.


The Islamist Taliban militia say they are holding the pair, a man
and a woman, along with three of their Afghan colleagues.
