Human error was at the root of the loss in November of the Mars
Global Surveyor that had orbited the red planet for nine years,
NASA said Friday.


An error in programming of the onboard computer memory in June
2006 led to a battery failure in the spacecraft, according to a
preliminary investigation by an internal NASA review board.


"The loss of the spacecraft was the result of a series of events
linked to a computer error made five months before the likely
battery failure," said board chairwoman Dolly Perkins, an
official at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Maryland.


The National Aeronautics and Space Administration lost contact
with the orbiter on November 2 after the spacecraft was ordered
to perform a routine adjustment of its solar panels, NASA said.


The batteries died after one of them overheated when the Surveyor
moved to an angle exposing it to direct sunlight, it said.


The Surveyor team followed existing procedures that turned out to
be insufficient to catch the errors, NASA said


The Mars Global Surveyor was launched November 7, 1996, reaching
the planet's orbit on September 11, 1997.


It started taking pictures of Mars in April 1999, eventually
beaming 240,000 images back to Earth that helped improve
understanding of the red planet.


The mission was supposed to last two years, but the orbiter
survived for nine.
