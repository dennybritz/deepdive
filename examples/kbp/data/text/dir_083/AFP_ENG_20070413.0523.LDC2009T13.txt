Two men were sentenced to 23 years in prison on Friday by a
French court for stoning a young woman to death in 2004.


The body of 23-year-old Ghofrane Haddaoui was discovered on a
patch of wasteland in the north of the Mediterranean city of
Marseille in October 2004, her skull battered in by rocks.


"Justice is done. I'm smiling," said Haddaoui's mother, Monia
Haddaoui, adding that she had "decided to live" because of the
verdict.


An autopsy revealed that Haddaoui had received more than 30 blows
to the head, powerful enough to rip out several of her teeth.


The two accused, now 19 and 20, were minors at the time of the
crime. A third, 19, was acquitted on Friday of failing to report
a crime.


One of the murderers initially confessed to the crime, saying
Haddaoui had refused his advances, before retracting his
statement to police. Each later accused the other of
responsibility.


The closed-door trial, at a court for minors, provided little
explanation for the motive of the murder.


One of the suspects acknowledged his participation in the killing
during the trial, though he was unable to explain it, his lawyer
said. The other maintained his innocence.
