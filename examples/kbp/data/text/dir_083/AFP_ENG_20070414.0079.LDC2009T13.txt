Cheetahs prop Jannie du Plessis was Saturday cleared of biting a
Wellington Hurricanes player in their Super 14 match when the
judicial panel found there was insufficient proof.


"There was a clear conflict in the evidence," SANZAR (South
Africa, New Zealand, Australia) judicial officer Bruce Squire
said in a statement.


Du Plessis was accused of biting Hurricanes fullback Cory Jane in
Friday night's match won by the Wellington side 37-15.


Jane was clear he had been bitten by du Plessis but du Plessis
was equally adamant he was not guilty, and Squire said the video
evidence did not help in resolving the issue.


The Hurricanes team doctor was equivocal, saying the injury to
Jane was consistent with a bite and equally consistent with an
injury caused by contact between mouth and arm that did not
involve a bite.


The doctor also could not exclude the possibility the injury was
caused by a nail or a pinch.
