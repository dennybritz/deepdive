Two suicide bombers were killed in an explosion Saturday in the
Moroccan city of Casablanca, security forces said.


Saturday's blast comes after three suicide bombers blew
themselves up on Tuesday in Casablanca.


The three were wanted in connection with a March 11 bombing at a
Casablanca Internet cafe staged by another suspected militant.
