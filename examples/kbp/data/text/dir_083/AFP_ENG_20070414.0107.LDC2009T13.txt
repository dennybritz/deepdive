Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah condemned as a "criminal act" the
deadly Al-Qaeda attacks last Wednesday in Algeria which killed 33
people, the state news agency SPA said.


"We condemn this criminal act...and hope Algeria and its people
are protected from all who hate it," SPA quoted the king saying
in a telegram sent to the Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika.


The two suicide bomb attacks in Algiers also wounded more than
220 people.


The bombings were claimed by Al-Qaeda's branch in North Africa,
formerly known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat
(GSPC), which published photographs of what it said were the
three bombers on the Internet.


Saudi Arabia has over recent years come under attack from Al-
Qaeda inspired militants who aim to topple the ruling pro-US
monarchy and drive foreigners from the birthplace of Islam.
