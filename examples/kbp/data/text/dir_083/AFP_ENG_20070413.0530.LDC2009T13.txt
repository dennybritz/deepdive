ABN Amro which is in exclusive talks with Britain's Barclays Bank
about a takeover deal on Friday confirmed press reports that Bank
of Scotland together with Fortis and Banco Santander also
approached the Dutch bank about a possible acquisition.


"ABN AMRO confirms that it has received a letter today from Royal
Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander and Fortis in which they invite
ABN AMRO to start exploratory talks," the bank said in a press
release.


ABN Amro said it would consider the letter "carefully" but
stressed it was in exclusive talks with Barclays.


In a separate press release Dutch-Belgian bank and insurance
company Fortis said Friday it has submitted a letter to ABN Amro
Thursday together with the other banks "to express the banks'
interest in putting forward a proposal for the acquisition of ABN
Amro and their preference to work with ABN AMRO to make an offer
to ABN Amro shareholders".


"The banks hope to take discussions forward with the supervisory
and managing boards of ABN Amro, although there can be no
certainty that these discussions will lead to a transaction or
the form it might take," Fortis added.


Barclays and ABN Amro have been in exclusive takeover talks for
three weeks.
