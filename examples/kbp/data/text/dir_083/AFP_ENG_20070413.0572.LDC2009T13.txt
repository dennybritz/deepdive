The United States shied away from a call by NATO to send
thousands more of its stretched military personnel to train
Afghanistan's police and army, in comments released Friday.


"Quite frankly, we're having trouble, and probably two thirds of
those (forces requested) are for the police," US Defense
Secretary Robert Gates said after a NATO meeting in Canada, in
comments released by the Defense Department.


"So one of the things we talked about (at the meeting) was
approaching other Europeans about filling some of those
positions, because it's training jobs and they have some real
expertise in that area."


Ministers and envoys from eight NATO allies meeting in Quebec on
Thursday agreed to bolster cooperation in Afghanistan ahead of an
expected spring offensive by resurgent fighters loyal to the
ousted Taliban regime.


The meeting did not discuss sending more forces to join the
37,000-strong NATO- led International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF), but Gates later revealed that commanders asked the US to
fill "about 3,400 training positions."


The US military is already looking stretched, having started a
"surge" of troops to boost its presence in Iraq. Gates said
Wednesday that army soldiers' tours of duty in Iraq and
Afghanistan would be extended from 12 to 15 months.


ISAF is trying to stabilize the war-torn country which has seen
an upsurge in attacks by the Taliban, ousted by a US-led invasion
in 2001.
