A car bomb killed at least 40 people in a shopping area near the
Imam Hussein shrine in Iraq's Shiite holy city of Karbala on
Saturday, a medical source said.


The medic from the local hospital said many of the victims were
women and children, adding that the bomb went off at a bus
station which is surrounded by many shops.


A security official earlier said that the blast ripped through
the shopping area at around 9:15 am (0515 GMT).


The bomb went off about 200 metres (yards) from the revered Imam
Hussein shrine.
