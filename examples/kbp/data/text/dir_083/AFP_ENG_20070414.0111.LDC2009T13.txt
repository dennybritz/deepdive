The United States embassy on Saturday appealed for information on
a Peace Corps volunteer who has gone missing in the northern
Philippines.


Julia Campbell, 40, was last seen in Banauae town in the
mountainous northern Philippine province of Ifugao on April 8, an
embassy statement said.


She "intended to hike in a hilly area" east of the town and was
unaccompanied.


She had been working in the Philippines since March 2005 as a
teacher in Legazpi City, south of Manila.


Communist guerrillas kidnapped a US Peace Corps volunteer in the
central Philippines in 1990, but freed him shortly afterwards.


The rebels are known to be present in Ifugao province, but have
not kidnapped foreigners for years.


There are 137 Peace Corps volunteers serving in the Philippines.
