Finance chiefs from the seven leading economies threw their
weight Friday behind an ongoing reform drive aimed at preserving
the "relevance and legitimacy" of the International Monetary
Fund.


"We agree to push forward the ambitious package of bold and
fundamental reforms in order to retain the IMF's relevance and
legitimacy," Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank
heads said in a statement after talks here.


They said the overhaul, the first stage of which was approved by
the IMF at a meeting in Singapore last September, should ensure
that dynamic emerging market economies are better represented in
the 185-member body.


The Fund last September agreed to increase the voting power in
the IMF of China, South Korea, Turkey and Mexico as a first step.


The G7 officials, representing Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States, at their meeting Friday in
addition contended "the voice of low income countries should be
enhanced" as well.


They in addition said that a "necessary element of IMF reform" is
strengthened surveillance over exchange rates.


The reference to exchange rate surveillance appeared to reflect
G7 concern about what they see as weak currencies in China and
Japan, which they maintain give Chinese and Japanese exports an
unfair advantage on world markets.
