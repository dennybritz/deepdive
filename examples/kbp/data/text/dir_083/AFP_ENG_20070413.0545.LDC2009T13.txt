The Texas Rangers activated Eric Gagne from the 15-day disabled
list on Friday and hope to unveil the injury-prone closer in
their series against the Seattle Mariners.


The 31-year-old Canadian has been ravaged by a litany of injuries
over the past two years and was sidelined for the first two weeks
of the Major League Baseball season while recovering from elbow
surgery.


Despite his lengthy history of injuries, the Rangers took a
chance on Gagne in the offseason, signing the 31-year-old to a
one-year deal reportedly worth six million dollars in incentives.


Gagne made three appearances - including two starts - for Class
AA Frisco, going 0-1 with a 3.38 ERA.


The 2003 National League Cy Young Award winner, Gagne has a
record of 25-21 with a 3.27 ERA in 298 career games - all but 48
in relief - with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
