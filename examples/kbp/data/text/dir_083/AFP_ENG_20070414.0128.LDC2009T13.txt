Egyptian security forces have arrested a Saudi man trying to get
through barbed wire on the Egypt-Israel border east of Sinai, an
Egyptian official said on Saturday.


"Despite the fact he was on foot, he told police he was heading
for the (Egyptian) sea resort of Nuweiba -- more than 100
kilometres (60 miles) from the place where he was arrested," the
security official said, on condition of anonymity.


"Egyptian police have confirmed that it is forbidden for
foreigners to be in this region and access to these border points
is extremely difficult, apart from the bedouins who live there,"
he added.


The detainee, arrested on Friday night as he was trying to cross
the wire in the direction of Israel, was named as Abdel-Wadad
Abdel-Alim al-Doussari, aged 32.


Egyptian authorities had alerted the Saudi embassy in Cairo while
they were questioning the man.
