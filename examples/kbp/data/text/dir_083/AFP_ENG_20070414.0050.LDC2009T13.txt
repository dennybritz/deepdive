Gunmen early Saturday killed six policemen in raids on two police
stations in Nigeria's oil capital Port Harcourt, police said.


The attacks came hours ahead of the start nationwide of state
governorship and assembly elections.


Residents and one election observer said gunmen attacked and
burned down the Mino Okoro and Elelenwo police stations.


"Six policemen were killed and some inmates were freed from the
two police stations", Rivers State police chief Felix Ogbaudu
told AFP.


An industry source said a further five policemen were wounded.


The attacks happened between 1:30 and 3:30 am (0030 GMT and 0230
GMT) and were carried out by some 16 gunmen who arrived in two
vehicles, the same source said.


Southern Nigeria's oil-producing region has been the theatre of
violence, ranging from gang warfare to kidnappings of oil
workers, for the past several years.


In a week's time Nigeria, which has a history of electoral
violence, will hold presidential elections, expected to mark the
country's first civilian-to- civilian handover since Independence
in 1960.
