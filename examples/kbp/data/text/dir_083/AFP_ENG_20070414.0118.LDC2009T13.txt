Thirty two people were killed and 30 injured on Saturday when a
bus carrying schoolchildren and a truck collided in central
Turkey, local authorities said.


The accident occurred at around 6:00 am in the province of
Aksaray, said governor Sebati Buyuran, quoted by the Anatolia
news agency.


"An exact count of the victims brings the number of dead to 32
and the  injured to 30," Buyuran said.


He said seven of the injured had been transferred to hospitals in
the nearby cities of Kayseri and Konya. The governor did not
indicate how many of the fatalities were children.


The bus was carrying children from a primary school in the
western city of Izmir on a trip to the tourist region of
Cappadocia, a spokesman for the governor told AFP.


"There are many children among the victims," the spokesman said,
adding that the exact number would not be known until autopsies
are performed.


The cause of the crash was not immediately known.


One of the two drivers of the bus said the vehicle was not
overloaded. He said he was asleep at the back of the bus at the
time of the accident.


The all-news television channel CNN-Turk said the other driver
was killed.


Five of the injured were in serious condition, including three
children, said a health official in Aksaray, Akin Sudemen.


CNN-Turk showed pictures of the overturned bus on the side of the
road, with baggage strewn around the site, and of relatives of
the children in tears at their school.
