China urged the parties involved in nuclear talks to show
patience with North Korea as it looked set to miss a crucial
deadline to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear power plant, US envoy
Christopher Hill said here Saturday.


"The Chinese believe we should show a little more patience on
this in the coming days," Hill told journalists.
