Gunmen early Saturday killed at least three policemen in raids on
two police stations in Nigeria's oil capital Port Harcourt,
sources said.


Residents and one election observer said that three policemen
were killed when gunmen attacked and burned down the Mino Okoro
and Elelenwo police stations.


An industrial source put the number of police killed at six and
said a further five were wounded.


The attacks happened between 1:30 and 3:30 am (0030 GMT and 0230
GMT) and were carried out by some 16 gunmen who arrived in two
vehicles, the same source said.
