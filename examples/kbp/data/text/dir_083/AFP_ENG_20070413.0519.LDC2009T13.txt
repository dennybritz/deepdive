US shares ended higher Friday as investor confidence gained
momentum ahead of the weekend despite lackluster earnings news
and lukewarm economic reports, traders said.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 59.17 points (0.47
percent) at 12,612.13 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite rebounded 11.62 points (0.47 percent) to
2,491.94 and the Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index
advanced 5.04 points (0.35 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,452.84.


Stocks had oscillated earlier in the day after the government
reported that US wholesale prices jumped a sharp 1.0 percent in
March, but an easing of inflation at the critical "core" level
appeared to soothe some analysts.


The inflation numbers showed that "core" prices, excluding
volatile food and energy costs which are seen by some economists
as a better indicator of future trends, were flat, despite
expectations for a 0.2 percent rise.
