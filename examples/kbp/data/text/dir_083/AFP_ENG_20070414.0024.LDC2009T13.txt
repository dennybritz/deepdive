Two-time National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player
Steve Nash scored 26 points with 14 assists Friday as Phoenix
defeated the struggling Los Angeles Lakers.


The Suns triumphed 93-85, handing Kobe Bryant's slumping Lakers
their sixth loss in their last seven games.


Raja Bell scored 18 points and Amare Stoudemire and fellow All-
Star Shawn Marion each had double-doubles for the Suns, who
improved to 60-19 and inched closer to clinching the second seed
in the Western Conference.


With only two games remaining this season, the Lakers at 40-40
are one-half game better than the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden
State Warriors for seventh place in the West.


After notching his ninth 50-point performance of the season
Thursday in a loss to the Clippers, Lakers superstar Bryant went
cold, netting just 17 points on 7-of-26 shooting, including
1-of-6 from 3-point range.


In the fourth quarter, Bryant nailed a floater, then fed Luke
Walton for an easy layup with 3:41 remaining as Los Angeles
closed within 82-79.


But Nash and Stoudemire responded with consecutive baskets to
rebuild a seven- point advantage one minute later and never
looked back thereafter.


Meanwhile, the Warriors continued their playoff push with a
125-108 victory over Sacramento.


Stephen Jackson scored 26 points and Baron Davis added 25 to lead
seven players in double figures as the Warriors remained tied
with the Clippers for the final playoff spot in the West. The
Clippers beat Portland 107-89 on Friday.
