Britain's Prince William and his longtime girlfriend, Kate
Middleton, have split up, the Sun newspaper reported Saturday.


The mass circulation daily quoted a close friend as saying the
pressure had become too much for them, particularly because the
24-year-old prince's military duties meant they were rarely
together and because of the enormous media interest in Kate,
living alone in London.


"As far as Kate is concerned, William simply hasn't paid her
enough attention," the friend said. "She is stuck in London while
he is living in an officer's mess in Dorset. Kate feels hugely
frustrated."


Clarence House, the office which handles the prince's affairs,
refused to confirm the split, saying "We don't comment on Prince
William's private life."


The couple had been going out for four years.


Prince William, who is second in line to the throne, met Kate
Middleton in 2001 at St. Andrew's University in Scotland where
they shared a flat with two other students. They quickly became
inseparable.


They were first seen in public together on the ski slopes at the
chic Swiss resort of Klosters in April 2004.


Media pressure on Kate has mounted in recent months amid
speculation of an imminent engagement announcement.


In January, when she celebrated her 25th birthday, she was
harassed by paparazzi who see her as a new Princess Diana, the
prince's late glamorous mother, who died 10 years ago in a Paris
car crash while she was being pursued by reporters.
