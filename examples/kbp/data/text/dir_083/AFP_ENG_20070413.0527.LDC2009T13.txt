Leigh Steinberg, the high-powered sports agent thought to have
inspired the Tom Cruise movie "Jerry Maguire" was arrested on
suspicion of drunken driving on Friday, police said.


The 58-year-old was arrested after the luxury sports utility
vehicle he was driving crashed into several parked cars shortly
after midnight in Newport Beach, a well-to-do coastal community
south of Los Angeles.


Steinberg, a Newport Beach resident, has represented a host of
sports superstars, including National Football League stars Steve
Young and Troy Aikman and former heavyweight world champion
Lennox Lewis.


Steinberg underwent a blood alcohol test and was released on his
own recognizance, Newport Beach police seargent Evan Sailor said.


Steinberg, 58, was on his way home when his 2002 Mercedes-Benz ML
500 struck three parked cars, which were parked near the Balboa
Bay Club, Sailor said.


In 1996, Steinberg was sentenced to 40 hours of community
service, placed on three years probation and fined after he
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving.
