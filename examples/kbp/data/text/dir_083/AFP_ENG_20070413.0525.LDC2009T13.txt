US President George W. Bush will meet in July with his Polish
counterpart Lech Kaczynski to discuss proposals to base a US
anti-missile shield in eastern Europe, the White House said
Friday.


"Under President Kaczynski's leadership, Poland has been one of
the United States' closest allies in advancing and consolidating
democracy in Europe and around the globe," said White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino.


"Poland is a leading strategic partner in the war on terror,
supporting stability and freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan," she
added.


She said Poland had "also expressed its interest in contributing
to a missile defense system" which would be discussed by the two
men during their meeting on July 16.


The United States has asked the Czech Republic and Poland to host
a radar system and interceptor rockets respectively, but the plan
has been sharply criticized by Russia.
