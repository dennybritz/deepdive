Even the most powerful man in the world can't escape the taxman,
and US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura had to cough
up 186,000 dollars in 2006, the White House said Friday.


But Bush can perhaps take some comfort from the fact that he has
to pay less than half the amount demanded from his notoriously
wealthier Vice President Dick Cheney.


Bush must pay some 186,378 dollars in taxes for 2006 on an
taxable income of some 642,905 dollars which included his salary
of about 400,000 dollars as well as investment incomes, the White
House said in a statement.


Cheney, and his wife Lynne, declared some 1,614,862 dollars in
earned income, which included the vice president's government
salary of 208,575 dollars as well as royalties from his wife's
books and an advance for a forthcoming novel.


Their combined tax bill came to some 413,326 dollars.


The Bushs' tax returns also showed they donated some 78,100
dollars to churches, charitable organizations and the volunteer
firefighters in Crawford, Texas, where their family ranch is
located.


The Cheneys donated more than 104,000 dollars to worthy causes,
which brings their charitable gifts to more than 7.8 million
dollars since the start of the vice-presidency in 2001.
