Thousands of people gathered in the Albanian capital on Friday to
rally against what they said was attempts by the government to
limit press freedoms.


The rally, organised by left-wing opposition parties, follows a
series of financial investigations launched into several media
outlets in recent weeks. Ordered by Prime Minister Sali Berisha's
government, officials say they are part of a government crackdown
on tax evasion.


Press organisations and others argue the investigations target
only news media outlets that have criticised the right-wing
government.


"The freedom of press has been threatened," journalist and
political analyst Andrea Stefani told attendees at the rally,
where several popular music groups performed.


On Monday, an explosion damaged a vehicle belonging to an
Albanian opposition politician who is also the editor of a
newspaper that has been critical of the government.


Government spokeswoman Majlinda Bregu said "it is neither honest,
nor ethical, nor professional" to see the fight against tax
evasions as a "fight against freedom of press."


"The government demands laws to be respected and full
transparency of funds used by media owners," she insisted.


Some 25 dailies and 100 radio and TV stations operate in Albania,
one of Europe's poorest countries with a population of around 3.8
million.


Berisha has also recently accused some media outlets of being run
by the mafia, angering opposition and non-governmental groups.
