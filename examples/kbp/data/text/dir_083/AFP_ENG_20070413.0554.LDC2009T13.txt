The party of former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba, whose
guards recently clashed with the military, walked out of
parliament on Friday saying their safety is threatened, a party
official said.


Thomas Luhaka said they would not return to parliament until
security arrangements are in place.


The party says the homes of several of its members have been
searched and looted by police and military in recent days.


"We have decided to suspend until further notice our
participation in the work of parliament while waiting for
security conditions to be brought together," said Luhaka.


Bemba's forces and the military clashed last month in Kinshasa,
killing at least 200. Bemba took refuge in the South African
embassy and has since flown out to Portugal, ostensibly for
medical treatment.


The clashes occurred after Bemba, also a former rebel leader and
failed presidential candidate, refused to have his guard
integrated into the regular army.


This week, DRC's state prosecutor requested that the Senate lift
Bemba's immunity so he can be charged with murder. He currently
has immunity because of his Senate seat.


Bemba supporters have dismissed the request as a political
manoeuvre.
