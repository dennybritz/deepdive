Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels shot dead four people in eastern Sri
Lanka on Saturday as the country marked the traditional New Year,
the military said.


Gunmen from the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
opened fire on four men believed to be from a breakaway rebel
faction at Eravur, a military official said.


The killings came as both the majority Sinhalese and the minority
Tamil community marked their common New Year on Saturday.


The Tigers on Friday vowed to hit back against an advance by
government troops in the east of Sri Lanka where a breakaway
faction known as the "Karuna Group" is collaborating with
security forces to attack Tigers.


The LTTE denied military claims that they were retreating in the
face of an onslaught in the Eastern Province, where they were
ejected from a coastal stronghold in January, and said they would
retaliate "very soon."


More than 4,000 people died between December 2005 and the first
week of March 2007 across the country, including 675 civilians
and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence ministry
figures.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.
