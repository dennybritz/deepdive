Two suicide bombers blew themselves up outside a US cultural
centre in the Moroccan city of Casablanca on Saturday, security
forces said.


One of the pair asked a policeman for access to the Dar America
cultural centre in Casablanca but when asked why he and the other
bomber blew themselves up, security officials said.


On Wednesday, Moroccan police said they were hunting for some 10
possible suicide bombers, a day after three suicide bombers blew
themselves up on in Casablanca as they were pursued by police.


The three were wanted in connection with a March 11 explosion at
a Casablanca Internet cafe linked to another suspected militant.
