Group of Seven finance chiefs Friday said excessive volatility on
foreign exchange markets was "undesirable" and called on China to
allow its currency to appreciate faster.


"Excess volatility movements in exchange rates are undesirable
for economic growth," G7 finance ministers and central bankers
said in a statement after a meeting here.


"In emerging economies with large and growing current account
surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective
exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments can occur," the
statement said.
