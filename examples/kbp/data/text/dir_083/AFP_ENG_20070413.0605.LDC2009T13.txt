South Africa's Ernie Els fired a six-under 65 here Friday to
seize a three-shot lead after two rounds of the 5.4 million-
dollar Heritage.


A two-time US Open champion and British Open winner, Els overtook
first round leader Jerry Kelly, who finished at one-under 70
after a bogey on his final hole.


Els ranks fifth in the world but has not won on the PGA Tour in
almost three years, struggling since surgery to repair a ruptured
knee ligament in 2005.


He missed the cut at the Masters last week - his first missed cut
in a major since the 1999 PGA Championship.


Els, who has six top-10 finishes in eight previous trips here,
shot his second straight 65 for a 12-under total of 130.


His bogey-free round included six birdies, five of them on the
front nine.


Kelly, who finished tied for fifth at The Masters last weekend,
picked up where he left off in Thursday's first round with a 63.


But he couldn't maintain the pace and was seven shots worse in
the second round.


Fred Funk, who is dividing his playing time between the US tour
and the Champions Tour, matched his opening-round 67 and was tied
for third with Australia's Stephen Leaney (68) at 8-under.


Zach Johnson, the Masters champion, carded a 68 to climb to
4-under for the tournament - locked into a nine-way tie for 13th
place with a group that includes Sweden's Jesper Parnevik.
