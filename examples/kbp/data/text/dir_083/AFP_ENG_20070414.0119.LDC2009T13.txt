Two suicide bombers blew themselves up outside a US cultural
centre in the Moroccan city of Casablanca on Saturday, security
forces said.


One of the pair asked a policeman manning a checkpoint 100 meters
(yards) from the Dar America cultural centre in Casablanca for
access to the building. But when asked for a reason, he and the
other bomber set off their explosives, security officials said.


A passerby was also injured in the blasts.


On Wednesday, Moroccan police said they were hunting for some 10
possible suicide bombers, a day after three suicide bombers blew
themselves up in Casablanca as they were pursued by police.


A police official said Saturday's incident was "a desperate act
in response to the successful crackdown in recent weeks by the
police and security services to dismantle terrorist cells".


One of the trio who killed themselves on Tuesday was the brother
of a man who died in a March 11 explosion at a Casablanca
Internet cafe that sparked the latest police operation.


The latest blasts come days after suicide bomb attacks at two
locations in the capital of neighbouring Algeria on Wednesday,
killing 33 people and injuring more than 220. One of the blasts
was outside the government headquarters.


On Saturday, the US embassy in Algiers said issued a warning that
militants may be planning more attacks in the centre of the
capital.


"According to unconfirmed information, there may be attacks in
Algiers planned for April 14, 2007 in areas that may include the
Algiers Central Post Office ... and Algerian State Television
Headquarters, ENTV.., among others," an embassy statement said.
