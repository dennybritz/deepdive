British finance minister Gordon Brown, who is expected to take
over from Tony Blair as prime minister, has held talks for the
first time with US President George W. Bush, his department said
Friday.


A spokesman for the Treasury in London confirmed media reports
here that the pair's first face-to-face talks came as Brown was
in Washington for meetings at the International Monetary Fund.


The two men discussed Afghanistan and Iraq as well as trade
during 45 minutes of talks at the White House.


Both the BBC and The Guardian newspaper, which carried a lengthy
interview with the chancellor of the exchequer Saturday, said
Brown was at the White House for talks with Bush's national
security adviser Stephen Hadley.


The meeting with the president was unplanned, they added.


One of the key issues facing Brown when he assumes power within
the next few months is his relationship with the United States
and the president.


Blair was personally and politically close to former president
Bill Clinton but has been criticised for his perceived
unquestioning loyalty to Bush, particularly over the divisive
Iraq war and Israel's bombing of Lebanon.


But setting out his stall for the leadership of the governing
Labour Party at its annual conference last September, Brown
showed few signs of distancing himself from Blair's unpopular
foreign policies.


Some analysts even see him as more of an Atlanticist than Blair
and more in tune with US politics. His favoured holiday
destination is Cape Cod, on the US east coast.
