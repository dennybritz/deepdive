Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath has said his team will aim
for the early dismissal of in-form Sri Lankan opener Sanath
Jayasuriya in their next World Cup match.


"There is no doubt he (Jayasuriya) is a great player and we'd
like to get on top of him early and knock him over. We are just
concentrating on this," said McGrath, whose side take on Sri
Lanka in Grenada on Monday.


"From what we've seen, the pitch in Grenada is slower and takes
some turn. It will be a big test for us, and probably suit Sri
Lanka."


Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals
after whipping debutants Ireland by nine wickets in a Super
Eights match here on Friday. They now lead the table with 10
points from five matches.


McGrath played a big role in Australia's victory, grabbing three
early wickets on a lively track to help his side dismiss the Cup
debutants for 91. He was named man of the match.


"It (the pitch) had a lot more bounce than the others we've
played on. To me, this is what West Indies cricket is about. I
grew up watching four fast bowlers on fast, bouncy wickets," said
McGrath.


"There was good carry, although a few kept a bit low. We look
forward to be hopefully back here for the final. Not many teams
can beat us when we play well. If all goes well, I'll get four
more matches and then hang the boots up."


McGrath, who has already quit Test cricket, is playing in his
last World Cup.
