Cambodia on Saturday confirmed a new outbreak of bird flu among
poultry a little more than a week after a 13-year-old girl died
of the deadly H5N1 virus.


The government said the fresh outbreak was discovered earlier
this week in chickens and ducks raised in a family's backyard
farm in Kampong Cham province, 124 kilometres (77 miles) east of
the capital Phnom Penh.


"We have a new outbreak of bird flu," Agriculture, Forest and
Fisheries Minister Chan Sarun told AFP.


The discovery came after the Cambodian girl died of bird flu last
Thursday, becoming the kingdom's seventh fatality from the H5N1
virus. Her death prompted the government to launch a week-long
bird flu awareness blitz.


Following the latest outbreak, authorities killed some 100
chickens and ducks at the backyard farm in the eastern province,
said the minister.


Cambodia has been praised by the United Nations for its rapid
action against bird flu, which has helped spare it from the human
and poultry deaths suffered by its neighbours.


But health officials also warn that the virus could go undetected
in the countless small family farms where most of Cambodia's
poultry are raised.


Cambodia has also tightened border controls to prevent poultry
from being smuggled from Thailand and Vietnam, which have
reported 17 and 42 bird flu deaths respectively.


The World Health Organisation says the deadly H5N1 strain has
infected more than 290 people and killed 171 of them, mostly in
Southeast Asia, since 2003.
