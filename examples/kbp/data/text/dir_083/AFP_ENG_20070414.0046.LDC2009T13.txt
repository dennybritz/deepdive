A suicide bomber Saturday blew up his car against a checkpoint on
a Baghdad bridge killing 10 people and wounding 15, a security
official said.


The blast occurred on the Jadiriyah bridge in the central Karrada
district of the capital.


Most of the casualties were civilians, the official added.


The bridge is the second targeted by insurgents in the past three
days.


On Thursday, a truck bomb exploded on the Al-Sarafiyah bridge on
the River Tigris, killing 10 people and sending several cars
plunging into the water below.
