Google announced on Friday that it is buying online advertising
firm DoubleClick for 3.1 billion dollars.


The Mountain View, California-based Internet search colossus will
combine DoubleClick's technology with its proven advertising
platform.


Google and DoubleClick, which is based in New York City, will
provide an efficient way to manage both search and display ads
online, according to Google chief executive Eric Schmidt.


"We've come to an agreement to purchase DoubleClick," Schmidt
said in a conference call from Argentina, where Google is opening
a new office.


"It is something we have thought about for a very long time."
