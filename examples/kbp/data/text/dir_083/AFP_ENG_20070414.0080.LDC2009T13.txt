Jordan's King Abdullah II will hold separate talks next week with
Israel Knesset speaker Dalia Yitzik, Palestinian and US peace
activists amid efforts to relaunch Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations, a palace official told AFP on Saturday.


Yitzik "will visit Jordan on Thursday (April 19) at the
invitation of King Abdullah II for a few hours" for talks on
reviving the peace process, the official said, confirming an
announcement made Friday in Jerusalem but which gave no date.


She will be preceded to Amman by separate non-government
Palestinian and US peace activists on Monday and Tuesday
respectively, the official said.


The visits are part of efforts by Jordan to move forward the
peace process and raise support for an Arab peace initiative
adopted by Arab leaders at a summit in Saudi Arabia at the end of
March.
