A Taiwanese zoo on Saturday admitted that it has mistakenly
identified for eight years a crocodile that bit off a vet's left
forearm.


A local wildlife expert viewing dramatic television footage of
Wednesday's attack pointed out that the animal resembled a
saltwater crocodile from Asia rather a Nile crocodile from
Africa.


The reptile, kept at the Shou Shan Zoo in Kaohsiung city, bit off
the vet's arm and held it in its mouth.


It only let go when a police officer fired two bullets into its
body, in scenes caught on camera and broadcast around the world.


The zoo admitted that it made an identification error.


"After an examination by the National Pingtung University of
Science and Technology, it is determined that the animal is a
saltwater crocodile," zoo official Chen Po-tsai told reporters as
the sign "Nile crocodile" was replaced with the correct name.


"We have a shortage of staff with only three vets and three
technicians. It is difficult to distinguish the species without a
team of experts," he said.


Chang Po-yu, the 38-year-old vet who was attacked, was recovering
in a stable condition in hospital after six hours of surgery
which re-attached his arm.


Meanwhile, the 300-kilogramme (660-pound) male crocodile survived
the shooting and is now attracting lots of visitors to its
enclosure, zoo officials said.
