Second-seeded American James Blake bucked the upset trend here
Friday, battling through to the semi-finals of the US men's clay
court championships with a win over Juan Monaco.


After third-seeded German Tommy Haas and No. 5 Jurgen Melzer of
Austria had bowed out with quarter-final losses, Blake held on
for a 7-6 (7/5), 1-6, 7-6 (7/0) victory over eighth-seeded Monaco
of Argentina.


The two traded breaks of serve in the third set to go to the
tiebreaker, when Blake took control and won the final seven
points to close out the 2hr, 11 minute contest.


Blake, who has reached the semi-finals of this event for the
first time, will try to reach his third ATP final of the year
when he meets another Argentinian, qualfier Mariano Zabaleta.


Zabaleta advanced to an ATP semi-final for the first time since
2005 with his 6-1, 6-2 victory over last year's runner-up Melzer.


Zabaleta also beat 2006 champion Mardy Fish in the second round.


Zabaleta, currently ranked No. 156, missed nearly five months
last year with a knee injury and he finished out of the top 100
for the first time since 1997.


Croatia's Ivo Karlovic, who was also hampered by a knee injury
last year, defeated world No. 10 Haas, using just one break of
serve to earn the 7-6 (9/7), 6-4 victory.


Karlovic next meets Albert Montanes of Spain, a 6-4, 6-4 winner
over American Vince Spadea.
