Striking workers paralyzed an iron mine owned by the Chinese
company Shougang in southern Peru by blocking the route to the
site, the company said on Friday.


"The business isn't functioning and production has been halted
since the workers blocked the road," the mine's director general
Raul Vera told AFP.


He estimated it would lose 400,000 dollars a day from the
stoppage which started Tuesday.


The 300 workers launched the strike to protest the company's
decision not to renew the jobs of seven employees. On Thursday
some of those involved in the action set fire to an
administrative building at the site.


The mine, located in the town of Macona some 400 kilometers (250
miles) south of the capital Lima, yields some 20,000 tonnes of
iron ore a day -- more than seven million tonnes a year.


Its profits leapt in 2006 to 23.3 million dollars from 6.5
million the previous year, according to figures from Peru's
official market monitor Conasev.
