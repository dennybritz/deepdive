Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone took time on Saturday to
praise the manner in which British rookie Lewis Hamilton has
adapted to the sport.


Ecclestone explained to reporters how he hoped the McLaren
Mercedes-Benz driver could become the next superstar of the
sport, but played down his heritage as being a factor.


Hamilton, the second black driver in Formula One after Indian
Narain Karthikeyan, but the first of Afro-Caribbean descent, came
third in his Formula One debut in Australia and second in
Malaysia last week and has had his impact likened to that of
American golfing superstar Tiger Woods although Ecclestone
refused to draw similarities.


"He is good for F1," said Ecclestone. "I wish people wouldn't
keep on talking about him being coloured and all that because he
doesn't need to have the praise because he happens to be
coloured.


"He is just bloody good. I hope he will be the next superstar of
F1," he added.


"He has got all the makings of doing so. Lewis is doing a great
job. He has obviously done an awful lot better than anybody
expected him to."


Hamilton added weight to Ecclestone's superstar' claims by
finishing first and eclipsing the pace of Finnish driver Kimi
Raikkonen's Ferrari by 0.006 seconds in the final practice
session on Saturday ahead of afternoon qualifying.
