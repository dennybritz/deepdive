Ivory Coast's new prime minister and ex-rebel leader Guillaume
Soro Friday appealed for reconciliation in the war-divided
country.


"We must now learn how to forgive. It is the price we have to pay
for reconciliation to be possible," Soro said in his first
address to the nation since taking up office two weeks ago.


He made the appeal as President Laurent Gbagbo signed into law an
amnesty for crimes committed during the country's civil conflict,
giving a fresh boost to the unfolding new peace process in the
west African country split into two by four years of a war.


Declaring that he is not standing for elections to be organised
later this year to cap the fragile peace scheme, Soro said his
government's main objective is resolve the political crisis.


A lasting solution to the crisis rocking the country would be
achieved through a population identification scheme,
reunification of the rebel and government forces and
"organisation of fair and transparent elections open to all," he
said.


Gbagbo and Soro secured a landmark peace deal brokered by Burkina
Faso to end the low-key but protracted civil conflict in this
cocoa rich-country, which has been politically and militarily
divided for the past four years.


The agreement, which gave Soro the post of prime minister, also
allowed for the end of the geographical split of the country by
removing a foreign-patrolled buffer zone separating the rebel-
held north and government-run south.


The zone is to be cleared in a phased process starting Monday.
