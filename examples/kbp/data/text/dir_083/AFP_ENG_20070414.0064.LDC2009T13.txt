British tennis hope Andy Murray is certain of breaking into the
world top 10 on Monday despite being idle this week.


The 19-year-old Scot's place among the planet's elite was ensured
on Friday when Germany's Tommy Haas lost 7-6, 6-4 to giant
Croatian Ivo Karlovic in the quarter-finals of the ATP tournament
in Houston.


Haas, ranked 10 going into the US Clay Court Championships, had
needed to reach the smei-finals to make sure he stayed there.


His defeat means that Murray will move up one spot from his
latest ranking of 11 when the ATP rankings are released on
Monday.


"I have been up all night watching the live scores to see what
was happening with the Haas match and I can't believe it," Murray
said on his official website www.andymurray.com.


"I've been working the last five years of my life to get here and
it has finally happened - I'm in shock."


Murray is next in action on clay at the Masters Series event in
Monte Carlo which begins on Monday.
