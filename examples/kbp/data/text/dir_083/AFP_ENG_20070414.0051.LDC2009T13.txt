A car bomb killed at least 40 people and wounded 58 in a shopping
area near the Imam Hussein shrine in Iraq's Shiite holy city of
Karbala on Saturday, a medical source said.


The medic from the local hospital said many of the victims were
women and children, while four of the wounded were Iranian
pilgrims.


He said that the bomb went off at a bus station which is
surrounded by many shops.


A security official earlier said that the blast ripped through
the shopping area at around 9:15 am (0515 GMT).


The blast occurred about 200 metres (yards) from the revered Imam
Hussein shrine.
