US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Friday expressed his "very
high regard" for scandal-hit World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz,
reinforcing Washington's support for the embattled official.


"I have a very high regard for Paul Wolfowitz as a professional.
Paul Wolfowitz is a very dedicated public servant," Paulson told
a press conference after a meeting of the Group of Seven nations.


"He's apologized, the bank has a process in place to review this
and Paul has said that this process is appropriate and I agree
with him," the Treasury secretary said.


The former deputy US defense secretary faces calls to resign over
a pay scandal involving his girlfriend, who was reassigned from
her World Bank job to the US State Department to prevent any
conflicts of interest with Wolfowitz.


Earlier Friday a White House spokesman said President George W.
Bush "fully supports Wolfowitz and wants him to continue his
service as World Bank president."


Paulson declined to comment further pending the outcome of what
steps the World Bank's executive board intends to take over the
affair.


"But let me add though that this should not call into question or
be read as any lessening of US support for Paul Wolfowitz," he
said.
