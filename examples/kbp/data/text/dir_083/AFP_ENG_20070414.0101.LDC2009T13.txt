A landmine killed nine Sudanese army soldiers and wounded 11 on
Sudan's eastern border with Ethiopia, army spokesman Brigadier
Osman al-Aghbash said on Saturday.


The spokesman, quoted by Khartoum press, said the blast occurred
on Friday when the troops were driving on the border Qidaimah-
Shahabah road in Fashaqa locality "for an administrative
mission."


Aghbash said the landmine was placed as part of "practices being
carried out by the Shifta (Ethiopian) bandits targeting the
civilians and stability of the region."


Two officers were among the wounded taken to hospital, Aghbash
said.
