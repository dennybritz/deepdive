Taiwanese officials said Saturday they have suspended imports of
New Zealand apples after a codling moth larva was found in a
shipment.


The larva was found Thursday in a shipment of apples to central
Taichung city, said Chang Shih-yang, an official with the Bureau
of Animal and Plant Health Inspection.


"We have notified the New Zealand government not to export apples
to Taiwan until the quarantine measures are improved," Chang
said.


This was the first time the bureau had found codling moth larvae
-- which can do extensive damage to apples and pears -- in
shipments from New Zealand, he said.


New Zealand is Taiwan's fourth largest supplier of apples, after
the United State, Chile and Japan, according to agriculture
authorities.


In 2006 Taiwan imported some 14,000 tons of apples from New
Zealand, accounting for 12.3 percent of overall imports.
