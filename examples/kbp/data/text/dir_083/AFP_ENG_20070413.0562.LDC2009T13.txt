England World Cup winner Jason Robinson signed off his club rugby
union career with a Hollywood ending on Friday as he scored the
try-winning score to give his club Sale a 25-23 English
Premiership victory over Bath.


The 32-year-old former Rugby League legend left it late to leave
his final mark on the union club scene - although he remains
available for selection for England's World Cup squad -  as he
touched down 10 seconds from time.


Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe's converted try and two Lee Thomas
penalties helped the Sharks into a 13-3 lead.


But Nick Walshe and David Barnes scored tries just after the
break as Bath rattled up 20 unanswered points.


Selorm Kuadey put Sale back in touch with a converted try before
Robinson signed off in style.


The stage was all set for a fairytale finish and it duly arrived
with 10 seconds left on the clock.


Robinson - who scored England's only try in their epic victory
over Australia in the 2003 World Cup final triumph which ended
with Jonny Wilkinson landing a winning drop goal in the dying
seconds of extra-time - burst onto the ball 30 metres out and
broke through the Bath defence to say goodbye to the Sale fans in
style.


Robinson - who quit Sale because he was frustrated over the delay
of being offered a year's contract - missed the conversion but
few cared as the injury- ravaged Sharks collected a first victory
since January.
