Indian troops have shot dead seven suspected Islamic militants in
two gunbattles in revolt-hit Indian Kashmir, police said
Saturday.


Two rebels were killed in a clash Saturday with troops in Pulwama
district, 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of summer capital
Srinagar, said police, who did not divulge further details.


Five more were killed in a four-hour gunbattle in the mountains
of southern Doda district late Friday, police said.


"The five had taken shelter in two empty log houses of shepherds
when the Indian army, backed by police, ringed them from
outside," a police spokesman said, adding the rebels opened fire
when they spied the soldiers.


The five belonged to several hardline groups including the pro-
Pakistan Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the spokesman
said, adding, "three of the slain militants were senior
commanders."


More than 42,000 people have died in Kashmir by official count
since rebels launched a bloody insurgency against Indian rule in
1989.


Human rights groups put the death toll at 70,000, including
around 10,000 people who were reported missing over the years and
now are presumed dead.


Indian police have recently been probing five cases in which
innocent civilians were allegedly killed and passed off as
militants.


Some 17 security force personnel and a civilian have been charged
with murder in two of the cases.
