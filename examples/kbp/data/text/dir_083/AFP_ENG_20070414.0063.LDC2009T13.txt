A suicide bomber Saturday blew himself up at the gate of a police
headquarters in eastern Afghanistan, killing and wounding more
than a dozen people, a police commander told AFP.


The attack in Khost which borders Pakistan is the latest in a
wave of Iraq-style suicide bombings which has rocked Afghanistan
in recent months.


"There was a suicide bombing at the main gate of the border
police headquarters. More than 12 people including policemen and
civilians were killed and injured," police commander Qasem Khil
said.
