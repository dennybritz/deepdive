Britain's Prince William and his girlfriend, Kate Middleton, have
split up, the Sun newspaper reported Saturday.


The mass circulation daily quoted a close friend as saying the
pressure had become too much for them, particularly because the
24-year-old prince's military duties meant they were rarely
together and because of the enormous media interest in Middleton,
living alone in London.


"As far as Kate is concerned, William simply hasn't paid her
enough attention," the friend said. "She is stuck in London while
he is living in an officer's mess in Dorset. Kate feels hugely
frustrated."
