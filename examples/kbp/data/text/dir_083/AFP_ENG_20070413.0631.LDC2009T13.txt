Barry Bonds took two more steps toward baseball history on
Friday, bashing career home runs numbers 736 and 737 in San
Francisco's 8-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.


The Giants slugger, who had been without a homer since his first
blast of the season last Tuesday against San Diego's Chris Young,
lined an inside breaking ball from Pittsburgh starter Zach Duke
into the right field seats in the second inning for a 7-2 lead.


Two innings later, he sent an offering from Shawn Chacon deep
over the wall in right-center field for an 8-2 edge.


The blasts came in the city where Bonds began his major league
career.


The seven-time Most Valuable Player, who also opened the scoring
with an RBI single in the first, left in the fourth inning after
completing his 70th multi- homer game - second all-time to Babe
Ruth's 72.


Bonds is 19 home runs shy of breaking Hank Aaron's all-time
record of 755 homers - well on track to break the hallowed mark
this season.


Giants manager Bruce Bochy said he pulled the 42-year-old Bonds
to keep his legs fresh.


But he was delighted with his veteran, who had struggled in the
earliest stage of the season with a .192 batting average, one
home run and four RBI.


The Giants' offense as a whole had been off to a rough start,
batting .232 with just two home runs heading into Friday's
contest.


"What a day he had," Bochy said of Bonds. "We've been trying to
get this offense going and that's what we needed."
