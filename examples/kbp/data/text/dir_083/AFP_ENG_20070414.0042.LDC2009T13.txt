A car bomb killed at least 40 people in a shopping area near the
Imam Hussein shrine in Iraq's Shiite holy city of Karbala on
Saturday, a medical source said.


The medic from the local hospital said many of the victims were
women and children, adding that the bomb went off at a bus
station which is surrounded by many shops.
