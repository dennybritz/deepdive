A joint NATO and Afghan military offensive in the restive Helmand
province of Afghanistan killed 24 Taliban Friday, the province's
police chief told AFP.


Mohammad Nabi Mullahkhil said there were no victims among the
Afghan or NATO forces and did not have any details of further
Taliban injuries during the fighting in the district of Garmser.
His reports could not be confirmed.


A spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) could not be contacted Friday.


Helmand is a the setting for daily battles between insurgents and
ISAF and Afghan forces, who on March 6 launched a major offensive
in the area against the Taliban.


On Thursday, US and Afghan troops backed by warplanes killed more
than 35 Taliban militants during a five-hour battle in the
bitterly contested district of Sangin, also in Helmand.
