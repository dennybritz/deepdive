Russian police arrested opposition leader and former chess
champion Gary Kasparov on Saturday and dozens of supporters as
they tried to march to central Moscow's Pushkin Square, an AFP
correspondent said.


Kasparov, one of the leaders of The Other Russia opposition
movement, was put on a police bus shortly after attempting to
enter the square.


Police also detained about a dozen foreign journalists, an AFP
correspondent said.


Separately, dozens of protestors were detained and put aboard
police buses.
