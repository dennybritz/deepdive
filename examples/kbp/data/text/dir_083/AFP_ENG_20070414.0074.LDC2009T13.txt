A suicide bomber Saturday blew himself up at the gate of a police
headquarters in eastern Afghanistan, killing at least eight
policemen and some civilians, police and medics said.


The attack in Khost which borders Pakistan is the latest in a
wave of Iraq-style suicide bombings which have rocked Afghanistan
in recent months.


"There was a suicide bombing at the main gate of the border
police headquarters. More than 12 people including policemen and
civilians were killed and injured," police commander Qasem Khil
said.


He said the casualties included several civilians.


"We have got so far eight policemen dead, whose bodies were
brought to our hospital," doctor Gul Mohammaddin Mohammadi from
the Khost city hospital told AFP.


"Six other cops were also brought with injuries," he said.
