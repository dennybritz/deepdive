Several conservative groups Friday launched a lawsuit against the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for allowing over-the-
counter sales of the 'morning after' contraceptive pill.


"The FDA buckled to pressure to do something it has never done
before, make a high dose of a drug available without a
prescription when a low dose of the same drug requires a
prescription," the Concerned Women for America group said.


In particular the group has taken issue with the FDA's sudden
decision in August to allow over-the-counter sales of the
morning-after pill.


This was a result of "improper political pressure exerted by
Senators (Hillary) Clinton and (Patty) Murray," the group
alleged.


It accused the two senators of threatening to block the
nomination of Andrew von Eschenbach as the FDA's commissioner
unless the sales were approved.


"The agency skirted laws and regulations put in place to ensure
drugs are safe and effective, relenting under undue pressure from
political operatives," the group said in a statement.


The Christian group the Family Research Council, the American
Association of Physicians and Surgeons, a conservative group of
private doctors, and the organization Safe Drugs for Women have
also joined the move.


The morning-after pill, a contraceptive which can be used up to
72 hours after sexual intercourse, was approved for prescription-
only use in the United States in 1999.
