Polling started Saturday in elections for governors and
legislators for Nigeria's 36 states with the security forces on
full alert.


Many polling stations in different parts of the country appeared
to be opening late.


At the Igbogbo voting station on the eastern outskirts of Lagos,
polling started around 30 minutes behind the scheduled time of 8
a.m. (0700 GMT) with just some 25 people queueing up to vote, an
AFP journalist said.


In the northern commercial capital of Kano voters were queueing
up at stations that were still waiting for voting materials,
according to an AFP correspondent there.


In the southern oil capital of Port Harcourt, where two police
stations were burned down overnight and seven policemen killed,
polling stations in those parts of town were deserted.


In Kano, where a radical Muslim cleric was shot dead in a mosque
on Friday, residents spoke of heavy military deployment and
numerous checkpoints.


The military were also out in full force manning checkpoints at
key road junctions in differnt parts of Lagos where the streets
were abnormally quiet.


The governorship vote is seen as a rehearsal for next Saturday's
presidential poll.
