Sierra Leone lawmakers approved a law to establish the country's
first ever stock exchange, state radio reported on Friday.


Deputy Finance Minister Joe Kallon told lawmakers that the
introduction of the stock exchange in the war-scarred west
African country is part of the government's efforts to revamp the
shattered economy.


"We are sure the (exchange) will improve the economic status of
the country," he said.


The stock market is expected to be operational by year end,
according to the country's central bank.


A 10-year civil war which ended in 2001 cost thousands of lives
and reduced Sierra Leone's economy to the extent that it became
the world's second most poverty-stricken country.
