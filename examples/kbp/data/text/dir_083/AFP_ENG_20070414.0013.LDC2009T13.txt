Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday renewed his pledge to
pursue a "beautiful Japan" as he invited some 11,000 guests to
his first cherry blossom viewing party.


"The parliament session has entered the second half. I will make
my utmost efforts to make Japan an even more beautiful nation,"
Abe said on the day after his government paved the way to start
revising the country's pacifist constitution.


Abe has vowed to create a more assertive Japan under his favorite
campaign phrase "a beautiful nation" and made revising the 1947
constitution, imposed by the United States after World War II,
the top item on his political agenda.


At the party celebrated under clear skies, Abe said, "We have the
fair weather today with the cherry flowers fully bloomed because
your wishes reached up there, I believe."


Japan's prime ministers customarily invite guests including some
celebrity figures from entertainment and sports to an annual
flower viewing party in a Tokyo park.


Cherry trees, whose delicate but short-lived blossoms have left
poets over the centuries pondering the ephemeral nature of
beauty, are also seen as a symbol of Japan's nationalistic
sentiment.


Japan's House of Representatives on Friday passed a controversial
bill to establish a national referendum, the first step towards
rewriting the constitution.


The bill will now go to the upper house where its approval is
also likely, as conservative Abe's coalition holds an
overwhelming majority in both the lower and upper houses.
