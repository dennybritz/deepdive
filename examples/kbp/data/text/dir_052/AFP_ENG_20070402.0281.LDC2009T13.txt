Weaker imports helped Indonesia to a 3.66-billion-dollar trade
surplus in February, up from the previous month, official data
showed Monday.


The sprawling, archipelago nation posted a rise on the 3.11
-billion-dollar surplus in January, statistics chief Rusman
Heriawan said.


Exports were little changed at 8.32 billion dollars in February,
but imports dropped sharply to 4.66 billion dollars from 5.24
billion dollars the previous month.


"In general, our export performance remained good despite
flooding disrupting transportation to ports during the first two
weeks of the month," Heriawan said, referring to massive flooding
in and around Jakarta in February.


Japan consumed the largest chunk of Indonesian exports in
February, some 915.5 million dollars' worth, followed by the US,
Singapore, China and Malaysia.


Indonesia's exports hit a record high of 9.5 billion dollars in
December.
