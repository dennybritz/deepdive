Housing markets in the 13 nations sharing the euro currency show
signs of cooling, especially in Spain, even though lending for
home purchases remains strong, European Central Bank president
Jean-Claude Trichet said in an interview published on Monday.


Lending for house purchases was "very dynamic" in the eurozone
last year, with an annual rate of growth of 9.4 percent, he told
daily Spanish business newspaper Expansion.


"This dynamism was one of the details which the ECB took into
account when making its decisions. Besides I would say that
everything that nations can do to contain these adverse events
would be encouraging," he said.


"But I would like to emphasize that we are seeing a certain
slowdown in national housing markets, particularly in Spain," he
added.


The ECB raised its key interest rates to a five-and-a-half-year
high of 3.75 percent last month and has signalled that a further
rise is possible in coming months. Financial markets expect
another quarter percentage point rise in June.


Trichet was in Spain last week for a meeting of central bankers
from eurozone and Mediterranean countries.
