Researchers say they have discovered two enzymes that may safely
convert blood groups A, B and AB to group O, the "universal"
blood used in transfusions.


Under the ABO system of blood classification established in 1900,
group O red cells can be given to all individuals.


But A can only be given to A and AB individuals, and B can only
be given to B and AB individuals. Giving someone the wrong type
can trigger a massive, sometimes fatal attack on the transfused
cells by the host's immune system.


Researchers at the Laboratory for the Architecture and Function
of Biological Macromolecules at the University of Aix at
Marseille, southern France, say the two enzymes break down the
sugary molecules that form the cells' antigens, or the triggers
for the immune response.


These antigens are on the surface of A, B and AB cells, but not
on O cells.


The enzymes are tailored together from two bacteria, one called
Elizabethkingia meningosepticum and the other called Bacteroides
fragilis.


The next phase will be to subject the enzymes to a full battery
of safety tests before they can be used in blood banks.


If all goes well, and the process is not too expensive, the
enzymes could be used to boost universal blood supplies, helping
to overcome shortages.


The study was published on Sunday in the April issue of Nature
Biotechnology, a specialised journal of the Nature group.
