Microsoft co-founder and top philanthropist Bill Gates was in
Vietnam on Monday for a low-key visit to study the communist
country's lauded childhood vaccination programme, officials said.


The world's richest man stayed out of the limelight on his first
return trip since he was feted like a rock star here a year ago
by thousands of university students who idolise the IT messiah.


Gates arrived in Hanoi by private jet on Sunday with his wife
Melinda for a three-day visit during which they were scheduled to
meet public health officials and top government leaders.


"They are here on a kind of study tour to learn more about the
immunisation programme in Vietnam," said World Health
Organisation country representative Hans Troedsson.


Gates' charitable foundation, with almost 30 billion dollars
donated by the high-tech tycoon, funds HIV/AIDS research and
vaccinations against tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases.


The couple was interested in learning about Vietnam's vaccination
programme for diseases including tetanus, measles, polio and
tuberculosis. They would also hold discussions with officials on
other vaccines that Vietnam plans to introduce, Troedsson said.


"Vietnam's immunisation programme is seen as one of the most
successful in the developing countries," said Troedsson.


"They have a coverage of over 90 percent, which even high-income
countries find difficult to reach."
