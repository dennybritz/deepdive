Britain ruled out Monday any climbdown over demands for the
unconditional release of 15 sailors held captive by Iran,
following their "stage-managed" appearances on Iranian
television.


Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman also said that "a lot is
going on behind the scenes" to secure the release of the 15
British naval personnel captured in the northern Gulf on March
23.


"The Iranians know our position. They know that stage-managed TV
appearances aren't going to affect that position. They know that
we have strong international support," the spokesman told a press
briefing.


"We have responded to the Iranians initial letter and we are
waiting for further responses," he said, without elaborating.
"There's a lot going on behind the scenes."


Iranian state television has broadcast footage of the British
personnel apparently confessing to having tresspassed into
Iranian waters.


Britain, which insists they were seized in Iraqi waters, has
voiced outrage at the sailors being paraded on television.
