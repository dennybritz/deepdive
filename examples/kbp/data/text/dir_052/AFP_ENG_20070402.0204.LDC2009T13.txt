Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said Monday he had sent a
new cabinet list to parliament, a day after sacking eight
ministers close to President Traian Basescu, with whom he has an
ongoing feud.


"We weighed each candidate and I hope the new ministers will be
confirmed by parliament," Tariceanu told journalists, adding that
his press office would make the cabinet list public "very soon."


Tariceanu will need the support of the opposition Social Democrat
Party (PSD) for parliament to approve his new government.


The new list includes members of his National Liberal Party as
well as the Democratic Union of Romanian Magyars, which
represents the country's Hungarian minority, but it excludes all
members of Basescu's Democratic Party, until now a partner in the
ruling coalition.


Media reports said the head of the government's Department for
the Fight against Fraud (DLAF), Tudor Chiuariu, 29, would take
over as justice minister, a key position as Brussels could slap
Bucharest with further safeguard measures if it is too slow in
implementing EU-required justice reforms.


Historian and European MP Adrian Cioroianu is to be handed the
foreign ministry while Theodor Melescanu, a former foreign
minister, will be given the defence portfolio.
