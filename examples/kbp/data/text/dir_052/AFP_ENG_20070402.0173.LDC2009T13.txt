Cambodian police have arrested 18 people, including Thai and
Chinese nationals, and seized three tonnes of chemicals used to
make methamphetamines, officials said Monday.


The arrests took place Sunday in Kompong Speu province, some 50
kilometres (31 miles) west of Phnom Penh, provincial governor
Kang Heang told AFP.


"We have monitored them for more than one month ... they were
preparing to produce the drugs," he said, adding that this was
the biggest narcotics bust in the province.


Police found two tonnes of chemicals dumped in a plantation in
Kompong Speu, while the suspects led authorities to another tonne
of chemicals in Phnom Penh.


The chemicals were to be used to produce "yama" or "yaba", a
cheap, potent drug that is widely used throughout Southeast Asia.


"We are investigating where these materials came from and where
they would be smuggled to," Kang Heang said.


Impoverished Cambodia is becoming an increasingly popular
trafficking point for narcotics, particularly methamphetamines
and heroin, after neighbouring Thailand toughened its stance on
illegal drugs in 2002.
