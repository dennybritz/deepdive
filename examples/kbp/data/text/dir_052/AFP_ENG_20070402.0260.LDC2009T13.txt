Thai police have arrested more than 50 North Koreans who entered
the kingdom illegally, a senior immigration police officer said
Monday, and plan to send the migrants back home.


A group of 14 North Koreans, mostly women and children, were
arrested Sunday in northern Chiang Rai province near the infamous
Golden Triangle where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet, Colonel
Jetsada Yaisoon said.


Another 38 have been arrested in small groups at different
locations in Chiang Rai since March 25, he said, highlighting
Thailand's increasing popularity as a transit country for
defectors.


Jetsada told AFP that the migrants had crossed into Thailand from
neighbouring Laos, after they fled North Korea via China.


He said that all 52 migrants were brought to a court in Chiang
Rai and charged with illegal entry. They would be sent to
Bangkok's immigration centre, before being deported to North
Korea, he said.


Chronic food and energy shortages have driven a growing number of
North Koreans from their impoverished homeland.


The number of North Koreans arrested for illegal entry into
Thailand in 2006 surged to more than 400 from 50 in 2005.


Although officials often threaten to deport migrants back to
North Korea in an effort to discourage further defectors, many
end up being relocated to a third country, usually South Korea.
