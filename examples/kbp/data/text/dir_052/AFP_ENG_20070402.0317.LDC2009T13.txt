Amnesty International urged a South Asian bloc Monday to agree on
a human rights charter and work to fight widespread abuses, as
leaders from eight nations gathered for a summit.


"South Asian governments must tie down their commitment to
protection of human rights in their countries through an Asian
Charter of Human Rights," said Purna Sen, Asia-Pacific director
of the London-based rights group.


Sen spoke ahead of Tuesday's start of a two-day summit of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in New
Delhi, where trade and cultural contacts are expected to
dominate.


But Amnesty and other rights groups say many of South Asia's 1.4
billion population live in fear as basic rights come under
increasing threat by corrupt police and a breakdown in the rule
of law -- and that this should also be a topic of regional
coordination.


Security forces and police in Sri Lanka, India, Nepal,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, the Maldives and Afghanistan have
all been accused by rights groups of forced disappearances,
torture and arbitrary arrests.


Various militant groups operating across the region are also
accused of rights abuses.


"SAARC has a mandate of social and economic development," said
Mukul Sharma, the director of Amnesty International India.


"Human rights are key to such development and we call upon SAARC
to promote and protect the human rights of the women, men and
children of South Asia in all of its work."
