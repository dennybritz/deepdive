NFL Europe outfit Hamburg Sea Devils have signed up John David
Washington, son of famed Hollywood actor Denzil, for the coming
season.


Washington, a running-back, was taken on after successfully
coming through a pre-season training camp in Tampa, Florida.


The 23-year-old will join disgraced British sprinter Dwain
Chambers on the roster of Hamburg, one of six teams in the NFL
Europe league that kicks off on April 14.
