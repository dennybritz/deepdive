Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will lead a delegation of
ministers and lawmakers to Japan and South Korea next week to
sign economic agreements with the two countries, a Shiite MP said
on Monday.


"The prime minister will sign trade pacts in the oil and
electricity sectors, as well as signing a loan agreement with
Japan," Sami al-Askari, a lawmaker considered close to the prime
minister, told AFP.


Maliki will visit the two countries from April 8 to 13, he said.
