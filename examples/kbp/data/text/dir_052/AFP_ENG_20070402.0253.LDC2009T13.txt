The world is losing the battle to control the spread of HIV/AIDS,
and governments should not be distracted by other health threats
like bird flu, a Singapore minister said Monday.


"While we are concerned about bird flu and the risk of a bird flu
pandemic, we should not forget HIV/AIDS," Balaji Sadasivan,
senior minister of state for foreign affairs, told a regional
health conference.


"We are losing the battle to control this epidemic. Solutions to
control the epidemic have been only partially effective, and we
are running out of time as the number of infected worldwide is
now 40 million and the number continues to rise."


In Singapore, the number of new diagnosed cases rose from 237 in
2001 to more than 350 last year, he said.


"So the situation today has worsened. This is a truly 'silent
epidemic' that the world needs to band together to address," said
Sadasivan, a neurosurgeon.


AIDS is the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome caught from
unprotected sex and intravenous injection, usually among illegal
drug abusers.


AIDS breaks down a person's immune system, rendering the
individual vulnerable to diseases.


HIV is the virus which causes AIDS, which has no known cure.


Since 2003, avian influenza has killed at least 169 people,
mostly in Southeast Asia.
