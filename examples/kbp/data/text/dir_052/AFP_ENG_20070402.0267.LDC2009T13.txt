Russian airline Aeroflot is a candidate to buy the Italian
government's stake in the troubled carrier Alitalia, the Russian
carrier's banking partner Unicredito Italiano said on Monday.


If their bid is accepted, Unicredit will acquire five percent of
the Alitalia stake being offered while Aeroflot will buy the
remaining 95 percent, a company official said.


The Italian government, which is privatising the airline, has a
49.9 percent stake in Alitalia but plans to sell it down to 10
percent or less.


There are currently three consortia in the bidding process, and
they had until Monday to announce additional partners.


Unicredit gave no indication of what price its group might pay
for the Alitalia stake.


"That's completely linked to the outcome of the due diligence
process," said Sergio Ermotti, deputy managing director of the
Unicredit group and head of the markets and investment banking
division.


Ermotti also declined to comment on a possible change of Alitalia
management should his consortium win the bid.


Trading in Alitalia shares was temporarily suspended early Monday
pending the release of a statement.


A spokeswoman for the Italian government said however that no
statement was expected before the market closed.
