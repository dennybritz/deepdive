A suspicious fire has burned down a synagogue used by an ultra-
Orthodox Jewish group, whose members attended the Iran-sponsored
Holocaust denial conference last year, a local newspaper reported
Monday.


The Journal News published in the Hudson Valley north of here
said police and Rockland County arson investigators viewed the
blaze in the town on Monsey as suspicious because the group known
as Neturei Karta has been the target of threats.


Fire Chief Douglas Perry said downed electrical lines and people
lining the streets temporarily impeded firefighters from getting
into the building, according to the report.


Neturei Karta is made up of Hasidic Jews, who oppose Israel on
religious grounds and believe Jews should live under Arab Muslim
rule until the Messiah comes.


Over the years, they have burned the Israeli flag and met with
people and groups that have vowed to destroy Israel, the paper
said.


In December, Neturei Karta members met with Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and spoke at a seminar for Holocaust deniers
in Iran, The Journal News said.
