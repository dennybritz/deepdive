Israel will not allow the Hamas movement to strengthen in Gaza,
Defence Minister Amir Peretz said on Monday, a day after ordering
the army to take "decisive action" against militants and rocket
fire.


"Israel will not allow Hamas to strengthen in the Gaza Strip and
will prevent rocket fire against its territory," Peretz said,
according to his spokesman Gur Tsalal-Yashin.


"I think difficult questions are being posed in regard to the
ceasefire, which is why we are preparing ourselves for any
scenario," Peretz told army radio.


On Sunday, Peretz ordered the army to take steps to thwart Gaza
militants from firing rockets into the Jewish state.


Under a November 26 ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops from
the Gaza Strip and militants there were supposed to stop firing
rockets.


Since then, more than 150 rockets have hit Israel from Gaza,
wounding two teenagers.


Last week, the first Israeli military action against Gaza
militants since the truce killed one gunman from the radical
Islamic Jihad faction and wounded four others.


Chief of staff Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi said last week
that Israel will have to confront what he called the
strengthening of Gaza militant groups amid reports of persistent
weapons smuggling from Egypt into the coastal strip.
