An Egyptian archaeological delegation returned from France on
Monday with remnants of hair and bandages from one of Egypt's
most famous pharaohs that were nearly sold on the Internet, the
official MENA news agency reported.


Frenchman Jean-Michel Diebolt, a 50-year-old postman living in
the Alps, advertised the samples online for 2,000 euros (2,633
dollars), prompting a storm of outrage from Egypt, which is
particularly sensitive to any pilfering of its heritage.


Diebolt, who was briefly arrested by police, said the samples
came into his possession via his father who was part of a team of
French scientists tasked with analysing the royal mummy 30 years
ago.


Ramses II's mummy, which is currently housed in Cairo's Egyptian
Museum, was sent to Paris in 1976 to treat a fungal infection.


The pharaoh, who reigned from 1279 to 1213 BC, was issued an
Egyptian passport and was received at Paris's Le Bourget airport
with a ceremony fit for a king.


The French lab where the man's father allegedly worked, the
Atomic Energy Commissariat (CEA) in southeastern Grenoble,
confirmed it was sent fragments of the mummy's hair, resin and
bandaging for analysis in 1976 and 1977.


Ramses II is one of Egypt's most powerful pharaohs who filled the
country with vast statues and monuments dedicated to himself.
