Singapore's foreign minister George Yeo arrived Monday in
military-run Myanmar on an official three-day visit, officials
said.


"George Yeo came here at the invitation of the Myanmar
government. He will stay here for three days," an official at the
Singapore embassy confirmed.


Myanmar's information ministry said Yeo had arrived in Yangon and
will travel Tuesday to the new administrative capital Naypyidaw
to meet with senior officials.


Neither the ministry nor the embassy would provide further
details on the trip.


Myanmar's Prime Minister Soe Win has been hospitalised in
Singapore for more than two weeks.


The junta insists that he is in good health and is merely there
for medical checks, but exiled dissidents believe Soe Win's
health could be fading.


The junta leader, Senior General Than Shwe, also spent nearly two
weeks in Singapore for medical checks in January.


Over the last three months, several firms in Singapore have
signed contracts to search for natural gas in Myanmar waters.


However opponents to the regime have condemned the deals for
throwing a monetary lifeline to the junta by reducing the effect
of western sanctions on the military.
