Tickets for Euro 2008 matches that went on sale in March will be
distributed by lottery after fans ordered 30 times more than are
available, organisers revealed Monday.


The demand for 10.36 million tickets was 18 times higher than for
the previous European championship finals in Portugal in 2004 and
nearly matched last year's World Cup in Germany.


Some 588,716 people from 142 countries placed orders for next
year's finals in Austria and Switzerland by the deadline of March
31, organisers said in a statement. All matches were
oversubscribed.


About 346,000 tickets were available in the Internet sale.


The random lottery will be held in mid-April under the
supervision of legal officials, after each application is
checked.


The last chance to find a seat will be early next year, when
another 399,000 tickets will be sold through the national
associations of the 16 teams that eventually qualify for the
finals.
