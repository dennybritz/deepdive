France's TGV fast train is to make a bid to beat its own world
speed record Tuesday, amid reports that in recent unofficial
tests it reached nearly 570 kilometres (354 miles) per hour.


Weather conditions permitting, a TGV train will be driven during
the afternoon along a stretch of the new high-speed line built
between Paris and the eastern city of Strasbourg.


"Tuesday is the official day. There will be monitors in place,
and we'll see what speed we can hit," said a representative of
the state rail company SNCF.


On Saturday Le Parisien newspaper reported that in a recent trial
a TGV train travelled at 568 kilometres per hour (kph) -- well in
excess of the 513.3 kph record which was set by a TGV train in
1990.
