EU trade chief Peter Mandelson welcomed on Monday a free-trade
agreement between the United States and South Korea, which he
said increased the chances of a deal between Brussels and Seoul.


After 10 months of tough negotiations, the United States and
South Korea reached a free trade agreement in the eleventh hour
which scraps tariffs on a broad range of industrial items.


"Such an agreement will give further momentum to global trade
liberalisation," the EU trade commissioner said in a statement.


"This success strengthens the prospects for the planned EU-Korea
(free-trade agreement) talks due to start next month," he added.


The European Commission is aiming to get a mandate from EU member
states to start talks with Seoul on reaching a free-trade
agreement.


The US-SKorea agreement will eliminate nearly 90 percent of each
side's tariffs on industrial goods immediately, with the
remainder phased out over three to 15 years.


On agriculture however, South Korea won a battle to exclude its
politically sensitive rice crop while the US gained greater
access for its beef exports.
