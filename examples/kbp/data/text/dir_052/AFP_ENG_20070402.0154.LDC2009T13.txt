A suicide bomber blew up a truck near a primary school and police
station in Iraq's northern oil city of Kirkuk on Monday, killing
12 people, including a baby, police officials said.


Another 178 people were wounded in the blast that caused
extensive damage at a time when US troops were apparently
visiting the police station, Kirkuk district police commander
Major General Torhan Yussef Abdul Rahman said.


Among the 12 people killed in the explosion was a policeman, he
added. Police and a hospital doctor said earlier that a baby was
also killed.


Many of the wounded were pupils at the nearby school and local
residents, after the suicide bomber blew up the truck outside the
criminal investigations department in the north Kirkuk district
of Rahimawa, Rahman said.


Ambulances in the city used loudspeakers to call on people to go
to hospitals to donate blood following the attack, an AFP
correspondent reported.


Rahman said the explosion caused extensive damage, but the area
was sealed off by police, with officers barring journalists from
viewing the bomb site.


Separately, a roadside bomb targeting a police patrol in south
Kirkuk wounded five policeman, police said.


Insurgent attacks are common in Kirkuk, which sits atop a third
of the country's oil resources and is home to a fractious ethnic
and sectarian mix.


Longstanding Kurdish demands for the city to be incorporated into
their autonomous region in northern Iraq are due to be put to a
referendum before the end of the year.
