The northern German town of Bad Doberan will on Monday strip
Adolf Hitler of his honorary citizenship just over two months
before hosting the next G8 summit, the mayor said.


"We are meeting tonight and one can assume that we will settle
this matter. It is a political formality," mayor Hartmut Polzin
told AFP.


Bad Doberan, which used to be part of communist East Germany, is
one of several thousand German towns and cities that awarded the
Fuehrer the honour during Nazi times.


But unlike most of the rest, Bad Doberan failed to revoke his
honorary citizenship after 1945.


The Baltic Sea resort counts as one of its districts
Heiligendamm, where Chancellor Angela Merkel will host her fellow
leaders of the G8 club of wealthy nations for a summit on June
6-8.


Germany is the current G8 president.
