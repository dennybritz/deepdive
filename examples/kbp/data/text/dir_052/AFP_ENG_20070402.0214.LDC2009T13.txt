South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun Monday urged his Austrian
counterpart Heinz Fischer to encourage businesses from the
European state to invest more here during their talks.


Roh said in a joint news conference with Fischer that Austrian
firms wishing to invest in Asia should consider South Korea as
their first choice, a view echoed by Fischer.


"Our Korean economy is currently in a very good situation. It is
very stable, growing at an appropriate rate," Roh said.


Roh's request came hours after a US-South Korean free trade pact
was announced. He said Seoul would push for a similar pact with
the European Union during the first half of this year.


Both presidents expressed hope for strengthening ties and
expanding cooperation between the two countries on various
fronts, including economy and business.


The two leaders said they also discussed their countries'
competing efforts to host the 2014 Winter Olympics.


Fischer arrived Sunday for a four-day state visit, the first
Austrian head of state to visit South Korea since diplomatic ties
were established in 1963.


The Austrian president, accompanied by some 50 business leaders,
visited a Samsung Electronics plant on the southern outskirs of
Seoul. They plan to tour the inter-Korean border village of
Panmunjom and meet local business leaders.
