Northampton's France winger Matthieu Bourret has agreed a three-
year deal with French top flight rugby side Castres.


Bourret, winner of the World Under-20 Rugby Championship title
with France in 2006, arrived at the English side last November to
fill in for the injured Bruce Reihana and Jon Clarke.


The 21-year-old will join Castres at the end of this season.


Bourret previously played for French side Perpignan.
