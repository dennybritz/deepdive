French stock market regulators are analysing share price
movements in companies which have recently been the object of
rumours, but have not launched a formal enquiry, a spokesman said
on Monday.


"It is premature to speak of an inquiry," the spokesman for the
AMF bourse watchdog watch said.


The Financial Times reported on Monday that France Telecom has
asked stock market regulator AMF to investigate a sudden three
percent percent drop in its share price last Tuesday, after false
rumours circulated that it would abandon performance objectives
set three weeks earlier.


The shares recovered to end the day barely unchanged after the
group reconfirmed the targets.


The regulators' spokesman did not confirm the list of companies
mentioned in the press report and said its analysis was based "on
volumes and unusual trade," rather than on "rumours for which we
have no source".


The Paris stock exchange dropped slightly ib Monday with the CAC
40 index of leading shares shedding a slight 0.06 percent in
midday trade.


The Financial Times said the AMF was also understood to have
launched preliminary investigations into dealing of shares in
Carrefour, Vinci, Eiffage, Valeo and Atos Origin.
