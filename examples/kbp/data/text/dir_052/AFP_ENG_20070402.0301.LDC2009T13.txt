FIFA president Sepp Blatter will be unchallenged when he stands
for re-election on May 31, world football's governing body said
Monday.


No other candidate had come forward by the March 31 deadline for
the election during the FIFA Congress in Zurich, FIFA announced
in a statement.


Sixty-six out of world football's 207 national associations have
nominated Blatter for his third term at the helm of FIFA.


"Over the past nine years, I have managed to overcome a range of
difficulties and bring about several improvements thanks to their
help and to the support of other members of the global football
family," the 71 year-old said.


"During my third period of office, football will acquire a more
pronounced and extensive social role," he added.


The Swiss lawyer was FIFA General Secretary under the wing of
Joao Havelange until he was elected president for the first time
in 1998 when the Brazilian retired.


Blatter's re-election in 2002 for what became a five-year period
was marked by an acrid battle with African confederation chief
Issa Hayatou, as critics raised allegations of financial
impropriety or mismanagement at FIFA headquarters.


Blatter has firmly denied any wrongdoing and underlined the
health of the governing body's finances under his stewardship in
recent years.
