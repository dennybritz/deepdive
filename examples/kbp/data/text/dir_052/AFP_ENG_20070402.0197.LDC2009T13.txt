Palestinian information minister Mustafa Barghuti met Monday with
Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema, the Italian ministry
said.


The meeting -- as well as a meeting by Palestinian foreign
minister Ziad Abu Amr with his French counterpart in Paris, also
on Monday -- will be the first in European Union member states by
ministers of the unity government formed by the Palestinians in
March 2006.


The Barghuti-D'Alema meeting lasted about 45 minutes, the Italian
foreign ministry said, adding only that the two men had met
before.


Barghuti and Abu Amr are members of a new cabinet formed in March
that unites the radical Hamas Islamist movement with moderates in
the hope that the West will lift an aid and diplomatic embargo.


German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday that the European
Union would not have contacts with government ministers who
refuse to renounce violence and recognise Israel.


Many Western powers have eased their boycott by agreeing to meet
non-Hamas ministers, but have so far refused to resume direct aid
to the Palestinian Authority.
