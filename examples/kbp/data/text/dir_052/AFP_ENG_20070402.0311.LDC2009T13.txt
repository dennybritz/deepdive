European Union representatives met Uzbek officials here Monday, a
diplomat said, as the EU readies to rule on sanctions imposed on
the country after the bloody repression of the 2005 Andijan
uprising.


The German embassy in Tashkent, speaking for the current German
presidency of the EU, confirmed that talks were taking place but
did not give further details. Uzbek authorities were also not
able to provide more information.


EU sanctions, including a visa ban on top officials, were imposed
after the repression of an armed uprising and a peaceful protest
in the eastern city of Andijan nearly two years ago by Uzbek
security forces.


Brussels is due to decide in May whether to continue the
sanctions.


Non-governmental organisations and journalists who witnessed the
crackdown said between 500 and 1,000 people died, including many
civilians. Uzbek authorities only recognise 187 victims, mainly
said to be "terrorists" and members of the security forces.


The European Union has called for an independent inquiry into the
crackdown in return for lifting the sanctions but Tashkent has so
far rejected this proposal.
