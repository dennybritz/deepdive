Britain reacted Monday to claims from Tehran that all 15 British
naval personnel held in Iran have confessed to trespassing by
insisting again that they were seized in Iraqi territorial
waters.


"We can only reiterate our position," a Foreign Office spokesman
said.


"They've been detained against their will, we have not had
consular access, we have made it quite clear they were seized in
Iraqi waters, and we want them released," the spokesman said.


In Tehran, state television reported that all 15 British sailors
and marines detained by Iran late last month in the northern Gulf
have now "confessed" to illegally entering its territorial
waters.


The report comes after Iranian television earlier broadcast new
pictures of two captured British naval personnel admitting to
illegally entering its waters, prompting the Foreign Office to
denounce the footage as "unacceptable."
