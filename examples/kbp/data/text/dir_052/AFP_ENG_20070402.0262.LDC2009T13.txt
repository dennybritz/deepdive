Top defence officials from nuclear-armed south Asian rivals
Pakistan and India are to meet later this week for talks on
possible troop cuts at the world's highest frontline, an official
said Monday.


An Indian defence ministry spokesman said the defence secretaries
of the two countries would meet on Friday and Saturday, most
likely in Islamabad, for fresh discussions on the 6,300-metre
(20,800-feet) Siachen glacier.


Thousands of Indian and Pakistani soldiers are posted on the
Siachen glacier -- situated in northern Kashmir close to the
Chinese border -- where altitude, icy temperatures and accidents
have claimed more lives than enemy fire.


The two side fought regular artillery duels in the region until
November 2003, when a ceasefire was agreed along the heavily-
militarised Line of Control in Kashmir.


Analysts say Siachen is of little strategic value, but the Indian
army -- which has occupied most of the high-altitude battlefield
since 1987 -- wants existing troop positions marked out to
dissuade Pakistan from moving its soldiers forward in the event
of a pull-out.


Pakistan, which claims all of Kashmir, fears that drawing down
its positions would be tacit acceptance of India's claims to
Siachen and the area as a whole.


The dispute over Kashmir has been the trigger for two of the
three wars between India and Pakistan.
