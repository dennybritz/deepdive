A tour guide lost his temper and slashed 20 people with a knife,
including 15 tourists, in China's scenic southwestern town of
Lijiang, state media reported on Monday.


Two of the victims, boys aged seven and 15, were seriously hurt
in Sunday's attack by Xu Minchao, Xinhua news agency said.


Police said Xu was accompanying a 40-member group from China's
northeastern province of Jilin when he got into an argument with
a local guide.


Xu, 25, pulled out a knife at a roadside souvenir shop and began
stabbing and slashing at people in the street, Xinhua reported.


It said he was arrested at the scene and was being interrogated.


The report gave no details on Xu's possible motives, but said
police were investigating whether he had a history of mental
illness.


The injured tourists were all from other parts of China.


The 15-year-old victim, a tourist from eastern China, remained in
critical condition with brain injuries while the seven-year-old,
a local resident, was in a stable condition with a wound to a
neck artery, Xinhua said.


A UN World Heritage Site, Lijiang draws tourists from China and
around the world to its historic cobblestoned "old town" district
and dramatic mountain scenery.
