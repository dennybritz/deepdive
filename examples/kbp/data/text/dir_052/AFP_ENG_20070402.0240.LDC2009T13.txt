Twelve Indonesian Christians went on trial  here Monday charged
with slitting the throat of a Muslim and beating another to death
in the religiously divided region of Poso.


Prosecutors told a court in the capital Jakarta that the
Christians dragged the two fish traders from a truck in Poso on
Sulawesi island before murdering them.


The 12 Christians had set up roadblocks in Poso in September last
year, hours after three Christian militants had been executed for
killing Muslims during earlier bloody unrest in the district, the
court heard.


"Because of the defendants' actions, Poso was again hit by
unrest, the population felt terrorised and road users no longer
dared to use the trans- Sulawesi highway because they feared the
roadblocks," a prosecutor said.


The fish traders were buried on a nearby mountain and their truck
pushed into a ravine, but their bodies were discovered two days
later.


Last year's execution of the Christian militants triggered anger
and violence in Christian pockets of Indonesia, the world's
largest Muslim nation.


Muslims and Christians live in roughly equal number in Poso and
have clashed often. Unrest there in 2000 and 2001 led to about
1,000 deaths and violence has flared periodically since then.


Witnesses will testify at the trial when it resumes in one week's
time.


Five other Christians will appear Wednesday in a separate trial
linked to religious violence.
