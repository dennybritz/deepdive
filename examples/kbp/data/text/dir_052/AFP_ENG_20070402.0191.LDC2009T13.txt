International journalists have added their names to a
300-signature petition demanding the immediate release of BBC
correspondent Alan Johnston who was abducted in the Gaza Strip
three weeks ago.


"We, the undersigned, demand the immediate release of BBC Gaza
correspondent, Alan Johnston," read the petition published in The
Guardian newspaper.


Among the signatories are David Frost, a top British interviewer
who worked for the BBC but now works for the English service of
Qatar-based Al-Jazeera television, as well as Christiane
Amanpour, of the US broadcaster CNN.


"It's now been twenty-one days since Alan was abducted, and we
still have not received firm word about his whereabouts or his
condition," the petition read.


"Alan has worked in Gaza for three years -- he decided to live in
the area as he felt it was the only way to tell the story of the
people of Gaza," it said. "We ask again that everyone with
influence on this situation increase their efforts, to ensure
that Alan is freed quickly and unharmed."


Johnston on Monday marked three weeks in captivity after being
abducted by armed men in Gaza, the longest a foreigner has been
held in the increasingly lawless territory.


Palestinian and foreign journalists held a rally in the West Bank
city of Ramallah in solidarity with the reporter, who was forced
at gunpoint from his car as he drove home from work in Gaza City
on March 12.
