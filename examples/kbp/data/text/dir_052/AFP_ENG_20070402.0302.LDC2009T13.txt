Music giant EMI said Monday it would offer its vast music
catalogue, including pop stars Coldplay and Madonna, for download
without copy protection, allowing consumers to transfer songs
between digital players.


Under the deal announced with US iPod maker Apple, EMI will make
its entire digital repertoire available at a much higher sound
quality than before and without the "digital rights management"
(DRM) software used to combat piracy.


As well preventing piracy, DRM technology restricts how people
can copy the music they legally buy from online stores, including
the transfer of songs from computers to MP3 players and mobile
phones.


The anomalies have led to calls for the software to be scrapped,
most notably from Apple chief executive Steve Jobs.


"Selling digital music DRM-free is the right step forward for the
music industry," Jobs said at a press conference in London on
Monday.


EMI, the world's third-biggest music group, added in its
statement that the decision had been made in response to consumer
demand for high quality digital music that can be used across all
music players.
