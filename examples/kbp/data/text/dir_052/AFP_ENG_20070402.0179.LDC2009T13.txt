Football legend Diego Maradona is showing signs of improvement
four days after being rushed to hospital suffering from liver
problems related to excessive alcohol consumption, doctors said.


"Routine examinations show a favourable evolution compared to the
previous days," Maradona's personal physician Alfredo Cahe and
hospital director Hector Pezzella said in a joint statement
issued Sunday night.


"He has to break the habit of drinking alcohol," Cahe added.


The former Argentine captain will spend a further week in
hospital here and if he is in agreement will continue his
convalescence in Switzerland.


Maradona, 46, has been called one of the greatest players of the
last century but his career on and off the pitch has been marred
by repeated drug and alcohol abuse. He retired from professional
football in 1997.
