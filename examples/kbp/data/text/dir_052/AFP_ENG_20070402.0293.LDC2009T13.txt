The Palestinian government must make "more gestures," including
freeing an Israeli soldier captured in the Gaza Strip, before the
international community can resume aid, France's foreign minister
said Monday.


Philippe Douste-Blazy made the statement after meeting with his
Palestinian counterpart Ziad Abu Amr, who is in Paris on his
first visit to a European capital since a Palestinian unity
cabinet was sworn in two weeks ago.


The international community froze aid and contacts with the
Palestinian government in March 2006 when the hardline Islamist
Hamas movement, which won democratic elections, took power and
refused to recognize Israel.
