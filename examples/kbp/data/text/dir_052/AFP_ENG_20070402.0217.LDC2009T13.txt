Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will lead a delegation of
ministers and lawmakers to Japan and South Korea next week to
sign economic agreements, a Shiite MP said on Monday.


"The prime minister will sign trade pacts in the oil and
electricity sectors, as well as signing a loan agreement with
Japan," Sami al-Askari, a lawmaker considered close to the prime
minister, told AFP.


Maliki will visit the two countries from April 8 to 13, he said,
in what will be the embattled prime minister's first Asian tour
since taking office.


Tokyo, which like Seoul, has troops in war-torn Iraq in support
of US-led forces, recently decided to extend an air force mission
by two years.


The Japanese mission flies people and supplies into Iraq on
behalf of the US-led forces and the United Nations.


But Japan last year withdrew its ground forces from Iraq
following a reconstruction mission that marked the first time
since World War II that Japan had sent troops to a country where
fighting was underway.


Despite the troop withdrawal, Japan maintained the air force
mission, which includes some 210 personnel based in Kuwait.


South Korea has 2,300 troops in Iraq but has said it will
withdraw them by the end of 2007.


In 2004, Seoul sent around 3,500 troops to Iraq, the third
largest foreign contingent after the United States and Britain.
The size of the force has been progressively cut amid domestic
opposition to the deployment.
