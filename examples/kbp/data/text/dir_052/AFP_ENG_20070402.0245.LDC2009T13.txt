Gunmen in Nigeria's southern Bayelsa State on Monday kidnapped
two Lebanese nationals, two days after a British oil worker was
seized from an offshire rig, national police spokesman Haz Iwendi
said.


"It is true that the two Lebanese nationals were kidnapped this
morning in Bayelsa State," Iwendi told AFP by telephone without
giving details.


Industry sources told AFP that the foreigners, who were working
for Setraco, a construction firm, were abducted around 7:00 a.m.
(0600 GMT) in Yenagoa, the state capital.


The identities of the Lebanese and the circumstances surrounding
their kidnap are still unknown.


The abduction took place barely 48 hours after a British oil
worker was kidnapped from an offshore rig in the western Niger
Delta, which was also the target of a raid last year.


There has been no news of him or claim of responsibility for his
kidnap.


Setraco (Nigeria) Limited was established 30 years ago as an
engineering construction company specialising in building
highways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
