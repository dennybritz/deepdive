The French oil group Total reported Monday two additional oil
discoveries on the Moho-Bilondo tract that belongs to the
Republic of the Congo, and is evaluating their production
potential.


Total holds a 53.5 percent stake in the tract, while US oil major
Chevron has 31.5 percent and Societe Nationale des Petroles du
Congo has 15 percent.


The field is located around 80 kilometres (50 miles) off the
Congolese coast at a water depth of 1,000 metres (3,300 feet).


"Appraisal of the additional reserves contained in the three oil
reservoirs encountered by Moho Nord Marine-1 and Moho Nord
Marine-2 is underway to determine their potential," a Total
statement said.


Oil production from earlier discoveries on the tract are to begin
next year and were expected to reach 90,000 barrels per day, it
added.
