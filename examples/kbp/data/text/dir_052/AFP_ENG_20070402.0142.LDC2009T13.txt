The French industrial group Alstom and Atomenergomash of Russia
agreed Monday to establish a joint venture to build turbines and
nuclear reactors, Alstom said in a statement.


Atomenergomash is to own 51 percent of the new group, while
Alstom will hold the remaining 49 percent, with each investing
200 million euros (270 million dollars) in the venture, it added.


"The joint-venture company will focus on the promising nuclear
power plant market in Russia but will also be in a position to
bid on power plant projects abroad using Russian nuclear
technology," the statement said.


Alstom would contribute its "Arabelle" half-speed turbine
technology to the venture, which is to be located in Podolsk,
close to Moscow, it added.


Atomenergomash is a subsidiary of Atomenergoprom, the state-owned
company in charge of producing equipment for Russia's civil
nuclear programme.
