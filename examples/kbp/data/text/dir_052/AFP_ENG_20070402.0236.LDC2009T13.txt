Former England captain Jason Robinson announced Monday he will
retire from club rugby at the end of the season but will be
available for the World Cup if selected.


The 32-year-old Sale skipper will play his last game for his club
at home to Bath on April 13.


"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Sale Sharks but the time
has come to move on to other things," said the winger.


"I want my last game for Sale Sharks to be a home game (v Bath)
and want to be able to say a big thank you to the supporters of
this great club."


Robinson, who has won 43 caps and scored 26 Test tries, will be
available for England throughout this summer and for the World
Cup in September and October.


If selected for England's World Cup defence in France, he intends
retiring from the sport completely after that tournament is over.
