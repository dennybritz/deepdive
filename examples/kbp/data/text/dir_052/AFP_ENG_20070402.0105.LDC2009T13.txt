Convicted drug dealer Siriporn Taweesuk will fight in a prison
bout this week for a world boxing title that could win her early
parole, the Thai corrections department said Monday.


Siriporn, who goes by the nickname "Samson," will fight Japan's
Ayaka Miyano for the vacant World Boxing Council female light
flyweight on Tuesday at a prison outside Bangkok, Thailand's
prison boss Nathee Chitsawang said.


She is currently serving a 10-year sentence for selling small
amounts of narcotics, with more than one year left in prison.


But Nathee said that if she wins, she could be granted early
parole so that she can defend the title in overseas fights.


"If she wins and she has to defend her title abroad, she will be
given parole," Nathee said.


She could qualify for parole anyway, because she has served more
than two-thirds of her sentence and has a record of good
behaviour in prison, he added.


Nathee said he believed that if Siriporn wins, she would be the
first inmate in the world to win a title from prison.


This is the third year in a row that the Thai corrections
department and the WBC have organised prison bouts in Bangkok.


Last year Siriporn Sor Siriporn, known as "Black Rose," lost her
fight to Japanese champion Nanako Kikuchi in May, and with it a
chance to cut short her sentence.
