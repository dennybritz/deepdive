A suicide bomber blew up a truck near a primary school and police
station in Iraq's northern oil city of Kirkuk on Monday, killing
seven people, including a baby, a police commander said.


More than 60 other people were wounded, Kirkuk police chief
Brigadier General Burhan Habib Tayeb told AFP.


Doctor Abdullah Mahmud of Kirkuk General Hospital said that many
of the wounded brought in for treatment were pupils at the nearby
school, after the explosion ripped through the street in the
north Kirkuk district of Rahimawa.


One policeman was among the dead but the rest were civilian
bystanders, the doctor and police chief both said.


Ambulances in the city used loudspeakers to call on people to go
to hospitals to donate blood following the attack, an AFP
correspondent reported.


The suicide bomber blew up the truck outside the local police
criminal investigations department.


Separately, a roadside bomb targeting a police patrol in south
Kirkuk wounded five policeman, Tayeb said.


Insurgent attacks are common in Kirkuk, which sits atop a third
of the country's oil resources and is home to a fractious ethnic
and sectarian mix.


Longstanding Kurdish demands for the city to be incorporated into
their autonomous region in northern Iraq are due to be put to a
referendum before the end of the year.
