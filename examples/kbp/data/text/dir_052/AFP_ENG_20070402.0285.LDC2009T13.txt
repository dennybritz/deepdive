A Yemeni man was sentenced to three years and two months in
prison on Monday for planning to blow up barriers on the northern
border with Saudi Arabia.


Ahmed al-Jalal was found in possession of 12 blocks of TNT
explosives and detonators which he planned to use to destroy the
barriers in the province of Saada, a Sanaa anti-terrorism court
heard.


Government forces have been tackling a tribal revolt in northern
Yemen as well as Al-Qaeda-inspired violence.
