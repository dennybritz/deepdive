German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Beirut on Monday for
talks with rival Lebanese leaders on the deep political crisis in
the country.


Merkel, whose country is currently EU president, is expected to
reiterate her full support for the Western-backed government of
Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, which is locked in a standoff with
the pro-Syrian opposition.


In addition to meeting Siniora, she will also hold talks with
parliament speaker and opposition stalwart Nabih Berri but not
with Damascus-backed President Emile Lahoud who is boycotted by
the EU.


Merkel also plans to visit one of the German ships taking part in
the UN peacekeeping force which was reinforced after last year's
devastating war between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite militant
group Hezbollah.


She arrived in Beirut shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Democrat
speaker of the US House of Representatives, who has angered the
White House because of her plans to visit Syria during her Middle
East tour.
