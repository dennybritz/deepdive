Talks between Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and
parliament leaders got underway in Kiev on Monday as the threat
of a dissolution of parliament and early elections loomed.


"The negotiations began at 2:10 pm local time (1110 GMT)," with
the speaker of parliament and leaders of parliamentary factions
taking part, an official from the presidency's press office told
AFP.


Yushchenko has accused the pro-Russian majority in parliament of
breaking constitutional rules by seeking to persuade pro-Western
lawmakers to join its ranks and has threatened to call early
elections.


Several thousand supporters of the governing coalition, which is
led by Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, rallied in central Kiev
against a possible dissolution of parliament.
