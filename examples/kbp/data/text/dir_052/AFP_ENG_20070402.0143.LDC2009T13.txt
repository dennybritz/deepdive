Gunmen kidnapped and killed 21 Shiite workers on their way home
from Baghdad to the restive province of Diyala to its north,
officials and a medic said Monday.


The workers, employed in Baghdad's popular Shorja market, were
abducted on Sunday as they headed home after work by gunmen who
ambushed their minibus and took them away to an unknown
destination.


On Monday, their handcuffed and blindfolded bodies were found
near a water treatment plant in Morariyah village in Diyala, the
second most dangerous province in Iraq after Baghdad itself.


"There were six more workers who were kidnapped and are still
missing," an official told AFP by telephone from Diyala.


He said the Shiites were from Jaizan al-Imam village and were
seized near an area called Ghalibiyah, north of Baghdad.


Dozens of people are kidnapped every week by armed gangs from
Iraq's rival Shiite and Sunni communities.
