Billionaire Sam Zell will buy media giant Tribune Co. and take
the company private in a 13-billion-dollar deal, the company
announced Monday.


Zell, a Chicago real estate developer, won the bidding after
months of negotiations, besting a reported offer from Los
Angeles-based billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad.


The deal calls for Zell to contribute 315 million dollars of an
8.1 billion dollar purchase price, amounting to 34 dollars per
share. An employee stock ownership plan, financed through new
debt, will provide the rest of the cash and five billion in
existing debt will remain.


Zell will take over the group owning the Chicago Tribune and Los
Angeles Times at a time when traditional media have been
struggling in the face of new technology.


The report said terms of the deal were to be announced later
Monday.


Earlier reports, including in the Chicago Tribune itself, said
Zell was bidding 13 billion dollars for the group and was

A deal would mark a further shakeup of the media industry
struggling to keep up with changing technology.


Tribune Co. also owns the New York daily Newsday, The Baltimore
Sun, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Orlando Sentinel and Hartford
Courant as well as 23 television stations and the Chicago Cubs
baseball team.


The statement said the company would sell the baseball club at
the end of the 2007 season.
