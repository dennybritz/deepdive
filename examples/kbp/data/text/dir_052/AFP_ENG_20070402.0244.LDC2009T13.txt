Newcastle are planning to increase the capacity of St James' Park
to more than 60,000 as part of a proposed 300 million pounds (593
million dollar) development scheme, the English Premiership club
revealed Monday.


The St James' Park project, which is yet to be submitted to
planning chiefs, is a three-phase programme which would see a
major conference centre, hotels and luxury apartments built at
the ground.


Funding for the development would come from outside the club.


Chairman Freddy Shepherd said: "What we are proposing is
something not just for the football club, but for the whole city
and the people of Newcastle.


"Having a conference centre would allow Newcastle to attract top
events in all fields, and the whole project will stand as a
monument to the vibrant development of the city in the new
millennium."
