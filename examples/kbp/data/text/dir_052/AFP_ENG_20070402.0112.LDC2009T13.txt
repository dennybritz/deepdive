A number of big institutional investors are turning up the
pressure on German-US auto giant DaimlerChrysler to sell its
troubled US unit Chrysler, the business daily Handelsblatt
reported on Monday.


Among the investors, the powerful Union Investment fund and SEB,
are to demand from DaimlerChrysler chief Dieter Zetsche at the
car maker's annual general meeting this week a clear commitment
to sell the loss-making unit.


"Under the current conditions, we believe it would make sense to
spin-off Chrysler, since the market environment in the US will
prove to be very difficult in the future," Union Investment fund
manager Ingo Speich told the newspaper.


Handelsblatt also quoted SEB fund manager Juergen Meyer, as
saying that a sell- off was the "preferred scenario".


Officially, DaimlerChrysler has said it is examining "all
strategic options" for Chrysler, but nothing has been officially
decided yet.
