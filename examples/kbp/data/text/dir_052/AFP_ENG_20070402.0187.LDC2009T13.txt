Chinese telecom giant China Netcom Group (Hong Kong) Monday said
its 2006 net profit fell 6.7 percent to 12.96 billion yuan (1.6
billion US dollars) as its fixed-line services came under
pressure from mobile service providers.


Chairman Zhang Chunjiang said the acceleration of mobile
substitution "created severe imbalances in the competitive
landscape" and put pressure on the company's performance last
year.


"Our traditional fixed-line business faced acute challenges," he
said.


The result compared with 13.89 billion yuan notched-up a year ago
while revenue growth was flat, with total sales growing by a
marginal 1.23 percent to 86.92 billion yuan from 85.86 billion
yuan a year earlier.


"In 2006, our strategic response to the acceleration of mobile
substitution was to leverage our extensive network resources and
the multi-business nature of our business to develop bundled and
converged services," he said.
