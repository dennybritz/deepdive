Dozens of Greek human rights groups joined forces this weekend to
stop 41 illegal Iraqi immigrants they say were beaten by police
from being deported.


Twenty-six NGOs are protesting against attempts to send the
Iraqis back to Turkey, the transit point from where they arrived
in Greece 40 days ago, claiming police beat some of them and
ignored their pleas for asylum.


The Iraqis were transferred to Salonika in northern Greece on
Friday.


"Nine Iraqis were beaten while the police tried to force them on
to a bus heading for the Turkish border," the immigrants' lawyer,
Efi Telli, told AFP.


The Greek Helsinki Monitor said police finally agreed to hear
their demands on Saturday but said they were not given a
translator and were refused a medical examination to see if they
had been abused.


Salonika police chief Christos Nikolopoulos said: "The immigrants
did not suffer any ill-treatment but the accusations will be
investigated."
