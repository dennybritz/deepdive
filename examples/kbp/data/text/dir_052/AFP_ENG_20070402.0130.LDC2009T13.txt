The stock market flotation of fixed telecom network operator
Versatel is likely to be one of the biggest in German this year
and raise at least 800 million euros (one billion dollars), the
Financial Times Deutschland reported on Monday.


The money raised from the initial public offering (IPO) would be
divided between Versatel's current owners, British private equity
group Apax Partners, and the company itself, the newspaper said,
quoting information provided by lead managers JP Morgan and
Credit Suisse.


Apax currently holds a 96-percent stake in Versatel, the fourth-
biggest fixed network operator in Germany behind Deutsche
Telekom, Acror and Hansenet.


Versatel chief Peer Knauer has earmarked around one third of
total funds raised in acquisitions and investment, and the rest
in debt reduction, FT Deutschland said.


Versatel currently has around 768 million euros in outstanding
liabilites, more than 3.5 times operating profit of 211.8 million
euros.


"Debt of around double operating profit is appropriate. Cutting
debt is important because it would increase our flexibility for
further acquisitions," Knauer told the newspaper.
