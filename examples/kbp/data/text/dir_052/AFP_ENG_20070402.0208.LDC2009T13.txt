A Dutch businessman convicted for having supplied chemicals used
in gas attacks on Kurds in Iraq in the 1980s began his appeal at
The Hague on Monday, the court told AFP.


Frans van Anraat, 65, was sentenced in December 2005 to 15 years
in jail for complicity in war crimes.


He had supplied chemicals to former Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein's regime between 1985 and 1989 which were used to make
weapons.


These weapons were used most notably in the massacre of 5,000
Kurds in one day in 1988 at Halabja, in north-west Iraq.


The court said Van Anraat could not deny knowing his products
would be used for chemical weapons, although it acquitted him of
complicity in genocide, saying it had not been proven that he
knew of the Iraqi regime's intentions.


Van Anraat and the prosecutor both appealed the ruling.


The businessman is being prosecuted in the Netherlands after the
Dutch supreme court ruled that national courts could try Dutch
residents for genocide and war crimes committed in other
countries.
