Eleven people have been arrested over last year's murder of a
Senegalese student in Saint Petersburg and the case is close to
completion, a Senegalese daily Monday quoted the victim's father
as saying.


Badara Sall said 15 people were initially held for the shooting
of Samba Lampsar Sall in Russia's second city in April 2006, but
four were released because they were minors.


The remaining 11 stayed in custody, he said. The suspected leader
of the gang was killed last year by police who tried to arrest
him.


"I am satisfied with the way the case is being dealt with ... the
investigation is almost complete," Sall told private newspaper
Wal-Fadjri.


He added that the inquiry had been delayed following the
discovery of new evidence, but did not say what that was.


Samba Lampsar Sall, a 28-year-old telecommunications student born
in Moscow to Senegalese parents, was shot in the head as he left
a night club. The weapon, a gun decorated with a swastika, was
recovered nearby.


Five Russian youths were arrested on suspicion of his murder,
which the authorities said was racially motivated.


They were members of an extreme nationalist group called the "Mad
Crowd", suspected of several attacks against foreigners and
Russian citizens from the Caucasus in 2002 and 2003.


The murder was part of a spate of attacks on Africans and
prompted major protests across the city.
