Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called Monday on
South African President Thabo Mbeki to move rapidly to defuse the
escalating political crisis across his northern border.


"It is critical that President Mbeki act quickly and decisively
to halt the suffering of millions of Zimbabweans," Tsvangirai
told journalists.


"There is no time to waste," Tsvangirai added during a visit to
Johannesburg for medical treatment.


Mbeki was appointed last week by fellow southern Africa to act as
a mediator between the Zimbabwean government of President Robert
Mugabe and Tsvangirai's opposition Movement for Democratic
Change.


Mugabe openly acknowledged on Friday that his security forces had
assaulted Tsvangirai and other members of his MDC movement whom
he says are to blame for the political unrest in Zimbabwe.


While the southern African leaders did issue a joint statement of
solidarity with Mugabe's government, they are understood to have
severely criticised him behind closed doors.


Mbeki has come under fire in some quarters for failing to
publicly criticise Mugabe, instead advocating a policy of "quiet
diplomacy".


However Tsvangarai said he welcomed the prospect of regional
involvement in Zimbabwe's problems.


"The MDC is ready to participate fully in a transparent
dialogue," he said.


"The people of Zimbabwe need food and jobs, they need freedom and
help."
