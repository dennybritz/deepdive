Giancarlo Abete was elected as the new president of the Italian
football federation (FIGC) after a general assembly of the clubs
in Italy's top two divisions here on Monday.


The 56-year-old, the only candiate for the presidency and a
former deputy vice- president of the FIGC, takes over from
interim chief Luca Pancalli.


Pancalli, who previously worked as president of the Italian
Paralympic Committee, was appointed extraordinary commisioner of
the FIGC in September 2006.


He was brought in after the resignation of Guido Rossi. Rossi was
hired to restore order after the Italian match-fixing scandal,
which involved Serie A clubs, referees and high-ranked FIGC
officials.


The furore led to the resignation of the then FIGC president
Franco Carraro and vice-president Innocenzo Mazzini.


Pancalli made it clear from the very start that he did not want
the position as FIGC president on a permanent basis.


Italy need a permanent president in place if they are to be
awarded the 2012 European championships, for which they are
short-listed alongside the joint bids of Poland and Ukraine and
Hungary and Croatia.
