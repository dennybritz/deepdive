Hailstones the size of eggs hammered southern parts of China in
storms which killed 13 people and destroyed homes and crops
across thousands of hectares of farmland, officials said Monday.


Seven people died when their bus was caught in a landslide
triggered by the storms in a mountainous area of southwestern
Chongqing region, officials told China's Xinua news agency.


Others were killed by lightning and falling roofs, dislodged by
the hailstorms which have been raging since Sunday, the agency
said, quoting the Chongqing office of disaster relief.


More than one million people were affected in the Chongqing area
and economic losses stood at 198 million yuan, it said.


The storms also caused the collapse of 158 houses and damaged
crops on more than 80,000 hectares of farmland in the region.


Part of an expressway also closed after it became too difficult
for drivers to see, it said.


In Xuanhan region, 20 houses collapsed, more than 1,300 hectares
of farmland were damaged and 23,000 people were affected, the
agency said.


Egg-sized hail started crashing down on Xuanhan early Sunday,
stripping trees of their leaves and breaking open roofs.


Residents of Longquan town, one of the hardest-hit areas, were
still cleaning up after the storms, said Zhang Zhike, a disaster
official who coordinated the relief effort.


Xuanhan county party chief Zhang Lizhong said 10 towns and 87
villages were hit by hailstorms in the area.


On the southeast seaboard, hail pelted areas of Fujian province,
punching holes in thousands of homes, although there were no
casualties, officials said.


Hail also destroyed power supply facilities in Lingkou village in
northern Fujian.
