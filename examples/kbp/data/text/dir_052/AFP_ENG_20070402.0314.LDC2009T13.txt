US shares started higher Monday as a two big takeover deals
boosted sentiment and investors looked for new opportunities on
the first day of the new quarter.


In the opening minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose
19.34 points (0.16 percent) to 12,373.69 and the Nasdaq composite
gained 3.69 points (0.15 percent) to 2,425.33.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index added 1.63 points
(0.11 percent) to 1,422.49.


Sentiment was helped by two big private equity transactions
announced ahead of the market opening.


Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. agreed to
buy credit-card and payments processor First Data in a deal worth
29 billion dollars. Also, billionaire Sam Zell will buy media
giant Tribune Co. and take the company private in a 13-billion-
dollar deal.


Fred Dickson at DA Davidson said there is reason for cautious
optimism.


"We enter the second quarter with a continuing sense of
cautiousness toward the economy, the geopolitical situation in
the Middle East and slowing corporate profit growth," he said.


"The good news is that overall liquidity remains high and the
level of takeover activity remains strong, providing a halo
effect over the entire market."
