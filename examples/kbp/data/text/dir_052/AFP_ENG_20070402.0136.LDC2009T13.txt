A Jordanian military tribunal sentenced an Iraqi and a Libyan to
life imprisonment on Monday after convicting them of an abortive
bomb plot against Amman airport last year on behalf of Al-Qaeda.


A second Iraqi was sentenced to 15 years in prison while a
compatriot was acquitted for lack of evidence, wrapping up a
trial that opened in August.


Two more Iraqis and a Saudi who remain on the run were given life
jail terms in absentia.


The four defendants in court were arrested in March last year
when the authorities seized explosives of the kind used in
suicide attacks on Amman hotels that killed 60 people the
previous November.


They were charged last June with illegal possession of explosives
and conspiracy to carry out a terrorist attack against the
airport.


According to the charge sheet, one of the Iraqi defendants, Saad
Fakhri Yunis al-Nuaimi, testified that one of the fugitives told
him "Al-Qaeda would claim responsibility" for the bombing.


Libyan Mohammed al-Durssi was tasked with staking out the airport
in preparation for the attack, prosecutors said.


The defendants claimed during a hearing in November that their
testimony was given under duress.


They have 30 days to appeal the verdicts.
