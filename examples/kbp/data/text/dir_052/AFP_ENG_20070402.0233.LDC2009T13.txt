Gunmen in Nigeria's southern Bayelsa State on Monday kidnapped
two Lebanese nationals, two days after a British oil worker was
seized from an offshire rig, national police spokesman Haz Iwendi
said.


"It is true that the two Lebanese nationals were kidnapped this
morning in Bayelsa State," Iwendi told AFP by telephone without
giving details.
