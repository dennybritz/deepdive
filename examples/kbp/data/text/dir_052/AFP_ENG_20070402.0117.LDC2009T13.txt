Hong Kong share prices closed flat Monday, giving up early gains
as the Japanese stock market reversed direction and finished
sharply lower, dealers said.


Worries over a standoff between the West and Iran over the
seizure of British military personnel, a rise in oil prices and
uncertainties over the US economy also prompted investors to shed
positions in late trade.


Trade was also cautious ahead of upcoming holidays, which will
see the market closed from Thursday until next Monday.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 8.77 points at 19,809.70.
