Axel Springer, the German newspaper publisher, could invest more
than two billion euros (2.7 billion dollars) in expanding
internationally, the group's chairman Mathias Doepfner told the
Financial Times in an interview Monday.


Doepfner said Springer, which publishes the mass-circulation
daily Bild, could spend something close to the value of the
aborted bid it made for commercial television group ProSiebenSAT1
in 2005 should a "unique opportunity" come along.


"It goes without saying that whenever a large international media
company comes on to the market, we will examine it very closely
-- whether in print, TV or the online sector," the chairman said.


Springer's bid for ProSiebenSAT1, the biggest free-to-air
broadcaster in Germany, was blocked by the competition
authorities.
