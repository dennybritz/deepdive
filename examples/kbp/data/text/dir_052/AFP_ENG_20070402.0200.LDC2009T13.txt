European Union diplomats were meeting with Uzbekistan officials
here on Monday to discuss the sanctions imposed on the country
following the bloody repression of the Andijan uprising in 2005.


The German embassy in Tashkent, speaking for the current German
presidency of the EU, confirmed talks were taking place but did
not give further details, and nor did the Uzbek authorities.


EU sanctions were imposed following the Uzbek army's repression
of an armed uprising and a peaceful demonstration in the eastern
city of Andijan in 2005, and Brussels is due to decide whether to
continue them in May.


NGOs and journalists who witnessed the crackdown said between 500
and 1,000 people died. The Uzbek government only recognises 187
victims, and says they were mainly "terrorists" and militants.


The EU has called for an independent inquiry into the repression
in return for lifting sanctions, which include an arms embargo
and the withholding of visas from top officials, but Tashkent has
rejected this.
