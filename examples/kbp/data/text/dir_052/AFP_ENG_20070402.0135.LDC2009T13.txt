John Billings, founder of the natural contraceptive system known
as the Billings Method, has died in Australia aged 89, his
colleagues said Monday.


Billings was surrounded by family when he died late Sunday after
a short illness, said Marian Corkill, director of the Ovulation
Method Research and Reference Centre of Australia.


The Melbourne-born doctor and his wife Evelyn Billings began work
on their natural family planning system, at first called the
Ovulation Method, in 1953 at the invitation of the Catholic
Marriage Guidance Bureau.


The two doctors spent the next five decades researching and
perfecting the method which now bears their name and is
recognised around the world.


The system ideally allows a woman to determine her ovulation
cycle, and therefore avoid sex when she is most fertile, by
monitoring cervical mucus.


"He changed the understanding of fertility though the work that
he has done," Corkill said.


Colleagues said the Billings Method has also assisted couples,
who had previously been considered to be infertile, to achieve
pregnancy through enhanced understanding of the woman's ovulation
cycle.


"Most notably in the past decade, the Billings Ovulation Method
has been successfully introduced into China, where it is now the
only government-approved method of natural family planning,"
Corkill's centre said in a statement.


Billings is survived by his wife and eight of their nine
children.
