The "stage-managed" appearances of captive British soldiers on
Iranian television will force no change in Britain's demand for
their unconditional release, Prime Minister Tony Blair's
spokesman said Monday.


"The Iranians know our position. They know that stage-managed TV
appearances aren't going to affect that position. They know that
we have strong international support," the official spokesman
told a briefing.


He added that "a lot is going on behind the scenes" to secure the
release of 15 sailors and marines captured by Iran in the
northern Gulf more than a week ago.
