A senior Japanese diplomat expressed pessimism Monday that North
Korea would shut its nuclear facilities by a promised deadline
this month amid an impasse in six-nation talks.


"We should not give up our hopes, but objectively looking at the
situation, I see it is becoming increasingly difficult to
achieve," Shotaro Yachi, vice minister for foreign affairs, told
a regular press conference.


Under a February 13 agreement, North Korea promised to shut down
and seal its plutonium-producing Yongbyon reactor and other
plants by April 14 in exchange for energy aid.


But Pyongyang last month stormed out of talks, which group the
two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, unless it
receives some 25 million dollars of its funds frozen in a Macau
bank.


Japan has taken the hardest line in the talks and refused to
provide any energy aid due to a dispute over North Korea's past
kidnappings of Japanese nationals.


Washington in 2005 blacklisted the money in Macau due to
accusations of money laundering and counterfeiting. It announced
the end of the sanction last month and said it was up to the
Macau authorities to release the cash.


But the funds were not immediately transferred and North Korea
has insisted it will not cooperate further unless it sees the
money.


"It is a technical problem, but it is regrettable that it has not
progressed," Yachi said.


"We hope the issue will soon be taken care of so that we can
start the discussions of issues of substance," he said.
