Five African peacekeepers were killed by gunmen in Sudan's
western region of Darfur, an African Union spokesman told AFP
Monday.


"The AMIS (African Mission in Sudan) protection force soldiers
were attacked by armed men as they guarded a watering point in
Umm Barru in northwest Darfur," Nureddin Mezni said.


The attack near the Chadian border took place late Sunday.


Mezni condemned the killing, deploring the fact that "African
soldiers who came to help restore peace in Darfur should be
targeted in such attacks."


The African Union has some 7,000 troops deployed in Darfur but
the under-funded and ill-equipped contingent has failed to stem
the violence.


Only one of three negotiating rebel groups signed a peace deal
with the Khartoum government in Abuja in May last year. The
agreement made no impact and led rebel factions to splinter,
causing more violence.


According to the United Nations, at least 200,000 people have
died and more than two million fled their homes since the
conflict erupted in February 2003. Some sources say the death
toll is much higher.
