A Saudi found guilty of murder was beheaded by the sword on
Monday in Kharj, south of Riyadh, the interior ministry said.


Shafi bin Mosfer al-Dusari was condemned to death for shooting
dead Moajib bin Juwiad al-Dusari, the ministry said in a
statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.


His execution was the 25th announced by the Saudi authorities so
far this year. On Sunday two policemen were executed in the
capital for murdering a Bangladeshi taxi driver after robbing
him.


Last year at least 37 people were executed, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Executions by beheading are generally carried out in public in
ultra- conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of
sharia or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.


Human Rights Watch, the New York-based human rights watchdog, has
called on Saudi Arabia to halt all executions.
