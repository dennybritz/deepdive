All 15 British sailors and marines detained by Iran late last
month have now "confessed" to illegally entering its territorial
waters, state television reported on Monday.


"All the sailors and marines who were detained by Iran have
confessed that they illegally entered Iranian territorial
waters," said the newsreader on the Arabic-language news bulletin
on Iran's rolling news channel IRINN.


The report gave no further details.


It comes after Iranian television earlier broadcast new pictures
of two captured British naval personnel admitting to illegally
entering its waters, prompting a furious reaction from London.
