Work is to begin on Liverpool's new stadium in Stanley Park after
plans were agreed at a meeting held over the weekend.


New owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, along with club chief
executive Rick Parry, held talks with members of Liverpool City
Council who approved the plan.


Tenders will go out in April with work starting on the
60,000-seater stadium by the end of July, and due to be completed
by the end of 2008.
