World oil prices fell Monday but remained close to seven-month
highs on supply concerns caused by the Britain-Iran crisis and a
kidnapping in Nigeria, Africa's biggest crude producer, traders
said.


In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for May fell 46
cents to 67.64 dollars in electronic trading.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, lost 68 cents to 65.19 dollar in electronic
deals before the official open of the US market.


Iranian state television said Monday that all 15 British sailors
and marines detained by Iran late last month have now "confessed"
to illegally entering its territorial waters. Britain insists the
sailors were in Iraqi waters when captured.


Iran is the world's fourth biggest producer of crude oil and some
analysts believe there is a risk that the Islamic Republic could
move to disrupt its oil exports should the crisis with Britain
escalate.


Last week Brent crude reached 69.14 dollars a barrel -- the
highest level since September 4, 2006 -- on the Iran crisis.


On Monday the market was also tracking events in Nigeria, where a
British oil worker was kidnapped over the weekend, an industry
source said.


A spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office confirmed that London
was aware of an incident in which a British national was
abducted.
