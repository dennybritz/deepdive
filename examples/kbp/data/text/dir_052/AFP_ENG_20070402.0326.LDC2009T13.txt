Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"This was our fourth match in 10 days and you could see that some
of the guys were really flat in the field. Daren Powell has lost
10km in the last few days."


- West Indies skipper Brian Lara after his team slumped to a
third successive defeat


"I have seen quite a lot from Sanath, but I would rank this as
one of the best. He has done it not just against small teams, in
low-key tournaments, but in big tournaments, under pressure.
That's what makes him so special."


- Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene praises Sanath Jayasuriya
after the veteran opener hit his 25th one-day century against the
West Indies.


"They are huge games because when you sit down and make plans for
the rest of the tournament, they are both 'banker' games and,
with games like that, there comes an added pressure."


- South Africa coach Mickey Arthur on the hiden problems of
facing Ireland and Bangladesh.


"I just want to pass on my best wishes and say 'mate you deserve
all the records that cricket offers.' I am relieved that a bowler
of McGrath's calibre has broked my record."


- Pakistan great Wasim Akram paying tribute to Glenn McGrath
after the Australian went past his record of World Cup wickets


"India was a good example a few years ago when we were losing 1-0
in the Test series and the wives arrived and we ended up drawing
the series - they do help when they arrive."


- England coach Duncan Fletcher defending the presence of the
team's wives and girlfriends at the World Cup.
