Siemens hopes to double its sales in China by 2010 from the
current level of five billion euros (6.6 billion dollars), the
head of the German electronic giant's Chinese activities, said on
Monday.


"We are optimistic that, by 2010, we will double the sales of our
regional company in China from their current level of roughly
five billion euros," said Richard Hausmann.


China was facing "major challenges -- rapid economic growth,
increasing urbanisation and major events like the upcoming 2008
Olympic games and Expo 2010 a creating a need for advanced
infrastructure," Hausmann said.


"Our portfolio in China is ideally positioned for providing a
modern, sustainable and environmentally compatible
infrastructure."
