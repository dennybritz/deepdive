Liverpool received a boost ahead of Tuesday's Champions League
quarter-final tie against PSV Eindhoven with striker Craig
Bellamy given the all clear to travel with the squad.


Bellamy missed Liverpool's win over Arsenal at the weekend,
having picked up ankle and rib injuries playing for Wales last
week.


"I got a really hefty knock from the San Marino 'keeper last week
in Cardiff," said Bellamy.


"It still hurts now when I breath but I really hope I will be fit
to play against PSV. This European run is so important to me. I
really want to be involved in what is the best level I have
played at during my career."


Liverpool will monitor Bellamy before deciding Tuesday whether he
will figure against PSV.


Manager Rafael Benitez has no other injury problems with skipper
Steven Gerrard, taken off against Arsenal due to tiredness, also
in the party.


Steve Finnan and Sami Hyypia, rested on Saturday, were also in
the squad. Mohamed Sissoko is suspended for the first leg.
