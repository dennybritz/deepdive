Austria's jobless rate remained unchanged in March from the
previous month at 4.4 percent, the economy and labour ministry
said on Monday.


Some 237,715 people were without jobs compared to 276,652 in
March, the ministry said in a statement.


"The job market is growing superbly, the number of jobless is
falling further... our goal of full employment is within sight,"
Economy and Labour Minister Martin Bartenstein said.


Austria is hoping to achieve an unemployment rate below four
percent by 2010.


Austria's unemployment rate is among the lowest in the European
Union, where the rate averaged 7.4 percent for all 27 EU
countries, according to the latest figures in October.
