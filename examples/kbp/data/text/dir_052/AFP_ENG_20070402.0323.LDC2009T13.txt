US electronics giant Texas Instruments on Monday became the first
major chipmaker to rule out India as the site of a new plant, in
a blow to India's ambitions of becoming a microchip industry hub.


"From TI's point of view, our investment focus in India will
remain on research and product development," said Rich Templeton,
president and chief executive officer of the Dallas-based
company.


Texas Instruments may sub-contract work to chip foundries that
may set up in India, but will not consider the country as a
manufacturing location, Templeton told a news conference in
Bangalore, India's hi-tech hub.


India's main asset is the research and development capability of
local engineers, he said, adding Texas Instruments had a choice
of other locations where it could establish a manufacturing
plant.


Texas Instruments was the first international chipmaker to set up
a research facility in India, in 1985, and its rejection of the
country as a manufacturing base is a setback to government plans
of attracting billions of dollars in investment.


Others, including Intel, AMD, and Toshiba, have been silent.


Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government in February unveiled
incentives including tax breaks, subsidies and interest-free
loans for chimakers to set up factories. The incentives will be
valid for the first 10 years of operations.
