Shares in Telecom Italia and its principle shareholder Pirelli
shot up in early trading here Monday on news of a bid from the US
telecommunications operator AT&T and Mexican counterpart
America Movil.


Pirelli shares gained 9.79 percent to 0.91 euros, while Telecom
Italia added 7.85 percent to 2.30 euros in a market that had
gained 0.38 percent overall.


AT&T, America Movil and Pirelli are in exclusive talks for
the purchase of two thirds of the Italian group's shareholding in
Telecom Italia, Pirelli said.


A deal would be worth 2.7 billion euros (3.6 billion euros) to
the Italian tyre, cable and real estate group, but it quickly
sparked opposition among some Italian politicians.


Pirelli's stake is currently held by its Olimpia unit, which owns
18 percent of the Italian telecoms operator, one of the jewels of
the Italian national economy.


Pirelli owns 80 percent of Olimpia.


The Italian government has shown little enthusiasm for the
transaction however, which could open the door to further foreign
participation in the telecoms sector.


The offer by AT&T and America Movil for Telecom Italia is
valid until April 30 and is based on a price of 2.82 euros per
share minus Olimpia's net debt, Pirelli said.


But a sale is also based on the condition that the Italian groups
Mediobanca and Assicurazioni Generali do not exercise pre-emptive
rights they hold on Olimpia shares.


Should those rights be exercised, ATT and America Movil would be
entitled to compensation of 16 million euros each, Pirelli said.
