Three Estonian political parties signed a coalition agreement
Monday, paving the way for a government nearly one month after
the Baltic state held parliamentary elections, officials said.


The three partners are the Reform Party of outgoing Prime
Minister Andrus Ansip, the Pro Patria-Res Publica -- both right
of centre -- and the left-wing Social- Democratic Party.


The three parties would have a comfortable 60-vote majority in
the 101-seat single-chamber parliament.


"This agreement gives Estonia an excellent government which will
guarantee the continuing development of this country for the
benefit of all," Ansip said after the signing ceremony.


"We have created a governing coalition for Estonia to last four
years," he said.


No government in the Baltic state has yet served a full four-year
term.


Ansip said the coalition government would pursue the pro-business
policies of his outgoing administration, while foreign policy
would focus on the "three main pillars" of membership in the EU
and NATO, as well as strong ties with the United States.


President Toomas Hendrik Ilves is expected to formally nominate
Ansip for prime minister later in the week, after which Ansip
will present his government's programme to parliament.


Ansip, whose Reform Party did best in last month's election, must
then receive the backing of a simple majority in parliament to be
confirmed as head of government.
