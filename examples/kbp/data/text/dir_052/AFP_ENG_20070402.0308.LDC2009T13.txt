Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. will buy
credit-card and payments processor First Data in a deal worth 29
billion dollars, the groups announced Monday.


The deal, one of the heftiest in the latest wave of private
equity transactions, gives shareholders 34 dollars a share, or a
26 percent premium over Friday's share price.


KKR Member Scott Nuttall said First Data "is at the forefront of
the worldwide trend toward electronic payments," and added, "We
believe that through continued investments in its technology,
people and customer relationships, First Data will build on its
history of innovation and industry leadership."


Since its initial public offering in 1992, First Data has grown
from 1.2 billion dollars in annual revenue to 10.6 billion prior
to the spin-off of Western Union and 7.1 billion afterwards.
