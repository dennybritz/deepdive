A woman has won a contested election for the first time to the
only municipal council in the gas-rich Gulf state of Qatar,
according to results from the weekend poll.


Sheikha Yussef al-Jiffri, was among three women out of 118
candidates running for 29 council seats on Sunday in only the
third local election in the emirate, the deputy head of the
electoral commission Khaled bin Jabr al-Thani told AFP.


Jiffri was a member of the outgoing council -- the sole local
government in the tiny country -- but had been returned unopposed
after the other two candidates in her ward stood down in the last
vote in 2003.


This time round she took 90 percent of the vote crushing her two
male rivals, Thani said.


"I hope that the other women candidates will have more success in
the future," he added, reflecting official support for a bigger
role for women in public life.


Jiffri rejected any idea that she had been elected because of her
gender.


"Competence has no sex and was the basis of my election," she
said.


Electoral commission chief Abdel Aziz al-Ansari said overall
turnout in the elections was 51.1 percent of the 28,000
registered voters, revising an earlier figure slightly upwards.


In the last elections, four years ago turnout was only 37.7
percent.


The municipal polls have failed to stir enthusiasm ahead of the
country's first partial legislative election expected later this
year.


Qatar has an indigenous population of 174,000 out of a total of
750,000 inhabitants.
