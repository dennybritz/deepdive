Indian share prices plunged 4.72 percent Monday, the sharpest
fall in nearly a year as bank, auto and housing stocks were sold
off after a central bank interest rate hike, dealers said.


They said concern that the central bank may take more steps to
cool inflation which has stayed above six percent for wholesale
prices in the past month had triggered the selling.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex fell 616.73
points to 12,455.37, it's biggest one-day drop since May 18,
2006.


The drop was sparked by Friday's move by the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) to hike a key short-term lending rate by a quarter of
a percentage point to 7.75 percent and the amount of cash that
banks must hold on deposit -- by half a percentage point -- which
raised concern that credit costs would rise sharply.


"The markets bled, hit by the RBI's rate hike. We feel there is
weakness ahead as investors expect further tightening at the end
of April," said Atul Hatwar, a dealer with brokerage Crosseas
Securities.


Government-owned State Bank of India, the country's largest bank,
fell 62.65 rupees or 6.31 percent to 930.25 while Maruti Udyog,
which accounts for a majority of India's domestic car sales, fell
66.30 rupees or 8.09 percent to 753.40.
