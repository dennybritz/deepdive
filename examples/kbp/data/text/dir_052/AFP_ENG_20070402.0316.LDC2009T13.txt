The toll from floods and avalanches as winter snows melt in
Afghanistan continued to rise Monday with at least 20 more deaths
reported as efforts were under way to reach up to 25,000 affected
people.


The interior ministry said floods over the weekend killed seven
people in the western province of Herat and 10 in central Parwan,
while five more died in an avalanche in central Bamiyan.


The ministry did not have figures for the total toll from days of
heavy rain and melting snows amid media reports of scores more
deaths, with bridges washed away, rivers overflowing, houses
destroyed and livestock killed.


Police in the northeastern province of Nuristan, near the massive
Hindu Kush mountain range, had told AFP Sunday 16 people were
killed in a flash flood.


The United Nations said meanwhile Monday it was involved in a
huge effort under way to reach between 20,000 and 25,000 people
affected by floods and avalanches.


About 350 people were airlifted to safety in Parwan, near the
capital, at the weekend while scores of houses were destroyed in
Bamiyan and Panjshir, where nine people were also believed to
have died, it said.


Some 170 homes were also destroyed in Kabul, where the city's
river overflowed despite efforts to reinforce the barriers, but
swift evacuation meant there had been no casualties.


More flooding was anticipated as the snow continues to melt, the
UN said.
