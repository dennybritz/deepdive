Former England rugby union captain Jason Robinson announced
Monday he will retire from club rugby at the end of the season
but will be available for the World Cup if selected.


The 32-year-old Sale skipper will play his last game for his club
at home to Bath on April 13.


"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Sale Sharks but the time
has come to move on to other things," said the winger.


"I want my last game for Sale Sharks to be a home game and want
to be able to say a big thank you to the supporters of this great
club."


Robinson, who has won 43 caps and scored 26 Test tries, will be
available for England throughout this summer and for the World
Cup in September and October.


If selected for England's World Cup defence in France, he intends
retiring from the sport completely after that tournament is over.


Robinson, who joined Sale from Wigan rugby league club in
November 2000, has made 531 appearances in both codes of the
game.


He helped Sale land their first Premiership title last season.


But the current campaign has been difficult, with Sale currently
ninth in the Premiership table, after being hit by serious
injuries to key players.


Robinson had retired from international rugby in September 2005,
but he made a successful return for this season's Six Nations
Championship, scoring four tries in four appearances.


England travel to South Africa for a two-Test tour in May and
June, then face three World Cup warm-up games during August
before beginning their World Cup defence against the USA in Lens
on September 8.
