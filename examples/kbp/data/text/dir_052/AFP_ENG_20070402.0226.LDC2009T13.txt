German Chancellor Angela Merkel was in Beirut on Monday for talks
with rival Lebanese leaders on the deep political crisis in the
country.


Merkel, whose country is currently EU president, is expected to
reiterate her full support for the Western-backed government of
Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, which is locked in a standoff with
the pro-Syrian opposition.


After meeting parliament speaker and opposition stalwart Nabih
Berri at his home, Merkel made a brief statement saying: "We
encourage the establishment of an independent state in Lebanon."


She will not meet Damascus-backed President Emile Lahoud who is
boycotted by the European Union.


Merkel also plans to visit one of the German ships taking part in
the UN peacekeeping force which was reinforced after last year's
devastating 34-day war between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite
militant group Hezbollah.


She arrived in Beirut shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Democrat
speaker of the US House of Representatives, who has angered the
White House because of her plans to visit Syria during her Middle
East tour.
