Indian share prices plunged 4.72 percent Monday, the sharpest
fall in nearly a year as bank, auto and housing stocks were sold
off after a central bank interest rate hike, dealers said.


They said concern that the central bank may take more steps to
cool inflation which has stayed above six percent for wholesale
prices in the past month had triggered the selling.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex fell 616.73
points to 12,455.37, it's biggest one-day drop since May 18,
2006.
