Bird flu has spread to more poultry farms in Bangladesh,
prompting authorities to step up culling of chickens and
monitoring of hundreds of workers, an official said Monday.


"We have so far culled 66,000 chickens in 22 farms in the
country. Over the weekend alone five more farms have been
infected," said top government livestock official Sunil Chandra
Ghosh.


"Hundreds of workers of the infected farms have been kept on the
watchlist of our medical teams so that we can monitor any
suspected bird flu transmission to human bodies," he said.


"So far there is no report of human infection", he added.


Officials confirmed Bangladesh's first case of bird flu last week
after samples from one of the farms were sent to the National
Institute of Animal Health in Bangkok.


The Thai laboratory confirmed the deadly H5N1 strain of the
virus.


The caretaker government has agreed a string of measures to
prevent the spread of the disease in the South Asian country of
144 million people.


The virulent H5N1 virus has killed more than 170 people since
late 2003, most of them in Southeast Asia, according to the World
Health Organisation.


Scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form easily spread
among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to
kill millions.


Bangladesh is home to hundreds of thousands of poultry farms
which employ more than a million people.


The country had already banned imports of live birds from more
than 50 countries including neighbouring India and Myanmar after
outbreaks were detected there.
