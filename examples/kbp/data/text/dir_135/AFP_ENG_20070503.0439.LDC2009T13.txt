Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe will discuss their countries' territorial dispute over
the Kuril islands at the G8 summit in Germany next month, a
Japanese official said Thursday.


"The two leaders agreed to make efforts in searching for an
agreement acceptable to both countries" at the June summit, said
Japanese foreign ministry spokesman Mitsuo Sakaba after talks in
Moscow between Foreign Minister Taro Aso and his Russian
counterpart Sergei Lavrov.


Soviet troops seized four of the Kuril islands after Japan's
World War II surrender in 1945 and expelled the Japanese
residents.


The dispute over the islands, which Japan continues to claim and
calls the Northern Territories, has prevented the two countries
from signing a peace treaty officially ending the war.


The Group of Eight (G8) includes Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
