A Dutch court on Thursday ruled that ABN Amro cannot sell its US
unit LaSalle bank without putting the decision to a vote by
shareholders in a blow for ABN Amro's plans for a friendly
takeover by Barclays.


The judges' decision to freeze the sale boosts a proposed rival
bid for ABN Amro by a three-bank consortium led by Royal Bank of
Scotland.


ABN management has agreed to a 67-billion euro (91-billion
dollar) deal with Barclays that includes a provision to sell US
unit LaSalle Bank to Bank of America before the completion of the
takeover.


The consortium has said it would offer 72 billion euros but wants
LaSalle to remain in the ABN Amro group.


The Dutch court case was brought by the Dutch VEB association of
shareholders which insisted that shareholders should be allowed
to vote on the sale.


Many shareholders prefer the offer of the consortium which is not
only higher but also partly in cash whereas the Barclay's offer
is a share swap.
