Millions of people voted on Thursday in the penultimate phase of
state polls in Uttar Pradesh in northern India, officials said.


Almost 45 percent of 15.7 million eligible voters cast their
votes in 52 constituencies, including in districts racked by a
Maoist insurgency, Deputy Election Commissioner R. Balakrishnan
said.


"The voting went off very peaceful and without any incident," he
said by telephone from the state capital Lucknow.


Officials said tight security was in place to safeguard the
election.


The polls come halfway through the five-year term of the national
government and are seen as a litmus test of popularity for
India's ruling Congress party and the main opposition Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).


Exit polls from the earlier rounds showed Mayawati Kumari, a
woman from India's lowest Dalit caste who leads the Bahujan Samaj
Party, edging ahead of incumbent chief minister Mulayam Singh
Yadav.


The Congress party was likely to better its previous tally of 25
seats, and the BJP was expected to do well, the opinion polls
said.


Earlier this year, the BJP won polls in the northern states of
Uttarakhand and Punjab.


Votes will be counted May 11.
