US President George W. Bush on Thursday sharply criticized China,
Cuba, Egypt, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela and other
countries over restrictions or attacks on the news media.


"No independent media are allowed in countries such as Cuba and
North Korea, and those who attempt to report are often
imprisoned," he said in a statement marking World Press Freedom
Day.


"Repressive laws severely restrict journalists and freedom of
speech in countries such as Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), Iran,
Libya, Syria, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe," he said.


"We condemn the harassment, physical intimidation, and
persecution that journalists, including bloggers and Internet
reporters, have faced in China, Egypt, Tunisia, and Vietnam; and
the unsolved murders of journalists in Lebanon, Russia, and
Belarus," he said.


"In undemocratic societies where governments suppress,
manipulate, and control access to information, journalists are on
the front lines of the people's battle for freedom. The danger
journalists face in such repressive States can be great -- and
even deadly," he said.


"The United States values freedom of the press as one of the most
fundamental political rights and as a necessary component of free
societies," he said.
