Two days after John Browne's shock resignation as the chief
executive of British energy group BP, a US lawyer said he still
wants to question Browne over BP's safety record in the United
States.


Browne, one of Britain's best-known executives who had run BP for
12 years, resigned suddenly on Tuesday after a newspaper group
won a legal battle to publish details of his relationship with
another man.


Brent Coon, an American lawyer representing BP workers injured in
a 2005 Texas refinery blast, said he nonetheless still wants to
probe Browne.


"We're going to depose that man," Coon told reporters on a
conference call. Coon said Browne is expected to appear at a
Houston, Texas, law office for questioning next Wednesday, and
said he would still pursue the former BP chief if he fails to
show up on US soil.


Coon, the chief lawyer of Brent Coon and Associates, has been
battling BP lawyers in a bid to question Browne about his
oversight of the Texas refinery.


The lawyer claims Browne approved corporate budget cuts that
weakened safety procedures at BP's Texas City refinery.


Fifteen people died and over 100 workers were injured in the
March 2005 explosion at the plant.


US government investigators have said critical equipment at the
refinery was "unsafe" and "antiquated" prior to the blast.


Coon said it was too early to tell if BP's new CEO, Tony Hayward,
would seek to settle hundreds of legal suits related to the
blast.
