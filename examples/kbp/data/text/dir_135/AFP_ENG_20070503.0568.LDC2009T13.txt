Wall Street share prices leapt to fresh record highs Thursday as
the stock market rally continued apace following generally
positive economic news and a bout of merger and takeover news in
recent days.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 29.90 points (0.23
percent) to 13,241.78 at the closing bell, notching up its 18th
record close this year and 22nd gain in 25 trading days.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite finished up 7.62 points (0.30
percent) at 2,565.46 while the broad-market Standard & Poor's
500 index rose 6.46 points (0.43 percent) to a preliminary close
of 1,502.38.


Critically, the S&P passed through the psychologically-
important 1,500 point mark, the first time it has closed above
that level since September 2000.


Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, said
the Dow was enjoying one of its best winning streaks in around 50
years amid a flurry of upbeat profit reports and private-equity
fueled takeovers.
