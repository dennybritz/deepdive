Mali's President Amadou Toumani Toure convincingly won last
weekend's presidential election according to official results
released on Thursday.


The preliminary official tally showed the former coup leader took
68.31 percent of the votes.


His closest rival, speaker of parliment and former prime minister
Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, trailed well behind with 18.59 percent of
the ballots.


The opposition which has alleged cases of "gross" irregularities
have vowed to get the result nullified in the court.


Toure, who ousted dictator Moussa Traore in 1991, installed a
multi-party system before stepping aside in 1992. He later stood
for presidential elections and won easily in 2002.


A total of eight candidates had been vying for the top job in the
vast west African country sitting on the edge of Sahara desert.


Boubacar Sow, national director of the ministry of territorial
administration which organised the election, said only 36 percent
of some 6.8 million potential voters bothered to turn out at the
polling stations.


Close to 2.5 million Malians voted out of 6.88 million registered
voters, from which some 1.5 million cast in favour of Toure while
less than half a million showed their support for Keita.


None of the remaining six hopefuls took even 100,000 votes each.


Days before official results were out Toure's camp already
claimed victory, ruling out a second round.


But the opposition insist the election was marred by fraud
including multiple voting.


Foreign observers have declared the election clean and fair,
despite some incidents of concern.
