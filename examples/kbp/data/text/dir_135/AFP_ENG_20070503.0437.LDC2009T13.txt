The European Union's main institutions will throw open their
doors to the public on Saturday to mark more than half a century
since the first move toward the bloc's creation.


People will be able to discuss Europe with EU and national
decision-makers at the European Parliament in Brussels, whose
plenary chamber will host three debates on past achievements,
future challenges, and climate change and energy.


Visitors can also take a rare guided tour of the nearby European
Council building, where the big decisions affecting the 27 member
countries are made.


The events, starting at around 10:00 am (0800 GMT) and running to
5:30 pm, will be attended by dignitaries led by Queen Paola of
Belgium.


The celebrations mark the anniversary of May 9, 1950, when
France's foreign minister Robert Schuman urged European nations
to pool their coal and steel production, a first foundation on
which to build closer European integration.


They also coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of
Rome, the text on which today's modern EU was built.


May 9 is now also known as Europe Day.
