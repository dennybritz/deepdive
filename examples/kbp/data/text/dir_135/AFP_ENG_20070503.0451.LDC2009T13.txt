Astronaut Walter Shirra, one of the "Mercury Seven" who flew on
the first manned US space flights, died Thursday, NASA said.


"He died of natural causes today," said NASA spokesman James
Hartsfield.


Shirra was 84.


He was one of the seven astronauts chosen 1959 for the Project
Mercury, the first US effort to send men into space and on
October 3, 1962 became the fifth American in space, piloting
Mercury 8 on a mission that lasted just over nine hours.


He is the only astronaut to have flown aboard all three early US
space programs -- Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.


US media reported he died in California.
