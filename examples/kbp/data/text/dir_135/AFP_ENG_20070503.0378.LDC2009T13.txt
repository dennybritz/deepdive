The international Red Cross revealed Thursday that one of its
humanitarian aid convoys came under attack from heavy gunfire in
the north of the country, injuring two Yemeni Red Crescent
volunteers.


The 15-truck convoy, organised jointly by the International
Committee of the Red Cross and the Yemeni Red Crescent Society,
was carrying emergency supplies to 560 displaced families on
Wednesday when it was attacked, the ICRC said in a statement .


One ICRC staff member and 40 Red Crescent volunteers were in the
convoy. The two injured volunteers were taken for treatment in
the town of Sadaa, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of al
Saifi where the attack took place.


"This attack jeopardizes vital humanitarian work," the ICRC said.


The organisation is distributing emergency supplies such as
tents, groundsheets, jerry cans, mattresses, blankets and soap to
more than 3,000 families who have been displaced during recent
fighting between the government and Shiite rebels.


Hundreds of people have died since the rebellion erupted in 2004.
The rebels reject as illegitimate the current republican regime
which seized power in a 1962 coup.
