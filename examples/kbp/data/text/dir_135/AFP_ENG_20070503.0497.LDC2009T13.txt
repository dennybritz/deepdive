The European Union "warmly welcomed" on Thursday a five-year
rescue plan for Iraq adopted at an international conference on
Iraqi security in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.


The EU said it commended the Iraqi government for the "ambitious
commitments it has made" in the so-called "International
Compact," launched at the meeting of top officials from more than
50 countries.


"Progress towards these targets will help to further enhance the
EU's engagement with Iraq," the EU, whose presidency is currently
held by Germany, said in a written statement released here.


It continued: "Our main objective is to help Iraq implement the
ambitious programme set out in the Compact and ensure that all
Iraqis can benefit from Iraq's resources."


It also noted the "responsibility of the international community,
and in particular the states in the region, to support and
promote these efforts."


The EU, it added, was "ready to continue to develop a close co-
operation and partnership with Iraq."


The plan includes measures to give fresh impetus to Iraq's
economy, improve governance and offer financial assistance, in a
process key players hope will bolster reconciliation between
warring communities.
