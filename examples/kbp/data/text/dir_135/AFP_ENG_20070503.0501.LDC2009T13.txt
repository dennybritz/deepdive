Several thousand opposition supporters rallied in central Yerevan
on Thursday ahead of parliamentary elections in this former
Soviet republic.


"Our aim is to get those in power out," Aram Sarksyan, a former
prime minister and head of the Republic party, told the crowd.


"We realise they'll do everything to keep their posts because
they know that they will go to court if they don't," Sarksyan
said.


Police estimated the number of opposition supporters at the rally
on Freedom Square in the centre of Yerevan at around 5,000.
Organisers said 13,000 people attended.


The protest was organised by the New Times and Republic parties,
as well as the Impeachment bloc, a coalition of opposition
groups. Organisers said the next protest would be on May 10.


Armenia is set to hold parliamentary elections on May 12.
