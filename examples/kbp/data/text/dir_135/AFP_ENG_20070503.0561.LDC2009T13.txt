US financial titan Bank of America said Thursday it held a
"binding contract" to purchase rival LaSalle even though a Dutch
court ruled ABN Amro could not sell the unit without shareholder
approval.


Bank of America issued a short statement on its 21-billion-dollar
bid to purchase LaSalle Bank Corporation, a US subsidiary of
Dutch-based ABN Amro, after the court ruling earlier Thursday
appeared to throw LaSalle's future into doubt.


"We have a binding contract and intend to take all necessary
steps to protect our legal rights," Bank of America said.


A spokesman for the US banking giant said Bank of America did not
want to comment further on the matter.


The court decision in the Netherlands delivered a blow to ABN
Amro's plans to accept a friendly takeover by Britain's Barclays
bank.


The decision to freeze the sale also bolsters a proposed rival
bid for ABN Amro by a three-bank consortium led by Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS).


ABN Amro's management has agreed to a 91-billion dollar deal with
Barclays that includes the sale of LaSalle to Bank of America
before the takeover is sealed.


The RBS consortium, however, is offering more cash for ABN Amro,
but wants LaSalle to remain in the ABN Amro group.


North Carolina-headquartered Bank of America announced its bid
for LaSalle in late April hoping it would accelerate its
expansion, particularly in the Chicago area.
