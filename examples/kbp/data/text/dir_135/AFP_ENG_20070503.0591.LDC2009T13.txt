Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened Thursday to
nationalize a major steel company and private banks unless they
make national interests a priority.


The president, in a televised address, said he would nationalize
steel maker Sidor if it continued to sell its production abroad
instead of selling it to domestic industries.


He also announced plans for a law to force the private banking
sector to give priority to financing of domestic producers.


If the banks flout the law, he warned, "they should leave."


Chavez holds the power to rule by decree for 18 months, granted
in January by parliament.
