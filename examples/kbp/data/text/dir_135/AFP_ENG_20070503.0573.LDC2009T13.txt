Chicago Bulls forward Luol Deng was awarded the Joe Dumars Trophy
as the National Basketball Association's most sportsmanship
player, the league announced Thursday.


The award is voted on by players and goes to the player who
exemplifies the ideals of sportsmanship on the court - ethical
behaviour, fair play and integrity.


Deng was not called for a technical foul or a flagrant foul this
season.


The trophy is named after Dumars, a Hall of Famer who serves as
president of the Detroit Pistons and was the award's first
recipient in 1996.


Ironically, Deng will be facing Dumars' Pistons in the Eastern
Conference semifinals starting this weekend.


Deng also was the Central Division nominee a year ago. This year,
he received 2,027 points in the balloting to edge Southwest
Division representative Shane Battier of the Houston Rockets, who
received 2,005 points.
