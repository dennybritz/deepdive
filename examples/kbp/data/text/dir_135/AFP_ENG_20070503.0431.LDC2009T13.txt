Spanish champions Barcelona's defence of their title was hit by
an injury to Portuguese international Deco on Thursday which will
sideline the midfielder for two weeks.


The Brazilian-born playmaker twisted his ankle in a training
ground clash with French forward Ludovic Giuly and will miss
Sunday's match away against Real Sociedad and the next at home
against Betis Seville on May 13.


He will also miss the second leg of the King's Cup semifinals
against Getafe next week.


Deco's absence will come as a blow to Barca boss Frank Rijkaard
as his league leaders attempt to hold off a late season charge
from Real Madrid, just two points behind, and the stubborn
challenge of Sevilla, one point down, with just six matches to go
in the title race.
