Apple chief executive Steve Jobs on Thursday responded to attacks
by environmental groups accusing the famously hip maker of iPod
MP3 players of not being green enough.


"Apple has been criticized by some environmental organizations
for not being a leader in removing toxic chemicals from its new
products, and for not aggressively or properly recycling its old
products," Jobs said in a message posted on the Cupertino,
California-based company's website.


"Upon investigating Apple's current practices and progress
towards these goals, I was surprised to learn that in many cases
Apple is ahead of, or will soon be ahead of, most of its
competitors in these areas."


Jobs details Apple's "desires and plans to become greener."


Those plans include ending the use of arsenic and mercury in
making computer screens and eliminating polyvinyl chloride and
bromated flame retardants in products.


By the end of this year, Apple will expand its recycling program
to 93 percent of the countries where its iPod players and
Macintosh computers are sold, according to Jobs.


Apple is examining the "overall carbon footprint" of its
products, Jobs said.


Apple's board of directors includes former US vice president Al
Gore, who won an Academy Award for his global warming documentary
"An Inconvenient Truth."


"Today is the first time we have openly discussed our plans to
become a greener Apple," Jobs wrote in closing. "It will not be
the last."
