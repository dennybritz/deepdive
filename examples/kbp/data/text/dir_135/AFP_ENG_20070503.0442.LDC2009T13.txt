The Vatican's centuries-old library plans to close for three
years from mid-July to carry out necessary renovations, a
spokesman told AFP on Thursday.


The "secret" archives, however, as well as the library's
microfiche service, will remain available to scholars throughout
the period, he was quick to add.


Rome's international historical and religious research community
was caught up short by the news, since the Vatican did not
announce the closure, although its website mentions it.


The main reading room will be emptied of its thousands of volumes
and ancient manuscripts, and the book maintenance and restoration
laboratories will be moved during the period.


The apostolic library, one of the world's oldest, dates back to
the earliest years of the papacy, although the official date of
its foundation is 1450.


It houses nearly 1.6 million old and new books, 8,300 incunabula
including several dozen parchment scrolls, more than 150,000
archive manuscripts and documents, as well as 300,000 coins and
medals and 20,000 art objects.


The secret archives, which have been open to qualified scholars
since the late 19th century, include sensitive items such as the
appeal of King Henry VIII of England to Pope Clement VII for an
annulment.
