Afghanistan and Pakistan have finalised lists of about 350 people
each to attend a joint "jirga," or gathering of influential
people, to tackle the Taliban insurgency, Pakistan's interior
minister said Thursday.


The two sides are now working on the details of the agenda for
the meeting, the first of its kind, Interior Minister Aftab
Sherpao told reporters in Kabul.


The jirga, to which the Afghan and Pakistan leaders agreed at
talks with US President George W. Bush in September, was first
scheduled for early in the year. Sherpao said no date had been
fixed.


Those on the invitation lists include tribal elders,
parliamentarians and intellectuals, said the minister, who
survived a suicide bombing on April 28 that killed at least 24
people.


The jirga, a tradition in Afghanistan, is intended to involve
local people more closely in efforts to end the Taliban
insurgency, which has grown steadily since the extremist movement
was driven from government in late 2001.


Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan are chilly, with each
accusing the other of not doing enough to curb the extremist
violence growing on both sides of the border.


Sherpao is due to visit President Hamid Karzai on the final day
of his visit Friday.
