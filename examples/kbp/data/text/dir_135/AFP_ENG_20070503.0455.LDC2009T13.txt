The Ethiopian government on Thursday dismissed criticism of its
record on press freedom, saying recent reports from rights
watchdogs were based on unfounded allegations.


"We regret that these reports are not based on research but only
on allegations. If they were based on research the Ethiopians
would welcome them," said information ministry official Fantahun
Asres.


Media rights groups Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the
International Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ)
released separate reports this week in which Ethiopia was singled
out for criticism.


Paris-based RSF said Addis Ababa was one of the "predators of
press freedom" and the New York-based CPJ put Ethiopia at the top
of a list of 10 countries where media rights had declined in the
past five years.


Ethiopian Justice Minister Assefa Kesito said democracy was still
in its infancy in the east African country.


"There is no doubt that freedom of expression should be allowed
to all, but there are a lot of sectors we have to work on," he
told a seminar here.
