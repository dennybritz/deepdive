Britain's Queen Elizabeth II arrived here Thursday on a rare US
visit to mark the 400th anniversary of an English settlement that
laid the foundations of history's greatest superpower.


The queen alighted a British Airways jet in Richmond, Virginia,
where a red carpet had been unrolled for her much-anticipated
arrival.


Elizabeth was due to start her six-day trip in the Virginia
capital Richmond and address the state's legislature, which is
America's oldest representative body.


The 81-year-old monarch is coming to the United States for the
first time since 1991, just after the Gulf War, and is marking
her fourth state visit overall since she originally came as a
young woman half a century ago.


Back then, she visited Jamestown for its 350th anniversary, and
is due to return with her husband Prince Philip, 85, on Friday.
