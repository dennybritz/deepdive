The US magazine Time named Canadian Maher Arar, who was wrongly
detained as a terror suspect and tortured, on its list of the 100
most influential people of the year.


Arar, 36, said in a statement he is "very honored" by the
distinction, and thanked his supporters during his "struggle for
justice."


The Syrian-born software engineer was detained by US authorities
in New York in 2002 while in transit from Tunisia to his home in
Canada, and then deported to Syria where he was jailed and
tortured for almost one year.


A Canadian judicial report in September 2006 cleared Arar of
terror ties and blasted federal police for wrongly labeling him
an "Islamic extremist." The botched case eventually cost Canada's
top policeman his job.


Ottawa apologized to Arar in January and offered him 11 million
Canadian dollars (10 million US) in damages to settle a lawsuit.


Another suit is still pending in the United States, which
meanwhile has refused to remove Arar from its terror watch list.


In Time, US Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy lamented that
President George W. Bush's administration still "refuses to
acknowledge any responsibility" in the affair.


"Maher Arar's case stands as a sad example of how we have been
too willing to sacrifice our core principles to overarching
government power in the name of security, when doing so only
undermines the principles we stand for and makes us less safe,"
he said.
