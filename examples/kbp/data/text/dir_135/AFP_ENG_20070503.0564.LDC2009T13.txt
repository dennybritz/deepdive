Still smarting from the 2000 presidential election fiasco and
subsequent voting problems, Florida legislators on Thursday
passed a bill requiring all voting precincts to adopt paper
ballot technology.


The bill, adopted 118-0, will do away with touch-screen voting
machines used in some counties, which do not leave the paper
trail electoral watchdogs say are needed for recounts in disputed
elections.


Florida had already banned the punch-card system that was used in
parts of the state and was blamed for much of the 2000 debacle,
when electoral chaos and legal wrangling held up the outcome of
the presidential election for 36 days until the US Supreme Court
halted recounts in Florida.


The southeastern state again faced electoral woes in the 2006
mid-term elections when officials ordered a recount in Sarasota
amid reports of discrepancies in the number of votes cast.


Ironically, that recount was for the congressional seat left
vacant by Katherine Harris, who as the state official in charge
of the 2000 election was widely blamed for the electoral chaos at
the time.


"This is a chance for Florida to emerge as a leader on election
technology and leave behind the tarnished reputation of being the
nation's laughingstock," Howard Simon of the American Civil
Liberties Union said after the Florida legislature passed the
bill.
