Mercury levels have no relationship to the development of autism,
a developmental disorder whose cause remains unclear, according
to a Canadian study published Thursday.


"In recent years, hypotheses have been raised concerning a
possible relationship between mercury exposure and autism," said
Eric Fombonne, head researcher and director of pediatric
psychiatry at the Montreal Children's Hospital.


"Specifically, the concerns have been related to childhood
thimerosal-containing vaccines, dental amalgams, and
methylmercury in food," he said in a statement.


The research team examined mercury levels in hair and blood
samples provided by autistic children and their mothers and
concluded that the levels observed did not differ largely from
those taken from children without autism.


The study also "demonstrated that there was no correlation
between the mercury level and the severity of symptoms and level
of functioning of autistic children."


Children with autism, a growing developmental concern which
appears before age three, often avoid physical contact and
communicate with gestures rather than speech.


A February study by the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention suggested that autism is more common in the United
States than previously believed, affecting one child in 150.


The Canadian study was performed on 71 autistic children and 75
children without the disorder.


Fombonne said the study's findings also implied that "chelation
therapies, whereby heavy metals are removed from the body using
specific compounds, are not useful in the treatment of autism."
