The White House on Thursday declined to take a position on
whether embattled Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert should
resign or what impact that would have on the Middle East peace
process.


US President George W. Bush "has a good working relationship with
the prime minister. He looks upon him as a man who is committed
to a two-state solution and working constructively toward peace,"
said spokesman Tony Snow.


"But after that, you get into Israeli politics, and we're not
going to do it," added Snow, who had said on April 30 that Olmert
was "essential" to the peace process.


Olmert has come under fire in the wake of a scathing government
report on the 34-day Lebanon war last year. A street protest was
planned for Thursday, one day after he doused a mutiny inside hs
own party.
