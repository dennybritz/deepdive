Mali's President Amadou Toumani Toure won last weekend's
elections with 68.31 percent of the votes, according to complete
provisional results released on Thursday by the government.


His closest rival, speaker of parliament and former prime
minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, trailed well behind with 18.59
percent of the ballots.


The opposition which has cited cases of "gross" irregularities
have vowed to have the result, that will give Toure his second
and final term, nullified in the court.


Toure, who ousted dictator Moussa Traore in 1991, installed a
multi-party system before stepping aside in 1992. He later stood
for presidential elections and won easily in 2002.


A total of eight candidates had been vying for the top job in one
of Africa's most impoverished countries.


Boubacar Sow, national director of the ministry of territorial
administration which organised the election, said the
participation rate stood at 36 percent.
