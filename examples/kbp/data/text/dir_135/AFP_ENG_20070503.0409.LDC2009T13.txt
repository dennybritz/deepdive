UN chief Ban Ki-moon said that debt reduction amounting to 30
billion dollars had been pledged by countries attending a key
conference on Iraq in this Egyptian resort on Thursday.


"Specific financial commitments by particular countries are
estimated at over 30 billion dollars," Ban told reporters.


"This includes commitments of debt relief terms of the Paris Club
from Bulgaria, China, Saudi Arabia and Greece. It also includes
new financial commitments from the United Kingdom, Australia,
Spain, China, Denmark and Korea and other key participants," he
said.


In 2004 the Paris Club, a group of 19 creditor governments from
major industrialised nations dealing with debt restructuring,
agreed to cancel 32 billion (80 percent) of the 40 billion
dollars they were owed by the Saddam regime.
