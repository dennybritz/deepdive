British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett met her Iranian
counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki on Thursday on the sidelines of a
conference on Iraq, an AFP journalist reported.


The meeting comes a month after Iran detained 15 British naval
personnel for two weeks, threatening to spark a major crisis amid
the West's standoff with the Islamic republic over its nuclear
programme.


The talks also come as US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has
been engaging in rare contacts with old foes Iran and Syria.


The diplomats are attending a two-day conference in the Egyptian
Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh aimed at stabilising war-torn
Iraq.
