Clifford Bond, former US ambassador to Bosnia, was appointed
Thursday as a special international envoy to the eastern Bosnian
town of Srebrenica, the scene of the worst single atrocity of the
Balkan wars.


His appointment by the international community's top
representative in Bosnia, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, comes amid
heightened tension in Srebrenica between Muslims and Serbs.


Serb forces massacred some 8,000 Muslim men and boys after
capturing Srebrenica in 1995. The slaughter was the worst single
atrocity in Europe since World War II and has been legally
classified an act of genocide.


Bond is to supervise the international community's activities in
the Srebrenica region and monitor the political situation,
Schwarz-Schilling said in a statement.


Srebrenica's Muslim majority council adopted a resolution last
month asking for the eastern town to break away from the Serb-run
Republika Srpska, of which it has been a part since the end of
Bosnia's 1992-1995 war.
