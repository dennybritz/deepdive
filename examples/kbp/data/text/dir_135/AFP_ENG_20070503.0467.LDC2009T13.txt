Philipp Kohlschreiber has the chance to avenge the defeat of
German compatriot Tommy Haas and reach the semi-finals of
Munich's ATP tournament for the first time after beating fifth-
seed Jarkko Nieminen on Thursday.


The 23-year-old's 6-1, 6-4 second-round win took just 79 minutes
and the German will meet Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean, who
knocked out top-seed Tommy Haas on Monday, in the quarter-finals.


On the MTTC Iphitos' centre court, Kohlschreiber put in a
confident display to beat the Finnish left-hander, ranked
28-places higher than the German and the winner of the Munich
event in 2003.


"I had nothing to lose, he is more than 20 places above me in the
world rankings, so I just had to go for it," said Kohlschreiber.


"I will do everything I can to reach the semi-finals now", he
promised as he reached a tournament quarter-final for the fourth
time this year.


Kohlschreiber's compatriot Alexander Waske will meet fourth-seed
Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in the last eight while Austrian eighth-
seed Jurgen Melzer takes on the third-seeded Russian Mikhail
Youzhny, who beat German Benjamin Becker 7-6, 6-3 in the second
round.
