A fierce gun battle broke out at Havana's Jose Marti airport
Thursday between police and three fugitive soldiers attempting to
commandeer an airplane to leave the country, an airport source
told AFP.


"Now everything everything is under control, but there was a
fierce gunfight," the source said, saying the men were riding a
bus toward a Boeing 737 at the Terminal 1 when the shooting took
place.


There was no official government confirmation of the incident or
information on casualties, but an airport official who would not
be identified told AFP that everything was normal at the airport.


The three men, young conscripts who fled their military unit
Saturday near Managua southeast of Havana, were "neutralized" by
the police, according to an airport worker.


The incident took place early Thursday when the men seized
several hostages in seeking to take over an aircraft which had
arrived from Santiago de Cuba at the east end of the island.


"The plane had arrived from Santiago and fortunately all the
passengers had already gotten off. Only the crew were left, who
then escaped through the front hatch. They were thinking the
kidnappers wanted to leave the country."


Since the weekend Havana has been abuzz with talk of the three
soldiers and security was tightened on roads into the capital.


In 2003 a Russia AN-24 with 31 people aboard was taken over and
forced to fly to the United States by a man armed with grenades,
who was ultimately detained without incident after the plan
landed in Key West, Florida.
