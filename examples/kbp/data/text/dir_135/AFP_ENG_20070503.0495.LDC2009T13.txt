The European Court of Human Rights on Thursday threw out a
Greenpeace action against Denmark over three members' conviction
for trespassing on a US military base in Greenland.


The activists, Denmark's Vincent Custers, France's Olivier
Deveaux and Lawrence Martin Turk of the United States, were
arrested in August 2001 as they tried to break into the US air
base at Thule in the northwest.


The base houses a radar station intended for use as part of
Washington's planned missile shield programme.


A Danish court convicted them of illegal entry the following
month and fined them approximately 670 euros (910 dollars) each,
a ruling confirmed on appeal.


The three activists argued before the Strasbourg court that
because the forbidden area had been neither closed off nor
clearly marked out, no punishable crime had been committed.


But the judges in Strasbourg unanimously followed the Danish
courts in rejecting the argument.


The base at Thule was set up in 1951 during the Cold War as an
early warning station for Soviet activities.


It has since been modernised to become a satellite tracking
station and is used to monitor activity in the Northern
Hemisphere.
