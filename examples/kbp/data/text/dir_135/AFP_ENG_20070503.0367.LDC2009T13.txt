Two Britons have been arrested in Macedonia over their alleged
involvement in a crash that claimed the life of a local man
during a car rally by celebrities and millionaires, police said
Thursday.


Nick Morley and Matthew McConville, who were participants in the
cross-border "Gumball 3000" rally, were detained at Macedonia's
border with Albania late on Wednesday, police said.


Morley was the driver of a turbo Porsche 911 that had allegedly
collided with a local car earlier the same evening, killing
Vladimir Cepuloski, 67, and seriously injuring his wife near the
southern town of Struga.


"Charges will be pressed against the British citizen for
jeopardising traffic safety and the failure to provide aid to
those injured" in the accident, police spokesman Ivo Kotevski
told AFP.


McConville was being held on suspicion of having tried to help
Morley to flee the former Yugoslav republic.


Other participants in the Gumball rally include British
celebrities such as the actor Orlando Bloom, best-known for his
role in "Lord of the Rings," and Jay Kay, the lead singer of the
pop group Jamiroquai.


The rally, which involves some 180 luxury cars, had entered
Macedonia from Greece and was travelling towards Albania when the
accident occurred.
