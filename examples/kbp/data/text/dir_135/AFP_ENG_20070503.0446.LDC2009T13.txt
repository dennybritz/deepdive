A US soldier accused of murdering a truck driver in Kyrgyzstan
has been flown back to the United States, the US embassy said
here Thursday.


"With the Kyrgyz investigation complete, there was no longer a
need for the airman's presence in Kyrgyzstan," an embassy
spokesman told AFP.


He said Zachary Hatfield was flown out of Kyrgyzstan on March 21,
was under US jurisdiction and would be investigated by US
authorities.


Kyrgyz prosecutors say that Hatfield should be tried for the
shooting murder last December of Alexander Ivanov, a Kyrgyz
national.


The US military says Hatfield acted in self-defense, firing two
bullets into the man's chest at a checkpoint outside the Manas
air base after the driver had threatened him with a knife.
