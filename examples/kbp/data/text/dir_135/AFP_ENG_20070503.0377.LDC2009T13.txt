Russia is free to move troops across its territory without
informing Western partners after it froze observance of a Soviet-
era arms treaty, First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov was
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Thursday.


"We declared a moratorium and we will not inform anyone about
movement of troops across our own territory," said Ivanov, who is
seen as a contender to replace President Vladimir Putin next
year.


Putin last week declared a freeze on observance of the
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.


Ivanov said the moratorium would last until all NATO countries
ratify a revised 1999 version of the 1990 treaty.


The CFE treaty imposes strict limits on deployment of tanks,
troops and other forces in countries belonging to NATO and to
what in 1990 was the Soviet- dominated Warsaw Pact in eastern
Europe.
