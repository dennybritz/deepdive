Rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy has increased his lead in the race
against socialist Segolene Royal to become French president since
a head-to-head television debate, a new poll showed late
Thursday.


The CSA-Cisco poll, the first to be carried out since Wednesday's
debate, put Sarkozy on 53 percent, up one percentage point, and
Royal on 47 percent, down one percentage point.


Wednesday's debate ahead of Sunday's final-round vote was watched
by more than 20 million viewers.
