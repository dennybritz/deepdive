The lawyer for a detained Nigerian separatist leader Thursday
said his client, Mujahid Asari Dokubo, was "dying".


"Asari is dying, and nothing must happen to him", Festus Keyamo,
lead counsel to the detained leader of the Niger Delta Peoples
Volunteer Force, told AFP.


He said Dokubo, who is not a diabetic, is "urinating more than 20
times a day".


"The man must not die in custody. Otherwise, the director of the
State Security Service (SSS) must be ready to face murder
charges", Keyamo said.


The lawyer said SSS officials panicked over Dokubo's health
earlier this week and called in both the detainee's doctor and an
SSS doctor to jointly examine the prisoner.


He said the doctors were not able to diagnose any ailment.


Keyamo asked for Dokubo, who has been in detention on treasonable
felony charges since 2005, to be transferred to regular police
custody in accordance with earlier court orders.


He was charged with planning to overthrow the government of
President Olusegun Obasanjo and with inciting the people of the
oil-rich Niger Delta to take up arms against regional governors
over alleged mismanagement of public funds.


The Niger delta, a swathe of creeks and swamps and the size of
Scotland, is home to Nigeria's multi-billion dollar oil and gas
industry.


The region has seen a resurgence in violent attacks on oil firms
and personnel over the past two years.


More than 100 foreign workers have been kidnapped, but were later
released there, while scores of Nigerian security personnel have
been killed by militant groups or armed gangsters.
