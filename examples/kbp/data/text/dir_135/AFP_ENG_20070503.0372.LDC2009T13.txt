A five-year plan aimed at stabilising Iraq known as the
"International Compact" was overwhelmingly adopted Thursday at a
key conference in Egypt, a senior UN official told AFP.


"The resolution to support Iraq and to pull it out of its crisis
has been adopted by acclamation by all the participants," the
UN's pointman in Iraq Ashraf Qazi said.


No vote took place but the rescue plan was approved by a general
consensus, he explained.


The International Compact with Iraq (ICI) is an initiative
drafted by the United Nations, World Bank and Baghdad aimed at
stabilising Iraq on the political, economic and security levels.


"We know the road ahead is long and tough but we also know that
the Iraqi government alone will not be able to do it," Qazi said.
"The international community undertook a vow to support Iraq in
its crisis."


Foreign ministers and top diplomats from more than 50 countries
were gathered in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for a
two-day conference aimed at lifting Iraq out of chaos.


The meeting marked the biggest diplomatic push to solve Iraq's
woes since the 2003 US-led invasion.
