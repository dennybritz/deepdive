Shares in British building materials group Hanson soared by more
than 20 percent on Thursday after HeidelbergCement, Germany's
leading cement maker, said it was considering a takeover offer.


Hanson shares surged 20.38 percent to close at 1,025 pence, while
London's FSTE 100 shares index finished 0.82 percent higher at
6,537.80 points.


"HeidelbergCement is currently reviewing its options with respect
to its interest in Hanson, including the possibility of seeking
to acquire the company," the German group said in an official
statement on the London Stock Exchange.


"However, there can be no certainty that an acquisition will
result or what the terms of such an acquisition may be."


Hanson's current stock market capitalisation stands at some 7.3
billion pounds (10.7 billion euros, 14.5 billion dollars).
