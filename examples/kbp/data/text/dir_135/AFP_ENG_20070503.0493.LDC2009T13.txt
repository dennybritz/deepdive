The Islamic State in Iraq, an alliance of Sunni groups headed by
the Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda, confirmed that its spokesman had
been killed, in an Internet statement posted on Thursday.


"We announce news of the martydom of the sheikh and fighter Abu
Abdullah al- Juburi," it said on a website often used by Al-Qaeda
in Iraq.


But "our guide Abu Omar al-Baghdadi is well," the group said,
denying earlier claims from Iraqi officials that he had been
killed while confirming US reports that it was Juburi who was
killed.
