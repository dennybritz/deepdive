Delta Air Lines stock moved skyward Thursday as new shares traded
for the first time since the third-largest US carrier emerged
from bankruptcy this week.


In late morning trade, the shares quoted under the DAL symbol
were up 3.4 percent at 21.09 dollars.


Delta executives were participating in the opening bell and
closing bell ceremonies on the New York Stock Exchange to mark
resumption of trading in the shares.


The company is making the initial distribution of its new common
stock to some unsecured creditors and to some 39,000 employees.


"There is a renewed spirit at Delta that starts with our
employees' commitment to outstanding customer service. That
energy permeates the company as we remain focused on executing a
solid business plan that we expect will deliver great value for
all of our stakeholders, including customers, employees, business
partners and, of course, our new shareholders," said Edward
Bastian, vice president and chief financial officer.


Delta exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday after 19
months of court- supervised bankruptcy protection.
