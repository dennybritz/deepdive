Nigerian president-elect, Umaru Yar'Adua, told international
investors on Thursday that his adminstration would keep to
outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo's policies, state news
agency NAN reported.


"The policies, focus and direction of government will continue
with the same determination", Yar'Adua told a meeting in Abuja of
the Honorary International Investment Council on Nigeria.


Yar'Adua, who was Obasanjo favoured candidate in the country's
April presidential poll, defeated other 24 candidates in a
landslide victory that was nevertheless tarnished by allegations
of vote rigging.


Several local and international groups and monitors, including
the US and European Union have said the elections fell short of
democratic standards.


Yar'adua will officially take over from Obasanjo next May 29.
