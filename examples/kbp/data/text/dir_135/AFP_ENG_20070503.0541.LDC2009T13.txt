Sweden's Joakim Backstrom shot a 10-under par course record 62 to
take the first round lead at the Italian Open here on Thursday.


Backstrom, a lowly 447th in the rankings, was only one stroke shy
of the European Tour's lowest round of the season.


He is one shot clear of Austria's Markus Brier, winner of last
month's China Open with Japan's Taichi Teshima the same distance
back in third.


Backstrom, whose opening round fireworks included two eagles and
half a dozen birdies, said: "I had a 62 in practice last week,
but that's my best round in a tournament.


"The greens are rolling superbly, so if you are within 10 feet
you feel fairly confident that it is going to go in."


Tom Lehman, last year's American Ryder Cup captain who attended
his first ever football match, AC Milan's Champions League win
over Manchester United at the San Siro the evening before,
returned a two under par 70.


"It was amazing - the emotion and the passion of the crowd was
mind-blowing," he recalled of Milan's semi-final win.


"As for my game, it's just so erratic. I saw some great golf from
my partners, though."
