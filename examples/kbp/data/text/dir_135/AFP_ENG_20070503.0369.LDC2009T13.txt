Former Olympic champion Irina Privalova is aiming to make a
comeback ahead of the Beijing Olympics, after seven years away
from the sport, her coach and husband said Thursday on the
International Athletics Federation (IAAF) website.


Privalova was a sprinter but after the emergence of the dominant
Marion Jones, she stepped up to 400m hurdles and came away with
the Sydney Olympic title in only her eighth race in the event.


However, injuries and pregnancies have kept her off the track
since then and now 38, her husband Vladimir Paraschuk says she is
ready to return.


"On the current training session we're paying very much attention
to Irina's complete recovery after the variety of injuries she
had during her whole career, but there's no place for taking
risks.


"The aim is still the same - participation in the 2008 Olympic
Games. The exact distances are yet to be considered, but the
likely choice will be the usual 100 and 200 metres."


Privalova was one of the top European sprinters in her time,
winning three sprint golds at the European Championships while
also winning a World Championships relay gold in Stuttgart in
1993.
