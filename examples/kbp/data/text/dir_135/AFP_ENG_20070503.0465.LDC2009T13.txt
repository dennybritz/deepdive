Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has cancelled a visit to
Italy and the Vatican scheduled for May 6-8, the president's
office said in a statement on Thursday.


The statement said new dates for the visit, during which
Yushchenko was supposed to meet Pope Benedict XVI, would be set
"soon" following diplomatic consultations.


Yushchenko has been locked in a bitter political dispute for
weeks with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, who has defied the
president's order to dissolve parliament and hold early
elections.
