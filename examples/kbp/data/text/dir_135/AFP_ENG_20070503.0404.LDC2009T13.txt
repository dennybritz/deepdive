A British soldier was killed in Afghanistan Thursday while
manning a checkpoint near a military base, the Ministry of
Defence (MoD) said in a statement.


The soldier, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, and his fellow
troops were involved in an early-morning battle in Garmsir,
Helmand Province, with up to 10 Taliban fighters which lasted
nearly two hours.


The group initially came under small arms fire, which they
returned, before the Taliban started using rocket propelled
grenades.


Two Dutch F16 fighter jets were then called to provide aerial
back-up and a 500 pound (225 kilogram) bomb was dropped on the
Taliban firing position.


The soldier was shot early on in the battle and evacuated to
receive medical treatment but died later, the MoD said.


The death brings to 54 the number of British troops killed in
Afghanistan since the hardline Taliban were ousted from power in
late 2001.


Britain has pledged an extra 1,400 troops for Afghanistan who are
due to arrive within weeks, taking the country's contingent in
the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) led by NATO to
7,700.


Most are based in Helmand, where the Taliban have a strong
presence.
