Outgoing French President Jacques Chirac was praised by German
Chancellor Angela Merkel for strengthening Franco-German
relations as he paid a farewell visit to Berlin on Thursday.


Chirac and Merkel inspected troops from a joint French and German
army unit before, in a break with tradition, the chancellor made
a speech in his honour outside the chancellery.


Thanking him for the "long years of cooperation between our two
countries", Merkel said 74-year-old Chirac "had constantly been
aware that Franco-German cooperation always needed a dynamism."


Chirac, she recalled, had been the first foreign head of state to
give a speech to the unified German parliament in the restored
Reichstag building in 2000.


Chirac, making his 32nd visit to Germany in 12 years as
president, said:  "It is both very important and symbolic that my
last official visit should be to Germany."


Germany and France are often called the "motor" of the European
Union and Berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign ports
of call for either the rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy or the
Socialist candidate Segolene Royal following the second round of
the French presidential election on Sunday.


Merkel will want to hear the views of the new president on how
France, whose voters rejected the draft EU constitution in a 2005
referendum, proposes to break the impasse.


Chirac said France and Germany must take the lead in Europe on
issues such as the constitution and the pressing issue of climate
change. "We must do all of that together or it will not be done
well," he said.


Germany holds the rotating EU presidency until the end of June.
