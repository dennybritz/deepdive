An officer and a soldier were killed Thursday by two military
deserters trying to hijack an airplane in Havana's airport, the
interior ministry said.


Airport sources said earlier the heavily-armed deserters were
thwarted in their attempt to take over a Boeing 737 after a
fierce gun battle in Jose Marti airport's Terminal 2, from where
charter flights head to Miami and New York.
