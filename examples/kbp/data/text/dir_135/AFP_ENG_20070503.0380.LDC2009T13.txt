Hundreds of traders have filed a lawsuit against the Zambian
government after their stalls were destroyed on the grounds that
they were illegal, their lawyer said Thursday.


The 502 marketeers and hawkers whose stalls and mechandise were
razed to the ground last week filed the suit in the Lusaka high
court against government and housing minister Sylvia Masebo, said
lawyer Mathew Pikiti.


"They are demanding compensation for the goods and money lost
during the demolition exercise," Pikiti said.


The Lusaka high court will hear the case on May 18.


It is the second time the Zambian government has been taken to
court by citizens whose property has been destroyed in an
operation aimed at removing illegal settlements in the southern
African nation.


Dozens of people whose shanties were razed by the government
earlier this year have also launched a legal battle with the
government, claiming compensation and the return to their land
which authorities claim they occupied illegally.
