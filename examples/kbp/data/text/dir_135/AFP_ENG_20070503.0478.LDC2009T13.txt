German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country
holds the EU and G8 presidencies, on Thursday urged the
international community to help Iraq create the security
conditions needed for political and economic stability.


"We know the situation in Iraq is horrible and of course we feel
for the people who are suffering there, with too many murder
victims each day," he said on the sidelines of the international
conference on Iraq being held in Egypt.


"But that is not enough. We have to contribute to efforts to
allow Iraq to create stability and money is not enough to do
that," he told reporters.


"The building of infrastructure will really only progress when
the security conditions are such that companies can work there."


Asked about Thursday's meeting between US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice and her Syrian counterpart Walid Muallem and
potential talks between Rice and Iran's Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki, he hoped it was the start of a longer
dialogue between the United States and Iraq's neighbours.


"It is certainly not yet a breakthrough. We cannot draw the
conclusion that because of a meeting things will improve,"
Steinmeier said.


"But a meeting like this may be a beginning of a dialogue that
contributes to clearing up existing misunderstandings and
preventing future ones from developing," he said.


"In any case I hope that such a dialogue will be a contribution
to the improvement of the whole situation in the Middle East."
