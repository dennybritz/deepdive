The head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe on Thursday called on Estonia and Russia to peacefully
settle their diplomatic row over the removal of a Soviet monument
in Tallinn.


"I urge all parties to show reserve and abstain from any sort of
violence," said Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos,
whose country holds the rotating OSCE presidency.


"This crisis must be resolved through dialogue and cooperation,"
he added in a press release.


There were riots before and after the Estonian authorities took
the bronze statue of a Red Army soldier from a downtown Tallinn
square last Friday, leaving one dead and dozens injured.


The monument, which commemorates the Soviet victory over Nazi
Germany, was put in an Estonian military cemetery this week.


Russians see the statue at the heart of the row as a sacred
memorial to Red Army soldiers who defeated Nazism, while
Estonians view it as a bitter reminder of the long Soviet
occupation.


Estonia's embassy in Moscow has since and its ambassador to
Russia threatened.


Moratinos said he regretted the death in Tallinn and was
following events at the Estonian embassy in Russia.


"Diplomats and embassies have historically benefited from a
special protection under international law. I am certain that all
OSCE member states wish that this tradition continues," he said.
