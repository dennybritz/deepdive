England captain Michael Vaughan was sent to hospital for x-rays
on a damaged finger after being forced to retire hurt while
playing for his club Yorkshire on Thursday.


Vaughan, seeking to bat himself into some form after a woeful
World Cup, had scored 16 in Yorkshire's second innings against
Hampshire at the Rose Bowl when he was struck on the right hand
by a sharply rising delivery from Australian pace bowler Stuart
Clark.


After receiving some on-field treatment Vaughan, who scored 72 in
the first innings, opted to carry on but after one more delivery
from Clark and two at the other end from James Bruce, Vaughan
walked off with out adding to his total.


Yorkshire's director of professional cricket Martyn Moxon
confirmed Vaughan would need hospital attention.


Moxon said: "We are looking at him now but we will be sending him
for an x-ray later tonight.


"We will have to wait until tomorrow (Friday) to see how things
develop."


Vaughan chose to play in the match to gain much-needed time in
the middle in preparation for the first Test with the West Indies
in two weeks' time.
