A Russian opposition group that has held controversial protests
targeted by security forces is planning to hold a rally to
coincide with the EU-Russia summit on May 18, organisers said.


"The organising committee has submitted a request to hold a
'March of the Dissenters' opposition protest on May 18,"
organisers from the group, a loose coalition known as The Other
Russia, said in a statement.


The Other Russia has held a series of unsanctioned protests with
thousands of supporters in recent months in Moscow, Saint
Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod that have led to tough police
action and dozens of arrests.


The group is led by two outspoken opponents to President Vladimir
Putin -- former world chess champion Garry Kasparov and former
prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who has declared he will run in
March 2008 presidential elections.


The key demands for the protest are better social welfare and
housing in Samara, an industrial city on the Volga River in
southwest Russia which will host the summit, the statement said.
