Arsene Wenger has completed a disciplinary hat-trick after being
fined for the third time this season over his conduct during or
after matches.


But the Arsenal manager, who was ordered by the Football
Association to cough up 2,500 pounds, escaped a touchline ban
after being found guilty of a charge of improper conduct for
suggesting a linesman had lied about a fracas involving Gunners
players during their stormy League Cup final defeat by Chelsea in
February.


Wenger had accused the linesman of lying by saying in his match
report that Emmanuel Adebayor, one of two Arsenal players to be
sent off, had hit Chelsea's Frank Lampard.


The FA subsequently revealed that the linesman had only reported
that Adebayor had been behaving in an aggressive fashion.


Wenger has now been obliged to pay a total of 15,000 pounds this
season for his touchline antics.


Last month he was fined 2,500 for an outburst at match officials
which resulted in him being banished to the stands for the second
half of his side's 2-2 draw with Portsmouth on December 16.


And last year he was ordered to pay 10,000 pounds for his part in
a touchline confrontation with then-West Ham manager Alan Pardew
during a match in October.
