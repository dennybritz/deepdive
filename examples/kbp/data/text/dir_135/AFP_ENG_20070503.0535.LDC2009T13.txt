Sports icons Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan drew a massive crowd
in the pro-am portion of this week's Wachovia Championship.


Woods, who has 12 major PGA titles, asked tournament officials if
he could be paired with Jordan, who has six National Basketball
Association championships and five most valuable player awards.


Jordan may not be able to hit the golf ball as far as Woods but
he talks a good game.


"I throw a jab back every now and then," Woods said. "But this is
my home court. It is a lot easier for me."


The two, who first played together 10 years ago, also traded
pranks and wisecracks while playing Wednesday in a trio with a
Charlotte area car salesman.


The huge gallery swelled to about 10,000 as they played their 18
holes at the Quail Hollow Club course.


It was a nice touch to put us together," Woods said. "He's like
my big brother. We always have a great time."


Skipper Beck set four alarm clocks to go off Wednesday morning so
the car dealer didn't miss his date with history.


"I laid my head on the pillow last night and had four alarm
clocks set, and I had somebody call from my office," Beck said.


"I was scared to death. I had this vision of running down No. 3
going 'I'm here, I'm here' and missing that 7:30 tee time."
