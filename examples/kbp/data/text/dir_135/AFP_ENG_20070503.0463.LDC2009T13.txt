US plans to deploy an anti-missile system in central Europe
signal the start of a new "uncontrollable" arms race, the Russian
army's chief of staff said on Thursday.


"I believe that the deployment of US anti-missile defence in
Europe is the beginning of a new round of an uncontrollable arms
race," General Yury Baluyevsky said, Interfax news agency
reported.


Baluyevsky, who has been critical of US plans to deploy
interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech
Republic, was speaking to the official Rossiyskaya Gazeta daily
in an interview due to be published on Friday.


Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the
anti-missile system increased the danger of mutual destruction
and dismissed US assertions that it would defend against missiles
from Iran and North Korea.
