Climate change experts meeting at a crucial UN conference have
agreed on measures needed to combat global warming, with the
report to be formally approved later Friday, a French delegate
told AFP.


"It is over. The report has been accepted. The formal adoption
will take place in the morning," Marc Gillet, the French
delegation head, said following a marathon session of talks that
finished around 4:30 am (2130 GMT Thursday).
