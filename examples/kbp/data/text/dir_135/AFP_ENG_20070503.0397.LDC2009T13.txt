Spanish champions Barcelona's title defence bid was hit by an
injury to Portuguese playmaker Deco on Thursday.


The Brazilian-born midfielder twisted his ankle in a training
ground clash with French forward Ludovic Giuly and faces a two
week spell on the sidelines.


Deco's absence will come as a blow to Barca boss Frank Rijkaard
as his league leaders attempt to hold off a late season charge
from Real Madrid, just two points behind, and the stubborn
challenge of Sevilla, one point down.


There are six matches to go in the title race with Barcelona
travelling to struggling Real Sociedad on Sunday, although
recently they have not been in their best form.


Deco will miss that game and the next against Getafe.
