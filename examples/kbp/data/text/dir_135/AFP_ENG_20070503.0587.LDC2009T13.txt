The Royal Canadian Mint unveiled the world's first 100-kilogram
(220.5-pound) pure gold bullion coin Thursday, worth one million
Canadian dollars (850,000 US), breaking a record for value.


But the loonie, a sobriquet given to Canadian one-dollar coins,
will not go into circulation, mint spokeswoman Alex Reeves told
AFP.


"It's a new denomination for us and required an amendment to the
Canadian currency act," he said, adding that three of the coins
were produced only after interested buyers came forward.


It is 21 inches (53 centimeters) in diameter and 1.2 inches
(three centimeters) thick.


Like all Canadian coins, it features on one side a likeness of
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, also Canada's head of state, by
celebrated Canadian portrait artist Susanna Blunt.


The other side bears an elegant maple leaf designed by Mint
artist and senior engraver Stan Witten.


Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon, who is also responsible for
the Mint, said in a statement the coin "takes Canada's reputation
in the gold bullion industry to an unprecedented level."


Starting in two weeks, one of the coins will tour Canada and the
United States, with tours under consideration in Europe and Asia.


Reeves said each coin takes up to eight weeks to craft by hand.
As such, more of them would only be minted on demand for
collectors and niche investors.


The last time such a special coin was minted, in Austria, all 15
-- worth 100,000 euro (130,000 US) each -- sold out in less than
a month.
