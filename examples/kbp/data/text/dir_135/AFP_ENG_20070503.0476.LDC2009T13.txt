The Moroccan communications minister on Thursday slammed as
biased a damning report on press freedoms in Morocco by the US-
based Committee to Protect Journalists.


"We are very surprised by this unobjective report which in no way
reflects the situation of press freedom in Morocco,"
Communications Minister Nabil Benabdellah told reporters here.


Ahead of Thursday's World Press Freedom Day, the New York-based
CPJ had said that Morocco, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Russia were
among the 10 countries where press rights had deteriorated most
in five years.


Morocco was singled out with Tunisia "as the Arab world's leading
jailer of journalists," in the report covering 2002-2007.


Turning to a separate report by Morocco's national press union
(SNPM), also released Wednesday, Benabdellah said that despite
its criticisms, it had welcomed developments in the Moroccan
media.


Contacted on Thursday by AFP, SNPM General Secretary Younes
Moujahid said he opposed the "logic of classifying adopted by the
CPJ", saying it opted instead for a "qualitative" approach.


"The situation of press freedom in Morocco is currently mixed,"
he said. "On the one hand, there are improvements, but on the
other, the authorities still leave open the possibility of going
backwards."


On Wednesday, the SNPM annual report said that the press was
freer than in the past in Morocco but there were attempts to gag
the media.
