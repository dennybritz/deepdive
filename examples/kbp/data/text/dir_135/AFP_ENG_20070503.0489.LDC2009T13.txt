Hong Kong-based journalist Leu Siew Ying on Thursday received the
European Union's annual journalism prize for human rights
reporting.


The independent jury, chaired by CNN's Femi Oke, awarded the
grand prix of the Natali Prize competition to Leu for an article,
published in the South China Morning Post, about villagers in
southern China who tried to sack their elected headman for
suspected corruption.


In presenting the prize, EU Commissioner for Development and
Humanitarian Aid Louis Michel expressed his belief that
"principled and skilled journalists are vital to the defence of
democracy and human rights.


"Without democracy, without freedom of press, development cannot
be sustainable," he said, speaking on International Press Freedom
Day.


Michel also used the opportunity to support the call for the
release of Alan Johnston the BBC correspondent who has been held
in the Gaza Strip since March 12.


The prize, established in 1992, commemorates Lorenzo Natali, a
former European Commissioner for Development and a fervent
defender of human rights.


This year, the prize attracted a record interest, with 1529
nominees from 165 countries.
