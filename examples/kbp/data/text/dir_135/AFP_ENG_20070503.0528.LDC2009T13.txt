US Vice President Dick Cheney will travel to the Middle East next
week, making stops in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, and Jordan, the White House announced Thursday.


Cheney's office said the vice president would head to the region
on Tuesday and return May 14.


"President Bush has asked the Vice President to travel to the
region for discussions with the leaders of these nations on key
issues of mutual interest," his office said in a statement.


Cheney will meet with UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-
Nahayan, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, and Jordan's King Abdullah II, according to the
statement.


"The vice president also will meet with US military commanders
and speak with US troops stationed in the Persian Gulf region,"
it said.


The trip will be Cheney's second major foray overseas this year:
He traveled to Japan, Guam, Australia, Oman, Pakistan and
Afghanistan in late February.
