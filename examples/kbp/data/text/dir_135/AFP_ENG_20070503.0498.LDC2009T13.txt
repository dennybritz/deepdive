Burundi's president inaugurated the headquarters of a new
initiative for Africa's Great Lakes region on Thursday designed
to bring stability and boost development in the troubled area.


President Pierre Nkurunziza's inauguration of the site in the
Burundian capital followed the opening of a meeting of foreign
ministers from the 11 countries participating in the initiative,
called the International Conference for the African Great Lakes
Region.


The pact, signed in Nairobi in December 2006, is an attempt to
stabilise the region. It has been signed by Great Lakes
countries, as well as states bordering the Democratic Republic of
Congo, which is attempting to emerge from years of conflict.


"It is a very important day for our countries because it opens a
new chapter in our efforts to transform the Great Lakes region
into a haven for peace for all, stability and shared
development," said Liberata Mulamula, the Tanzanian executive
secretary of the initiative.
