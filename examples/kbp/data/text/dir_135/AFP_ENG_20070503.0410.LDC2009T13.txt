A fierce gun battle broke out at Havana's airport Thursday
between police and three draftees attempting to commandeer an
airplane to leave the country, an airport source told AFP.


"Now everything everything is under control, but there was a
fierce gunfight," the source said, saying the men were riding a
bus toward a Boeing 737 at the Terminal 1 when the shooting took
place.


There was no official government confirmation of the incident or
information on casualities.
