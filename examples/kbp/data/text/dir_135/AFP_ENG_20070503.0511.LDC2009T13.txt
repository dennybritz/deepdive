US Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned Thursday that leaving
Iraq in chaos would lead to disaster in the Middle East and
ultimately the United States.


Speaking in Dallas, Texas, Gates said weariness with the war in
Iraq is understandable, but should not cause the United States to
withdraw from the world.


"Our country is troubled and divided by a long and difficult war
in Iraq. We want our troops home and out of harm's way," he said.


"And yet, most also know -- or at least sense -- that leaving
chaos behind in Iraq us will bring dramatically more suffering
for Iraqis but also disaster for the Middle East -- and also for
us," Gates said.


His remarks came amid an intensifying debate over the war in Iraq
with Democrats in Congress pushing for a withdrawal of US forces
and President George W. Bush sending more US troops into the
country to try to stabilize it.
