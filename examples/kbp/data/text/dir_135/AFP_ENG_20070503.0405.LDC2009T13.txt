Communist insurgents shot dead a political candidate in the
Philippine town of Daraga late Thursday in the latest violence in
the run-up to May 14 elections, police said.


Retired police chief Enrique Bausa, who is running for councillor
in Daraga town, south of Manila, was addressing a civic group
when two men approached him and shot him in the head, said
provincial police chief Senior Superintendent Herold Ubalde.


The gunmen escaped while the terrified crowd, including Bausa's
teenage daughter, were ducking for cover.


The communist New People's Army (NPA) had targetted him for being
tough against the insurgents when he was police chief, said
Ubalde.


Daraga chief of police Superintendent Jose Capinpin said they had
warned Bausa, who is running as an independent, that the NPA were
targetting him but he insisted on campaigning openly.


The NPA is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, which has been waging a Maoist rebellion against the
government since 1969 in one of the world's longest running
communist insurgencies.


Bausa is the latest victim in escalating poll violence that has
forced President Gloria Arroyo to tap the armed forces to prevent
more killings.


On Wednesday, Rogelio Illustrisimo, a mayoral candidate in the
May 14 mid-term elections, was gunned down in the central
Philippine province of Cebu.
