Stephen Maguire and fellow Scot John Higgins were all square at
4-4 in their semi-final clash at the snooker World Championships
here on Thursday.


Maguire raced to a 3-1 lead, knocking in breaks of 85, 102 and 79
but Higgins fought back with breaks of 113 and 68 to draw level
at 3-3 before the next two frames were shared.


The other semi-final, an all English affair, saw 2005 champion
Shaun Murphy lead Mark Selby 5-3 at the end of Friday's evening
session at the Crucible Theatre.


Murphy owes his presence in the last four to a stirring comeback
in the quarter- finals when he recovered from 12-7 down to beat
Matthew Stevens 13-12.


And the 24-year-old seemed determine to avoid having to perform
similar heroics against qualifier Selby by racing into a 5-1 lead
in the best-of-33 frame showdown at the Crucible Theatre.


But Selby served notice that he can still pose a threat in a
match which will span three days by taking the final two frames
of the session.
