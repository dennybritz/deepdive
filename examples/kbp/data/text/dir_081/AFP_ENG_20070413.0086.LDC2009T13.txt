New Zealand share prices closed 0.09 percent lower Friday,
dragged down by uncertainty over the impact of regulatory changes
affecting market leader Telecom, dealers said.


The benchmark NZX-50 index was 3.8 points down at 4,164.30 on
turnover worth 120.23 million dollars (87.64 million US).


Telecom fell 13 cents to 4.74 dollars, a day after an 18 percent
rise on news the government will re-auction certain broadcast
spectrum rights.


Brokers said there was uncertainty over the size of a promised
capital return and Telecom's offer to spin off its copper wire
network rather than accept the latest regulatory proposal.


Telecom's statement had been "reasonably aggressive," and there
were fears of a stalemate with the regulator, said Goldman Sachs
JB Were broker Jeremy Coe.


"There's lots for investors to sort through and nothing clear on
the table yet."


Elsewhere, Fletcher Building climbed 24 cents to 11.48 after
indicating it was looking at buying a business for between 700
and 800 million dollars within the next year.


Contact Energy gained five cents to 9.05, Auckland Airport nosed
up three cents to 2.43, and the Warehouse gained two cents to
7.17.


The Fisher and Paykel Healthcare rose two cents to 3.68 dollars
while its sister company Fisher and Paykel Appliances was down
three cents at 3.62.
