More than 35 Taliban insurgents were killed during a five-hour
battle with US- led and Afghan troops in a bitterly contested
area of southern Afghanistan, the US-led coalition said Friday.


The fighting on Thursday took place in the Sangin district of
Helmand province, which around 1,000 Afghan and international
troops wrested from insurgent control at the weekend.


"More than 35 Taliban fighters were killed by ANA (Afghan
National Army) and coalition forces during the five-hour
afternoon battle," the coalition said in a statement.
