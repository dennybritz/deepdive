Israeli parliament speaker and acting president Dalia Yitzik will
travel to Amman in Jordan next week to meet King Abdullah II, her
spokesman said on Friday.


"Mrs Yitzik is due to visit Amman at the end of next week at the
invitation of the Hashemite sovereign," Ilan Osfeld told AFP,
declining to name the exact date of the trip.


"During the one-day visit, Mrs Yitzik will be accompanied by the
chief of parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee,
Tsahi Hanegbi, and several other committee members," he said.


According to a report in the mass-circulation Yediot Aharonot
daily, their visit is due to touch on talks being mediated by
Egypt for a Palestinian prisoner exchange in return for an
Israeli soldier seized by Gaza-based militants last June.


Yitzik's trip will follow talks between Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Sunday --
the first of a string of regular meetings announced by visiting
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice last month.
