The US military said on Friday that only one civilian had been
killed in an explosion at Iraq's parliament building, revising
down its initial estimate of eight dead.


"Yesterday we said eight killed. That was from multiple sources.
What we're saying is, we can only confirm one was killed," a US
military official quoted spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher
Garver as saying.


"We're going from what was reported to what was confirmed today,"
he added.


Iraqi parliamentarians told a special session convened on Friday,
one day after the attack, that one lawmaker was killed in the
blast.
