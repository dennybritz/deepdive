Workers at the Heineken brewery in the western Russian city of
Saint Petersburg went on strike Friday over wages, the union at
the Dutch-owned company said.


"Since 8:00 am Friday, we have launched an unlimited protest
movement," the union boss at the site, Valery Sokolov, told AFP.


He said 370 of the 480 workers had joined the walkout to demand a
30 percent hike in salaries.


The workers are carrying out minimum production levels, as
stipulated in their contracts, Sokolov said.


The average monthly salary at the brewery is around 20,000 rubles
(760 dollars, 560 euros), the union said.
