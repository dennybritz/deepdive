A radical Muslim cleric and two of his followers were killed
Friday by unknown assailants in a mosque in a suburb of the
northern Nigerian city of Kano, witnesses said.


Followers of Jaafar Adam, a Wahhabi cleric, said the killing was
political, ahead of the weekend elections for governors and
legislators for the country's 36 states.
