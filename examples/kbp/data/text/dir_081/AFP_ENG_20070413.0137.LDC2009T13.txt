The euro rose to 1.3534 dollars on Friday in early European
trading, reaching the highest level since January 3, 2005 on
expectations of rising eurozone interest rates, dealers said.


The single currency later stood at 1.3523 dollars, compared with
1.3480 dollars late on Thursday.


The euro had breached 1.35 dollars on Thursday after the European
Central Bank (ECB) signalled that it was ready to raise eurozone
borrowing costs again in June.


ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sent a clear signal that the
bank was set to raise its key interest rates -- already at a
five-and-a-half-year high -- still further in June, after holding
rates at 3.75 percent on Thursday.


"The dollar has been depressed against the euro by the comments
of President Trichet yesterday following the monetary policy
meeting of the European Central Bank," said Paul Chertkow, head
of global currency research at The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in
London.


"Characterising monetary policy as still accommodative, he
(Trichet) underpinned the expectation of another 0.25 point
increase in the refinancing rate in the eurozone before mid-
year."
