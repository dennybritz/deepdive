South Korea will draw up a plan by the end of June to withdraw
its troops from Iraq, the defence ministry said Friday.


"We plan to draw up a plan and submit it to parliament to
terminate the mission in Iraq," a spokesman said.


"The details of the withdrawal plan have not yet been fixed,
including the timetable for the pullout," he told AFP.


South Korea in 2004 sent around 3,500 troops to Iraq, the third-
largest foreign contingent after the United States and Britain.
The size of the force has been progressively cut amid domestic
opposition to the deployment.


Currently, it has 1,300 troops stationed in the northern Kurdish
region around Irbil.


Visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told journalists on
Thursday that South Korea will be able to withdraw as many troops
as it wants beginning next month after Iraqi forces take over
security in the region.
