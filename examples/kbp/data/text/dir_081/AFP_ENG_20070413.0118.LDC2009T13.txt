Hong Kong share prices closed 0.19 percent weaker Friday as
investors locked in profits in property stocks amid an uncertain
outlook for interest rates, dealers said.


They said trading was also cautious ahead of key inflation data
in the US and a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central
bankers this weekend.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 39.24 points at 20,340.97, off a
low of 20,264.99 and a high of 20,432.01. For the week, the index
was up 131.26 points or 0.65 percent. Turnover was 57.19 billion
Hong Kong dollars (7.3 billion US).
