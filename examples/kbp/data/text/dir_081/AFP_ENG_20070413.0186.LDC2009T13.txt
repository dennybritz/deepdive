Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson will soon
make his stocky presence felt in India's Bollywood cinema.


Bollywood producer Firoz Nadiadwala, who produced one of last
year's biggest hits "Phir Hera Pheri" (More Fraud) is all set to
finalise a deal with Tyson to star in a promotional video for his
upcoming film "Fool-n-Final."


The action-comedy is to be directed by choreographer-turned-
director Ahmed Khan and will star well-known Bollywood actors
such as Sunny Deol, Suniel Shetty and Shahid Kapoor.


"We are in talks with Tyson. Some paperwork is left for the deal
to be absolutely complete," Khan said, adding Tyson would
commence a three-day shoot in India April 20 onwards.


Tyson will play a part in a promotional song composed by popular
Indian  music director and singer Himesh Reshammiya.


Tyson rose to fame as the youngest world champion heavyweight in
history, and in his prime was considered unbeatable.


But the troubled boxer, who once styled himself the "baddest man
on the planet," was banned from the ring for a year for biting
Evander Holyfield's ear during a 1997 fight and has served three
years of a six-year sentence after his 1992 conviction for the
rape of a beauty queen in an Indianopolis hotel room.


He is also scheduled to stand trial over drug charges in a US
court in August.
