Newcomers Gold Coast Titans upstaged National Rugby League
champions Brisbane Broncos 28-16 for their third win of the
season Friday.


The Titans blasted the Broncos with five tries to three for an
impressive victory before a 47,686-strong crowd of mostly Titans
supporters at Lang Park in the all-Queensland derby match.


Gold Coast led 12-0 after two tries in as many minutes before the
Broncos cut the deficit to 12-6 by halftime.


The Titans blew their lead out to 22-6 by the 58th minute after
centre Brett Delaney completed a try-scoring double, and led
28-12 before the Broncos reduced the margin with a try in the
final minutes.


Brisbane have now won just one of their opening four premiership
games.


Parramatta claimed their third straight win with a 27-14 victory
over local rivals Penrith.


The Eels prevailed after coming from behind to post a strong
four-tries-to-two win, fullback Luke Burt the star with two tries
and five goals.


Parramatta sealed their win with backrower Ian Hindmarsh landing
the first drop goal of his career to lead 21-14 before scoring a
powerful try in the final minutes.
