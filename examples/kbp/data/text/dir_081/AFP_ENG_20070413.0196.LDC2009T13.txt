France Telecom might make a counter bid for  Olimpia, the holding
company that owns 18 percent of Telecom Italia, the daily Il Sole
24 Ore said on Friday.


The possible bid comes as talks between the tyre group Pirelli,
which owns Olimpia with the apparel maker Benetton, and American
giant AT&T and its Mexican affiliate America Movil have run
into difficulties, it said.


The French operator, in collaboration with an American bank, is
preparing a proposal under which it would take a majority
shareholding in Olimpia and apply an industrial plan, the
newspaper said, without revealing its source.


Spain's Telefonica is also eyeing Olimpia and its Telecom Italia
stake, according to Italian press reports.


Il Sole 24 Ore said that AT&T and the Mexican America Movil
were worried about the future of the Telecom Italia's fixed line
network, which the government wants to open up to all operators.


They also have problems with Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo which
wants to take a 34-percent stake in Olimpia to guarantee the
"Italianness" of the operator but is also insisting on influence
over the governance of the group.
