A Sri Lankan stylist has told how he took two days to create the
bleached-blond hairdo helping Sri Lankan bowler Lasith Malinga
attract attention at the Cricket World Cup.


"Malinga likes to stand out, so he goes for unusual styles unlike
the other well-known cricketers," said hairdresser Nishantha
Jayasekera, who runs the Le Paris salon in Panadura near Colombo
and counts several other Sri Lanka cricketers among his clients.


"Malinga has his own hair ideas and he is not afraid to try out
anything new," he said, adding, "It took me two days to get the
look."


The barber told the latest edition of the Rivira weekly newspaper
Malinga wanted a new style each time he went on tour and he has
so far tried out five different hairstyles on the 23-year-old
paceman.


But he said he never expected his latest unkempt light blond look
-- created specially for the World Cup in the Caribbean -- to
become an instant hit.


Malinga, who also sports a silver eyebrow ring, had flirted with
the idea of a "mohawk," shaved sides with a thin strip of hair in
the middle, he said.


Besides Malinga, Jayasekera also grooms spin bowler Tillakaratne
Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Malinga Bandara and Hashan Tilakaratne.
