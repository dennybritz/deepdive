The United States expects to reach a "meaningful agreement" with
China by May on the liberalisation of aviation, the US secretary
of transportation said Friday.


"We want to reach meaningful agreement about having full and open
liberalisation of aviation," Mary Peters told a gathering of US
businesspeople in Beijing.


"That is our goal, and I do believe that we can reach a
meaningful agreement by May at the next SED (Strategic Economic
Dialogue)," she said.


The Strategic Economic Dialogue is a twice-annual high-level
meeting. The next round of talks between US Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson and Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi is scheduled in
Washington next month.


Although an agreement of complete liberalisation of aviation is
the ultimate goal, Peters said the agreement with China would
probably be phased in over a period of time.


During her first visit as Transportation Secretary to Beijing,
Peters will meet with high-ranking Chinese aviation officials
including Yang Yuanyuan, the minister of General Administration
of Civil Aviation.


The two countries reached an aviation agreement in 2004, which
covered an increase in the number of airlines serving US-China
routes, an expansion of flights frequency and the establishment
of cargo hubs in China by US airlines.


"There is no better time than the present to build on this
foundation by opening the skies between China and the United
States," Peters said.
