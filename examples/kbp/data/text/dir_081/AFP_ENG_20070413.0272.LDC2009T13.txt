Argentine football idol Diego Maradona is in "good" health, said
medics on Friday at the hospital where he was admitted after
suffering from abdominal pains.


Maradona's "general health is good," hospital director Oscar Sico
told reporters.


"It could be his pancreas, it could be ulcers; we don't know. But
he does not show signs of any other illness," he said.


The football legend was rushed early in the morning for emergency
treatment after reporting severe abdominal pain.


Sico said Maradona could spend two or three days in the hospital,
but said he was stable and that doctors had "eased his pain."


Just two days earlier, the 46-year-old was released from a
different facility for treatment of hepatitis and other effects
of alcohol abuse.


The former captain of Argentina's winning World Cup side and star
for Barcelona and Napoli spent 13 days in the hospital from late
March to be treated for excessive drinking which sparked a return
of chronic hepatitis, which he has suffered for years.
