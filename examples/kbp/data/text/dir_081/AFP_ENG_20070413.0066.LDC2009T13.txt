Australian share prices closed down 0.37 percent Friday as
investors took profits after the market hit record levels during
the week, dealers said.


Increased speculation of a rise in official interest rates also
weighed on sentiment, they said.


The key SP/ASX 200 fell 22.5 points to 6,135.7 while the broader
All Ordinaries dropped 19.0 points to 6,123.8.
