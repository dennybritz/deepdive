Iraq's parliament on Friday began a special session with very few
MPs in attendance to condemn a suicide bombing inside its canteen
that killed eight people and wounded 23, state television showed.


The session started with a recitation of prayers from the Koran
before the speaker Mahmud Mashhadani addressed the gathering.


Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani was also seen among the group
of MPs attending the session.
