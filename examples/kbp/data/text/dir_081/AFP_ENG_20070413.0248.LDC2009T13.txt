French President Jacques Chirac called his Afghan counterpart
Hamid Karzai to demand his support for efforts to free two French
aid workers kidnapped 10 days ago, Karzai's office said Friday.


"President Chirac during a telephone conversation last night
demanded the Afghan president's support to secure the release of
two French nationals," Karzai's office said in a statement.


"The president in response assured that all relevant Afghan
authorities will do their utmost to secure their release," it
said, without giving any further details.


The French aid workers, from the non-governmental organisation
Terre d'Enfance (A World for Our Children), went missing on April
3 in the southwestern province of Nimroz.


The Islamist Taliban militia say they are holding the pair, a man
and a woman, along with three of their Afghan colleagues.


Concerns have mounted for their safety since the Taliban said on
Sunday that they had beheaded an Afghan reporter whom they
kidnapped with an Italian journalist a month ago in the southern
province of Helmand.


Ajmal Naqshbandi was killed after Karzai's administration failed
to negotiate with the Taliban. However, Italian reporter Daniele
Mastrogiacomo was freed in a hostage deal that saw five militants
released from Afghan jails.


Karzai was criticised both within and outside Afghanistan for his
controversial deal and has said that his government will not
repeat the hostage trade with the Taliban.
