EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana has condemned the deadly
suicide bombing in the Iraqi parliament building, describing it
as an act of "extreme violence".


The bomber on Thursday detonated an explosive belt, killing eight
people including at least two Iraqi lawmakers and a parliamentary
official.


"I firmly condemn the terrorist attack," Solana said in a
statement.


"This new act of extreme violence against the symbol of the
sovereignty of the Iraqi people shows once more that all efforts
must be made to put an end to the cycle of violence that is
causing so much suffering to the Iraqi people".


Solana conveyed his condolences to the families of the victims
and to the Iraqi authorities.


The Iraqi parliament was to hold a special session on Friday to
condemn the bombing inside its canteen which also wounded 23
people.
