A NATO soldier was killed in a firefight with Taliban militants
Friday, becoming the 12th foreign soldier to die in southern
Afghanistan in less than a week, the alliance said.


Two other soldiers were injured in the battle and taken to a
medical facility for treatment, the NATO-led International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in a statement.


"An ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) soldier died
as a result of a firefight in southern Afghanistan," the
statement said.


It did not give any other details about the location of the
incident or the nationality of the victims.


The latest death brought to 40 the number of international troops
killed in Afghanistan this year. Some 170 were killed there in
2006.


It comes a day after two NATO soldiers were killed in separate
explosions 30 minutes apart in southern Afghanistan. Their
nationalities have also not been released.


On April 8, Easter Sunday, Canada suffered its heaviest single-
day troop loss in 50 years with the death of six soldiers outside
Kandahar. A US soldier was killed in a similar incident the same
day.


Some 37,000 ISAF troops drawn from 37 nations are in Afghanistan
along with 11,000 US-led coalition soldiers to counter a bloody
insurgency led by the ultra-Islamic Taliban militia.
