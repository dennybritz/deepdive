French President Jacques Chirac called his Afghan counterpart
Hamid Karzai to demand his support for efforts to free two French
aid workers kidnapped 10 days ago, Karzai's office said Friday.


"President Chirac during a telephone conversation last night
demanded the Afghan president's support to secure the release of
two French nationals," Karzai's office said in a statement.


"The president in response assured that all relevant Afghan
authorities will do their utmost to secure their release," it
said.


The French aid workers from the non-governmental organisation
Terre d'Enfance (A World for Our Children) went missing on April
3 in the southwestern province of Nimroz.


The Islamist Taliban militia says it is holding the pair, a man
and a woman, along with three of their Afghan colleagues.
