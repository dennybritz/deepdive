Brussels Airport was practically shut down on Friday morning due
to a strike by firefighters, an airport spokesman said.


"Except for small planes the airport is practically shut down,"
spokesman Jan Van der Cruysse told AFP.


"Most flights have been cancelled and those due to arrive in
Brussels have been re-routed to other Belgian, French or Dutch
airports, according to the airlines," he added.


Talks were underway between management and union, he said,
without explaining the nature of the dispute, adding that an
agreement was expected to be reached quickly.


In the meantime Brussels Airport advised passengers to contact
airlines for details of flight changes and cancellations expected
throughout the morning after the strike action began at 6:00 am
(0400 GMT).
