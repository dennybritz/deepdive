The number of Japanese companies operating in India has increased
by nearly 50 percent in a year, drawn by an improved investment
climate, according to a report on Friday.


"The number (of Japanese companies) that stood at 320 last
January (2006) crossed 470 in February this year," Japanese
Ambassador to India Y. Enoki was quoted as saying by the Press
Trust of India.


Japanese companies were flocking to Indian shores because of an
increasingly attractive investment climate in the country where
economic growth is running at around nine percent, the ambassador
said.


India has been liberalising its economy, drawing a growing number
of foreign investors from around the world.
