Sales of chicken in Kuwait have dropped by around 40 percent
since an outbreak of bird flu was announced in February, the
official KUNA news agency said on Friday.


The Gulf state has culled about 1.7 million birds since
confirming the outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu that is
dangerous to humans. A total of 106 cases of the strain have so
far been confirmed in birds.


Industry sources told KUNA total daily sales of products in each
of its outlets fluctuated now between 150 and 175 dinars (363 and
605 dollars), compared to around 250 and 300 dinars before the
outbreak.


KUNA said that sales of imported chicken, meanwhile, had risen by
15 percent since February.


Since the outbreak, 22 people have been admitted to hospital on
suspicion of being infected, but all have been discharged after
tests for the virus proved negative.


In November 2005, the Gulf state announced the first case of a
bird infected with the H5N1 strain -- a flamingo at a seaside
villa.


The H5N1 strain, the most aggressive form, has killed 171 people
worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation, and has
seen millions of birds destroyed.
