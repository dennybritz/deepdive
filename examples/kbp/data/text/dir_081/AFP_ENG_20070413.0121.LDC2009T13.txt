Swiss reinsurer Converium on Friday urged shareholders to reject
a takeover by French rival Scor, warning of a potential loss of
up to 800 million dollars (592 million euros) for the company.


"After careful consideration of Scor's offer, we urge our
shareholders to place their confidence in our management's
detailed and credible plan for sustainable future value
creation," said Converium board chairman Markus Dennler.


Scor's bid "entails significant business and integration risks in
terms of staff and customer retention which could mean a loss of
up to 800 million dollars in premium income," Converium added in
a statement.


Scor is offering 0.5 of its own shares and four Swiss francs in
cash, for each Converium share.


The French group already holds 32.9 percent of its Swiss peer.
