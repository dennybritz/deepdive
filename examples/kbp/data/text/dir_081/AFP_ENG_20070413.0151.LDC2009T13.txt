Zimbabwean authorities have again postponed the release of
inflation figures to a later date, an official said Friday.


"We had told people to check today (Friday), but there are some
issues that are still to be finalised," said a senior official
from the Central Statistical Office(CSO) who refused to be named.


"Maybe next week we might be ready."


The figures were initially meant to be released on Wednesday
afternoon, but the CSO postponed the release to Friday citing a
"few technical hitches" as the reason.


Analysts predict that the rate of inflation, already the highest
in the world at 1,730 percent, may pass the 2,000 percent mark
when the figure is released.


The International Monetary Fund has said inflation will end the
year at 4,000 percent.
