An Iraqi woman and child were killed on Friday in the capital's
latest roadside bomb attack that targeted a police patrol, a
security official said.


Four policemen were also wounded in the attack in the southern
Zafaraniyah district of the capital where tens of thousands of
Iraqi and US troops have pressed a last-ditch military crackdown
for two months.


A medical source at the Ibn al-Nafis hospital said doctors
received the body of a woman and admitted four wounded men
following the blast.


The attack came one day after a suicide bomber killed eight
people inside the Iraqi parliament canteen in the most
spectacular breach of security in the heavily fortified Green
Zone, that houses the seat of the Iraqi government.
