Iraq's parliament will begin a special session on Friday at
around 2:00 pm (1000 GMT) to condemn a suicide bombing inside its
canteen that killed eight and wounded 23, a lawmaker said.


"The parliament will definitely meet at around 2:00 pm," Mithal
al-Alusi, an Arab Sunni secular MP told AFP.


Alusi said the session would begin in the afternoon, on what is
the Muslim day of rest, as most parliamentarians were "busy
meeting the wounded victims and families of those killed in the
bomb attack."


On Thursday, a suicide bomber blew himself up inside the
parliament's canteen just after lunchtime, killing eight,
including at least two MPs.


The attack was the deadliest inside the heavily fortified Green
Zone since the US-led invasion of the country and amounted to the
most staggering breach of security inside the area that is home
to the seat of government.


On Thursday, the assembly's Sunni speaker Mahmud Mashhadani told
state television that the parliament would meet on Friday to
condemn the bombing.
