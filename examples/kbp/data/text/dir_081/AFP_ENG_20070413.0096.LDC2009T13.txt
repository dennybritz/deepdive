Deutsche Telekom hopes to find a partner for its IT services unit
T-Systems "as quickly as possible," board member Lothar Pauly
said in a newspaper interview Friday.


"We're not under any time pressure. But a solution should be
found as quickly as possible so as not to engender uncertainty
for customers and employees," Pauly told the daily Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung.


"But you won't get any concrete timetable out of me at the
moment."


In particular, Deutsche Telekom is looking for a partner for
T-Systems' enterprise services division, which provides IT
services to big multi-national companies and public sector
clients.


The business accounts for two thirds of T-Systems' total annual
sales of 12.6 billion euros (17 billion dollars) and its
55,000-strong workforce.


Pauly insisted that a straightforward sale of the business "is
not an option," but Deutsche Telekom would not insist on
maintaining a majority stake.


"That's not been decided yet," he said. "We don't want to
restrict our choices in our search for a partner by insisting on
a majority stake. But it is important for us that we maintain a
significant stake in the new company," Pauly said.


In the past, French groups Atos Origin and CapGemini and US-based
EDS have all been mooted as possible partners for T-Systems.
