The US pointman on North Korea's nuclear programme gave a guarded
response on Friday to Pyongyang's promise to start scrapping its
nuclear programme once a sanctions dispute was resolved.


"I heard that about a month ago," Hill told reporters on arrival
in Beijing when asked about the North's statement that it would
begin disarming once it could confirm 25 million dollars frozen
in a Macau bank had been released.


Asked whether he hoped North Korea would begin the disarmament
process by a Saturday deadline as agreed under a six-nation
brokered deal in February, Hill was reluctant to disclose his
expectations.


"That's up to them. I'm not hoping for anything," he said.


The North's foreign ministry, in a statement carried by official
media, said on Friday it would "confirm soon" whether its funds
in the Macau bank had been unfrozen.


Once North Korea confirmed the money had been released, it would
abide by the February agreement, the statement said.


Hill flew in from Seoul for discussions with officials from
China, which is host of the six-party process that began in 2003
with the aim of convincing North Korea to abandon its nuclear
ambitions.


Hill did not say which Chinese officials he intended to meet or
how long he would stay. The US embassy's media office was unable
to clarify.


But before he left Seoul, Hill said he would be willing to meet
his North Korean counterpart to the talks, Kim Kye-Gwan, in
Beijing if Kim requested it.
