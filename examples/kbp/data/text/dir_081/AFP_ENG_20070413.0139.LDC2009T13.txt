Police said Friday that two teenage boys have been charged with
the murder of a 14-year-old boy in London, whose killing
reignited fears of a gun and knife culture among youths in the
city.


The two, aged 17 and 15, were charged following the death of Paul
Erhahon, who was stabbed in the heart in the foyer of a tower
block in Leytonstone, northeast London, Friday evening.


The move brings to four the number of teenagers charged over his
killing.


The pair also face allegations of attempted murder and grievous
bodily harm in relation to a 15-year-old friend of Erhahon who
was seriously injured in the attack.


The dead boy, who was found in the street by his mother, is the
eighth teenager to be killed in London in the last three months.
Five were stabbed and three shot.


Erhahon went to the same east London school as Adam Regis, a 15
-year-old who was stabbed to death last month.


Some campaigners have said that the recent spate of violence
shows that knife and gun crime in some parts of the British
capital is out of control.


But Prime Minister Tony Blair, while admitting there is a
"specific problem within a specific criminal culture", rejects
claims that violent crime is on the increase.


His government is considering a package of measures to tackle the
situation, including giving greater protection to people who give
evidence against gang members in court.
