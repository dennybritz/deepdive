Nordex, the German maker of wind turbines, said Friday that it
had won the biggest-ever contract in its history, which could
amount to more than 700 million euros (945 million dollars).


Nordex said in a statement it had signed an agreement with
investment firm Babcock & Brown to deliver wind turbines with
a total capacity of up to 640 megawatts between 2008 and 2011.


Initially, Nordex would deliver 120 turbines with a combined
capacity of 289 megawatts to be installed in wind parks in
Portugal and France.


In addition, the contract included options for a further 100
turbines and additional projects in France, the statement said.
