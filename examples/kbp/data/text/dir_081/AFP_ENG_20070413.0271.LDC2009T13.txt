A Sri Lankan stylist took two days to create Sri Lankan bowler
Lasith Malinga's bleached-blond unkept hair that is attracting
attention at the Cricket World Cup.


Hair dresser Nishantha Jayasekera said Malinga wanted a new style
each time he went on tour. So the locks were spruced up for the
World Cup in the Caribbean.


"Malinga has his own hair ideas and he is not afraid to try out
anything new," said Jayasekera who runs the Le Paris salon in
Panadura, 25 kilometers (15.6 miles) south of Colombo.


The barber told the latest edition of the Rivira weekly newspaper
he has so far tried out five different hair styles on the 23-year
old paceman, but never expected his "light blond" creation to
become an instant hit.


"It took me two days to get the look," Jayasekera said.


Malinga, who also sports a silver eyebrow ring, had flirted with
the idea of a "mohawk" that would have shaved the sides leaving a
thin strip of hair in the middle.


Besides Malinga, Jayasekera also grooms spin bowler Tillakaratne
Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Malinga Bandara and Hashan Tilakaratne.


"Malinga likes to stand out, so he goes for unusual styles unlike
the other well-known cricketers," Jayasekera said.


Sri Lankans usually apply coconut oil on their hair to hold the
hair in place instead of using more expensive gel.
