The price of Brent North Sea crude struck a seven-month high of
69.59 dollars a barrel in early London trading Friday on concerns
that current oil supplies may not meet demand, traders said.


Brent North Sea crude for May delivery later stood at 69.20
dollars per barrel in London electronic trading, up 48 cents from
Thursday's close.


Crude futures had swung higher on Wednesday after the US
Department of Energy said that gasoline, or petrol, reserves
slumped last week by much more than expected, ahead of the peak
demand season for motor fuel.


Inventories of US gasoline plunged by 5.5 million barrels to
199.7 million in the week to April 6. Analysts had forecast a
lighter drop of 1.4 million barrels.


Gasoline stockpiles are a crucial focus for the market ahead of
the so-called US driving season that starts next month and sees
many Americans take to their cars for their holidays.


Meanwhile the International Energy Agency warned on Thursday that
the OPEC oil producers' group might have cut its production too
much, with insufficient current output eroding world stock
levels.


The 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
decided to cut its production twice at the end of last year to
help support prices that were falling at the time.
