A North Korean official told AFP on Friday there was no reason to
be "pessimistic" about the fate of a six-nation nuclear accord,
saying Pyongyang will respect its commitments once a row on funds
is resolved.


Under the breakthrough February 13 deal, North Korea has until
Saturday to start shutting down its nuclear reactor.


"There is no reason to be pessimistic. We will be faithful to
this agreement if the Americans respect its clauses," Kim Son-
gyong, deputy director of the foreign ministry's European
department, told AFP in Pyongyang.


"We will respect our commitment as it is written in the February
13 agreement. No more and no less," he said.
