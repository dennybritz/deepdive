A young Cambodian girl was killed and two of her relatives
seriously hurt when a rocket they were trying to salvage for
scrap metal detonated, police said Friday.


The blast happened Thursday when the 13-year-old girl tried to
break open the rocket with a metal pipe, said Ly Sovan, police
chief of Udong district, some 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the
capital Phnom Penh where the accident occurred.


The girl's mother and seven-year-old brother who had been
searching for scrap material with her, were also badly hurt in
the explosion, Ly Sovan said.


"The girl suddenly hit the rocket ... and it exploded. She was
killed and her body smashed and scattered around," he said.


Cambodia is struggling to recover from nearly three decades of
conflict which only formally ended in 1998. Millions of mines and
other pieces of ordnance are still strewn across the country.


Organised mine clearing efforts began in 1992 and 252 square
kilometres have so far been cleared. Intensive public education
campaigns have also dramatically reduced the number of mine
casualties.


But roughly 2,900 square kilometres of mine-infested land
remains, while extreme poverty forces many to try to salvage the
deadly munitions for small amounts of money.
