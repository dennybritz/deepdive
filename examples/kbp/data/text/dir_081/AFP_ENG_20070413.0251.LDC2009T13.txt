A tax row between cigarette companies and vendors in southern
India may force smokers to go cold turkey with shopkeepers
planning to halt cigarette sales from Monday.


Shopkeepers want cigarette manufacturers to absorb a 12.5 percent
value-added- tax imposed by the Communist-led government in the
southern state of Kerala from April 1. But the companies have
refused to do so.


"From April 16 onwards, no shops will sell cigarettes in the
state. We have taken the decision to register our protest," said
T. Naseeruddin, head of the United Business and Traders
Association, representing shops in the state of around 30 million
people.


A packet of 10 cigarettes of popular brand Wills sells for 34
rupees (80 cents) here.


The head of the state traders association said profit margins
will drop drastically if the vendors bear the costs of the new
tax, which will leave them only a 10-paise profit on each pack of
cigarettes sold, he said.


"The majority of the shopkeepers are poor and if the profit
margin is very low, why should we sell it?" asked Naseerudin.


The decision, to take effect from Monday, has already resulted in
the shortage of popular brands with smokers stockpiling their
favourite cigarettes.


"I have stocked my brand for 10 days. I don't think that the
traders will continue their protest indefinitely," said Thomas
John, a chain smoker in Thiruvananthapuram, who had bought 144
packs of Wills.
