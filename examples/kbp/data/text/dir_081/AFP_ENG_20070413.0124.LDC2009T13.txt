A bomb exploded at the campaign office of the governor of the
southwest Nigerian state of Ondo, damaging a section of the
building but no one was hurt, the police said Friday.


"The bomb blast occurred on Thursday and partly damaged the
campaign office of Governor Olusegun Agagu in Akure," state
deputy commissioner of police Joseph Awelewa told AFP.


He said no one was injured, but added that investigation was
under way into the incident, coming barely one day before the
state governorship and parliamentarian vote in Nigeria.


Agagu is seeking re-election into the office he won in May 2003.


Awelewas said the four-storey building on Oyemekun road in the
state capital was partly destroyed by the explosion which also
shattered the sliding windows and doors of the building.


Tensions are rising ahead of Saturday's poll.


More than 100 people have died in election-related violence
across Nigeria since November last year, according to a recent
report by the New York-based rights watchdog Human Rights Watch.


Local media also report daily election-related killings across
the country, Africa's most populous nation and top oil producer.


A radical Muslim cleric and two of his followers were killed
Friday by unknown assailants in a mosque in a suburb of the
northern Nigerian city of Kano, witnesses said.


Followers of Jaafar Adam, a Wahhabi cleric, said the killing was
political, but the police could not immediately confirm the
incident.
