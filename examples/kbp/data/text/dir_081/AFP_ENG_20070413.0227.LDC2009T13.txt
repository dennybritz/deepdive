Ireland's unemployment rate eased to 4.2 percent in March, from
4.3 percent in February, official figures showed Friday.


The number of people signing on for benefits on the state's Live
Register in March dropped by 3,530 compared to February, the
Central Statistics Office (CSO) said.


This brought the total number signing on to 155,869.


The number signing on rose by 326 in March compared to the same
month in 2006.


On a seasonally adjusted basis, the number signing on dropped by
300 during the month. On an annual basis, the seasonally adjusted
figure rose by 300, the CSO added.


The Live Register is not designed to be a fully accurate measure
of unemployment as it includes part-time workers and casual staff
entitled to benefits.
