A blogger in northern Russia who wrote that police deserve to be
publicly burned faces a hate crimes probe, the first to target
blogging in Russia, the Kommersant daily reported Friday.


Prosecutors in the northern city of Syktyvkar, in the Komi
province, have opened a criminal investigation against Savva
Terentyev, 21, who on February 15 posted an entry on a web log
hosted by the popular website livejournal.com, the newspaper
reported.


Terentyev wrote that police are "filth," "the most stupid,
uneducated representatives of the living (animal) world,"
according to a photograph of what Kommersant said was his
message.


Terentyev allegedly went on to recommend that six police in every
city be "ceremonially burned daily, or better twice a day (at
midday and midnight, for example)."


The ovens should be like those at the Nazi concentration camp of
Auschwitz, he allegedly said.


If found guilty of "stirring up hatred" he faces two years in
prison or a fine of 300,000 rubles (11,620 dollars, 8,600 euros).


The blog belongs to local journalist Boris Suranov who was
describing a raid by police to search the offices of the
opposition newspaper Iskra, Kommersant reported.
