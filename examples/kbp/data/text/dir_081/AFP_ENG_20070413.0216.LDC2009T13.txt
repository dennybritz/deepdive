Nine out of 10 Filipinos want publicly funded birth control
despite strong opposition from the influential Roman Catholic
church, an independent survey showed Friday.


The Pulse Asia survey of 1,800 adults found 89 percent wanted the
government to pay for family planning measures including
medication, intra-uterine devices, condoms, ligation and
vasectomies.


Almost all Filipinos surveyed (92 percent) described family
planning as important, with five percent undecided and only two
percent saying it was unimportant.


Leaders of the Catholic church, the religion of 81 percent of the
Philippine population, condemn birth control.


According to the survey, 76 percent said candidates in mid-term
elections next month should address family planning concerns,
with 75 percent pledging to support those willing to fund such
measures.


Voters will elect half of the 24-member Philippine Senate, the
entire 250-member House of Representatives and thousands of local
officials from mayors to governors on May 14.


The survey was carried out between February 28 and March 5.
