China urged the Italian government Friday to safeguard the rights
of overseas Chinese in Milan after clashes between police and the
Asian community erupted in a "sidewalk revolt."


"We hope that the Italian side can fairly handle this matter,
earnestly consider the reasonable demands of the overseas Chinese
people and fully safeguard their legal rights," foreign ministry
spokesman Qin Gang said.


Both the Chinese foreign ministry and its consulate generale in
Milan have raised representations with the Italian government, he
said in a statement.


About 15 people were injured in Milan during Thursday's clashes
that involved hundreds of residents of the northern city's
Chinatown over a parking ticket, Italian media reported.


A shopkeeper of Chinese origin was loudly protesting a fine of 40
euros (54 dollars) for parking illegally when a crowd gathered
that swelled to around 350, according to the all-news channel Sky
TG24.


Dozens of police were deployed as the situation degenerated into
running battles that left 15 injured including 11 police
officers, Sky said.


The violence produced banner headlines in Friday newspapers
across Italy decrying a "sidewalk revolt" that broke out over a
parking ticket.


"Milan: Revolt of the City Within the City," wrote Italy's
leading daily Corriere della Sera over dramatic photographs of
running battles that broke out between police and hundreds of
Chinese youths.
