Authorities in Indian Kashmir announced Friday the launch of a
drive to destroy hemp and poppy plantations and threatened
narcotics growers with ten years' imprisonment.


"We have decided to form special squads within a week to check
cultivation of hemp and poppy crops," senior government official
Basharat Ahmed said.


"Anyone found involved in cultivation of these crops would be
awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment," said Ahmed, the
divisional commissioner of the Muslim- dominated Kashmir valley.


A similar drive was carried out last year in villages in the
south of Kashmir, but it had a very little impact.


"For many villagers, last year's destruction has not served as a
deterrent," a police officer who wished not to be named told AFP
from southern town of Awantipora.


"But the warning that cultivators will have to spend ten years in
jail is definitely going to help," he said.


The official statement said the government would also organise
"awareness camps" in the Kashmir valley advising people not to
cultivate hemp -- from which cannabis comes -- and poppy which
produces opium.


Many villagers grow poppy for the seeds, used to flavour the
traditional Kashmiri bread known as kulcha.


The state is reeling from 17 years of separatist violence that
has claimed tens of thousands of lives. However, officials have
found no connection between Islamic militants waging an
insurgency against Indian rule and poppy cultivators.
