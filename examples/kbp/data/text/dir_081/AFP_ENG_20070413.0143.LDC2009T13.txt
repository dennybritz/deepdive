Factories and refineries in the 13 nations sharing the euro
cranked up production slightly more than expected in February
after a soft patch in January, official EU data showed on Friday.


Industrial output in the eurozone rose 0.6 percent in February
over January and 4.1 percent over 12 months, according to figures
from the European Union's Eurostat data agency.


The result, which was adjusted for seasonal variations, slightly
exceeded private economists' forecasts for a rise of 0.4 percent
over one month and was in line with expectations for the 12-month
increase.


It also marked an improvement from January when production fell
0.5 percent over one month and rose 3.4 percent over one year,
Eurostat said in a downward revision to its initial estimates
made last month.


Production was broadly stronger in February although the energy
industry and manufacturers of capital goods, which are used by
businesses to make other goods, saw particularly firm output.


Both industries saw their production rise 0.8 percent over one
month.


In the 27-nation EU as a whole, industrial output rose 0.5
percent in February over one month and 4.0 percent over one year.
