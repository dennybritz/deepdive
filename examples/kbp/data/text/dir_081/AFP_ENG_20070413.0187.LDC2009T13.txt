Morocco risks attacks similar to the "odious terrorist" bombings
that struck Algeria, King Mohammed VI warned in a message Friday
to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.


"We believe that your sister nation, Morocco, is also among the
targets...", the king said in the message of condolence over
Wednesday's suicide bombings in Algiers.


"We are convinced that the security of our neighbour, our sister
Algeria, is an integral part of the security of Morocco, even the
stability of the Maghreb region and in a wider sense of North
Africa, of the southwestern Mediterranean and the Sahel and
Sahara regions," he said.


Two suicide car bombings in Algiers on Wednesday killed 33 people
and injured more than 220. They were claimed by Al-Qaeda's branch
in North Africa, formerly known as the Salafist Group for
Preaching and Combat (GSPC).


Those attacks came only a day after three suicide bombers blew
themselves up and a fourth was killed by police in the Moroccan
city of Casablanca, fueling regional fears of a resurgence in
militant activity following crackdowns by north African
governments.


Mohammed VI expressed his "strong condemnation" of the attacks in
Algiers, which he termed "odious terrorist acts that go against
all religions and all laws.


"We are all targets, and all those in the world who believe in
religious values and in democratic norms, especially those
advocating Islam, today constitute a potential target," he said.
