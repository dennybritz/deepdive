Argentine football idol Diego Maradona was hospitalized again
Friday, two days after being released from a hospital where he
was treated for hepatitis and other effects of alcohol abuse,
medical sources told AFP.


Maradona, 46, was taken to the emergency ward of a central Buenos
Aires hospital early in the morning, said the source, who gave no
details of the retired star's ailment.


The former captain of Argentina's winning World Cup side and star
for Barcelona and Napoli spent 13 days in the hospital from late
March to be treated for excessive drinking which sparked a return
of chronic hepatitis, which he has suffered for years.


He only checked out two days ago, with his doctor saying he may
have to continue treatment for alcoholism for the rest of his
life.


Maradona was hospitalized in 2000 and 2004 for heart attacks
provoked by cocaine overdoses.
