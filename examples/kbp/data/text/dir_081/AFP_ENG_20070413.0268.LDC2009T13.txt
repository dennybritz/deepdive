Five people, including a senior police officer, were killed in
clashes between rival cult gangs in southern Nigeria's oil-rich
state of Rivers, the police said Friday.


"The incident occurred at Emohia community on Wednesday, and one
of my ASPs (Assistants Superintendent of Police) was killed,"
state police commissioner Felix Ogbuadu told AFP.


"The officer is from the community and he resides there", he
said, adding that the police have yet to make any arrests over
the killings.


Last month, gunmen killed four police officers in Port Harcourt,
the state capital and hub of Nigeria's oil industry, the Niger
delta.


The Niger delta has for months been plagued by attacks by
militant groups who are demanding a greater share of the region's
oil revenue for local people.
