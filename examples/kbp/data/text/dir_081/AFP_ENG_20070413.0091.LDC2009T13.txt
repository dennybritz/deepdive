South Korean share prices closed 0.32 percent lower Friday but
well off their lows as foreign investors continued to build
positions in Samsung Electronics, dealers said.


Samsung said its first quarter operating profit fell 42 percent
quarter-on- quarter to 1.18 trillion won (1.27 billion dollars),
well below market expectations.


The KOSPI index closed down 4.83 points at 1,520.78, off a low of
1,512.36 and a high of 1,526.09. Volume was 419 million shares
worth 4.4 trillion won (4.7 billion dollars). Rises outpaced
falls by 425 to 358.


Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth 399.5 billion
won while institutions and retail investors were net sellers of
276.9 billion won and 135.8 billion won.


"Samsung Electronics missed market expectations but it seems
investors are buying more into the prospect that the first
quarter was a bottom for the company," Shinyoung Securities
analyst Kim Se-Jung said.


Samsung Electronics fell 3,000 won to 601,000. LG Philips gained
50 to 35,700 and LG Electronics receded 800 to 64,500. POSCO
slipped 6,000 won to 380,000.
