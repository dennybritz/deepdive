The giant German services sector labour union Ver.di threatened
Friday to extend warning strikes at Deutsche Telekom if the
telecommunications giant refused to discuss better conditions for
staff being affected by a shake-up of its services activities.


Following temporary walk-outs this week, the union could step up
similar action next week "if Telekom continues to refuse to
negotiate" Ver.di's demands for job protection measures for those
employees affected, a union spokesman said.


Talks between unions and management over Deutsche Telekom's plans
to transfer 50,000 staff into a legally separate services company
at lower pay and longer hours ended in no agreement on Thursday
and were scheduled to resume on Monday.


Ver.di said there was no sign of an agreement between the two
sides.


Up to 8,000 employees staged temporary walk-outs in recent days
in protest at the plans, which the company argues are essential
to cut costs and improve service.
