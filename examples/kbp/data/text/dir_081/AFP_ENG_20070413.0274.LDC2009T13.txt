Julian Lennon, the son of late Beatles' star John Lennon, has
sold a financial stake in the group's songs that were written by
his father, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.


Lennon, 44, struck the deal with Primary Wave Music Publishing, a
New York City- based company, and the terms of the deal were to
be announced later in the day, the paper said.


Though no details were immediately made public, both parties
described "the share of the catalog as 'significant,'" the paper
said.


Julian is the son of John Lennon and first wife Cynthia. His
half-brother Sean and Sean's mother Yoko Ono are also heirs to
Lennon's compositions.
