A Swiss man pardoned from a 10-year prison sentence for insulting
the king of Thailand made a furtive return to his homeland on
Friday after being deported from the Asian kingdom.


Oliver Jufer, 57, landed at Zurich airport on a Swiss flight and
was quickly spirited away from waiting photographers and
journalists, an airport official said.


Jufer's royal pardon came just two weeks ago after he pleaded
guilty to lese majeste -- offending the dignity of 79-year-old
King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch.


Security cameras videotaped Jufer spraying black paint on the
monarch's portraits during a drunken spree in the northern city
of Chiang Mai on December 5, the king's birthday and a time of
national celebration.
