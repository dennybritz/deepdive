A Saudi man was beheaded by the sword in the northwestern city of
Tabuk on Friday after being convicted of drug smuggling, the
interior ministry announced.


Hamdan al-Masaudi was executed for smuggling "an amount of
hashish" into the kingdom, the ministry said in statement carried
by the state news agency SPA.


The execution brings to 32 the number of death sentences carried
out by the Saudi authorities so far this year.


At least 37 people were executed in 2006, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia,
which applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law.
