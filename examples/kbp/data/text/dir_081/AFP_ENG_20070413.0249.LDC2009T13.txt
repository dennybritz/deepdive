A top MP said on Friday the Tehran parliament would favour talks
with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after her controversial visit
to Iran's ally Syria, the semi-official Fars news agency
reported.


"We are ready for talks with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi," said
Mohammad Nabi Rudaki, deputy head of the influential national
security commission in Iran's conservative-dominated parliament.


"Parliamentary talks can discuss bilateral problems and bring US,
European and Iranian nations closer. They could also consider
Iran's peaceful nuclear issues," he said.


But Rudaki added that "this willingness does not mean a
resumption of political ties with the occupying and bullying US
government."


Pelosi's office said on Wednesday she had no intention of
visiting Iran after a top US lawmaker signalled she might be
interested in doing so.


House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos said after
accompanying Pelosi to Damascus to meet Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad amid stiff White House opposition that he had tried for
more than 10 years to get a visa for Iran.


Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic ties since Islamist
revolutionaries raided the US embassy in Iran in 1979 and held
staff hostage for 444 days.


The US is spearheading an international campaign to thwart Iran
enriching uranium, which it alleges to be a cover for weapons
development. Tehran denies the charges, saying its nuclear
programme is for purely peaceful purposes.
