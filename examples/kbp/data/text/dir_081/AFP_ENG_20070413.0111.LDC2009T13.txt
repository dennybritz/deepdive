A spate of anthrax deaths has forced Indonesian authorities to
seal off two villages and rush vaccines to the area, a health
official said Friday.


The emergency action affects about 2,000 villagers on Sumba
island, where five people have died from eating infected beef in
the past few weeks, veterinary official Maria Geong told
reporters.


"We have sent 50,000 doses of (animal) vaccine to the area," she
said.


Anthrax could have infected local farm animals such as cows,
goats and water buffalo, together with warm-blooded wild animals,
she said.


The disease is an acute infection that usually only afflicts
livestock but it can be transmitted to humans who handle or eat
affected animals. Sealing off the villages stops more people from
being infected.


Sumba island is in East Nusa Tenggara province, where anthrax is
endemic. The province is 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) from the
capital, Jakarta.


Some 40 human deaths from anthrax have occurred in the province
since 1994, Geong said, although the last human case around the
villages was more than 65 years ago.
