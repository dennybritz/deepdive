Philippine President Gloria Arroyo will cut a five-day visit to
China next week to less than one day so she can return to her
ailing husband's bedside, officials said Friday.


Arroyo, originally due to visit China from April 20 to 25, will
now only address a business forum in Hainan province on April 21,
said her protocol chief Marciano Paynor.


Arroyo had considered calling off the trip after her husband Jose
Miguel Arroyo had heart surgery on Tuesday to repair a leak in
the main artery and a triple- bypass of another artery.


But the improvement in her husband's condition led Arroyo to push
through with a shortened trip, said Paynor.


Arroyo's husband remained hooked up to a ventilator on Friday and
is also undergoing dialysis because his breathing and kidney
functions have not yet returned to normal.


"The most critical period (has passed) but the condition is still
guarded," said his doctor Juliet Cervantes.


Arroyo has remained by her husband's side throughout most of his
hospital confinement, setting up a makeshift office in an
adjoining hospital room so she can conduct official business
while overseeing his condition.
