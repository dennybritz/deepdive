Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo has agreed terms on a new
five-year contract at Manchester United, the club announced
Friday on its official website.


The deal will mean that Ronaldo, one of the most exciting talents
in world football, will stay at Old Trafford until at least June
2010.


"It is fantastic news," said United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.


"It emphasises the point that Cristiano is happy here and that he
is at the right club.


"He has a great relationship with the team, staff and the fans
and he will go on to be one of Manchester United's great
players."


The announcement ended months of speculation that Ronaldo could
be on his way out of England at the end of the season with
Spanish giants Real Madrid cited among the suitors.


"I am delighted," said Ronaldo of his new contract.


"I spoke with Sir Alex and (club chairman) David Gill about my
future and everyone knew that I wanted to stay.


"I am very happy at the club and I want to win trophies and
hopefully we will do that this season."
