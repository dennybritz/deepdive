The US trade deficit fell slightly to 58.4 billion dollars in
February amid a rise in exports to China and a dip in petroleum
costs, the Commerce Department reported Friday.


The figure was a bit better than the average analyst estimate of
a deficit of 60.5 billion dollars.


Imports fell 1.7 percent to 182.4 billion dollars while exports
declined 2.2 percent to 124 billion.


The politically sensitive deficit with China fell 13.3 percent to
18.4 billion dollars. Despite the drop, this still represents
about a third of the overall deficit.


The lower gap is explained in large part by a drop in oil costs,
which pushed the petroleum deficit down to the lowest level since
June 2005. The average cost of a barrel of oil was 50.71 dollars
in February, but has risen since then, suggesting the deficit
could rebound.
