An Israeli farm plans to serve up a cactus surprise -- an edible
and spineless plant with healing properties that can treat
hypertension and diabetes, the daily Maariv reported on Friday.


The prickless preparation has been imported from Mexico, where
more than 20 varieties of cactus are cultivated for their
medicinal properties, the paper said.


"In Mexico, this cactus is considered to be a delicacy," said
Rahamim Shaar, director of the Emek Hefer farm north of Tel Aviv.
"It can be cooked like a steak in a frying pan, or baked in the
oven wrapped in aluminium foil."
