German airline Lufthansa could meet a target to generate
operating profit of one billion euros (1.35 billion dollars) as
early as this year, chief financial officer Stephan Gemkow said
Friday.


"We want to achieve our goal of one billion euros in operating
profit by 2008 at the latest, under favourable conditions even
earlier," Gemkow said in an interview to be published in the
latest edition of the monthly magazine Euro next week.


Pressed by the magazine on whether Lufthansa could achieve the
goal as early as 2007, Gemkow said: "That cannot be ruled out if
conditions remain positive and there is nothing to impede our
growth."


The forecast did not take into account earnings from the recently
acquired Swiss International AirLines.


"If Swiss is consolidated, we'll earn more than one billion euros
already this year," Gemkow said.


In 2006, Lufthansa booked operating profit of 845 million euros.


The German carrier could also pay shareholders an increased
dividend for next year, the CFO continued.


"Under favourable conditions, the dividend could rise again," he
said.


From 2006 earnings, Lufthansa is paying a dividend of 0.70 euros
per share.


With regard to possible takeover opportunities in Europe, Gemkow
estimated that potential takeover candidates were "often too
expensive" because the takeover speculation had already been
priced in to their stock price.


He ruled out the acquisition of Hungarian airline Malev or the
Greek carrier Olympic.


There has been frequent speculation that Lufthansa is interested
in buying Spanish airline Iberia.
