A French academic held against his will in Iran for more than two
months after his passport was confiscated left Tehran for Paris
on Friday, a French diplomat said.


Stephane Dudoignon, an expert on Islam and Central Asia, was
briefly detained by Iranian police on January 30 and his passport
seized during a trip to the volatile southeastern province of
Sistan-Baluchestan.


The 45-year-old researcher was detained after photographing a
procession of Muslim Shiites celebrating the holy day of Ashura
and the reaction of Sunni bystanders in the town of Konarak.
