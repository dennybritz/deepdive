A leading rebel in the Central African Republic said Friday he
would be signing a peace deal with President Francois Bozize in
the northeastern town of Birao.


"I will be signing the accord at 3:00 pm (1400 GMT) with the head
of state," Damane Zakaria, head of the Union of Democratic Forces
for the Rally (UFDR), told AFP.


Bozize left the capital Bangui earlier Friday for Birao,
accompanied by reporters, but the purpose of his trip was not
revealed.


An aide to Zakaria, Abdallah Youssouf, told AFP, "The agreement
is aimed at bringing peace to the whole of the CAR. We are laying
down our arms and beginning dialogue" with the government.


The UFDR held Birao for a month last November and launched
another attack on the town at the beginning of last month but
were repelled by government troops backed by French forces.


Bozize last week called for rebels in his conflict-torn country
to disarm, state radio reported Wednesday.


The government signed a peace agreement with one of the main
rebel chiefs in February, but several groups refused to take
part, including the UFDR.


UFDR president Michel Am Non Droko Djotodia and spokesman Abakar
Sabone, are in prison in Benin. Their release depends on them
agreeing to the peace deal but they have not said if they will do
so.
