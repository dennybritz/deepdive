India and the United States said on Friday that bilateral trade
was expected to touch new heights, revved up by imports of US
motorcycles and the sale of Indian mangoes to Americans.


After years of blocking the import of Indian fruits, the United
States last year allowed Indian mangoes into its domestic markets
during a visit to New Delhi by US President George W. Bush in
March 2006.


"Last year, total bilateral trade in goods rose to close to 32
billion dollars," US Trade Representatives Susan Schwab told a
business forum in New Delhi.


"This year, total combined trade in goods and services could well
surpass 50 billion dollars," she said.


Schwab's Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said Indian and US trade
delagations had exhaustive discussions on bilateral trade "from
Harley Davidsons to mangoes."


"The good news is that Harley Davidsons will come to India and
Indian mangoes will go the United States" this year, he said.


Both sides also discussed infringement of intellectual property
rights with New Delhi asking Washington to crack down on those
marketing pirated versions of Indian films in the US market.


"We raised the issue of widespread availability of pirated Indian
films and music in the US... it can be found in any grocery
store. The US has assured us it will look into it," Nath said.


Schwab noted that more Indian organic produce would be flowing to
the United States as it can now be certified by Indian agents,
and called on Nath to further lower tariffs to boost trade and
"generate a win-win" situation.
