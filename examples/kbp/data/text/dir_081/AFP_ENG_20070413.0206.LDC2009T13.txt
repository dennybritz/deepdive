Salman Rushdie and Philip Roth top a list of 15 top novelists
from 10 countries contending for the second Man Booker
International prize, prize organizers announced in Montreal.


In a shortlist for the prize, announced Thursday, the younger
sister to the four decade-old Man Booker Prize for Fiction from
the British Commonwealth, Nigerian novelist-poet Chinua Achebe,
author of global best-seller "Things Fall Apart", and Israel's
Amos Oz led a list of the world's most prominent living authors
in English or translated into English.


Several, like Australian Peter Carey, Irishman John Banville,
Margaret Atwood, Briton Ian McEwan and Rushdie are already
laureates for the original Man Booker award.


Others on the list include American Don DeLillo, France's Michel
Tournier, Canadian Alice Munro, Canadian/Sri Lankan Michael
Ondaatje, Harry Mulisch of the Netherlands, Panama-born Carlos
Fuentes, and Persian-born Briton Doris Lessing.


"With this list, we offer a gift to readers all over the world,
an opportunity to join a conversation on 15 writers, diverse in
nationality, language, themes and techniques, but united in their
dedication to the power of the word," the judges said in a
statement.


The final prize will be announced in June, judged by academic
Elaine Showalter, writer Nadine Gordimer, and writer and
academic, Colm Toibin.


The winner of the prize, awarded every two years, receives 60,000
pounds.


The first winner in 2005 was Albanian Ismail Kadare.
