Corey Maggette had a career-high 39 and Elton Brand added 32 for
the Los Angeles Clippers, who edged crosstown rivals the Lakers
Thursday despite another 50-point effort by Kobe Bryant.


Maggette also had nine rebounds while Brand pulled down 12 in the
118-110 victory, which saw the Clippers improve to 38-40 and move
into a tie with Golden State for the eighth and final spot in the
National Basketball Association Western Conference playoff race.


Meanwhile, the Lakers fell to 40-39. They have dropped five of
their last six contests and hold just a 1 1/2-game advantage over
the Clippers and Warriors for seventh place in the West with just
three games left to play.


A nine-time All-Star, Bryant connected on 17-of-33 shots for his
ninth 50-point explosion, but the Lakers fell to 6-3 when the
superstar reaches the half- century mark.


The Clippers used a game-changing 15-2 run in the fourth quarter
to rally for a 109-103 advantage with 3:49 left. Sam Cassell's
driving layup over Smush Parker capped the run.


Parker's 3-pointer from the left corner made it a three-point
contest, but Maggette and Cassell combined to make 5-of-6 free
throws down the stretch to seal the victory.
