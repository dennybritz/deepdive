A Cambodian dissident who gained international recognition after
he was jailed for criticising the government has launched a party
to contest next year's national polls, an official said Friday.


Kem Sokha has formally applied to the Interior Ministry to stand
in the 2008 elections, heralding a much-anticipated entry into
politics, said Chhan Rith of the newly-formed Human Rights Party.


"We hope to win, as we have a lot of supporters both inside and
outside the country," he said.


Kem Sokha, a prominent social activist, was arrested in late 2005
during a widespread crackdown on dissent.


He was charged with defamation -- a criminal offence at the time
-- for allegedly accusing the government of ceding territory to
neighbour Vietnam.


Kem Sokha was jailed for several weeks along with other
government critics until all were set free on bail amid strong
international outrage.


The courts, however, have yet to dismiss the defamation cases
against them.


Kem Sokha emerged from the incident as a strong opponent of
repression, and has been hailed by international rights groups as
a welcome newcomer to Cambodia's often messy politics.


He told local media earlier this week he would weed out corrupt
government officials and "put real power in the hands of the
people." He will step down next month as head of the Cambodian
Centre for Human Rights.


After sweeping local elections held earlier this month, Prime
Minister Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party is expected to
further consolidate its power in the 2008 vote.


But Kem Sokha told local media he hoped to win 30 spots in
Cambodia's 123-seat parliament.
