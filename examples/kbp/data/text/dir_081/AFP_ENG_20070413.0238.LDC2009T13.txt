Naples is Italy's most dangerous city, with the highest level of
theft and a murder rate four times that of the capital Rome, Ansa
news agency reported a study as saying on Friday.


According to the latest study from the Transcrime research
centre, there were 4.7 homicides and 561.5 thefts reported for
every 100,000 inhabitants in Naples during 2004 and 2005.


Rome is seventh in terms of reported thefts (123.4 per 100,000
residents) and the police there counted 1.1 murder for every
100,000 residents.


After Naples, the worst towns for theft were Turin, Milan and
Bologna in the north, Bari and Palermo in the south, and Rome,
according to figures gathered by the Sacred Heart Catholic
university in Milan and Trento university.


The violence in Naples, in southern Italy, is largely fuelled by
clashes between rival mafia gangs competing for control over the
region's drug's trade.
