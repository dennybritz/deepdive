Australia should deny entry to refugees and migrants who carry
the HIV virus, Prime Minister John Howard said Friday.


Howard, who has tightened immigration rules since taking office
more than a decade ago, said he would like more advice on the
matter but his initial response was that such applicants should
be refused.


"My initial reaction is no (they should not be allowed in)," he
told commercial radio.


"There may be some humanitarian considerations that could temper
that in certain cases, but, prima facie -- no."


Howard said people infected with another illness, tuberculosis,
were already prevented from coming to Australia.


His comments follow questions about the rigour of HIV testing
among migrants.


Official figures showed the number of people with the AIDS-
causing virus moving to Victoria state had quadrupled in the past
two years and that some of these people were migrants.


The prime minister said he would consider changing the law to
prevent people infected with the virus settling in Australia.


"I think we should have the most stringent possible conditions in
relation to that nationwide and I know the health minister is
concerned about that and is examining ways of tightening things
up," he said.


Australia ran successful HIV/AIDS education campaigns in the
1980s which have kept the disease in check here, but the disease
is spreading rapidly in neighbouring Pacific countries such as
Papua New Guinea.
