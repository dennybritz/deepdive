Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels on Friday rejected allegations
that they were illegally using a commercial satellite to
broadcast overseas.


"We are accessing it legally and there is no signal piracy," a
spokesman for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Rasiah
Ilanthiriyan, said by telephone from the rebel-held northern town
of Kilinochchi.


A spokesman for Intelsat, the world's largest commercial
satellite communications provider, told AFP it was pursuing
avenues to terminate what it said was the "illegal" use of one
its satellites by the LTTE, which the US designates as a foreign
terrorist organisation.


In March 2005, the Tigers announced they were using Europe Star 1
satellite, which has since been re-named Intelsat 12, or IS-12,
to uplink their television programmes from a secret location in
northern Sri Lanka and broadcast to parts of Asia.


It is not clear whether the Tigers access the satellite service
through a proxy or on their own. The rebels declined to discuss
their arrangement with the service provider, but insisted they
had not done anything illegal.


Intelsat also said it had met Sri Lanka's Ambassador to the US to
discuss the issue.
