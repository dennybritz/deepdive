The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have decided
to ask NATO to continue patrolling their skies until 2018, when
the three alliance newcomers expect to take over the job, an
official said Friday.


"The chiefs of the Baltic defence forces decided to ask NATO to
continue with the current air defence solution at least until
2018, under which other NATO members patrol our skies," Estonian
military spokesman Andres Sang told AFP after a meeting of Baltic
army leaders in Estonia.


"Meanwhile, the Baltic states will continue joint activities to
enhance their air defence capabilities," Sang said.


"We will continue the development of the joint radar system
Baltnet, carry on joint training and devise more long-term plans
on how to carry on after 2018," he said.


The formal request to NATO will be made by the three governments
later in the year, he said.


The current agreement over the NATO patrols runs out next year.


More established members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) have taken turns patrolling the air space of
the three Baltic states since March 2004, when Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania joined the alliance.


Currently, France is policing the Baltic skies. Romania is due to
take over in August.


The Baltic states, which regained their independence from the
Soviet Union 16 years ago, lack sufficient aircraft and personnel
to run the patrols themselves.
