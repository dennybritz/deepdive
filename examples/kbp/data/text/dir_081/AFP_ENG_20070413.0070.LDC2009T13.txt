A strong earthquake struck southern Mexico early Friday and was
felt across the capital, sending some residents running into the
streets, according to an AFP reporter.


The quake, measuring 6.0 on the open-ended Moment Magnitude
scale, struck at 12:42 am (0542 GMT) and was centered 64
kilometers (40 miles) north-northwest of the southern coastal
resort of Acapulco, the US Geological Survey said.


The Moment Magnitude scale measures the area of the fault that
ruptured and the total energy released.


The quake shook Mexico City, some 220 kilometers (135 miles)
away, for over a minute, knocking out electricity for about five
minutes in some areas. Residents fled their homes into the
streets, but there were no immediate reports of damage in the
capital, according to radio Formula 21.
