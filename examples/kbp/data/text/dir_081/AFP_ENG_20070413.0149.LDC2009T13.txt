Lyon will retain Gerard Houllier as manager for next season,
despite the club's failure to make it past the last 16 of the
Champions League, club chairman Jean- Michel Aulas has said.


The former Liverpool boss is on the cusp of guiding the team to a
sixth consecutive French league title and the second under his
tutelage.


But the loss to AS Roma in the last 16 of the Champions League at
a time when Lyon were being touted as potential winners, cast
doubts over his position.


Long-time chairman Aulas, however said, there was no doubt in his
mind that Houllier would stay where he was.


"Of course he will be with the club next season," Aulas told
L'Equipe sports daily.


"You should have no doubt about that. he is staying where he is.
It's true certain players will be leaving, not because we are
unhappy with them but because it is the strategy of the club to
transfer players when they are at their best and can attract top
fees."


Houllier apart, Aulas said that two senior members of the team -
goalkeeper Gregory Coupet and Brazilian midfielder Juniho - would
definitely be staying.
