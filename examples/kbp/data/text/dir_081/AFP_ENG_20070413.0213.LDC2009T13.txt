A North Korean official told AFP on Friday there was no reason to
be "pessimistic" about the fate of a six-nation nuclear accord,
saying Pyongyang will respect its commitments once a row on funds
is resolved.


Under the breakthrough February 13 deal, North Korea has until
Saturday to start shutting down its nuclear reactor and to allow
UN nuclear inspectors.


"There is no reason to be pessimistic. We will be faithful to
this agreement if the Americans respect its clauses," Kim Son-
gyong, deputy director of the foreign ministry's European
department, told AFP in Pyongyang.


"We will respect our commitment as it is written in the February
13 agreement. No more and no less," he said.


Under the February 13 agreement, North Korea has 60 days to make
its first commitments in return for receiving the first batch of
fuel aid.


But North Korea has refused to start shutting down its Yongbyon
reactor until it sees 25 million dollars that were blacklisted at
a Macau bank.


The United States says that the money at the Banco Delta Asia has
been unblocked and that North Korea can access it.


"We will assume our responsibilities as soon as the 25 million
dollars frozen in Macau are in our hands," Kim said.


"Today marks 60 days. At the current time, the money isn't in our
hands. There has only been a verbal statement (by the United
States) which we were in the midst of verifying. But there is no
reason to be pessimistic," Kim said.


The six-nation talks include China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia
and the United States.
