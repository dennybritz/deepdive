US fashion giant Polo Ralph Lauren said Friday it aims to buy its
Japanese partner Impact 21 Co. for 347 million dollars to expand
in its second largest market and tighten control of its global
business.


Polo Ralph Lauren said in a statement that it will launch a
friendly tender offer for the 80 percent of shares in sub-
licensee Impact 21 that it does not already own.


The target company sells Polo Ralph Lauren brand clothing and
accessories to Japanese department stores.


The US apparel retailer will offer 2,600 yen, or about 22
dollars, per share during the tender offer, which will run from
April 17 to May 21.


"We will look to reinforce the brand's image and elevate the
distribution in Japan to better align with our business
globally," Polo Ralph Lauren president Roger Farah said at a
press conference.


"Japan is a key luxury market," he added.


The parent company of Impact 21, Japanese retailer Onward
Kashiyama Co., said that it and its affiliates would sell their
combined 41 percent of Impact 21 to the US fashion giant.


Polo Ralph Lauren also said it will purchase its remaining 50
percent of shares in its main Japanese master licensee, Polo
Ralph Lauren Japan, that it does not already own, for about 23
million dollars.


"We have wanted for Polo Ralph Lauren to more directly own and
operate its business on a worldwide basis," said Farah.
