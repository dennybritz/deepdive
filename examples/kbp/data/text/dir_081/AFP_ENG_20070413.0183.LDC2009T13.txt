Iraq's parliament on Friday held a special session with very few
MPs in attendance to condemn Thursday's suicide bombing inside
its canteen that killed eight people and wounded 23.


The session started with prayers from the Koran before the
speaker, Mahmud Mashhadani, addressed the gathering.


Several prominent Iraqi leaders attended the session, including
Deputy Prime Minister Barhem Saleh, Vice President Adel Abdel
Mahi and Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani.


Parliament will convene again on Saturday, Mashhadani was heard
saying on state television which broadcast the special Friday
session.
