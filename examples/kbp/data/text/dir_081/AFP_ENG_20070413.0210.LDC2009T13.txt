NATO forces and Bosnian Serb police raided Friday premises of war
crimes suspect Stojan Zupljanin's family in order to break down
his support network and track him down, police said.


In a two-and-half-hour operation NATO and police have seized a
"significant amount of documentation," police spokeswoman Tamara
Despenic told AFP without elaborating.


A police source who requested not to be named told AFP that
Zupljanin's family home in Banja Luka and a house belonging to
Mara Stojisavljevic, cousin of Zupljanin's wife, were raided.


Zupljanin, 56, has been on the run from the UN's International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) since 1999.


He was originally charged with genocide, but his indictment was
later amended and he is now wanted on charges of crimes against
humanity and violations of customs of war.


Bosnian Serb police have targeted his relatives in raids over the
past few months on suspicion that they have provided him with
financial and other assistance.


Although Bosnia's war ended more than a decade ago, The Hague-
based ICTY is still searching for six war crimes suspects,
notably Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his army
chief Ratko Mladic.


Bosnia's war claimed some 200,000 lives and left the Balkans
country split into two semi-independent entities -- the Serbs'
Republika Srpska and the Muslim- Croat Federation.
