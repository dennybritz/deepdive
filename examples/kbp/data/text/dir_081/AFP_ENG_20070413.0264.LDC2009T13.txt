US and Afghan troops backed by warplanes killed more than 35
Taliban militants during a five-hour battle in a bitterly
contested area of southern Afghanistan, the US-led coalition said
Friday.


The fighting on Thursday took place in the Sangin district of
Helmand province, which around 1,000 Afghan and international
troops wrested from insurgent control at the weekend.


"More than 35 Taliban fighters were killed by ANA (Afghan
National Army) and coalition forces during the five-hour
afternoon battle," the coalition said in a statement.


The statement said the fighting erupted after the troops
identified several militant groups in the region. US air support
was also called in, the statement said.


"During the engagement, ANA and coalition forces pursued fleeing
Taliban fighters northward, near the village of Kaj Gerd, as they
were attempting to break contact," the statement added.


Authorities said Afghan security forces and international troops
took Sangin at the weekend without any major resistance but there
have been a series of clashes there during the five days.


Sangin is one of several districts in southern Afghanistan that
have been out of government control at times during the last year
amid a fierce insurgency led by the Islamist Taliban.


Around 1,000 people, most of them militants, have died in
insurgency-related violence this year so far including 40 foreign
troops. One NAT0 soldier was killed on Friday in southern
Afghanistan.
