A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Japan's tiny Pacific
island of Torishima early Thursday, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or casualties, officials said.


The undersea quake occurred at 6:40 am (2140 GMT) at a depth of
less than 10 kilometres (six miles), with its epicentre some
1,000 kilometres south of the capital Tokyo, Japan's
Meteorological Agency said.


There was no danger of tsunami waves, the agency said.


Late last month, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9
hit the Noto peninsula in central Japan, killing one person and
injuring more than 200 others.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes. A
7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe in January
1995 killed more than 6,400 people.
