The 15 British sailors who have been held by Iran for nearly two
weeks met with British Ambassador Geoffrey Adams for the first
time during their detention, the British foreign ministry said on
Wednesday.


The eight Royal Navy sailors and seven marines, whom Iran said it
would be releasing, met with Adams "late this evening
(Wednesday)," a British foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.


"Their onward travel arrangements are being looked at now. The
meeting was not in the embassy. They are obviously still with the
Iranians," he said.


The 14 men and one woman were captured on March 23, accused of
trespassing into Iranian waters. Britain insisted they were in
Iraqi territorial waters, on a routine anti-smuggling operation.


Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad surprised observers when he
announced in a press conference on Wednesday that the group would
be freed, after nearly two weeks of detention.


During that time, they were regularly shown on television,
apparently confessing to crossing into Iranian waters, and were
also denied consular access.


British Prime Minister Tony Blair has welcomed Iran's surprise
announcement, saying there had been no negotiations to secure
their freedom.
