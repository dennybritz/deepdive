A strong earthquake shook Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores
archipelago early Thursday, according to the US Geological
Survey's Earthquake Information Center.


The quake measured 6.3 on the open-ended moment magnitude scale,
now often used by seismologists, which measures the area of the
fault that ruptured and the total energy released.


The quake hit at 1:56 am (0356 GMT), centered 93 kilometers (58
miles) east of Ponta Delgada, the Azores capital, the USGS said.
The epicenter was at a depth of 10 kilometers (six miles).


No immediate reports of damage were available.
