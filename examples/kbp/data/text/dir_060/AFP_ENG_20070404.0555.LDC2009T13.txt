Espanyol captain Raul Tamudo says his side will be focused on the
goal of winning a European trophy for the first time when they
host Benfica in their UEFA Cup quarter-final first leg clash on
Thursday.


"We haven't had luck in Europe and there are few footballers who
have played such a match. For many of us it will be our most
important game and we want to take advantage of this
opportunity," he told a news conference.


"We can reach the semi-finals and for this to happen we need to
be very concentrated because it does not happen everyday," the 29
-year-old international striker added.


"It is going to be a very difficult match. Benfica is a rival
with lots of quality and we need to defend really well."


The Barcelona-based club eliminated AC Milan and Inter Milan on
their way to the final of the UEFA Cup in 1988 but lost to Bayer
Leverkusen in the final despite winning the first leg 3-0.


Portuguese giants Benfica will be without three key players for
the game. Midfielder Paulo Jorge is sidelined with a thigh
injury, centre-back Luisao is out because of a knee injury while
Greek midfielder Konstantinos Katsouranis is suspended.
