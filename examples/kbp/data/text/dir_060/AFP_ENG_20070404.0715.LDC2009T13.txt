With Ben Wallace ailing, Ben Gordon scored 29 points and Luol
Deng had 22 and nine rebounds to lead Chicago to a 106-88
National Basketball Association victory over Detroit on
Wednesday.


A four-time Defensive Player of the Year, Wallace missed
Wednesday's matchup due to a sinus inflammation.


The illness meant Wallace missed a contest against the team where
he spent six seasons before leaving for Chicago in the offseason.


With the win, Chicago improved to 45-31 and pulled within one-
half game of the idle Cleveland Cavaliers for second place behind
the Pistons in the Eastern Conference with six games to go.


Rookie Tyrus Thomas scored four of his 13 points when the Bulls
broke the game open in the third quarter, grabbing an 84-69
advantage behind a 22-7 surge that closed out the period.


However, Thomas would not stick around to see the end of the game
as he and Detroit's Richard Hamilton got into an heated
altercation with 8:11 remaining in the fourth. Both were ejected.


The Pistons were never able to challenge in the final quarter.


Chauncey Billups scored 17 points and Rasheed Wallace added 16
despite an injured index finger for the Pistons, whose lead in
the Central Division over Cleveland was trimmed to three games.
