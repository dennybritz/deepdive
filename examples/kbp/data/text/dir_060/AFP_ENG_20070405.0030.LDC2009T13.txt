Fifteen British sailors released by Iran after two weeks in
detention left Tehran on Thursday on a flight back home to
Britain, an AFP correspondent at the airport reported.


The correspondent watched the British Airways plane leave
Tehran's Mehrabad airport at 8:38 am (5:08 GMT). The flight had
been due to leave at 8:00 am.


The state IRNA agency reported that before leaving, the sailors
were given gifts by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who
had dramatically announced their release on Wednesday. It did not
elaborate on the nature of the presents.


British ambassador Geoffrey Adams and other British diplomats
were also at the airport to see off the 14 men and one woman.


The flight, which is operated by British Airways franchise
partner British Mediterranean, is scheduled to touch down in
London at midday (1100 GMT).
