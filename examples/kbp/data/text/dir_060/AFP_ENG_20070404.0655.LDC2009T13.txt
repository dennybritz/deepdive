The 15 British sailors who have been held by Iran for nearly two
weeks met with British Ambassador Geoffrey Adams for the first
time during their detention, the British foreign ministry said on
Wednesday.


The eight Royal Navy sailors and seven marines met with Adams
"late this evening (Wednesday)," a British foreign ministry
spokesman told AFP.


"Their onward travel arrangements are being looked at now. The
meeting was not in the embassy. They are obviously still with the
Iranians," he said.
