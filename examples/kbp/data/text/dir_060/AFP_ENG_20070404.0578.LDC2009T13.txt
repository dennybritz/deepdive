Rapid Bucarest will play their next three home matches in the
Romanian league away following violent clashes that marked their
last home match, the Romanian football federation announced
Wednesday.


Rapid, who will have to play the three games on a ground at least
150 kilometres from Bucharest, will also have to pay a 6,000-euro
fine.


Around 30 people were arrested in pre-match clashes on Sunday
between fans of Rapid and city rivals Steaua Bucharest, a game
that saw 500 policemen mobilised given the history of trouble
between fans of the two teams.


Rapid, who lost 3-2 to Steaua, are currently fourth in the
Romanian league behind Steaua, FC Cluj and leaders Dinamo
Bucarest.
