US authorities gave conditional approval Wednesday to a takeover
bid by Mexican cement group Cemex for Australian rival Rinker
Group Ltd., saying a divestiture of some assets would ease
antitrust concerns.


The announcement means that if the Mexican group succeeds in its
hostile takeover, the United States would not block the deal if
the conditions are met.


Last November, Rinker management urged shareholders Wednesday to
reject an 11.7 billion US dollar takeover bid by Cemex, saying
the offer was far too low.


The US Justice Department said that in order to win approval in
Washington, Cemex would have to divest 39 ready mix concrete,
concrete block, and aggregate facilities in Arizona and Florida.


Without these sales, the merger would "substantially lessen
competition" in those areas, the agency said.


Cemex announced its offer October 27, which was due to expire on
March 30. But the Mexican group extended it until April 27.


Cemex has said the merger would create one of the world's largest
construction materials group.


It said the two companies have complementary businesses in the
United States where Rinker earns about 80 percent of its income.
