Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has revealed how he was snubbed
and then accused of arrogance by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.


Lampard, writing in Chelsea's match programme for their Champions
League clash against Valencia, claimed he was ignored by Germany
international Lehmann when he saw him in a restaurant recently.


Relations between London rivals Arsenal and Chelsea have always
been strained but Lampard admitted he was shocked when, after the
snub, he read a newspaper story in which Lehmann said he was
arrogant.


Lampard said: "I bumped into Jens Lehmann in a restaurant, he was
with his wife and he completely ignored me.


"I was with (former Liverpool midfielder) Jamie Redknapp and he
ignored the pair of us. That was before the Arsenal game and then
he later went and said I was arrogant."
