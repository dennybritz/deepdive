Malaysia's Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has blamed shoddy
work by police and state prosecutors for the failure to win
convictions in some criminal cases, reports said Thursday.


Abdullah told parliament Wednesday that a lack of legal expertise
and weak investigative efforts, which lead to sub-par witness
testimony and evidence, had contributed to the less than perfect
conviction rate.


"Among the factors are the weakness of the investigation
involving testimony methods and admissible evidence, and the main
witness disappearing or being untraceable," he was quoted as
saying in the Star daily in a written statement.


"A lack of experienced prosecutors to conduct the case may also
lead to an acquittal," he added, according to the New Straits
Times.


Abdullah said the government had won convictions last year in 74
percent of cases in Malaysia's high court, and 72 percent of
cases in lower courts.


He added that the government was working to offer more training
to state prosecutors and police officers.


Official statistics have shown that the number of criminal
incidents jumped 45.1 percent from 2003 to 2006, with 232,620
criminal cases recorded last year.
