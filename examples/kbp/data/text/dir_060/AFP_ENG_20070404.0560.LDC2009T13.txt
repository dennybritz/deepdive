Mobile phone sales in Algeria and Tunisia grew significantly last
year but declined in Morocco, according to data from the German
research group GfK.


Sales in Algeria increased in 2006 by 20 percent on the previous
year for a total of 4.9 million phones. Tunisia saw an increase
of 15 percent, with 1.7 million phones sold.


Morocco sales fell by 5 percent to 2.1 million, it said, even
though the country has the lowest prices out of the three.


The average phone price in Morocco was 65 dollars, compared to
106 in Algeria and 141 in Tunisia, according to GfK.


Mobile operators in Morocco have been subsidising the low prices,
Marie-Anne El- Metassi, head of GfK's Morocco branch told AFP.


In Morocco and Algeria, many of the phones sold were basic
models, with black- and-white screens and no cameras.
