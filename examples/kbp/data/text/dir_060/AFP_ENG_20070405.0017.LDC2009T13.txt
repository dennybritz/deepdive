The 15 British sailors released by Iran boarded their plane for
home on Thursday and were waiting for air traffic clearance for
the aircraft to taxi and take off, airport sources told AFP.


The scheduled direct British Airways flight, which is operated by
BA franchise partner British Mediterranean, had been due to leave
for London at 8:00 am (0430 GMT).
