Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa confirmed here Wednesday that
his country will return to the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, 15 years after quitting the oil cartel.


"The decision to return to OPEC has been taken and this will open
up a lot of opportunities, among them access to credit in Middle
East banks," Correa said in a news conference during an official
visit to Brasilia.


OPEC president Mohammed al-Hamili said last month that Ecuador
could return to the group it left in 1992 "at any time."


Ecuador's bid is backed by Venezuela, the only Latin American
member of OPEC. Ecuador produces 530,000 barrels of oil per day
-- its top export -- and is the fifth largest producer in South
America.


Correa had announced that Ecuador would apply to rejoin OPEC
after the leftist leader was elected in November.


However, the Andean nation faces a debt to OPEC of 5.3 billion
dollars, which it left when it withdrew from the organization.
