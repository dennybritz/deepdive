US stocks closed with modest gains Wednesday as news that Iran
was to free 15 British sailors helped offset soft economic news.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted up 17.88 points (0.14
percent) to 12,528.18 while the Nasdaq composite added 8.36
points (0.34 percent) to 2,458.69 at the closing bell.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index edged up 1.35
points (0.00 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,439.12.


The market was digesting a big rally in the prior session that
stemmed in part from hopes of an end to the two-week-old Iran-
Britain crisis and the announcement Wednesday in Iran helped keep
sentiment upbeat.


The "good news from Iran helped the market overcome two weaker-
than-expected economic reports," said Al Goldman, chief market
strategist at AG Edwards.


On the economic front, the Institute of Supply Management said
its survey of the vast US services sector resulted in a non-
manufacturing index of 52.4 percent from 54.3 percent a month
earlier, suggesting slowing growth.


The figure was weaker than the 54.7 percent expected by Wall
Street but ahead of the 50 percent which signifies expansion.


Meanwhile the Commerce Department said US factory orders rose one
percent in February after a 5.7 percent drop a month earlier.
That was below market forecasts of a 1.9 percent rebound.
