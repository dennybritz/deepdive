Two of the 15 British naval personnel set to leave Iran after two
weeks of detention there spoke of their gratefulness to Iran for
letting them go, images broadcast by the BBC on Wednesday showed.


Originally broadcast by Iranian television, the video showed
Leading Seaman Faye Turney, and Lieutenant Felix Carman speaking
to an interviewer after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced
that the group would be released after holding them for 13 days.


Turney said that the group "apologise for our actions, but many
thanks for having it in your hearts to let us go free."


Carman, meanwhile, spoke of how the group had been "treated with
a great deal of respect and dignity. All our needs have been
catered for."


"To Iranian people, I can understand why you were insulted by our
apparent intrusion into your waters, I'd like to say no harm was
meant to Iranian people ... I hope that this experience will help
to build the relationship between our countries," he continued.


The eight sailors and seven marines were captured on March 23.
Britain insisted they were in Iraqi territorial waters, while
Tehran said they were in Iranian waters.


Ahmadinejad surprised observers when he announced in a press
conference on Wednesday that the group would be freed.
