Fifteen British sailors released by Iran after two weeks in
detention left Tehran on Thursday on a flight back home to
Britain, an AFP correspondent at the airport reported.


The correspondent watched the British Airways plane take off from
Tehran's Mehrabad airport at 8:38 am (5:08 GMT). The flight had
been due to leave at 8:00 am.


The state IRNA agency reported that before leaving, the sailors
were given gifts by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who
had dramatically announced their release on Wednesday. It did not
elaborate on the nature of the presents.


British ambassador Geoffrey Adams and other British diplomats
were also at the airport to see off the 14 men and one woman.


The flight, which is operated by British Airways franchise
partner British Mediterranean, is scheduled to touch down in
London at midday (1100 GMT).


"After seeing the mountains and scenery in Iran, I understand
that Iran is a beautiful country and I will try and come back to
visit Iran," the sole woman in the group, Faye Turney, said
according to state television in comments translated from
English.


"I was so happy that I was not able to sleep all night," said one
of the commanders, Felix Carman.


"I will tell the British press the same things that I said here.
The truth is that we have been well treated," said a third
sailor, according to state television.
