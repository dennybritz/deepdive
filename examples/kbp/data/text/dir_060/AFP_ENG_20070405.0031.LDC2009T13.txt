Barry Bonds's march toward baseball history began in earnest
Wednesday as the San Francisco Giants slugger hit his first home
run of 2007.


Bonds hammered his 735th career home run, putting him 21 away
from breaking Hank Aaron's hallowed all-time mark of 755.


San Diego's Chris Young became the 435th pitcher to give up a
home run to Bonds, the seven-time National League Most Valuable
Player whose links to the BALCO steroid scandal have divided
baseball opinion on his march to the milestone.


Bonds' first-inning blast to left center field gave the Giants a
1-0 lead, but it was a two-run homer by San Diego's Adrian
Gonzalez that broke a 3-3 tie in the eighth inning and lifted the
Padres to a 5-3 victory.


The Padres also had fifth-inning home runs from Khalil Greene and
Marcus Giles.


The Padres had beaten the Giants 7-0 on Tuesday in the season-
opener for both teams, and will go for a sweep of their three-
game set on Thursday.
