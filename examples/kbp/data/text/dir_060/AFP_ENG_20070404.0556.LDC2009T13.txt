Fast bowler Stuart Broad is to replace seamer Jon Lewis in
England's World Cup squad, it was announced here Wednesday.


Gloucestershire's Lewis - who has not played in the tournament
proper - is set to return home to be with his wife, who is
experiencing complications in pregnancy, an England spokesman
said.


Broad, 20, has played five one-day internationals since making
his England debut last year.


The son of former England opening batsman Chris and the current
Young Cricketer of the Year in England, Leicestershire's Broad
was involved in England A's recent tour of Bangladesh.


He's previously been involved in England's Academy squad, which
was based in Perth during the senior side's 5-0 Ashes thrashing
in Australia.


England's chairman of selectors, David Graveney, said in a
statement: "We fully understand Jon's need to be with his wife at
this time and we are grateful to the (World Cup) Technical
Committee for approving our request for a replacement player.


"Stuart Broad performed well with the Academy squad in Australia
and on England A's recent tour of Bangladesh and I am sure he
will be thrilled to be joining up with the squad in the
Caribbean."


Lewis, 31, was one of six players fined for staying out late
drinking following England's six-wicket defeat by New Zealand in
their opening Group C match in St Lucia.
