Chinese international captain Zheng Zhi admitted on Wednesday
that unless Charlton Athletic retain their Premiership status he
could not carry on playing for them.


The 26-year-old defender is presently on loan with the
Premiership strugglers - with an option to buy him - but will
return to his Chinese club Shandong Luneng at the end of the
season and then hold talks about a permanent move.


However, Zheng, who scored on his debut for Charlton after
arriving in December, admitted everything hinged on the club
staying up.


"I will do my utmost to help Charlton avoid relegation," said the
10-times capped Zheng.


Charlton are presently in the last relegation spot third from
bottom, one point adrift of Sheffield United.


Zheng, the China captain, will feature for Shandong in the
regional A3 Championship in June.


"At that time Shandong and Charlton will have a new round of
discussions about my future contract," Zheng said.


The A3 Championship sees Shandong, the Chinese League winners,
take on their Japanese counterparts Urawa Reds, Korean champions
Seongnam Ilhwa and Shanghai Shenhua, runners-up in last year's
Chinese Super League.
