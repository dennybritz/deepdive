A New York martial arts instructor pleaded guilty Wednesday to
conspiring to provide material support to the Al-Qaeda network
after a sting operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.


Tarik Shah allegedly agreed to provide hand-to-hand combat
training to Al-Qaeda operatives in a meeting in 2005 with an
undercover FBI agent posing as a recruiter for the Islamic
extremist militant group.


During the meeting, Shah allegedly pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda
and its leader, Osama bin Laden, according to prosecutors.


"Shah repeatedly indicated his desire to train Muslim 'brothers'
in the martial arts to help them wage jihad," the US attorney's
office said in a statement.


Shah, whose nationality was not released, also allegedly told the
FBI agent he tried to enter Afghanistan in around 1998 to attend
a terrorist training camp.


He faces up to 15 years in prison and is due to be sentenced in
July.
