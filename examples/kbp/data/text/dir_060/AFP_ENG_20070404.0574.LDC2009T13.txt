England were 33-2 after 10 overs of their World Cup Super Eights
match against Sri Lanka here on Wednesday chasing 236 to win.


Kevin Pietersen was on 14 with Ian Bell on nine.


England lost captain Michael Vaughan for nought caught behind by
Kumar Sangakkara off Chaminda Vaas in the second over.


Lasith Malinga then had Ed Joyce lbw for 10 to reduce England to
11-2 in the sixth over.


Earlier Sajid Mahmood took a career-best four for 50 as England
held Sri Lanka to 235 all out.


Mahmood received good support from Lancashire team-mate Andrew
Flintoff (three for 35) in a disciplined England bowling display.


Upul Tharanga (62) and Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene (56)
were the major contributors.
