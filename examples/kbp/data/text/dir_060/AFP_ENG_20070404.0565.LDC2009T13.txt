So far, 168 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol on cutting
greenhouse gases, but major polluters such as the United States
and Australia are among those resisting.


The Algiers Appeal said that by ratifying Kyoto African countries
would have access to international financing aimed at fighting
climate change and desertification.


The appeal also called on African nations to step up regional
cooperation in water management and to set up a regional
observatory specifically to tackle desertification.


Speaking at the start of the conference on Monday, Algeria's
minister for territorial planning Cherif Rahmani warned that by
2025 the number of people living in deserts would have doubled to
two billion people.


Of them, 750 million would be in Africa, he said. Desertification
would drive 65 million Africans to seek refuge in the West, he
added.


Representatives from 20 African countries, European deputies and
international experts in the field attended the three-day
conference, which was jointly organised by the Algerian
parliament and the Pan-African parliament. bb-hz/nl/jj
