German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom has no current
plans to bid for an indirect stake in Telecom Italia that is up
for sale, industry sources said on Wednesday.


The sources said that although Deutsche Telekom was interested in
its Italian rival, no bid was planned for the time being.


Deutsche Telekom declined to comment.


Italian newspapers had reported earlier that Telekom might team
up with Mediobanca and Assicurazioni Generali in a joint bid for
a 66-percent stake in the Olimpia holding company, which owns a
controlling stake in Telecom Italia.


Olimpia, a unit of the Italian group Pirelli, is also coveted by
US telecom group AT&T and its Mexican affiliate, America
Movil.


Pirelli is in exclusive talks to sell two thirds of Olimpia to
the American and Mexican companies by April 30.
