Ivory Coast's outgoing prime minister Charles Konan Banny on
Wednesday handed over power to his successor, former rebel leader
Guillaume Soro.


Soro, who had been named prime minister by President Laurent
Gbagbo on Thursday, said he was "aware of the challenges that lie
ahead".


Konan Banny had earlier called for a "resurrection" in his
country.


He was speaking at a ceremony to mark the end of his 15 months in
power attended by most of his 34 ministers, shortly before he was
due to formally hand over to Soro, the leader of the New Forces,
known as G7.


Once a bastion of stability in west Africa, Ivory Coast has been
split since 2002 after a failed coup led by Soro. His forces
control the north of the country, while President Laurent Gbagbo
holds the south.


Handing over power to his successor, Konan Banny said he had made
"restoring trust among the Ivorian people the top priority of my
mandate".


He was imposed on Gbagbo by the United Nations as interim prime
minister in December 2005. His brief was to lead a transition
government towards parliamentary and presidential elections by
October 2006.
