Ivory Coast's outgoing prime minister Charles Konan Banny on
Wednesday handed over power to his successor, former rebel leader
Guillaume Soro.


Konan Banny earlier called for a "resurrection" in his country.


He was speaking at a ceremony to mark the end of his 15 months in
power attended by most of his 34 ministers, shortly before he was
due to formally hand over to Soro, the leader of the New Forces
rebels known as G7.


Once a bastion of stability in west Africa, Ivory Coast has been
split since 2002 after a failed coup led by Soro. His forces
control the north of the country, while President Laurent Gbagbo
holds the south.


Konan Banny was imposed on Gbagbo by the United Nations as
interim prime minister in December 2005. His brief was to lead a
transition government towards parliamentary and presidential
elections by October 2006.
