Gilbert Arenas, the Washington Wizards' leading scorer, sprained
his left knee Wednesday in the first quarter of a National
Basketball Association contest with Charlotte.


Arenas was hurt in a collision with Charlotte's Gerald Wallace.


Completing a reverse layup, Wallace crashed into Arenas near the
right block, causing the Washington player's knee to bend
awkwardly.


Arenas, who entered Wednesday's game third in the NBA in scoring,
left the court with a noticeable limp after being helped up.


He immediately went to the locker room and was not expected to
return.


A three-time All-Star, Arenas had been in the game just two
minutes. He did not start for the first time this season after
being late for the team's shootaround.


Washington was already without All-Star forward Caron Butler, who
broke his right hand against Milwaukee on Sunday when he banged
it on the backboard attempting to block a shot. Butler is
sidelined for six weeks.
