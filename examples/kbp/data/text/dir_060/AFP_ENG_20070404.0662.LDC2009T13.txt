An English football fan was said to be in a serious condition
after being stabbed in the neck during clashes between rival fans
before the Champions League quarter-final, first leg here on
Wednesday.


Italian news agency ANSA reported the Manchester United supporter
was among 18 fans taken to Rome's San Giacomo hospital after the
violence close to Roma's Olympic stadium.


ANSA said around 300 English fans, many who were under the
influence of alcohol, were involved.


Inside the stadium, United fans were baton charged by Italian
police shortly after Roma had scored their first goal in a 2-1
win for the Italian side.


The police took action after United fans had reacted to spiteful
provocation from the Roma supporters in the north enclosure.


The Roma supporters ran towards the fencing separating them from
their United counterparts and pelted them with plastic drink
bottles, many of them full.


The police then baton-charged the United supporters, leaving at
least one English fan stunned and nursing a bloodied head.


It had been ordered by Rome police chief Achille Serra that no
alcohol should be sold to fans in the Italian capital from midday
Wednesday until three o'clock the following morning.
