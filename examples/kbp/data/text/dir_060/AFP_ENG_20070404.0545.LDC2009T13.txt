Greek archaeologists have uncovered an intact tomb and what was
likely a Roman theatre on the Ionian Sea island of Cephalonia,
the culture ministry announced Wednesday.


The findings include a space of about eight metres long and six
metres wide (26 feet by 20 feet) with a vaulted tomb, a stone
coffin and two funeral vases, among other items, the ministry
said.


The front of the tomb is "particuliary interesting," according to
the ministry, with a stone door with two bolts that opens
normally.


The vases in the tomb are made of glass and ceramic. There were
also gold rings and earrings, copper keys and coins.


At another section of the searched property, archaeologists found
what looks to have been a theatre. Further digging will occur to
better identify the monument, the ministry said.


The part of the supposed theatre already uncovered includes an
orchestra section and four rows of terraces.


It is the first of its kind to be discovered on a Greek island in
the Ionian Sea which separates Greece from Italy, according to
the ministry.


It is similar to theatres found in Ambracia in western Greece and
Alexandria in Egypt.


Fiskardo, the village on the island where the discoveries were
made, was an important maritime port in the ancient world between
Italy and Greece.
