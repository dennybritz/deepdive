China will link its sections of the Silk Road into a single,
sprawling tourism zone to streamline management and promotion of
the historic trading route, state media reported Thursday.


The new plan will eliminate existing administrative boundaries
that inhibit effective management of the 2,100-year-old route,
which winds for over 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) through six
Chinese provinces and regions that now all have their own tourism
plans, the China Daily newspaper said.


"In the future, we will promote the area globally as a famous
brand of Chinese tourism," Wu Wenxue, planning and finance
director of the China National Tourism Administration, was quoted
as saying.


A "new management mechanism" would be set up for the tourism
zone, the paper said, without adding any details.


Stretching a total of 10,000 kilometres from China through
Central Asia to the Mediterranean, the interconnected series of
routes facilitated trade and cultural exchanges between Europe
and the Orient.


The paper said the plan "could pave the way for future possible
tourism cooperation with countries in Central Asia and West
Asia."


The project will include newly designed travel routes and tourism
products and is expected to be finished in November, it said.


Several sites along the Chinese part of the route are listed as
UN World Heritage sites, including the Mogao Grottoes in western
China's Gansu Province, parts of the Great Wall, and the Longmen
Grottoes in central Henan province.
