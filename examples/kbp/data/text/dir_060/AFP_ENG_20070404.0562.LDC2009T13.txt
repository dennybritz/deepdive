Former Saudi Arabian coach Gabriel Calderon was appointed coach
of the Oman national side on Wednesday.


The 47-year-old former Argentina international replaces Milan
Macala, who was sacked in February.


Calderon, who will arrive on Thursday to finalise his contract,
coached the Saudi national team from November 2004 to December
2005, but despite guiding them through the 2006 World Cup
qualifiers he failed to take them to Germany after a poor showing
in another tournament.


Calderon enjoyed a successful playing career climaxing with being
a member of the Argentinian squad that reached the 1990 World Cup
final - where they lost to the then West Germany.


Such was his popularity when he played for Real Betis that when
he was sold to French side Paris Saint Germain the Spanish team's
fans broke all the windows of the Betis president's house.
