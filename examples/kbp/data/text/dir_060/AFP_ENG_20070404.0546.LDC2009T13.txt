Oil-rich Kazakhstan has begun talks to buy a stake in a Russian-
backed pipeline project to ship oil to southeastern Europe,
Kazakh Energy Minister Baktykozha Izmukhambetov said Wednesday.


"Kazakhstan is interested in the Burgas-Alexandroupolis
pipeline," Izmukhambetov said at a press conference in the
Azerbaijani capital Baku.


"The preliminary agreement is that Kazakhstan will participate in
the project through the 49 percent share of Greece and Bulgaria."


He said formal negotiations on Kazakh participation would begin
this month.


The Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline is planned as a Russian-
controlled alternative to the US-backed Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline, which bypasses Russia to ship Caspian Sea oil to the
West.


Kazakhstan, an ex-Soviet Central Asian state with massive oil
reserves, signed up to the BTC pipeline last year, saying it
planned to ship 25 million tonnes of oil through it annually.


Russia, Greece and Bulgaria signed an agreement in Athens on
March 15 to build the Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline at a cost
of 900 million dollars (682 million euros).


Oil will be transported by Russian tankers to the Black Sea
Bulgarian port of Burgas, and the new pipeline will bring it to
the Greek Aegean Sea port of Alexandroupolis.


Construction is expected to begin next year.


A Russian consortium of the Transneft, Rosneft and Gazprom energy
companies will hold a 51-percent stake in the pipeline. Greek and
Bulgarian companies will split the remaining 49 percent.
