Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will visit South Korea next
week for a summit with President Roh Moo-Hyun, the presidential
Blue House said Thursday.


His visit from Wednesday to Friday will follow a trip to Japan.


Al-Maliki will meet Roh, Prime Minister Han Duck-Soo and other
political and business leaders to discuss cooperation in natural
resources, energy and construction.


South Korea's assistance for Iraq's reconstruction efforts and
ways to help its firms advance in the Iraqi market will also be
on the agenda, the Blue House said in a statement.


Al-Maliki will be the highest-ranking Iraqi official to visit
South Korea since the Iraqi government was launched in May last
year. Iraq reopened its embassy in Seoul in November.


South Korea has 2,300 soldiers stationed in the northern Iraqi
city of Arbil, the third largest foreign contingent after the
United States and Britain.
