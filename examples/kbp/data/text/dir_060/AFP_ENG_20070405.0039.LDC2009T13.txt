Japan said Thursday it would send some 100,000 dollars worth of
aid supplies to the Solomon Islands after an earthquake and
tsunami killed at least 32 people and left thousands at risk of
disease.


Japan will send 13 million yen (109,400 dollars) in blankets and
plastic sheets to the South Pacific archipelago, the foreign
ministry said.


It made the decision "from a humanitarian point of view for the
disaster-struck people and in light of its friendly relations
with the Solomon Islands," a statement said.


Japanese veteran groups regularly visit the Solomon Islands,
which Tokyo seized as a strategic base during World War II.


The United States, Australia and New Zealand wrested control in
the six-month Battle of Guadalcanal ending in February 1943 which
foreshadowed the defeat of imperial Japan.
