Spanish police have detained a Romanian woman who faked her own
kidnapping to keep her boyfriend from discovering she had been
unfaithful, police said Wednesday.


Mariana Catalina, 26, told police last week in the southeastern
city of Orihuela that she had been sexually assaulted and held
against her will by a group of men, a police statement said.


She said one of the men involved in the kidnapping had lured her
to Spain several years ago with a promise of a job and then
forced her to work as a prostitute after she arrived in the
country, it added.


But under questioning police spotted several inconsistencies in
her story.


Catalina finally admitted to investigators that she had made up
the tale to hide an affair. She now faces criminal charges for
making a false report.
