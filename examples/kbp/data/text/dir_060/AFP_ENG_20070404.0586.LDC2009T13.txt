Thirty-one people have now been charged over a suicide bombing in
Casablanca last month that killed one person and injured four
others, a judicial official said on Wednesday.


The final suspect, a 25-year-old man, was charged on Wednesday
after being arrested on March 23 after threatening police with a
knife.


The suspects, arrested in several towns and cities in the
northwest African country, have been charged with belonging to an
illegal group with the intention of committing terrorist acts,


The bomber, Abdelfettah Raydi, died in the March 11 attack on the
cybercafe.


His suspected accomplice, Youssef Khoudri, who was injured in the
blast, was among those charged in late March.


Prosecutors allege that the bomber's intended target was not the
cybercafe but the port of Casablanca, an army base and several
police stations in the city.
