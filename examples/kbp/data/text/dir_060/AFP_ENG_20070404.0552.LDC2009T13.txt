Ashley Sestanovich who was a body double for French footballing
star Thierry Henry was jailed for eight years on Wednesday for
helping to plan a robbery which ended in murder.


The 25-year-old professional footballer - who had spells with
Sheffield United and Manchester City - was one of seven people
sent to prison for the crime.


He was convicted of conspiracy to rob a roofing firm in
Streatham, south London, in June 2005 which ended with one of the
son's of the owner being murdered.


Sestanovich, who also played abroad with Belgian outfit Antwerp
and French side Metz, was said to have been a role model in the
south London neighbourhood where he grew up.


He won an FA Cup Player of the Round award while on loan at
Scarborough when he scored the winning goal as the non league
side knocked out second division Port Vale in the second round of
the 2003 tournament.


He got the chance to play Henry's body double in a Nike
advertisement in Rome.


The son of a Croatian mother and a Grenadan father was playing
for non-league Farnborough Town when he told the robbers when
pay-day was and how to get into the firm's offices.


Judge Giles Forrester told him: "Your occupation is one of a
professional footballer, for which you have talent.


"Nevertheless you chose to engage yourself with the likes of
(Damien Ennis one of the ringleaders sentenced to life
imprisonment) and on this occasion you played your part in the
planning of this robbery, with the appalling consequences which
followed."
