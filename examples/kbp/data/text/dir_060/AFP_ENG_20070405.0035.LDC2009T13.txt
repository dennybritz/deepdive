Fiji's first tropical cyclone of the year killed one person and
left behind a swathe of damage, emergency services said Thursday.


Relief workers said a 30-year-old woman was swept away by flood
waters while attempting to cross a flooded bridge near the
western town of Nadi late Tuesday as her husband and three
children watched helplessly.


Cyclone Cliff grew more powerful on Wednesday, causing widespread
damage in Udu, the northernmost point of the archipelago's second
largest island, Vanua Levu.


Close to its centre the cyclone packed winds of up to 95
kilometres (59 miles) an hour with gusts of up to 140 kilometres
(87 miles) an hour, the Fiji Meteorological Service said.


Radio operator Samisoni Levu told commercial radio that strong
winds damaged houses and other village buildings.


"Heavy rain caused a landslide at the village school and our
children were lucky as it happened after we sent the children
home early," Levu said.


The cyclone also caused major damage to homes and crops on the
nearby Taveuni island and in Vanua Levu.


Communications with the Lau group of islands in the east of the
country had been difficult in the storm and the extent of damage
was unknown.


The cyclone was due to head east towards Tonga.
