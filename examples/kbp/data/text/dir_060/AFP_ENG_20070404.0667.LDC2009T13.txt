The US Army is investigating the deaths of two US soldiers in
Iraq who may have died from "friendly fire," the Defense
Department said Wednesday.


The deaths of Alan McPeek, 20, and Matthew Zeimer, 18, were
announced by the Pentagon on February 5. At the time it said the
two had died on February 2 in Ramadi of injuries they sustained
from enemy gunfire.


The Army has announced a unit-level investigation into the
circumstances of the soldiers' deaths and "friendly fire is
suspected," the Pentagon said in a statement.


More than 3,250 US soldiers have died in Iraq since the March
2003 invasion.
