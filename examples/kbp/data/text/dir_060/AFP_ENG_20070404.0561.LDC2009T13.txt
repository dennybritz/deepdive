Three days after clinching a mega free trade deal with South
Korea, the United States warned Wednesday it would not sign the
agreement unless Seoul allowed full access to American beef
imports.


"We would not sign it if we do not have a clear path on beef,"
USTR spokesman Sean Spicer said.


Seoul's ban on US beef over fears of mad cow disease is not
officially part of the free-trade agreement clinched over the
weekend after 10 months of negotiations but US lawmakers have
warned they would block any deal unless the issue is resolved.
