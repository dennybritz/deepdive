Insurgents shot dead a US soldier during a routine patrol in an
eastern district of the Iraqi capital, the military reported on
Thursday.


The soldier was attacked with small arms fire on Tuesday, a
military statement said.


The latest fatality brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 2,356, according to Pentagon figures.
