Manchester United fans were baton charged by Italian police here
on Wednesday during their Champions League quarter-final first
leg clash with AS Roma.


The police took action after United fans reacted to Roma
supporters charging towards them following Rodrigo Taddei's
first-half goal for the hosts.


The Roma supporters ran towards the clear-plastic fencing
separating them from their United counterparts which resulted in
the latter breaching the line of stewards and hurling plastic
bottles at the Italians.


The police reacted by baton charging the United supporters,
leaving at least one English fan stunned and nursing a bloodied
head.


Before the match seven people were injured in brief scuffles
between the rival group of fans, according to the ANSA news
agency.


Three English were among those injured, as around 300 English
fans, including many who were under the influence of alcohol,
clashed with Roma supporters an hour before kick-off.


Italian police intervened and launches several charges into the
crowd and order was quickly restored, ANSA said.


It had been ordered by Rome police chief Achille Serra that no
alcohol should be sold to fans in the Italian capital from midday
Wednesday until three o'clock the following morning.
