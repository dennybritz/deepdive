England were 159-6 after 40 overs of their World Cup Super Eights
match against Sri Lanka here on Wednesday chasing 236 to win.


Ravi Bopara was on 12 with Paul Nixon on 11.


England lost captain Michael Vaughan for nought caught behind by
Kumar Sangakkara off Chaminda Vaas in the second over.


Lasith Malinga then had Ed Joyce lbw for 10 to reduce England to
11-2 in the sixth over.


Ian Bell, who put on 90 with Pietersen, was then run out in the
26th over when he had made 47 and with the score on 101.


Kevin Pietersen then fell for 58 caught and bowled by Muttiah
Muralitharan which prompted a mini-collapse with Andrew Flintoff
(two) and Paul Collingwood (14) both falling to Dilhara Fernando
with the score on 133.


Earlier Sajid Mahmood took a career-best four for 50 as England
held Sri Lanka to 235 all out.


Mahmood received good support from Lancashire team-mate Andrew
Flintoff (three for 35) in a disciplined England bowling display.


Upul Tharanga (62) and Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene (56)
were the major contributors.
