Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stunned the world on
Wednesday by announcing the sudden release of the 15 British
sailors arrested by Iran.


Here are the key quotes from his dramatic news conference:


ANNOUNCING THE RELEASE


"Although Iran has the right to prosecute them, by following the
model of the prophet the 15 people were pardoned and their
freedom given as a gift to the British people."


MEETING THE BRITISH SAILORS


"Your release is because of the birthday of the great prophet of
Islam."


ON FUTURE RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN


"The British government, in a letter, has vowed not to repeat
such incidents. But this release is not linked to this letter. It
is due to Islamic goodwill."


ON RELATIONS WITH THE US


"Today we have no objection to relations (with Washington) but
this requires US action.".


A MESSAGE FOR THE SAILORS


"These military people, from point of view of humanity, are
respected individuals for us. Our message is we are seeking peace
and justice for all human beings."


MESSAGE TO TONY BLAIR


"I ask Mr Blair, instead of reinforcing international tensions
and modernising Britain's nuclear weapons and occupying other
countries, to return to justice and morality."


ON "CONFESSIONS" OF ILLEGALLY ENTERING IRANIAN WATERS


"I ask (British Prime Minister Tony) Mr Blair not to judge the
military personnel for the truths that they said."


ON THE SOLE FEMALE CAPTIVE


"Among the British who were arrested, there was a women who was
the mother of a child. Why do they give such missions to a woman
who is the mother of a child to patrol the sea?"
