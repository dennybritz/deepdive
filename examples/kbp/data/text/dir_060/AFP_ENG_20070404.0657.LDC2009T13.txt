Mark O'Meara, the 1998 Masters winner, doomed his chances of
capturing this year's first major championship if tradition holds
by winning the Masters Par-3 Contest here Wednesday.


No one who has won the event over the select nine-hole course at
Augusta National Golf Club has ever gone on to win the Masters in
the same year since the Par-3 tournament began in 1960.


O'Meara, 50, fired a five-under par 22 to defeat fellow American
Zach Johnson and England's Luke Donald by one stroke.


O'Meara became the first former Masters champion to capture the
Par-3 crown since Scotsman Sandy Lyle took back-to-back triumphs
in 1997 and 1998.


After following his Masters triumph with a British Open victory
nine years ago, O'Meara has failed to win another elite-level
tour event.
