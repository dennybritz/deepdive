South Korea's health authorities said Thursday they have
suspended the prescription of anti-flu medicine Tamiflu to young
people following reports of severe side-effects in Japanese
users.


"A safety warning has been issued so that teenagers should not be
prescribed Tamiflu except for special cases," an official of the
Korea Food and Drug Administration told AFP.


Tamiflu, manufactured by Swiss drug giant Roche, has been used
extensively in South Korea and other countries amid continuing
cases of bird flu in Asia.


Healh authorities in Tokyo said Thursday that more than 100
Japanese, mostly young children and teenagers, have behaved
abnormally since taking Tamiflu and eight had killed themselves.


In late 2005, South Korea reported a case in which one person who
took the drug suffered from severe nightmares, the administration
said.


South Korea was hit hard by bird flu between December 2003 and
March 2004 and had several more outbreaks this winter but no one
has died of the disease.


Roche denies its drug has any dangerous side-effects.
