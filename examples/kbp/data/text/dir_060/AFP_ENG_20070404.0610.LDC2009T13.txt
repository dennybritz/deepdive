Swedish researchers announced Wednesday that they had
successfully carried out womb transplants on four sheep, which
subsequently became pregnant.


They say the success of the operations brings the prospect of
human uterus transplants one step closer.


The sheep were operated by laparotomy, an incision through the
abdominal wall, said Professor Mats Braennstroem of Gothenburg
University's department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.


"We took the uterus outside the body, we kept it for a couple of
hours outside the body," he added.


When they put the uterus back in the same body they connected it
with other blood vessels and to the vagina.


"After four to six weeks the sheep went back to the farm and then
they have been put with rams and they have been mating and four
of the five are pregnant," Braennstroem added.


"I think this is successful, because what it proves is that you
can put the uterus back with a different blood supply and you can
do that in large animal species.


"I think this is one small step forward to human uterus
transplantation."


One of the main difficulties in the operations had been the
problem of reconnecting the blood vessels, he said.


Of the 14 sheep used in the research, some had not survived the
operations, according to a report in the magazine New Scientist.


Braennstroem said that from next week, they planned to move from
removing and replacing a uterus from the same subject, to
transplanting a uterus from one subject to the other.


But this would bring a fresh complication, he added: the risk of
the recipient rejecting the uterus.
