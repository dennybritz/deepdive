The former transport minister of Macau, arrested in December for
suspected corruption, has amassed a personal fortune of more than
100 million dollars, graft investigators said on Thursday.


They said Ao Man-long had assets worth at least 57 times more
than his family's income, including cash, bank deposits, watches
and jewellery, a 300-bottle wine cellar and expensive delicacies
like abalone and shark's fin.


The Commission Against Corruption of Macau (CCAC), which has not
yet concluded its investigation, said Ao awarded contractors
public construction projects in return for kickbacks.


"We discovered that Ao Man-long had used the power of his
position to collude with a number of public project contractors
and had offered and taken bribes between 2002 and 2006," it said.


It determined Ao, the highest-ranking official held on corruption
charges in Macau since the former Portuguese colony was handed
back to China in 1999, had total assets worth 800 million Macau
patacas (102.6 million US dollars).


CCAC said it uncovered some cash in euros and US dollars in safe
deposit boxes and hidden in bookcases at their residence. More
cash was kept in safe deposit boxes in Macau and Hong Kong banks.


It said 30 people were involved in the case -- government
employees, Ao's relatives and contractors. They are accused of
money laundering.


Ao is being held in a Macau prison. At the very least he will
face charges of having assets not commensurate with his earnings,
the anti-graft agency said.
