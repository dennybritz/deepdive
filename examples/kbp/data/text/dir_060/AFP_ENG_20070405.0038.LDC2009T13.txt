At least 13 people were injured in a bombing in Thailand's mainly
Muslim south, one of a string of overnight attacks by suspected
Islamic separatists, officials said Thursday.


Suspected insurgents staged 12 arson attacks, mainly at
elementary schools, and bombed the home of a local Muslim
religious leader in Yala province, the officials said.


No one was injured in the fires, but at least 13 people were
injured in the bombing, provincial governor Theera Mintrasak
said.


The attacks took place in two districts of Yala that are under a
military- imposed curfew aimed at stemming a sharp surge in
attacks, including the massacre of nine Buddhists and the bombing
of a mosque last month.


"They are challenging the government's curfew in those two
districts," Theera said.


Army officials were at a loss to explain how the militants could
have conducted the raids in areas where extra forces have already
been deployed to enforce the curfew imposed three weeks ago.


The army is considering how to toughen up its enforcement of the
curfew, spokesman Acar Tiproch said.


"We have to carefully consider our options... All measures will
be reasonable," Acar added.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in the Muslim-majority
region bordering Malaysia since the insurgency began in January
2004.


The military-installed government has launched a raft of peace
measures, only to see the attacks escalate in the last six
months.
