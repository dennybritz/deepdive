Troops killed three suspected Tamil rebels along the de facto
border in northern Sri Lanka as the air force bombed guerrilla
targets elsewhere, the defence ministry said Thursday.


Security forces shot dead three men who tried to infiltrate the
army's defence lines at Muhamalai in the Jaffna peninsula on
Wednesday night, the ministry said.


The shooting came hours after the air force bombed what it called
the main Sea Tiger headquarters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE), a claim rejected by the guerrillas.


The LTTE initially said there were no casualties in the aerial
bombardment in the district of Mullaitivu, but later gave details
of two civilians who had been killed and four more who were
wounded.


The first air raid hit the "White Pigeon" charity which helps
victims of landmines, the LTTE said, adding that the civilians
died in further aerial bombing in the same area.


The air force suffered a humiliating attack last week when Tiger
aircraft bombed its main base next to the island's only
international airport and managed to escape unchallenged.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005.
