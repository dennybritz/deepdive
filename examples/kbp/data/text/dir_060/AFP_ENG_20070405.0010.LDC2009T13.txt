The 15 British sailors released by Iran arrived at Tehran airport
Thursday morning to take a flight back home to Britain, an AFP
correspondent reported.


They were to take a scheduled direct British Airways flight
leaving for London at 8:00 am (0430 GMT). They were taken inside
the area reserved for VIPs in two minibuses escorted by police.


British ambassador Geoffrey Adams and other British diplomats
were also at the airport to see off the 14 men and one woman.


The flight, which is operated by British Airways franchise
partner British Mediterranean, is due to touch down in London at
midday (1100 GMT).
