The last living US sailor to have served in World War I was
buried Wednesday after dying at 105, the US Navy said.


Lloyd Brown, born October 7, 1901, lied about his age to join the
navy at age 16 in 1918.


He was assigned to the USS New Hampshire, commissioned in 1908.
Brown far outlasted the ship, which was scrapped in 1923.


He died at a veterans' hospital in Charlotte Hall, Maryland.


Two years ago, Brown explained why he was so keen to join the
navy: "All the young men were going in the service. They were
making the headlines, the boys that enlisted.


"And all the girls liked someone in uniform," he told The
Baltimore Sun in 2005.


There are but four known survivors of the Great War, three from
the US Army and a third from the Canadian, at least as far as the
records go.


"These are the people enrolled in the VA," Veterans
Administration spokesman Jim Benson said. "There might be some
others that we don't know of."


Some 4.7 men and women joined the US armed services in the
1914-1918 war, of which 53,000 were killed and 204,000 were
wounded.
