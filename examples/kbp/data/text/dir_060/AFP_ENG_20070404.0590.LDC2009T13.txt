Danish prosecutors have filed an appeal in a recent terrorism
financing case that resulted in the acquittal of two members of a
Muslim association, a news agency reported.


Palestinian Rachid Mohamad Issa, who heads the Al-Aqsa
association, and Ahmad Mohamad Suleiman, a Dane of Palestinian
origin and the organisation's treasurer, were indicted in
December 2005. They were accused of financing two charities
linked to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.


The Copenhagen district court acquitted the two in March and
rejected numerous Israeli documents presented by prosecutors.


Prosecutors were unable to provide a witness from Israel to
support accusations in the documents.


It was the first time an organisation and its members had been
charged under Denmark's new anti-terror legislation adopted in
2002.


"My client is very surprised," Issa lawyer Ritzau Bjoern Elmquist
said of the prosecutors' decision to appeal.


A lawyer for Suleiman said the case was not likely to come before
the appeals court until next year.
