Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene believes the two heart-
stopping finishes against South Africa and England can inspire
his team's push to the World Cup title.


Sri Lanka lost by one wicket to South Africa last week but turned
the tables on England by clinching a nerve-shredding last ball
two-run win here on Wednesday.


Dilhara Fernando clean bowled Ravi Bopara with the last delivery
of a dramatic Super Eights match which put Sri Lanka, the 1996
champions, into second place in the table and on course for the
semi-finals.


England, chasing 236 to win, are in fifth place and currently out
of the semi- finals shake-up and with a match against champions
Australia next up on Sunday.


"We bowled well and got wickets at crucial times," said
Jayawardene whose team had England reeling at 133-6 at one stage.


"It was a brilliant all-round effort. We bowled in the right
areas but it wasn't good for the heart.


"The South Africa game was also too close for comfort but it just
shows that everyone is fighting for it. It's an important
tournament and finishes like this are good for cricket.


"We had them at 133-6 and thought we were just one ball away from
exposing the tail. But Paul Nixon (42) and Ravi Bopara (52)
batted really well and took it to the last few overs."


Jayawardene admitted that he thought his team's total of 235
would not have been enough to defend.


"I threw away my wicket and I thought we were 15-20 runs short,
but the bowlers came back strongly."
