The 15 British sailors released by Iran arrived at Tehran airport
Thursday morning to leave on a flight back home to Britain, an
AFP correspondent at the airport reported.


They were expected to take a scheduled direct British Airways
flight leaving Tehran for London at 0430 GMT. They were taken
inside the area reserved for VIPs in two minibuses escorted by
police.
