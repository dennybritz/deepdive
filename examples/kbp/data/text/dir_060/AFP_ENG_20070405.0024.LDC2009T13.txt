Japanese video game giant Nintendo said Thursday its earnings for
the year ended last week would exceed forecasts, thanks to strong
sales of its game machines.


The company now estimates its sales for the year to March 31 to
reach 966 billion yen (8.13 billion dollars), up 66 billion yen
from previous expectations.


The inventor of the Super Mario series has been immensely
successful with a full range of game products.


Nintendo has dominated the global market for handheld machines
with its Game Boy series, followed by the introduction in 2004 of
the Nintendo DS double-screened machine.


It last year made a fresh attempt to crack into Sony's lead in
household consoles with its Wii, which also has been popular with
its relatively low prices and user-friendly interface.


The upward revision in earnings is "primarily due to robust
trends in sales of Nintendo DS software and hardware," a company
statement said.


Nintendo said it expected its net, recurring and operating profit
also to top previous forecasts, although it did not provide new
figures.


The company also said it will enjoy foreign exchange gains worth
20 billion yen due to the euro's strength against the yen.


Nintendo had earlier expected annual sales of 900 billion yen,
operating profit of 185 billion yen, recurring profit of 210
billion yen and net profit of 120 billion yen.


The Kyoto-based firm is to disclose its full financial figures on
April 26.
