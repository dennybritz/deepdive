Lecturers at Zimbabwe's three state universities have called off
a three-week pay strike after being ordered back to work by the
country's labour court, their union said Wednesday.


The lecturers are to go immediately into fresh negotiations with
their employers hoping to resolve an ongoing salary dispute.


"We are back at work," James Mahlaule, president of the
Association of University Teachers (AUT) told AFP.


"The labour court ordered that the strike stop immediately. It
also ordered that we go straight into negotiations with our
employer."


Lecturers at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital Harare,
the National University of Science and Technology in the second
city of Bulawayo and the Midlands State University embarked on
the strike following a long unresolved pay grievance.


They are demanding a minimum monthly salary of 1.7 million
Zimbabwean dollars (6,800 US dollars / 5,134 euros) for a junior
lecturer, up from the current 431,000 dollars, and three million
dollars for professors.


In addition they want 50 percent of the proposed salaries in
housing and transport allowances.


The lecturers now want the salary to be reviewed to 1.9 million
Zimbabwe dollars in line with inflation, Mahlaule said.


The southern African country is in the midst of an economic
crisis characterised by an inflation rate of 1,730 percent,
shortages of basic commodities and fuel.
