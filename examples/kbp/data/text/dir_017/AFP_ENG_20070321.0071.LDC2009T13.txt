China's General Administration of Civil Aviation said Wednesday
that the country's air passenger traffic in 2006 rose 16.7
percent to 332 million.


According to reports from airports across China, international
passenger traffic increased 14.6 percent to 32.6 million, while
domestic passengers rose 17 percent to 299.3 million, the
administration said in a statement.


Cargo transported on international routes jumped 23.6 percent to
2.5 million tonnes last year, compared with a 19 percent rise in
total cargo throughput to 7.5 million tonnes, it said.


Such rapid growth is attracting the world's major aircraft
manufacturers, with Europe's Airbus estimating China will need
2,650 passenger planes over the period 2006 to 2025.
