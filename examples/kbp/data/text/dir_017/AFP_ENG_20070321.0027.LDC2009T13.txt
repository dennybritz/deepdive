Chinese cemeteries are selling paper replicas of Viagra pills to
be burned for dead relatives as a wish for satisfying sex in the
afterlife, state media reported Wednesday.


Customers are snapping up the paper Viagra, as well as images of
condoms and heavily made-up bar girls ahead of the annual
Tombsweeping Festival on April 5, the Nanjing Morning News
reported.


Chinese have traditionally burned fake money in honour of dead
relatives during the festival, when families clean their
ancestors' tombs and graves.


They believe the wealth will accrue to their ancestors in the
afterlife.


But China's move toward a more consumer-oriented society has seen
new offerings including paper televisions, mobile phones, cars
and other luxury items.


A commentary in the Beijing Morning Post on Wednesday called for
a crackdown on the sex-related "vice" offerings.


However, it said efforts by authorities to halt the sales had
been unsuccessful due to high demand.
