Oil prices rose in Asian trade Wednesday ahead of weekly data on
US energy stockpiles, with the market closely watching gasoline
(petrol) inventories ahead of the key US driving season, dealers
said.


At 2:20 pm (0620 GMT) New York's main oil futures contract, light
sweet crude for delivery in May, was up 24 cents to 59.49 dollars
a barrel. The April contract expired at the close of US trade
Tuesday.


Brent North Sea crude for May delivery was up 23 cents at 60.43
dollars.


Gasoline stockpiles are in focus ahead of the peak demand season,
beginning May 31, when US drivers throng roads during their
summer vacations.


The US Department of Energy was to publish its weekly energy
report later Wednesday.


"I guess people are waiting for the report ... people are
expecting a heavy drop in gasoline," said Commonwealth Bank
commodity strategist Tobin Gorey in Sydney.


"The market has growing concerns that (with) the drop in gasoline
inventories, supply is not going to keep up with demand come
summer," he said. "It is a gasoline issue now."


Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish said fast-falling US
gasoline inventories, lower import availability and very strong
US demand levels were all lending support to prices.


Dealers added that recovering world stock markets, after a rout
last week, had also supported investor sentiment.
