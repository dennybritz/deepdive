A Panamanian-registered cargo vessel carrying 19 crew members
sank off the Philippines Wednesday, the coast guard said.


Eleven of the crew have been rescued, and a search has been
launched for those still missing after the Unicorn-Ace sank off
the northern coast of the main Philippine island of Luzon, said
coast guard spokesman Lieutenant Commander Armand Balilo.


It was not clear what caused the incident or what the vessel was
carrying, Balilo said. The identities and nationalities of the
crew were still being verified, he added.
