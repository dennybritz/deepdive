South Korean automakers will hire fewer sexy models for next
month's Seoul Motor Show because they want visitors to admire the
cars rather than the girls, a report said Wednesday.


Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest automaker, has hired 36
female models compared to 46 two years ago, the Korea Times
reported. Its affiliate Kia Motors will reduce the number of
models by eight this year to 36, with other automakers following
suit.


Fewer models will wear miniskirts or sleeveless tops, the paper
said.


"There has been criticism that the shows are not motor shows but
model shows," a Hyundai official was quoted as saying. "With the
reduction of female models, our new cars will be the main focus."
