Here are six tips from "moose whisperer" Rick Sinnott, the
management biologist for the Alaska department of fish and game,
in case you should stumble upon a moose.


What do you do if you spot a moose: "Usually if the moose is
standing on the trail you want to wait for it to get out of the
way. Moose get the right of way. You can try clapping at it to
make it move. Sometimes you can do that but you have to use that
with some discretion if they're acting agitated."


What's a safe distance from a moose: "20 feet is not safe, but
usually you can do it. 100 feet is safe, or a couple house
lengths."


How to tell when a moose is getting ready to charge: "They'll put
their ears back, raise the hackles on the back of their neck and
lick their lips."


What to do if a moose charges you: "Jump out of the way or get
behind a tree. It will run at you and if you turn and run away
it'll usually stop and look at you, but if you stand your ground
they'll rush at you."


What not to do: "Throw rocks or snowballs at them or get between
a mother and her calf."


Why: "You really don't want to stress a moose out. They're much
bigger than you."
