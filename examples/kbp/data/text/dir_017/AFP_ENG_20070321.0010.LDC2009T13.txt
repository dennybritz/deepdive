At least 37 survivors of the devastating 2005 earthquake in
Pakistani Kashmir have been killed in landslides triggered by
heavy rains, police said Wednesday.


Twenty-seven people, mostly women, died and 16 were injured when
a huge landslide hit Doba Syedan village in the Jhleum Valley
area late Tuesday, police spokesman Javed Ahmed told AFP.


Another ten were killed at Jabar Daray village in the mountainous
Bagh district on Tuesday, Ahmed said.
