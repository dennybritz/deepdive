The governor of Louisiana, heavily critized for her response to
Hurricane Katrina, says she will not seek a second term in
November.


Kathleen Blanco, a Democrat, said in a televised address on
Wednesday evening that she had decided against running to ensure
election year politics would not disrupt an upcoming legislative
session in the southern US state.


"While so many still suffer, I am choosing to do what I believe
is best for my state. I will focus my time and energy for the
next nine months on the people's work, not politics," Blanco
said.


The governor has come under persistent fire in the aftermath of
the devastating storm that hit the Gulf of Mexico coast on August
29, 2005, which flooded most of New Orleans and killed about
1,500 people.


Her approval ratings have never recovered since the hurricane and
a prominent Republican rival had enjoyed a wide lead in opinion
polls.


Blanco was blasted by lawmakers in Congress and by the national
and local media, with the New Orleans Times-Picayune writing in a
2005 editorial: "She came across as at once paralyzed and
desperate."


President George W. Bush and federal agencies under his
leadership also have come in for stinging criticism over Katrina.
