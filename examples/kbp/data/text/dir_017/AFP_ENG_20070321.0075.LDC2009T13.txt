At least 14 people including six soldiers were killed Wednesday
as deadly fighting raged in southern Mogadishu, sparked by an
attack on an Ethiopian military base, witnesses and an AFP
correspondent said.


Three uniformed soldiers were killed, an AFP correspondent said,
adding that two of their bodies were burned and one was dragged
through the streets


"Three people were killed after shells landed in their house. I
saw the bodies and one of them is my relative," resident
Abdulkadir Hassan told AFP.


The latest deaths took the toll from eight to 14.
