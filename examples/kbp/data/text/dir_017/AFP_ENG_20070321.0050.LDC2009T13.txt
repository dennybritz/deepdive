North Korea's top Olympic official will visit South Korea next
month for talks on launching a united governing body for the
traditional Korean martial art, taekwondo, officials said
Wednesday.


International Olympic Committee member Jang Ung will arrive in
Seoul on April 6 at the head of a North Korean taekwondo
delegation, the International Taekwondo Federation (ITF) said in
a statement.


Jang heads the ITF, which is run by North Korea. It opened a
branch in Seoul in January.


In Seoul he will meet Choue Chung-Won, head of the World
Taekwondo Federation, which is led by South Korea, and other
sports officials, an ITF official in Seoul told AFP.


"He will reaffirm North Korea's support for the bid by South
Korea's eastern alpine resort of Pyeongchang to host the 2014
Winter Olympics," the ITF official said.


"He is also expected to discuss ways to unify the two (taekwondo)
federations."


The two federations agreed in Qatar last December to form a
coordinating body to discuss a merger. Its first meeting will be
in Beijing on March 31.
