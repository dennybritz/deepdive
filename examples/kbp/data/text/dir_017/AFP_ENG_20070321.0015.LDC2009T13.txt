At least 37 survivors of the devastating 2005 earthquake in
Pakistani Kashmir have been killed in landslides triggered by
heavy rains, police said Wednesday.


Twenty-seven people, mostly women, died and 16 were injured when
a huge landslide hit Doba Syedan village in the Jhelum Valley
area late Tuesday, police spokesman Javed Ahmed told AFP.


Another ten were killed at Jabar Daray village in the mountainous
Bagh district on Tuesday, Ahmed said.


"It has been raining here for two days and the landslides
happened almost simultaneously. These people were in houses built
on terraces on the hillsides and huge landslides buried them,"
Ahmed said.


"Police and army teams are in the area trying to remove the
debris and recover the bodies. So far two bodies have been
recovered in the Jhelum Valley. Efforts being made to recover the
others."


Ahmed added: "It's very unfortunate. These are the people who
were worst hit in the earthquake."


The 7.6-magnitude quake in October 2005 claimed more than 73,000
lives, seriously injured nearly 70,000 people and left 3.3
million homeless in Pakistan. More than 1,000 also died in Indian
Kashmir.
