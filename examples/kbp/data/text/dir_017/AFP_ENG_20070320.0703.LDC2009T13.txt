Leisel Jones has been setting goals since she first burst on the
scene as a 14 -year-old, but the relaxed Australian is avoiding
that tactic at the World Swimming Championships.


The 100m and 200m breaststroke world champion and world record
holder is highly fancied to retain both those titles and may also
add the 50m crown to her bulging trophy cabinet.


While the 21-year-old is adamant she wants to break more world
marks, she is taking it one step at a time.


"I haven't set a goal for the meeting. I've just been
concentrating on putting everything together. I just want to get
the optimum out of every race," she said here, adding that she
was taking nothing for granted.


"There are eight girls in a final and they will all want to be
the winner and that's what I am using as motivation."


The difference for her this time is that she is feeling more
relaxed than ever, considering Melbourne as a second home with
family and friends nearby.


"We've been having a good time in camp. I've been having a good
time training with Melanie Schlanger and we've been having a
great laugh, everything's pretty relaxed," she said.


"I've never been this relaxed prior to a competition before.


"I just love Melbourne, it's like a second home and all of my
family and friends will come to watch and spur me on.


"I will be out to try and break world records but it's also about
having a good time."


Jones gets her campaign underway on Sunday when she gets her
first taste of action in the 100m breaststroke heats.
