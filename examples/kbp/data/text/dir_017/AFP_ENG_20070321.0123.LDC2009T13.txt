Tanzania has recruited another Brazilian to coach its national
youth teams in a bid to boost the country's faltering sport,
officials said on Wednesday.


Marcus Aurerio Timoso will take charge of the under-17 and
under-23 teams becoming the second South American after fellow
Brazilian Marcio Maximo who took charge of national side Taifa
Stars last year.


Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) secretary general Frederick
Mwakalebela said Timoso's appointment was in line with the pledge
made by the President Jakaya Kikwete to promote the standards of
the game.


The approach has already shown some marked improvement for the
Tanzanian clubs and the Taifa Stars scoring a series of successes
in continental football competitions.


Under Maximo, the Taifa Stars currently lead Group Seven in
gualifying for the 2008 African Nations Cup finals and are due to
meet the 2002 World Cup finalists Senegal in a top-of-the-table
clash in Dakar on Saturday.
