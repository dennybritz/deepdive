Turkish experts arrived on Wednesday in Jerusalem's Old City to
inspect controversial renovations near the revered Al Aqsa mosque
compound, the Israeli Department of Antiquities said.


The seven-member delegation includes architects, historians and
archaeologists, antiquities department spokesman Osnau Gouez told
AFP.


The experts will spend two days inspecting the controversial
project which seeks to enlarge and bolster a ramp just inside the
Old City's Dung Gate that connects the Western Wall prayer plaza,
revered by Jews, to the Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest
shrine.


Their mission was agreed on during Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert's February meeting with his Turkish counterpart Recep
Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, when Erdogan said the Israeli leader
had "failed to convince me 100 percent" that the repair work was
innoccuous.


The delegation is to issue a report on its conclusions.


Israel says it has nothing to hide and is merely replacing a
damaged and dangerous wooden bridge leading to the site with a
stone ramp.


The work, however, has sparked violent Palestinian protests and
angered Muslims worldwide who fear it threatens one of Islam's
most sacred mosques.
