A Nigerian court has granted an accelerated hearing in a suit by
Vice President Atiku Abubakar to challenge his disqualification
from next month's presidential poll, state media said Wednesday.


Presiding judge Tijani Abubakar on Tuesday ordered that the court
papers be served on the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC).


He also granted an order giving the electoral body only two days
instead of the usual eight to respond in order to speed up the
trial.


Abubakar went to the federal high court in Abuja following his
disqualification last week by INEC from running in the April 21
election because of his alleged indictment for corruption.


The embattled vice president, who has been embroiled in row with
President Olusegun Obasanjo for the past three years, argued that
INEC did not have the power to disqualify him without an order
from a competent court.


Abubakar became the presidential candidate of the opposition
Action Congress last December after he was forced out of the
ruling People's Democratic Party because of his row with
Obasanjo.
