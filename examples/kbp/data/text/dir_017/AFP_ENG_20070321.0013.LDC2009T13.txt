China is pushing for membership in the Inter-American Development
Bank in a bid to strengthen economic ties with the nations of
Latin America, state media and the government said Wednesday.


The Asian giant came a step closer earlier this week when central
bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan signed a memorandum of understanding
on Chinese entry into the development bank, the China Daily
reported.


Zhou signed the document with the IADB's president, Luis Moreno,
during the bank's annual meeting in Guatemala, it said.


"The memorandum of understanding shows that cooperation between
China and the development bank has reached a new stage, forming
the basis for eventual Chinese membership," the central bank said
in a statement.


"China's membership will help promote trade and economic
cooperation between China and Latin American countries," it said.


The 47-member IADB was set up in 1959. China has been an observer
since 1991, the central bank statement said.


China is raising its profile as a force to be reckoned with in
international development finance.


The most dramatic recent indication of this is China's hosting of
the annual meeting of the African Development Bank in Shanghai in
May.
