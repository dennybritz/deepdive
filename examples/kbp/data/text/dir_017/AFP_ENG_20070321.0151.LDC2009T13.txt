England coach Steve McLaren on Wednesday called up Charlton
defender Luke Young to join his squad for the Euro 2008
qualifiers with Israel and Andorra.


The 27-year-old full-back joins the squad after Manchester City's
Micah Richards underwent tests on a calf injury on Tuesday.


England play Israel in Tel Aviv on Saturday before travelling to
Barcelona to face Andorra the following Wednesday.


Young, who has won seven caps previously, last appeared for his
country in the thrilling 3-2 win over Argentina in Geneva in
November 2005.
