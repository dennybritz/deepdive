Chinese share prices put all recent turbulence behind them
Wednesday to post a record finish with a gain of 0.83 percent,
supported by follow-through buying and fresh inflows of funds,
dealers said.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, closed up 25.19 points at 3,057.38, an all-time high,
on turnover of 89.31 billion yuan (11.52 billion US dollars).


The previous record finish on the Shanghai Composite was 3,040.60
points on February 26, one day before a near nine percent
collapse sparked a global equity market sell-off.


The markets have been nervous in the aftermath of the Chinese
inspired sell-off but progressively investors have come back in
hope of further gains despite a series of strong economic data
which prompted another hike in interest rates at the weekend.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 26.38 points or 0.83 percent at
3,212.42 on turnover of 88.85 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index rose 11.44 points or 1.38 percent at 840.96, also a
record high, on turnover of 49.87 billion yuan.
