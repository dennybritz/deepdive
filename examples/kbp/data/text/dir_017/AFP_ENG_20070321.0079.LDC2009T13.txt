Iraqi Vice-President Tareq al-Hashemi used an interview Wednesday
to call for talks with insurgents in the country -- with the
exception of Al-Qaeda.


"I do believe there is no way but to talk to everybody," he said,
adding that militants were "just part of the Iraqi communities".


All parties "should be invited, should be called to sit down
around the table to discuss their fears, their reservations," he
said, while adding that Al-Qaeda was "not very much willing, in
fact, to talk to anybody".


In his comments published on the BBC's website, Hashemi noted
that many people in Iraq were "annoyed" that coalition troops in
the country were "damaging the dignity of Iraqis" but stressed
that they should stay "until further notice".


He also expressed discomfort that sectarianism was reflected in
the make-up of Iraq's government.


"(It) might be that the Iraqis need to be convinced that to break
up this polarisation we have to go for, first of all, election
system reform and second, to go for early elections," he told the
broadcaster.


Sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite factions causes
hundreds of deaths in Iraq every month.
