The International Finance Corp, the private investment arm ofthe
World Bank, said Wednesday it plans to invest at least 700
million dollars in China's private sector this year.


This figure surpasses the organisation's total investment of 639
million dollars in 2006 in 24 projects in the country, the IFC
said in a statement.


"The private sector has become a critical component of China's
economy. IFC seeks opportunities to finance local private
companies which have had limited institutional support," it said.


According to previous reports, the IFC and Bank of Nova Scotia
will pay more than two billion yuan for a combined 25 percent
stake in China's Dalian City Commercial Bank, with the IFC to
take probably a five percent holding.


The IFC also announced this month a 20 million dollars loan to
Shandong Weigao Pharmaceutical to support the development of
medical devices.


China is the IFC's fifth largest country portfolio and is one of
the IFC's fastest growing client countries.


From its first investment in 1985 until the end of 2006, IFC has
invested 3.16 billion dollars in 123 projects in China.
