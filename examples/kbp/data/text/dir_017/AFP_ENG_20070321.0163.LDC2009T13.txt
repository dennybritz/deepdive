Ukraine's parliament Wednesday approved Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a 32
-year-old pro- Western economist close to President Viktor
Yushchenko, as the country's new foreign minister.


Despite being dominated by pro-Russian parties, the 450-seat
parliament was almost unanimous in its support for his
appointment, with 426 votes in favour.


The foreign minister's post had been vacant since the end of
January, when the country's former chief diplomat, the Western-
oriented Borys Tarasyuk, resigned over conflicts with the pro-
Russian parliament.
