An Indonesian court Wednesday jailed three Islamic militants for
up to 20 years over the beheading of three Christian schoolgirls
in a crime that drew international condemnation.


The court sentenced Hasanuddin, alias Slamet Raharjo, who came up
with the idea to decapitate the girls in 2005 to mark a Muslim
holiday, to 20 years in prison.


"The accused was proven to plan and move other people to carry
out terror acts," Judge Binsar Siregar said.


A separate court sentenced two of Hasanuddin's accomplices, Lilik
Purnomo and Irwanto Irano, to 14 years in jail.


The schoolgirls were decapitated during a festival at the end of
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.


Their heads were left near a police post and a church in the
religiously divided district of Poso on Indonesia's Sulawesi
island.


Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the
killings while Pope Benedict XVI deplored what he described as
"barbaric murder."


Poso and its surrounding district have seen sporadic unrest since
violence between Muslims and Christians claimed around 1,000
lives in 2000 and 2001.
