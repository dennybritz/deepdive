At least 106 people have been killed in continuing clashes
between foreign Al- Qaeda militants and pro-government tribesmen
in northwest Pakistan, security officials said Wednesday.


Fighting broke out in the troubled South Waziristan tribal zone
on Monday after a local former Taliban commander ordered Uzbek
insurgents settled in the area to disarm.


The death toll includes 78 Uzbeks and 28 locals, with nearly half
of those dying in clashes since Tuesday night, the officials said
on condition of anonymity.
