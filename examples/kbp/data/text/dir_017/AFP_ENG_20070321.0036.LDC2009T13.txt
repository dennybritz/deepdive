The death toll from a fire that destroyed a nursing home in
southern Russia rose Wednesday to 63, officials said.


"A 66-year-old woman died of a heart attack after being
hospitalised. Doctors consider the condition of the remaining 29
as satisfactory," a spokeswoman for the Krasnodar regional
emergency situations ministry was quoted by Interfax news agency
as saying.


The residents of the two-storey brick building in the village of
Kamyshevatskaya, in rural southern Russia, were asleep when the
fire broke in the early hours of Tuesday, killing mainly elderly
patients and one nurse at the facility.


Violations of fire safety regulations have been widely cited in
Russian media reports as a critical factor in the deadly blaze
and a criminal investigation has been opened.


President Vladimir Putin ordered a national day of mourning for
Wednesday in memory of those killed in the fire and in two other
tragedies to hit Russia since Saturday: an explosion at a coal
mine in Siberia that killed at least 107 people and a plane crash
that killed six.
