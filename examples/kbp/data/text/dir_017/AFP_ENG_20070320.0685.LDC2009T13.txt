Two soldiers were killed Wednesday in pre-dawn attacks by
separatists in Thailand's Muslim-majority south, police said, as
the prime minister headed to the region.


A marine was killed and two others injured when militants
ambushed a patrol searching houses for insurgent activity in
Narathiwat province, police said.


A 22-year-old private was killed during the night when militants
opened fire on his house in Narathiwat, police added.


The attacks came as army-installed Prime Minister Surayud
Chulanont left Bangkok for Pattani province, where he was due to
meet with local officials about a recent surge in violence.


His visit comes just two days after Thailand's junta chief,
General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, travelled to nearby Yala province
to meet with local security officials.


The violence along Thailand's southern border with Malaysia has
escalated sharply since Sonthi seized power in a coup six months
ago.


The government has offered a series of peace gestures, but has
made little progress in identifying exactly who is behind the
shadowy militancy, which never claims responsibility for its
attacks.


More than 2,000 people have died since the unrest erupted three
years ago, but the attacks have become increasingly bloody,
including a massacre of nine Buddhist civilians one week ago.
