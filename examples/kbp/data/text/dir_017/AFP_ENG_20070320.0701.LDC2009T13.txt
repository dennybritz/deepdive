US computer maker Dell unveiled on Wednesday a low-priced
computer which it said was specifically designed for the Chinese
market and could help large numbers of novices to get online.


The Dell EC280, priced at between 2,599 and 3,999 yuan (335 and
515 dollars), was designed by engineers at Dell's China Design
Center located in Shanghai, the company told a briefing in the
east Chinese city.


"Today there are one billion people online worldwide and many of
the world's second billion users are right here in China," Dell
chief executive Michael Dell said in statement.


"We intend to earn their confidence and their business."


Dell's revenue in China increased by 26 percent in the company's
last fiscal year, according to the statement.


China had an estimated 137 million Internet users as of the end
of last year, state media reported earlier.
