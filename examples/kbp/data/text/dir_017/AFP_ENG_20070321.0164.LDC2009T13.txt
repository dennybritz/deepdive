East Timorese Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta said Wednesday that
he would take two weeks' leave from his job to campaign for the
presidential election.


"I will take two weeks off from my work starting March 23,"
Ramos-Horta told reporters after meeting with President Xanana
Gusmao, who will not be standing for re-election in the April 9
poll.


Ramos-Horta, seen as the favourite to win, said his deputy
Estanislau da Silva would "govern and fill in my position as
minister of defence."


The presidential poll will be the first since the former
Portuguese colony achieved independence in 2002 after 24 years of
Indonesian rule.


But there are fears that unrest could mar the vote in one of the
world's poorest nations.
