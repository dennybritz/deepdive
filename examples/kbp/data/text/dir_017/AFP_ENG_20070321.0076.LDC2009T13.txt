Tasmania built a challenging victory target for New South Wales
on the third day of the scheduled five-day Australian Sheffield
Shield cricket final here Wednesday.


The Tasmanians, looking to claim their maiden shield title in the
first final held in Hobart, reached 203 for six at the close for
a lead of 313 runs with two days left.


NSW will have to create competition final history to score enough
runs to win.


The highest successful fourth innings run chase in the 24-game
Shield final history was set by Victoria in 1990-91 when they
struck 239 for two to down NSW in Melbourne.


NSW fought back Wednesday after being dismissed for 230 and an
innings deficit of 110 runs.


Tasmania were travelling smoothly at 107 for two and an overall
lead of 217 before NSW hit back to claim 4-69 and remain with a
chance.


Fighting half-centuries by opener Michael Di Venuto (64) and
vice-captain George Bailey (50) looked to have seized the
initiative for Tasmania, only for NSW to fight back through
paceman Matthew Nicholson (3-52).


Tasmanian allrounder Luke Butterworth steadied the innings to be
unbeaten on 22 at stumps.
