Heavy clashes erupted Wednesday between Ethiopian forces backing
Somali troops and insurgents in southern Mogadishu where
guerrilla-style attacks are escalating, residents said.


The clashes come a day after African Union peacekeepers
reinforced security in the capital.


"Gunmen have attacked the defence ministry building and started
to open fire. The Ethiopians responded with unbelievable fire,"
said Mohamed Ali Nur, a resident.


"But they (Ethiopians) have responded and want to take over
Odweyne area from the gunmen," added Abdi Elmi Hassan, another
resident.
