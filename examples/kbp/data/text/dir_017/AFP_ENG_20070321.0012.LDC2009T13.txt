A gas explosion at a mine in northern China has left 21 workers
trapped, the government's work safety agency said Wednesday.


The accident occurred just after midnight on Sunday in Shanxi
province but local officials failed to immediately report the
accident, the State Administration for Work Safety said on its
website.


The site of the accident, the Miaojiang coal mine, is near
Jincheng city in Shanxi, China's coal mining heartland, it said.


China's mines are the most dangerous in the world with 4,746
miners dying in 2,845 accidents last year, according to official
figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
