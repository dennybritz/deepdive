Malaysian police Wednesday freed "Spiderman" Alain Robert after
the Frenchman was detained in his second attempt to scale the
nation's Petronas Twin Towers, a top security official said.


"The Frenchman was freed early today. No charges have been
recorded against him as yet," district assistant police
commissioner Mohamad Zulkarnain told AFP.


Robert was arrested on Tuesday two-thirds of the way through a
daredevil attempt to scale the iconic towers in the heart of
Kuala Lumpur using his bare hands.


The 44-year-old rock-climber, brandishing a Malaysian flag, was
grabbed by firemen waiting on the 60th floor of one of the
88-storey towers, once the world's tallest buildings. He was held
overnight at a local police station.


Mohamad said Robert had been freed on bail and his passport
impounded, and that government lawyers were examining police
reports to decide whether the Frenchman should be charged in
court for trespassing.


If found guilty, Robert could be fined 2,000 ringgit (570
dollars) or jailed for up a year, or both.


Mohamad said he was not sure when any charges might be brought.


Robert tried to scale the building a decade ago on March 20,
1997, but was freed without charge after that attempt.


He has been nicknamed "Spiderman" for his high-profile escapades,
which include climbing the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Golden
Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
