The Trinidad and Tobago Court of Appeals has overturned the
conviction and sentence of ex-prime minister Basdeo Panday, who
had been found guilty of failing to declare a London bank
account.


The three-judge panel's ruling clears the way for a retrial.


Justice Margot Warner said appeals court accepted the arguments
of Panday's attorney that the judge who ruled over Panday's case
was biased.


Panday, who was prime minister from 1995-2001, was found guilty
in April 2006 of failing to declare the account under the Public
Life and Integrity Act and sentenced to the maximum penalty of
two years in jail.


The conviction had cost Panday his seat in parliament.
