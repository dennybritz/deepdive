Wallaby back Lote Tuqiri said Wednesday he expects former
Kangaroos rugby league teammate Timana Tahu to become a Wallaby
in his first season after switching codes.


The Parramatta centre Tuesday signed a four-year deal with the
Australian Rugby Union beginning next year, when he will join
Tuqiri at the NSW Waratahs Super 14 franchise.


Tuqiri, who has played 50 Tests for the Wallabies since switching
from rugby league to union at the end of 2002, said Tahu's
signing was a coup for the 15-man code.


They played together in one rugby league Test against Great
Britain in 2002 in Sydney and Tuqiri has no doubts Tahu will
quickly join him as a dual international.


"I reckon he'll play for the Wallabies in his first year," Tuqiri
said Wednesday.


"He's carved up defences in all levels of rugby league and I
reckon he'll do that when he comes across."


The 26-year-old three-quarter has played five rugby league Tests
for Australia and 11 State of Origin games for NSW.


Waratahs coach Ewen McKenzie said Tahu possessed a number of
attributes the team could utilise.


"He's got a phenomenal try-scoring record in rugby league, he
just knows how to score tries, he's got size, he's got agility,
he's got speed," McKenzie said Wednesday.


Tahu wants to play in the outside-centre position.


"He and I have spoken about No.13 and I think the centres is
definitely where he wants to play and that's where I'm looking to
play him, McKenzie said.


Tuqiri currently occupies the 13 jersey at the Waratahs, but said
wing was where he felt most comfortable.
