Ten members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) were
arrested Wednesday after staging a sit-in protest at the
Zimbabwean embassy in London, the Metropolitan Police told AFP.


"There have been a total of 10 arrests for trespass on a
diplomatic premises: seven men and three women," a spokesman
said.


Regular police and officers from the Met's diplomatic protection
team were called to the embassy on the Strand, near Trafalgar
Square in central London, at about 9:10 am (0910 GMT) after the
10 got inside the building.


An MDC-UK spokesman, Ephraim Tapa, told AFP the protest was part
of a regular series of demonstrations and vigils outside the
embassy at President Robert Mugabe's repression of opposition in
Zimbabwe.


"What we're saying is that Mugabe appears to be intransigent.
He's defiant to the international community, he doesn't seem to
be listening to anybody, he continues to brutalise people in
Zimbabwe.


"We're saying that if we don't take action now, the abuse of
people is going to escalate as we move towards the 2008
elections.


"We're protesting against that repression by Mugabe and trying to
raise awareness, to try to keep the flame burning."
