Luo Yutong of China won the men's 1m springboard world title
Wednesday with a score of 477.40 points, handing his country
their third gold of the World Swimming Championships.


His compatriot He Chong took the silver with 469.85 points and
Christopher Sacchin of Italy earned the bronze by scoring 441.40.


Chinese divers have already won the 3m men's synchronised gold
and the women's 10m platform synchronised title with another
medal likely later Wednesday in the women's 10m platform.


Luo, from the southern Chinese city of Guangdong, only switched
from the 10m platform to springboard last year and won two titles
in the 3m synchro event with Xu Xiang on the Grand Prix circuit.


The 21-year-old showed his potential in the solo events by
grabbing silver in the 1m springboard at the 2006 World Cup in
Changshu.


Luo was always one step ahead of He, going through the
preliminary round and semi-final in the lead, progressively
bettering his dives before taking the gold before a spartan crowd
at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre.


He Chong, 19, went into the event as favourite, currently ranked
number one in the world in the 3m springboard, but failed to
impress the judges during the preliminary round.


He demonstrated a series of top-quality dives in the semi-final
earlier Wednesday but was unable to match Luo's near-perfect
dives in the final.


Sacchin dived consistently throughout the competition in what was
his first major final appearance.
