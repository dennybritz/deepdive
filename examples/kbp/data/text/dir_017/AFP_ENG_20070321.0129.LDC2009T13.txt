European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet sounded the
alarm on Wednesday about inflation risks in the 13 nations
sharing euro, raising the prospect of further interest rate
increases.


"In the policy relevant medium term, risks to price stability
remain on the upside," Trichet told the European Parliament
economic and monetary affairs committee in Brussels.


The Frenchman in particular warned about the impact of higher
wages on inflation and said that the ECB would keep a close eye
on negotiations between employers and workers.


However, a new surge in oil prices also remained a threat to
stable inflation in the eurozone.


In the short term, Trichet said he expected annual inflation to
fall in the spring and summer by comparisons with data last year,
when headline inflation surged owing to an oil price spike.


He then saw inflation rising in the second half of 2007, so that
annual inflation would be "hovering around two percent" at the
end of the year.


The ECB raised its key interest rates earlier this month to a
five-and-a-half- year high of 3.75 percent to keep inflation in
check and has left the door open to further increases if the
economy keeps gathering steam.


Trichet painted a favourable outlook for eurozone growth after a
strong start to the year.


"Looking ahead conditions remain in place for the euro area
economy to grow solidly," he said, pointing to firm domestic
demand, exports and business investment.
