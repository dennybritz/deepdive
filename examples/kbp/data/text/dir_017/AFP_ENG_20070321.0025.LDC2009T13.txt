A Malaysian minister has told domestic newspapers not to quote
from Internet blogs or use them as sources of information,
accusing the websites of spreading rumours, reports said
Wednesday.


Information Minister Zainuddin Maidin said most websites were
aimed at being provocative and were run by frustrated journalists
and political pundits, the Star daily reported.


"Do not quote them because you are disgracing yourself as you are
the authority. Do not give credit to such anarchist websites,"
Zainuddin was quoted as saying.


Malaysia's media is kept under tight control, while blogs have
seen an increase in popularity as Malaysians take to cyberspace
to discuss politics and social issues.


Blogs run by Malaysians in recent months have alleged corruption
by government figures in writings that later sparked mainstream
news reports.


"The information posted on the blog website may be something
provocative, politically motivated, inaccurate and is mostly
rumour floated for the interests of certain parties," Zainuddin
was quoted as saying by the state Bernama news agency.


The minister also called on Malaysians to regard blogs with
suspicion and refer to the mainstream media for the truth,
Bernama reported.


Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi earlier this year accused
Malaysians of using the Internet to rumour-monger.


Two bloggers are currently being sued by the government-linked
New Straits Times Press for defamation.
