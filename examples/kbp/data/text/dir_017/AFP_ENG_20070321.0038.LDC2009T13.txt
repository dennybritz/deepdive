A host of sporting superstars including NBA forward LeBron James
and Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney will
be on show in Macau this summer, the South China Morning Post
reported Wednesday.


Manchester United and American NBA teams the Cleveland Cavaliers
and the Orlando Magic will play exhibition games to celebrate the
opening of the 3.2-billion- dollar Venetian Macau-Resort hotel in
August, the report said.


It said the two NBA teams would play a two-game series, one in
Macau and another in Shanghai, while Manchester United would
travel to Macau as part of their Asian tour.


Macau is jostling with Las Vegas to be the world's biggest casino
draw. Its 22 casinos already pull in more money per year than the
40-odd casinos on the Vegas Strip -- last year the figure was
just short of seven billion dollars.


The relaxation of foreign ownership rules that ended tycoon
Stanley Ho's 40-year casino monopoly brought a flood of
investment from the United States and Hong Kong that has
rejuvenated the once moribund sector.
