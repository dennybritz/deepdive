Russia's food monitoring agency said Wednesday it had suspended
imports of chicken meat from three more German companies after
discovering salmonella in the produce.


The move is the latest in an ongoing dispute over meat imports
from the European Union.


"Rosselkhoznadzor has sent back to Germany 175.6 tonnes of
chicken meat from three Germany companies in which salmonella was
discovered and suspended imports of chicken from these
companies," the agency said.


Last week, the agency said it said had suspended imports from
three other German companies following the discovery of
salmonella in chicken meat.


The agency, which claims some recent EU meat exports have fallen
short of Russian sanitary standards, has warned it would halt all
imports of animal products from the bloc unless detailed sanitary
reports from each member state are provided by March 31.


In recent months salmonella has been found in meat deliveries
from Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, while listeria
has been discovered in Dutch meat imports, the agency said.
