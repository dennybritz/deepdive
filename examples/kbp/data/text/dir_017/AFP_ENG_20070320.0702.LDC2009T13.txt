Israeli troops on Wednesday shot dead a Palestinian during a
predawn raid on the outskirts of the West Bank city of Nablus,
medical and security sources said.


Saadi Abu Kisheq, 22, a member of Palestinian president Mahmud
Abbas's moderate Fatah movement, was killed during exchanges of
fire in the Askar refugee camp, the sources said.


The gunbattle erupted after several Israeli army jeeps had
entered the camp to carry out arrests, they said.


The army had no immediate comment.
