The death of Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer at the World Cup
is being treated as murder, a Pakistan team spokesman said
Wednesday.


"The police suspect that Woolmer may have been murdered. They
have started an investigation," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)
spokesman Pervez Mir told AFP.


Mark Shields, the deputy chief constable of the Jamaican police
force, confirmed that the death was being treated as suspicious.


"The post-mortem into the death of Mr Woolmer was inconclusive,"
he said.


"But having met with the pathologists and other medical
personnel, there is sufficient information to continue a full
investigation into the circumstances of Mr Woolmer's death which
is now being treated as suspicious."


Woolmer, 58, died in hospital on Sunday after being found
unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston.


His death came a day after Pakistan, the former world champions,
had been knocked out of the World Cup by Ireland.
