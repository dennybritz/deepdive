Chinese share price ended slightly higher in Wednesday morning
trade, after hitting an all-time high mid-session, with financial
and property stocks in favor, dealers said.


They noted the small final gain reflected subsequent profit-
taking after early support allowed the market to extend recent
gains.


"The market was buoyed by gains in overseas markets, as well as
follow-through buying in early morning which lifted the key index
to a new record," said Zhang Yidong, an analyst at Industrial
Securities.


"But there could be some correction around current levels because
some investors might choose to lock in gains for the moment,"
Zhang added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, ended the morning up 2.34 points at 3,034.54, after
hitting a new all-time high of 3,057.60.


The Shanghai Composite Index chalking up a closing record of
3,040.60 points on February 26, one day before a near nine
percent collapse sparked a global equity market sell-off.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 2.42 points or 0.08 percent at
3,188.45 and the Shenzhen A-share Index rose 4.81 points or 0.58
percent at 834.34, after hitting a record high of 839.28.
