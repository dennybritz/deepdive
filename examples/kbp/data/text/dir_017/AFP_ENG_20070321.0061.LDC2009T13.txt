The Australian government said Wednesday it wants a planned
cricket tour to Zimbabwe in September cancelled in the wake of
violence and human rights abuses in the southern African nation.


A final decision would, however, be left to the sport's governing
body Cricket Australia (CA).


"The government's present inclination is that we would prefer
that the tour did not go ahead," said Helen Coonan, the
government's deputy leader in the upper house of parliament.


Coonan said Canberra was appalled by the Zimbabwean government's
actions and hoped Cricket Australia would take that into
consideration when making a decision on whether to play three
one-dayers there in September.


"The position that Cricket Australia takes will be a matter for
them, but clearly the government's view will be drawn to their
attention," she said.


Under rules enforced by the International Cricket Council,
Cricket Australia must tour every ICC member country at least
once every five years or face fines totalling millions of
dollars.


The only way CA can avoid being fined by the ICC if it does not
tour is if it has a legitimate security concern or is prevented
from touring by the Australian government.


The regime of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has drawn
international criticism over its brutal crushing of dissent this
month, including the shooting of an activist and the beating of
several opposition leaders.
