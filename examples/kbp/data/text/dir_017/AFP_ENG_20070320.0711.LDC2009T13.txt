Sri Lanka Wednesday ordered tuberculosis sufferers to seek urgent
medical treatment or risk prosecution and forced hospitalisation.


"Fearing social ostracism and considering the six month period of
treatment, some TB patients do not come forward to seek
treatment," the ministry said, adding that each patient could
infect another 15 people.


"Those who neglect to seek treatment will be prosecuted, detained
and forced to undergo treatment in hospital," the statement said.


The health ministry said Sri Lanka had a good track record of
controlling the spread of TB, which was currently limited to five
for every 100,000 people in this nation of 19.5 million people.


It said it hoped to reduce the incidence of TB in Sri Lanka to
one in 100,000 by 2050, and sought public help to gather
information about TB sufferers in their neighbourhoods.


Sri Lanka offers free medical care to all its citizens, but state
hospitals are often overcrowded and lack medicine.
