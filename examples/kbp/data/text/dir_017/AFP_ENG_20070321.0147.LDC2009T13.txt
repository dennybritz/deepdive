Freed Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo on Wednesday
detailed his two- week ordeal in the hands of Afghanistan's
Taliban, calling his captors "without culture or human
experience."


"The Taliban are warriors first, people used to handling weapons,
using them, cleaning them, revering them," he said in a lengthy
account in his newspaper La Repubblica, two days after he was
released in exchange for the freedom of some Taliban fighters.


Weapons "were almost always their only friends," said the 52
-year-old veteran war correspondent, who returned home on
Tuesday.


"Cleaning their sole friend in life and battle was a ritual that
could take at least two hours a day," he wrote.


Mastrogiacomo described his captors, most between 20 and 25 years
old, "as poor young boys, without culture or human, sexual,
emotional or romantic experience."


They tried several times "sincerely" to convince him to convert
to Islam, he wrote.


The Taliban are hard to beat, Mastrogiacomo said. "They live on
the move all the time, they go home to their families once every
40 days. They have no salary and do everything for free. They
just like and enjoy fighting for their cause."


Mastrogiacomo, who was kidnapped March 4 with his Afghan driver
and interpreter, said Monday that he had witnessed the beheading
of the driver. The interpreter remains in captivity.
