Identical twins Jiang Tingting and Jiang Wenwen, with the help of
veteran Japanese coach Masayo Imura, are taking Chinese
synchronised swimming to a new level with an Olympic medal
beckoning.


The 20-year-old sisters finished fourth in the duet technical
routine final on Tuesday and followed it up Wednesday with a
solid fourth place in qualifying for the team technical final.


They attributed their strong performances to Imura, who guided
Japan to medals at all six Olympics since synchronised swimming
made its debut at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.


"Our Japanese coach is a lot more straight to us, the training
session is harder and focuses on the power component," said Jiang
Tingting.


"But she is also concerned for us a lot, she is a very nice
coach."


Jiang Wenwen added: "We have pulled out all the stops."


China has no background in synchronised swimming and Imura was
hired with the brief to win an Olympic medal.


Imura said the sisters had done well, but they still needed more
international experience before they could challenge heavyweights
Russia, Spain and Japan.


"They need more experience to perform better at international
events, so we don't care about the ranking. It's important for
those two girls to perform more powerfully," said the 56-year-
old.


"They did well today but one of the highlight leg figures did not
do well enough. I feel sorry about that.


"Synchronised swimming is not a show, it's a kind of sport, and
if it is a kind of sport, it needs to be powerful."
