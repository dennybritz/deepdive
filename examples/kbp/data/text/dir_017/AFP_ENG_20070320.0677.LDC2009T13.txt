The death of Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer is being treated
as suspicious, a Pakistan team spokesman said Wednesday.


"The police suspect that Woolmer may have been murdered. They
have started an investigation," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)
spokesman Pervez Mir told AFP.


A joint Jamaican police force and PCB press conference is being
held.
