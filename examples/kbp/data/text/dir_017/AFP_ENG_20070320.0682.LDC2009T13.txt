Tayshaun Prince scored 30 points to lead the Detroit Pistons past
Philadelphia 96-75 here Tuesday, giving Chris Webber a win over
his former National Basketball Association teammates.


Richard Hamilton scored 18 points and Ronald Murray added 12
points and seven assists for the Pistons, who shot 51 percent
from the field and forced 18 turnovers by the slumping 76ers.


Webber did not want to be part of the 76ers rebuilding after they
traded away Allen Iverson to Denver and so Philadelphia bought
out his contract and signed with his hometown Pistons, who lead
the Eastern Conference.


Webber managed only nine points but led Detroit with seven
rebounds.


The Pistons improved to 43-23 and stretched their edge over
Cleveland to 2 1/2 games in the fight for a home-court edge in
the East playoffs.


The 76ers fell to 26-42, five games out of the final playoff
spot, by losing for the fourth time in five games. Willie Green
led Philadelphia with 20 points.
