The head of French oil group Total, Christophe de Margerie, was
called in for questioning on Wednesday by police probing
suspected corruption in Iran and Cameroon, a source close to the
matter said.


Margerie would be questioned on suspicions of corruption to win a
gas contract in 1997 with the Iranian national oil company NIOC
to operate a gas field called South Pars, the source said.


The investigation was being conducted by the police finance
squad, the source said, after a report that Margerie was to be
questioned had appeared in the French regional newspaper Est
Republicain.


The probe had begun in December under investigating magistrates
Philippe Courroye and Xaviere Simeoni, and the police were acting
on orders from Courroye, the source said.


The newspaper had also reported that Margerie would be questioned
in connection with an enquiry begun on January 8 into suspected
"corruption of foreign agents" relating to the production and
marketing of oil from Cameroon.


The two enquiries resulted from information provided in November
2006 by a unit at the economy and finance ministry charged with
fighting money laundering, called Tracfin.


The newspaper also reported that several other senior executives
at Total had been called for questioning. It named them as
finance director Robert Castaigne, personnel director Jean-
Jacques Guilbaud, the head of gas operations Philippe Boisseau
and the head of a trading offshoot Patrick Rambeau.
