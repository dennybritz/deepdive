South Korea's air force chief is under fire for playing golf when
the country was mourning the death of a Korean soldier in
Afghanistan.


Military officials said Air Force Chief of Staff Kim Sung-Il
played a round with his subordinates on March 1, a national
holiday.


This was despite a verbal order from Defence Minister Kim Jang-
Soo, instructing senior military officials not to play golf until
after the March 5 funeral for Sergeant Yoon Jang-Ho.


Yoon died on February 27 in a bomb attack at the US Bagram air
base in Afghanistan. He was the first South Korean soldier to be
killed overseas since the Vietnam War.


Air force officials confirmed Kim Sung-Il played golf at a
military course but said he could not cancel the game.


"It was scheduled well before the bomb attack in Afghanistan," an
official told AFP on condition of anonymity. "Furthermore, he had
not received the defence minister's order."


The air force chief's two-year tenure ends in October but Yonhap
news agency said he may be forced to resign soon.


Golf has gained popularity in the country but is still regarded
with suspicion in some quarters as a game for the idle rich and
for people seeking to peddle influence.


Prime Minister Lee Hae-Chan and Vice Education Minister Lee Gi-
Woo stepped down after a golf outing with businessmen on March 1
last year sparked a criminal investigation into alleged
influence-peddling.


Harsh public criticism prompted the government's anti-graft body
to ban government officials from playing golf with suspect
partners.
