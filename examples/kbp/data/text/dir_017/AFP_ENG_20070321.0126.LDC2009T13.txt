Swiss insurance group Baloise reported a new leap in annual net
profit to 707 million Swiss francs (441 million euros, 583
million dollars) in 2006 on Wednesday, an increase of 75 percent
from performance in 2005.


Overall premium income for the full year declined by 1.8 percent
to 6.72 billion Swiss francs, mainly due to a continuing shift
away from the life insurance business, Baloise said in a
statement.


Investment income grew by 11.5 percent and overall business
volume expanded by 1.3 percent to 7.49 billion Swiss francs.


"The financial results are well above our expectations," said
chief executive Frank Schnewlin, underlining steady profit growth
since 2002 and high equity return ratios.


Baloise said it was aiming to maintain its growth in line with
market conditions and to expand profit per share.


The group also signalled its would take advantage of its
financial health to make "selective acquisitions."


Baloise had recorded an 80.7-percent increase in annual net
profit in 2005.
