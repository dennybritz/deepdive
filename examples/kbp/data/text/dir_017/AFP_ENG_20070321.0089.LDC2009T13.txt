The head of French oil group Total, Christophe de Margerie, was
called in for questioning on Wednesday by police probing
suspected corruption in Iran and Cameroon, a source close to the
matter said.


The investigation was being conducted by the police finance
squad, the source said, after a report that Margerie was to be
questioned had appeared in the French regional newspaper Est
Republicain.
