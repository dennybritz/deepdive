Teenagers who lock themselves in their bedrooms to blast out
heavy metal music may simply be trying to cope with the pressures
of being gifted, according to British research reported
Wednesday.


The study said that teenagers often work off the stresses and
strains of being a bright outsider by listening to bands such as
System Of A Down, Slipknot and Tool.


Researchers questioned more than 1,000 members of the National
Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth, whose members rank among
the brightest five percent of youngsters in Britain.


"There is a perception of gifted and talented students as being
into classical music and spending a lot of time reading.


"I think that is an inaccurate stereotype," Stuart Cadwallader, a
University of Warwick psychologist who is presenting the findings
to the British Psychological Society Wednesday, told the Daily
Telegraph.


"We are looking at a group with lower than average self-esteem
that does not feel quite as well adjusted.


"They feel more stressed out and turn to heavy metal as a way of
relieving that stress."


Cadwallader added that heavy metal fans often appreciate the
"complex and sometimes political themes" of the music.


"It has a tendency to worry adults a bit but I think it's just a
cathartic thing," he said.


"It does not indicate problems."


Many of heavy metal's biggest stars are closet geeks -- Brian
May, guitarist with Queen, is currently finishing a doctorate in
astrophysics, while Iron Maiden star Bruce Dickinson is a history
graduate, international fencer and qualified commercial pilot.
