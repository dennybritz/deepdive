Vials were found at a hotel where World Swimming Championship
competitors are staying, with small traces of illicit drugs
discovered on the box they were in, police said Wednesday.


They were discovered in a common area at the Parkview Hotel in
the beachside suburb of St Kilda that was also used by the
public.


"Victoria Police was notified on Tuesday, 20 March that a small
box had been found by hotel staff which contained several small
plastic vials of liquid and several other items," police said in
a statement.


"Those vials have since been tested by Victoria Police for
illicit drugs. The vials have been found to contain no illicit
drugs. Very small traces of illicit drugs were found within the
box.


"FINA and Australian Customs were notified at the time of the
incident along with the organising committee (of the world
championships)."


Final test results will be released in due course, police said.


Organising committee officials refused to say how many swimmers
were staying at the hotel but local reports said up to 20
national teams were residing there.


FINA had no immediate comment.


The 1998 world championships in Perth were overshadowed when
Human Growth Hormone was found in a Chinese competitor's luggage
and four Chinese swimmers tested positive for drugs.
