Jury selection has entered a second stage in the murder trial of
music producer Phil Spector, accused of killing a movie actress
who was found dead at his mansion four years ago.


Some 200 prospective jurors out of a pool of 300 were ordered
Tuesday to return to the Los Angeles court on April 16, when
attorneys for both sides will begin questioning them.


The prospective jurors have to fill out an 18-page questionnaire
which asks what knowledge they have of the case, the most high-
profile criminal trial in Los Angeles since the 1995 acquittal of
American football star O.J. Simpson in a double-murder case.


The remaining 100 potential jurors were excused over concerns
about possible conflicts of interest or hardship due to work
obligations.


Spector, 66, the reclusive musical genius who pioneered the "Wall
of Sound" recording technique, is accused of shooting dead Lana
Clarkson at his neo-gothic estate on February 3, 2003.


Prosecutors say Spector killed Clarkson, a B-movie actress, after
meeting her for the first time at the Hollywood nightclub where
she worked as a hostess. She was dead by the next morning at his
home.


Spector, who a few weeks before the shooting described himself as
"relatively insane" and tortured by "devils inside me," has
strongly denied murder, telling Esquire magazine in 2003 that
Clarkson shot herself.
