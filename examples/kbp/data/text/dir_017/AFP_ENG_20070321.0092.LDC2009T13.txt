Three more people have been arrested after the latest in a spate
of fatal stabbings in London left a 15-year-old boy dead, police
said Wednesday.


Adam Regis, nephew of retired Olympic sprinter John Regis, was
found by his grandmother with stab wounds late Saturday in east
London, near Premiership football club West Ham's ground.


On Tuesday morning, officers from London's Metropolitan Police
arrested a 17 -year-old boy in connection with their inquiry.


That evening, they also arrested three men aged 19, 20 and 22 at
an address in Beckton, east London.


"We stress that the investigation continues and that all our
points of appeal remain," a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.


"All lines of inquiry remain open".


Regis's death came amid growing concern among politicians that
there is a knife and gun culture among young people in the
British capital.


Last week, another young Briton, Kodjo Yenga, was killed in a
knife attack in Hammersmith, west London, while last month, armed
police went on patrol in some parts of London after the fatal
shootings of four youngsters within days.


Prime Minister Tony Blair called the killings "horrific, shocking
and tragic beyond belief" and said there was a "specific problem"
among some groups of young people.
