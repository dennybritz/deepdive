Sri Lankan troops and Tiger rebels fought a pitched battle in the
island's restive east Wednesday, killing at least 12 from both
sides and wounding more than 30, military officials said.


The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched a pre-
dawn mortar attack on an army camp at Sittandy in the district of
Batticaloa, killing four soldiers and wounding about 30, a local
military official said.


"Troops retaliated in kind and we have captured the bodies of
eight Tigers," a military official in the area said by telephone.
He said more than a dozen civilians in the neighbourhood had also
been wounded.


The LTTE said in a statement that eight civilians had gone
missing in the district of Batticaloa on Tuesday, but gave no
details of the latest fighting in the east.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
since December 2005 between government troops and rebels fighting
for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority.


The fighting comes despite a truce that has been in place, at
least on paper, since February 2002.
