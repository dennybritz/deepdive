Israel's main labour union launched an open-ended general strike
on Wednesday which threatens to paralyse essential services,
including the international airport, ports and government
offices.


The Histadrut union announced the strike began at 9 am (0700 GMT)
after last- minute reconciliation efforts failed to resolve a row
over unpaid public servant wages.


"The strike will continue until all civil servants receive their
wages," Histadrut secretary general Ofer Eini told a press
conference on Tuesday.


Despite the union action, a plane carrying the English football
team heading for Israel for a crucial Euro 2008 qualifier will be
allowed to land, an airport authority spokesman told AFP.


The fate of the 5,000 English fans due in Israel to cheer on
their team remains uncertain however.


Eini said the strike was being held to protest against unpaid
salaries in the public sector. The union claims that around 3,700
employees in 40 local councils have gone without pay for months.


The Israeli treasury says the wages of only 600 employees are in
dispute and that it will take a few days to sort out the problem.


Last month, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert averted another threatened
strike by the union after he promised to resolve the unpaid wages
crisis.
