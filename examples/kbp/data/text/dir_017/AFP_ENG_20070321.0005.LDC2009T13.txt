Indonesian police said Wednesday one man was shot dead, another
injured and several arrested in a raid on suspected militants
from an Al-Qaeda-linked terror group.


The arrested suspects were "believed to be part of Abu Dujana's
group," police spokesman Sisno Adiwinoto said, referring to the
man thought to be acting leader of regional terror group Jemaah
Islamiyah (JI).


JI has been blamed for a string of attacks, including the 2002
Bali bombings that killed 202 people.


One suspect was shot dead and another wounded when the arrests
were made Tuesday in Yogyakarta, on Indonesia's main island of
Java, Adiwinoto said.


He identified them by their initials, saying the dead man was
MAS, 39, and the injured suspect SP, 40.


"Several other suspects have been taken to help hunt down
others," Adiwinoto said.


Dujana is one of Indonesia's ten most wanted people and said to
be a close associate of the man who heads that list, fugitive
militant Noordin Mohammad Top.


Earlier reports had suggested Dujana had been captured in
Tuesday's operation.


But Inspector General Bekto Suprapto, the head of the police's
anti-terror unit, told AFP that Dujana was not among those
arrested, killed or wounded.
