Laotian President Choummaly Sayasone and his wife arrived in
military-run Myanmar on Wednesday for a three-day goodwill visit,
an information ministry official said.


Choummaly, who is also head of the ruling Lao People's
Revolutionary Party, was greeted by Myanmar's junta leader
General Than Shwe, the official said.


"The Laos president and his wife arrived in Naypyidaw at about
11:00 am (0430 GMT) this morning on a special flight," the
official told AFP by phone from Naypyidaw.


"They were welcomed by our Senior General Than Shwe and his wife.
It's just a goodwill visit," he added.


Choummaly and his wife, Keosaychay Sayasone, will spend the night
in Naypyidaw, Myanmar's new administrative capital about 400
kilometres (250 miles) north of Yangon, before visiting the
central city of Mandalay on Thursday.


The president will fly out of Yangon on Friday evening, the
official said.


Myanmar and communist Laos share a small border, and are among
the poorest countries in Asia.
