Hong Kong share prices finished the Wednesday morning session
0.18 percent weaker in lackluster trade as investors await China
Mobile's 2006 results, due after the close, dealers said.


They said many also moved to the sidelines ahead of the US
Federal Reserve's decision later Wednesday on interest rates and
its comments on the economic outlook.


China Mobile saw some profit-taking but the market's downside was
limited by gains in Henderson Land and Wharf Holdings ahead of
their earnings announcements.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning down 33.97 points at
19,322.93, off a low of 19,270.72 and a high of 19,408.07.
