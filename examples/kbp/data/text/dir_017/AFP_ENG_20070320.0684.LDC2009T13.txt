Reigning 100m and 200m breaststroke world record holder Leisel
Jones is confident a Chinese swimmer will breakthrough at the
world championships to replace the recently retired Luo Xuejuan.


Jones, who also holds the 100m and 200m world titles, said it was
almost inevitable.


"I wouldn't be surprised at all if one came out of the woodwork
at this meet," said the 21-year-old, who is hot favourite to
retain her titles next week.


"It will be very interesting. I know they have depth,
particularly in the women's breaststroke, and it is only a matter
of time now that Luo has retired that someone else will take her
place.


"If there is someone coming through, then that is good. It means
more competition for me."


Luo is the reigning Olympic 100m breaststroke champion and was
seen as a  top Chinese hope for the 2008 Beijing Games, but she
announced her retirement in January at the age of 23 due to
potentially fatal heart problems.


China has brought a relatively young and inexperienced team to
Melbourne with the ultimate focus being the Beijing Olympics.


In the women's breaststroke events, hopes will rest with Qi Hui,
Luo Nan and Ji Liping.
