Israel's main workers' union Histadrut on Wednesday postponed for
three hours the start of an open-ended general strike to protest
over unpaid civil servant wages.


The strike was to have begun Wednesday at 6:00 am (0400 GMT) but
was called off for three hours as a last reconciliation attempt,
the union said.


Histadrut's secretary general Ofer Eini told a press conference
on Tuesday, "the strike will continue until all civil servants
receive their wages."


Eini said the union was calling for the strike to protest against
unpaid salaries in the public sector. The union claims that
employees in around 40 local councils have gone without pay for
months.


If it goes through, the strike could paralyse the country's
essential services, including its international airport and all
its ports, as well as all government offices.


On February 27, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert averted
another threatened strike by the union after he promised to
resolve the unpaid wages crisis.
