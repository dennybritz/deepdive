Vietnam has legalised the Bahai faith, which authorities say has
about 7,000 followers in the communist country, the state-
controlled media reported Wednesday.


Nguyen Huu Oanh, vice chairman of the government's Religious
Affairs Committee, "presented a certificate to ratify religious
activities of the Vietnam Bahai religious community," said the
Vietnam News Agency.


Human rights and religious freedom groups routinely criticise
Vietnam for violating religious freedoms, including the
harassment of some Buddhist groups and members of mainly
Christian Protestant ethnic minorities.


Vietnam pledged greater religious freedom in a government report
issued in early February and said that more than 20 million of
its 84 million citizens were state-registered followers of major
religions in 2005.


The Bahai faith, which stresses the unity of humanity and its
religions, was founded in Iran in 1844 and has over five million
followers worldwide, according to the official Bahai website in
the United States.
