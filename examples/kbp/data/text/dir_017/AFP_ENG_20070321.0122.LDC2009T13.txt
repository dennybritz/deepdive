Russia has agreed to ratchet up pressure on Iran gradually but
opposes sudden and "excessive" UN sanctions in response to
Tehran's refusal to curb its nuclear program, Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov said here Wednesday.


"We agreed earlier to act on Iran gradually, in proportion to the
actual situation, and we will not support excessive sanctions,"
Lavrov said during an appearance in the Russian parliament.


He said proposals to include a ban on foreign travel for senior
Iranian officials and a freeze on international loans had been
removed from new sanctions under discussion among six major
powers at the United Nations in New York.


Lavrov spoke a day after the Russian ambassador to the United
Nations denied US press reports that Moscow had threatened to
withhold nuclear fuel for Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant if Tehran
failed to meet UN demands to suspend uranium enrichment.


"I can tell you that the report is not accurate, that there has
been no Russian ultimatum to Iran of any kind," the Russian
ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, told reporters.


"We continue to regard the Bushehr project as something that is
outside the scope" of the UN sanctions resolutions.
