Thousands of South Korean doctors and dentists went on strike
Wednesday to protest government plans to reform medical services.


The government has published a bill that would let hospitals
provide both traditional Oriental and Western medical services,
along with dentistry. Most hospitals currently offer only one of
the services.


The bill also calls for the introduction of doctors who can work
in multiple clinics or hospitals, rather than being confined to
one institution.


It requires doctors to disclose in advance those treatment costs
not covered by insurance and to give patients full explanations
of their symptoms and how they will be treated.


The Korea Medical Association said some 50,000 Western and
Oriental doctors and dentists were expected to rally in Seoul
late Wednesday. It was not clear whether their strike would
continue for more than one day.


The association, which has 95,000 members, said it feared the
bill would "damage our specialities and rights."


"The government must not push for a revision to the medical law
without full consultations with us," it said in a statement.


The Ministry of Health and Welfare rejected the association's
demands and threatened to take legal action against doctors if
they continue to refuse to accept patients.


It plans to present the bill to parliament in the first half of
the year.


South Korean doctors are notorious for refusing to communicate
with patients about their ailments.


Doctors insist the bill would lower the quality of specialists
and affect public health.
