A top aide to embattled World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz
resigned Monday, saying the controversy surrounding the
development lender made it difficult to be effective.


Kevin Kellems, speaking to AFP by telephone, said he had resigned
to pursue other opportunities.


"Given the current environment surrounding the leadership of the
World Bank Group, it is very difficult to be effective in helping
to advance the mission of the institution," he said.
