Argentine football legend Diego Maradona has been released from a
Buenos Aires rehab clinic after a more than two-week stay for for
alcohol abuse, media here reported, quoting his personal
physician.


The Clarin newspaper reported that Maradona left the clinic
Sunday. His personal physician, Alfredo Cahe, told the paper that
the former football star would continue to be treated on an
outpatient basis three times per week.


A source at the facility where the football star had been treated
since April 21 also confirmed that Maradona had been cleared to
leave.


Maradona, 46, who has struggled with cocaine and alcohol abuse
for years, was hospitalized for in April suffering from hepatitis
linked to heavy drinking.


Maradona, regarded as one of the greatest figures in world
football, played for Barcelona and Napoli and captained his
country to victory in the 1986 World Cup.


But his career on and off the field has been marred by repeated
drug and alcohol abuse. The ex-Argentina World Cup captain and
Barcelona star was hospitalized in 2000 and 2004 for heart
attacks provoked by drug abuse.
