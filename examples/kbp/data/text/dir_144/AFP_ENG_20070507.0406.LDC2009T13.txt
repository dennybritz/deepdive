US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will head to Moscow next
week for talks with her Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov, her spokesman Sean McCormack said Monday.


"There are a lot of issues to talk about in the US-Russia
strategic relation, spanning from nuclear non-proliferation to
missile defense to the development of democracy in Russia,"
McCormack told reporters.


He said it was also possible that Rice will make a stop somewhere
in the Middle East. He made clear that the visit likely will not
be to Israel, although a trip there is on a future agenda.


"We are taking a look at exactly when is the right time for her
to make the visit to the Israelis and the Palestinian
Territories," McCormack said.


A State Department official said Monday that Rice would take part
in a meeting of the Quartet major powers involved in Mideast
peace, to be held at an undetermined location in Egypt.
