The captors of a Belarussian woman abducted in Nigeria are
seeking a 1.2 million-dollar (880,000-euro) ransom for her
release, the RIA Novosti new agency quoted a diplomat in Lagos as
saying on Monday.


Irina Ekpo-Umo, who was seized in southern Nigeria on Saturday,
is "alive and her condition ... is satisfactory," said Viktor
Goncharov, an official at the Russian embassy, which is acting on
Belarus' behalf in the matter.


"So far the bandits have made no other demands," he said.


Police in Nigeria's oil capital Port Harcourt earlier said the
woman, who is married to a Nigerian, was working for a catering
company.


While kidnappings of foreigners are a regular occurrence in
southern Nigeria, is is unusual for a woman to be targeted.


Goncharov said the Russian embassy was working closely with her
employer and with law enforcement agencies to secure her release.
