Sri Lanka Monday summoned a top UN food agency official and
accused the organisation of trying to shield "the criminal acts"
of Tamil Tiger rebels.


Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama summoned World Food
Programme country director Jeff Taft-Dick to complain that the
agency had failed to report the abduction of two of its staff by
Tamil Tiger rebels.


The two local aid workers were abducted early last month while
carrying out relief work in the rebel-held territory of
Kilinochchi, 330 kilometres (210 miles) north of Colombo.


The UN reported the missing aid workers to the government late
April, the foreign ministry said but did not say why the world
body failed to bring it to Colombo's notice earlier.


Bogollagama said "the circumstances relating this incident could
be perceived as an attempt by the UN authorities in Sri Lanka to
shield the LTTE's (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) criminal
actions."


Taft-Dick had told Bogollagama that the LTTE had released one aid
worker and promised to review the other one's release.


The LTTE has been fighting for an independent homeland for
minority Tamils in a bloody conflict that has claimed more than
60,000 lives since 1972.
