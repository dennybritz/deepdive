Toronto terror suspects arrested last year in an alleged plot to
blow up public buildings and behead Canada's prime minister will
ask to be released Monday, saying their detention is
unconstitutional, a court official told AFP.


Attorneys for the Muslim men and boys caught in a massive police
June 2006 sting operation will argue in court that being held in
isolation in tiny prison cells is cruel and unusual punishment,
not administrative segregation as authorities have claimed, a
spokesman for the Public Prosecution Service said.


"They're asking for a bail review," spokesman Daniel Brien said.


Five of the 18 suspects already have been released under strict
bail conditions pending trial.


The suspects, charged under Canada's anti-terrorism laws, are
accused of hatching a plan to storm parliament and take hostages,
hoping to force Ottawa to withdraw its 2,300 troops from
Afghanistan.


If their demands were not met, the hostage-takers intended to
behead their captives, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper,
and also planned to bomb several public buildings in Toronto,
according to court documents.


Police said the members of the group purchased what they thought
was three tonnes of ammonium nitrate -- a fertilizer that can be
used to make explosives -- but authorities tracking their moves
had substituted a harmless substance.
