A former employee of the Vatican was given a suspended four-month
prison sentence for possessing cocaine, in a first for the Holy
See's justice system, his lawyer said Monday.


The employee was fired around six months ago after an Italian
court convicted him of drug dealing, the lawyer, Gianluigi
Mattioli, told AFP.


Following the conviction, police searched the employee's office
at the Vatican and found a stash of cocaine in a desk drawer.


The Vatican tribunal on Saturday found him guilty of possessing
87 grammes (three ounces) of cocaine, Mattioli said.


The unprecedented verdict was reached after three hours of
deliberation.


It was a tricky case because the Vatican justice system still
relies on the Italian penal code of 1865, which has no provisions
for drug possession, Mattioli told AFP.


A law dating from 1929 allowed the judges to punish a crime that
is not on the books, he added.


Mattioli's client does not plan to appeal the conviction.


Vatican City is an independent state within Rome covering an area
of 0.44 square kilometres (0.17 square miles), with about 900
inhabitants and a crime rate that is much lower than Italy's.
