US President George W. Bush gave Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and
her husband a red-carpet welcome to the White House Monday, in
the first formal British royal visit here in 16 years.


Bush and the queen stood somberly on a dais set up on the south
lawn of the presidential mansion while the anthems of both
countries played and their respective flags fluttered in the
breeze.
