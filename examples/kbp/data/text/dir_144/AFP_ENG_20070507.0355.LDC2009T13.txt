Some 200 protestors, most of them high-school students, staged a
rowdy protest against rightwing president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy
on Monday.


Blocking traffic with metal barriers and camping in the centre of
the road near the Place de la Bastille -- the scene of violent
clashes with police the night before -- the demonstrators urged
drivers to show their support by honking their horns.


Chanting "Sarko, Fascist, the people will get you!" and "Sarko,
Rabble, you've got to go!" -- referring to Sarkozy's notorious
description of young troublemakers as "racaille" -- they draped a
French flag scrawled with the slogan "Resist Sarkozy" across the
steps of the Bastille Opera house.


Sarkozy's election on Sunday sparked wild celebrations in the
capital, but also fiery protests by disappointed left-wing
supporters that turned nasty in Bastille and half a dozen other
cities.


Several hundred cars were torched by youth gangs in the same
high-immigration suburbs hit by riots in 2005, but the country
was spared the large-scale eruption of violence which some of
Sarkozy's rivals had predicted.
