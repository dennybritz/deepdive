Three police officials were arrested in India's western Gujarat
state for their alleged role in the controversial murder of a
Muslim couple, a report said Monday.


Three other senior officials were arrested last month in the same
case, after the Gujarat government admitted in court that a man
falsely accused of killing the state's chief minister had been
killed in a staged gunbattle.


The government later told the court that Sohrabuddin Sheikh's
wife had also been killed and burned, allegedly to destroy
evidence.


The three policemen arrested Monday have been charged with
abduction, illegal confinement and murder, the Press Trust of
India reported, citing unnamed investigators.


Sheikh was shot after being accused of plotting to kill Gujarat
Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who has been blamed for sectarian
riots which left at least 1,000 people dead, mostly Muslims, in
the state in 2002.
