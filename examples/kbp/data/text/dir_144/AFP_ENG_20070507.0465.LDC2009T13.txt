Andriy Shevchenko will have a groin operation on Tuesday that
rules the Chelsea striker out of the FA Cup final against
Manchester United.


Shevchenko has missed Chelsea's last two matches with the problem
and the London club have decided to go for the surgery now rather
than wait until the end of the season as orginally planned.


The injury caps a miserable first season at Stamford Bridge for
Shevchenko, who has failed to live up to his illustrious
reputation since his 30 million pounds transfer from AC Milan
last year.


A statement on Chelsea's website revealed the decision to operate
on the Ukranian: "Andriy Shevchenko will have a groin hernia
operation on Tuesday.


"The decision was taken by the Chelsea medical department to
bring the operation forward. It had orginally been scheduled for
the end of the season."
