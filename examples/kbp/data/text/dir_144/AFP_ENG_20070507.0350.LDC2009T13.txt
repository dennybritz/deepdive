US President George W. Bush sees "real opportunities" to work
with French president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy, despite some likely
frictions, the White House said Monday.


"The president always hopes for close relations with France," and
expects to meet with Sarkozy at a summit of industrialized
nations in Germany next month, spokesman Tony Snow told
reporters.


"Despite some frictions, we continued to work closely with France
on a number of important issues during President Chirac's
government, and we certainly look forward to cooperation with the
French and we know that there's going to be areas of
disagreement," said Snow.


"But on the other hand there is certainly real opportunities to
work together on a broad range of issues," Snow said after
Sarkozy, a rightwinger who has unabashedly praised the United
States, won a convincing victory.


Sarkozy scored an emphatic 53-47 percent victory over Socialist
Segolene Royal, winning an unambiguous mandate for his program of
tax cuts, work incentives and curbs on union powers.
