Biotechnologists have engineered brewer's yeast so that it glows
green in response to an ingredient found in land mines, according
to a study published online on Monday.


Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast used in baking as well as
brewing, was engineered so that it had an "olfactory pathway"
that responded to airborne molecules of DNT.


DNT -- chemical name 2,4-dinitrotoluene -- is a residue from the
making of the explosive TNT. Dogs trained to sniff for explosives
are believed in fact to be trained to detect DNT.


A gene found in rats was spliced into the yeast's genome so that
the surface of its cells reacted in response to DNT, the paper
says.


To get a visual cue as to whether this "nose" had detected DNT,
the team also added a gene to turn the yeast a fluorescent green
when contact was made.


The authors, led by Danny Dhanasekaran of Temple University
School of Medicine in Philadelphia, believe they have found a
useful, if so far experimental, addition to "biosensors" --
gadgets that use organisms to detect biological or chemical
weapons of mass destruction.


The research is published by Nature Chemical Biology, a journal
of the London- based Nature group.
