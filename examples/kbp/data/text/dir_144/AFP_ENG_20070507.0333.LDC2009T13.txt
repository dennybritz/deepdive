An explosion Monday in Ukraine knocked out of service one of the
main pipelines exporting Russian natural gas to the European
Union, the Ukrainian emergency situations ministry told AFP.


A ministry spokesman said there had been a "large explosion" on
the pipeline, which carries Siberian gas through Ukraine to
Germany and other EU clients.
