An explosion Monday in Ukraine knocked out of service one of the
main pipelines exporting Russian natural gas to the European
Union, the Ukrainian emergency situations ministry told AFP.


A "large explosion" cut the pipeline, which carries Siberian gas
through Ukraine to Germany and other EU clients, ministry
spokeswoman Viktoria Ruban said.


The blast occurred at about 1125 GMT on a section near the
Ukrainian capital Kiev, she said.


A 30-metre (32-feet) length of pipeline was torn off, with debris
hurled 150 metres away.


There was no immediate information regarding the effect of the
incident on deliveries to the European Union, the biggest foreign
gas market for Russia, the world's leading natural gas producer.
