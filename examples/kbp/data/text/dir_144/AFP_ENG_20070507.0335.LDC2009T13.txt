US President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh on Monday discussed efforts to ratify a landmark nuclear
deal, according to White House spokesman Tony Snow.


"They welcomed the recent progress in the civil nuclear
cooperation intiative. They also agreed on the need for
negotiations to conclude the bilateral agreement on peaceful
nuclear cooperation," Snow told reporters.


Bush, who spoke to Singh by telephone, also underscored the
importance of a "successful outcome in the Doha Round," the
stalled global free trade negotiations, said Snow.


Indian officials have said that the nuclear pact has hit a fresh
snag with senators in Washington piling the pressure on New Delhi
to keep its distance from Iran.


Although the US Congress agreed in December to let talks on the
energy deal move forward, Indian and US officials are still at
odds over the fine print of an accord seen as the centerpiece of
a new post-Cold War relationship.


There was some cause for optimism after talks in Washington
earlier this week, with Indian diplomats saying problem issues
like the treatment of spent fuel and India's right to test
nuclear weapons could be overcome.


But in the aftermath of the talks on how India should get
previously forbidden nuclear technology, seven US senators wrote
to Singh telling him not to cozy up too much with Iran.


Washington is trying to isolate Tehran over its disputed nuclear
program and alleged support for terrorism.
