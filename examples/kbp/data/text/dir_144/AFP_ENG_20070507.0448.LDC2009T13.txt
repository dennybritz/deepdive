A meeting on Africa's air safety opened in the Ethiopian capital
Monday as investigators in Cameroon began a probe into the
weekend crash of a brand new Kenya Airways jet which killed 114
people.


The third African Union meeting of experts and aviation ministers
is due to focus on security and the creation of a single
continental air space, an official told AFP.


Several dozen technical experts from the African Union's 53
member countries began meeting Monday ahead of a ministerial
meeting at the end of the week.


Kenya Airways flight KQ 507 vanished from radar screens in a
violent storm shortly after it took off from Douala, Cameroon,
early Saturday, on its way to Nairobi.


The wreckage was found more than 36 hours later, 20 kilometres
(12 miles) southeast of Cameroon's economic capital.
