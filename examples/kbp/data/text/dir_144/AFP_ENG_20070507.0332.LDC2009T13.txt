Nigeria's next president Umaru Yar'Adua left Monday on a tour of
seven African countries, his first foreign trip since being
elected in April, his spokesman said.


Yar'Adua was starting with a day trip to Begin and Togo before
completing the tour with visits to Niger, Senegal, South Africa,
Algeria and Libya and returning on Thursday.


"The President-elect is expected to hold talks with Presidents
and Heads of Government of the countries including discussions
with various professional and interest groups," read a statement
from his spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu.


Yar'Adua succeeds Olusegun Obasanjo, who is due to step down on
May 29 after serving as Nigerian president for two terms and a
total of eight years.
