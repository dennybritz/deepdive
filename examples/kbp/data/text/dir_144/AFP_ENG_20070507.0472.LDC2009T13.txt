Zimbabwe released two human rights lawyers on Monday arrested
last week after challenging government attempts to deny bail to
jailed opposition activists, their lawyer said.


Lawyer Lawrence Chibwe said Alec Muchadehama and partner Andrew
Makoni, arrested on Friday, were released on 500,000 Zimbabwean
dollars (about 2,000 US dollars) bail each after being charged
with obstructing the course of justice.


"The prosecution said they wrote some statements, in a bail
application to the high court for some detained opposition
officials and activists, that amounted to defeating or
obstructing the course of justice," Chibwe told AFP.


The lawyers were representing a member of parliament for the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and 12 other
activists accused of petrol bombing government properties.


Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi claimed the 13 activists had
received military training in South Africa with a view to
destabilising the Zimbabwean government, and that police were
still investigating the bombings.
