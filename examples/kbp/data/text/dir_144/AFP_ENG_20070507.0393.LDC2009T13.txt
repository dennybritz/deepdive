Foreign ministers from 53 African nations started gathering in
South Africa's eastern coast city Durban on Monday for a two-day
meeting on political and economic integration on the continent.


The African Union (AU) foreign ministers' meeting, which begins
Tuesday, was expected to lay the groundwork for a summit
gathering African heads of state and government in Accra, Ghana,
in July, according to a statement from South Africa's foreign
ministry.


"The matter of the political and economic integration of Africa
is a long- standing issue and a historic debate that will not end
until we reach this destiny," Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-
Zuma said in the statement.


He pointed out that the issue of integration was hotly debated at
the founding conference of the AU's predecessor, the Organisation
for African Unity, in Addis Ababa in 1963.


"Eventually it was decided by the founding fathers to form the
OAU mainly to unite the African continent, build solidarity among
Africans and free Africa of the yoke of colonialism," Dlamini-
Zuma said.


"The debate has nonetheless continued throughout the history of
our continent. Today, no one disputes the need for a united
Africa in whatever form. We all agree this remains our
objective," he added.
