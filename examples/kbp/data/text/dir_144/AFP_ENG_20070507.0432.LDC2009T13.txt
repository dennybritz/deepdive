Some finance ministers from countries sharing the euro warned
French president elect Nicolas Sarkozy against putting pressure
on European Central Bank as he said he would during the campaign.


The French rightwinger made frequent attacks against the ECB
before he was elected on Sunday, urging a review of the
Frankfurt-based central bank's mandate, which is currently
focused on keeping inflation low.


"He may increase the pressure, but it is not a good idea," Dutch
Finance Minister Wouter Bos told journalists as he arrived for a
meeting with his eurozone counterparts in Brussels.


Likewise German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck warned: "With
regards to the reputation and credibility of the European Central
Bank, we should refrain from putting any restrictions on the
bank."


While welcoming Sarkozy's election as a "wise decision" by French
voters, Austrian Finance Minister Wilhelm Molterer said: "No one
should put pressure on the bank."


In one of his most fiery speeches during the campaign, Sarkozy
called in late March for a Europe-wide "diplomatic offensive" to
rein in the ECB, which he blamed for the strong euro.


"I want to launch a diplomatic offensive to persuade our partners
to put pressure on the ECB and, more importantly, put in place a
real economic government of Europe in the face of a central bank
that is not accountable to anyone," Sarkozy said.


People close to Sarkozy say that he has since given that idea up.
