At least eight wedding guests died and two were missing after an
overloaded boat capsized at the weekend on a river linking
Senegal to Mauritania, police said Monday.


"Of the 10 people who disappeared, we have retrieved eight bodies
and the search continues," Senegalese police spokesman Daouda
Diop told AFP.


They were part of a group of 43 aboard a dug-out canoe who were
crossing the Senegal river from Mauritania to attend a wedding
ceremony.


Diop said the boat was overloaded. The boat's coxswain is being
held by police in the northeastern Senegalese town of Matam.


Shipping accidents are frequent on Africa's rivers and lakes
where people are often forced to take unworthy or overloaded
vessels.
