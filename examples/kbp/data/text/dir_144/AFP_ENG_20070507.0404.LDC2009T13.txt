An explosion Monday in Ukraine knocked out of service one of the
main pipelines exporting Russian natural gas to the European
Union, but was not expected to affect supplies, officials said.


A "large explosion" cut the pipeline, which carries Siberian gas
through Ukraine to Germany and other EU clients, said Viktoria
Ruban, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian emergency situations
ministry.


The blast occured at about 1125 GMT on a section near the
Ukrainian capital of Kiev, she said.


A 30-metre (32-foot) length of pipeline was torn off, with debris
hurled 150 metres (164 feet) away.


However, Russian gas exporting monopoly Gazprom said deliveries
would still reach clients.


"No limits on gas supplies to European customers have occurred,"
Gazprom said in a statement.


The European Union is the biggest foreign gas market for Russia,
the world's leading natural gas producer.


Emergency services put out a fire at the scene and investigators
were working to uncover the cause of the explosion, the Ukrainian
state gas company Naftogaz said.


The Urengoi-Uzhgorod pipeline has a capacity of 27.9 billion
cubic metres of gas a year, Interfax news agency reported -- a
sizeable share of the 87.8 billion cubic metres exported to
western Europe, according to 2002 figures on the website of
Russian export monopoly Gazprom.


The emergency ministry said a bypass route was used to ensure
continued supplies.
