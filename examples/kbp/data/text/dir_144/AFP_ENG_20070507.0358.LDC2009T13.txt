Veteran defender Alessandro Costacurta has been appointed
assistant to AC Milan's head coach Carlo Ancelotti, the Champions
League finalists confirmed on Monday.


"Costacurta will be the second assistant coach to Ancelotti,
alongside Mauro Tassotti," AC Milan vice president Adriano
Galliani said.


Centre-back Costacurta, 41, has played just 10 matches for AC
Milan this season, two in Serie A, three in the Champions League
and five in the Italian Cup.


Costacurta began his career with third division Monza in 1986 and
spent one year there before joining AC Milan, with whom he has
been ever since.


With AC Milan he has won seven Serie A titles and four European
Cups.


He also made 59 appearances for Italy between 1991 and 1998.
