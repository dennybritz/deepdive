Spanish challenger Desafio Espanol suffered a case of the jitters
Monday in their bid to reach the Louis Vuitton Cup semi-finals
after Sweden's Victory Challenge beat them in a do-or-die contest
off Valencia by just 7sec.


The Spanish had mined a rich seam of form with six wins in seven
outings to establish a five-point lead over their rivals going
into the final three matches.


But the Scandinavians closed the gap to ensure that Victory can
still go to the semi-finals.


The day's other flight nine action included a top of the table
clash between two of the big-hitter syndicates already qualified
for the semis along with US leaders BMW Oracle -- Emirates Team
New Zealand and Italy's Luna Rossa.
