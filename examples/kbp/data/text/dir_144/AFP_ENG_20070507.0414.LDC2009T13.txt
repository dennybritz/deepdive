Spain's Nicolas Almagro fired 13 aces in his 7-5, 6-1 first round
demolition of Britain's Tim Henman at the Rome Masters here on
Monday.


Almagro, who dropped just four points on his first serve, will
now face world number one and top seed Roger Federer.


The top eight seeds were all given first round byes.


Spanish second seed Juan Carlos Ferrero, a champion here in 2001,
needed three sets to shake off Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty while
Russian Dmitry Tursunov was equally stretched in his defeat of
Swedish veteran Jonas Bjorkman.


Spanish second seed Rafael Nadal, the world number two and
champion in Rome for the past two years, awaits the winner of the
match between American Robby Ginepri and Italy's Daniele
Bracciali.


Nadal, who beat Federer in last year's final, is aiming to become
the first player to win the Foro Italico tournament - a warm-up
for the French Open which starts on May 27 - three times in a
row.
