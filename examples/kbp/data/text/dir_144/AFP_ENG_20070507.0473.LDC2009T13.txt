A senior US commander whose unit is building a controversial wall
around a Baghdad neighbourhood was shot and wounded as he
inspected the construction, the military said Monday.


Colonel Billy Don Farris, commander of the 2nd "Falcon" Brigade
Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, was hit on Thursday last
week as he visited the barrier being built around Adhamiyah, a
statement said.


Farris "was conducting a site survey of the temporary concrete
barrier emplacements in the area when the attack occurred.  He
was hit by a single bullet," the news release said.


Farris has been treated and is in a stable condition, but has
been replaced as head of the unit by Colonel John Castles, it
said.


The 82nd Airborne is currently engaged in building a large wall
around Adhamiyah in order to protect the mainly Sunni citizens of
the district from Shiite extremists and prevent insurgent bombers
from leaving the area.


The barrier has angered some Iraqis, who warn it might exacerbate
sectarian tensions, but US commanders insist it is intended to
protect the public and has been planned with the help of the
Iraqi government.
