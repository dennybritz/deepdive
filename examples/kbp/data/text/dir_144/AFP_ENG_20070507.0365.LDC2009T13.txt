Italian cycling star Ivan Basso admitted to the anti-doping
prosecutor of the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) on Monday that
he was involved in the Operation Puerto blood doping scandal.


CONI said the 29-year-old rider came to their offices of his own
accord and offered to cooperate with their investigation and
clarify his part in the scandal.


Basso, last year's Tour of Italy winner and a pre-race favourite
for the 2007 Tour de France, is one of dozens of riders
implicated in the Operation Puerto doping affair.


Last week Basso parted company with the Discovery Channel team
after CONI had called him to a hearing to answer doping charges.


Up until now Basso had protested his innocence.


He was initially acquitted by CONI of any involvement in the
scandal due to what Italy's governing body for sport described as
insufficient evidence.


But CONI reopened their investigation after unearthing new
evidence.


Last year's Tour de France also ended in controversy when
American winner Floyd Landis tested positive for testosterone.
