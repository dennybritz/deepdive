An Israeli aircraft carried out an air strike on a car
transporting militants in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday,
wounding at least one person, witnesses told AFP.


The raid in the northern town of Jabaliya targetted militants
from the radical Islamic Jihad group, they said. The previous day
a rocket strike by the group wounded an Israeli in the southern
town of Sderot.


An Israeli army spokesman confirmed "an air raid in northern Gaza
that targetted a vehicle that was carrying arms and was on its
way to launch rockets."
