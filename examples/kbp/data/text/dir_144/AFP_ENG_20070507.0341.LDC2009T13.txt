A student sentenced to 30 days in prison for throwing a cream pie
at Norway's finance minister is taking his case to the Supreme
Court, his lawyer said on Monday.


John Waagaard, a 24-year-old student at Oslo's business school,
threw the pie at Kristin Halvorsen on her first day on the job on
October 18, 2005, in protest against her appointment.


The minister was not hurt but the incident made waves and raised
questions about security in a country where members of the royal
family and the government often visit public places with limited
or no protection.


On Monday, Oslo's appeals court upheld the 30-day sentence handed
down against Waagaard by a lower court, ruling that the act was
"a violation of the most fundamental values of a democratic
society," Norwegian news agency NTB reported.
