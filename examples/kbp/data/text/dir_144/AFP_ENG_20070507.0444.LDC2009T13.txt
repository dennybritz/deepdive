Ethiopia has rebuffed a request from Sweden that three Swedes
detained for several months on suspicion of terrorist acts be
freed, insisting that they stand trial, the government said
Monday.


A senior ministry official told the Swedish ambassador that the
appeal had "the tone of an order" and "is not acceptable."


"The suspects of terror, whatever their nationality, should be
brought to the court of justice," the ministry said.


Swedish diplomats were not immediately available for comment.


Last week, Sweden demanded the immediate release of the Swedes
held for many months by the Ethiopian authorities.


The Ethiopian government announced in early May that it was
holding 41 people of 17 nationalities arrested in Somalia on
suspicion of "terrorism".
