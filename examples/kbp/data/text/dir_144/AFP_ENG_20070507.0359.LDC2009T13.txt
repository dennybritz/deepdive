Thousands of Indians started a march Monday to mark the 150th
anniversary of a bloody revolt against British colonial rulers
that shook the empire, organisers said.


The rally, to be joined by thousands more marchers, was seen off
by Indian sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar in the northern
garrison town of Meerut, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from New
Delhi, where the uprising known as the Indian Mutiny started.


Participants will retrace the steps of Indian soldiers who
marched from Meerut to capture Delhi, where grand celebrations
are planned at the historic 17th century Red Fort built by Mughal
emperor Shah Jahan.


"There will be cultural programmes and talks on the way to spread
the message of national integration," said Sunil Malik, an
official of the government youth body that organised the march.


Led by mounted cavalry and accompanied by ambulances, the
marchers sang patriotic songs.


The revolt -- known in India as the First War of Independence --
was spurred by rumours that the British were introducing bullets
greased with cow and pig fat, which upset both Hindus and Muslims
for religious reasons.


The British crushed the revolt after four months, captured Delhi
and exiled the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar to Rangoon,
(now the Myanmar city of Yangon) where he died in captivity five
years later.


The revolt ended the British East India Company's rule in India,
making way for direct rule by the British government till 1947,
when the country gained independence.
