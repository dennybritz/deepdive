UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Monday paid tribute to UN
troubleshooter Alvaro de Soto, who is leaving the world body
after 25 years.


De Soto, a Peruvian diplomat who last served as UN coordinator
for Middle East peace, played a key role in the 1989 Central
American peace process.


"During a distinguished career both at UN headquarters and in the
field, the diplomatic talents of Alvaro de Soto were in high
demand around the world, from El Salvador to Myanmar, Cyprus to
Western Sahara, and most recently in the search for peace in the
Middle East," said a statement released by Ban's spokeswoman
Michele Montas.


De Soto's "contributions to the development of UN practices in
conflict mediation and resolution will be a lasting part of his
legacy to the United Nations," it added.
