US President George W. Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Monday discussed ways to follow up on a regional conference
aimed at helping Iraq, the White House said.


Bush, who telephoned Mubarak to wish him a happy birthday, also
noted that Vice President Dick Cheney plans to stop in Egypt
during a trip to the Middle East this week, said spokesman Tony
Snow.


The two leaders discussed last week's conference, at the Egyptian
Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, aimed at gathering regional
support for strife-torn Iraq, said the spokesman.


Bush told Mubarak "the meeting had been very well organized and
led by Egypt and provided important support" for Iraq's fragile
government," said Snow, who added that they also had a "brief
conversation" about violence in Darfur.
