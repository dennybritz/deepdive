Armenia said on Monday it had refused visas to eight Turkish
election observers from the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe who were due to monitor parliamentary
polls.


"We do not consider it proper that Turkish representatives carry
out monitoring in Armenia... due to the lack of diplomatic
relations," between the two countries, foreign ministry spokesman
Vladimir Karapetyan told AFP.


The two neighbours have no diplomatic relations and their common
border has remained closed for more than a decade.


They have fundamental differences over the mass killings of
Armenians by Ottoman Turks around the time of World War I as well
as Turkey's support for Azerbaijan in an Armenian-Azeri war in
the early 1990s.


Armenia, an ex-Soviet state in the Caucasus mountains, holds
parliamentary elections on Saturday.


A top official at the Vienna-based OSCE said Monday that he was
concerned about Armenia's decision.


"Preventing some observers from participating contradicts the
principles of transparency and objectivity which are an
indispensable aspect of democratic elections," OSCE director for
democratic institutions Christian Strohal said in a statement.
