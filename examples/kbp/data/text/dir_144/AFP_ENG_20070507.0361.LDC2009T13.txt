World number eight Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic has
pulled out of the 1.34-million-euro German Open because of a hand
injury, the organisers said on Monday.


Vaidisova, who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open
this year, will be replaced in the draw by 16-year-old Austrian
Tamira Paszek, who will face Meghann Shaughnessy of the United
States in the first round.


The tournament, considered a key claycourt warm-up for the French
Open, has attracted a top-class field including Amelie Mauresmo
who returns to action after more than two months absence
following an operation for appendicitis.


The French player, still world number three but seeded second
here behind Justine Henin, has just the Berlin and Rome
tournaments to prepare for Roland Garros.


The start of play was held up by rain, but action started later
in the day.
