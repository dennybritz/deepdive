Between 100 and 200 Iranian dissidents protested in Stockholm on
Monday against a visit to Sweden by Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki.


Protesters threw eggs at the door of the Swedish Institute of
International Affairs where Mottaki delivered a speech and
shouted slogans denouncing the Iranian regime and calling for the
release of political prisoners.


A large police force was on hand to prevent the demonstrators
from entering the building.


In his address, Mottaki stressed that Iran's nuclear programme
was "peaceful" and posed "no threat to international peace and
security."


The UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on Iran in March
and has demanded the country suspend its uranium enrichment
programme.


The United States, among others, has accused Tehran of developing
a nuclear weapons programme alongside its nuclear power
programme, which Iran has denied.


"When nothing is wrong, you cannot make any punishment," Mottaki
said.


"Despite doomed attempts to isolate the Islamic Republic of Iran,
any security arrangement in the region will not succeed without
the participation of Iran," he added.


Mottaki was scheduled to meet with Swedish Foreign Minister Carl
Bildt and Deputy Prime Minister Maud Olofsson later on Monday.
