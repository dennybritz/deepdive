Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs said Monday it had agreed to buy
Macquarie-IMM Investment Management, a South Korean asset
management firm, as it seeks to expand its regional business.


Goldman did not disclose the deal's financial terms, but said in
a statement that it hopes to close the takeover later this year.


"This acquisition is a significant milestone for GSAM in Korea, a
growing financial hub with significant market potential," said
Stephen Fitzgerald, head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management
International (GSAM).


Macquarie-IMM is 65 percent owned by Australia's Macquarie
Investment Management and 35 percent by South Korea's IMM &
Co. It describes itself as a "boutique investment manager" with
corporate, institutional and mutual fund clients.
