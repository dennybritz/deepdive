Cesc Fabregas fears Arsenal will struggle to win the Premiership
next season unless they become more ruthless.


Fabregas admits the gap between his side and champions Manchester
United is worringly big and he knows the Gunners have to find a
cure for their inability to kill off opponents if they are to
land the title for the first time since 2004.


Arsene Wenger's side are 21 points behind United and Spanish
midfielder Fabregas believes they have only themselves to blame
because they were often intent on scoring the perfect goal rather
than just focusing on winning.


"This year has been a big gap, and it was last season also," he
said.


"We have played fantastic football, but the most important things
is goals.


"I am not going to use the excuse we have been missing such a key
player like Thierry Henry, or Robin van Persie, who were both in
great form.


"That is football. You have to find other solutions. We had them
and it is not just about the strikers.


"The only midfielder who scored the goals he should have is
Gilberto, because he scored 10.


"That is good, but we should have scored more goals from midfield
as well. Hopefully we can improve on that next season."


Fabregas, whose side handed the title to United by holding
Chelsea to a 1-1 draw on Sunday, conceded that Sir Alex
Ferguson's men were worthy champions.


"Manchester United won the league because they deserve it, not
because Chelsea did not win," he said.


"I think they would have won it anyway. United have been
consistent all year and I think they deserve it."
