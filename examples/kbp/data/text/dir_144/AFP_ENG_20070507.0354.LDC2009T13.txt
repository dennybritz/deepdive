A US soldier was killed by small arms fire during a patrol in
west Baghdad, the US military said on Monday.


The soldier died on Sunday, the same day eight other US troops
were killed in incidents around the country as renewed efforts to
restore stability to the war torn country bring higher
casualties.


Since the March 2003 invasion, 3,375 US service personnel have
died in Iraq, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon
figures.
