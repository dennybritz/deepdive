The euro gained against the dollar in quiet trading on Monday
when London markets were closed for a bank holiday, traders said.


The single European currency was being traded at 1.3617 dollars,
up from 1.3592 late Friday in New York.


The dollar changed hands meanwhile for 119.91 yen, against 120.11
on Friday.


A victory in the French presidential elections by pro-market
candidate Nicolas Sarkozy helped underpin the euro, traders said.


"Local dealers see the new president as a 'reform minded'
politician that will drive French growth and prosperity," said
Matthew Forster Smith at Thomson IFR Markets.


The dollar also suffered from weak US job creation figures in
April and a rise in unemployment, now at 4.5 percent of the
workforce compared with 4.4 percent in March according to data
released on Friday.


This week, the foreign exchange market is to track interest rate
decisions in the United States, eurozone and Britain.


Analysts expect the Bank of England to raise its main lending
rate from 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent on Thursday, but do not see
the US Federal Reserve tightening the Fed funds rate Wednesday
from the current level of 5.25 percent.


The European Central Bank, which is to announce Thursday in
Dublin its latest decision, was widely expected to keep the
eurozone's main rate at 3.75 percent but most observers see an
increase to 4.0 percent in June as certain.


The euro changed hands at 1.3617 dollars, against 1.3592 dollars
late Friday, 163.36 yen (163.31), 0.6827 pounds (0.6819) and
1.6472 Swiss francs (1.6462).


The dollar stood at 119.91 yen (120.11) and 1.2097 Swiss francs
(1.2108).


The pound was being traded at 1.9944 dollars (1.9931).
