An employee of a Las Vegas hotel was killed after an explosion in
the resort's car-park early Monday, police in Nevada told AFP.


The man, whose identity was not disclosed, died after picking up
an object in the parking structure of the famous pyramid-shaped
Luxor Hotel on the busy Vegas strip. A second person was
hospitalised in the incident.


Police gave no further information about the cause of the blast
but local media reports suggested that explosives had been
stuffed into a back-pack placed on top of the dead man's car.


The parking structure was sealed off early Monday as police and
firefighters combed the building, police said.
