South Africa's deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka is to pay
an official visit to Germany this week to discuss economic co-
operation, the foreign ministry said Monday.


She was to be accompanied on the two-day visit starting Wednesday
by her deputy Sue van der Merwe, as well as the minister of
public enterprises and deputy minister of finance, said a
statement.


Germany is current chairman of the European Union and the Group
of Eight industrial powers.


In Berlin, Mlambo-Ngcuka was to meet Vice Chancellor Franz
Muntefering and pay a courtesy call on President Horst Koehler
and Chancellor Angela Merkel.


Issues topping the agenda with Muntefering included assessing
political and economic ties, South Africa's preparations for the
2010 football World Cup and greater co-operation in African
conflict resolution and peacekeeping, the text said.
