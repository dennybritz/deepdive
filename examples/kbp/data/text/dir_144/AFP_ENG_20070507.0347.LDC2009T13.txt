British journalist Anthony Mitchell, who worked for the
Associated Press news agency, was among 114 people killed in a
Kenya Airways plane crash, the foreign journalists' association
said Monday.


The Foreign Correspondents' Association of East Africa expressed
its condolences to the family of the Nairobi-based Mitchell, who
perished when the plane crashed after taking off from Cameroon's
main city of Douala.


"We wish them all a lot of courage," it said. "For those who knew
Anthony, his cynical humour and wit were unmistakable. He was
always up for a chat, a laugh and of course, a drink."


His family said in a statement: "We are all devastated, Anthony
was a fantastic father, husband and son.


"He developed a real passion for Ethiopia, where he worked for
several years, before his persistent exposures of the
government's abuse of human rights resulted in him being expelled
by the government and we moved to Kenya."


The 39-year-old father of two had been based in Nairobi since
2006.


Mitchell was returning to Kenya on Saturday after carrying out an
investigation in the Central African Republic on the criminal
trade in endangered species.
