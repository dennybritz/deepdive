A South African farmer has been arrested in Zambia for allegedly
defrauding a bank of more than two million dollars (over 1.6
million euros) in a credit facility scheme, police said on
Monday.


Leon Nortier, 32, was arrested after he obtained 2.2 million
dollars from Barclays Bank for his farm in Zambia and then
diverted the funds to another enterprise, the Drug Enforcement
Commission (DEC) said.


"He has been arrested and will appear in court soon," said Rosten
Chulu, spokesman of the DEC, which also investigates fraud and
money laundering in Zambia.


He faces charges of obtaining money by false pretences, Chulu
said.
