Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told US President George W.
Bush on Monday that he is determined to reconcile warring parties
in his strife-torn country, the White House said.


Maliki "reiterated his determination not only to continue the
process, but to work for reconciliation within Iraq," said
spokesman Tony Snow. "That was sort of the focal point of those
conversations."


The two leaders, speaking by secure videoconference, also
discussed the conference last week at the Egyptian Red Sea resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh that aimed to build regional support for Iraq,
Snow told reporters.


"Then they proceeded to talk about matters of mutual interest,
both regional relations and also outreach within Iraq," Snow said
amid deep concerns in Washington that Maliki is not doing enough
to defuse sectarian tensions.


Snow pointed to Maliki's recent visit to the western city of
Ramadi, a hotbed of Sunni insurgency, in an attempt to show his
government is starting to master the security situation.


"Issues of communications and reconciliation were at the fore,
and also outreach to groups within. You may recall the prime
minister went to Ramadi and there he met with Sunni leaders,"
said the spokesman.


The conversation took place as US Vice President Dick Cheney
prepared to head to the Middle East to build on the Egypt
conference, with scheduled stops in the United Arab Emirates,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.
