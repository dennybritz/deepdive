Growth in the eurozone money supply, as measured by the broad
indicator M3, rose more than expected in March, data showed
Wednesday, bolstering expectations for a further rise in interest
rates.


M3 growth stood at 10.9 percent on an annualised basis in March,
up from 10.0 percent in February, the Eueopean Central Bank said
in a statement.


M3 covers cash, overnight deposits, other short-term deposits,
repurchase agreements, shares and units in money market funds and
debt securities with a maturity of up to two years and is the
ECB's preferred indicator of medium-term inflationary trends in
the eurozone economy.


Analysts polled by financial news agency Thomson Financial had
predicted a 9.8-percent rise in March.


Because the monthly figures are subject to volatility, the ECB
also calculates a three-month moving average for M3 growth, which
accelerated to 10.3 percent in the period from January to March
from 9.9 percent in the period from December to February, the ECB
said.


Analysts had also expected the three-month figure to rise to 9.8
percent.


The ECB is expected to approve an increase in its benchmark
interest rate in June to 4.0 percent from 3.75 percent.


The move is likely to make the euro more attractive to investors,
thereby increasing its value and unsettling certain eurozone
governments that fear an appreciating euro will harm growth
prospects.
