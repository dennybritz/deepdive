Porsche, the German maker of luxury sports cars, said Monday it
had launched an official bid to acquire Volkswagen, Europe's
largest auto manufacturer.


Stuttgart-based Porsche announced in late March that it would
exercise an option to buy an additional 3.6-percent stake in VW.


The additional shares raised Porsche's interest in VW to 30.9
percent, effectively obliging it under German law to launch a
public takeover for all outstanding VW shares.


Under an offer to run until May 29 Porsche said it would propose
100.92 euros per ordinary share, which is well below VW's current
share price of around 112 euros, and 65.54 euros for priority
dividend shares.


Analysts have predicted that few shareholders were likely to take
up Porsche's offer, adding that Porsche in effect has no
intention of buying all of VW's share capital just yet.


They see the move as a clever way for Porsche to increase its
stature in VW without being forced to pay for any additional
shares.
