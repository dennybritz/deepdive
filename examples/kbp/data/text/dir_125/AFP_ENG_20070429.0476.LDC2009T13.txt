More than 400 children were hospitalised in China after their
classrooms were refurbished with paint containing dangerous
levels of a cancer-causing substance, state media said Monday.


The children, from Shalingzhen School in Liaoning province,
started complaining about nausea and dizziness early last week,
Xinhua news agency reported.


More than 400 were hospitalised, and nearly a week later dozens
remained under observation, according to the agency.


Officials were quick to point their fingers at the fresh paint in
the classrooms, which gave off a "sickening odour," the agency
said.


Initial tests showed several problems with the paint, including
concentrations of formaldehyde that were double the legal limit.
