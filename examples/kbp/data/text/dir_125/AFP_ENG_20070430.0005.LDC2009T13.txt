A growing fear of being fat has fuelled a doubling in the number
of Australians with eating disorders in the past decade, experts
said Monday.


Almost five percent of Australians suffer from disorders
including extreme fasting and purging, up from just two percent
10 years ago, new research shows.


"We're surprised and obviously concerned too," said study leader
Phillipa Hay, head of psychiatry at James Cook University, who
was to present the data at a national psychiatry conference.


"This is an alarming trend which shows these problems are being
felt more widely than first thought."


Women were five times more likely to have a disorder than men,
but the study found a sharp rise in men with problems, she said.


"It's a clear problem when it's spreading into groups that
weren't typically affected by weight issues," Hay said.


A large proportion of sufferers were overweight or obese, but one
in ten people in the normal weight range were "extremely
concerned" about body shape.


"People are getting heavier and there are a lot of messages and
warnings out there are reflecting that.


"But the obesity epidemic has to be managed very carefully
because there is this whole other problem it could be creating,"
she said.


An expert in eating disorders, Warren Ward of the Royal Brisbane
Hospital, said the findings came as no surprise.


"You just have to look at the TV shows on now compared to 10
years ago -- Extreme Makeover, The (Biggest) Loser," he said. "I
feel there's a mass obsession with losing weight."
