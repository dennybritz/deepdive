Co-host Thailand will head to Germany for a training camp as part
of their preparations for the Asian Cup finals in July, a report
said Monday.


Head coach Chanvit Phalajivin believes the stint will prove
useful for his team.


"It will help them focus on their professional attitude and their
skills. There won't be any distractions, unlike in Thailand," he
was quoted saying in the Bangkok Post Monday.


"They will return to Thailand strong and fit and with knowledge
of new tactics and techniques."


The Thai team will leave for Germany on June 7 or 8.


Before that, the Southeast Asian powerhouse is scheduled to play
China in a friendly on May 16 and Holland on June 6, both in
Bangkok, according to FIFA's schedule of matches.


On their return, they are due to take on Qatar on June 30 before
the Asian Cup finals get underway on July 7.


Thailand are drawn in Group A along with hot favourites
Australia, Iraq and Oman.
