Four more US soldiers have been killed in fighting in Iraq, the
US military said Monday, reporting casualties from incidents over
the weekend.


The latest casualties brought US losses for the month to 95,
making April the bloodiest month for the coalition so far this
year, and total fatalities in the campaign to 3,348.


US command in Baghdad said three soldiers were killed and one
wounded Sunday "when their vehicle was struck by an improvised
explosive device, while conducting a combat patrol in an eastern
section of the Iraqi capital."


Another soldier died on Saturday when his patrol came under fire,
again in east Baghdad, where thousands of American troops are
fighting alongside their Iraqi comrades as part of a city-wide
security operation.
