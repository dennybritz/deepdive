Coalition and Afghan troops killed 87 Taliban fighters in a
14-hour fight in a troubled district in western Afghanistan, the
US-led coalition said Monday.


The battle on Sunday was in the Shindand district of Herat
province where two days earlier security forces, retaliating
after an attack, had killed 49 Taliban, it said in a statement. A
US soldier was also killed.


On Sunday, "A total of seven enemy positions were destroyed, and
87 Taliban fighters were killed during the 14-hour engagement,"
the statement said.
