China's ZTE announced a 200-million-dollar deal with Ethiopia's
state-owned telecoms group just ahead of the release of seven
abducted Chinese workers in the African nation, a statement said
Monday.


The agreement signed Saturday with Ethiopia Telecom Corp proposes
to build up the east African nation's fledgling
telecommunications network, a statement issued by ZTE to the
Shenzhen bourse said.


The signing includes the first phase of fibre transmission
backbone, expansion of mobile phone services and the expansion of
wireless telephone operations.


State-owned ZTE will install 1.2 million mobile telephone lines
in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa and eight other towns, it said.


The announcement came before the Chinese workers kidnapped during
last week's attack on an oil plant run by China's oil giant
Sinopec in eastern Ethiopia were released late Sunday.


The clash carried out by the Ogaden National Liberation Front
left 68 Ethiopian workers and nine Chinese dead.


China has said that despite the incident it remains fully
committed to investing in Africa.
