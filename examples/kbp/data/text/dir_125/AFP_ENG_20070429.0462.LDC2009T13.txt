China's mining industry not only costs thousands of lives in
accidents every year, but also kills slowly as a result of work-
related disease, state media said Monday.


Pneumoconiosis, also known as "black lung disease," has been
diagnosed among hundreds of thousands of miners over the past
decade, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing government
statistics.


Out of 677,000 occupational disease cases reported in China since
the 1950s, more than 90 percent were potentially lethal
pneumoconiosis cases, it said, quoting the health ministry.


Last year China recorded 11,000 new occupational disease cases,
with pneumoconiosis accounting for 76 percent.


"Black lung disease" causes the deaths of about 30 percent of
those afflicted, according to some surveys.


Accidents alone make China's coal mines the most dangerous in the
world. More than 4,700 workers were killed last year, according
to official figures, but independent labour groups put the death
toll at up to 20,000 annually.
