United Microelectronics Corp (UMC), the world's second largest
contract chipmaker, said Monday its net profit for the quarter to
March fell sharply from a year earlier.


In a statement filed to the Taiwan stock exchange, UMC posted a
1.46 billion Taiwan dollar (43.84 million US) net profit, down 88
percent from 12.29 billion dollars a year ago. It did not
elaborate on the steep decline.


The company has scheduled an investor conference for Wednesday to
detail its quarterly earnings, a UMC official said.


During the same period, UMC's earnings per share fell to 0.08
dollars from 0.66 dollars a year ago.


Sales in the quarter stood at 23.03 billion dollars, compared
with 24.38 billion dollars a year earlier.
