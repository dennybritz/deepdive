Climate change experts from around the world opened a meeting
Monday in Bangkok to find ways of lowering emissions of
greenhouse gases to head off the worst effects of global warming.


At least 400 experts from about 120 countries are attending the
third session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), the UN's leading authority on global warming.


"We look forward to very fruitful days ahead of us, so at the end
of the week, we can declare we are part of the solution, not part
of the problem," said Ogunlade Davidson, co-chair of the IPCC
working group holding the meeting.


Two reports issued earlier this year said the Earth was already
warming and predicted severe consequences including drought,
flooding, violent storms and increased hunger and disease.


The week's proceedings take place behind closed doors, but there
is expected to be fierce debate between the European Union --
which has pledged to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 20
percent by 2020 -- and the United States and China, the world's
biggest carbon polluters.


The experts meeting here plan to release a report at the end of
the week, highlighting the urgent need to take action and
outlining ways of reining in greenhouse gas emissions.
