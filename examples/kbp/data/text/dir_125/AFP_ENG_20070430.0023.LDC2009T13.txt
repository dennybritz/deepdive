California Governor Alnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of
emergency Sunday for a San Francisco suburb after a tanker truck
crash and explosion collpased a highway overpass.


"I have issued an emergency declaration in order to begin
immediate repair and replacement of the interchange in
Emeryville," the governor said in a statement.


"This declaration will streamline public contracting and
environmental codes and provide emergency funding to allow repair
operations to begin immediately."


While the collapse of the ramp in the early hours of Sunday
resulted in no deaths, it is expected to cause huge traffic
problems in the congested San Francisco Bay area.
