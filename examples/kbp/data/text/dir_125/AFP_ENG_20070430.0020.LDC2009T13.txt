A top Malaysian government official on Monday dismissed
opposition claims of fraud in a weekend by-election that was won
by the ruling coalition.


Anwar Ibrahim, an outspoken former deputy prime minister trying
to make a political comeback, had alleged intimidation and fraud
in Sunday's vote, which had been seen as a litmus test ahead of
national polls next year.


But the man who currently holds the deputy post, Najib Razak,
rejected the claims and said the vote for the state legislative
seat in Ijok in central Selangor state -- won by the ruling
National Front coalition -- had been fair.


"Democracy is very much alive under Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi's leadership. This is very evident following the by-
elections in Ijok where the opposition had all the freedom to
campaign," Najib told reporters.


The weekend poll for the tiny state seat was widely touted as a
test of popularity for both the government and Anwar's opposition
Keadilan party, ahead of a general election expected before 2009.


It also marked Anwar's first major return to Malaysian politics
since he was released from jail in 2004. He had been sacked by
former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1998 and charged with
corruption and sodomy.
