Thailand's deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has kept mum
about reports that he made a surprise 108 million pound offer to
buy an English Premier League club, his lawyer said Monday.


Noppadol Pattama, Thaksin's spokesman in Bangkok, said that in
recent conversations the ousted premier had not said anything
about reports regarding the purchase of Manchester City.


"I can not deny nor confirm the report," he said.


Britain's Sun newspaper reported Saturday that Thaksin had made a
108 million pound (215 million dollar) offer to buy the club,
including 50 million pounds (99.7 million dollars) to recruit new
players.


The reports came as it appeared former City fullback Ray Ranson
was set to take over the club.


In 2004, Thaksin led a Thai consortium that tried to purchase a
30 percent stake in Liverpool, angering fans who wanted to keep
the team in British hands.


The bid eventually fell through, though Liverpool now has
American owners.


Thaksin is a billionaire who made a fortune in telecoms before
becoming prime minister in 2000.


His family made 1.9 billion dollars in cash in January 2006 on
the sale of his Shin Corp telecom firm. The deal sparked popular
unrest that eventually led to the coup that brought down his
government in September.
