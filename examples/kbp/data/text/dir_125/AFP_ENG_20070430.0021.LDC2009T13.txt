An explosion apparently triggered accidentally while militants
were transporting a bomb killed six people in the southern Iraqi
city of Basra, the US-led coalition said Monday.


Sunday's blast took place at night in a district the British
military said is "under the influence" of radical Shiite cleric
Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army.


"This explosion is likely to have been an accidental detonation
during movement and transportation of explosives in an
automobile," the statement said, adding that several people were
wounded.
