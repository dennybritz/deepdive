Northern Ireland on Monday became the third part of Britain to go
smoke-free, as a ban on lighting up in enclosed public spaces
came into force.


The new law came into effect at 6:00 am (0500 GMT). Smoking was
banned in Scottish cafes, pubs, restaurants and work places in
March last year while Wales introduced similar measures on April
2 this year.


England will be the last place in Britain to outlaw smoking, when
a ban comes in on July 1.


Smokers who flout the ban in Northern Ireland will be fined 50
pounds (73 euros, 99.6 dollars), while businesses face fines of
up to 2,500 pounds if they fail to enforce the restrictions.


Environmental health officers and other officials will be out in
force to police the ban, the government said.


The Republic of Ireland to the south of Northern Ireland
introduced a smoking ban in March 2004.
