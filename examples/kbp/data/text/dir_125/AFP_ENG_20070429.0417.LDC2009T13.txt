The first New Zealand bowler to take 100 cricket Test wickets,
Dick Motz, has died.


Motz, 67, was found dead at home on Sunday in the South Island
city of Christchurch by his former New Zealand captain Graham
Dowling, The Press newspaper reported Monday.


"He was a great fast bowler who never knew when to stop," Dowling
said.


"Although he had back trouble, he kept on going."


The beefy fast bowler and big-hitting lower order batsman played
32 Tests during the 1960s and took 19 wickets in South Africa on
his first tour in 1961-62.


He took five wickets in Test innings five times and scored three
Test half centuries.


He was New Zealand's cricketer of the year in 1961 and a Wisden's
cricketer of the year in 1966.


Motz had taken exactly 100 wickets before retiring during a tour
to England after learning he had been playing with a displaced
vertebra in his back.
