International relief agency Oxfam's international director said
in an interview published Monday that the charity's efforts to
fight poverty have been "deeply compromised" by the ongoing
scandal involving World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz.


Wolfowitz is accused of peddling personal influence for his
girlfriend by allegedly ordering a huge pay package for Shaha
Riza at the bank, and pursuing right-wing US policy goals.


"We believe that the World Bank's ability to act as a leading
development institution has already been so damaged that Mr
Wolfowitz's continued presidency of the World Bank is untenable,"
Jeremy Hobbs, Oxfam's international director, told the Financial
Times.


Hobbs's comments come before Wolfowitz heads into a crunch
meeting with a World Bank investigatory committee Monday, drawn
from the full board of 24 national representatives.


The committee is examining not just the Riza affair but his
hiring of former White House aides to influential, and highly
paid, jobs in his inner circle.


A report in The Washington Post Saturday said the panel had
already concluded that he breached ethics in engineering the pay
raise for Riza, but remained locked in debate over whether to
call explicitly for his resignation.


Propped up by declarations of "full confidence" from US President
George W. Bush, however, the neo-conservative who played a
starring role in the drive for war in Iraq shows no sign of
caving in.
