A Soviet war monument at the heart of deadly rioting in Tallinn
will be re- erected in a military cemetery Monday afternoon, the
Estonian defence ministry said.


"There is construction work going on at the cemetery to lay a
foundation for the statue," ministry spokesman Madis Mikko told
AFP.


"The statue has been cleaned up and will be placed at the
cemetery today (Monday)."


In the coming weeks, a wall will be erected around the statue at
its new site, Mikko said.


"The site will be completed by May or June and the statue will
look like it did in the city centre," he said, stressing that the
monument to Red Army soldiers who died in World War II "is
intact, in good shape".


The monument will be inaugurated in its new site on May 8, the
anniversary of the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition in World
War II, the defence ministry has said.


The 2.5-metre (eight-foot) high statue was removed early Friday
from the site in central Tallinn where it had stood for 60 years
after rioters raged through the capital the night before.


One person, a Russian citizen, was killed in the unrest, which
erupted anew Friday night and which authorities here denounced as
vandalism having nothing to do with the war monument.


More than 150 people were injured in the two nights of violence
and nearly 1,000 have been temporarily detained, many of them
under-age.


Excavations are under way at the old monument site to determine
if any fallen Soviet soldiers lie buried there.
