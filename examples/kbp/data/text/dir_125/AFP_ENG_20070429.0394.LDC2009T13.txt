Veteran pitcher Jamie Moyer pitched six no-hit innings as the
Philadelphia Phillies beat the Florida Marlins 6-1 Sunday in the
rubber game of a three-game set.


Chase Utley had an RBI single in the first inning to give
Philadelphia a 1-0 lead. Moyer made the slim lead stand as he
kept the Marlins off balance all game.


The 44-year-old Moyer, who improved to 3-1, is 5-0 in five career
starts against the Marlins.


He took a no-hitter into the seventh and allowed two hits and two
walks in 7 1/3 innings.


Moyer struck out five and also had a pair of hits for his third
career two-hit game and first since August 15, 1987 against the
New York Mets.


Miguel Cabrera, who had a career-best five hits in Florida's 11-5
win Saturday, broke up Moyer's bid for a no-hitter with a double
to left field with two outs in the seventh.


By then, Moyer had a 3-0 lead to work with, thanks to a two-run
single by Jayson Werth in the sixth.


Moyer left with runners on first and second and one out in the
eighth.  Brett Myers came on and closed the door on the threat,
striking out pinch hitters Miguel Olivo Mike Jacobs to end the
inning.


Pinch hitter Greg Dobbs made it 6-0 with a bases-clearing double
in the eighth for Philadelphia, which has won seven of nine.


Marlins starter Wes Obermueller allowed three runs and five hits
in 5 2/3 innings.


Florida scratched out a run in the ninth off of reliever Antonio
Alfonseca to avoid the shutout.
