British energy giant BP was tipped to win a majority stake in
Pakistan State Oil (PSO) in a deal worth 600 million dollars (441
million euros), The Times reported on Monday without citing
sources.


Other interested parties include Malaysian oil and gas giant
Petronas and oil marketing company Vitol, the daily newspaper
added.


BP was bidding for the stake with MerchantBridge, a new London-
based investment bank.


Pakistan's government owns 54 percent of PSO and has hired JP
Morgan, the US investment bank, to sell a 51 percent stake in the
company.


PSO owns two refineries and 3,700 petrol stations in Pakistan,
and posted sales of 353 billion Pakistani rupees (4.3 billion
euros, 5.8 billion dollars) in the group's financial year ending
in June 2006.
