Australian share prices closed 0.23 percent higher Monday as
investors were buoyed by another record finish on Wall Street
Friday despite weaker than expected first quarter US growth
figures, dealers said.


The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 ended up 14.4 points at 6,166 while
the broader All Ordinaries index gained 17.3 points to 6,158.3.
