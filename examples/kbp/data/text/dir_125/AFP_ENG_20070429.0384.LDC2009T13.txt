Egyptian police Sunday arrested 14 members of the banned Muslim
Brotherhood movement, including two parliamentary deputies,
security officials told AFP.


The group were apprehended in the house of one of the members, in
the Menufiya region north of Cairo. Police found documents at the
address that allegedly sought to justify the existence of the
Muslim Brotherhood -- a crime in Egypt.


Officials said the two MPs arrested were Sabri Amer and Ragab Abu
Zeid.


The Muslim Brotherhood called the arrests evidence of government
"repression" against its organisation, according to a website run
by the group.


A fifth of Egypt's parliament is effectively controlled by the
Brotherhood, which is supported by MPs officially declaring
themselves "independents".


But the country's security service has been conducting a
crackdown in recent months, stepping up arrests of suspected
members. On April 14 and 15, 32 members were arrested in a Cairo
university and a nearby suburb in the capital.
