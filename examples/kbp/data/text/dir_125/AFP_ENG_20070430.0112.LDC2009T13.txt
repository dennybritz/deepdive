A Mauritanian convicted of rape and a Saudi convicted of murder
were beheaded by the sword in Saudi Arabia on Monday, the
interior ministry said.


Mohammed al-Mami Baba Ould Baba, who was found guilty of breaking
into three houses and raping an unspecified number of women, was
executed in the Muslim holy city of Medina, said a ministry
statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.


It said that he also stole jewellery and money from his victims
after threatening to kill them or their children.


Hamad bin Fahd al-Rashidi was executed in the capital after being
convicted of shooting dead stateless resident Saleh bin Aliwi
Shahit after an argument, a second statement said.


The latest beheadings brings to 46 (eds: correct) the number of
executions announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia,
or Islamic law. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug
trafficking can all carry the death penalty.
