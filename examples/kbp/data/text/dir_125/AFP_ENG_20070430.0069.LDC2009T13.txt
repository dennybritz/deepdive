England and Australia remain contingency options to host the 2010
World Cup in case South Africa fails to meet organisational
deadlines, FIFA president Sepp Blatter said.


South Africa will become the first African nation to host
football's four-year shopiece event in three years' time, but
reports of delays in stadium construction work have threatened
hopes of the tournament being staged there.


FIFA remain confident that all necessary facilities will be ready
in time but Blatter clearly feels FIFA need to keep options open
in case there are any unforeseen problems.


Asked if England or Australia were fall-back options should the
South African organisation falter, Blatter told the BBC's Inside
Sport programme:


"Yes, but there are other countries that are ready to organise
tomorrow morning or in two days, or two months, a World Cup. The
United States of America, and Mexico, they can do it, Japan, they
can do it. They have enough stadia.


"You say England can do it, and I am sure. Spain, they can do it.
There are a lot of countries, but they don't need to be ready."
