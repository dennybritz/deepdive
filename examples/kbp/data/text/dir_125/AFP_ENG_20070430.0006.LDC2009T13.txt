Aides to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki played a leading
role in the arrest and removal of senior Iraqi army and police
officers, who tried to rein in Shiite militias, The Washington
Post reported Monday.


Citing US military officials and documents obtained in Baghdad,
the newspaper said that since March 1, at least 16 army and
national police commanders have been fired, detained or pressured
to resign.


At least nine of them were Sunnis.


Although some of the officers appear to have been fired for
legitimate reasons, several were considered to be among the
better Iraqi officers in the field, The Post said.


The dismissals have angered US and Iraqi leaders who say the
Shiite-led government is sabotaging the military to achieve
sectarian goals, according to the report.


"Their only crimes or offenses were they were successful" against
the Mahdi Army, the paper quoted Brigadier General Dana Pittard,
commanding officer of the Iraq Assistance Group, as saying. "I'm
tired of seeing good Iraqi officers having to look over their
shoulders when they're trying to do the right thing."


During earlier security crackdowns in Baghdad, Maliki was
criticized for failing to target Shiite militias, in particular
the Mahdi Army, which is led by hard- line cleric Moqtada al-
Sadr, the report said.


Iraqi government officials denied that security force commanders
have faced political pressure and said that Maliki is committed
to targeting all criminals equally, The Post reported.
