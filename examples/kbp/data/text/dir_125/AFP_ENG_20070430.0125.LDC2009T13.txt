Police in Indian-administered Kashmir said Monday they have
arrested four hardline separatists for organising a large anti-
government rally.


"We have booked the four under Public Safety Act (PSA)," a police
officer told AFP, referring to possible charges that can carry a
punishment of at least six months in jail.


The four were arrested for holding an unauthorised rally on April
22 to welcome back Syed Ali Geelani, leader of the hardline
faction of the region's main separatist alliance, who had
undergone cancer treatment in Mumbai.


Police complained that "anti-national" slogans -- a euphemism
used for anti- India and pro-separatist slogans -- had been
chanted at the rally.


The arrests, which were made last week, came as prominent
separatists boycotted talks in New Delhi aimed at easing tensions
in the revolt-hit state, which is divided between India and
Pakistan.


Another separatist leader, Farooq Tawheedi, said other activists
have been arrested in recent days.


"They want to act tough against us after our successful rally,
but these tactics won't work," he told reporters. "We represent
the voice and sentiments of the people."
