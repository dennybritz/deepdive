Hong Kong share prices closed 1.01 percent lower Monday on
worries China may announce further credit-tightening measures,
including an interest rate hike, after raising the reserves
requirement ratio of commercial banks, dealers said.


Investors also locked in profits ahead of the Labor Day holiday,
which will see the local market shut Tuesday and the mainland
bourses closed for a week.


The People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank,
announced on Sunday that it will raise the reserve requirement
for commercial banks by another 50 basis points, effective May
15.


The latest hike, which takes the required reserves ratio of most
Chinese banks to 11 percent, is the seventh such move by the PBoC
since the middle of last year and the second in a little over a
month.


The Hang Seng index closed down 207.52 points at 20,318.98, off a
low of 20,130.11 and a high of 20,525.96. Turnover was 49.84
billion Hong Kong dollars (6.4 billion US).
