Taiwan carrier EVA Airways Corp Monday posted a loss for the
quarter to March on fierce cargo competition and a sharp decline
in non-core business earnings.


In the three month period, EVA Air posted 331.30 million Taiwan
dollars (9.95 million US) net loss, compared with a 225.92
million dollar net profit a year earlier.


An EVA Air spokesman said the air cargo business was faced with
escalating competition as EVA Air's rivals were aggressive in
expanding capacity.


"But, EVA Air cut its cargo capacity by six percent by disposing
of and leasing out three aircraft. We were under great pressure,"
the spokesman said.


He said earnings from non-core businesses in the quarter fell to
291 million dollars from 776 million dollars a year earlier.


"We lacked adequate non-core business earnings to improve our
overall profitability," he added.


However, the spokesman said EVA Air enjoyed stable earnings from
passenger flight services with a load factor at about 80 percent.


In the quarter, EVA posted 22.49 billion dollars in sales,
compared with 22.65 billion dollars a year earlier.
