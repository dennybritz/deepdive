Murdered Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was poisoned before
being strangled, rendering him powerless to fight back against
his killer, the BBC will say in a programme on Monday.


According to the broadcaster's flagship investigative show
Panorama, preliminary drug tests revealed a substance in
Woolmer's body that would have weakened him.


Woolmer, 58, was found dead in his Kingston hotel room on March
18, the day after cricketing powers Pakistan crashed out of the
World Cup in an upset loss to minnows Ireland.


The officer leading the investigation, Jamaican Deputy Police
Commissioner Mark Shields, told programme makers that it would
have been difficult to strangle a man the size of Woomer, who is
six-feet two-inches tall.


"It's difficult and it's rare," Shields said.


"A lot of force would be needed to do that."


"Bob Woolmer was a large man and that's why one could argue that
it was an extremely strong person, or may be more than one
person, but equally the lack of external injuries suggests that
there might be some other factors and that's what we're looking
into at the moment."


Though the final results of toxicology tests are expected to be
handed to Shields and his colleagues next week, they are likely
to confirm the preliminary findings, according to Panorama.


Woolmer's death led to a fevered round of speculation as to the
motive for the murder. The most common theory is that his killing
was linked to match-fixing and illegal betting in cricket.


Some 30 police investigators are working full-time on the Woolmer
case and more than 100 witness statements have been taken.


Scotland Yard, Pakistan detectives as well as Interpol have been
drafted in to help the investigation.
