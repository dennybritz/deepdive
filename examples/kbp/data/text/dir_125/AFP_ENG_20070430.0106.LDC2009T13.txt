Economic optimism edged down in Europe in April from a six-year
high last month, as the euro flirted with records against other
currencies, a key European Commission survey showed on Monday.


The Commission's eurozone economic sentiment indicator eased to
111.0 points in April in the 13 countries using the euro from
111.1 points in March, confounding the forecast of private
economists for a new rise to 111.6.


The outlook also dimmed slightly in the broader 27-member
European Union, where the indicator was down 0.2 of a point to
113.6 points, the EU's executive arm said.


A separate eurozone business climate indicator rose to an all-
time record of 1.61 in April from 1.54 in March, the Commission
said.


"This augurs well for continued strong industrial production
growth in the first two quarters of 2007," it said.
