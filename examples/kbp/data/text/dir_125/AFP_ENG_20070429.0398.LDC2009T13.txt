Local favorite Scott Verplank won the 6.3 million-dollar Byron
Nelson Championship on Sunday, posting a one-shot victory over
third-round leader Luke Donald.


Verplank took control with five birdies in eight holes, then held
on down the stretch to prevail in his 21st appearance in the
event, seven months after the death of former host Byron Nelson.


Verplank carded a 4-under 66 for a 13-under total of 267 and his
fifth PGA Tour victory.


England's Donald carded a 68 for 268.


Donald had a chance to force a playoff, but his 10-foot birdie
chance at the 18th hole missed left.


"I thought I hit a good putt," said Donald, who realized what the
victory meant to Verplank. "You could see when he won it was a
special moment for him."


Phil Mickelson flirted with contention during the final round,
finishing tied for third with Jerry Kelly, South African Rory
Sabbatini and England's Ian Poulter, three shots behind.
