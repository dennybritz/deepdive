South Korean steel giant POSCO swapped stakes Monday with Hyundai
Heavy industries, the world's largest shipyard, to strengthen its
defences against any hostile takeover.


The world's third largest steelmaker has engaged in cross-
shareholding deals with friendly firms since it emerged as a
possible target for a takeover by Arcelor Mittal, the world's
biggest steelmaker.


On Monday Hyundai Heavy's subsidiary Hyundai Mipo bought a 1.0
percent stake in POSCO worth 343 billion won (369 million
dollars). In return, POSCO bought a 1.9 percent stake in Hyundai
Heavy.


"The deal, which was completed today, will help POSCO step up its
defences to thwart any hostile takeover attempt," a POSCO
official told AFP on condition of anonymity.


POSCO, 59 percent owned by foreign investors, counts Japan's
Nippon Steel, the world's second largest steelmaker, as its
biggest shareholder and ally.


Arcelor Mittal and POSCO are jostling to meet rapidly growing
Asian demand led by China and India. Mittal acquired rival
Arcelor of Luxembourg last year to create the world's largest
steel group.
