England's Dan Wheldon cruised to victory in the IndyCar Series
Kansas Lottery Indy 300 Sunday and immediately set his sights on
next month's Indy 500.


Wheldon led 177 of the 200 laps and finished with a comfortable
victory over Scotland's Dario Franchitti.


"We have a big race coming up next month at Indianapolis and
that's the one I really want to win," said Wheldon, who won the
2005 Indy 500. "I want to taste the milk again."


Wheldon became the first two-time winner of 2007 after his
victory in the season-opening race in Homestead, Florida, last
month.


"I told Dan today we want to go into Indianpaolis solidly in
points and the other teams know we can be competitive there,"
team owner Chip Ganassi said. "This is definitely a momentum
booster for us."


Brazil's Helio Castroneves was third, followed by New Zealand's
Scott Dixon and South African Tomas Scheckter.


The race ended under caution after Jeff Simmons crashed with
three laps to go.


Milka Duno of Venezuela made her first career IndyCar start and
finished 14th.
