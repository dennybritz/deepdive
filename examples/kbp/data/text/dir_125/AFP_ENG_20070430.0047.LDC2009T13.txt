The Asian Tour on Monday added extra golf tournaments in China
and Indonesia to its schedule but dropped two from Malaysia.


The Midea China Classic will played at the Royal Orchid Golf Club
in Guangzhou from September 13-16 while the President's Challenge
will debut at the Cengkareng Golf Club in Jakarta from October
25-28.


The China tournament -- the sixth Asian Tour event in the booming
nation -- will offer 400,000 US dollars in prize money while
500,000 dollars will be at stake in Indonesia.


But two events were dropped in Malaysia. The Asian Tour also said
the title sponsor of the Crowne Plaza Open, due to be played in
late June, had requested a postponement until next year.


Similarly, the Pulai Springs Malaysian Masters in Johor Bahru was
postponed as its golf course is being renovated following massive
floods in southern Malaysia late last year.


It means several events will see changes to their dates.


The Johor Classic will now be played from August 16-19, the
Indonesia International Championship from August 23-26, and the
Brunei Open from August 30 to September 2.


The dates for the inaugural Cambodian Open and season-ending
Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok have been brought forward by a
week respectively to November 29-December 2 and December 6-9.
