At least two people were killed Sunday when a gunman opened fire
at a shopping mall center in Kansas City, Missouri, US media
reported.


The gunfire sent shoppers scrambling for cover at the Ward
Parkway Center, a shopping plaza about nine miles (14 kilometers)
south of downtown Kansas City in the midwestern state of
Missouri, local reports said.


Kansas City Fire Department Battalion Chief Joe Vitale told CNN
that the dead included the original shooter. Two or three other
people were wounded in the shooting, he said.


One shopper, Cathy Crist, told the Kansas City Star newspaper she
had been eating lunch inside the mall when she heard shots that
seemed to come from the parking lot outside.


She heard women scream, "He's killing us," before she dove under
a table for cover, the report said.


The shootings came less than two weeks after a mentally ill South
Korean college student went on a shooting rampage at Virginia
Tech university, killing 32 people before turning his weapon on
himself.
