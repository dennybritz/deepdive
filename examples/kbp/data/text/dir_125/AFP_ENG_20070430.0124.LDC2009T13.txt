Four more US army soldiers and one marine have been killed in
fighting in Iraq, the US military said on Monday, reporting
casualties from incidents over the weekend.


The latest deaths brought US losses for the month to 96, making
April the bloodiest month for the coalition so far this year, and
total fatalities in the campaign to 3,349.


US command in Baghdad said three soldiers were killed and one
wounded on Sunday "when their vehicle was struck by an improvised
explosive device, while conducting a combat patrol in an eastern
section of the Iraqi capital."


Another soldier died on Saturday when his patrol came under fire,
again in east Baghdad, where thousands of American troops are
fighting alongside their Iraqi comrades as part of a city-wide
security operation.


Meanwhile, on Sunday a marine was killed "while conducting combat
operations" in western Iraq's Anbar Province, a hotbed of support
for Al-Qaeda and the Sunni insurgency against the Iraqi
government and its US allies.
