At least three people were killed Sunday when a gunman opened
fire at a shopping mall in Kansas City, Missouri, police said.


The gunfire sent shoppers scrambling for cover at the Ward
Parkway Center, a popular shopping plaza in the midwestern state
of Missouri, witnesses said.


Police spokesman Tony Sanders said the gunman shot and killed two
people in the parking lot of the mall, and said the shooter was
gunned down by police who responded to the scene.


At least two people were wounded as well as one police officer,
Sanders told CNN.


Police were investigating whether the incident was related to an
earlier shootout with police at a nearby gas station, Sanders
said.


The shopping center had been entirely locked down and
investigators were treating it as a "giant crime scene," he said.


Television footage showed armed police running toward the mall
and one man who was apparently wounded in the shooting, sitting
on a curb with blood streaming down his face as he covered one
eye with a piece of cloth.


One shopper, Cathy Crist, told the Kansas City Star newspaper she
had been eating lunch inside the mall when she heard shots that
seemed to come from the parking lot outside.


She heard women scream, "He's killing us," before she dove under
a table for cover, the report said.


The shootings came less than two weeks after a mentally ill South
Korean college student went on a shooting rampage at Virginia
Tech university, killing 32 people before turning his weapon on
himself.
