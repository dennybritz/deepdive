Waitakere United will play-off against the winners of Japan's
J-League for a place in the lucrative Club World Cup after
winning the Oceania Nations Cup final on Sunday.


The New Zealand outfit beat Fijian champions Ba FC 1-0 with Allan
Pearce scoring the winner in the 55th minute to set up the clash
later this year. Ba won the first leg in Fiji 2-1, with
Waitakere's away goal proving crucial.


The rules of the end-of-year Club World Cup have been changed to
include a play- off between the Oceania champions and the host
nation, this year Japan, to decide which lines up in the six-team
continental competition.


Previously, the Club World Cup featured the champions of Europe,
South America, Central and North America, Africa, Asia and
Oceania, but in a bid to boost interest in the host country the
format was amended in March.


Japan will host the tournament for the third consecutive year in
December.


The Club World Cup, won by Brazil's Internacional last year, has
replaced the traditional fixture between the European and South
American title-holders played since 1960.
