The woman who became South Korea's first female prime minister
announced Monday she plans to run for the presidency in December.


When Han Myeong-Sook resigned as premier in early March, there
was speculation she was readying a presidential bid. But her
comments on a radio programme Monday were the first confirmation.


"I am intending to raise my flag in May," Han said.


The two-time lawmaker with the pro-government Uri Party took
office as South Korea's first female prime minister in April
2006.


Two women are now striving to become the nation's first female
president. Park Geun-Hye, daughter of former president Park
Chung-Hee, will compete this summer with Lee Myung-Bak, a former
Seoul mayor, for the nomination of the conservative opposition
Grand National Party (GNP).


The GNP has consistently led opinion polls with eight months to
go to the vote. But it suffered a setback in parliamentary by-
elections last week, winning only one of three contests.


Uri, formerly President Roh Moo-Hyun's party, lost its status as
the majority party in parliament to the GNP when 32 lawmakers
defected this year.


It plans to merge with small parties to form a new force to
challenge its conservative rival in December.


Uri and its potential allies have yet to propose any presidential
candidates and it was unclear for whom Han, a former pro-
democracy activist, would stand.
