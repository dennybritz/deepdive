Shares in Spanish telecommunications group Telefonica and Italy's
Telecom Italia gained ground in early trading Monday following a
weekend announcement that Telefonica was to take a 10 percent
stake in the Italian company.


Telefonica was up 0.42 percent at 16.62 euros on the Ibex-35
index here, which was 0.05 percent weaker overall.


In Milan, Telecom Italia opened with a gain of 2.0 percent to
2.315 euros but later lost some ground and was up 0.31 percent at
2.275 euros by mid-morning.


Telefonica on Saturday reached an agreement with Telecom Italia
under which it would acquire a 10 percent indirect stake in the
Italian operator for 2.314 billion euros (3.1 billion dollars).


Spanish newspaper Cinca Diaz said Monday that the two companies
would remain independent, with Telefonica hoping to realize cost
savings through the arrangement.
