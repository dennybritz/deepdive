A majority of South Koreans support a free trade agreement with
the United States, according to a poll published Monday, raising
hopes it will eventually be approved by parliament.


Some 61 percent believe the deal reached early April will benefit
their country compared to 31 percent who oppose it, according to
a poll by Gallup Korea.


The survey of some 1,500 people, commissioned by a pro-free trade
organisation, has an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 percentage
points.


The two sides sealed the pact on April 2 after 10 months of tough
talks. Some studies forecast it could boost annual trade worth 78
billion dollars by as much as 20 percent.


The deal must be ratified by the US Congress and the South Korean
legislature.


State-run think tanks said separately the pact is expected to
raise South Korea's annual economic growth by around 0.6 percent
a year over the next decade and create hundreds of thousands of
new jobs.


The forecast by the 11 bodies, quoted by Yonhap news agency, also
predicted more foreign investment and lower prices for ordinary
people.
