St. Louis pitcher Josh Hancock, a member of the Cardinals' 2006
World Series- winning team, died early Sunday in a road accident
at the age of 29, the team said.


According to a statement from the team, Hancock was killed
shortly after midnight when the car he was driving struck the
back end of a tow-truck that was stopped in the far left lane
with its hazards lights on assisting another vehicle.


According to police, Hancock did not attempt to avoid the
collision until the last second and he appeared to be killed
immediately.


The police also said that speed was not a factor and no alcohol
was found in the vehicle.


Due to the tragedy, the finale of a weekend series between the
Cardinals and Chicago Cubs set for Sunday night was postponed.


Teams around the major leagues did their best to remember
Hancock. Numerous teams held a moment of silence for the pitcher,
including the Cleveland Indians prior to their game against the
Baltimore Orioles.


Hancock had appeared in eight games this season, going 0-1 with a
3.55 ERA in 12 2/3 innings.


A righthander, Hancock pitched for six seasons, going 9-7 with a
4.20 ERA and one save in 102 games with the Cardinals,
Cincinnati, Philadelphia and Boston.


Hancock is the second Cardinals pitcher in the last five years to
die during the season. Three-time All-Star Darryl Kile died on
June 22, 2002, of heart disease.


Kile was found dead in his Chicago hotel room when the Cardinals
were there for a series against the Cubs.
