Italian energy group Eni said Monday it had acquired the oil
production operations in the Gulf of Mexico of the US firm
Dominion Resources for 4.757 billion euros (6.5 billion dollars).


The assets acquired by Eni include production, development and
exploration structures.


Eni said that with the acquisition its oilfield output should
come to an average of 75,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day
between 2007 and 2010.


The company earlier this year bought oil production assets in the
Congo, Angola, Russia and the US state of Alaska.
