British Prime Minister Tony Blair's decade in power has not
improved life, according to two-thirds of respondents in a poll
published Monday.


The YouGov survey published in The Daily Telegraph also showed
that only a fifth of those questioned said they would be sad to
see Blair, whose governing Labour Party came to power in 1997,
step down.


Blair publicly pledged last September that he would resign within
a year, and Labour have struggled in recent opinion polls against
the main opposition Conservative Party.


Labour is expected to fare poorly in elections on Thursday for
some local councils across Britain, and regional assemblies in
Scotland and Wales. Blair is widely expected to announce his
resignation in the aftermath of the vote.


According to the poll, 26 percent of respondents said things have
got better while Blair has been prime minister, while 48 percent
said things had got worse, and 19 percent said they had stayed
the same.


Asked by pollsters how they would feel when Blair finally steps
down, just a fifth said they will be sad, while 39 percent said
they would be happy, and 34 percent said they will not care
either way.


Rating his performance, 45 percent said he was either poor or
very poor, while 24 percent said he was either good or excellent.
Some 26 percent said he had been a fair leader.


YouGov questioned 2,019 adults over the Internet between April 23
and 25 for the poll.
