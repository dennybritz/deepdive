Inflation in the 13 countries sharing the euro single currency
will ease slightly in April compared to the previous month,
according to an official EU estimate released Monday.


Twelve-month inflation is expected to come to 1.8 percent in
April, in line with the forecast of private economists, the
European Union's Eurostat data agency said in a "flash estimate."
It stood at 1.9 percent in March.


The figure remains in line with the European Central Bank's
preference for an annual inflation rate of less than but close to
2.0 percent to maintain price stability.


With economic activity in the eurozone brisk, the ECB is keen to
keep inflation pressures firmly under control and sent a clear
signal earlier this month that it could raise its key interest
rates in June.


Eurostat is due to update its April inflation estimate with more
complete data on May 16.
