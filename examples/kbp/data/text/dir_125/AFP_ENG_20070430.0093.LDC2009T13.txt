A Mauritanian national was beheaded by the sword in the Muslim
holy city of Medina on Monday after being convicted of rape and
robbery, the interior ministry said.


Mohammed al-Mami Baba Ould Baba was convicted of breaking into
three houses and raping an unspecified number of women, said a
ministry statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.


It said that he also stole jewellery and money from his victims
after threatening to kill them or their children.


The latest beheading brings to 42 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia,
or Islamic law. Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug
trafficking can all carry the death penalty.
