Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ratings have rebounded from
their earlier lows after high-profile summits with China's
premier and US President George W. Bush, according to two surveys
Monday.


The latest monthly telephone polls for the Mainichi Shimbun and
the Nikkei business daily both showed his approval rating in
positive territory, meaning more people think he is doing a good
job than those who do not.


The Mainichi Shimbun attributed the rise partly to his summits
with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao here on April 11 and Bush in
Washington last Friday.


Abe is currently on a tour of the Middle East and Gulf.


"His face has become more visible due to top-level diplomacy and
his active inspection tours to the countryside," the Mainichi
said.


In the Mainichi Shimbun, Abe's approval rating for April rose
eight points to 43 percent while disapproval was down nine to 33
percent.


It was the first rise in his ratings since he took office seven
months ago, and the first time since January that approval had
exceeded disapproval.


The Mainichi poll was based on responses from 1,085 people.


In the poll for the leading business daily Nikkei, the support
rate jumped 10 points to 53 percent while the disapproval rate
fell eight to 37 percent.


It was the first time in two months that the Nikkei poll had more
people in favour than against Abe. The Nikkei poll had 865
responses.


Apart from diplomacy, the Nikkei partly attributed the
improvement in Abe's popularity to fewer gaffes.
