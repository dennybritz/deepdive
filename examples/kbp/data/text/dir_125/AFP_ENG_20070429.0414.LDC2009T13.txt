Eight British Royal Navy sailors held by Iran for about two weeks
a month ago have re-joined their colleagues aboard the HMS
Cornwall, The Sun tabloid reported on Monday.


A spokeswoman for the defence ministry declined to confirm any
specific names, or the number of people who had resumed work
aboard the frigate, but told AFP that "some of them are returning
to their ship."


"They went back to work last Monday, and they've been having
debriefing since then," the spokeswoman said.


Along with seven marines, the eight sailors were seized at
gunpoint by Iranian Revolutionary Guards after boarding a
merchant vessel on March 23. They were held for 13 days, and
returned home on April 5.


Britain insists they were well within Iraqi waters when captured,
which Iran disputes.


"These are eight brave people whose only wish is to once again do
their duty," an unidentified senior Royal Navy source told The
Sun.


"The nation should be proud of them."


The HMS Cornwall is currently in the Gulf, the defence ministry
spokeswoman confirmed to AFP.
