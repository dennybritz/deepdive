At least 11 people were killed in attacks across Iraq on Monday,
including two car bombs that targeted Iraqi police, security
officials said.


In Baghdad, a suicide bomber blew up a vehicle outside a police
headquarters in a western district, killing five people and
wounding 12, a security official said.


The Iraqi police have come under heavy fire in recent months as
they have struggled to clamp down on the capital's daily mayhem
as part of a 10-week-old security plan.


Elsewhere in the capital, a former brigadier general in Saddam
Hussein's army was shot dead in the volatile Dura neighborhood,
and a civilian was killed by a roadside bomb in a neighbouring
district.


Another two civilians were wounded by the blast.


In the northern city of Mosul, an overnight shootout at a police
station left four gunmen dead.


"A number of gunmen attacked Al-Waqqas police station in western
Mosul prompting the police to counterattack and kill four
gunmen," said police Colonel Mohammed al-Waggaa.


A remotely detonated car bomb exploded near some reinforcements
who were racing to the scene, killing one policeman and wounding
two.
