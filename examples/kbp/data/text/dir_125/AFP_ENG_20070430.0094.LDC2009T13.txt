Two unknown assailants attacked an Athens police station in the
early hours of Monday, firing some 30 shots and setting off a
grenade near the building, police said.


No one was injured in the 1:20 am (2220 GMT Sunday) attack at the
Nea Ionia police station in the north of the capital, police said
in a statement.


The two attackers, riding a large motorcycle, fired around 30
nine-millimetre bullets at the building before throwing a grenade
into the street as they sped off. Several cars were damaged.


The bullets were of the same make as ammunition used in two armed
robberies in Athens, one earlier this month and one in December
2004, police said.
