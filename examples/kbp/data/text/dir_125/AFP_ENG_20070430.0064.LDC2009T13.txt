Accountancy firms Grant Thornton and RSM Robson Rhodes have
agreed to merge, creating the fifth biggest group in Britain,
according to an official statement received on Monday.


"The partners of Grant Thornton UK and RSM Robson Rhodes have
announced their agreement to merge the two firms to create one of
the strongest accounting and business advisory firms in the UK,"
the groups said in a joint statement.


The combined company will use the name Grant Thornton and the
merger is expected to complete on July 1, 2007.


The newly-formed firm will be the fifth biggest player in Britain
after heavyweights PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, KPMG and
Ernst and Young -- which are collectively known as the "Big
Four".


The new Grant Thornton will have over 300 partners and 4,400
staff, and fee income of around 375 million pounds (550 million
euros, 748 million dollars).


In Britain, the accountancy sector is dominated by the "Big Four"
who audit 98 percent of the 350 biggest companies listed on the
London stock market.
