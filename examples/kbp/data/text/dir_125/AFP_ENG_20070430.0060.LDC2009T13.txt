German retail sales fell in March, surprising analysts who had
foreseen continued expansion following a small gain in February.


The federal statistics office said retail sales were down 0.7
percent in March from the previous month. Analysts surveyed by
the news agency Thomson Financial had predicted an increase of
0.9 percent last month.


Compared with March 2006 sales were up 0.5 percent.
