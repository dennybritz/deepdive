Hong Kong share prices opened flat Monday after China's central
bank announced a further rise in the reserve requirement ratio of
commercial banks in an effort to curb excessive lending, dealers
said.


There are expectations that China could implement more measures,
including an interest rate rise, in the coming days as it tries
to cool down its economy after higher-than-expected growth in the
first quarter.


The People's Bank of China announced that it will raise its
reserve requirement for commercial banks by 50 basis points,
effective May 15.


The latest rise is the seventh since the middle of last year and
the second in a little over a month.


The benchmark Hang Seng index opened down 0.54 points at
20,525.96.
