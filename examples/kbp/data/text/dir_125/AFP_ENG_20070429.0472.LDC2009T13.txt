Vietnam has freed or cut the terms of at least 441 prisoners to
mark the April 30 Reunification Day but former British pop star
and sex offender Gary Glitter was not among them, state media
said Monday.


The capital Hanoi freed 36 inmates and reduced the terms of 163
others to mark the end of the war in 1975 and May Day on Tuesday,
while central Khanh Hoa province reduced the sentences of 242
people, said the Vietnam News Agency.


Glitter, 62, a former "glam rocker" who had a series of hits in
the 1970s, has been in prison in Vietnam since November 2005. He
was found guilty in March last year of sexually molesting two
girls when they were aged 11 and 12.


A Vietnamese court in February reduced his term by three months,
moving forward Glitter's release date to August 2008.
