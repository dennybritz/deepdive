About 2,000 NATO-led and Afghan troops kicked off a new operation
Monday to flush Taliban fighters out of a valley in Afghanistan's
premier opium producing province, the British military said.


Operation Silicon is focused on the Sangin Valley of the southern
province of Helmand.


"It's an operation to to clear the Taliban from the lower Sangin
Valley," a spokesman for the British deployment to Afghanistan
told AFP.


Most of Britain's more than 5,000 troops with NATO's
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) are based in
Helmand.


The new drive falls under Operation Achilles, ISAF's biggest
campaign against the Taliban, foreign fighters and drugs barons
that kicked off in Helmand nearly two months ago.


Achilles involves about 5,500 soldiers -- most of them from
Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and the United States -- as well
as 1,000 Afghans.


Sangin, 70 kilometres (40 miles) northeast of the provincial
capital Lashkar Gah, has seen regular clashes with Taliban
fighters who are said to have joined forces with drugs barons in
Helmand.


The province produces about 40 percent of the opium from
Afghanistan, which supplies more than 90 percent of the world's
illegal opium.


It is also said to be home to some of the Taliban's leaders,
including Mullah Dadullah -- the extremist group's military
operations commander for the south.
