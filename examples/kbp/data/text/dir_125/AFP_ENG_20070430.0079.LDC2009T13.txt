Global banking giant HSBC on Monday said it would sell its London
headquarters for 1.09 billion pounds to Spanish property group
Metrovacesa in the biggest property deal in British history.


The sale, which is worth 1.60 billion euros or 2.17 billion
dollars, will allow HSBC to remain in the building. But
Metrovacesa will own a 998-year lease on the Canary Wharf office
block in the east of the British capital.


"HSBC has agreed the sale and leaseback of its head office
building in Canary Wharf, London for 1.09 billion pounds, the
largest single property deal in UK history," HSBC announced in an
official statement.
