Hong Kong share prices finished the Monday morning session 1.14
percent lower Monday as investors used China's latest hike in
bank reserve requirements as an excuse for profit-taking, dealers
said


They said there are fears that China could announce more
measures, including an interest rate hike, in the coming days as
it tries to cool down its economy after higher-than-expected
growth in the first quarter.


China's central bank announced Sunday that it will raise the
reserve requirement for commercial banks by another 50 basis
points, effective May 15.


The latest reserve requirement hike is the seventh such move
since the middle of last year and the second in a little over a
month.


The Hang Seng index ended the morning down 233.93 points at
20,292.57, off a low of 20,130.11 and a high of 20,525.96.
