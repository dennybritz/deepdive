Some 30,000 police were placed on alert from Monday to quell
possible May Day violence in the capital and surrounding areas, a
police spokesman said.


"We have had over a dozen notifications of planned rallies to
mark May Day," Jakarta police spokesman Ketut Untung Yoga Ana
told AFP.


He said police had obtained assurances from organisers that the
rallies would be peaceful, but thousands of officers would fan
out across the city and surrounding satellite towns in case of
unrest.


Various labour organisations have announced plans for mass
rallies to mark annual May 1 labour day celebrations on Tuesday.


The protests will be used to voice demands for better wages and
working conditions, as well as for a review of a 2003 labour law
that groups here say favours employers over the rights of
workers.


All rallies in Jakarta on Tuesday will eventually converge on the
main square in front of the palace.


May Day is not a public holiday in Indonesia.
