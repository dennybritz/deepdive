Archaeologists have found a 2,500-year-old tomb in eastern China
containing 40 coffins that could provide rare clues to life in
the region at the time, state media reported.


The number of coffins found in the tomb in east China's Jiangxi
province is unusual for that period in history, Fan Changsheng,
director of the Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Archeology, told
Xinhua news agency on Sunday.


Experts are wondering why so many were buried together and whose
remains are contained in the coffins, he said.


The tomb in Lijia village in Jing'an county is believed to date
back to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 to 221 BC). A team of
specialists will begin the delicate process of opening the
coffins this month.


The discovery will provide valuable clues to the study of social
customs, funeral rites and lifestyle in the area, Xinhua quoted
archaeologists as saying.


"The mystery inside the coffins will be revealed then," he said.


Archaeologists began protectively excavating the site in January
to thwart grave robbers who had attempted to open the rare
coffins.


The coffins were not damaged but some cultural relics were
removed from the site, according to local police. Some were later
recovered, including bronze woodworking tools, lacquered spoons
and wooden combs.
