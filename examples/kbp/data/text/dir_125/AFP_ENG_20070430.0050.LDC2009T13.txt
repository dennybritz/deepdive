Suspected Islamic rebels shot dead three people in Thailand's
restive Muslim- majority south, including a Buddhist man who was
beheaded and set alight, police said Monday.


The headless body of the 30-year-old was found along with the
charred body of his 14-year-old nephew on a road in Pattani, one
of three insurgency-torn southern provinces bordering Malaysia,
they said.


His head was discovered a few kilometers (miles) away.


Also in Pattani, a 60-year-old Muslim villager was gunned down
Sunday by suspected militants while taking care of his cattle
near his house, police said.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in three years of unrest
in the three southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani.


The military-backed government, which came to power after a
September coup, has made peace-building efforts in a bid to rein
in the insurgency, but violence has escalated in the last six
months.
