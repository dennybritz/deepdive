Three manual labourers from Thailand died in a fire early Monday
at their shack in a village in South Korea, police said.


The unidentified Thais were killed after their home in a
converted shipping container caught fire at Yanggu in Gangwon
province on the east coast.


"We noticed the place was on fire during a regular patrol of the
village and called firefighters," a policeman was quoted by
Yonhap news agency as saying.


"Upon entering the house after the fire was extinguished, we
found three bodies burnt beyond recognition."


It took 50 minutes for firefighters to control the blaze, police
said, adding they were trying to identify the dead and establish
the cause of the fire.
