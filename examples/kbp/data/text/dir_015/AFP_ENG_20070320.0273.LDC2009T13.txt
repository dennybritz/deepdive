Iraq's executed former vice president and aide of Saddam Hussein,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, was buried in the home village of the late
dictator on Tuesday, members of Saddam's tribe told AFP.


Ramadan was hanged before dawn on Tuesday in Baghdad for crimes
against humanity over his role in the killings of 148 Shiites
from the town of Dujail in the 1980s.


"The corpse of Ramadan was transported to Tikrit by US
helicopters and from there the police brought it to Awja for
burial," Sheikh Ali Nidr from Saddam's tribe who received the
body told AFP.


Saddam has been laid to rest inside a hall which used to be a
gathering place for condolence meetings during the former regime
in Awja, just outside the northern city of Tikrit.


"The body of Ramadan was washed and then buried in the garden of
the hall next to the graves of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad
Ahmed al-Bandar," Nidr said.


Barzan and Bandar were the other two former regime officials
hanged after Saddam himself was executed on December 30 for the
Dujail killings.


"We have decided to observe a three-day condolence period," Nidr
added.


Another member of the tribe, Zaki Ahmed, said hundreds of people
had gathered for Ramadan's burial in Awja.


"We had the honour to bury him next to his comrades as he was a
freedom fighter," Ahmed told AFP.


Last week Saddam's two sons Uday and Qusay were also reburied in
the garden next to Bandar and Barzan.


The two, killed by US troops during a gunbattle in the northern
city of Mosul in July 2003, were at first buried in a cemetery in
Awja.
