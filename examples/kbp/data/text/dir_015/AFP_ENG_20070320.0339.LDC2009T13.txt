Four car bombs and a mortar attack killed 16 people and wounded
dozens in Baghdad on Tuesday, security officials said, as Iraq
marked the fourth anniversary of the US-led invasion.


Insurgents have managed to carry out dozens of attacks in Baghdad
despite a massive US and Iraqi security crackdown in the capital
since February.


Seven people were killed and 20 wounded when several mortar
rounds slammed into southwest Baghdad's mixed district of Al-
Shuhada.


A security official said several of the victims were women and
children.


Four people were killed and 21 wounded when a car bomb exploded
in the Sheikh Omar industrial area of central Baghdad.


Another three people were killed and seven wounded when a car
bomb exploded in the Karrada district near the 14th of July
bridge.


A third car bomb attack killed one person and wounded six in
Mujamma al-Misham market in south Baghdad, well known for selling
tyres, batteries and other spare parts.


A suicide car bomb attack on an Iraqi military checkpoint in
Baghdad's western Jamiyah district killed one soldier.


About 90,000 US and Iraqi troops are patrolling the streets of
Baghdad to curb insurgent and sectarian violence.
