A senior United States official met on Tuesday for the first time
with a member of the new Palestinian unity cabinet, holding talks
with finance minister Salam Fayyad, officials said.


Jacob Walles, the American consul general in Jerusalem, met with
the respected US-educated technocrat in Fayyad's office in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian officials told AFP on
condition of anonymity.


It marked the first time that a senior US official meets with a
minister from the new Palestinian coalition cabinet, led by the
Islamist movement of Hamas, which is considered a terror group in
the West.


Fayyad, an independent, is a US-educated former official with the
International Monetary Fund.


He is widely respected in the West for his efforts to bring
greater transparency and clampdown on corruption during his first
time as Palestinian finance minister in 2002-2005.


A spokeswoman for the US consulate in Jerusalem declined to
comment.


"We will not be making any comments on the schedule of the consul
general today," spokeswoman Micaela Schweitzer-Bluhm said.


The US has refused to officially recognise the new government,
but has said it was not ruling out working with non-Hamas members
of the cabinet.


"Individuals who are not members of foreign terrorist
organisations but who do hold office in the unity government, we
do not rule out contact with those individuals," Schweitzer-Bluhm
said on Sunday.
