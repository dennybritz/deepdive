Bosnia's Serb Orthodox Church said Tuesday it is to begin
collecting evidence of atrocities committed against Serbs during
the country's war.


The aim of the task was to put together "objective documentation
on war crimes and genocide committed against Serb people in
Bosnia," priest Momir Vasiljevic told AFP.


The Serb Orthodox Church (SPC) had formed a commission tasked
with establishing the facts on war crimes and called on all Serbs
in possession of any evidence to present it, said Vasiljevic.


"The aim of the SPC is not to convict or judge anyone. This
country has institutions tasked with that. The SPC wants to
gather all evidence and to publish it," said Vasiljevic, a member
of the SPC's commission.


"It's never too late to tell the truth.


"We'll do this so that the public and Europe realise that it is
absurd to speak about the guilt of only one people," he said,
adding all people in Bosnia suffered during the inter-ethnic
conflict.


Bosnia's 1992-1995 war pitted Serbs against Muslims and Croats,
claiming tens of thousands of lives and forcing more than two
million people, or around half the country's population, to take
refuge.
