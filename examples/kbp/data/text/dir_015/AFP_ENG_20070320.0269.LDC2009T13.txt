Global steel giant Arcelor Mittal said Tuesday it would sell its
6.5-percent share in German firm RAG for a symbolic one euro,
removing an important obstacle to an initial public offering for
RAG.


A spokesman for Arcelor Mittal in Luxembourg said it had struck
the deal on Monday.


RAG has appealed to its major shareholders to sell their holdings
to allow it to be floated on the stock market either this year or
early next year.


Energy groups E.ON, RWE and ThyssenKrupp agreed last year to sell
their stakes.


European steelmaker Arcelor had dragged its feet because it had
valued its share in RAG at 200 million euros during its long and
unsuccessful battle last year to ward off a takeover by Mittal
Steel.


RAG has interests in energy, coal mining, property and chemicals.


Profits from its public offering should go towards a fund to
finance the planned closure of the country's coal mining industry
by 2018.


But politicians, both at a federal level and in the western state
of North Rhine-Westphalia where RAG's activities are
concentrated, have repeatedly called into doubt the idea and
proposed breaking up RAG and selling its different divisions.


They argue that this will raise more cash.
