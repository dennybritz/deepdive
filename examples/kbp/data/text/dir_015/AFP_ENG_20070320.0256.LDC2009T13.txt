US housing starts rebounded with a surprisingly strong nine
percent jump in February after a big slump in the prior month,
the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.


The report showed housing starts at an annualized pace of 1.525
million, well ahead of Wall Street forecasts of 1.445 million and
defying expectations of a further slide in the troubled real
estate market.


The agency revised down its estimate for January to a pace of
1.399 million from 1.408 million. The initial estimate had marked
the lowest level of starts in nine years.


Even with the rebound in February, housing starts are down 28.5
percent from a year earlier.


New construction fell steadily last year as the market was
buffeted by rising interest rates and slowing demand following
years of spectacular growth which unleashed a speculative frenzy
in some cities.
