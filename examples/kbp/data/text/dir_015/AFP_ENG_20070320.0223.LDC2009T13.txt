Arab League chief Amr Mussa on Tuesday said an Arab summit later
this month expects Israel to make a serious offer on peace
instead of resorting to "tricks" to waste time.


"We expect an offer, a position from Israel in so far as peace is
concerned," Mussa told reporters in Amman following talks with
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib on the March 28-29
summit in Saudi Arabia.


"We fail to see any offer, any talk about serious peace," the
secretary general said ahead of a meeting with King Abdullah II
as part of a regional tour to prepare for the summit.


"What we see is the same old policy of building (Jewish)
settlements, of procrastination, of resorting to tricks one after
the other in order to waste time," Mussa said.


Mussa reiterated the Arabs' refusal to amend a Saudi peace
initiative first launched at a 2002 summit in Beirut and which
leaders hope to revive when they meet in Riyadh.


Israel is asking for modifications to the bid, which offers
normalisation of Arab ties with the Jewish state in exchange for
its pullout from Arab lands occupied in 1967 and the
establishment of a Palestinian state.


Earlier this month Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said two
clauses concerning the right of return of Palestinian refugees
were "very problematic" for her country.


One calls for the return of Palestinians who fled or were forced
out in 1948, the other rules out their permanent settlement in
the Arab states where they or their descendants currently live.


"We are not ready to enter into any changes or any discussion
about the contents of the initiative," Mussa said.
