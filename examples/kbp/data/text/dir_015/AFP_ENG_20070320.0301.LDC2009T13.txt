South Africa captain Graeme Smith won the toss and elected to
bowl in the World Cup Group A match against Scotland at Warner
Park here on Tuesday.


South Africa left out paceman Andre Nel from their line-up which
beat the Netherlands by 221 runs in the first match to give pace
spearhead Makhaya Ntini a work out before their final match
against Australia on March 24.


Ntini missed the first match to attend the birth of his daughter
back home.


Scotland were playing without their regular captain Craig Wright
who went back home to attend the funeral of a family member. Ryan
Watson replaced him as captain.
