Israel's main workers' union Histadrut on Tuesday called for an
open-ended general strike beginning on Wednesday to protest over
unpaid civil servant wages.


"The strike will begin Wednesday at 6:00 am (0400 GMT) and will
last for an unlimited time," Histadrut's secretary general Ofer
Eini told a press conference. "The strike will continue until all
civil servants receive their wages."


Eini said the union was calling for the strike to protest against
unpaid salaries in the public sector. The union claims that
employees in around 40 local councils have gone without pay for
months.


If it goes through, the strike could paralyse the country's
essential services, including its international airport and all
its ports, as well as all government offices.


On February 27, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert averted
another threatened strike by the union after he promised to
resolve the unpaid wages crisis.
