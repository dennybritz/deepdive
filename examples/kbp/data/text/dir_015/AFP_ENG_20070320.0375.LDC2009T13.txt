Two Turkish soldiers were wounded after a landmine exploded
during a security operation in a southeastern province, a local
official said on Tuesday.


The incident occurred in the Bitlis region and is thought to be
connected to the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the
Anatolia news agency citing the local governor, reported.


Mevlut Atbas, the governor of Bitlis, said the two soliders
stepped on the mine during a security sweep in the countryside.


The PKK, considered a terrorist organisation by the Turkish
government and much of the international community, announced a
unilateral ceasefire last October.


Ankara rejected it, but the fighting -- which has seen more than
37,000 people killed since the PKK's armed campaign for self-rule
began in 1984 -- has largely subsided since then.
