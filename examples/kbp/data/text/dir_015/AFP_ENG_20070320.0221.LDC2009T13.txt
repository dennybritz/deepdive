Britain's Foreign Office declined to comment Tuesday on a report
that the UN's envoy for Kosovo is proposing independence for the
Albanian-populated Serbian province, but said it backs his draft
plans.


"The report will be presented to the UN on the 26th of March --
we wouldn't be commenting in advance," said a ministry spokesman,
after the French daily Le Monde cited excerpts from Marti
Ahtisaari's confidential report.


But he told AFP: "We fully support the UN special envoy and his
draft settlement proposal," noting that "these proposals will
hold out the prospect of a future for all communities in Kosovo.


"We are now waiting the final proposals taking into account the
recent consultations in Vienna. We believe the proposals have
broad and generous guarantees for Kosovo Serbs and Albanian
communities."


According to Le Monde, Ahtisaari wrote that "maintaining an
international administration was not tenable" for Kosovo but that
its "reintegration into Serbia was not a viable option."


"The time has come to determine the status of Kosovo," said
Ahtisaari, following eight years of UN rule in the province.


"Independence under international supervision is the only viable
option" for Kosovo... Independence offers the only guarantee
against the risk" of instability, he said.


"It's also the only chance for a sustainable partnership with
Serbia."
