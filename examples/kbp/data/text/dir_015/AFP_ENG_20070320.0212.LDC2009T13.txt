Britain's public finances recorded a deficit for the month of
February, official data showed on Tuesday.


The public sector net cash requirement (PSNCR), the public
sector's need to raise cash, showed a deficit of 1.874 billion
pounds (2.752 billion euros, 3.664 billion dollars) last month,
the Office for National Statistics said.


The deficit figure was in line with analysts' consensus forecast.


British finance minister Gordon Brown was meanwhile expected to
flag the country's on-track public finances in his annual budget
report on Wednesday.
