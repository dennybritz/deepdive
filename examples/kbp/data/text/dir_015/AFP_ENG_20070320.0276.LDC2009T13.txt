The German army never received thanks from world football body
FIFA for its work at last year's World Cup, the parliament's
special commissioner for the military said on Tuesday.


"The organiser of the World Cup, FIFA, never felt disposed to
give a clear sign of its recognition" of the army's efforts,
Reinhold Robbe said in the presentation of his annual report for
2006.


The German army provided doctors and medical personnel for the
month-long finals, although security duties were carried out
mainly by the police.


It received thanks from the German federal government, state
governments and the German Football Federation (DFB), but none
from FIFA, Robbe said.
