A Bosnian man robbed his own betting shop of 225,000 euros
(300,000 dollars) in a calculated gamble that left police baffled
for weeks, officials said Tuesday.


Police said they were left perplexed by the case in which Jakov
Pinjuh, the owner of the "Williams" betting shop in the southern
town of Siroki Brijeg, reported the theft of the money from a
cashier.


They launched an intense enquiry, only to get an admission two
weeks later from Pinjuh that he had staged the crime in a bid to
test his "negligent" employees.


"We worked around the clock because it was the biggest 'robbery'
we ever had," police spokesman Damir Cutura told AFP.


The workers were the prime suspects in the investigation, but
Pinjuh later confessed that he himself had "hidden the money to
see if his employees would even notice," said Cutura.


Police were to report the case to public prosecutors, who would
decide whether to press charges against the betting shop owner.
