Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq faces his last one-day
international on Wednesday in a mood of deep despondency over Bob
Woolmer's death but optimistic for the team's future.


Inzamam has been a central figure in the Pakistan side ever since
he starred with a blistering 60 from 37 balls in the semi-finals
of the 1992 World Cup against New Zealand at Auckland.


Since then, he has played 377 matches, scoring 11,702 runs at
39.53, including 10 hundreds.


"Every player has to go some day, and I've had my innings, but
you can't really choose the way you leave," said Inzamam ahead of
Pakistan's final World Cup outing against Zimbabwe.


"In my view, my resignation won't affect things much. There are
senior players who might be even better than me at doing this
job. With God's grace, they'll be even more successful."


Pakistan have endured a miserable World Cup.


A shock defeat to Ireland on Saturday, which condemned them to an
early exit, was followed on Sunday by the death of Woolmer.


"We'll do our best for Bob, but whatever we do, it won't be
enough," said Inzamam.


"He was a good man. Whenever any of the boys had a problem, he'd
sit with them, and we were very attached to him.


"After the game (on Saturday), he went to all the boys and
cheered them up. He told them that these things happen in life.
That was his greatest quality. Even in the bad times, he would
think positive."
