Two-time Olympic medallist Frankie Fredericks of Namibia will act
as an advisor for the German men's 4x100metre relay team, the
German Athletics Federation (DLV) announced Tuesday.


Fredericks won the 200m world title in Stuttgart in 1993 and was
the Olympic silver medallist over 100m in 1992 and 1996.


"We want our relay team to become competitive again for the world
championships and the Olympic Games," explained German coach
Jurgen Mallow.


The German team were fifth in the European championships last
year and finished seventh at the 2005 worlds in Helsinki.


Fredericks, 39, retired in 2004.
