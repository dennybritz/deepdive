A fire at a chemical plant in central Japan injured 17 people on
Tuesday and forced the evacuation of dozens of local residents,
officials said.


The cause of the blast at the chemical plant run by Shin-Etsu
Chemical Co. in central Niigata prefecture was unknown, a fire
department spokeswoman said.


Thirty-seven local residents were ordered to evacuate to nearby
schools and public offices, although the fire was later brought
under control, she said.


"I thought the ceiling would fall off on me," one local resident
told Japanese television.
