Russia condemned on Tuesday the execution of Saddam Hussein's
former vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, as a "settling of
scores" which damages stability in Iraq.


"We should seek understanding and national reconciliation and not
make demonstrative gestures that look like score settling,"
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists in
Moscow.


"It adds nothing positive to current efforts to bring the
situation back to normality."


Ramadan is the fourth ex-regime figure in Iraq, including Saddam
himself, to be executed for the killing of 148 Shiites from the
town of Dujail after the ousted Iraqi strongman escaped an
assassination bid there in 1982.


Earlier, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin
said: "We regret the punishment of the former vice-president of
Iraq and we emphasise again that events like this do not help to
stabilise the situation," Interfax reported.


"Only the launch of an effective dialogue between all the forces
in Iraq in a process involving the international community --
including Iraq's neighbours -- can make possible the genuine
stabilisation of the situation," Kamynin said.


Ramadan's execution was also criticised by US-based Human Rights
Watch which said there was insufficient evidence linking him to
the Dujail murders.
