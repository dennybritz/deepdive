Wall Street opened lower Tuesday despite the release of a
government report that showed a surprise rebound in housing
starts and as Federal Reserve policymakers prepared to mull US
interest rates.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 9.85 points (0.08
percent) to 12,216.32 in initial deals, giving back some gains
after spiking over 100 points Monday.


The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.67 points (0.03 percent) to
2,393.74 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index
shed 1.11 points (0.08 percent) to 1,400.95.


Stocks cooled despite the Commerce Department reporting that US
housing starts rebounded an unexpected nine percent in February
following a hefty slump in the prior month.


Despite the rebound, however, starts are still down significantly
from a year earlier amid a downturn in the nation's housing
market.


The housing report was released as Fed policymakers gathered in
Washington for a two day meeting. Most economists expect the Fed
to keep its short term interest rate pegged at 5.25 percent.
