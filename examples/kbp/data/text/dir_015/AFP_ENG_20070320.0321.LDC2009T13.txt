The Qatari gas company RasGas announced Tuesday the opening of a
new gas-to- liquids (GTL) plant which has an annual production
capacity of 4.7 million tonnes.


"RasGas (Train) 5 project ... will put Qatar at the forefront of
countries producing liquefied natural gas," RasGas managing
director Mohammad Saleh al- Sada said in the opening ceremony.


He said the total cost of the project was around 1.7 billion
dollars.


It is located in Ras Laffan Industrial City, 80 kilometres (50
miles) north of the capital Doha.


"As this project starts operation, the GTL production of RasGas
and Qatar Petroleum will increase to 30.7 million tonnes," per
year, he said.


Rasgas was established in 1993. State-run Qatar Petroleum owns a
63 percent stake, with Exxonmobil, Japan's Itochu Corp.. Nissho
Iwai Corp. and and a consortium of South Korean companies, Kogas,
holding the balance.


In January, Qatar announced that production has begun at its
first GTL plant -- also at Ras Laffan. The one-billion-dollar
project was a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and South
African company Sasol.


Qatar, which has the world's third-largest gas reserves and is
pushing to become the biggest LNG exporter, aspires to have a
total annual production capacity of 77 million tonnes in 2010.


The Gulf state's giant North Field has proven reserves of more
than 900 trillion cubic feet (25 trillion cubic metres) of
natural gas, amounting to more than 15 percent of proven global
reserves.
