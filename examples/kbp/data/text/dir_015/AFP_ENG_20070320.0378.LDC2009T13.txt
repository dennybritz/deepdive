India captain Rahul Dravid breathed a sigh of relief that under-
fire batsman Virender Sehwag made a timely return to form with a
century against Bermuda.


Sehwag, who was dropped down the order to number three, had made
just one half- century in his last 14 matches before Monday's
257-run win against Bermuda and was facing mounting calls for him
to be dropped.


But Dravid stuck by the player and Sehwag responded in style with
an 87-ball 114 with three sixes and 17 fours.


"Viru (Sehwag) is a very good player and I'm happy he's part of
my team -- a key member. He's back in form just when we need him
before a very critical match," said Dravid.


Sehwag was named man-of-the-match after scoring his eighth
hundred, but first in nearly two years.


"The effort he has put in is fantastic. All credit to him. We
expect a lot from him. He has been picked to score more than one
hundred for us," said Dravid.


Sehwag said a big innings from him was long overdue.


"I had the confidence. I knew the captain, coach and selectors
were backing me and I had to deliver," he said.


"I was waiting for just one innings. It was due for a long time.
Thank God, it has come at the right time. So I am happy with my
performance."


India, who suffered a shock five-wicket defeat against Bangladesh
in their opening Group B game, still need to beat Sri Lanka on
Friday to boost their chances of advancing to the Super Eight
stage.
