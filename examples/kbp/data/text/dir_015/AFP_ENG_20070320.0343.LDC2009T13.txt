Pakistan denied on Tuesday that the World Cup team had been
ordered to stay in Jamaica until the investigation into coach Bob
Woolmer's death was completed.


"We hope to get an autopsy report later Tuesday and see all the
investigation complete by Wednesday. All such reports of
detaining the team are baseless," Pakistan team media manager
Pervez Mir told AFP.


Pakistan were knocked out of the World Cup on Saturday by
Ireland.


On Sunday, 58-year-old Woolmer died after being found unconscious
in his hotel room in Jamaica.


"Any official can stay back until the process of taking the body
to Cape Town in South Africa is completed. We are responsible
people and will cooperate in the process," said Mir, a former
international player.


"Initially we thought a family member of Woolmer would come to
take the body but none of them will be coming. So this is our
responsibility to take the body to South Africa. Some of the
players are also keen to attend the funeral," said Mir.


The Pakistan team is expected to leave for home on Thursday after
their final group game against Zimbabwe on Wednesday.


Mir added the various rumours over the causes of Woolmer's death
have upset the team.


"There is some irresponsible speculation," said Mir.


"We can't know the cause of death until and unless we get the
autopsy report, so please don't speculate. We will let everyone
know the result of the investigations."
