Who's saying what at the World Cup:


"The real challenge is ahead of us. We had two must-win matches,
but have won just one."


- India captain Rahul Dravid speaking after his team's record-
breaking 257-run win over hapless Bermuda helped boost its
chances of advancing to the Super Eight stage.


"Our team has not performed well and for this reason the entire
selection committee has resigned."


- Pakistan chief selector Wasim Bari reacting to his team's first
round exit from the World Cup.


"I was thinking about Gibbs's record when I got the third, but
it's hard to hit the ball out of the ground here - the roof is
too high."


- West Indies all-rounder Chris Gayle after smashing three
successive sixes in one over and admitting he had wanted to equal
South African Herschelle Gibbs's record of six-in-a-row.


"Sometimes I have the capacity to go a bit further than maybe I
should do. It's something I'm aware of and it's something I'm
saying won't happen again."


- Contrite Andrew Flintoff speaking after his alcohol-fuelled
exploits that culminated in him being helped to shore after
falling off a pedalo just 24 hours before England's game against
Canada.


"After my first hit, I felt confident in the mid-wicket area and
I just went for my shots."


- Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh speaking after his quickfire
46-ball 83 against Bermuda which included seven massive sixes.
