Some 95,000 people have fled fierce fighting in Sri Lanka's
eastern Batticaloa district in the past week, the UN food relief
agency said Tuesday.


World Food Programme spokesman Simon Pluess said the fighting
between government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels in the area had
triggered a "dramatically increased number of displaced."


The WFP said in a statement that the 95,000 had added to the
burden of providing food for some 60,000 Sri Lankans who were
already displaced in the area.


"WFP appeals today to the government and the LTTE (Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam) to grant us unimpeded access," Pluess told
journalists.


The agency has received just one-third of its funding and
existing UN stocks of food in Sri Lanka were expected to run dry
by the end of April, he added.


Batticaloa has been the scene of major ground battles between the
rebels and government forces in recent days.
