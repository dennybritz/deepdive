Deep-pocketed bidders battled Tuesday to win a coveted meeting
with former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, one of a
constellation of stars on offer in a charity auction.


The website www.charitybuzz.com launched its latest auction to
raise money for the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, a non-profit
group that provides funding to human-rights causes.


Face-time with CNN talk-show host Larry King, comedian Robin
Williams, movie legend Richard Gere and skateboard star Tony Hawk
were also on offer to the highest bidder.


A lunch with glamorous former CIA spy Valerie Plame and her
husband Joseph Wilson was another attraction for those curious
about two people center-stage of a Washington scandal involving
the government and the Iraq war.


Breakfast or tea for up to four people with Greenspan and his
wife, NBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, carried an estimated
value of 5,000 dollars.


But that would be small change to any Wall Street type keen to
get an insight into the thinking of a man who, despite retiring
from the US central bank a year ago, still has the power to move
markets.


A warning from Greenspan that the United States could be
struggling to stave off a recession later this year contributed
to a rout on global stock markets in late February.


Bidding on the charity auction ends on April 6.
