British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's actions in the run-up
to the 1982 Falklands War will be the focus of a feature film by
BBC Films and Pathe, the BBC said Tuesday.


The pair have commissioned a script about the period which forged
Thatcher's reputation as the "Iron Lady" when she sent British
troops to evict Argentine occupation forces from the Falkland
Islands in the south Atlantic.


The project comes as Britain prepares to mark the 25th
anniversary of the Falklands War.


"It's just very much the start of the whole affair," a BBC
spokesman, Charles McDonald, told AFP, adding that no director
had yet been named nor a screenplay written.


Following a series of unauthorised Argentine landings on South
Georgia, Argentina's forces under the military government headed
by General Leopoldo Galtieri occupied the tiny islands off its
southern coast on April 2, 1982.


Britain retook the islands within a couple of months, after
sending a task force to the remote south Atlantic.


London has occupied the territory since 1833 but Buenos Aires
claims the land as its own amid decades of failed negotiations
over the Falklands' sovereignty.


The Guardian newspaper's film critic Peter Bradshaw suggested a
number of actresses who could play Thatcher in the new film.


He mentioned US actress Sharon Stone as well as Kika Markham, who
played Thatcher in "The Line of Beauty" on television, as well as
Sylvia Sims who portrayed her on stage in 1994 in "Half the
Picture."
