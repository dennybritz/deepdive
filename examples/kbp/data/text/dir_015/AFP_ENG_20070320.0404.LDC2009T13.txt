A photograph published Tuesday in a Colombian daily shows a
lively Fidel Castro speaking with writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
the newest evidence that the Cuban leader appears to be
recovering from surgery.


The picture in El Tiempo shows the two in what appears to be a
garden in a residence speaking with the Colombian Nobel Prize-
winning novelist, who visited Castro in Havana on March 12.


Dressed in a sweatshirt in Cuban colors, Castro is addressing
Garcia Marquez, who is smiling and listening attentively.


On Monday Garcia Marquez told AFP that "Fidel is very well,
better than many think."


Castro has been mostly out of sight since turning over power July
31 to his brother Raul while he recovers from intestinal surgery.


However, his lengthy convalescence has generated much speculation
as to whether he will return to power.


Cuba's Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said in Portugal on
Friday that Castro had gained weight and is exercising daily.


Earlier last week Garcia Marquez told the Colombian daily El Pais
after he returned from Cuba that "he is the same Fidel as
always."


The two 80-year-old men walked "for miles", Garcia Marquez said.


"Fidel is a force of nature," he said, adding that "with him, you
never know."
