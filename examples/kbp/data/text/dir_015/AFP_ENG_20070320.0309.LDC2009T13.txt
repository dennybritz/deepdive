Valencia and Inter Milan both filed appeals on Tuesday with
European football's top governing body UEFA over penalties
incurred after a mass brawl in their Champions League tie two
weeks ago.


The appeals hearing will take place at the UEFA headquarters in
Nyon, Switzerland on March 28, and all of the players have been
summoned to attend, UEFA said in a statement.


UEFA fined both clubs 155,772 euros (207,223 dollars) and
suspended Valencia defender David Navarro for seven months, after
he broke the nose of Inter's Nicolas Burdisso in the punch-up.


Burdisso picked up a six match ban for his part in the flare up
at the end of the acrimonious last 16 second leg tie on March 6
which ended goalless but saw Valencia go through to the quarter-
finals on the away goals rule.


Burdisso's teammate Maicon was also hit with a six match ban
while UEFA's disciplinary committee dished out three and two
match suspensions respectively to two further Inter players, Ivan
Cordoba and Julio Cruz.


Valencia player Carlos Marchena was also hit with a four-match
ban for his role in the incident.
