The US affiliate of Munich Re, the world's second biggest
reinsurance company, on Tuesday posted a net loss of 1.03 billion
dollars (775 million euros) for 2006.


The firm performed poorly for a second year in a row partly
because it had to raise its provisions for pay-outs on claims
linked to asbestos to 600 million dollars, it said in its annual
report.


Higher taxes also took their toll on its US affiliate, which was
recently renamed Munich Reinsurance America.


"We do not expect that Munich Re will again have to raise its
provisions for asbestos problems," a spokeswoman for the company
said.


In 2005, its US affiliate registered a net loss of 1.53 billion
dollars as a result of the devastating hurricanes that hit the
United States and the Gulf of Mexico.


Munich Re has in recent years repeatedly bailed out its loss-
making US affiliate, but the spokeswoman said on Tuesday there
was no question of dumping it.
