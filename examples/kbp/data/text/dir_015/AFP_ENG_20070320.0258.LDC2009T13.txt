Iran on Tuesday denied a report that Russia would not deliver
nuclear fuel for its atomic plant unless Tehran complied with UN
demands and suspend controversial enrichment work.


Citing unnamed officials, the New York Times said on Tuesday that
the Russian national security head, Igor Ivanov, delivered the
ultimatum last week to Iran's deputy chief nuclear negotiator Ali
Hosseini Tash.


"I deny this report," Hosseini Tash told state radio.


"It was completely the opposite. Mr Ivanov was trying to convince
us that the issue of Bushehr plant is not linked to the nuclear
dossier," he said.


Moscow infuriated Tehran last week by cancelling its March
deadline to deliver fuel for the much-delayed Bushehr plant it is
building in the south of the country because Iran had not met its
financial commitments.


Iran denied the charge, insisting it had paid beyond the agreed
amount.


The United States, which accuses Iran of seeking to develop
nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian programme, has
urged Russia to cut off assistance for Iran's Bushehr plant.


The report came as the UN Security Council was set to review a
draft resolution that would toughen punitive measures against
Iran for its refusal to suspend enrichment.


The Security Council imposed sanctions on Iran's nuclear and
missile programmes in December after it failed to freeze uranium
enrichment, the process which can be used to make nuclear fuel as
well as atomic weapons.


Iran says its nuclear programme is solely aimed at peaceful
energy ends.
