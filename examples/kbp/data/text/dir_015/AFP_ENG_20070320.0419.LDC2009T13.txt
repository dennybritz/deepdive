Vice President Dick Cheney, who suffers from circulatory
problems, returned on Tuesday to hospital for a checkup on blood
clots in his legs, his office said.


"He went to his doctor's office at the George Washington medical
facility for a routine check-up on his leg," Cheney spokeswoman
Megan McGinn said, stressing that Cheney did not return to
hospital.


She said that he was expected to return to work later Tuesday.


On March 5, Cheney, who has suffered four heart attacks and wears
a defibrillator, sought medical attention for a blood clot in his
left leg and began treatment with blood-thinning medication that
was expected to last months.


Cheney, 66, and the man who would lead the United States if
President George W. Bush is incapacitated, had traveled some
25,000 miles and logged 65 hours on an airplane on a nine-day
trip prior to discovery of the clots.


Once a heavy smoker, he has a history of coronary problems,
experiencing his first heart attack in 1978 when he was only 38
-- the same year he won the first of five two-year terms in
Congress representing Wyoming.


He had his fourth heart attack in 2000, the year he and Bush won
election to the White House. He underwent an angioplasty weeks
after being sworn in as vice president in 2001.


In September 2005 he had an operation for blood clots behind each
of his knees, and in January 2006 he was hospitalized for
shortness of breath.
