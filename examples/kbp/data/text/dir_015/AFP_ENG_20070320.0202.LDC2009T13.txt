Indian troops arrested 18 Myanmar fishermen for poaching in the
Andaman and Nicobar islands as part of a new crackdown, an
official said Tuesday.


They were arrested overnight in a remote part of the archipelago
by a recently formed anti-poaching force, agency chief K.C.
Divedi said in the Andamans administrative capital of Port Blair.


"These men were arrested last night while they were poaching sea
cucumbers and other banned marine products," Divedi told AFP.


The island chain, which is closer to Myanmar and Indonesia than
India, is a favourite poaching ground of fishermen who use rowing
boats to evade military radar sites that string the area.
