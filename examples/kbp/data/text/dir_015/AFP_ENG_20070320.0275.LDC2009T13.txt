A Portuguese judge on Tuesday ordered Benfica to pay 600,000
euros in compensation to bitter rivals Porto for Hungarian
striker Miklos Feher, who died in 2004.


Feher was playing for Benfica at the time and died on the pitch
during a match after suffering a cardiac arrest.


He had previously played for Porto from 1998-2002 having arrived
in the country from Hungary at the age of 18.


The order to pay compensation is over the player's sporting
rights, which Porto maintained a share in even after his
transfer.
