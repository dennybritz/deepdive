Iraqi security forces killed 39 "terrorists" in a fierce battle
in the western Sunni province of Al-Anbar on Tuesday, a top Iraqi
official told AFP.


Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf, director of the operations
centre in the interior ministry, said seven other militants were
arrested, including some Arab nationals.


The clashes broke out early Tuesday in Ameriyah, southwest of the
former rebel town of Fallujah, and the site of a recent chlorine
gas attack.
