A judicial panel has delayed its next hearing into charges
against Pakistan's top judge following his removal by President
Pervez Musharraf from Wednesday until April 3, officials said.


"The Supreme Judicial Council has adjourned the hearing of an
application filed by Mr. Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in the
reference against him to April 3, 2007," Supreme Court spokesman
Arshad Munir told AFP.


"Notices to all concerned have been issued accordingly."


He did not give a reason.


The postponement comes after hardline Islamist parties and
lawyers threatened to hold further protests coinciding with the
hearing in support of Chaudhry, who was removed on April 9.


Violent demonstrations erupted when Chaudhry appeared before the
council on Friday.
