The Afghan government admitted Tuesday to freeing some Taliban
prisoners in exchange for the release of an Italian hostage,
saying it was an "exceptional measure" that would not be
repeated.


The Taliban freed Daniele Mastrogiacomo on Monday after capturing
him in the southern province of Helmand on March 4, along with an
Afghan translator and a driver.


The driver was beheaded and the fate of the translator is
unclear.


"They had some demands and their demands to some extent were
accepted," presidential spokesman Karim Rahimi told reporters.


Asked if he could confirm some Taliban were exchanged for the
reporter, he replied: "Yes." He did not say how many.


Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah said through an Afghan news
agency Monday that he freed the Italian after receiving five
Taliban prisoners.


"It was an exceptional measure taken because we value our
relations and friendship with Italy," Rahimi said. "It won't be
repeated."


The spokesman said, without elaborating, that one of the Taliban
demanded by commander Dadullah "refused to go."


"The government really appreciates his decision," Rahimi said.


Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP last week that the
movement wanted former spokesman Mohammad Hanif, arrested in
Afghanistan this year, to be returned.


Hanif, who was shown on Afghan television claiming links between
the Taliban and Pakistan's intelligence agency, was not among the
five returned to the Taliban.


The deal to free Mastrogiacomo has raised concern, with United
Nations spokesman in Afghanistan Adrian Edwards saying Tuesday
"the UN does not negotiate with terrorists."
