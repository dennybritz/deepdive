Sixty-five people were killed and seven injured in the west
African state of Guinea after the lorry in which they were
travelling toppled into a lake.


Officials said the accident late Monday near the town of
Gueckedou, about 700 kilometres (400 miles) southeast of the
capital was one of the deadliest in decades.


The van topppled into the water when it tried to cross a narrow
bridge, according to survivors.


"The vehicle overturned into a lake. There were 65 dead," said a
doctor at Gueckedou hospital. Thirty-nine of those killed were
women, eight of them pregnant.


The truck, carrying 72 people, was heading to a weekly market in
Koudou, 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Gueckedou, near the
border with Sierra Leone.


Claiming the truck was overloaded, police have opened an
investigation into the disaster.


One police source said it was the worst road accident "in the
past 30 years."


The driver and six passengers who were seriously injured were
taken to Gueckedou hospital.


Witnesses said most of the casualties were Guinean traders.


"Never since independence (in 1958) have we had such a fatal
accident in this country," Alpha Djouma Diallo, leader of a local
trade union for the transport sector told AFP.


Due to insufficient public transport, trucks are often used to
ferry people in parts of Africa. Bad roads have also contributed
to high rates of fatal accidents.
