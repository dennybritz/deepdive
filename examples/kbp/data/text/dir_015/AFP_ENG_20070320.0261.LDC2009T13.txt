A Zambian court trying ailing former president Frederick Chiluba
for corruption and abuse of office Tuesday allowed him to travel
to South Africa for medical treatment.


Magistrate Jones Chinyama granted an application by Chiluba's
lawyers for him to travel to South Africa for treatment for a
heart condition. Government did not object to the application.


Chiluba was to leave on Tuesday with his wife, Regina, who has
been given permission to travel by another court in which she was
charged with receiving stolen goods.


The embattled former leader is on trial for corruption and theft
of public funds that he and his top aides allegedly stole during
his decade-long stint as president until he retired in 2001.


Chiluba's deteriorating health has contributed to frequent
adjournments of the court case as an acute heart condition has
rendered him unable to sit in court for long hours.


Three senior officials who served under Chiluba have been jailed
for five years each in separate cases for their role in
corruption and theft of public funds.


Zambia's President Levy Mwanawasa who succeeded Chiluba declared
the fight against corruption as his government's priority, and
has sacked several high ranking politicians -- including his
minister for land -- for being involved in corrupt activities.
