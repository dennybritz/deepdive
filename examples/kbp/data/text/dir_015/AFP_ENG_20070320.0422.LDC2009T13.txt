Spain wants competitiveness, rather than national interests to
determine the awarding of contracts by European aerospace group
EADS, Spanish Industry Minister Joan Clos said Tuesday.


"Things will go badly for EADS if it has to continue investing on
the basis of (national) quotas and not competitiveness," Clos
told a forum organised by financial daily Cinco Dias.


Countries should "win contracts not because of quotas but on
competition, on which our future depends," Clos said.


He added that a "very important objective" for Madrid was
bolstering its stake in EADS from a current 5.5 percent to 10
percent.


Increased focus on competitiveness was important because Spanish
industry must "win contracts, (but) not through quotas," he said.


To date, EADS-related investments have been made on the basis of
each country's stake in the group, which is dominated by France
and Germany.


The group is controlled by a combination of public and private
investors which either represent the Paris and Berlin governments
or have close links with them.


Close said that Spanish efficiency had limited the extent to
which announced Airbus job losses had hit its aerospace plants
amid a restructuring scheme proposing the elimination of 10,000
jobs in Europe.


The cuts, together with the total or partial disposal of six
sites, are intended to save 5.0 billion euros (6.6 billion
dollars) by 2010.


Only 400 Spanish jobs are set to be axed compared with 4,300 in
France, 3,700 in Germany and 1,600 in Britain.


Close said Spanish factories were "more efficient" and "more
competitive."
