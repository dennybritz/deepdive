Ten survivors of the devastating 2005 earthquake in Pakistani
Kashmir were killed Tuesday when a landslide triggered by
torrential rain buried their house, police said.


The accident occurred at Jabar Daray village, some 12 kilometres
(seven miles) north of mountainous Bagh district which was
devastated by the massive earthquake in October 2005, they said.


Ten people were killed and two others were pulled out of the
debris alive, a local police official said.


Most of the victims were relatives and rescue teams were
searching the rubble to ensure there were no other people in it,
he said.


The 7.6-magnitude quake on October 8, 2005 claimed more than
73,000 lives, seriously injured nearly 70,000 people and left 3.3
million homeless in Pakistan. More than 1,000 also died in Indian
Kashmir.
