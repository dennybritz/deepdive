Israeli police said they had questioned Finance Minister Avraham
Hirshson for seven hours on Tuesday as part of a probe into
corruption in a labour union that he once headed.


"Mr Hirshson was questioned by the police fraud department for
seven hours," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP.


In a statement, the police said Hirshson was suspected of
involvement in aggravated robbery and fraud, embezzlement,
obstruction of justice and conspiring to commit a crime.


In January, police confirmed media reports that a graft probe had
been launched against Hirshson, the latest in a string of Israeli
officials to face corruption charges.


Hirshson, a member of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's Kadima party,
has not commented on the allegations.


The allegations are part of an investigation into embezzlement of
13.5 million dollars from the National Workers Union Histadrut,
which Hirshson once headed.


Corruption probes and other scandals involving senior Israeli
officials have rocked the Jewish state during the past six
months.


Among them have been several graft probes against Olmert and a
looming rape indictment against President Moshe Katsav, who has
since taken a leave from the largely ceremonial post.
