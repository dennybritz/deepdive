Twenty-four people have been killed in fighting between heavily-
armed Uzbek Al- Qaeda militants and local tribesmen in northwest
Pakistan, officials said Tuesday.


Heavy exchanges of rocket and mortar fire broke out on Monday and
continued on Tuesday in Kalusha town in the troubled tribal
region of South Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan, security
officials said.


Four of the dead were teenagers killed when a shell hit a crowd
of students, seven were local tribesmen and 13 were followers of
wanted Uzbek militant Tahir Yuldashev, security officials said on
condition of anonymity.
