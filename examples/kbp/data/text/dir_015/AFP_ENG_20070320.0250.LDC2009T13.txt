A Pakistan-born US national accused of supplying military
equipment to Al-Qaeda lost Tuesday his legal battle in Britain
against extradition to the United States.


Syed Hashmi, 27, now faces trial in the United States over
allegations that he was a "quartermaster" who supplied the terror
network's operatives in Afghanistan and Pakistan.


His lawyers had argued that any trial should take place in
Britain and had no relevance to the United States. They also
claimed that arrest warrants against him were flawed.


But at London's High Court, Lord Justice Scott Baker and Justice
David Clarke said that this complaint was "without substance."


Hashmi, who was arrested at London Heathrow Airport last June as
he boarded a flight to Pakistan, came to Britain on a student
visa in 2003 and joined the Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun, which
has now disbanded.


His extradition warrant alleged that he had received "military
gear" for use in committing terrorist acts between January and
March 2004.


He was indicted by the United States District Court for the
southern district of New York.
