A Croatian man has died a month after he was overcome by a toxic
gas leak from a brewery owned by Dutch beer giant Heineken,
officials said Tuesday.


Zdravko Martinovic, 64, died late Monday at a hospital in the
central town of Karlovac, where he had been in a coma since the
incident on February 23, said a medical source.


He had lost consciousness while walking his dog beside a stream
near the Karlovacka Pivovara brewery, from which a large quantity
of carbon dioxide gas had escaped, according to a preliminary
judicial inquiry.


His dog had died on the spot.


After the incident, Croatian authorities suspended production at
the brewery.


In addition, local prosecutors opened an investigation and
questioned five senior brewery officials suspected of
"endangering the health and lives" of the surrounding population.


Dutch drinks giant Heineken -- which posted a profit of 1.2
billion euros (1.6 billion dollars) last year -- took control of
the factory on 2003.
