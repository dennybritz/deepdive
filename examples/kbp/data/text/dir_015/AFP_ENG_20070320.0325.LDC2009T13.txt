India has decided not to pursue a half-century-old request for
Myanmar to return the remains of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur
Shah Zafar, the government said Tuesday.


The government had received a request from the Bahadur Shah Zafar
Memorial Society in 1949 to bring the "mortal remains of the last
Mughal king from Yangon to New Delhi," the government said.


"It was decided that the proposal need not be pursued," Culture
Minister  Ambika Soni told parliament in a written statement,
without elaborating.


In 1857 at the age of 82, Zafar became leader of an uprising
against British colonial rule -- initially referred to as the
"Indian mutiny" but now known in India as "The First War of
Independence" -- despite preferring penning poetry to waging war.


The revolt was the largest the British Empire had ever faced and
transformed Delhi, the seat of the great Mughal capital, into a
battleground.


The insurrection caused "unimaginable casualties on both sides,"
according to Delhi-based British author William Dalrymple, who in
2006 published a book on the revolt.


Finally after four months of fighting, the British, backed by
Sikh and Pathan fighters, recaptured the city and massacred great
swathes of the population.


Though the royal family surrendered, most of the emperor's 16
sons were hung and Zafar, a name meaning paradoxically "victory,"
was humbled from "divine highness" to state prisoner.


Zafar was exiled to Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon, and died
in captivity five years later, the last of the emperors of the
once sprawling Mughal empire.
