England bowling coach Kevin Shine and spin mentor Jeremy Snape
have both been fined for their part in the England drinking
session that saw Andrew Flintoff stripped off the vice-captaincy
and left out of the side that beat Canada, a source close to the
team announced Monday.


Flintoff, the star of England's 2005 Ashes success, was one of
six players fined following a late-night drinking session after
the six-wicket defeat by New Zealand on Friday.


His alcohol-fuelled exploits then culminated in him taking a
pedalo out to sea in the early hours of Saturday morning.


The other players fined were James Anderson, Ian Bell, Jon Lewis,
Paul Nixon and Liam Plunkett.


Although the source wouldn't specify the individual fines, he
said that, in total, 10,000 pounds had been donated to the Chance
to Shine charity, which helps promotes cricket within British
state schools, by the six players and two coaches involved in the
drinking session.


England beat Canada by 51 runs on Sunday to get their World Cup
campaign back on track. Their final Group C match is against
Kenya this Saturday.
