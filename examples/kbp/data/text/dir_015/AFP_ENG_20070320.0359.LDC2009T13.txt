US and Panamanian police seized 19.4 tonnes of cocaine from a
freighter and arrested 14 people, the national prosecutor's
office said.


The drugs were seized on Sunday aboard a Panamanian-flagged
freighter in Panamanian waters, prosecutors said, without
revealing its destination or source.


The 14 arrested were Panamanian and Mexican nationals.


Last week, Panama seized 10 tonnes of ephedrine, used in the
manufacture of methamphetamine, a fast-growing drug of abuse in
the United States.


Panama and other Central American countries are common
transshipment stops for US-bound drugs from South America,
notably Colombia.
