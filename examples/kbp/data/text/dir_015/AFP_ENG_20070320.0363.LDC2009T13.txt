Bosnian police said they had arrested 11 would-be immigrants from
Albania on Tuesday after the group illegally crossed the
country's border with Montenegro.


The two women and nine men, detained near the southeastern town
of Trebinje, had intended "to reach Western Europe after
illegally entering Bosnia-Hercegovina," police said in a
statement.


It was the second such interception of illegal immigrants in the
former Yugoslavia within days, after a group of 15 Albanians and
Turks were detained at Croatia's northern border with Serbia on
Sunday.
