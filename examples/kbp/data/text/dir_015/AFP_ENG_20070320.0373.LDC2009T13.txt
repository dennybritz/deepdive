Russia has not threatened to withhold nuclear fuel for Iran's
Bushehr nuclear plant if Tehran does not suspend uranium
enrichment as demanded by the Security Council, its ambassador to
the UN said here Tuesday.


"I can tell you that the report (by The New York Times) is not
accurate, that there has been no Russian ultimatum to Iran of any
kind," Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters.


"We continue to regard the Bushehr project as something that is
outside the scope of (the UN sanctions resolutions)," he said.
