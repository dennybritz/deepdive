Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn on Tuesday apologised for his
behaviour during the post-match doping control after his team's
Champions League first knockout round second-leg tie against Real
Madrid.


Kahn and teammate Lucio were both charged with improper conduct
by UEFA and their cases are due to be heard before the
disciplinary committee of European football's governing body on
Thursday.


Bayern won the match 2-1 to progress to the quarter-finals on the
away goals ruling in a 4-4 aggregate scoreline.


"They way I expressed my frustration was not okay, I regret what
happened. It shouldn't have happened, that's why I want to
apologise to the doctor," said Kahn.


"I couldn't give a urine sample until two hours after the match -
it was nearly one o'clock in the morning, after a match with so
much at stake and tension I always have problems," explained the
goalkeeper.


"So when I finally gave my sample and the doctor told me I would
have to give him another because he wasn't present for the first,
I flew off the handle because I was tired, irritated and
frustrated," said the 37-year-old.


Kahn said however that he did not expect to be punished by UEFA.


"I've played over 100 Champions League matches and I've never
been suspended so I'm approaching this from the principle that I
will play AC Milan," he added. Bayern met AC Milan in the
quarter-final on April 3 and 11.
