Procter and Gamble Co. does not worship Satan, according to a US
court ruling that revolves around a decades-old urban myth
targeting the world's biggest consumer goods company.


P and G said late Monday it had won 19.25 million dollars in a
civil suit brought against four former distributors of direct-
selling company Amway who were accused of spreading false rumors.


Last Friday's jury award in Salt Lake City represents the latest
in a long line of court battles between P and G and Amway over
the devil-worshipping claim, which has taken on new currency in
the Internet era.


"This is about protecting our reputation," Jim Johnson, P and G's
chief legal officer, said in a statement.


"We will take appropriate legal measures when competitors
unfairly undermine the reputation of our brands or our company,"
he said.


The former distributors were accused of rehashing a rumor that
dates from at least 1981, to the effect that P and G is in league
with the Devil.


According to the false urban legend, the global company's logo
contains a "666" symbol, its bosses have appeared on television
talk shows to declare their love of Beelzebub, and part of its
profits go to the Church of Satan.


Amway, part of the Alticor Inc. group of companies, direct
retails products like consumer goods through independent sellers
in more than 80 countries.


Amway has itself been forced to debunk accusations that its
business model amounts to little more than a "get rich quick"
pyramid-selling scheme.
