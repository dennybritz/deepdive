The Danish group Vestas Wind Systems, the world's leading wind
energy company, said Tuesday it had returned to profit last year
thanks to robust sales and predicted a continued strong
performance in 2007.


Net earnings in 2006 came to 110.9 million euros (147 million
dollars) after a loss of 191.5 million in 2005. Vestas posted a
loss of 61 million euros in 2004.


The company's operating margin came to 5.2 percent last year from
sales that expanded 7.5 percent to 3.85 billion euros. Operating
profit rose to 201 million euros after a loss of 116 million in
2005.


Vestas said it was nonetheless facing a shortage of key
components in the face of strong demand for wind-powered energy.


"Together with its suppliers, Vestas still faces a large
challenge to secure components in the right quality and delivered
on time, which means that Vestas today has a significant
unexploited production capacity," the company said in a
statement.


Vestas disclosed in November that surging demand had imposed
delays of 12 to 15 months in the shipment of components and
warned that the situation would complicate its operations for
years to come.


Vestas last year sold wind turbines with a total capacity of
4,239 megawatts, an increase of 33 percent over 2005.


Looking ahead the group foresaw positive developments in 2007,
with sales coming to 4.5 billion euros and an operating margin of
between 7.0 and 9.0 percent.
