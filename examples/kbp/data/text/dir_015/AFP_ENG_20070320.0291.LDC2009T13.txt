France said Tuesday it would resume contacts with Palestinian
government members not belonging to the Hamas Islamist movement,
and repeated a call for a resumption of European aid to the
Palestinians.


"France is prepared to resume political contacts with those
members of the Palestinian government who are not drawn from
Hamas," foreign ministry spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei said.


"We consider that direct financial aid to the new governent
should be resumed and are currently defending that position among
our European counterparts," he added, saying that talks on the
matter were ongoing.


Palestinians have installed a new government uniting Hamas with
moderates in hopes that the West would lift a punishing aid and
diplomatic embargo imposed a year ago when the Islamists formed a
cabinet alone after winning the election.


The European Union and the United States -- which along with
Russia and the United Nations make up the Middle East peace
Quartet -- have said they would not recognise the new Palestinian
government until it agrees to demands to renounce violence,
recognise Israel and abide by past peace deals.


The EU is the main financial donor to the Palestinians, giving
almost 900 million dollars last year.


The EU ceased direct aid to the Palestinian government when Hamas
came to power following last year's election and subsequently set
up a temporary mechanism for sending aid, which was extended for
three months on Monday.
