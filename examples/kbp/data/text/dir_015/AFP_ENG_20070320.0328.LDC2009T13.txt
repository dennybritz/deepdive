The number of female smokers in New York has fallen by more than
120,000 since five years ago, when the city first put forward a
tough new ban on the use of tobacco, according to health
officials.


"The number of female smokers has fallen by 123,000 in New York
City since 2002 -- and young women are now about half as likely
to smoke as young men," the city's health department said in a
statement.


"Women are taking charge of their health," Health Commissioner
Thomas Frieden said in a statement. "And for tobacco companies,
that's bad news."


But he warned that big tobacco was increasing its marketing
spending and devising ever subtler ways to draw in female
smokers.


The drop in smoker numbers was greatest among young white women
living in Manhattan, the department said, with the prevalence of
female smokers falling from 20 percent city-wide in 2002 to 16
percent in 2005.


A report by the health department in December showed that the
number of smoking- related deaths recorded each year had fallen
from almost 9,000 in 2001 to just under 8,100 in 2005.


New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, himself a former smoker, put
forward one of the world's most aggressive anti-smoking policies
in 2002, banning the use of tobacco in bars, restaurants and
offices. It came into effect in 2003.
