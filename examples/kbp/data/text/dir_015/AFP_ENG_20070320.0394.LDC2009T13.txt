Spain international Juan Carlos Valeron must have another
operation this week in a further setback to his career which has
been hampered during the last year with a knee problem.


The 31-year-old midfielder, who has made 45 appearances for his
country, will go into a Madrid hospital on Friday for a third
operation to his left knee, Deportivo La Coruna club doctor Cesar
Cobian said at a press conference on Tuesday.


Cobian said: "His left knee is not allowing him to perform as an
elite footballer even after 14 months of medical treatment and
re-education."


Valeron first got injured in January 2006, with a recurrence in
July, and only returned to action on January 7 this year when
Deportivo beat Real Madrid 2-0.
