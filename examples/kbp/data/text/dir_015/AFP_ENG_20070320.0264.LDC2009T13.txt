Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik said Tuesday she had
invited her Palestinian counterpart Ziad Abu Amr to visit since
his new government gives a chance for peace in the Middle East.


The European Union and the United States -- which along with
Russia and the United Nations make up the Middle East peace
Quartet -- have said they would not recognise the new Palestinian
government until it agrees to demands to renounce violence,
recognise Israel and agree to abide by past peace deals.


But Plassnik said in a statement: "The new Palestinian national
unity government is a chance for a new beginning in the Middle
East."


She said it "opens the door for the first time to the possibility
(for the Palestinian administration) to normalize relations with
the international community."


Plassnik said she was convinced that Abu Amr would be "a pioneer
for cooperation with the international community."


Palestinians on Tuesday urged the world to work with their new
unity government, as major powers weighed up how to deal with an
administration led by the Islamist movement Hamas.


Palestinians installed a new government uniting Hamas with
moderates hoping that the West would lift a punishing aid and
diplomatic embargo imposed a year ago when the Islamists formed a
cabinet alone after a dramatic election win.


So far, the West has stopped short of recognising the government,
with only Norway saying officially it would work with the new
cabinet.
