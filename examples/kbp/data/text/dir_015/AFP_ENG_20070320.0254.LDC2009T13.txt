Serbia will never accept Kosovo's independence, a source in the
Serbian presidency said Tuesday after a report that the UN's
envoy was proposing supervised independence for the province.


"Any form of independence of Kosovo is unacceptable," said the
source, reiterating the stance of Serbian authorities in recently
ended talks on the future status of the mainly ethnic Albanian
southern province.


The source did not comment directly on an article earlier Tuesday
in the French daily Le Monde, which said UN envoy Martti
Ahtisaari was proposing independence for Kosovo in a confidential
report to be released next week.


"We will comment when it is official," the source told AFP.


"Independence under international supervision is the only viable
option" for Kosovo, Ahtisaari said in the report sent to UN
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon last week, according to the
newspaper.


The council is to receive the final copy of the report on Monday.


Serbia's sometime ally Russia, which has the right of veto in the
Security Council, warned overnight that any discussion of the
province's "outright independence" would be premature.


Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since mid-1999, after a
three-month NATO bombing campaign helped to drive out Serb forces
carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians, who took up
arms for independence.
