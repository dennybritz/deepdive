European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said Tuesday
his officials had been "doing the utmost" to secure the release
of BBC reporter Alan Johnston who was kidnapped last week in
Gaza.


His comments in an interview with BBC television came the day
after the British broadcaster said it was "increasingly
concerned" for Johnston and called for a redoubling of efforts to
find him.


"I can tell you that, from the very first day, we have been doing
the utmost, talking to all the leaders, from the Palestinians and
to some friends (and in) civil society that I know and he knew,
and to try and see if we can liberate him -- the sooner, the
better," Solana told BBC television.


"I don't have any specific information to be made public now. But
the other thing I would like to insist on once again is that we
are concerned, that we keep on doing all our efforts every day."


The 44-year-old was kidnapped in Gaza City at gunpoint on March
12 as he drove home from work.


The EU's influence in the area stems from its role as the biggest
foreign aid donor to the Palestinian Authority.


Last year, the European bloc joined other members of the Middle
East Quartet -- including the United States, the United Nations
and Russia -- in imposing an aid and diplomatic embargo after
Hamas's election victory.


But the EU has found ways of continuing to give aid while
bypassing Hamas, which it insists must renounce violence and
recognize Israel before normal aid supplies can resume.
