Britain has banned its armed forces from using "dumb" cluster
bombs to cut the number of civilians killed and maimed by them,
the Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday.


In future, British troops will only be allowed to use "smart"
cluster bombs with features such as self-destruct mechanisms if
they fail to explode on initial impact.


Charities such as Oxfam and Amnesty International have long
argued for a ban on cluster bombs -- devices containing hundreds
of small bomblets which disperse over a large area -- because
they can leave a deadly legacy for years after the end of
conflicts.


"It is our duty to make sure our forces have the equipment they
need to do the job we ask of them," Defence Secretary Des Browne
told parliament in a written statement.


"At the same time, we should strive to reduce civilian casualties
to the minimum. Military commanders are first to point out that
modern conflicts are in large part about winning hearts and
minds."


Browne added that he hoped other countries would now follow
Britain's lead.


The Ministry of Defence predicted that it would lead to the
destruction of 28 million of the tiny munitions.


At a conference in Norway last month, 46 countries pledged to
seek a treaty banning cluster bombs by next year, with France and
Britain among the nations which signed up.


Japan, Poland and Romania refused to sign the accord, while
Israel and the United States did not take part in the conference.


Belgium banned the use of cluster munitions last year.
