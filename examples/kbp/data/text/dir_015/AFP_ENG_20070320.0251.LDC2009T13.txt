The European Commission will ask Europe's top court Wednesday to
order Poland to suspend work on a road through an ecologically
fragile part of the country's northwest, a spokeswoman said.


"We are going to ask for interim measures," from the European
Court of Justice, environmental affairs spokeswoman Barbara
Helfferich said Tuesday.


The Commission, the EU's executive arm, warned late last month
that it would seek an injunction at the Luxembourg-based court if
Poland refused to halt construction of the so-called Via Baltica
road corridor.


It said the stretch of highway -- to ease the traffic burden on
the nearby town of Augustow as road trade increases between
eastern and western Europe -- would plough through one of the
regions's best-preserved forests.
