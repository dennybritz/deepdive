Insurgents detonated an explosives-rigged vehicle with two
children in the back seat after US soldiers let it through
checkpoint in Baghdad over the weekend, a senior US military
official said Tuesday.


The vehicle was stopped at the checkpoint but was allowed through
when soldiers saw the children in the back, said Major General
Michael Barbero of the joint staff.


"Children in the backseat lowered suspicion. We let it move
through. They parked the vehicle, and the adults run out and
detonated it with the children in the back," said Major General
Michael Barbero.


Barbero said it was the first time he had seen a report of
insurgents using children in suicide bombings, calling it a new
tactic.


The general did not know what date the attack occurred, or have
other details of the car bombing.


"The brutality and the ruthlessness of this enemy hasn't
changed," he said. "They are just interested in slaughtering
Iraqi civilians to be very honest."
