A suspected Muslim militant married in Indonesian police custody
on Tuesday following his arrest last month for allegedly killing
Christians.


Ardin, also known as Rojak, has been accused of attacking
Christians on the island of Sulawesi, including bomb attacks in
2005 that killed 22 people and a shooting at a church in 2004
that wounded two.


The 36-year-old suspect married 19-year-old Yunita Sari at a
mosque in the police headquarters in Palu, the capital of Central
Sulawesi province.


Ardin walked with the aid of two sticks and returned to his cell
under heavy guard straight after the wedding. He was shot several
times during his arrest in February.


"I admit, I made mistakes in the past," he told journalists after
the ceremony, though he declined to elaborate. He also thanked
the police for allowing him to marry.


Relatives, other inmates, including people arrested on suspicion
of involvement in religious violence, and several detectives
attended the wedding.


Ardin was shot in the shoulder, arms and one leg in the February
police raid in Poso on Sulawesi. Another suspected militant,
Basri, also blamed for sectarian violence, was arrested with him.


Poso became a focal point of communal violence between Muslims
and Christians that claimed about 1,000 lives in 2000-2001.


Sporadic unrest has persisted since then, including the
decapitation of three Christian schoolgirls whose heads were left
near a police post and a church in the district.
