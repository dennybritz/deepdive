Residents were evacuated on Tuesday after building workers in
northwestern Poland discovered an unexploded incendiary bomb left
over from World War II, police said.


The bomb, estimated to weigh one tonne, was found at a
construction site in a residential district of the port city of
Szczecin, near the border with Germany, police spokeswoman Irena
Kornicz told AFP.


"It was probably dropped by the Allies. It didn't explode because
it landed in muddy ground," Kornicz said.


Around 30 residents were evacuated from nearby homes as bomb
disposal experts prepared to move the device by truck to a
military base where it was to be destroyed.


Szczecin was formerly part of Germany, when it was known as
Stettin.


During the war it was a major centre for Nazi Germany's arms
industry, and was largely destroyed by Allied air raids and
fighting between German and Soviet troops.


The city was awarded to Poland in 1945.
