US President George W. Bush will call on lawmakers Tuesday to
approve energy legislation by the start of the US summer driving
season that typically opens May 31, the White House said.


The president, who has assailed US dependency on oil from the
Middle East, will make the appeal in a speech at a Ford factory
here that makes several hybrid gas/electric models, said
spokesman Scott Stanzel.


Bush has proposed setting mandatory fuel requirements that would
result in quintupling the current consumption of renewable and
alternative fuels to 35 billion gallons (133 billion liters) by
2017.


He has also said fuel economy standards for cars need to be
tightened to reduce gasoline consumption.


"By taking these steps, we can help achieve a great goal:
reducing the use of gasoline in the United States by 20 percent
in the next 10 years, and cutting our total imports by the
equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from
the Middle East," Bush said in January.
