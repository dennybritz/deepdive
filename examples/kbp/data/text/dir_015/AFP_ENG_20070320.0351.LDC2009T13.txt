Nicaragua and Cuba have renewed normal diplomatic relations after
17 years of strain following the January election of leftist
President Daniel Ortega.


Cuban ambassador Luis Hernandez presented his credentials on
Monday, Nicaragua's foreign ministry said.


Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel Santos told Hernandez that
Ortega's government would "strengthen the ties of friendship and
cooperation between the two peoples and nations," according to a
statement from the foreign ministry.


Bilateral relations were lowered to the charge d'affaires level
for the 17 years that conservative leaders governed the Central
American country, but were raised January 10 after former
revolutionary Ortega took office.


Nicaragua has named its ambassador to Cuba, Luis Cabrera,
formerly the representative of the Sandinista National Liberation
Front (FSLN) in Havana.


FSLN overthrew Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979,
leaving Ortega in charge. He was elected in 1984 and took power
in 1985, but lost a second bid.


As a leftist guerrilla group, FSLN received assistance from Cuba,
the only Communist country in the hemisphere.
