Germany's Commerzbank said Tuesday it was selling its British
asset management unit Jupiter to a consortium comprised of
Jupiter's own management and US financial investor TA Associates
for more than one billion euros.


The 740-million pound (1.1-billion-euro, 1.4-billion-dollar)
sale, which is expected to close in July, would produce a book
gain of about 300 million euros.


Commerzbank is continuing to pursue its strategy of focusing on
its core markets and has decided a management buyout is the best
option for all parties involved, board member Achim Kassow said
in a statement.


Jupiter currently manages about 19.2 billion pounds in funds,
Commerzbank said.


Commerzbank has long been looking to sell Jupiter, either via a
straightforward divestment or by floating it on the stock market.


The Frankfurt-based bank acquired Jupiter in 1995 when it bought
a stake of 75 percent for around 200 million euros.


It subsequently acquired the other 25 percent for an undisclosed
amount, but the subsidiary has seen its value decline in recent
years.
