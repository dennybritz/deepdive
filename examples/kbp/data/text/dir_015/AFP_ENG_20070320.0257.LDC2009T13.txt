Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday criticised North
Korea for refusing to attend six-party talks in Beijing until
millions of dollars in frozen assets is returned.


"As long as North Koreans continue taking this kind of attitude,
their situation will not change," Abe told reporters.


"Unless North Korea carries out the six-nation agreement for
sure, it wouldn't achieve what it could have, either," he said.


"It needs to realise the country will be neither accepted by the
international community nor able to change their difficult
situation."


The US Treasury had announced Monday that about 25 million
dollars in North Korean funds frozen in a Macau bank could be
released, although no timeframe was given.


Envoys for the Stalinist regime said they would not make any
further moves at the disarmament talks until the money has been
transferred into one of its bank accounts, according to a
Japanese negotiator.


It forced the host country China to postpone Tuesday's scheduled
session, although the chief North Korean and US negotiators did
meet bilaterally.
