A former Iranian ambassador to Jordan wanted in the United States
for allegedly plotting to sell military equipment faces another
day in a British court in April after his extradition hearing was
adjourned Tuesday.


Nosratollah Tajik, 53, was at City of Westminster Magistrates
Court in London for a procedural hearing over US claims that he
tried to supply night-vision weapons sights to Iran, which is
under an arms embargo.


"He's on bail and he will be attending this court again on April
19," a court official told AFP.


"It's just been put over and hopefully there will be a decision
then."


Tajik was arrested by British detectives at his home in Durham,
north-east England, last October.


He is an honorary fellow of Durham University's Institute for
Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies.


At a previous hearing in January, Tajik's wife, Mahboubeh
Sadghi'nia, said she was concerned for his health and said he had
suffered chest pains and depression due to stress caused by the
allegations.
