A Moroccan implicated in the 2003 Casablanca suicide bombings
that killed 45 people was indicted on Tuesday, his lawyer told
AFP.


Saad Houssaini, nicknamed the "chemist" by the Moroccan press for
his alleged bomb-making skills, was questioned by investigating
magistrate Najim ben Sami in the anti-terrorism tribunal at Sale,
near Rabat.


The 44-year old was indicted for "creating a criminal gang with
the goal of preparing and committing terrorist acts aimed at
disrupting public order".


He was also charged with "carrying out activities within an
unrecognised association" and holding "public meetings without
authorisation."


"I was present at the interrogation," Houssaini's lawyer
Abdelfettah Zahrach told AFP, adding that "the investigating
magistrate acted in a proper way towards my client."


Houssaini, who was arrested earlier this month, has already been
sentenced in absentia to 20 years behind bars for the 2003
attacks.


Forty-five people were killed in the blasts, including 12 suicide
bombers, and dozens were injured.


The authorities believe Houssaini is a leading member of the
Moroccan Islamic Combat Group (GICM), which has links to Al-Qaeda
and is also suspected of involvement in the Madrid train bombings
in 2004.


Three days after Houssaini's arrest on March 8, a suicide blast
rocked a Casablanca cybercafe, killing the bomber and injuring
four people, including the bomber's suspected accomplice.
