The World Bank is to manage a new  50-million-euro (66-million-
dollar) European fund to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
emerging economies, it said Tuesday.


The fund, which will also rely on expertise from the European
Investment Bank, is backed by the governments of Ireland,
Luxembourg, Portugal, the Belgian region of Flanders as well as
Norwegian power company Statkraft.


In exchange for spending on emissions-reducing projects in
emerging economies, the investors will receive so-called carbon
credits as foreseen by the Kyoto Protocol.


These credits can then either be sold on the European emissions
trading market for a financial gain or be used against the
investing countries' targets under the Kyoto Protocol for
reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.


Under the Kyoto agreement, the EU is to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by eight percent from 1990 levels by 2012.


The World Bank already manages 10 similar funds with a total
value of more than two billion dollars.
