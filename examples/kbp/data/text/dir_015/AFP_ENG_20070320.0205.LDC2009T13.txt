The Afghan government admitted Tuesday to freeing some Taliban
prisoners in exchange for the release of an Italian hostage,
saying it was an "exceptional measure" that would not be
repeated.


The Taliban freed Daniele Mastrogiacomo on Monday after capturing
him in the southern province of Helmand on March 4, along with an
Afghan translator and a driver. The driver was beheaded and the
fate of the translator is unclear.


"They had some demands and their demands to some extent were
accepted," presidential spokesman Karim Rahimi told reporters.


Asked if he could confirm some Taliban were exchanged for the
reporter, he replied: "Yes." He did not say how many.
