Dozens of soldiers and UN armoured vehicles were deployed outside
the residence of ex-vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba in the
capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo Tuesday amid fears of
clashes with his security guards.


Witnesses said that three shots had been heard although it was
unclear if they had come from troops with the DRC armed forces
(FARDC) or from guards on security detail for Bemba, who is also
a former rebel leader.


The UN mission to the Congo (MONUC) said it was worried that an
isolated incident between soldiers could spark trouble.


The situation in the Gombe district has been tense since Thursday
when all soldiers still serving the two transitional regime vice
presidents were ordered back to barracks.


But Bemba and Azarias Ruberwa, whose rebel movements battled
Kinshasa until 2003, oppose the move, arguing that a guard of 12
police officers assigned to them by a presidential decree is
insufficient.


Both men became vice-presidents during a post-war transition to
democratic rule overseen by the United Nations and have since
been reluctant to give up their own personal guard details.


Bemba's soldiers were involved in bloodshed in the capital three
times last year at the height of the transition process.


The DRC's political transition process ended last year with the
vast central African nation's first democratic elections in more
than four decades, leading to Joseph Kabila being inaugurated as
president in December.
