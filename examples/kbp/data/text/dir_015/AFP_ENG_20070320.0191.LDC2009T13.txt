EU regulators took the first step on Tuesday in legal action
against a suspected cartel of professional videotape makers, the
latest push in a wider drive against the illegal clubs.


The European Commission said it had sent formal charge-sheets to
the unnamed companies, accusing them of "restricting competition"
in the market for videotape used for filming movies and
television programmes.


The EU's competition watchdog said that the action followed
inspections in 2002, an investigation and a tip-off.


Under EU rules, the companies now have two months to defend
themselves in writing against the accusations lodged against
them.


If regulators are not satisfied with the answers, they can slap
fines of up to 10 percent of the companies' worldwide annual
revenue.


EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has made waging a "no-
tolerance" crackdown on cartels a top priority and has lodged
ever-rising record fines against the illegal clubs.


Most recently, the Dutch competition commissioner imposed the
biggest fine ever in a EU cartel case by bringing an illegal club
of lift makers crashing down in February with a penalty of 992
million euros (1.3 billion dollars).


Last week, her team of trust-busters also launched legal action
against a suspected cartel of class makers by sending out formal
charge-sheets accusing them of price fixing.
