About 730,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the beginning of
2006 and are facing increasing hardship inside Iraq, the UN
refugee agency said on Tuesday.


Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said that most of the
displaced were now hemmed inside the conflict- riven country.


"Reaching help and safety in neighbouring countries is becoming
increasingly difficult," Redmond told journalists.


"Many of those who have fled to other parts of Iraq have run out
of resources and host communities are also struggling to absorb
increasing numbers of displaced," he added.


The UNHCR estimates that up to 50,000 people are fleeing their
homes every month.


An estimated 4.0 million people in Iraq are dependent on food
assistance, while the rate of chronic malnutrition among children
is 23 percent, Redmond said.


Some 2.0 million Iraqis are now in neighbouring countries -- many
of them since before Saddam Hussein was toppled, according to the
UNHCR. Another 1.9 million are estimated to be displaced within
the country.


"While many were displaced before 2003, we estimate that just
since the beginning of last year, and particularly since the
Samara bombing in 2006, nearly 730,000 Iraqis have become newly
displaced by sectarian violence," said Redmond.


The UNHCR is organising an international conference in Geneva on
April 17 to 18 to examine how to deal with the biggest wave of
displacement in the Middle East since 1948.
