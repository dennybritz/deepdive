Disgraced Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, who was suspended for
two years after failing a drugs test at the 2006 Turin Olympics,
will return to the national team when her ban expires next year,
national coach Valery Polkhovsky said Tuesday.


Pyleva had initially announced that she was quitting the sport
after testing positive for the banned substance carphedon and
being stripped of the silver medal she won in the women's 15km
race in Turin.


Polkhovsky added that veterans Albina Akhatova and Olga Zaitseva
would also return to the national squad following maternity
leave.


"Olga (Pyleva) is seriously set to return after serving the ban.
It's a matter of principle for her," said Polkhovsky.


"I also talked to Albina (Akhatova) and Zaitseva," the coach
added. "They are both set to continue competing next season. I'm
counting on them all."
