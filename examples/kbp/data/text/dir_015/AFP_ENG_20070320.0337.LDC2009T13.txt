Hollywood actress Uma Thurman has split up with New York hotelier
Andre Balazs after more than three years together, the star's
publicist confirmed Tuesday.


The 36-year-old star of the "Kill Bill" series and "Pulp Fiction"
split up with Balazs last week, publicist Robert Garlock said,
adding that the pair did not want to release any further details.


Thurman, who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in
"Pulp Fiction," was previously married to actors Gary Oldman and
Ethan Hawke, with whom she has two children.
