A New Delhi court convicted a school teacher for parading a
student from a low caste family naked in front of his peers for
three hours nearly a decade ago, a report said Tuesday.


P.C. Gupta, who was the vice-principal of a government school in
the capital New Delhi in 1997, was charged with dishonouring the
dignity of a person, causing injury, criminal intimidation and
the use of criminal force, the Times of India reported.


Criminal cases have been known to take decades in India's clogged
judicial system due to a shortage of judges and a mammoth backlog
of cases.


Sentencing, for what the newspaper said was a rare conviction of
a teacher for punishment of a child, will be handed out on
Monday.


The pupil was humiliated and chided for being a sweeper's son, a
low-caste job in the Hindu religion, because he took a dip in the
school water tank on a summer afternoon while the school was in
session, the report said.


The boy dropped out of school after the abuse and now works as a
factory mechanic.
