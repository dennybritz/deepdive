A roadside bomb killed two US soldiers in Baghdad when their
vehicle was targeted during a combat patrol in a southern
district of the capital, the military said Tuesday.


It did not specify when the incident occurred.


The latest deaths brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 20 invasion exactly four years back to 3,222, according
to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
