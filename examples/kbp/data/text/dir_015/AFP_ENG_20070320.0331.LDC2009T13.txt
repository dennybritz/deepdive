Iraqi security forces killed 39 "terrorists" in a fierce battle
in the western Sunni province of Al-Anbar on Tuesday, a top Iraqi
official told AFP.


Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf, director of the operations
centre in the interior ministry, said seven other militants were
arrested, including some Arab nationals.


The clashes broke out early Tuesday in Ameriyah, southwest of the
former rebel town of Fallujah and the site of a recent chlorine
gas attack.


Khalaf said security forces supported by paramilitary units
formed by Sunni tribes fought the militants in a battle that
lasted several hours. Two top militants, Shakir Hadi Jassim and
Mohammed Khamis, were among the dead.


About 25 Sunni tribes from Anbar have formed an coalition --
Anbar Awakening -- to take on the militants, largely from the Al-
Qaeda network, who are operating in the western province.


These tribes have been sending thousands of young men to join the
government security forces or their paramilitary units to
cooperate with US and Iraqi commanders to fight insurgents.


In response, the insurgents have launched attacks on them and
modified their tactics to add gas bombs to their arsenal.


On Friday, bombers detonated three dirty bombs in Anbar province
poisoning 350 civilians, six American soldiers and killing two
policemen.
