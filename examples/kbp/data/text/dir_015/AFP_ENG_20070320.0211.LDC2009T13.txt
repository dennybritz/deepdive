European Union and US officials met face-to-face at the World
Trade Organisation on Tuesday to discuss their long-running
subsidies dispute over airline manufacturers Airbus and Boeing,
sources close to the affair said.


The US and the EU launched reciprocal complaints at the WTO over
subsidies to the world's two biggest civil aircraft makers in
October 2004.


The US case has targeted government loans to Airbus for the
launch of new models while the EU has challenged assistance
accorded to Boeing by US state governments as well as the US
Defense Department and the space agency NASA.


Tuesday's first session of the WTO's special dispute settlement
panel was looking at the US complaint intially, the sources said.


The hearing will continue its session on Tuesday.


In a break from the normal practice of confidentiality, the
session was set to be made public by video broadcast on Thursday
-- but only after Airbus and Boeing representatives have reviewed
the tapes to ensure they do not contain confidential business
information.


The EU's complaint against alleged US assistance to Boeing is set
to come before the panel on July 11. A ruling is expected in
February 2008.
