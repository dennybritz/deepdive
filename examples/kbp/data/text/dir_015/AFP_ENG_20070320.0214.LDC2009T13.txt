An elderly Serb man failed a driving test despite having spent 45
years behind the wheel during which he travelled to several
European countries, a report said Tuesday.


Since 1962, Blogoje Neskovic, 75, had driven unrestricted on the
roads of Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania in spite of never
having had a driving licence, said the Politika newspaper.


"I tried to pass the licence test, I even took courses, but I
failed," said Neskovic, a resident of the village of Lozanj,
around 110 kilometres (70 miles) south of the capital Belgrade.


The pensioner said, however, that he retained pride in the fact
that he had never been stopped by police for having made any
traffic violations, a feat which he felt was deserving of an
"honorary licence."
