A senior United States official met on Tuesday for the first time
with a member of the new Palestinian unity cabinet, holding talks
with finance minister Salam Fayyad, officials said.


Jacob Walles, the American consul in Jerusalem, met with Fayyad
in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian officials told AFP
on condition of anonymity.


It marked the first time that a senior US official meets with a
minister from the new Palestinian coalition cabinet, led by the
Islamist movement of Hamas, considered a terror group in the
West.


A spokeswoman for the consulate declined to comment on the
reported meeting with Fayyad, who is neither a member of Hamas
nor of its rival, the Fatah party of moderate Palestinian
president Mahmud Abbas.
