Argentine striker Maxi Rodriguez and Bulgarian midfielder Martin
Petrov should play again this season despite suffering serious
knee injuries, Atletico Madrid's doctor said Tuesday.


Both players suffered knee ligament injuries in October and
underwent surgery shortly afterwards.


"We are still in the five months after the operation. And yet
they are running, kicking the ball, overall their recuperation is
very pleasing," said Jose Maria Villalon, Atletico's medical
services chief.


"If they continue to progress as they have, it's possible that
both will play several matches this season, even if we're being
prudent."
