China has no ambition to overtake the United States and become
the world's sporting superpower at next year's Beijing Olympics,
organising committee president Liu Qi said here Tuesday.


"Frankly, China's sports development is quite fast but our
ambition is not to top the gold medal standings at the Beijing
Olympics," Liu said during a meeting here with AFP chairman
Pierre Louette.


"After all it's competing, not the results that count."


Beijing was far more interested in using the Olympics to showcase
China's rich culture and civilisation and promote an image of
economic and social development.


"We want to show that China is a country rich in history and
civilisation," he said. "We also want the whole world to see the
economic and social progress of China."


China finished second in the medal standings at the Athens Games
in 2004 -- its best ever performance at an Olympics -- winning 32
golds to 35 for the United States.


"We have carefully researched our performance at Athens and at
the previous games in Sydney (in 2000) and I think we can keep
the same standards in 2008 although it would be good to do
better," said Liu, who is also a member of the politburo of
China's Communist Party and head of the Beijing party.


However, he said that the Chinese are not interested in toppling
the United States by coming first at the Beijing Games.


"Foreigners often ask whether that is our ambition, but we don't
even talk about it in China," he said.


AFP chairman Louette is on a week-long visit to Beijing to review
preparations for the Beijing Games.
