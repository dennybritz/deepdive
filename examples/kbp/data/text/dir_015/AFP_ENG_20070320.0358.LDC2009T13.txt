Germany striker Miroslav Klose is still undecided about where his
future lies, his agent said Tuesday.


The 28-year-old has been at Werder Bremen since 2004 and finished
top scorer at last year's World Cup.


He is one of football's hottest properties in Europe and has been
trailed by many of the continent's top clubs.


"Miro thought he would have decided by now. He says himself that
it's a difficult decision to take," said agent Alexander Schutt.


Klose is under contract with the German title challengers until
2008 but had previously told them he would have come to a
decision by the beginning of 2007.


Bremen are desperate to keep him and have been patient as he
makes up his mind.


"There's no pressure or time restraints," added Schutt.


But with the likes of Juventus and Bayern Munich waiting in the
wings, Werder are getting nervous.


"He is attracting lots of interest," admitted Bremen's sporting
director Klaus Allofs, before adding: "He feels very good here."


However Schutt said that is not enough on its own to convince
Klose to stay.


Another worry for club and player is Klose's current form - he
has not scored in the league since the end of January and has
just 11 goals this season.


The Polish born player, who has scored 33 goals in 67 appearances
for the national team, is also suspended for Germany's next Euro
2008 qualifier against the Czech Republic in Prague on Saturday.
