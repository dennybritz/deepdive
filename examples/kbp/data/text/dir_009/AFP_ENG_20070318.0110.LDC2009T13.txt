Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal secured his first World Cup overall
crown after a thrilling finale to the alpine skiing season here
Sunday.


Svindal went into the race with a 97-point lead on Austrian rival
and holder Benjamin Raich and needing to finish in at least 15th
place to secure his first crown.


Raich pushed Svindal all the way by winning Sunday's slalom in
defiant style ahead of compatriot Mario Matt and Italian Manfred
Moelgg.


However Svindal, who won three races in a row over the past week,
finally finished in 15th meaning he was able to add the
competition's prestigious crystal globe to the two world titles
he won in the downhill and giant slalom last month.


It means Svindal finished 13 points ahead of Raich in the overall
World Cup standings.


Raich, the double Olympic champion, was consolidated by securing
the World Cup slalom crown ahead of Matt and Swedish sensation
Jens Byggmark.
