Most Spaniards want to see the government renew talks with the
militant Basque separatist group ETA despite the deadly attack it
launched last December, a poll released Sunday suggested.


Fifty-nine percent believed dialogue should be reopened despite
the bombing at Madrid's international airport, in which two
people were killed.


The poll also showed that 65 percent of respondents did not
believe that ETA was willing to renounce violence.


The poll of 1,500 people was carried out by the Gesop Institute
between March 11 and 15 for the Spanish daily El Periodico.


The airport attack led socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero to break off all contact with the militants,
although ETA claimed at the time that it had not breached the
ceasefire it announced in March 2006.


A spokesman said at the time that the bomb had not been intended
to kill.


The Basque separatist movement is blamed for 819 deaths in its
38-year campaign to win independence for the region.


Zapatero has said he has no intention of reopening dialogue under
the current circumstances.
