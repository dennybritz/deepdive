The founder of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (SGPC)
and one of its regional leaders have been sentenced to death in
absentia, the Algerian press said on Sunday.


Hassan Hattab, who created the SGPC but has since been expelled,
and Mokhtar Belmokhtar, who leads the southern Saharan branch of
the Al-Qaeda-linked group, were sentenced on Saturday by a court
in Batna, eastern Algeria.


They were charged with setting up armed terrorist groups, attacks
against the state, premeditated murder, arson, theft and
possession of banned weapons.


Hattab opposed the SGPC's recent decision to become the Maghreb
branch of Al- Qaeda and the Algerian authorities said he now
wanted to surrender to profit from last year's national peace
charter, which pardons Islamists who disarm.


Belmokhtar leads a small armed group, which according to the
Algerian authorities work with smugglers who attack oil workers
and truck drivers crossing the desert to Mali and sub-Saharan
Africa.


Police denied reports in the Algerian press that he had died.
