US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Sunday it was too soon
to know whether the recent "surge" of thousands of additional US
troops in Iraq is quelling rampant sectarian violence.


"I think that the way I would characterize it is, so far so
good," said Gates, adding however that "it's very early" to make
a more definitive assessment.


"General (David) Petraeus, the commander out there, has said that
it will probably be summer before we know whether we're being
successful or not," the defense secretary told CBS television's
"Face the Nation" program.


Gates added that he is also generally happy with how Iraqi forces
are performing since the United States began deploying over
25,000 more US troops in Iraq.


In a new strategy declared by President George W. Bush in
January, the US began boosting troop numbers to restore security
in violence-wracked Baghdad and Al- Anbar province.


"I would say that the Iraqis are meeting the commitments that
they have made to us, that they have made the appointments, the
troops that they have promised are showing up," Gates said.


"We're basically buying them time," Gates said.


"That's the whole purpose of this strategy. And they are going to
have to step up to the plate and we can help them by giving them
the time to do that, and to make their military forces able to
carry the burden by themselves," the defense secretary said.
