Three people have died in a house fire at the Royal Air Force
base of Akrotiri near the southern Cyprus coastal town of
Limassol, a British military spokesman said on Sunday.


"There has been a fire within a residential street at RAF
Akrotiri -- there are three fatalities," British Forces Cyprus
spokesman Captain Crispin Coates told AFP.


Those killed in Saturday night's blaze have yet to be formally
identified, he added.


Cyprus state radio said the victims were a man and his two young
sons. This could not be confirmed by the British military,
although one source said they were related to British military
personnel.


"The special investigation branch is investigating the causes of
the fire along with the defence and fire rescue services," Coates
said.


Britain has maintained two sovereign base areas on the island
since Cyprus independence in 1960, and RAF Akrotiri is the
largest British air base outside the UK.


Some 10,000 British troops and their families are stationed on
the strategic island, which Britain uses as a key logistics hub
for operations in the Middle East. Cyprus is also an important
listening and surveillance post.
