Cesare Battisti, a former Italian revolutionary who went into
hiding in France two and a half years ago, was arrested Sunday in
Brazil, French justice officials said.


Battisti, 52, disappeared in August 2004, shortly before the
French government signed an extradition order to return him to
Italy, where he has been convicted in absentia for four murders.


A former member of the Armed Proletarians for Communism, Battisti
lived in Paris from 1990 and made his name as a crime writer.
