Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Sunday the island's top
China policy- maker Joseph Wu has been named de facto envoy to
the United States.


Wu, who currently heads the Mainland Affairs Council, would take
over from David Lee, who would be reassigned to Canada, Su told
reporters.


Wu would also be the first member of the independence-leaning
Democratic Progressive Party to serve as representative to the
US, as his predecessors were from the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT).


Taiwan's Liberty Times said Wu would play a key role in
stabilising ties between Taipei and Washington in the runup to
presidential elections in 2008.


The newspaper said Wu was expected to assume the post no later
than April.


Washington earlier this month called Taiwanese President Chen
Shui-bian's pledge to push for independence "unhelpful" and
reiterated its stance against independence for the island.


Chen pledged, in his inaugural speech in 2000, that he would not
declare independence nor change Taiwan's name or seek a
referendum on independence.


Nevertheless, he has called for Taiwan to overhaul its
constitution, which was enacted by then ruling KMT in China in
1947 and has gone through seven amendments here since 1991.


Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979,
but remains the leading arms supplier to Taiwan.
