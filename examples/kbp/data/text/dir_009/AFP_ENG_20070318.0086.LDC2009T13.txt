Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo has been freed in
Afghanistan after two weeks in captivity, Italian media reported
Sunday.


The Italian news agency ANSA reported from Kabul that Taliban
spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi gave the news by telephone that the
veteran 52-year-old journalist for La Repubblica had been freed.


A La Repubblica employee earlier told AFP that the newspaper had
"learned that the journalist has been freed," but deputy editor
Mauro Bene later said it did not have confirmation.


The Italian foreign ministry could not confirm the report,
spokesman Pasquale Ferrara telling AFP: "We'll consider him free
when he's safely in Italian hands."


Ahmadi told AFP that Monday evening was the deadline for its
demands to be met, including a date for the withdrawal of Italian
troops and the release of two Taliban spokesmen being held by
authorities.


The Taliban initially said the Italian and his colleagues had
been spying for military forces in Afghanistan.


Mastrogiacomo's newspaper and various media groups have also
appealed for the Italian's release, stressing he is an
established reporter who has covered events around the world.
