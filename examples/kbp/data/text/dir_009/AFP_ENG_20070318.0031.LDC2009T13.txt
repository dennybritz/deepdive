Sri Lanka's navy on Sunday sank a cargo vessel believed to be
smuggling weapons for Tamil Tiger rebels, the defence ministry
said.


Sri Lankan naval craft shelled the ship after it failed to stop
for an inspection and opened fire on the navy, the ministry said
in a statement.


"The details provided by the ship in respect to its registration
and other details were false," the statement said. "The vessel
carried no flag or mark of identification."


After firing warning shots across the bows the navy shelled the
ship, which exploded and sank off the island's eastern coast of
Arugam Bay, the ministry said.


"The naval ships observed huge explosions onboard the vessel,
confirming that it was carrying a huge amount of explosives and
war-like material to the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam)," the ministry said.


There was no immediate word from the Tamil Tigers.


The navy carried out a similar attack on February 28 and sank an
identical craft off the island's southern coast, according to
defence authorities here.


There have been stepped up clashes between suspected Tamil Tiger
ships and the Sri Lankan navy in recent months amid heavy
fighting in the island's northern and eastern regions.
