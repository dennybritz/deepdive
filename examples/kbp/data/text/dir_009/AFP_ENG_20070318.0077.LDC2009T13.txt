Seven more US soldiers have died in Iraq, six of them in separate
bomb attacks in and around Baghdad, the military said on Sunday.


Four soldiers died and one was wounded when their unit was struck
by a roadside bomb while on patrol in west Baghdad on Saturday,
the military said in a statement.


Another soldier was wounded when the unit came under small arms
fire after the blast.


In another incident on Saturday, one soldier was killed and three
wounded while they were on foot patrol in south Baghdad.


One more soldier died the same day from injuries sustained in an
explosion in the restive Diyala province, north of Baghdad. Five
other soldiers were also wounded in the blast, the military said.


A Task Force Lightning soldier also died on Saturday in a non-
combat related incident in Tikrit, 180 kilometres (110 miles)
north of Baghdad, it said, without elaborating.


The latest deaths brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,219, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
