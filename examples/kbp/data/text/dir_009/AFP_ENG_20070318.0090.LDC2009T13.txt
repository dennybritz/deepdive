Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said Sunday
that the crisis- hit country was at a "tipping point", in a
telephone interview with BBC television.


Questioned about whether Zimbabwe was on the edge of a "moment of
liberation," Tsvangirai responded:


"I think that this is a tipping point. Things are bad but I think
this crisis has reached a tipping point and we could be seeing
the beginning of the end of this dictatorship."


Turning to his recent head injuries sustained at the hands of
President Robert Mugabe's security services, he added: "My
physical condition is greatly improved. I am recovering."


Tsvangirai left hospital in a wheelchair last Friday after being
told by doctors he was out of danger and had suffered no brain
damage, after being arrested for trying to attend a banned
demonstration one week ago on Sunday.


Images of a badly beaten Tsvangirai and his supporters triggered
worldwide condemnation, particularly from Mugabe's arch foes in
London and Washington.
