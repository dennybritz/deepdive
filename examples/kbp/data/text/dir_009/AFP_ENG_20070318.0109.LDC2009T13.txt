At least five people are missing after two apartment buildings
collapsed in a working class district of the northern Syrian city
of Aleppo, police said Sunday.


"At least five people have been reported missing and a number of
people have been injured after the two buildings collapsed in
Butan al-Basha (on Saturday)," police officer Khatib al-Khatib
told AFP.


Rescuers were combing through the rubble on Sunday to try to find
people who may still be trapped, he added.
