Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called Sunday for the
international community to maintain a year-long boycott of the
Palestinian government following the formation of a new unity
cabinet.


"We expect the international community not to fall for the new
Palestinian unity government and to continue with the same line
it has taken all along, the way of isolating the government which
does not accept the Quartet principles," Olmert said at the
opening of his weekly cabinet meeting.


The Quartet of Middle East peace mediators -- the United States,
European Union, Unitted Nations and Russia -- froze aid to the
Palestinian Authority after Hamas came to power last year over
the Islamists' refusal to renounce violence, recognise Israel, or
abide past peace accords.


The new Palestinian government unites Hamas and the Fatah faction
of moderate president Mahmud Abbas.
