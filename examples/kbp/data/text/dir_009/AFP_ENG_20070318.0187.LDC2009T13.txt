Insurgents set off a car bomb in a popular market in Baghdad's
mainly Shiite district of Shaab on Sunday, killing three people
and wounding seven more, a security official said.


The bombing struck the well-known Shallal market the Shiite
stronghold of Sadr City in the northeast of the Iraqi capital.


The official said the toll "could rise as the incident occurred
in a popular market."


The attack came despite a massive security crackdown in Baghdad,
with 90,000 US and Iraqi forces patrolling the streets since
February 14.
