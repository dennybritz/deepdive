Japan is becoming a less and less comfortable place for smokers
after a major railway firm on Sunday imposed a complete ban in
its express trains.


East Japan Railway Co. (JR East), one of the nation's main
railway operators, introduced the ban in its express bullet
trains running in the regions north of Tokyo and on other limited
trains.


Other JR companies, formerly part of now-defunct Japan National
Railways along with JR East, will keep smoking cars in their
express trains operating in the central and western regions.


A customer service representative said the company had received
several complaints about the ban.


"I explained that was the trend of the world," the staffer said.


Japan is widely regarded as a welcoming place for smokers because
of lax legislation and a relatively low tax on tobacco.
