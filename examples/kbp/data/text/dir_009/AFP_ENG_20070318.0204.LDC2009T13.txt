US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Sunday it was too soon
to know whether the recent "surge" of thousands of additional US
forces in Iraq is having an impact on quelling rampant sectarian
violence.


"I think that the way I would characterize it is, so far so
good," said Gates, adding however that "it's very early" to make
a more definitive assessment.


"General (David) Petraeus, the commander out there, has said that
it will probably be summer before we know whether we're being
successful or not," the defense secretary told CBS television's
"Face the Nation" program.


Gates added that he is also generally happy with how Iraqi forces
are performing since the United States began deploying over
25,000 more US troops in Iraq.


"I would say that the Iraqis are meeting the commitments that
they have made to us, that they have made the appointments, the
troops that they have promised are showing up," Gates said.
