An ex-Bangladeshi army officer arrested in the United States for
his role in the 1975 military-backed coup in the south Asian
nation will be deported back home, a minister said Sunday.


Mohiuddin A.K.M. Ahmed, who faces the death penalty in
Bangladesh, "will be deported to Bangladesh very soon," interim
Foreign Minister Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said.


"Both Bangladesh and the United States are cooperating on his
deportation," he said, adding the deportation would be go ahead
even though Bangladesh and the US do not have any extradition
treaty.


Ahmed, 60, was arrested by the US Immigration and Customs
Enforcement's (ICE) fugitive operations department in Los Angeles
earlier this week.


He is wanted in Bangladesh for playing a part in the overthrow
that resulted in the assassination of the country's first
president and founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.


The coup also saw several of the president's aides killed,
although his daughter, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, later became prime
minister of Bangladesh between 1996 and 2001 and leads the Awami
League, which heads a coalition of 19 opposition parties.


In 1998, Ahmed was convicted in absentia by the Bangladesh high
court for his role in the coup and assassination, and sentenced
to death.


The interim foreign minister said at least six other army
officers convicted for their role in the assassination have
absconded and the government does not know their whereabouts.
