Imperial Tobacco on Sunday sought talks with Altadis after the
Franco-Spanish cigarette maker rejected an informal takeover bid
from its British rival.


Altadis had snubbed an 11.5 billion-euro (15.2 billion-dollar)
takeover from Imperial on Saturday.


"We are aware of the decision, we are discussing it, and we are
looking forward to further friendly dialogue," an Imperial
Tobacco spokesman said Sunday.


The Altadis board unanimously rejected the offer in a statement.


The bid "does not reflect the strategic value of the group, nor
its unique and diverse assets, as well as their future growth
prospects," the statement added.


Imperial's offer was made last Thursday, following which the
Spanish business media reported that Altadis has opened
negotiations with the world's leading cigarette maker, Philip
Morris, for a joint counter bid for Imperial.


Furthermore, the Spanish business daily El Economista reported on
Friday that if Philip Morris was not interested, Altadis would
approach British rival BAT to help it buy Imperial.


The move by Imperial comes amid consolidation in the industry as
anti-tobacco legislation begins to bite and tobacco companies
look elsewhere for profits.
