Iraqi forces have arrested an Iraqi-born Palestinian suspected of
acting as a financier for the Al-Qaeda militant network, military
spokesman Brigadier General Qassim Mussawi said on Sunday.


Mussawi said Mahmud Hamed Kamal al-Mathi -- also known as "Abu
Qutada the Palestinian" -- was seized by commandos from the Iraqi
Army's 4th Brigade on Saturday in Bab al-Moadham, a district of
central Baghdad.


In a video of the suspect's interrogation shown to reporters, the
24-year-old bearded militant confirms his arrest and admits he
received money from outside Iraq to fund insurgent attacks.


"We found him with CDs, special evidence and documents related to
the Al-Qaeda network, and in his initial interrogation he
admitted many crimes against the Iraqi people," Mussawi said.


Mathi was born in Iraq to Palestinian refugee parents.
