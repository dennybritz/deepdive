The chief of Israel's Mossad spy agency is to stay in the job
until the end of 2008, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office said
on Sunday.


Meir Dagan, in charge of Israeli intelligence since 2002 and
tasked with monitoring Iran's nuclear drive, said in December
that Tehran would have the bomb in three or four years if its
atomic programme continued at its present pace.


Iran says its nuclear activities are purely peaceful, while
Israel is considered the only albeit undeclared nuclear-armed
power in the Middle East with an estimated 200 warheads.


Dagan, 61, was a political advisor to former premier Ariel Sharon
and anti- terrorism advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu, also a former
prime minister.
