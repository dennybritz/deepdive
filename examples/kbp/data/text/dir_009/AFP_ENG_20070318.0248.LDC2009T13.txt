Montenegro police detained and questioned family members of
indicted Bosnian war crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic, a local
newspaper reported Sunday.


Police questioned Radmila Tomovic, who is Karadzic's sister, as
well as her husband Radan Tomovic and their daughter Ivanka
throughout the day Saturday, the Vijesti newspaper said.


Karadzic's brother, Raca Karadzik, told the paper he believed
they were questioned because his sister recently visited the city
of Pale near Sarajevo. Karadzic's wife and daughter live there.


Police in Niksic, where the questioning took place, refused
comment, the paper said.


Wartime Bosnian Serb political leader Karadzic and his top
general, Ratko Mladic, are wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal
in The Hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity
committed during Bosnia's 1992-1995 conflict.
