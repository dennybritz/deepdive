Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo has been freed in
Afghanistan after two weeks in captivity, his employer La
Repubblica said Sunday.


"We've learned that the journalist was freed," an official at the
left-leaning paper told AFP.


The Italian foreign ministry could not confirm the report,
spokesman Pasquale Ferrara telling AFP: "We'll consider him free
when he's safely in Italian hands."
