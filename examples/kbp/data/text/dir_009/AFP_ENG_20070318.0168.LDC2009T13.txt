Russian Ivan Tcherezov held off newly-crowned World Cup champion
Michael Greis to claim his maiden series victory in the final
biathlon race of the season on Sunday.


Tcherezov clocked a time of 42min 29.7sec after picking up two
penalties at the shooting range, finishing ahead of Greis and his
fellow German Sven Fischer.


Norwegian biathlon giant Ole Einar Bjoerndalen finished in fourth
place to claim second place behind Greis in the overall World Cup
standings.


Frenchman Raphael Poiree finished third overall having retired
from the sport after last weekend's competition in Holmenkollen,
Norway.
