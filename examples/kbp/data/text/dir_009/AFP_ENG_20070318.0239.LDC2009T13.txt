Ajax blew the Dutch title race wide open with a stunning 5-1 win
at leaders PSV Eindhoven on Sunday.


Klas-Jan Huntelaar was the chief architect of PSV's downfall,
scoring twice as the visitors' clever counter-attacking play
exposed their hosts' weaknesses.


The victory moves Ajax onto 62 points, just five behind the
leaders and with AZ Alkmaar, who drew 0-0 at Heracles, on 60
there is a real title race on the cards.


A few weeks ago PSV had looked to be disappearing over the hill
but a poor run of recent form, which has coincided with their
Champions League progress to the quarter-finals, has seen the
pack close the gap.


Henk ten Cate's men were ahead 2-0 at the break through goals
from Huntelaar and Wesley Sneijder.


Former Ajax forward Patrick Kluivert pulled a goal back in the
second half but as PSV pushed forward for the equaliser, Ajax
scored three goals on the break.


PSV were hit hard by the absence of Brazilian defender Alex and
Ivory Coast striker Arouna Kone.


Another goal from Huntelaar, and others from Garcia Gabri and
Kenneth Perez sealed the rout.
