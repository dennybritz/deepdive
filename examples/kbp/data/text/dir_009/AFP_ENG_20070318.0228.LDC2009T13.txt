Insurgents killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens in Iraq
on Sunday in a series of bomb attacks targeting civilians and
security forces, police and security officials said.


Insurgents set off a car bomb in a popular market in Baghdad's
mainly Shiite district of Shaab, killing six people and wounding
30, a security official said.


The bomb struck the well-known Shallal market near the Shiite
stronghold of Sadr City in the northeast of the Iraqi capital.


The official said the toll "could rise as the incident occurred
in a popular market."


A policeman and a civilian were killed and five policemen wounded
when a roadside bomb struck a police patrol near the renowned Al-
Mustansiriyah University in east Baghdad, a security official
with the defence ministry said.


Another civilian was killed and one wounded in a mortar attack in
central Baghdad's Al-Fadhel district, another security source
said.


Two workers were also shot dead by gunmen in central Baghdad's
Shorja market, which has often been targeted by insurgents.


The attacks in the capital came despite a massive security
crackdown, with 90,000 US and Iraqi forces patrolling the streets
since February 14.


In northern Iraq, a roadside bomb that struck a passing police
patrol killed three policemen and wounded three, police said.


The attack came south of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
