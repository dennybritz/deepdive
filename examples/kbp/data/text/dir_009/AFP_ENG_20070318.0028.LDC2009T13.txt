Malaysia has introduced a new tough anti-terror law under which
convicted terrorists and those who fund them face the mandatory
death penalty, a report said Sunday.


The Sunday Star newspaper said the new law came into effect on
March 6. A minister declined to comment on the report.


Under the law, those convicted of acts of terrorism that cause
death and those convicted of giving financial aid to such
terrorists would meet the same fate, it said. The death sentence
in Malaysia is carried out by hanging.


If there is no death, the convicted persons would be liable to a
jail sentence of between seven and 30 years.


The new law defines terrorist acts as providing devices, training
facilities as well as harbouring terrorists and intentionally not
giving information about the terrorists.


Malaysia already has a controversial draconian security law, the
Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for indefinite
detention without trial.


Malaysia is currently holding over 100 people in detention under
the act, more than 80 of whom are described as suspected Islamic
militants.
