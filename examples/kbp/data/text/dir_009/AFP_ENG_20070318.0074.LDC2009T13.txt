Tokyo's public transportation system Sunday introduced a common
fare card called Pasmo, which allows commuters to ride almost all
the trains, subways and buses in the capital without buying
separate tickets.


East Japan Railway Co. (JR East), one of the nation's main
railway operators, has already offered a similar service in Tokyo
with a rechargeable integrated- circuit card called Suica.


Users of Suica, which also can be used as a commuting train pass,
do not need to buy tickets and simply hold it over a censor at
gates to get on trains.


But they still have to buy tickets at venders or use
unrechargeable cards when they use the train systems operated by
other companies, including subway lines and buses.


Pasmo can interchange with the Suica card, and its users can ride
almost all the trains and buses in Tokyo and neighboring
prefectures.


Users of the Pasmo card, which can be recharged by up to 20,000
yen (170 dollars) at once, can also use it as electronic money at
station stands and convenience stores.
