The United States will refuse to deal with the new Palestinian
government unless it forgoes violence and fully recognizes
Israel, US national security adviser Stephen Hadley said Sunday.


"This government needs to renounce terror and violence," Hadley
told CNN television Sunday. "It needs to acknowledge the right of
Israel to exist," he said.


Hadley, a senior White House official, said those conditions so
far have not been met.


"That is why we will not deal with this government," he said.


"We will not deal with this government until it accepts those
principles," he added.


"We'll be watching obviously for the words and deeds of this
government."
