Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday a solid foundation of
national security and strong ties with the US were the best ways
for Japan to deal with any threat from North Korea.


"We are facing many difficult issues, such as North Korea's
abduction, nuclear development and the launch of ballistic
missiles," he said in a speech at a National Defence Academy
graduation ceremony.


"We need to create a solid foundation of national security while
further strengthening our alliance with the United States," he
said.


Abe's speech was addressed to the National Defence Academy's
first class graduating under the defence ministry, which was
launched under the conservative premier's efforts to build a more
assertive nation.


Japan in January elevated its defence agency to the first full-
fledged defence ministry since World War II.


Abe, Japan's first premier to be born after the war, made the
creation of a defence ministry one of his priorities. He also
aims eventually to rewrite the US-imposed 1947 constitution.


Abe's speech came as envoys from six nations -- the two Koreas,
China, the US, Japan and Russia -- are set to resume negotiations
over Pyongyang's denuclearisation on Monday in Beijing.


Abe, who has championed a hardline North Korean policy, refused
to fund a February 13 nuclear deal reached in the previous six-
nation disarmament talks.


Pyongyang promised to begin shutting down its nuclear programme
within two months in exchange for energy aid and diplomatic
concessions.
