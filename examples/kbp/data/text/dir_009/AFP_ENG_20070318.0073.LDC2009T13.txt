The United States is ready to work with individual members of the
new Palestinian government who are not from Hamas, which
Washington considers a terrorist outfit, an embassy spokeswoman
said on Sunday.


"Individuals who are not members of foreign terrorist
organisations but who do hold office in the unity government, we
do not rule out contact with those individuals," the spokeswoman
said.
