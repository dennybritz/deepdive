Polling stations opened across Finland on Sunday for legislative
elections that are expected to return Prime Minister Matti
Vanhanen to power thanks to his strong economic record.


Vanhanen's Centre Party and its coalition partners the Social
Democrats and the tiny Swedish People's Party held a slim lead in
the opinion polls prior to Sunday's vote.
