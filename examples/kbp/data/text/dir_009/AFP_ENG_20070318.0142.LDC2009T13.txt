Europe's leading travel and tourism group TVI is set to approve a
merger of its tourism division with British company First Choice,
a French newspaper reported Sunday.


The project would create a new company with 17 billion euros (23
billion dollars) in sales turnover and would be led by First
Choice head Peter Lang, La Tribune reported on its Internet site.


All of TUI's tourism activity, except for its hotel business,
would become part of the British tour company, which is the
fourth largest of its kind on the European market, La Tribune
said, citing a source close to the company.


TUI is set to announce a loss of some 850 million euros (1.1
billion dollars) for 2006, the newspaper reported. TUI's
activities also include maritime transport.


The company has long been searching for stable shareholders to
prevent a possible break-up of the group amid pressure from hedge
funds for the shipping activities to be sold off.
