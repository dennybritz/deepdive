England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was dropped for the World Cup
Group C match against Canada here Sunday.


Flintoff, who was not at the ground, was omitted after reports
he'd been one of a number of players who'd stayed out until the
early hours of Saturday morning following England's six-wicket
defeat by New Zealand in their opening game here Friday.


His place in the side was taken by Essex all-rounder Ravi Bopara,
making his World Cup debut.


In a statement, the England and Wales Cricket Board said: "Andrew
Flintoff has been left out of the team for a breach of team
discipline. A further statement will be issued in due course."


England captain Michael Vaughan said of Flintoff's situation:
"We'll talk about it later today with the team management group.


"He (Flintoff) is not here today, he's back at the team hotel,"
Vaughan also told Sky Sports.


The News of the World, Britain's biggest-selling Sunday
newspaper, reported that Flintoff had to be rescued at 4am local
time after capsizing a pedalo following the loss to New Zealand.


Among the other players reported to have been fined for staying
out for a late night drinking session at the Rumours Nightclub
near England's team hotel were James Anderson, Ian Bell, Jon
Lewis and Liam Plunkett.
