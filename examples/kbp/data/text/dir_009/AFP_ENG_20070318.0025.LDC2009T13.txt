A homemade bomb in a Pakistan market damaged four music and video
shops on Sunday just weeks after their owners refused an order to
close down from Islamic hardliners.


Police said two people were injured in the blast at a market in
Peshawar, the largest city in the deeply conservative North West
Frontier Province along the border with Afghanistan.


One of the shopowners, Bashir Khan, said that hardliners calling
themselves the "Soldiers of Islam" had left him a note several
weeks ago, saying that music shops in the Gulshan market should
close their doors.


"We had informed the police about the note and requested them to
provide security," Khan said.


The blast left a crater and damaged the roof and pillar of market
building, and also shattered windows in nearby houses, local
police official Abdul Qadir told AFP.


The inured guard had been admitted to hospital and his condition
was stable, while the injured passer by was released after giving
first aid, he said.


The guard said that an unidentified man had handed him a tin of
cooking oil which exploded minutes after the man left.


The province has seen previous attacks on video and music shops
blamed on extremists emulating the ultra-orthodox Taliban, who
ruled neighbouring Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.


There has been growing concern about the "Talibanisation" of
Pakistan and the introduction of Islamic sharia law in tribal
areas.


Last week two men and a woman were stoned and shot to death for
adultery in a tribal area.
