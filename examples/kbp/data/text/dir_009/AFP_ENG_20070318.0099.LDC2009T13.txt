An Islamic group in Germany called for the immediate release of
two German citizens abducted in Iraq, in an interview published
on Sunday.


"The kidnapping has nothing to do with the nature of our religion
and also finds no justification in the Koran," the chairman of
the Islamic Council for Germany, Ali Kizilkaya, told Bild am
Sonntag.


"I call on the kidnappers in the name of humanity: Let the
innocent hostages go immediately."


Hannelore Krause, who is 61 and married to an Iraqi doctor, and
their 20-year- old son Sinan, who works at the Iraqi foreign
ministry, were seized on February 6.


Sunday's appeal came after Krause's husband and Sinan's wife made
an emotional plea for their release in a video message broadcast
on channels in Germany and the Arab world Friday.


And German President Horst Koehler last week also called for
their release in a video broadcast.


Earlier this month, a militant Islamist group in Iraq called the
Kataeb Siham al-Haq (Righteous Arrows Battalions) threatened to
execute the hostages unless Germany pulls its troops out of
Afghanistan.


Germany has nearly 3,000 troops in northern Afghanistan, where it
commands the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.
