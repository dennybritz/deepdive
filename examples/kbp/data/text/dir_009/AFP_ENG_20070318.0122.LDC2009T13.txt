Working women neglect their children and are responsible for the
downfall of Swiss society, the chairman of the rightwing Swiss
People's Party (SVP) said on Sunday.


"It is wrong when mothers work and the state looks after the
children," Ueli Maurer told the SonntagsBlick newspaper in an
interview.


"It is not the role of the state to finance creches, because
having children is a matter of personal responsibility," he said.


"Increasingly, no sooner has a mother left the hospital, than she
drops off the child at the creche or playgroup, and then goes to
McDonald's with them on Sunday. This is the downfall of our
society!" Mauerer claimed.


Swiss sociey is not known for its feminist leanings: women did
not win the right to vote there until 1971.


The conservative German-speaking canton of Appenzell, where many
still see a woman's role as "Kinder, Kirche, Kueche," (children,
church and kitchen), held out even longer. They did not approve
female suffrage in local elections until 1989.


The country has shed its chauvinist nature somewhat in the
intervening years, and even boasts a female president, Micheline
Calmy-Rey, who also serves as foreign minister.


The SVP, led by rightwing populist and billionaire industrialist
Christoph Blocher, still remains overwhelmingly male in character
with only three women among its 62 parliamentarians.


Maurer said he was untroubled by this state of affairs.


"There are not only emancipated women who make big speeches in
Bern. There are also women who deliberately choose not to follow
a career and are happy to be mothers. I think that's great," he
said.
