Newcastle's former Test skipper Andrew Johns was hospitalised
after being knocked out by a Sonny Bill Williams high tackle in
an explosive opening round of Australia's National Rugby League
Sunday.


The Gold Coast Titans made their NRL debut but were overshadowed
by the controversy in Newcastle as the Knights beat the
Canterbury Bulldogs 25-24.


The biggest moment of the game came inside the fourth minute when
superstar Johns was left unconscious for several minutes after
taking the full brunt of Williams' swinging left arm.


The Kiwi Test backrower was sent off while Johns was stretchered
off and taken to hospital.


He was later cleared of facial fractures but will likely miss
next Friday's match with St George Illawarra after suffering a
heavy concussion.


Williams is certain to face a judicial charge later this week.


Down to 12 men, the Bulldogs led 24-8 at halftime, but conceded
three tries in 18 minutes after the break to leave the score
24-24. Knights back Kurt Gidley then secured victory with a 73rd-
minute drop goal.


In Brisbane, the Gold Coast made their long-awaited debut in
front of 42,030 fans at Lang Park but had their party spoiled by
St George Illawarra, who won 20-18 despite fielding four rookies
and missing injured star Mark Gasnier.
