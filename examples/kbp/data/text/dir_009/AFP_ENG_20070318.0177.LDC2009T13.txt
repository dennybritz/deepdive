Cesare Battisti, a former Italian revolutionary who went into
hiding in France two and a half years ago, was arrested Sunday in
Brazil, French justice officials said.


Battisti, 52, disappeared in August 2004, shortly before the
French government signed an extradition order to return him to
Italy, where he has been convicted in absentia for four murders.


A former member of the Armed Proletarians for Communism, Battisti
lived in Paris from 1990 where he made his name as a crime
writer.


He was arrested in a hotel in Rio de Janeiro as he was meeting a
member of his support committee, who had travelled to Brazil to
give him money, Le Figaro newspaper reported on its website.


Battisti's plight has been taken up by campaigners in France, who
in 2004 vainly urged the government not to accede to Italy's
extradition request.


In 1993 the former revolutionary was given a life sentence by an
Italian court for his role in four murders committed in 1978 and
1979.


Supporters say his conviction rested on faulty evidence and that
because he was tried in absentia there should be a re-trial --
which Italy refuses.


Battisti benefitted for many years from a policy instituted by
socialist president Francois Mitterrand under which Italian left-
wing extremists could stay in France if they abandoned their
commitment to armed struggle.
