Austria's Nicole Hosp secured the women's overall World Cup crown
after winning the final race of the season, a giant slalom, on
Sunday.


The 23-year-old, one of a handful of exciting up and coming all-
rounders who will be aiming to peak at the Vancouver Olympics in
2010, beat compatriot Marlies Schild to alpine skiing's
prestigious crown.


Schild had been engaged in a late-season duel with Austrian
veteran Renate Goetschl, however Hosp launched her own bid for
the coveted trophy with some solid skiing displays in the final
weeks.


In the past month and 11 races which followed the world
championships she claimed precious World Cup points from three
victories and six podium places, finishing outside each race's
top ten only twice.


On Sunday Hosp, who won the giant slalom gold at the world
championships in Are, Sweden last month, won her fourth race of
the season to finish top of the World Cup standings with a points
total of 1572s.


Schild, the partner of Austrian ace Benjamin Raich, could only
finish sixth in the giant slalom meaning she finished on a total
of 1482.


American Julia Mancuso finished on a total of 1356.


Raich had earlier won the men's concluding slalom but ultimately
failed to defend his World Cup overall crown.


Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal finished in 15th place to secure his
first major crystal globe by a slim margin of 13 World Cup
points.
