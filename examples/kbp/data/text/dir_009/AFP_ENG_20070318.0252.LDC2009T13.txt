Britain's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla are to become
grandparents as the Duchess of Cornwall's son and his wife are
expecting a baby, according to the Mail on Sunday.


"We have told our friends and family and they are all delighted,"
Tom Parker Bowles was quoted as saying in the weekly newspaper.


Bowles's wife, fashion journalist Sara Buys, 34, is three months
pregnant with their first child. The couple tied the knot in
September 2005.


"Mummy is absolutely thrilled at the prospect of becoming a
grandmother," added Tom, 32.


Camilla, who left hospital last Thursday following a
hysterectomy, has two children from her first marriage to Andrew
Parker Bowles -- Tom and Laura.


"It's the best Mothering Sunday present Camilla could wish for,"
the paper quoted a family friend as saying.


"Camilla has had a difficult few weeks with her own operation and
this has lifted her spirits entirely."
