The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading among poultry farms
around northern Nigeria's largest city, Kano, despite control
measures, a senior veterinary official said on Sunday.


"The avian influenza virus is still spreading among poultry farms
and it has so far affected 33 farms in seven districts," Shehu
Bawa, head of Kano State's Committee on Avian Flu, told AFP.


More than 80,000 birds have been culled in Kano, Bawa added.


Further measures taken to check the outbreak include controls on
movement of poultry and people, disinfecting farm workers and
visitors, fencing off farms, and a ban on borrowing of farm
implements from them.


Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation with some 140
million people, early this year reported west Africa's first
human bird flu death.


A 22-year-old woman died in Lagos on January 17 weeks after
plucking and disembowelling a chicken.


Bird flu was first detected on a farm in Jaji town outside the
northern city of Kano in February last year from where it spread
to other parts of Nigeria.


Kano, northern Nigeria's most populous city, was worst affected
by the flu outbreak which ravaged 97 farms in the city resulting
in the death or culling of at least 300,000 birds, officials
said.


Three more northern states -- Katsina, Sokoto and Bauchi -- have
recorded a resurgence of bird flu since it resurfaced in Kano.
