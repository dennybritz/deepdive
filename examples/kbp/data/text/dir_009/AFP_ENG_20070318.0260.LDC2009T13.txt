German Stefan Schumacher won the fifth stage of the Tirreno-
Adriatico on Sunday, an individual time-trial over 20.5
kilometres from Civitanova to Civitanova Alta.


The Gerolsteiner rider won with a time of 27 minutes and eight
seconds.


Andreas Kloden took the overall lead of the one-week stage race
after finishing in second place, a second behind fellow German
Schumacher.


Tirreno-Adriatico runs between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic coasts
and is an important warm-up for the Milan-San Remo classic race,
which takes place on March 24.
