Andrew Flintoff was axed as vice-captain of the England team at
the World Cup after being dropped for Sunday's Group C match
against Canada because of his off-field behaviour, the England
and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced.


The statement said Flintoff would not be considered for the
England captaincy should Michael Vaughan be injured at any stage
during the World Cup.
