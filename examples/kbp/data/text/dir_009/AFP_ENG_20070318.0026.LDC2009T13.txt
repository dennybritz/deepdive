The dispute over North Korean funds frozen in Macau at the centre
of negotiations on a nuclear disarmament deal has been resolved,
an unnamed South Korean official was quoted saying Sunday.


Yonhap news agency cited the official saying that there were "no
more issues in dispute" and that there was "little possibility
the North will object" to a US move to free up the funds, the
report said. It did not give further details.


The US Treasury said last week that it had cleared the way for
the release of the funds, originally frozen by US sanctions due
to concerns that the bank was laundering money for North Korea.


The move now leaves it up to the Macau authorities to decide what
to do with the cash after the bank was left in receivership, US
Treasury official Daniel Glaser said Saturday after talks with
authorities in Macau.


Yonhap said the frozen funds, amounting to about 25 million
dollars, are likely to be released before the end of the next
round of six-party talks, which are set to begin in Beijing
Monday.


US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said earlier
that he was confident lingering questions about the funds would
not derail the six-nation talks.


"I think we have a pretty reasonable position that I think that
meets everyone's interest, so I'm pretty confident we can resolve
that," Hill told reporters in Beijing.
