Polling stations opened across Finland on Sunday for legislative
elections that are expected to return Prime Minister Matti
Vanhanen to power thanks to his strong economic record.


Vanhanen's Centre Party and its coalition partners, the Social
Democrats and the tiny Swedish People's Party, held a slim lead
over the opposition in the opinion polls prior to Sunday's vote.


The Centre Party was credited with between 23.3 and 24.7 percent
of voter intentions in final polls after an election campaign
that has focused on health care, care for the elderly and job
creation.


If Vanhanen emerges victorious he could choose to continue his
centre-left coalition, or shift to a centre-right alliance with
the Conservative National Coalition Party.


The Social Democrats and the Conservatives are neck-and-neck in
the polls, with the former garnering between 21.3 and 22.6
percent support and the latter between 20.4 and 22.1 percent.


Some 4.2 million Finns are registered to vote. Polling stations
opened at 9:00 am (0700 GMT) and were due to close at 8:00 pm
(1800 GMT).


Preliminary results, including those of the 1.19 million voters
who opted to vote in advance, were expected shortly after the
polls close, while definitive results were expected around 11:00
pm (2100 GMT).
