Palestinian militants fired two rockets into Israel from the Gaza
Strip on Sunday without causing casualties, the Israeli army
said. One struck south of the coastal city of Ashkelon.


The latest rocket attacks came despite a ceasefire which has been
in force between Israel and Gaza militants since last November
26.


Under the terms of the agreement, the Israeli army withdrew its
troops from the coastal territory in exchange for Palestinian
militants stopping the rocket fire.


However, more than 100 rockets have since been fired into Israel
despite the truce.


Meanwhile near Nablus in the north of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank, the army said it had arrested two Palestinians in
possession of seven kilos of explosives hidden in a gas cylinder.
