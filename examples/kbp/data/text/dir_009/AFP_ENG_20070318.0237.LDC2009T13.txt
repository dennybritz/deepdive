Saudi telecom authorities have chosen seven of nine firms who
tendered for the kingdom's third mobile phone licence for further
study and submission to the cabinet.


The seven bidders are a mix of local and regional firms,
including MTC and Partners Consortium, led by MTC of Kuwait, and
Oger Telecom Consortium, headed by the Oger Telecom group
belonging to the Hariri family of Lebanon.


In a statement on Saturday, the Communication and Information
Technology Commission said an initial evaluation meant that
tenders from the seven would be opened in public on March 24.


Final evaluation of the financial proposals would go to the
commission directors, after which the Saudi cabinet would award
the licence to the successful bidder.


The other firms were named as Samawat Consortium, Kingdom
Turkcell Consortium, Tawasul Consortium, MTN Saudi Arabia
Consortium, and Consortium Abdullah Abdulaziz Al-Rajhi Reliance
Communications.
