Ecological associations on Sunday warned of a potential risk to
Spain's southern coastline from an oil tanker in the Strait of
Gibraltar carrying 40,000 tonnes of fuel which ran aground in the
area.


Greenpeace and the Verdemar ecological pressure group demanded
authorities take action to extract the fuel after the Greek
tanker Samothraki ran aground about a kilometre off Gibraltar and
was towed to port Saturday in the British dependent territory.


The Gibraltar government said inspection of the vessel had shown
it to be in good condition and added that its cargo posed no risk
of leakage and no danger to the environment.


But a Greenpeace spokesman told Spain's Europa Press news agency
that the incident "again throwns into sharp relief the constant
dangers" to which the Bay of Algeciras abutting Gibraltar is
exposed.


According to the organisation, an average year sees between 4,000
and 5,000 vessels sail through the Strait of Gibraltar.


Spain is highly sensitive to the risk posed by vessels
negotiating its coastline following the major environmental
disaster which struck four years ago when the Prestige oil tanker
went down off the northwestern region of Galicia.


On that occasion, the worst environmental disaster Spain has
known, some 64,000 tonnes of fuel leaked out and polluted beaches
as far away as southwestern France.
