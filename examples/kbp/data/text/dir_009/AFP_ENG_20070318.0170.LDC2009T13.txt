Italian Justice Minister Clemente Mastella on Sunday hailed the
"brilliant operation" leading to the arrest of former
revolutionary Cesare Battisti in Brazil.


Mastella, speaking to the ANSA news agency, congratulated Italian
forces working together with Brazilian and French authorities and
said he hoped "the extradition procedure will lead to Battisti's
speedy return to Italy."


Battisti had gone into hiding in France two and a half years ago,
shortly before the French government signed an extradition order
to return him to Italy, where he has been convicted in absentia
for four murders.
