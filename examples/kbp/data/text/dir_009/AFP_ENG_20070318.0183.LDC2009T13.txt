Cesare Battisti, a former Italian communist revolutionary who
went into hiding in France two and a half years ago, was arrested
Sunday in Brazil, officials here said.


Battisti, 52, disappeared in August 2004 shortly before the
French government signed an extradition order to return him to
Italy, where he has been convicted in absentia for four murders.
