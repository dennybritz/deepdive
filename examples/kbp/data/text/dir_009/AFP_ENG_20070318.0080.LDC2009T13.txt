Afghanistan's Taliban said Sunday they had handed an Italian
journalist captured two weeks ago to tribal elders after two
Taliban members were freed, but would take him back if a third
was not released.


Daniele Mastrogiacomo's employer, La Republica, said in Rome
meanwhile it had "learned that the journalist was freed."


But the Italian foreign ministry in Rome could not confirm the
report.


" We'll consider him free when he's safely in Italian hands," a
spokesman said.


The Italian ambassador in Kabul, Ettore Francesco Sequie also
said he had no evidence of his release.


Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP that Mastrogiacomo and
his Afghan translator were handed to elders in Helmand province
after the government freed two members of the group, Latif Hakimi
and Ustad Yasar.


But the Taliban also wanted another man, spokesman Mohammad
Hanif, to be released.


"Today, Hakimi and Yasar were released and we too handed over the
journalist and his Afghan friend to the tribal elders," Ahmadi
said.


"If Hanif is not released, we'll take back the journalists,"
Ahmadi said.


"Once Hanif is released, the elders can take the Italian anywhere
he wishes to go -- we'll let him go."


The interior ministry and an intelligence agency spokesman said
Sunday they were not aware of any agreement to free any Taliban
in custody.


The Italian embassy in Kabul also was unaware of any such
agreement.
