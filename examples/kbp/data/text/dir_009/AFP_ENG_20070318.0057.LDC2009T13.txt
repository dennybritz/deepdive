A group of 24 Muslims from Thailand's insurgency-plagued south
have fled to Malaysia to escape alleged intimidation by the Thai
military, a report said Sunday.


Fearing their safety, the group complained that they have been
beaten and that their sons have been missing or detained since
2005, the Sunday Star newspaper said.


The group from Narathiwat province arrived in Muslim-majority
Malaysia's Rantau Panjang village on Saturday through an illegal
crossing. A local immigration official told AFP he was not aware
of their arrival.


At least 2,000 people have been killed in separatist violence
that has gripped three Muslim-majority provinces in southern
Thailand since January 2004.


A 55-year-old spokesman for the group of new arrivals said a bomb
attack on a mosque in his village has made it difficult for
Muslims to pray.


"Last week after the bomb blast, which injured scores of my
neighbours, Thai soldiers came and simply arrested the local
youths," he said on condition of anonymity.


He said that since the arrest, many youths were missing and some
died after they were allegedly poisoned during detention.


The group said they were not seeking political asylum in
Malaysia, but wanted Malaysia to help stop the bloody violence.


The latest incident follows the flight of 131 Muslims from
southern Thailand in 2005. They are being held in a Malaysian
immigration depot. Last December a second group of 20 Thai
Muslims entered the country.
