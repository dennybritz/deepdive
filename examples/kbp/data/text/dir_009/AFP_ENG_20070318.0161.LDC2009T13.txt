Canada captain John Davison won the toss and elected to field in
his side's Group C World Cup match against England here Sunday.


England dropped Andrew Flintoff for "a breach of team discipline"
following reports the all-rounder had capsized a pedalo in the
early hours of Saturday morning following the side's six-wicket
loss to New Zealand in their World Cup opener here Friday.


Several other England players were reported to have been seen out
late, at a nightclub near the team's hotel, after the New Zealand
defeat.


Flintoff's place was taken by Ravi Bopara, the Essex all-rounder
making his World Cup debut in only his second one-day
international


Canada, thrashed by seven wickets in their Group C opener by
Kenya last week, made two changes with Desmond Chumney replacing
Qaiser Ali and George Codrington in for Henry Osinde.
