Romanian international water polo player Iss Lajos died suddenly
late Saturday shortly after a match with his French club Senlis.


Senlis club president Franklin Lepage told AFP the 24-year-old
collapsed in the parking lot of nearby club Tourcoing.


"He collapsed suddenly just after putting his bag into the car,"
said Lepage.


Lepage said it appeared the player may have suffered a massive
stroke.


Lajos arrived in France three years ago and while playing for his
club was enrolled in sports studies.


"He was one of our best players. We are completely stunned,"
added Lepage.
