Syrian police on Sunday confirmed that four people had died after
two blocks of flats collapsed in a working class district of the
main northern city of Aleppo.


"Rescue teams were able to recover four bodies from the rubble of
the flats which collapsed in Bustan al-Basha on Saturday
evening," civil defence chief Ammar Maluhi told the official SANA
news agency.


"The emergency services and fire brigade are continuing their
searches" through the remains of the five-storey blocks, he
added.


Police were still looking for a fifth resident reported missing
earlier.


Government daily Ath-Thawra blamed the incident on "poor
construction" of the blocks which were built 35 years ago.
