Eurostar trains ran on a normal schedule Sunday following a
trackside fire this week that brought chaos to the service.


Services had resumed Saturday between London, Brussels and Paris
after British fire authorities allowed railway lines near the
scene of the blaze to reopen.


"The service is back to normal," a Eurostar spokesman told AFP.


"We're running a normal Eurostar service that we would have
expected to run today for a Sunday in both directions."


Would-be passengers from all three capitals had journeys via the
Channel Tunnel disrupted by the cancellation of the high-speed
trains after the fire near the London terminus at Waterloo
station threatened to explode gas cylinders. The fire had been
extinguished on Friday.


The spokesman added: "We are obviously carrying those travellers
who had booked to travel today and we are also accommodating
people who had booked to travel on either directions on Friday
and Saturday.


"Unfortunately, we were unable to run any additional service
because of the train crew displacement because we had to stop the
trains in different locations."


During the disruption, almost 23,000 passengers were prevented
from travelling on Eurostar trains to and from London and
continental Europe, according to revised data from Eurostar.
