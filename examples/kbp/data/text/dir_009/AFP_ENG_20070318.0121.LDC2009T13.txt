Several Taiwanese female lawmakers said Sunday they will propose
a revision of criminal laws so that caning can be introduced for
repeat sex offenders in a bid to deter such crimes.


Sex offenders "commit the crimes for temporary gratification but
they cause lifetime trauma to the victims," said lawmaker Hsueh
Ling of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.


The proposal came after two men were nabbed earlier this week for
allegedly abducting a medical student outside a mass rapid
transit (MRT) station in Taipei and taking her to a park to rape
her.


Police said one of the men, who was previously convicted of sex
offences, was suspected of sexually assaulting a 64-year-old
female taxi driver only hours before his arrest on Saturday.


The case was widely covered in the local media and provoked calls
for harsher punishment for sex offenders.


The lawmakers said they hoped to revise the law in time to punish
the duo with caning.


Caning has been used in Singapore on sex offenders.
