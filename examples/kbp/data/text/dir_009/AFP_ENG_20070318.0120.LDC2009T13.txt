A prominent Iranian businessman has been recaptured abroad a
month after escaping from a prison where he was serving a lengthy
sentence for corruption, state media reported on Sunday.


"(Shahram) Jazayeri was arrested yesterday (Saturday) and is
being brought back to Iran," the official IRNA agency quoted
judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi as saying.


"He was arrested abroad and I don't want to say any more on the
place where he was arrested," he said.


Jazayeri was arrested in 2002 as part of a major anti-corruption
campaign. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison, 10 years in
exile and a fine of 122 million dollars for corruption.


He was accused of paying huge bribes to scores of reformist and
conservative MPs and officials to try to secure inside
information and legislation favourable to his import-export
business empire.


Since his escape, Iranian newspapers reported that Jazayeri was
either in another Gulf country or in Germany.


Several high-ranking officials were sacked after Jazayeri's
escape.
