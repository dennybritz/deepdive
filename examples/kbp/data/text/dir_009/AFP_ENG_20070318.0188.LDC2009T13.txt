Switzerland's former two-time Olympic ski jump champion Simon
Ammann got back to winning ways after defying the blustery
conditions here Sunday, which proved a hindrance to some of his
rivals.


Ammann, recently crowned the world large hill champion in Japan,
kept a cool head to claim victory ahead of Austria's Martin Koch
and flying Finn Matti Hautamaeki.


After event officials decided to reduce the competition to one
jump instead of the scheduled two because of the wind one of the
biggest losers was Polish ace Adam Malysz, who finished in 54th
place and lost the World Cup lead.


Malysz, the winner of the past three jumps, was one of several
contenders to meet with trouble although he was happy to land on
two feet after being forced to dramatically correct his position
after being blown about in mid-flight.


It means Malysz now sits second overall behind Norway's Anders
Jacobsen, who has a 14-point lead with three events to be held
this season.
