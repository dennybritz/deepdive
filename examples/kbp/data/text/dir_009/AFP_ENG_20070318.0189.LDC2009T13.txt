Italian Justice Minister Clemente Mastella on Sunday hailed the
"brilliant operation" leading to the arrest of former
revolutionary Cesare Battisti in Brazil.


Mastella, speaking to the ANSA news agency, congratulated Italian
forces working together with Brazilian and French authorities and
said he hoped "the extradition procedure will lead to Battisti's
speedy return to Italy."


Pietro Forno, deputy prosecutor of Turin, also hailed Battisti's
arrest, saying the former member of the Armed Proletarians for
Communism was still dangerous 14 years after being convicted in
absentia for four murders.


"Nothing suggests that he has changed in terms of his
dangerousness," Forno told ANSA.


Forno, recalling "fierce attacks" against him in the 1980s when
he pursued Battisti, criticised the French authorities for what
he described as a "permissive" attitude at the time.


"For a long time, (they) thought people like Cesare Battisti were
victims of trials without evidence and political persecution," he
said.
