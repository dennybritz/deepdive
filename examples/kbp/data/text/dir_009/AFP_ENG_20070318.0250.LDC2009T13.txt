The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been found in the body of
an endangered eagle in southern Japan, the environment ministry
said Sunday, according to reports.


The ministry had tasked a laboratory at Tottori University with
examining the female of the species, called the mountain hawk
eagle, after it was found in the village of Sagara, in Kumamoto
Prefecture, on January 4. The sick bird died shortly afterwards,
according to the Kyodo news agency.


The ministry plans to catch wild birds and collect bird droppings
around the area where the bird was found.


The bird is on the Japanese government's list of endangered
species and there are believed to be some 1,800 inhabiting
mountainous areas from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the
south, the report said.


Authorities in Japan this month declared an end to recent bird
flu outbreaks, and lifted a ban on transferring chickens and eggs
in the areas affected.


Japan reported four outbreaks of bird flu's virulent H5N1 strain
in January and February, leading authorities to kill tens of
thousands of chickens as a precaution.


The H5N1 virus has killed around 160 people across the world
since late 2003 through contact with infected birds.


Japan confirmed an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in
January 2004 and has since seen periodic cases.
