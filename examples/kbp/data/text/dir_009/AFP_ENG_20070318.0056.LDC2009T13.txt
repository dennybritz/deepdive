Renault say they have a challenging season ahead to retain their
world constructors' team title after a dominant opening by
Ferrari to the new Formula One season.


Kimi Raikkonen dominated the Australian Grand Prix to beat
McLaren pair Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton and give Ferrari
the first win of the 17-race season.


Alonso left two-time world champions Renault for McLaren at the
end of last season and the Anglo-French team got their reality
check with Giancarlo Fisichella's fifth placing their best finish
on Sunday.


"The race proved more difficult than we had expected," Fisichella
said.


"We knew that we were not on the pace of the leaders, but we had
hoped to make up some ground and now we realise there is a lot of
work to do."


Team principal Flavio Briatore wasn't happy with the returns on
the opening weekend's work.


"This afternoon showed us that we have a lot of work to do to be
competitive again. It wasn't a strong race for the team in any
department," Briatore said.


"We were expecting more at every level and we need to work hard
to find the performance."


Head team engineer Pat Symonds said there was much to do ahead of
the next GP in Malaysia on April 8.


"We now have a much clearer idea of the car's performance and
three days of testing ahead of us in Malaysia before the next
Grand Prix," Symonds said.


Renault beat Ferrari by five points for last year's constructors'
title, spearheaded by the now departed champion driver Alonso.
