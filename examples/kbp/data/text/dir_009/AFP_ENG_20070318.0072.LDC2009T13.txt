North Korea Sunday denounced an upcoming joint US-South Korea
military exercise as aimed at poisoning six-party disarmament
talks and bringing the Korean peninsula "to the brink of war".


"The US ruling quarter's moves to intensify war games in South
Korea are aimed to poison the atmosphere of the talks and drive
the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war," the
country's ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a
commentary.


The exercise also "goes against the six-party talks," it added.


The joint drills are due to begin on March 25, with hundreds of
thousands of South Korean troops and some 29,000 US soldiers
based here and abroad taking part, along with a US aircraft
carrier backed by cruisers and destroyers.


South Korea and the United States have defended the annual
exercise as being purely defensive.


The exercise is "a preliminary war, a nuclear test war, designed
to make a surprise preemptive attack" on North Korea, the
newspaper said.


"Their real intention is to while away the time with the six-
party talks and ignite a war against the DPRK (North Korea) when
a chance is given."


In a separate commentary late Saturday, the North's official
Korean Central News Agency hit out at Washington for carrying out
the exercise while negotiations are under way with Pyongyang as
part of the six-nation talks.


"Dialogue and war manoeuvres can never go together," it said.


North Korea is "fully prepared to deal merciless crushing blows
at the aggressors, not forgetting the US arrogant nature even a
moment," the agency said.
