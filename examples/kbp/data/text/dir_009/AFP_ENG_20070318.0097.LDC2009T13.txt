Germany's Andrea Henkel finished 15th in the women's 12.5km mass
start race here Sunday to secure the overall World Cup title.


The 29-year-old had a relatively disastrous time at the shooting
range with six mistakes from her two visits but kept a cool head
to ultimately hold off fellow contenders Kati Wilhelm and Anna-
Carin Olofsson.


German title holder Wilhelm had five faults and finished 17th
while Sweden's Olofsson had seven and finished in 20th in the
race.


Henkel thus brings her season to a triumphant end having won the
women's mass start gold medal at the world championships last
month, adding to her 15km Olympic title from Salt Lake City in
2002.


Sunday's race was won by Sweden's Helene Jonsson in a time of
39min 26sec, with only one mistake at the shooting range.


She finished 3.2 secs ahead of Ukrainian Oksana Khvostenko and
16.4secs ahead of Germany's Katrin Hitzer.
