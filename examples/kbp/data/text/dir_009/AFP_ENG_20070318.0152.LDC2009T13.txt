England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was dropped for the World Cup
Group C match against Canada here on Sunday.


Flintoff, who was not at the ground, was omitted after reports
he'd been one of a number of players who'd stayed out until the
early hours of the morning following England's six-wicket defeat
by New Zealand in their opening Group game here on Friday.
