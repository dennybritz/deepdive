Spaniard Alberto Contador of Discovery Channel capped an
audacious attack late in the final stage of Paris-Nice here on
Sunday to claim overall victory ahead of Italian Davide Rebellin.


Contador won the final stage and the race's yellow jersey in
dramatic fashion to claim his first major victory of the season.


Rebellin, who had started the day with a six-second lead on the
Spaniard, fought hard in the closing stages but finished in
eighth place at 22sec to drop to second overall in the event
known as the 'Race to the Sun'.


A day earlier the veteran Italian had managed to keep a calm head
and shake off an attack by Contador before the Spaniard wilted in
the closing stages and Rebellin retained the yellow jersey.


However on Sunday the Discovery Channel team, made famous by now-
retired seven- times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, went
out to make sure Contador was given another bite at the cherry.


After controlling much of the race in the latter stages the team
were only too happy to see Contador take flight on the Col d'Eze,
one of several featuring on the relatively short 129km stage.


Rebellin, who had been left shorn of any of his Gerolsteiner
teammates, crucially failed to follow. By the time he did, along
with several other riders, he was soon chasing a 30-sec lead by
Contador.


The Italian nevertheless failed to give up, and even launched a
solo pursuit of the Spaniard in the closing two kilometres.
