A group of three masked men dragged a hefty block of gold bullion
weighing about 100 kilograms (220 pounds) from a museum in
central Japan, police said Sunday.


The block of gold worth about 200 million yen (1.7 million
dollars) was placed in a safe and exhibited with the safe's door
open so that visitors to the museum could touch it, owner of the
gold, Hisao Nakahagi, told AFP.


"The gold was exhibited on the second floor, which was monitored
by a security camera from the first floor," said Nakahagi, 59.


"An employee on the first floor heard a noise from upstairs and
rushed up there," he said. "Three masked men were trying to move
the gold bullion."


The men pushed the employee aside, dragged the gold in a bag
downstairs, and drove away with a fourth accomplice, he said.
