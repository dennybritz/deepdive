A Manila court has allowed detained Muslim leader Nur Misuari to
file his candidacy for governor of the troubled southern province
of Sulu, it was reported Sunday.


According to MindaNews, Misuari, who has been in detention for
rebellion since January 7, 2002, is expected to fly to the
troubled southern island of Jolo on Tuesday to file his papers
for May mid-term elections.


According to the MindaNews web site, the Makati regional court
granted Misuari's request last week.


The government has not commented on the report.


As leader of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), Misuari
ended one of the longest-running insurgencies in Southeast Asia
when he signed a peace accord with then president Fidel Ramos in
1996.


The Muslim separatist struggle which began in 1972 claimed an
estimated 100,000 lives.


The accord gave Mindanao's Muslim minority substantial autonomy
under the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).


Misuari became governor of ARMM but was removed five years later
by his own followers for mismanagement and abuse of power.


In 2001, Misuari led a rebellion against the government of
President Gloria Arroyo. The rebellion was put down and Misuari
fled to Malaysia, where he was arrested.


He has been in detention ever since awaiting trial for rebellion.


Today, the government is negotiating a peace accord with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which broke away from the MNLF
when the ARMM was formed, claiming the agreement did not give
Muslims full autonomy.


The MILF has had a ceasefire with the government for three years
but talks have stalled over the issue of ancestral domain -- land
over which Muslims claim ownership.
