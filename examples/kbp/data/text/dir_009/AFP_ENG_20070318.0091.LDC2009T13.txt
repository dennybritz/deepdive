Around 2,000 demonstrators marched through Tokyo on Sunday,
protesting the Iraq war as well as hawkish Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe's attempt to revise the pacifist constitution.


The marchers carried banners reading "Stop Bush's war" and "Block
revision of the constitution" as they protested ahead of
Tuesday's fourth anniversary of the US invasion in Iraq.


Some chanted: "Overthrow the Abe regime!"


Japan last year ended its historic deployment of 600 troops on a
reconstruction mission to Iraq, the first time since World War II
that Tokyo had sent soldiers to a country where fighting was
under way.


Japan still has more than 200 personnel in Kuwait to fly supplies
and manpower into Iraq on behalf of the US-led coalition and the
United Nations.


The mission by Japan's air force is seen as mostly symbolic and
aimed at boosting Japan's alliance with Washington and showing
that the country has global clout.


Organisers estimated around 2,000 people took part in the march.


Abe, the prime minister, has vowed to erase the legacy of the
nation's defeat in World War II, and has made rewriting the US-
imposed 1947 pacifist constitution near the top of his political
agenda.
