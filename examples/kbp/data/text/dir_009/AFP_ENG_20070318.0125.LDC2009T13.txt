At least five people are missing after two apartment buildings
collapsed in a working class district of the northern Syrian city
of Aleppo, police said on Sunday.


"At least five people have been reported missing and a number of
people have been injured after the two buildings collapsed in
Butan al-Basha (on Saturday)," police officer Khatib al-Khatib
told AFP.


Rescuers were combing through the rubble to try to find people
who may still be trapped, he added.


According to the Ath-Thawra government daily, the two five-storey
buildings collapsed simultaneously on Saturday evening.


"There is contradictory information about the evacuation of
residents before the collapse," the newspaper said. "Half of a
third building behind the other two also fell down."


Ath-Thawra blamed the incident on "poor construction" of the
blocks which were built 35 years ago.


Al-Baath, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party, reported the
collapse of just one building in which more than 30 people lived.


It quoted Loqman Mustafa, a first-floor resident who managed to
get out before the collapse, as saying cracks started appearing
in the walls and ceilings on Saturday.
