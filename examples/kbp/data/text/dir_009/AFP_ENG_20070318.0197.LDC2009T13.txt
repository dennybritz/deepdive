British bank Barclays has approached Dutch investment bank ABN
Amro with a merger proposal to create a global banking titan
worth 80 billion pounds (155 billion dollars, 117 billion euros),
according to press reports here.


Barclays declined to comment on the story. "We never comment on
either market speculation or speculative reports," a company
spokesman told the AFX financial news wire service.


The combined group would create a serious rival to the world's
two biggest banks, HSBC and Citigroup.


The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph both said that the
informal approach from Barclays was at a "preliminary stage" and
may not lead to a deal.


Tentative talks were understood to have taken place within the
past month, the Sunday Telegraph added.


Both newspapers said that Barclays was keen to act as a white
knight to save ABN Amro from its current problems. The Dutch bank
is facing break-up demands from hedge fund investors The
Children's Investment Fund (TCI) and Toscafund.


Barclays is the third biggest bank in Britain, behind HSBC and
Royal Bank of Scotland. A merger with ABN Amro would put it in
second place.
