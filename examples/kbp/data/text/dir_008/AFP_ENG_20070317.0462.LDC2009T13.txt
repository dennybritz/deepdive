France's center-right candidate Nicolas Sarkozy would win in a
second round of the French presidential race against Socialist
rival Segolene Royal, according to an opinion poll published
Sunday.


Sarkozy, the country's interior minister, would win 52 percent of
the vote, with Royal garnering 48 percent, the Ipsos/Dell poll
conducted for SFR and Le Point magazine showed.


In the first round of the presidential election set for April 22,
Sarkozy would net 29.5 percent of the vote, Royal 25 percent and
centrist candidate Francois Bayrou 21 percent.


Far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen -- who caused a sensation
in 2002 when he made it to the second round of the presidential
vote to challenge Jacques Chirac -- would garner 12.5 percent of
the votes this time round.


The telephone poll was taken over three days from March 15 to 17
among a sampling of 1,252 people whose names were taken from
electoral lists.


The Ipsos/Dell daily opinion poll began on March 1 and will
continue to the eve of the second round of the vote set for May
6.
