Yemen urged the international community to recognise the new
Palestinian government of national unity and to lift the aid
blockade imposed on it, the official Saba news agency said.


"Yemen calls on the international community, in particular the
Quartet (the European Union, Russia, United Nations and United
States), to recognise this government and lift the aid embargo
imposed on the Palestinian people," the agency quoted Foreign
Minister Abu Bakr Abdullah al-Kurbi as saying.


On Saturday the Palestinian parliament voted in Gaza City to
approve the first government uniting president Mahmud Abbas's
Fatah faction and the Islamist Hamas movement of prime minister
Ismail Haniya.
