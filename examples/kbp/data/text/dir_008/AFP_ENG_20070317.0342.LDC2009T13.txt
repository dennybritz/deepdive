Serbian police on Saturday arrested four people after uncovering
a haul of plastic explosives and guns at a raid on a southern
mountain camp, reports said.


Police also seized munitions, bombs, ID cards and terrorist
propaganda in the swoop at the camp in the Velika Ninaja
mountain, near the border with Montenegro, said the state-run
news agency Tanjug.


The four men arrested are all Muslims originating from the city
of Novi Pazar, 250 kilometres (155 miles) southwest of Belgrade,
and are suspected of being part of a terrorist organisation.


Police have also launched a search for a fifth suspect.


Novi Pazar is the main town in the Sandzak region, which
straddles the Serbia- Montenegro border, and is home to two rival
Muslim political parties.


In recent years it has been the scene of a tense political
struggle that at times has flared into violence between
supporters of the ultra-nationalist SDA and the moderate
Democratic Party of Sandzak (SDP).


Muslims comprise some 45 percent of Sandzak's population of
around 420,000.
