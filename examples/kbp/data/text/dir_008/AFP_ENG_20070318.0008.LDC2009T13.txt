Five US soldiers were killed by roadside bombs while patrolling
the streets of Baghdad and another died in a non-combat incident
in northern Tikrit town, the US military said Sunday.


Four soldiers died and one was wounded when their unit was struck
by a roadside bomb while on patrol in west Baghdad on Saturday,
the military said in a statement.


Another soldier was wounded when the unit came under small arms
fire after the blast.


In a separate incident on Saturday, one soldier was killed and
three wounded while they were on foot patrol in south Baghdad.


A Task Force Lightning soldier died Saturday in a non-combat
related incident in Tikrit, 180 kilometres (110 miles) north of
Baghdad, a statement said, without elaborating.


The latest deaths brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,218, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
