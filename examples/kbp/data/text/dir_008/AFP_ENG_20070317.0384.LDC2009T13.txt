The wives of Cuban political prisoners urged the communist regime
Saturday to release their husbands as they marked the fourth
anniversary of a crackdown against 75 dissidents.


The "Ladies in White" group gathered in a Havana home, wearing
T-shirts with the pictures of their husbands who were rounded up
and sentenced to six to 28 years in prison between March 18-30.


The women decorated the home of Laura Pollan with a fake prison
cell and signs with the names of the prisons where the men are
held as they demanded their immediate and unconditional release.


"They are innocent men, they are neither thieves nor common
killers," Pollan, whose husband Hector Maseda was sentenced to 20
years in jail, said from inside the fake cell. "There is no
reason for them to be jailed."


The Ladies in White wrote letters to French Prime Minister
Dominique de Villepin, Pope Benedict XVI, Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi and Spanish King Juan Carlos to press the Cuban
government to release the prisoners.


Cuban leader Fidel Castro's regime accuses the men of being
"mercenaries at the service of a foreign power," allegedly the
United States.


The government has released 16 of the 75 prisoners rounded up in
the crackdown known as "Black Spring" for health reasons. The
government holds about 270 political prisoners, according to
dissidents.
