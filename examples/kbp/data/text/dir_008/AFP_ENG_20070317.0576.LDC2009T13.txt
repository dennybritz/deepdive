Juan Manuel Marquez took the World Boxing Council super
featherweight title from Marco Antonio Barrera, winning a
unanimous 12-round decision here Saturday in a showdown of
Mexican stars.


Marquez improved to 47-3 with one drawn on judges' scores of
118-109, 116-111 and 116-111. Barrera fell to 64-5, losing in his
fifth defense of the crown.


Marquez, who would like to set up a big-money bout against
Filipino superstar Manny Pacquiao, moved up a weight class to
challenge Barrera in a matchup of 33 -year-old ring veterans.


The title was not the first for Marquez, who took the World
Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation
featherweight titles in 2003.


Marquez stunned Barrera in the seventh round but Barrera knocked
him down with a solid right, then hit Marquez with another right
while he was on the mat.


That prompted referee Jay Nady to deduct a point from Barrera and
not give him credit for a knockdown.
