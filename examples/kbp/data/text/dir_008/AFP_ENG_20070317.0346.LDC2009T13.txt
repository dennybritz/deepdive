Reading and Portsmouth, chasing qualification for the UEFA Cup
next season, played out a goalless draw at the Madejski Stadium
here on Saturday.


This draw left Steve Coppell's Reading lying seventh on 44
points, one adrift of Spurs and two behind fifth-placed Bolton
who lost to Manchester United earlier Saturday.


Portsmouth are in ninth, two points below Coppell's highflyers.


Reading had the lion's share of the first half but it was
Portsmouth who went closest to grabbing the points only for
Richard Hughes's long range shot to strike the post with nine
minutes left on the clock.


Harry Redknapp's side had also been left rueing what might have
been before the break when Gary O'Neil's 20 yard volley dipped
inches over the crossbar.


Reading had their chances too, none more so than when Glenn
Little headed wide at the near post.


Coppell watched on anxiously 12 minutes from half-time when
Stephen Hunt fell awkwardly and received treatment to his ankle.


Portsmouth then had Sol Campbell to thank for a timely tackle
which denied Dave Kitson a gilt-edged goalscoring opportunity
from inside the six yard box.
