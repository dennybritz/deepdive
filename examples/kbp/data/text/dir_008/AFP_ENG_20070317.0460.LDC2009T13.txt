Several thousand demonstrators took to the streets of Los Angeles
here Saturday, joining a worldwide chorus of protest ahead of the
fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq.


Organizers of the rally in Hollywood estimated its size at "tens
of thousands," while the Los Angeles Police Department said the
figure was in the 5,000-6,000 range.


Protestors blew whistles and carried placards bearing slogans
critical of US President George W. Bush, such as "Worst President
Ever" and "It's time for regime change in Washington."


In bright sunshine and blue skies, marchers walked along
Hollywood Boulevard before staging a rally at the Hollywood and
Highland mall.


A smattering of celebrities were also marching in the crowd,
organizers said, including veteran actor and peace activist
Martin Sheen and actress Maria Bello, the star of "Thank you for
Smoking" and "A History of Violence."


Ron Kovic, the Vietnam War veteran who became famous through the
Oliver Stone film "Born on the Fourth of July", was also
participating, according to organizers.


Ian Thompson, of rally organisers ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War
& End Racism), said the protest was the biggest in Los
Angeles 2005. "People have had enough and this is their way of
showing it," Thompson told AFP.


"This government needs to start listening to what the people
want. And most people don't want us to be fighting war in Iraq,"
Thompson added.
