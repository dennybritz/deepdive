At least three Muslim students including a 12-year-old boy have
been killed after suspected separatist rebels launched an attack
on a school in Thailand's restive south, police said Sunday.


Local police chief Thammasak Wasasiri said an explosion hit the
Islamic school in Songkhla province on Saturday night, before
militants opened fire in the building.


"A 12-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl died at a scene while a
17-year-old male teenager died at hospital," Thammasak told AFP.
"Another seven students were injured."
