Paul Pierce scored 30 points and the Boston Celtics snapped a
10-year losing streak to San Antonio with a 91-85 victory over
the Spurs here Saturday.


Al Jefferson scored 20 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for the
Celtics, who had lost 18 games in a row to the Spurs since
beating them on January 8, 1997. They had not won in the Alamo
city since February 14, 1990.


Pierce, in his ninth season with Boston, had never played on a
Celtics team that beat the Spurs. Duncan, in his 10th season with
San Antonio, had never lost to the Celtics.


The Celtics led 77-64 with 11:24 to play before the Spurs
answered with a 29-8 run to seize an 85-83 lead on Tim Duncan's
basket with 94 seconds to play.


Pierce scored the next six points and the Celtics led 89-85 with
17 seconds to play, sealing the victory.


Duncan led the Spurs with 20 points, 16 rebounds and seven
blocked shots. San Antonio made only 28-of-75 shots from the
field.


The Spurs had won 13 games in a row but have lost to the two
worst teams in the Eastern Conference since.
