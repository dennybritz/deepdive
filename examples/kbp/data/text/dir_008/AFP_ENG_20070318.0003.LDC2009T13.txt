South Korea's antitrust watchdog said Sunday it would fine four
major local snack food makers for fixing prices of their ice
cream products.


The Fair Trade Commission said Lotte Confectionery, Lotte
Samkang, Haitai Confectionery and Binggrae would be fined a total
of 4.63 billion won (4.92 million dollars).


The commission accused the four of having colluded to raise the
prices of ice cream products since May 2005. It said its findings
would be referred to prosecutors for a criminal investigation.


The four companies control more than 80 percent of the country's
1.2 trillion won ice cream market.
