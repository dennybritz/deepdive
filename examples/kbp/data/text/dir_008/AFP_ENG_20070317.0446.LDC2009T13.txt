Indian captain Rahul Dravid admitted his team face a battle to
qualify for the next round of the World Cup after losing by five
wickets to Bangladesh here on Saturday.


"Our backs are up against the wall," said Dravid who chose to bat
at the Queen's Park Oval and saw his much-vaunted batting line-up
skittled out for just 191 by a young Bangladesh team.


"It was a disappointing day. We didn't get enough runs on the
board. I thought 240 would have been a good score but the wicket
surprised us," said Dravid.


"Their bowlers kept it really tight and they didn't let us get
away. We lost a few late wickets which could have been the
difference between 20 and 30 runs.


"With another 30-40 runs, it would have been a good game."


India will have to beat Sri Lanka as well as minnows Bermuda to
have any hope of making it through to the second round Super
Eights.


Bangladesh teenagers Tamim Iqbal, Saqibul Hasan and Mushfiqur
Rahim all made half-centuries to lead their country to their
famous win.


Chasing just 192, Bangladesh wrapped up the Group B match with
nine balls to spare.


Iqbal, aged just 17, hit 51 off 53 balls with 19-year-old Saqibul
making 53 off 86 balls.


Nineteen-year-old Mushfiqur Rahim made an unbeaten 56 off 107
balls to see his side home.


"I just tried to play my natural game," said Iqbal who collected
seven fours and two sixes.


"I like to play my shots."


Saqibul added: "It's a good win and we knew that if we could bat
50 overs we would win."


Man-of-the-match was seamer Mashrafe Mortaza who collected 4-38
to rock India.
