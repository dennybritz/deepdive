China does not have a history of doing well in synchronized
swimming but new coach Masayo Imura, from Japan, believes that is
about to change.


Imura, who for years spearheaded the Japanese national team in
the world of synchronized swimming, said she was confident about
her new role and predicted a strong future for the team.


"China doesn't have a history of synchronized swimming, it means
I can help the Chinese make new history. Now is the first day of
this history," she said at the World Swimming Championships here.


As coach Imura, 56, guided Japan to medals at all six Olympics
since synchronized swimming made its debut at the 1984 Los
Angeles Games.


She has been tasked by China to guide the team to a synchro medal
at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.


"I will show you how China is improving and can become powerful
at this championship. I think China is the centre of the world's
attention because of the Olympics and because of me," she said.


"They have the ability to chase Japan. They didn't know how to
catch up with Japan's level, so I will teach them the way."


Imura pinpointed identical 20-year-old twins Jiang Tingting and
Jiang Wenwen as potential stars who will challenge Russia, Spain
and Japan for the duet gold medal on Tuesday.


"They must have been put in this world to do synchronized
swimming. They are amazing," she said.


The pair won the duet gold and powered China to the team title at
the Asian Games in December, ending Japan's complete sweep of
golds since the sport was introduced to the regional event in
1994.
