Several of England's players at the World Cup have been fined for
a "breach of team discipline," it was announced Saturday.


In a statement, team spokesman Andy Walpole said the breach had
taken place here on Friday night following England's six-wicket
defeat by New Zealand in their opening Group C World Cup match
earlier in the day at the Beausejour Cricket Ground.


The breach was reported to the England team management at
breakfast time on Saturday and the decision to fine the players
involved taken at a subsequent team meeting, attended by the
whole squad and mangament, at noon local time.


Walpole, who refused to name the players involved, the extent of
their fines, or the exact nature of the breach, said in a
statement: "The England team management today (Saturday)
announced that a number of England players had been fined by the
head coach, Duncan Fletcher, after admitting to a breach of team
discipline last (Friday) night.


"The decision followed a team meeting at noon today (Saturday)
which was attended by all the players and management."


England's next Group C match is against Canada on Sunday.
