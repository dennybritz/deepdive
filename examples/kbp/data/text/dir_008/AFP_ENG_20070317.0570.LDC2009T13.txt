South Korea's Lee Bong-Ju ran past Kenya's Paul Kiprop Kirui in a
late burst to win the Seoul International Marathon on Sunday.


The 37-year-old spurted in the last 1.5 kilometres, crossing the
finishing line with a time of 2 hours, 8 minutes, 4 seconds.


The race was led by Lee and three runners from Kenya, with Kirui
making a charge after 36 kilometres.


Kirui finished second in 2:08:29, followed by his countryman
Laban Kipkemboi who came third in 2:08:38.


China's Wei Yanan won the women's race in 2:23:12.


It was Lee's first international marathon victory since he won
the 2001 Boston Marathon. He earned 80,000 dollars plus a 10,000
dollars bonus.


"I am satisfied with my record which helped me regain my
confidence," Lee said.


"When Kirui started picking up speed, I knew he could not keep
running at such a pace. I believed I could catch up with him
unless I fell far behind."
