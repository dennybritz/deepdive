Insurgents killed three people, including a policeman, in two
separate incidents early Sunday in Baghdad despite a massive
security crackdown in the Iraqi capital, security officials said.


A policeman and a civilian were killed and five policemen wounded
when a roadside bomb struck a police patrol near the renowned Al-
Mustansiriyah University in east Baghdad, a security official
with the defence ministry said.


Iraqi security forces are often targeted by insurgents in an
attempt to destabilise the country's security situation, while
the university itself has also been attacked a number of times in
the past.


Another civilian was killed and one wounded in a mortar attack in
central Baghdad's Al-Fadhel district, another security official
said.


Insurgents and militiamen have managed to carry out attacks in
Baghdad despite the presence of 90,000 US and Iraqi troops on the
city's streets as part of Operation Fardh al-Qanoon (Imposing
Law) launched to curb the violence.


US military commanders however claim that violence has been
falling in Baghdad since the operation was launched on February
14.
