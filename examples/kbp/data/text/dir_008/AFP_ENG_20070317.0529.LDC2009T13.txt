Four years after the US-led invasion of Iraq, tens or even
hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are known to have died violently,
while almost 3,500 members of the coalition have also perished.


Approximate death toll by country:


- Iraqis: A study by US researchers published in October last
year estimated that some 655,000 Iraqi civilians had died since
the start of the occupation.


A report published a month later by the Iraqi authorities put the
figure at 150,000, while the British web site Iraqbodycount,
based on press reports, puts it at between 59,000 and just under
65,000 as of mid-March this year.


The Iraqi security forces say they have lost some 12,000 members.


Military casualties suffered by coalition nations:


- United States: 3,211 as of Friday, according to an AFP count
based on Pentagon figures.


- Britain: 133 soldiers.


- Italy: 32, of whom 17 died in a single attack in 2003.


- Ukraine: 18


- Poland: 19


- Bulgaria 13


- Spain: 11


- Denmark: six


- El Salvador: five


- Slovakia: four


- Latvia: three


- Estonia: two


- Thailand: two


- The Netherlands: two


- The Czech Republic: one


- Kazakhstan: one


- Australia: one


- Hungary: one


- Romania: one


Of the countries listed, the following have now withdrawn all
their forces from Iraq: Spain, Thailand, the Netherlands,
Hungary, Ukraine, Italy and Slovakia.


NB: A number of the coalition deaths listed were due to accidents
and suicides rather than hostile action.
