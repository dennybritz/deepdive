Sheffield United face a potentially nervy end to the season after
losing top scorer Rob Hulse to a broken leg he suffered during
the 3-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday.


The loss left Neil Warnock's side only seven points clear of the
relegation zone and that cushion could be cut to four if Charlton
can beat Newcastle at The Valley on Sunday.


Hulse, who has scored eight times this season, suffered the
injury in a goalmouth collision with Chelsea goalkeeper Petr
Cech.


Manager Neil Warnock said: "It looks like a double fracture. It
was pretty horrific - one of those where you look away.


"He almost got the ball but his ankle collided with Cech's leg,
goes one way and then goes the other way. It was horrible to look
at.


"We know we now have a job on our hands and it is up to one of
the other lads to take us on from what Rob has done for us.
Somebody else has to find the goals to keep us in the division."
