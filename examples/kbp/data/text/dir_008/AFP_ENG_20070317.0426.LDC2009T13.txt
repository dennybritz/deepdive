Two-time French Open champ Rafael Nadal defeated Andy Roddick
6-4, 6-3 in the semi-final of the ATP/WTA Pacific Life Open on
Saturday.


Nadal moves to Sunday's final where he will play the winner of
the match between Serbia's Novak Djokovic and Scotland's Andy
Murray.


Nadal, of Spain, has not won an ATP title since Roland Garros,
going winless in 12 consecutive tournaments.


Nadal had 33 winners, six aces and 12 unforced errors to
Roddick's 22 winners, 16 aces and 15 unforced errors in the one
hour 13 minute match at the main Indian Wells Tennis Garden
stadium.


Nadal put on an impressive display of shot-making in front of a
crowd of 12,000 and served at 87 percent compared to Roddick's 58
percent.


Nadal broke Roddick's serve three times in the match. Heading
into the semis, Roddick had gone 45 service games without facing
a break point on his serve.


Roddick faced the first break point on his serve of the
tournament in the fifth game of the first set. He would be broken
again twice in the second.


Nadal clinched the set on his first match point when Roddick hit
a passing shot into the net.


Nadal now has a 2-1 lead in career meetings against Roddick but
it had been two years since they last played.


Nadal and Roddick had not played since the 2004 Davis Cup final,
where Nadal avenged a loss to Roddick in the US Open two months
earlier with a four-set victory.
