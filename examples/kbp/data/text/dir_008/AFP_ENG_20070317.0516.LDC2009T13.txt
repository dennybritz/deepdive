Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson apologised to Watford's Ben
Foster for the 'freak' goal that embarrassed his England rival.


Robinson left Foster red-faced when he scored Tottenham's second
goal in  their 3-1 win over Watford on Saturday. The England
number one launched a free-kick from deep in his own half that
bounced over Foster and into the net.


The match had been billed as a battle of the top two English
goalkeepers and Foster, who has been earning rave reviews this
season, was expected to underline his case to unseat Robinson.


But Foster's 63rd minute mistake means England coach Steve
McClaren is likely to keep the on-loan Manchester United stopper
on the sidelines for the forthcoming Euro 2008 qualifiers against
Israel and Andorra.


However, Robinson insists he will go easy on Foster when they
meet up for England duty next week.


He said: "I will try not to mention it. I know what it's like and
it's not nice.


"It was a bit of a freak. If it goes wide I would probably have
got a telling off from the strikers - it's just one of those
things in football."
