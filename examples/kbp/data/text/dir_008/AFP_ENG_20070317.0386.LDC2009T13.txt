Portugal's public deficit for 2006 will be lower than the 4.6
percent of gross domestic product initially forecast by the
government, Prime Minister Jose Socrates said on Saturday.


"The available data, which are still provisional, let us know
that the deficit for that year will be lower than the government
prediction," he told a meeting of his Socialist party in Lisbon.


He gave no new estimate for the 2006 public estimate but earlier
on Saturday weekly newspaper Expresso, citing unnamed sources,
reported the government would soon announce a public deficit of
4.1 percent of GDP for last year.


Portugal posted a public deficit of 6.0 percent of GDP in 2005 --
double the 3.0 percent limit imposed on the 13 countries that use
the euro currency.


The national statistics institute will release its public deficit
figures for 2006 at the end of the month.


Socrates has raised taxes, stepped up the fight against tax
evasion and cut benefits for public workers since coming to power
in March 2005 in an effort to bring the deficit below the EU
limit by the end of 2008.


Portugal's public deficit is forecast to fall from 3.7 percent
this year to 2.6 percent next year.
