Jordan welcomed the creation of a Palestinian government of
national unity on Saturday and said Amman hoped the move would
bring about the lifting of the year-old Western aid freeze.


"The investiture of the Palestinian unity government ...
constitutes an important step, particularly in the critical
situation that the Palestinian people are going through," said
government spokesman Nasser Judeh, quoted by the official Petra
news agency.


"Jordan hopes the new Palestinian government will be able to
shoulder its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people and
serve their interests, notably in achieving the lifting of the
embargo imposed on them."


The Palestinian parliament on Saturday swore in the government
formed by the secular Fatah movement and Islamist Hamas after
weeks of wrangling and bloodshed in which scores died in fighting
between militants of the two sides.


The aid freeze was imposed when Hamas took power a year ago after
a shock victory over Fatah in democratic elections.
