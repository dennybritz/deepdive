An investigation has been launched into how 10 people detained by
British forces in southern Iraq escaped by switching places with
visitors, Britain's Ministry of Defence said Saturday.


The 10 detainees were found to be missing on Thursday from the
Shuaiba military base in the southern Iraqi city of Basra where
they had been held as a "threat to security" but had not been
convicted of any crimes, a ministry spokesman said.


"Indications are that they swapped clothes and changed places
with their visitors earlier in the week," a spokesman said. "A
comprehensive investigation into the incident is under way."


With monitoring levels varying widely between facilities,
thousands are held in US and British-run prisons across Iraq if
they are considered to pose a potential threat to security.
