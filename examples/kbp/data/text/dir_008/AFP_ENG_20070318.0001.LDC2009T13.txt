North Korea said an upcoming joint US-South Korea military
exercise was a provocation that proves Washington is only waiting
for a chance to invade the communist country.


"This is an unpardonable military provocation as it indicates
that the US seeks an ulterior aim behind the curtain of
dialogue," the North's official Korean Central News Agency said
in a commentary late Saturday.


The joint drills are due to begin on March 25, with hundreds of
thousands of South Korean troops and some 29,000 US soldiers
based here and abroad taking part, along with a US aircraft
carrier backed by cruisers and destroyers.


South Korea and the United States have defended the annual
exercise as being purely defensive.


The commentary hit out at the United States for carrying out the
exercise while negotiations are under way with Pyongyang as part
of the six-nation talks over the secretive North's nuclear
programmes.


"The reality goes to prove that the US is only watching for a
chance to invade the DPRK (North Korea), refusing to abandon its
attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, though it is talking
about dialogue.


"Dialogue and war manoeuvres can never go together," it said.


North Korea is "fully prepared to deal merciless crushing blows
at the aggressors, not forgetting the US arrogant nature even a
moment," it said.
