A Sri Lankan defence official said the navy sank a ship of the
eastern coast Sunday that was believed to be smuggling weapons
for Tamil Tiger rebels.


Sri Lankan naval craft shelled the ship after it failed to stop
for an inspection, a defence official said, adding the ship was
similar to one also destroyed by the navy on February 28 off the
island's southern coast.


"We suspect it was a large boat carrying weapons for the Tigers,"
the  defence official, who declined to be named, said.


There have been increasing clashes between suspected Tamil Tiger
ships and the Sri Lankan navy in recent months amid heavy
fighting in the island's northern and eastern regions.
