Bangladesh teenagers Tamim Iqbal and Saqibul Hasan led their
country to a famous five-wicket win over India in a World Cup
sensation here on Saturday.


Chasing just 192 to win, Bangladesh wrapped up the Group B match
at the Queen's Park Oval with nine balls to spare.


Iqbal, aged just 17, hit 51 off 53 balls with 19-year-old Saqibul
making 53 off 86 balls.


Mushfiqur Rahim made an unbeaten 56 off 107 balls to see his side
home.


"I just tried to play my natural game," said Iqbal who collected
seven fours and two sixes.  "I like to play my shots."


Saqibul added: "It's a good win and we knew that if we could bat
50 overs we would win."
