European synchronised swimmers excelled in the solo free
preliminaries on Sunday, with French star Virginie Dedieu making
a stunning return to competition by posting a near-perfect score.


Dedieu, enticed out of retirement for the World Swimming
Championships, was awarded three perfect marks of 10 for her
routine for an overall score of 99 to position herself as the top
qualifer for the final on Thursday.


The 28-year-old, whose routine is based on the life of opera diva
Maria Callas, moved through the water with power and flexibility
as she chases an unprecedented third consecutive solo gold medal.


Spain's Gemma Mengual Civil, known as the Princess of Barcelona,
followed Dedieu in the water and mirrored the Frenchwoman's
style. Mengual was intense, passionate and dramatic in her
complex routine to finish in third (97.667).


Russia's Natalia Ischenko, who won silver behind Dedieu at the
last world championships in Montreal, scored one perfect 10 for
her routine and finished second with 98.500.


Despite being technically exceptional, Japan's Saho Harada lacked
the presence of the top three but still produced a high score for
fourth place and a spot in the final.


The world junior champion, Huang Xuechen of China, impressed with
her graceful movements as the 17-year-old performed in a swan-
inspired white swimsuit to show why she is seen as an upcoming
star of the sport.
