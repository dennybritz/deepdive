Cato June became the third free agent to leave the Super Bowl
champion Indianapolis Colts, the linebacker signing with the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers here Saturday.


June made a career-high 142 tackles last season plus three
interceptions, a quarterback sack and forced two fumbles in
helping the Colts capture their first National Football League
title since 1970.


The 27-year-old defender made seven tackles in the Colts' 29-17
victory over Chicago in Super Bowl 41 last month.


June's departure from Indianapolis follows those of cornerback
Nick Harper, who signed with Tennessee on Wednesday, and running
back Dominic Rhodes, who signed with Oakland last Friday.


The sixth-round pick in the 2003 NFL Draft has 399 career tackles
and 10 interceptions in 56 NFL games.
