North Korea will take part in an international conference on
Asian women forced into sexual slavery during World War II,
organisers said Sunday.


The conference on the so-called "comfort women" will take place
in Seoul on May 19-21, said the Korean Council for the Women
Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.


North Korea has sent a letter saying it would send five delegates
to the meeting which also involves Taiwan, the Philippines,
Indonesia, East Timor, Australia and the United States, the
council said.


It was not known whether the North Korean delegation would
include comfort women, it said.


Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe caused outrage earlier this
month when he said there was no evidence that "comfort women"
were forced into sexual slavery "in the strict sense of
coercion."


His remarks have provoked a furore in Asian countries that were
invaded by Japan and in the United States, where the US Congress
is considering a bill that would demand Japan make an outright
apology to the women.


Historians say up to 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea but
also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan, were
forced to serve as sex slaves in Japanese army brothels.
