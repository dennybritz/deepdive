Wales escaped the dreaded Six Nations wooden spoon here on
Saturday as they beat world champions England 27-18 in their
final match of this year's tournament.


France had all but retained the Six Nations title earlier as they
beat Scotland 46-19 in their final match of the championship.


The French only scraped through to the title with an injury-time
try by Elvis Vermuelen as they needed to beat the Scots by more
than 24 points to edge out the Irish, who had earlier beaten
Italy 51-24.
