Brunei's Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah Bolkiah has become a
father with the birth of his first-born, a baby boy, by his half-
Swiss wife, the sultanate announced.


The future king's wife, Sarah Salleh, gave birth to the boy on
Saturday at 3:50 pm (0750 GMT) and his birth was celebrated with
a 19-gun salute, the government said.


The crown prince, who turned 33 last month, married his wife, 20,
in 2004 in one of the grandest weddings in Asia in more than a
decade. It was his first marriage.


She is the third child of a Bruneian civil servant and Swiss-born
psychiatric nurse, Suzanne Aeby of Fribourg, who met while
studying in London in the 1970s.


Energy-rich Brunei draws its wealth from oil and gas reserves,
and its ruler, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, was once reputed to be
the world's richest man before the rise of technology mogul Bill
Gates and other self-made billionaires.
