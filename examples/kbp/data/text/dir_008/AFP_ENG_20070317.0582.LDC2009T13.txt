Kimi Raikkonen of Finland won the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday
driving a Ferrari, with defending world champion Fernando Alonso
of Spain second in his McLaren.


Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain was third in another McLaren.


Raikkonen, in his first drive for Ferrari as a replacement for
retired seven- times world champion Michael Schumacher, dominated
the opening race of the season.


Ferrari employed a two-stop pits strategy throughout the 58 laps
to beat Alonso by 7.2 seconds with rookie Hamilton, driving in
his first GP, coming in third another 11.3 seconds away.


It was the 27-year-old Finn's 10th win in 105 career GPs after he
started off the pole as fastest qualifier.


Raikkonen's win was Ferrari's sixth victory in the last nine
Australian GPs and ended a run of two Australian wins by
defending constructors' champions Renault.


German Nick Heidfeld in a BMW-Sauber was fourth with Renault's
Giancarlo Fisichella of Italy fifth.


Brazilian Felipe Massa, who started off the eighth row on the
grid in the second Ferrari car, worked his way through the field
to finish sixth.
