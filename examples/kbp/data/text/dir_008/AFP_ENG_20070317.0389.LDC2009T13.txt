Two people were killed and thousands left homeless when a ruinous
cyclone smashed the northern coast of Madagascar, authorities
said Saturday.


Cyclone "Indlala" left a trail of devastation in its wake on
Thursday, damaging buildings and infrastructure on the Indian
Ocean island.


The deaths occurred in the village of Antalaha, 570 kilometres
(354 miles) north of the capital Antananarivo, said Jacky
Randriaharison, national emergencies chief.


"The provisional toll from Indlala is 2,850 homeless, but this
number will rise," Randriaharison said, adding that there had
been considerable material damage.


A national electricity power station 160 kilometres east of
Antananarivo was damaged, seriously limiting its output. Repairs
are scheduled for next week.


Indlala is the sixth cyclone to hit the island since the
beginning of December. Cyclone season on the island runs between
December and March.


Two people were killed on December 26 when Cyclone Bondo reached
the southwestern Menabe region.
