ACT Brumbies captain Stirling Mortlock is expected to miss up to
six weeks of the Super 14 rugby tournament after breaking his
hand during his side's 38-20 loss to the Central Cheetahs, a team
spokesman said Sunday.


X-rays taken after Saturday's match in Bloemfontein confirmed
that the Wallaby outside centre had broken the third and fourth
metacarpal in his right hand after contesting a kick-off in the
36th minute, the spokesman said.


Mortlock has been in the wars this season and had only recently
returned from two bouts of concussion from head knocks.


It continues a run of injuries in the Brumbies' ranks with star
Wallaby fly-half Stephen Larkham recovering from a chest injury.
