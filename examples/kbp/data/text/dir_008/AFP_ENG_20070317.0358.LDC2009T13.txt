A strong 6.1-magnitude earthquake hit off Indonesia's northern
Moluccas islands on Sunday, geologists said.


There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.


The quake struck at 1.42 am (1742 GMT), 126 kilometres (78 miles)
northwest of Ternate, in the Moluccas islands, the US Geological
Survey said.


The USGS said the quake struck at a depth of 6 kilometres.


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where
continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and volcanic
activity.
