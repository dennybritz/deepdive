A plane carrying Australian Prime Minister John Howard was forced
to make an emergency landing in Iraq after the cabin began to
fill with smoke shortly after take-off, reports said Sunday.


Howard was on a secret visit to southern Iraq on Saturday when
the RAAF C-130 Hercules was forced back to Tallil airbase.


The plane, which was carrying 30 people including the head of the
Australian defence force Air Marshal Angus Houston, filled with
smoke soon after taking off from Tallil.


The pilot turned the plane around as it reached an altitude of
about 1,500 metres (4,900 feet), forcing passengers to wear
oxygen masks as the plane dropped into a rapid descent.


Reporters travelling with the prime minister said Howard appeared
relaxed after the incident.


"I'm fine. I was in very good hands. You can't get any better
than the RAAF," he said.


"It was a really good performance, and I want to thank everyone."


Howard, who last week visited Australian troops in Afghanistan,
boarded a second plane 20 minutes after the incident and
continued his trip to Baghdad.
