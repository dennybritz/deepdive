Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon was preparing to
travel this week to Bangladesh to discuss the current political
deadlock and possible aid for elections, his office said Sunday.


The trip to Dhaka from Tuesday to Thursday will be followed by
one to India where he will meet Indian leaders and speak at a
conference that aims to narrow the digital divide between rich
and poor countries.


In Bangladesh, McKinnon will discuss "the current political
situation" with the caretaker government's chief advisor
Fakhruddin Ahmed and other members of the non-party caretaker
government, his office said in a statement.


He will also meet with political leaders and the chief electoral
commissioner to discuss preparations for the postponed elections
and "possible Commonwealth assistance in that regard."


Bangladesh's general elections were scheduled to be held on
January 22 but were cancelled amid a row over alleged vote-
rigging.


Visiting India from Thursday to Saturday, McKinnon will meet
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Commerce and Industry Minister
Kamal Nath, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and the minister of
state for external affairs, Shri E Ahamed.


On Friday, he will speak about 21st century challenges at the
Indian Council of World Affairs.


He will speak Saturday to the Commonwealth Connects International
e-Partnership Summit in Delhi, which aims to bridge the digital
divide.
