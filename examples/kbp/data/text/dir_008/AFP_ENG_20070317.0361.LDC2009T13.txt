Poland's quadruple world ski jump champion Adam Malysz grabbed
the lead in the hunt for the World Cup title with his sixth
succcess of the season here on Saturday.


The 29-year-old recorded jumps of 131 and 122 metres to win and
move 22 points clear of Anders Jacobsen of Norway in the World
Cup standings with four events remaining.


Malysz was followed by Switzerland's Andreas Kuttel and Anders
Bardal of Norway in this event, which replaced Friday's cancelled
jump at Lillehammer.


Jacobsen, who has been in the lead in the race for the 2007 title
since the start of the season, could only manage 14th.


With this 35th career win, Malysz nudged closer to Maatti
Nykaenen of Finland's record 46 World Cup successes.
