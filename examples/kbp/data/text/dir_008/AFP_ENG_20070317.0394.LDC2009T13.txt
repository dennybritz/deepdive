France retained the Six Nations title here on Saturday as they
beat Scotland 46-19 in their final match of the tournament.


The French only scraped through to the title with an injury-time
try by Elvis Vermuelen as they need to beat the Scots by more
than 24 points to edge out the Irish, who had earlier beaten
Italy 51-24.


World champions England could have in theory won the title but
they slumped to a 27-18 defeat by Wales in the final match of the
whole tournament.


France's inspirational captain Raphael Ibanez said that it was a
wonderful feeling to have the trophy in his hands, even, though,
somewhat bizarrely he and the team were presented it in an empty
Stade de France after England lost to Wales.


"It is a great feeling," said the 87-times capped Wasps hooker.


"We showed real character by bouncing back after the England
defeat so hats off to them.


"We always knew it would be a tight tournament and a huge fight
between us and the Irish, so this is a pretty emotional moment
for us."
