Defending champions Australia received a further boost on
Saturday when all- rounder Andrew Symonds turned his arm over for
the first time following surgery last month.


The 31-year-old bowled in the nets during practice on the eve of
their Group A match against the Netherlands here on Sunday, a
game from which he has  already been ruled out by team physio
Alex Kountouris.


"Symonds has made really solid progress. I think he is right on
track. But when he gets back to playing an actual game, I'm not
sure when that is," vice-captain Adam Gilchrist told reporters on
Saturday.


Symonds was included in the 15-man World Cup squad despite
injuring his bicep during the tri-series in Australia last month.


He completed his first batting training in St Vincent last week
by facing tennis balls in the nets, and has been batting with the
hard ball this week.


However, he hasn't thrown the ball as a fielder.


Kountouris hopes that Symonds's best chance of playing for the
first time will come in the crunch match against Group A rivals
South Africa on March 24, a contest which will decide who tops
the group.
