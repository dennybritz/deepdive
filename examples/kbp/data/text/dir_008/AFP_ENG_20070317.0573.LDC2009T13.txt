Artillery duels raged in Sri Lanka's embattled northern and
eastern regions Sunday forcing more civilians to flee their
homes, the two sides said.


Troops and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) guerrillas
traded long- range attacks in the northern and eastern regions
where at least six troops and one guerrilla were killed on Friday
night.


The LTTE said Sunday that security forces were attacking
territory held by them and the guerrillas were retaliating in
kind.


"Sporadic artillery exchange is reported at Mannar, Vavuniya,
Manalaru and along the northern forward defence line of Vanni,"
LTTE spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said in a statement.


The military said it lost six soldiers killed and 30 wounded
since Friday, while the Tigers placed their losses at one killed
and several others wounded.


The defence ministry in a statement claimed that troops had
killed more Tiger rebels in the artillery exchanges.


Artillery exchanges in the east of the island have prompted more
people to leave their homes.


Government officials said a total of 155,568 people had been
internally displaced in the district of Batticaloa in the past
month and more people were moving to the safety of state-run
relief shelters.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
since December 2005 despite a truce that has been in place, at
least on paper, since February 2002.
