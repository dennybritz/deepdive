Former world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield kept his
comeback bid going here Saturday with a third-round stoppage of
fellow American Vinny Maddalone.


Holyfield won for the third time in seven months, improving to
41-8 with two drawn with his 27th victory inside the distance
2:48 into the third round when Maddalone trainer Al Certa asked
for the fight to be stopped.


The 44-year-old ex-champion beat Jeremy Bates last August and
Fres Oquendo last November and battered Maddalone, who suffered a
gash on his forehead on a first- round incidental head-butt and
fell to 27-4.


"They run into my head and I've been accused of head-butting when
they're head- butting me," Holyfield said. "He kept leading with
his head. ... I knew that was a distraction so I kept going at
it."


Holyfield was idle for nearly two years after a 12-round loss to
Larry Donald after a medical suspension but has fought three
times in Texas since the ban was lifted.


"I'm ready for a championship fight," Holyfield said.


Holyfield will turn 45 in October, the same age as Foreman was
when he stopped Michael Moorer to regain the heavyweight title.


Holyfield has denied a report linking him to a steroids
investigation. Federal agents told Times-Union newspaper of
Albany, New York that Holyfield used the name "Evan Fields" when
ordering from a Mobile, Alabama, pharmacy.
