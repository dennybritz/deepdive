Former world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield kept his
comeback bid going here Saturday with a third-round stoppage of
fellow American Vinny Maddalone.


The 44-year-old four-time ex-champ won for the third time in
seven months, improving to 41-8 with two drawn with his 27th
victory inside the distance. Holyfield beat Jeremy Bates last
August and Fres Oquendo last November.


Holyfield was idle for nearly two years after a 12-round loss to
Larry Donald after a medical suspension but has fought three
times in Texas since the ban was lifted and kept his dream alive
by dumping Maddalone, who fell to 27-4.


Holyfield has denied a report linking him to a steroids
investigation. Federal agents told Times-Union newspaper of
Albany, New York that Holyfield used the name "Evan Fields" when
ordering from a Mobile, Alabama, pharmacy.


Holyfield will turn 45 in October, the same age as Foreman was
when he stopped Michael Moorer to regain the heavyweight title.
