South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Sunday for closer
defence ties with France at his meeting with visiting French
Defence Minister Michele Alliot- Marie.


At the meeting, Roh said the two countries should step up efforts
to boost military cooperation, his office said in a statement.


Roh and Alliot-Marie also discussed regional security such as
North Korea's nuclear weapons programme and inter-Korean
relations, it said.


Alliot-Marie, who arrived here Friday, expressed hope that her
visit would promote "military exchanges and cooperation in
defence industries" between the two countries, it said.


The French minister visited Panmunjon, a truce village in the
demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas, before departing
for China on the last leg of her tour of Northeast Asia.
