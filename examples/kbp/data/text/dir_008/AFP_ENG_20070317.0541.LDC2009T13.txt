Britain's opposition Conservatives have strengthened their lead
over the governing Labour Party by a percentage point since last
month, a poll showed Sunday.


The YouGov survey published in The Sunday Times showed that the
Conservatives of the young and charismatic David Cameron had 38
percent support from voters, compared to 32 percent for Labour.


The boost comes before Cameron speaks at his party's spring
conference.


The survey also showed that the gap would be even wider if, as
expected, finance minister Gordon Brown succeeds Prime Minister
Tony Blair who has pledged to step down by September.


Some 41 percent of those surveyed would vote for Cameron, and
just 31 percent for Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer.


More than half believed Brown would do badly if he becomes
leader, while 31 percent were positive about his prospects.


However, Cameron did not do much better as 43 percent feared he
would perform badly as prime minister, compared to 37 percent who
thought he would do well.


With the budget imminent, the Conservatives also enjoyed the
trust of voters on economic competence.


Asked who they most believed to raise their standard of living,
36 percent said the Conservatives, against 29 percent for Labour.


Nearly two thirds agreed with the statement that Brown had
"raised taxes in a sneaky way and I don't really trust him."


And just under two-thirds held the view that much of the
government's extra investment in public services had been wasted.
