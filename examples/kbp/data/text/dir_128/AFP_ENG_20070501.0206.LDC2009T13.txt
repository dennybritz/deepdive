Iran is ready to have "discussions" with the United States
although the time is not right for negotiations, Deputy Foreign
Minister Mehdi Mostafavi said Tuesday ahead of the Iraq security
conference, the ISNA news agency reported.


"The United States cannot have this hostile attitude and say on
the other hand that they are favourable to negotiations," he
said.


"But we can can have discussions, just as (President Mahmoud)
Ahmadinejad said he was ready to have a televised debate with
(President George W.) Bush," he said, referring to an offer that
was rejected by the White House last year.


Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki will be attending the
international conference on Iraq's security in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on May 3-4 after Tehran overcame
its initial reluctance and decided to attend.


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will be representing
Washington, building expectations of bilateral talks between the
two top diplomats that would be the first since the United States
broke off diplomatic relations in 1980.
