Vietnamese police have broken up a ring that trafficked young
women to Malaysia, where they were promised jobs but instead were
married off to local men, a media report said Tuesday.


The ring was uncovered after one of the women escaped, said the
state-controlled Thanh Nien (Young People) newspaper.


Police last Saturday arrested four organisers, women aged 33 to
44, in Tay Ninh province who over the past year used fake labour
permits to dupe 11 women and send them via middlemen to new
husbands in Malaysia, the report said.


Tens of thousands of Vietnamese women and children are trafficked
every year -- mostly to China and Cambodia but also Taiwan,
Thailand, Singapore and South Korea -- according to past surveys
by the ministry of public security.


UNICEF says the victims, 98 percent of whom are female, are
mostly trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced marriages
but also for forced labour, servitude and sometimes for adoption
and the removal of organs.
