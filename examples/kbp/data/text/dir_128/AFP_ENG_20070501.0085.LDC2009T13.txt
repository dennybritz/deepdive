Riot police fired into the air in the southern Chinese territory
of Macau as a May Day street protest turned violent Tuesday and
officers scuffled with demonstrators in rare scenes of civil
unrest.


Officers opened fire with what were thought to be starter pistols
after the crowd of more than 1,000, protesting against labour
shortages and conditions, broke through police cordons lining the
march route.


Cheered by watching residents, they then began marching toward
government offices.


Witnesses said they saw several protesters being dragged from the
crowd by their hair by baton-wielding police while another man
was seen staggering away clutching a wound to his face.


There were reports from some, however, that police had fired live
rounds.


"I know what a starter pistol sounds like and they were not
firing blanks," said lawmaker Jose Pereira Coutinho.


The protest started peacefully with demonstrators calling on the
government to implement laws to reduce the number of illegal
workers flooding into Macau to cash in on a recent casino-led
economic boom.


But the mood turned when they reached a mortuary where the city's
political leader Edmund Ho was mourning his father, who died
recently.


They began chanting "Edmund Ho step down," and scuffles broke out
as police tried to move the crowd along.
