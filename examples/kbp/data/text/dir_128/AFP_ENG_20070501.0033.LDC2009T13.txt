At least 1,689 Iraqis were killed in April in the country's
various vicious conflicts, nearly a fifth fewer than in the
previous month, according to figures compiled by government
ministries.


The persistent bloodshed claimed the lives of 63 soldiers, 128
police and 1,498 civilians -- a death toll 19 percent lower than
that in March -- according to records from the defence, interior
and health ministries seen by AFP.


Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government no longer issues
official casualty statistics and has refused to give figures to
United Nations human rights monitors, who can no longer confirm
the reports.


Nevertheless, the leaked figures showed the death toll declining
despite a spectacular spate of car bombings in recent weeks.


On February 14, Maliki launched a joint US-Iraqi security
operation in Baghdad, the epicentre of the sectarian war pitting
Shiite and Sunni factions against one another and a target of
Iraq's violent insurgency.


Since then, according to US commanders, death squad murders have
dropped by around two-thirds, offsetting the continuing high rate
of bomb attacks.


Tuesday's figures also showed that Iraqi forces had killed 219
"terrorists" and captured 2,939, significantly down from the 481
killed in March.
