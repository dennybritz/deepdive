Most major European markets were shut for a public holiday on
Tuesday with the exception of London, where the FTSE 100 index of
leading shares drifted lower in initial deals.


The British capital's FTSE showed a modest fall of 0.08 percent
to 6,444.30 points.


European stock markets were closed for the day in Amsterdam,
Frankfurt, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan, Paris and Zurich.


In US deals on Monday, stocks had fallen as investors paused
following a record- setting series of sessions and locked in
gains on the final day of the best month for Wall Street in over
three years.
