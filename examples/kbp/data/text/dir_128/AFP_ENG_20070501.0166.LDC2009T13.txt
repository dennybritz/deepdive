Environmental crusader and former US vice president Al Gore is
scheduled to visit Taiwan in September to promote awareness of
global warming, organisers here said Tuesday.


Gore was expected to give two speeches, in the capital Taipei and
southern Kaohsiung city, and attend a forum in Yushan National
Park, said lawmaker and environmentalist Tien Chiu-chin, an
organiser of the event.


The trip would tentatively take place between September 13-20,
but it was yet to be decided how many days Gore would stay in
Taiwan, Tien's office said.


Tien is planning to set up a non-profit organisation called
"Friends of Al Gore in Taiwan" to raise awareness of global
warming here and raise funds for Gore's trip.


Since his failed 2000 presidential bid, Gore has positioned
himself as a champion of environmental issues, promoting
awareness of climate change.


His documentary on global warming, "An Inconvenient Truth,"
received an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards.
