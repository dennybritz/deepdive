Iraqi authorities are investigating reports that the alleged
leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, has been killed
in a struggle within his own group, the interior ministry said
Tuesday.


"There is intelligence information. Some information, you know,
needs confirmations, but this information is very strong,"
interior ministry operations director Brigadier General Abdel
Karim Khalaf said.


"The clashes took place among themselves. There were clashes
within the groups of Al-Qaeda. He was liquidated by them. Our
forces had nothing to do with it," he added, in an interview on
state television.


A US military spokesman could not confirm the report.
