Small bombs exploded at three railway stations in Bangladesh on
Tuesday, including one in the capital Dhaka, but there were no
reports of casualties, police said.


Railway officials said leaflets possibly linked to the bombings
were found at two stations. One of them called for a break in
relations with a minority group of Muslims frequently targeted by
Islamic extremists.


"The bombs went off at about 7:00 am (0100 GMT). They created
panic but no one was injured, a police official told AFP. They
targeted stations in Dhaka, the northern city of Sylhet and the
southeastern city of Chittagong.


One leaflet found said "We are ready to die" and another called
to cut ties with the Ahmadiyas.


Muslim Bangladesh's Ahmadiya community is frequently targeted by
extremists in the majority Sunni community who have called on the
government to pass a law declaring them "non-Muslim."


Ahmadiyas break sharply with mainstream Islam by not believing
that Mohammad was the last prophet.


In August 2005, more than 400 explosive devices were detonated
almost simultaneously in towns and cities across Bangladesh.
Leaflets found at previous bombing sites have called for the
imposition of strict Islamic law.
