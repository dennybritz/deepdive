A group of 49 Japanese magicians sued two television networks
here Tuesday for showing how coin tricks are done in their news
programmes.


In an unprecedented suit filed with the Tokyo District Court,
they demanded 1,970,000 yen (16,400 dollars) in damages, and
apologies from the Nippon Television Network Corp. and TV Asahi
Corp.


The two networks exposed the secrets of coin tricks last
November, after a magician and a pub operator were arrested for
punching holes in coins for use in a sleight-of-hand.


There is a law in Japan against damaging or melting coins.


Nippon TV demonstrated a trick, in which a cigarette appeared to
penetrate a coin, and revealed its secret. TV Asahi also showed
how another coin trick was done.


"There was no need to reveal the secrets of tricks and the
defendants infringed upon the value of secrets of tricks, which
are assets shared by magicians," the group said in the lawsuit.


Professional magician Shintaro Fujiyama, 52, one of the
plaintiffs, told reporters, "It takes us many years to develop a
coin trick as a professional tool. They must understand how all
the time we have spent is wasted by exposure of the trick."


TV Asahi said it believed there was no problem in the news
programme. Nippon TV declined to comment.
