Attacks killed 25 people across Iraq on Tuesday, including 11
people shot dead in a minibus headed south from Baghdad to the
mainly Shiite provincial capital of Hilla.


"The bus was carrying people to Hilla from Baghdad and was
attacked as it passed Iskandiriyah," police Lieutenant Haider al-
Lami said. "Three women and two children were among the dead, and
three people were wounded."


Witnesses said six gunmen in two vehicles swooped down on the
minibus and riddled it with bullets, the officer added.


While it was not known whether the victims were Sunni or Shiite,
the entire agricultural region just south of the capital has been
a focus for sectarian violence.


In a similiar incident, gunmen in the nearby town of Latifiyah
set up a fake checkpoint, stopped a minibus and shot its eight
passengers, killing five.


Another four people were killed when a salvo of mortar rounds
rained down on the town.


A roadside bomb targeting a passing Iraqi army patrol went off in
the same area killing a civilian.


In northern Iraq, insurgents in the disputed oil city of Kirkuk
killed a blacksmith who refused to help them, police said.


"They forced him to sit inside his car and then set it on fire
after he refused to manufucture the implements they use in their
attacks," said Captain Abdullah Mohammed.


Insurgents also killed three other people elsewhere in the city,
one of them a policeman, he added.
