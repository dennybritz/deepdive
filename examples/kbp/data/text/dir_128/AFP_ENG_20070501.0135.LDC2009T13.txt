As many as six foreign oil workers were kidnapped Tuesday by
unidentified gunmen in an attack on an oil facility off the coast
of Nigeria's southern Bayelsa State, a government official said.


"There was an attack on a Chevron platform. We understand five or
six expatriate workers have been kidnapped," the secretary to the
Bayelsa state government, Godknows Igali, told AFP.


Oil industry sources said six foreigners, including four Italians
and one US national, had been seized from an oil vessel.


They said the attack happened around 4:00am (0300 GMT) and that
one Nigerian naval personnel was killed in the incident.


Two separate Chevron sources confirmed that the attack was
carried out on one of their facilities but said details remained
sketchy.


There was no immediate confirmation from the Nigerian Navy.


On Monday evening in neighbouring Rivers state, the mother of the
governor-elect was kidnapped by an unknown militant group, a
Rivers government spokesman said Tuesday.


"The mother of the new governor was abducted last night in her
Ubima village, near Port Harcourt," Emmanuel Okah told AFP.


The Niger Oil Delta, a swathe of creeks and swamps and the size
of Scotland, is home to Nigeria's multi-billion dollar oil and
gas industry.


The region has seen a resurgence in violent attacks on oil firms
and personnel over the past two years.


More than 100 foreign workers have been kidnapped, but were later
released, while scores of Nigerian security personnel have been
killed by militant groups or armed gangsters.


The groups claim to be fighting for a larger share of the
country's oil wealth for the local residents, but some also
demand ransoms from oil firms before hostages are released.


Nigeria is the world's sixth biggest exporter, accounting for a
daily output of some 2.6 milllion barrels.
