Turkish police and labour unions involved in May Day clashes
Tuesday that saw more than 100 arrested, struck a deal allowing a
small group of demonstrators to march on an off-limits square in
Istanbul, a union leader said.


"We will only be a few thousand marching up to Taksim Square, but
we are millions in our hearts," said Suleyman Celebi, president
of one of the demonstration's organizers, the left-wing DISK
Labour confederation.


The demonstrators wanted to commemorate the 30th anniversary of a
deadly rally on the square, when unidentified gunmen opened fire
on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators, sparking panic that left 34
dead.


Police had orginally banned any protest on the site.


Celebi and a few hundred union officials were allowed to march up
to the central square from the Inonu Stadium where police, firing
tear gas grenades and using water cannon had earlier arrested
scores of demonstrators.
