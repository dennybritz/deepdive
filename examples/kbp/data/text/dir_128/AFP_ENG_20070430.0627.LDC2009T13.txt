Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez announced Monday his country's
decision to pull out of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, accusing them of exploiting small countries.


"I want to formalize the exit (of Venezuela) from the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)," Chavez said in
broadcast on Venezolana state television, branding them
"mechanisms of north American imperialism."


The OPEC nation's leader Chavez, a leftist firebrand who has made
a habit of demonizing the United States administration, was given
sweeping powers in February to govern by decree for 18 months in
his country.


"We are going to withdraw ... and let them pay back what they
took from us," he said, claiming that the organizations were "in
crisis."


"We are going to withdraw before they go and rob us," he added,
issuing an order for his Finance Minister Rodrigo Cabezas to
begin proceedings to withdraw Venezuela from the organizations.


The United States has accused Chavez of being a destabilizing
force in Latin America. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
said Wednesday that Chavez was wrecking his country "economically
and politically."


The IMF recently reviewed a campaign launched last September to
increase the stature and voting rights of emerging-market and
poor countries.
