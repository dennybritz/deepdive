A lawmaker resigned from Turkey's ruling party Tuesday over its
nomination of a former Islamist as its presidential candidate,
which has sparked a political crisis, parliamentary sources said.


Ibrahim Hakki Askar's resignation leaves the Justice and
Development Party (AKP) with 351 members in the 550-seat
parliament.


The prospect of Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul becoming president
has fuelled concerns among secularists that Islam will creep into
all fields of life.


He narrowly missed becoming the next head of state in a first
round of voting in parliament on Friday.


Within hours of the vote, the army said it was ready to act to
protect the secular order. In response, the government called the
army to order and Gul said he would not withdraw from the race.


Turkey's top court is expected to rule Tuesday on an opposition
demand to annul Friday's vote ahead of a second round of voting
this week.
