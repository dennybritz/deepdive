A Pakistani and a Saudi national were beheaded by the sword in
the conservative Muslim kingdom on Tuesday after being found
guilty of drug trafficking and murder, the Saudi interior
ministry announced.


Bakht Iqbal Mussafer Khan of Pakistan smuggled heroin which he
had swallowed into the country, it said, quoted by the state news
agency SPA. His execution was carried out in Riyadh.


The other convict, Abdullah bin Saleh al-Harbi, was convicted of
murder for shooting dead a fellow Saudi and beheaded in the
Muslim holy city of Medina, the ministry said.


The latest beheadings bring to 48 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in Saudi Arabia,
which applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law. Rape,
murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can all
carry the death penalty.
