Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe flew in to the Qatari capital
on Tuesday, the final leg of his tour of Gulf states aimed at
establishing an energy and business partnership.


Abe was set to hold separate talks with Qatar's emir, Sheikh
Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and his Qatari counterpart Sheikh
Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani.


Energy security and business tie-ups, including investment
coordination, are expected to figure high on the agenda of the
talks between Japan and Qatar, said a Japanese source requesting
anonymity.


Qatar is Japan's fourth largest natural resource exporter.


Oil shipments from the energy-rich state to the world's second
largest economy account for nine percent of the total, with 12
percent of Japan's natural gas imports coming from the country.


Abe's tour has already taken him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Kuwait. He was to fly to Cairo to meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on his way back to Tokyo.
