Scores of rare animals have disappeared or died at a zoo in
Cambodia's tourist hub Siem Reap, forcing authorities to close
the facility and highlighting the growing problem of private
animal farms.


The unreported deaths of two rare leopards at the Angkor Zoo were
among the reported 50 cases that caught the attention of
authorities, said Forestry Administration official Vann Sophanna.


Other animals, including birds and deer, have also vanished, he
told AFP.


"Valuable and rare animals always went missing and the zoo's
owner claimed they had died, but he did not report this," Vann
Sophanna said, adding that those animals left in the zoo were in
cramped, dirty cages and malnourished.


"The zoo lacks hygiene, there was not enough food for the animals
and there were no veterinarians," he said.


Officials say the remaining animals will be taken to a wildlife
rescue center for treatment.


Zoo owner Seng Chhoeun could not be reached for comment.


The illegal wildlife trade flourishes in Cambodia, fueled by
corrupt authorities and weak legislation.


Most of the trafficked animals feed the regional demand for
exotic pets or traditional medicines, although a growing number
are ending up in small private zoos throughout Cambodia.
