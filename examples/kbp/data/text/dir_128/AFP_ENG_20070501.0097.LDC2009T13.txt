Sri Lanka's World Cup cricketers are stranded in London after
their scheduled flight for home was cancelled following Tamil
Tiger rebel air raids in Colombo, officials said on Tuesday.


The players were booked on Emirates Airlines for the return
journey from London via Dubai, but the airline has since pulled
out of Sri Lanka.


Sri Lanka Cricket, which had organised elaborate plans to welcome
the cricketers who reached the final in the Caribbean, said it
was uncertain when the team would return home.


"There are 22 in the national contingent and we are trying to
find seats to get them all home this week," Sri Lanka Cricket
spokesman Samantha Algama told AFP.


Emirates and Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific indefinitely
suspended their flights to Sri Lanka following Sunday's air raids
by Tamil Tigers near the capital's international airport.


The guerrillas used two light aircraft to bomb two fuel depots
near Colombo.


Singapore Airlines said it would only fly in to the Bandaranaike
International Airport -- which shares a runway with the Sri
Lankan air force -- during daylight hours.


Sri Lanka lost to Australia in Saturday's final in Barbados.
