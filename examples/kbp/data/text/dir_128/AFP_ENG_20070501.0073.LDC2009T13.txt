Iran's top security official Ali Larijani visited the Shiite holy
city of Najaf on Tuesday to meet Iraq's most senior religious
authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, a provincial official
said.


Larijani was to meet the Iranian-born cleric and later hold a
press conference, Najaf government spokesman Ahmed Duaibil said.


The visit comes two days after Iran's announcement that it would
take part in conferences to be held in Egypt later this week to
discuss ways of bringing stability to Iraq.


Iran maintains close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led government,
despite US suspicions that Tehran's agents are deliberately
fueling Iraq's insurgency and sectarian war and assisting in
attacks that target American troops.


Larijani is on the second leg of a three-day visit to Iraq, and
has already met Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
