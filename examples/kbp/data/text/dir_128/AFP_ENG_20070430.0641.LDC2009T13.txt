Japanese prosecutors have appealed a verdict clearing a Tokyo
businessman of the abduction and killing of British bar hostess
Lucie Blackman, a court spokeswoman said Tuesday.


The Tokyo District Prosecutors Office filed the appeal on Friday,
the spokeswoman at the Tokyo District Court said.


The court last week sentenced Joji Obara, a wealthy former
property developer, to life in prison for raping nine women
including Australian bar hostess Carita Ridgway, who also died.


But the court said there was insufficient evidence to prove he
killed Blackman.


Obara, who denied all the charges, has already appealed the jail
term.


Blackman vanished while she was working in bars in Tokyo's seedy
Roppongi district to save money for a holiday in Australia. Her
dismembered body was found seven months later in a seaside cave
on the city's outskirts.


The case triggered a storm of media coverage in Britain and even
a personal appeal by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
