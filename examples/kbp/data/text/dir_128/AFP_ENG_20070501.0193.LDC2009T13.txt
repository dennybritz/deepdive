Six leading opposition figures jailed in Syria warned on Tuesday
that the "repressive climate" in their country was worsening and
called for the release of all political prisoners.


"Our situation as prisoners of conscience is part ... of the
crisis of public freedoms and human rights in Syria, which
started with the state of emergency imposed 44 years ago," they
said in a joint letter from Adra prison near Damascus.


"The crisis has reached its climax today, with increased
repression and suppression of freedoms," they wrote in the letter
published in Lebanon's leading An-Nahar newspaper.


The signatories are Anwar Bunni, Michel Kilo, Kamal Labwani,
Mahmud Issa, Faeq al-Mir and Aref Dalila. The newspaper did not
disclose how the letter was smuggled out of the Syrian prison.


The six opposition figures called for "solidarity" with rights
activists jailed in Syria, which has been under a state of
emergency ever since the Baath party seized power in 1963.


"The detainees should feel that they are not alone... and that
there is hope for a peaceful resolution of the crisis of freedoms
and human rights in Syria," they said.


"The Syrian people are paying a heavy price in order to obtain
their rights, and we hope that we are the last payment of this
expensive price in order for the Syrians to regain their
freedoms," they said.
