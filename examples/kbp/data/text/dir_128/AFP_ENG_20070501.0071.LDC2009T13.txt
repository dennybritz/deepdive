Riot police fired into the air in the southern Chinese territory
of Macau as a May Day street protest turned violent Tuesday and
officers scuffled with demonstrators in rare scenes of civil
unrest.


Officers opened fire with what were thought to be starter pistols
after the crowd of more than 1,000, protesting against labour
shortages and conditions, broke through police cordons lining the
march route.
