China expressed "indignation and opposition" Tuesday to the
resumption of diplomatic relations between arch-rival Taiwan and
the Caribbean state of St Lucia.


Foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao accused Taiwan of
pursuing "money diplomacy" in its efforts to seek diplomatic
allies around the world.


"The resumption of diplomatic relations between St Lucia and
Taiwan is a flagrant violation of the declaration on the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and St
Lucia," he said.


"It also constitutes interference in the internal affairs of
China," he said in a statement posted on the foreign ministry
website.


He urged St Lucia to rethink the decision or "be responsible for
the consequences incurred."


Taiwan's Foreign Minister James Huang, currently in St Lucia,
signed the communique of establishment of ties with his
counterpart Rufus Bousquet on April 30, the island's deputy
foreign minister Yang Tzu-pao earlier Tuesday.


Taiwan and St Lucia opened diplomatic relations in 1984 when
current Prime Minister John Compton was first in power.


Taipei severed ties in 1997 when prime minister Kenny Anthony
switched recognition to Beijing. Compton was re-elected late last
year.


Including St Lucia, 25 countries now recognise Taipei.


Latin America, the South Pacific and Africa are the main
diplomatic battlegrounds for rivals Taiwan and China, which split
in 1949 at the end of a civil war.
