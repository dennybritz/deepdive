Police have raided 30 addresses across Britain and Europe as part
of a "substantial" operation aimed at tackling animal rights
extremism, British police said Tuesday.


Hampshire Police in southern England said about 300 officers were
involved but declined to give details about which countries were
involved or whether any arrests had been made, a force
spokeswoman told AFP.


"Police officers are executing warrants to enter and search
premises at 30 addresses throughout the UK and Europe," the force
said in a statement.


"The warrants have been obtained as part of an ongoing
investigation into criminal activity associated with animal
rights extremism.


"This is a substantial police operation led by forces from the
South East region and supported by a number of other UK and EU
police forces and European law enforcement agencies."


Other British police forces involved included Sussex, Kent,
Surrey and Thames Valley, all in southern England.
