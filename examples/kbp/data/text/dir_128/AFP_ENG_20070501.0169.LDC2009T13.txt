Police fired in the air and fought pitched battles Tuesday with
demonstrators near a central Istanbul square during tense May Day
rallies, reports said.


Police fired warning shots when they came under attack from a
stone-throwing crowd trying to force its way into Taksim Square,
declared off-limits to a left- wing May Day rally, the Anatolia
news agency reported.


The agency said the incident occurred in front of the Army
Officers' Club in the upmarket Harbiye district, between the
Hilton and Divan hotels, just north of Taksim.


On the other side of the square, in the popular Okmeydani
district, some 1,500 riot police and about as many demonstrators
armed with sticks, stones and slingshots, fought a pitched battle
for more than one hour.
