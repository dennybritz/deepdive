Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko has been ruled out of Tuesday's
Champions League semi-final second leg at Liverpool.


The Ukraine international has not travelled with the squad and
joins Ricardo Carvalho and Michael Ballack on the sidelines.


Arjen Robben has been included in the squad after making a
quicker-than-expected recovery from knee ligament damage.


Midfielder Michael Essien is available after a one-match European
ban, Carvalho is ruled out with a knee problem, which could see
Essien partnering John Terry at centre-back, while Ballack has
had an ankle operation which will rule him out for at least 10
days.


Didier Drogba is one yellow card away from missing a potential
final in Athens if Chelsea can hold onto their first-leg lead,
while it is expected that Khalid Boulahrouz could come into
defence.


Liverpool expect to have full-back Steve Finnan back following a
neck injury for the clash.


Finnan has missed the last four matches, although on Saturday at
Portsmouth he was officially rested as boss Rafael Benitez made
seven changes from the side which lost at Stamford Bridge in the
first leg.


Those seven - Jose Reina, Daniel Agger, Jamie Carragher, Steven
Gerrard, Javier Mascherano, Dirk Kuyt and John Arne Riise - all
look certain to start, while Benitez will also consider using
Peter Crouch in the starting XI.
