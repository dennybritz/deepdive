Taliban militants Tuesday beheaded an 18-year-old policeman in
southern Afghanistan's Kandahar province, a governor said.


Abdul Rahim was returning to duty from holidays when he was
captured by the insurgents at Mushan village in Panjwayi
district, local governor Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi said.


"Terrorists beheaded Abdul Rahim, and his headless body was left
in a school in the village," Sarhadi told AFP.


Sarhadi blamed the attack on "enemies of Afghanistan," a term
often used by authorities to refer to Taliban militants.


Yousuf Ahmadi, a purported Taliban spokesman, claimed
responsibility for the killing in a telephone call from an
unknown location.


"Abdul Rahim was executed in Mushan village today after he
confessed he was spying for the government," said Ahmadi.


The Taliban, whose regime was ousted from power by a US-led
military offensive in late 2001, have launched a bloody campaign
against the US-backed government of President Hamid Karzai.


Iraqi-style decapitations are now being copied by Taliban
insurgents.
