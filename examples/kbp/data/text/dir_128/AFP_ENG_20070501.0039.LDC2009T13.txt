At least one person was killed when a five-storey apartment
building collapsed in northeast Spain after a strong explosion
early Tuesday, a media report said.


Rescue teams were struggling against flames and fumes to find
victims trapped under the rubble, Radio Nationale reported.


The building in central Palencia was completely destroyed in the
blast around 6:00 am (0400 GMT).


One person was killed and 16 were wounded but officials feared
the toll could be much higher.


The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear.
