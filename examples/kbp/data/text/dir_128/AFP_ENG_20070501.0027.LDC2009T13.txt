An unidentified gang opened fire on a bus heading south from
Baghdad on Tuesday, killing 11 Iraqis including women and
children, police Lieutenant Haider Allawi said.


"The bus was carrying people to Hilla from Baghdad and was
attacked as it passed Iskandariyah. Three women and two children
were among the dead, and three people were wounded," he said.
