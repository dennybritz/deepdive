Japanese share prices closed down 0.72 percent on Tuesday, hit by
overnight losses on Wall Street and a dearth of buyers in a
holiday week, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
lost 125.43 points to 17,274.98.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares declined 7.75
points or 0.46 percent to 1,693.25.


Dealers said activity was muted with many bourses elsewhere in
the region closed for the Labour Day holiday while Japan's
markets are only open for two days this week.
