The husband of Philippine President Gloria Arroyo was released
from hospital Tuesday, more than three weeks after he underwent
heart surgery.


Jose Miguel Arroyo, 60, was told to "slow down" and change his
high-profile lifestyle, his doctor Juliet Cervantes told
reporters.


She said he would have to learn how to "manage his stress."


"Any sudden burst of emotion can increase blood pressure but
hopefully he would be able to adjust to his new lifestyle," she
said.


The portly Arroyo was also told to regulate his diet and avoid
high-cholesterol and fatty foods.


Cervantes said Arroyo would be in "cardiac rehab" until he fully
recovers in the next few months.


She said there appeared to be no complications from the operation
to correct an aortic aneurism.
