The leader of Nepal's Maoists on Tuesday threatened to launch
massive nationwide protests by the end of the month unless
parliament immediately ousts the king and declares a republic.


"We will organise a third movement in the country from late May
if the interim parliament delays the declaration of a republic,"
Prachanda told a crowd at a May Day celebration in Kathmandu.


Since being forced to end direct rule and reinstate parliament
after mass protests last April, King Gyanendra has been stripped
of most of his powers, including his position as head of state.


Under the terms of a peace deal signed between the Maoists and
mainstream political parties last year, the long-term status of
the monarchy is supposed to be decided by elections for a body
that will rewrite the constitution.


The polls had been scheduled for June, but now look likely to be
delayed.
