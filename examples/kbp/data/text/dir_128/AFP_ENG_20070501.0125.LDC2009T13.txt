It's not everyone's idea of a holiday, but some South Korean
clinics are cashing in as Japanese use their Golden Week break
for cosmetic surgery overseas.


The long holiday gives patients a chance to let facial swellings
shrink before they have to return to work, and prices in Seoul
are said to be half those charged for similar treatments in
Japan.


Ana Clinic in southern Seoul told AFP it had appointments with
about 40 Japanese during the Golden Week, compared to the weekly
average of 20 from that country.


Theme Dermatologist clinic has some 30 Japanese patients this
week, five to six times higher than average, according to Segye
Ilbo newspaper.


Double-eyelid surgery and nose jobs are among the most popular
treatments for foreign clients, and face-lifts and skin-whitening
are also in demand.


The Korea Tourism Organisation said it expected more than 76,000
Japanese to visit Korea this week.
