Turkish shares and the currency extended their losses on Tuesday
amid a political crisis over presidential elections that has set
the Islamist-rooted government against the army.


The national index of the Istanbul stock exchange lost 1,119
points, or 2.49 percent, in morning trading to close at 43,865.4
points.


The index had shed 4.0 percent on Monday.


The lira traded at about 1.377 against the dollar, losing about
0.7 percent of its value since Monday.


Tensions rose late Friday after parliament held a first,
inconclusive round of voting to elect the new president in which
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a former Islamist, was the sole
candidate.


Within hours of the vote, the army issued a stiff statement
threatening to take action to protect the secular order.


The government responded the next day day by sharply reminding
the army that it remains under the orders of the civilian
authority.


The Constitutional Court is expected to rule later Tuesday on an
opposition demand to cancel Friday's vote over a quorum rule, a
day before parliament is scheduled to hold a second round of
voting.


If it cancels the vote, early elections could be called within
three months.


If it rejects the opposition demand, then Gul is all but certain
to be elected the next head of state in a third round vote
scheduled for May 9.
