Iran on Tuesday said the idea of holding negotiations with the
United States was "not serious" in the current climate, amid
expectations of bilateral talks between the two foes at a
conference on Iraq this week.


"The question of negotiations with the United States is not
serious," government spokesman Gholam Hossein Elham said,
according to the Mehr news agency.


"So long as the United States does not renounce its attitude and
oppressive and satanic vision, the problems will not be solved,"
he added.


Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki will be attending the
international conference on Iraq's security in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh this week alongside US Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice.


Washington has not ruled out the idea of Rice meeting Mottaki for
talks on Iraq but Tehran has so far refused to say what its
position on the issue is.
