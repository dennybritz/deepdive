US coffee giant Starbucks aims to open the first of 100 planned
outlets in India by the end of 2007, a report said Tuesday.


"We are excited about the great opportunities that India
presents," a spokesman for Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. was
quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India.


"We target opening the doors of our first store by the end of
2007 in either New Delhi or Mumbai," the official said.


The company has submitted a fresh application to India's Foreign
Investment Promotion Board for the mandatory clearance, after an
earlier request to forge a joint partnership was reportedly
turned down.


India allows up to 51 percent foreign investment in single-brand
retail outlets. Others have to operate through a franchise system
with local owners.


"Starbucks submitted a revised application on April 13 to operate
single-brand retail stores in India with a restructured entity,"
the company official told Press Trust.


Local coffee chains have mushroomed in tea-drinking India in the
past few years as spending increases because of a booming
economy.
