Iran's top security official Ali Larijani  on Monday blamed the
persistent violence in Iraq on American "misbehaviour and
misconduct" after visiting Shiite Islam's top cleric.


Larijani met Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in the Shiite holy city
of Najaf during a three-day tour of his country's war-torn
neighbour.


The visit came two days after Iran's announcement that it would
take part in conferences to be held in Egypt later this week to
discuss ways of bringing stability to Iraq.


Iran maintains close ties with Iraq's Shiite-led government,
despite US suspicions that Tehran's agents are deliberately
fuelling Iraq's insurgency and sectarian war and assisting in
attacks that target American troops.


Larijani said there was no truth to such accusations and said
much of the violence in the country should be blamed on US
"misbehaviour and misconduct."


"The Americans know Iran has always supported the political
process in Iraq," he said at a press conference following the
meeting.


"They know where those terrorists are coming from, because they
usually come from countries friendly to the United States."


Larijani is on the second day of a three-day visit to Iraq, and
has already met Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
