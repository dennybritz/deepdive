Turkmenistan's new president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, has
been made a general in the isolated Central Asian state's army, a
state-owned newspaper announced Tuesday.


Parliament, which is closely controlled by the president in the
gas-rich ex- Soviet republic, conferred the rank on
Berdymukhammedov, the Neutralny Turkmenistan newspaper reported.


Berdymukhammedov's predecessor, the dictator Saparmurat Niyazov,
also took the rank of general. As Turkmen president he is
automatically commander-in-chief of the armed forces.


The official biography of the new president does not mention
whether he has any military experience.


Under Soviet rule a minimum two-year conscription was obligatory
for most men, although students were given deferments.


Berdymukhammedov trained as a dentist and was a health minister
in his predecessor's government.


He has taken limited steps to distance himself from Niyazov's
cult of personality.
