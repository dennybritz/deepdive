Thirty people were arrested Tuesday after raids across England,
Belgium and the Netherlands targeting suspected animal rights
extremists, police said.


Hampshire Police in southern England, which is co-ordinating the
operation, said about 300 police officers were involved.


"The people arrested are all suspected of being involved in
criminal activity associated with animal rights extremism," the
force said in a statement.


"All have been taken to undisclosed police stations across the
country and will be interviewed throughout the day.


"This is a substantial police operation led by forces from the
south east region and supported by a number of other UK (United
Kingdom) and EU (European Union) police forces and European law
enforcement agencies."
