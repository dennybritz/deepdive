At least three people were killed when a powerful explosion
ripped through a five-storey apartment building in northeast
Spain early Tuesday, officials said.


Rescue teams with sniffer dogs were struggling against smoke and
flames to find victims trapped under the rubble of the building
in central Palencia. Local media said cries for help could be
heard coming from the debris.


"There are three dead and seven hospitalised," a spokesman for
the local authorities told AFP.


Officials said about 20 people were believed to have been in the
building at the time of the blast, of whom only about 12 had been
accounted for.


The apartment block was completely destroyed in the explosion
around 6:00 am (0400 GMT).


"There are others trapped," Palencia Mayor Heliodoro Gallego told
reporters.


He said that at this stage a gas leak was the most likely cause
of the explosion.
