Two men were Tuesday arrested by Australian authorities on
terrorism charges in a series of raids in the southern city of
Melbourne, police said.


No details of the allegations against the two men, who were due
to appear in court later Tuesday, were immediately available.


"Victoria Police took part in a number of raids across Melbourne
in relation to anti-terrorism operations and the operation is
continuing," a police spokesperson told the Australian Associated
Press.


The arrests came a day after nine other men arrested in anti-
terrorism swoops in Sydney in 2005 were ordered to stand trial
for allegedly stockpiling bomb-making materials and plotting
attacks on the country's largest city.
