President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono pledged Tuesday three million
dollars in funding for Indonesia's restive Poso, where
intermittent sectarian violence has claimed hundreds of lives.


He said 27.5 billion rupiah (three million dollars) has been
earmarked for development of the divided district on Sulawesi
island, where Muslims and Christians live in roughly equal
numbers.


"Poso has to receive special attention from the central
government, so that the population of Poso, the victims of the
conflict, can have their wounds healed," the president said.


His remarks came during a two-day visit to the area, which
Tuesday included seeing the construction of an Islamic boarding
school in Poso town.


Poso district gained worldwide attention after Islamic militants
beheaded three Christian schoolgirls in 2005. Three Islamic
militants were jailed for up to 20 years for the killings.


Poso has seen sporadic unrest since violence between Muslims and
Christians claimed around 1,000 lives in 2000 and 2001. Tension
rose again in September last year after three Christians were
executed for inciting religious attacks.
