Four Vietnamese workers died in a coal shaft collapse, the second
such disaster at the mine this year, officials and state media
said Tuesday as the communist country marked the May 1 Labour
Day.


The men, aged 25 to 32, were killed Sunday at a mine operated by
a subsidiary of the state-run North-East Coal Corporation near
Cam Pha, 150 kilometres (90 miles) east of Hanoi, in the northern
Quang Ninh province.


"We have opened an investigation to determine the cause of the
accident, but we think security measures for the workers were
inadequate," said a North-East Coal Corporation official who
asked not to be named.
