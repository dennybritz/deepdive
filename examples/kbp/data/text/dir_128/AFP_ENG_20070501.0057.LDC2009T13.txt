Gunmen opened fire on a bus heading south from Baghdad to the
mainly Shiite provincial capital of Hilla on Tuesday, killing 11
Iraqi men, women and children, police said.


"The bus was carrying people to Hilla from Baghdad and was
attacked as it passed Iskandiriyah," police Lieutenant Haider al-
Lami said. "Three women and two children were among the dead, and
three people were wounded."


Police found the yellow minibus by the side of the road just
north of the town of Iskandiriyah, a flashpoint for insurgent
activity.


Witnesses said six gunmen in two vehicles swooped down on the
minibus and riddled it with bullets, the officer added.


While it was not known whether the victims were Sunni or Shiite,
the entire agricultural region just south of the capital has been
a focus for sectarian violence.


Another four people were killed when a salvo of mortar rounds
rained down on Latifiyah, a town 40 kilometres (25 miles) south
of the capital, not far from Iskandiriyah.


Another civilian was killed when a roadside bomb was triggered by
an Iraqi army patrol in the same area.
