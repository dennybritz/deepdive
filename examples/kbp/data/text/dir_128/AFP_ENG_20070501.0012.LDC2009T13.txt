Japan gave a cool response to a World Trade Organisation proposal
that no more than five percent of agriculture products be
designated as "sensitive" items in global free trade talks.


"We are dissatisfied with the new proposal. We cannot protect
sensitive products with a level of five percent," Agriculture
Minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka told reporters in Geneva late
Monday, according to officials in Tokyo.


Crawford Falconer, the chairman of the WTO's special committee on
agriculture, proposed Monday that the number of "sensitive"
products -- such as rice in Japan -- that would be excluded from
drastic tariff cuts should be limited to no more than five
percent of the total.


Japan wants a level of between 10 and 15 percent, while the
United States wants no more than one percent and the European
Union hopes for eight percent.


Falconer also called on the United States to cut trade distorting
domestic support to below 19 billion dollars per year in an
attempt to revitalise moribund world trade liberalisation talks.


Agriculture has been a key stumbling block in the WTO's Doha
round of trade negotiations, which were launched in the Qatari
capital in 2001.


The US and EU have engaged in bitter arguments over the subject,
with Brussels demanding more reductions in US farm subsidies and
Washington insisting that proposed European tariff cuts do not go
far enough.
