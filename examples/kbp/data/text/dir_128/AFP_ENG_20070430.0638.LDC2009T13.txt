Jeff Suppan pitched his 12th career complete game and first in
four years as Milwaukee took a 7-1 win over St. Louis, who were
playing with heavy hearts after the death of a teammate Sunday.


The Cards Sunday's game against the Chicago Cubs was postponed
because of the death of reliever Josh Hancock.


A key member of the Cardinals' pitching bullpen and part of their
World Series- winning team last season, Hancock was killed in an
early morning car accident Sunday. He was 29.


Prior to Monday's game, the Brewers held a moment of silence in
Hancock's honour.


"You can't put it into words," said Cincinnati Reds outfielder
Adam Dunn, who played with Hancock in 2004-05.


"Whether it's a guy you've never run across or a guy you used to
play with, regardless of who it is, it's sad."


The Cardinals' bats continued to struggle on Monday against the
Brewers.


Kevin Mench added two hits and two RBI for Milwaukee, which plays
four games with Pittsburgh and three with Washington after this
three-game set.


On April 14, Suppan (4-2) beat the club he helped to the World
Series title, allowing two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings,
and was better this time around.


The righthander yielded eight hits and a walk with six strikeouts
for his first complete game since July 28, 2003 to improve to 7-1
in 10 all-time starts at Miller Park.


The National League Championship Series MVP was allowed to become
a free agent by St. Louis and signed a lucrative deal with
Milwaukee.


St. Louis managed just two extra-base hits and has scored three
runs or fewer in 16 of its 24 games.


Skip Schumaker had two hits for the Cardinals, who have lost
three straight.
