The number of unemployed people in Germany, the eurozone's
biggest economy, dipped below the politically key mark of four
million in April, Labour Minister Franz Muentefering said
Tuesday.


The jobless count dropped to 3.967 million last month,
Muentefering said in a statement, and predicted that the number
would continue to fall this year.


"The growth forecasts and labour market development show a clear
trend: unemployment is sinking," he said.
