Thailand's deposed premier Thaksin Shinawatra was unveiled
Tuesday as the the new chief of the Professional Golf Association
of Thailand (PGA).


Thaksin, a billionaire politician ousted in a September military
coup, was named by PGA's board on Monday, said the group's
secretary general Wichar Siritham.


Thaksin was picked for the job despite living in exile since he
was toppled. He is currently in Beijing, where he opened a Jack
Nicklaus-designed golf course last week.


"It will not be any problem for him to take the post while he is
living abroad. I think having him as the new president will
benefit Thai golf because Thaksin has the (financial) capability
to promote professional golfers," Wichar said.


Wichar said Thaksin has already pledged two billion baht (57.5
million dollars) from his Thaicom Foudation to support the Thai
PGA.


The ousted premier reportedly has also made a surprise bid worth
108 million pounds (215 million dollar) to buy English Premier
League football club Manchester City.


He made his fortune in telecoms before becoming prime minister in
2000.
