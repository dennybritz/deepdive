Small bombs exploded at three railway stations in Bangladesh on
Tuesday, including one in the capital Dhaka, but there were no
reports of casualties, police said.


Railway officials said leaflets possibly linked to the bombings
were found at two stations. One of them called for a break in
relations with a minority group of Muslims frequently targeted by
Islamic extremists.


"The bombs went off at about 7:00 am (0100 GMT). They created
panic but no one was injured, a police official told AFP.
