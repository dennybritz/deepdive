Former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has emerged as
the frontrunner in an anticipated takeover bid after being given
access to Manchester City's accounts on Monday.


City have recently been targeted by former player Ray Ranson,
however the club were not happy with some of the terms of
Ranson's initial proposal before he submitted an updated version.


Thaksin, who failed to buy Liverpool three years ago, has been
linked with a 100 million pounds (200 million dollars) bid for
City.


His advisers will now carry out due diligence, which allows a
potential buyer to examine the accounts of the organisation in
question and decide whether it is a worthwhile investment for
them to make.
