Thousands of workers from Taiwan's leading telecom operator,
Chunghwa Telecom, rallied Tuesday to protest the company's early
retirement plans which they said threatened their rights.


Wearing headbands with the slogan "defending workers' rights" and
purple union vests, the protesters gathered outside the
transportation ministry -- Chunghwa's largest shareholder -- to
demand the removal of company chairman Hochen Tan.


"Hochen gives himself a big salary raise while unreasonably
trying to force some 5,000 workers to accept early retirement, so
we are asking the ministry to fire him," said Chuan Ping-tang,
secretary general of Chunghwa Telecom Workers' Union.


Some 3,500 workers joined the protest, according to Chuan.


Chunghwa Telecom president Lu Shyue-ching, meanwhile, justified
Hochen's 160,000 -Taiwan-dollar (4,850-US) monthly pay raise as
necessary to keep outstanding managers.


The union has fiercely opposed privatisation of the company,
saying it jeopardised employee benefits. It has also refused to
sign an agreement governing benefits and compensation after
privatisation.
