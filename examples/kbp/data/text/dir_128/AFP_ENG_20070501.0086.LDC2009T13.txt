Turkish police arrested scores of people including union leaders
taking part in May Day demonstrations here Tuesday, organizers
and the media said.


Most of the 82 arrests made by mid-morning came as participants
in one of two major rallies tried to march on central Taksim
Square in defiance of a ban by the Istanbul authorities,
according to the Anatolia news agency.


Land and sea traffic was paralyzed in the city of more than 12
million as the authorities blocked roads, cancelled ferries and
closed metro stations as they tried to cope with two labour
rallies on either side of the Bosphorus.


Unionists were trying to gather at Taksim to commemorate a deadly
rally there 30 years ago when unidentified gunmen opened fire on
a crowd of peaceful demonstrators, sparking panic that left 37
dead.
