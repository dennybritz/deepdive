Worcester on Tuesday confirmed former Wales coach Mike Ruddock as
their new director of rugby on a three-year contract.


Ruddock, who led Wales to a 2005 Six Nations Championship clean
sweep, has agreed a three-year contract and will take over from
John Brain.


Brain left the club on Monday just 48 hours after Worcester
secured their Premiership survival by finishing one point above
relegated Northampton.


Despite Wales securing their first Grand Slam for 27 years during
Ruddock's reign, he left the post suddenly midway through last
season's Six Nations campaign.


The reasons for his departure have never been fully explained,
although so- called player power was believed to be a factor.


Ruddock, who has been assisting his local club Mumbles in a
coaching capacity, will inherit a Worcester squad that has
already been strengthened for next season by the signing of All
Blacks centre Sam Tuitupou, while most of the existing playing
group have already agreed to stay at Sixways.
