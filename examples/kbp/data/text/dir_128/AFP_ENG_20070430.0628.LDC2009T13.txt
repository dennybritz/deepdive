Google on Tuesday will add a bit of style to home pages
customized by users of its globally popular Internet search
engine.


The Mountain View, California-based firm is adorning personalized
homepages with an "iGoogle" logo and rolling out "Gadget Maker"
tools for people to easily tailor pages with pictures, videos or
musings.


"Gadget Maker allows users to bring their favorite offline
information online and share with their friends and family, or
the whole world," Google said.


"Anyone who can upload a photo or write an e-mail can use one of
Gadget Maker's seven modules to create a personalized gadget
without knowing how to write code."


People can use the service to customize iGoogle homepages with
features such as pictures, online "blog" journal postings,
YouTube videos, and "Google Gram" animated greeting cards.


The iGoogle service is adding 15 new languages on Tuesday,
bringing the total to 26.


Increasing the ranks of people using iGoogle homepages enables
the Internet firm to make more money from online advertising and
refine its search formula by studying the terms people use to
seek information online.
