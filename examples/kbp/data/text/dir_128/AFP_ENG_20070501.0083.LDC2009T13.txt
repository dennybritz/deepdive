Unidentified gunmen shot dead three Tamil civilians in Sri
Lanka's embattled eastern province on Tuesday, military officials
said.


The victims were found in the village of Sittandy in Batticaloa
district, a military official in the area said.


The latest killings came a day after the defence ministry
reported the killing of 12 people in two separate incidents in
the island's northeast.


The violence followed an air attack by Tamil Tiger light aircraft
in the capital Colombo.


A fuel storage tank owned jointly by the government and the
Indian Oil Company was destroyed while two buildings of Shell Gas
Lanka, the local unit of the Anglo-Dutch giant, also suffered
fire damage on Sunday, officials said.


The Tigers carried out their first ever air strike last month and
followed it with a second last week on the Palaly military
complex in the north of the country.


Police and security forces sealed off Colombo last Saturday,
searching every vehicle entering and leaving the city amid fears
of a rebel attack.


The Tigers are believed to be operating five Czech-built Zlin-143
aircraft smuggled onto the island in pieces and re-assembled,
government officials say.


The rebels say they are fighting for an independent homeland for
Sri Lanka's minority Tamil community.


The conflict has killed more than 60,000 people over some three
decades.
