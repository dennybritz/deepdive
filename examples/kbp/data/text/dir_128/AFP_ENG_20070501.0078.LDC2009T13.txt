Tony Blair said Tuesday that he would make a statement next week
on when he will stand down as British prime minister.


"I will make my position clear next week," Blair said in an
interview on Britain's GMTV breakfast programme, 10 years to the
day since the general election that swept his governing Labour
Party to power.


Blair praised his likely successor, finance minister Gordon
Brown, saying he would make "a great prime minister".
