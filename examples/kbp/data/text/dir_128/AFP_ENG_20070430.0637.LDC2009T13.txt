Japanese police said Tuesday they had arrested a third man in
connection with last month's slaying of the mayor of Nagasaki.


Masaki Yamashita, 29, was arrested on suspicion of abetting the
gangster who shot mayor Iccho Ito as he campaigned for re-
election, a spokesman for the Nagasaki police department said.


Yamashita turned himself in Tuesday and confessed to having
helped the assassin, Tetsuya Shiroo, by watching the movements of
the 61-year-old mayor, who was shot twice in the back on April
17, he said.


On Sunday police also arrested Hiromi Ogawa, 60, on suspicion of
having driven Shiroo to the scene of the murder.


Shiroo, who has been linked to Japan's biggest underworld
syndicate, Yamaguchi- gumi, is thought to have had a personal
grudge against city authorities after his vehicle was damaged at
a construction site.


The mayor, a staunch anti-nuclear campaigner, had been seen as a
shoo-in for a fourth term before his slaying, which prompted the
government to consider tightening gun controls.
