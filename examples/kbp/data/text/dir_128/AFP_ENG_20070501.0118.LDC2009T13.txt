As many as six foreign oil workers were kidnapped Tuesday by
unidentified gunmen in an attack on an oil facility off the coast
of Nigeria's southern Bayelsa State, a government official said.


"There was an attack on a Chevron platform. We understand five or
six expatriate workers have been kidnapped," the secretary to the
Bayelsa state government, Godknows Igali, told AFP.


Oil industry sources said six foreigners, including four Italians
and one US national, had been seized from an oil vessel.
