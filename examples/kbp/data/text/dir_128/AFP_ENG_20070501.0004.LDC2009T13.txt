China has inaugurated what is believed to be the world's tallest
pagoda, which at almost 154 meters (510 feet) reaches even higher
than the Great Pyramid of Egypt, state media said Tuesday.


Buddhist monks from China and abroad have gathered for the
opening of the 13-storey Tianning Pagoda, a Zen place of worship,
in the eastern city of Changzhou city, the Xinhua news agency
reported.


The structure took five years and 300 million yuan (39 million
dollars) to build, it said.


Tianning Temple, one of the four largest Zen Buddhist temples,
dates from the Tang Dynasty (618 to 907 AD). It has been
destroyed and rebuilt five times over the past 1,350 years,
Xinhua said.


Religion is experiencing something of a renaissance in modern
China, as the government has lifted many of the social controls
in place in earlier decades.


A recent survey suggested China now has 300 million worshippers
of various religions, three times as many as previously thought.
