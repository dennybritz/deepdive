The number of unemployed people in Germany, the eurozone's
biggest economy, dipped below the politically key mark of four
million in April, Labour Minister Franz Muentefering said
Tuesday.


The jobless count dropped to 3.967 million last month,
Muentefering said in a statement, and predicted that the number
would continue to fall this year.


"The growth forecasts and labour market development show a clear
trend: unemployment is sinking," Muentefering said.


Around 5.05 million people were on the dole in April 2005, about
1.1 million more than now, he said.


He noted a strong, positive trend among the jobless under the age
of 25, with their numbers sliding to about 400,000 from 555,000
two years ago.


Muentefering, who is also vice-chancellor and a member of the
Social Democrats, one half of Germany's left-right coalition
government, said Germany was seeing the fruits of former
chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's labour market reforms, as well as
a robust economic recovery.


Muentefering released the figures on May Day, one day before the
Federal Labour Agency makes its official monthly report on
unemployment.


German joblessness in March stood at 4.108 million.
