Two suspected members of Sri Lanka's separatist Tamil Tiger rebel
group were Tuesday arrested in Australia and charged with
funnelling money to a terrorist organisation, police said.


The men, 32 and 36, were arrested in anti-terrorism raids in
Melbourne and were expected to appear in court later Tuesday
accused of supporting the guerrillas who are fighting Sri Lanka's
government.


"It will be alleged in court that these men are members of an
organisation engaging in terrorist activity overseas and they
have been providing active, material support to that group," said
Australian Federal Police Counter Terrorism Manager Frank
Prendergast.


But he stressed that the men's alleged support of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) posed no terror threat to Australia.


Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Kieran Walshe said police
would allege the men actively raised funds with the knowledge
some of the money would be diverted to fund Tiger operations in
Sri Lanka.


The men were charged with being members of a terrorist
organisation, providing support to a terrorist organisation and
intentionally receiving funds from or making funds available to a
terrorist organisation.


Each faces a maximum of 25 years in jail.


The Tamil Tigers have waged a 35-year battle for independence
that has claimed more than 60,000 lives in Sri Lanka.
