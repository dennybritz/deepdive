Israeli cabinet minister Eitan Cabel said on Tuesday that he had
tendered his resignation from the government after the
administration was lambasted for its handling of last year's war
in Lebanon.


"Following the publication of this report, I cannot remain in a
government led by Ehud Olmert," the minister without portfolio
told a news conference.


The prime minister "has lost the trust of the people and should
resign immediately," Cabel added.


Army radio speculated that his departure could have a "domino
effect" on other ministers, with opinion polls, commentators and
opposition politicians across the board demanding that Olmert and
Defence Minister Amir Peretz resign.


The government commission appointed by Olmert seven months ago
accused him of "serious failure in exercising judgement,
responsibility and prudence" during last year's war against
Hezbollah.


The report was equally withering about Peretz and then chief of
staff Dan Halutz concluding that they failed in fulfilling their
functions.
