US-led coalition warplanes killed four militants who had attacked
a government building in eastern Afghanistan, the coalition said
Tuesday.


The casualties occurred after nearly a dozen militants attacked
the administration office of eastern Khost province's Spera
district late Monday with rockets and gunfire, it said.


"In response to a request from the (police), coalition forces
responded with close air support, killing four insurgents," the
statement said. Seven other rebels were wounded.


Two Afghan policemen defending the facilities in the remote town
near the Pakistani border were also wounded, it said, adding that
gunfight lasted more than two hours.


Attacks on remote government buildings and police checkposts as
well as staff and troops are routine in Afghanistan, where the
remnants of the Taliban have waged an insurgency since their 2001
ouster.


The Taliban were toppled by a US-led invasion for failing to hand
over Al- Qaeda's chief Osama bin Laden.


More than 1,000 people, many of them militants, have died in the
violence this year.


About 50,000 foreign troops are in Afghanistan to help the
government gain control of areas overrun with Taliban militants,
drug barons and private armies.
