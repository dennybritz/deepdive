Thousands of Japanese joined May Day rallies in the capital
Tuesday urging the government to tackle wealth inequalities in
the world's second-largest economy.


"There must be no 'working poor'. We must solve the problems of
income disparity and poverty," Mitsuo Bannai, president of the
National Confederation of Trade Unions, told a rally at a Tokyo
park.


"We must ensure stable employment for the young, women and all
workers," he told an estimated crowd of 42,000 people, according
to organisers.


Another major union, Zenrokyo, also held a rally to protest
deteriorating employment conditions as companies try to cut costs
amid intense global competition.


Japan's largest labour federation, Rengo -- or the Japanese Trade
Union Confederation -- staged rallies at 28 locations across the
country on Saturday, instead of Tuesday.


Organisers said 42,000 people gathered at Rengo's central rally
in Tokyo, where its president Tsuyoshi Takagi called on the
government to help narrow the gap between rich and poor in the
country.


"Although the economic recovery is said to be continuing, small-
and medium- sized companies and rural areas are lagging behind in
their recovery," he told the weekend rally.
