Workers from the two Koreas called for the reunification of their
divided homeland Tuesday when they held the first joint May Day
celebration in South Korea.


Some 2,000 workers, including 60 northerners, waved "unification
flags" during the May Day rally at the southern industrial city
of Changwon.


It was the first time since the 1950-1953 Korean War that North
Korean workers had visited South Korea for the joint May 1
international labour festival.


The two Koreas, following an inter-Korean peace summit in 2000,
had joint May Day celebrations in 2001 and 2004 -- both in North
Korea.


The North Korean men in business suits and women in traditional
gowns mingled with their southern peers during the May Day
ceremony which featured a rally, music concert and soccer match.


"Many people say reunification is not easy, but each step taken
by labourers will lay a great foundation for the reunification,"
Lee Young-Duk, head of the South's Federation of Korean Trade
Unions, said.


"Let the workers from the North and the South bring together
their passion ... for a reunified fatherland," the North's
delegate Lee Chung-Bok said.


The North's team led by Won Hyong Guk, vice-chairman of the
Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of
Korea, flew into Changwon Sunday and returns home Wednesday.


The two Koreas have yet to sign a peace treaty since the
1950-1953 Korean War, but tensions have eased since a peace
summit between their leaders in 2000.
