French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen called on his
supporters Tuesday to abstain en masse from voting in Sunday's
presidential election.


Le Pen said neither socialist candidate Segolene Royal nor
rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy deserved the support of the 10.44
percent of voters who backed him in the first round of voting.


"I call on voters who have shown their confidence in me to cast
their vote neither for Madame Royal nor for Mr Sarkozy and to
abstain en masse," said Le Pen, who came fourth in round one.
