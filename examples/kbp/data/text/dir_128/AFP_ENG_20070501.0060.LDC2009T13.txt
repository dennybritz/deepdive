No one was more surprised than Japanese film star Maiko Kawakami
to hear that her fluffy poodle was really a lamb in disguise.


The actress on Tuesday denied foreign media reports that she had
been the victim of a scam by tricksters importing lambs from
Australia and Britain to sell as poodles to thousands of
unsuspecting rich Japanese women.


News of the reported hoax reached as far as Britain, the United
States and Australia before police and Kawakami quashed it as
untrue.


The British tabloid The Sun reported that the scam came to light
after Kawakami complained on a television talk show that her new
poodle refused to bark or eat dog food and that she was
devastated when told it was a lamb.


"Ms. Kawakami is very surprised by how much this has spread
overseas. She was just recounting on television how she had heard
of such a story while she was at a nail salon," a spokeswoman for
her talent agency said.


"Ms. Kawakami does not even own a poodle!" she added.


As a result of the international coverage, Kawakami -- who
starred in Takeshi Kitano's Japanese thriller "Violent Cop" --
appeared on television again Tuesday to deny the reports.


Police in Sapporo, where the fraudulent company was reportedly
based, also denied the sheepish tale.


"We have had inquiries from so many media -- CNN, CBS among
others -- and all I can say is that that article is completely
made up," a spokesman said.
