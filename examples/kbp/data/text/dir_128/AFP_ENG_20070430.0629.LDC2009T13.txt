Taiwan announced Tuesday that it had re-established relations
with the Caribbean state of St Lucia in a diplomatic victory over
rival China.


Taiwan's Foreign Minister James Huang, currently in St Lucia,
signed the communique with his counterpart Rufus Bousquet on
April 30, said deputy foreign minister Yang Tzu-pao.


Taiwan and St Lucia opened diplomatic relations in 1984 when
current Prime Minister John Compton was first in power.


Taipei severed ties in 1997 when prime minister Kenny Anthony
switched recognition to Beijing. Compton was re-elected late last
year.


Including St Lucia, 25 countries now recognise Taipei.


Latin America, the South Pacific and Africa are the main
diplomatic battlegrounds for rivals Taiwan and China, which split
in 1949 at the end of a civil war.
