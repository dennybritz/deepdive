Four people were killed and 40 others were hurt after a collision
between two passenger buses along a mountainous highway in the
northern Philippines, police said Tuesday.


One bus swerved to the left after a rear tyre burst, smashing
into another bus on a road in Cordon town in Isabela province on
Monday night, they said.


Many of the casualties were students and teachers returning from
a national sporting event in the south.
