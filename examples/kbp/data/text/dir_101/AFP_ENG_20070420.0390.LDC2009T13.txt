A statue of South Africa's Nelson Mandela is to be erected in one
of London's most famous squares after five years of wrangling
over where to put it, officials said Friday.


The statue will be placed on Parliament Square, alongside statues
of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Benjamin
Disraeli, and others including former South African prime
minister Jan Smuts.


The nine-foot (2.7-metre) statue itself, designed by sculptor Ian
Walters, who died last year, will face the Palace of Westminster.


Though a date for its unveiling has not yet been set, the
decision itself ends a row over various proposed sites, with
other options including Trafalgar Square's north terrace, or
outside the building housing the South African embassy, which
looks onto Trafalgar Square.


London Mayor Ken Livingstone, who has long backed the erection of
a Mandela statue in London, said the decision "underlines
Mandela's special relationship with Britain and London...and
reflects his significance as a world statesman."


Wendy Woods, widow of journalist and anti-apartheid campaigner
Donald Woods, described the decision as "tremendous" news in a
statement received Friday.


Simon Milton, leader of Westminster City Council, said: "From the
start it was my belief that Parliament Square was a more suitable
location for a commemorative statue than Trafalgar Square, and I
believe that the proposed location is a fitting tribute to a
truly inspirational figure".
