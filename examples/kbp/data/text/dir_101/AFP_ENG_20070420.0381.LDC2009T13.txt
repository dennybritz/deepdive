The European Union will send letters to groups and individuals on
its terror register to explain why they are listed, EU diplomats
said Friday.


The decision, to be adopted Monday by EU foreign ministers, was
made in the wake of a ruling last year by Europe's second-highest
court annulling a freeze on the assets of the main Iranian
opposition group in exile.


The Court of First Instance ruled that the EU had not respected
the right to a fair hearing of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran
(OMPI), when it ordered the asset freeze in May 2002.


One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the
EU's reasoning will be posted in its official journal for the
groups and individuals for whom it has no address.


Those listed have 30 days "to present their arguments" against
the decision.


The terror register lists more than 50 organisations and
individuals, including the armed Basque separatist group ETA, Sri
Lanka's Tamil Tigers and the Islamist group Hamas.


It is supposed to be revised every six months but this has not
happened because of uncertainty caused by the court ruling.


An asset freeze is imposed on those who figure on the list.


The EU has already written to OMPI, recalling "the organisation's
past, notably the attacks that it has been responsible for", the
diplomat said.
