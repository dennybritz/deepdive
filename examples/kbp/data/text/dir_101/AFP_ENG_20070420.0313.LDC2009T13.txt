Failure to find a major sponsor has led to the cancellation of
the 92nd edition of the Zurich championship one-day race, one of
cycling's Pro Tour events.


Zurich - one of the richest cities in the world - is unable to
host the race, one of the oldest on the international calendar,
on October 7 because a sponsor can't be found, according to Swiss
agency Sportinformation.


Last year's race, held over 233.7km, was won by Spaniard Samuel
Sanchez.


Swiss racers have dominated the Zurich one-dayer, with 40
victories in 91 editions.
