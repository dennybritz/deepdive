Police detained one more suspect over the murder of three people
at a Christian publishing house in eastern Turkey, bringing to 11
the total number of those in custody, a source close to the
investigation said on Friday.


The 19-year-old suspect was picked up in Istanbul, about 1,100
kilometers (680 miles) west of Malatya in eastern Turkey, where
the deadly attack on the Zirve publishing house took place
Wednesday.


The suspect would be sent to Malatya -- where he was born -- to
be questioned, the source said.


In a brutal massacre that shocked the country, assailants slit
the throats of a German and two Turks after interrogating them
for three hours, according to press reports.


Police detained five suspects at the crime scene, including a man
who jumped out of a window to escape capture. Five other suspects
were captured later in Malatya.
