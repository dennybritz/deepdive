Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and his arch-rival Prime
Minister Viktor Yanukovych failed to reach a compromise on their
political stand-off at new talks on Friday, Yushchenko said.


While some issues have been resolved, Yanukovych still opposes
Yushchenko's decision to dissolve parliament and hold new
elections, the president said.


"The prime minister's side is in agreement on all questions"
necessary for a compromise "with the exception of early
elections," Yushchenko told a news conference after the talks.


Yushchenko ordered parliament dissolved on April 2, complaining
that Yanukovych's pro-Russian coalition was violating the
constitution and trying to undermine his authority by poaching
deputies.


The constitutional court has been examining Yushchenko's decision
but has yet to produce a ruling.


Large crowds of supporters of the two rivals have held
demonstrations in Kiev nearly every day this month, and a fresh
demonstration was expected Friday.
