Pakistani police arrested a man after discovering the decomposed
bodies of his parents and five siblings following his arrest for
another murder, officials said Friday.


The man, Rana Adnan Mehmud, 22, confessed to killing and burying
the bodies at a house in the central city of Multan a year ago,
investigating officer Munir Ahmad Chishti told AFP.


"The police dug up the house after Mehmud confessed to killing
his parents, two brothers and three sisters during interrogation
for another murder," he said.


He said police arrested Mehmud after he robbed and shot dead a
widow on Thursday night.


Mehmud told investigators that he first killed his mother,
sisters and brothers because his father wanted them to get
involved in "perverted activities," and then killed his father,
Chishti said.


But police were also probing whether his real motive was to grab
his father's land, after recovering fake legal documents from
Mehmud including one from his father granting him sole rights to
the land.
