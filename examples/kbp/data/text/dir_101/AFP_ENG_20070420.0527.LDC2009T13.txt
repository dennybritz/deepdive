Taliban holding two French aid workers hostage in southern
Afghanistan have called for the withdrawal of French NATO troops
and the freeing of imprisoned militants in exchange for their
release, their website said Friday.


The website demanded the "French government withdraw its soldiers
from Afghanistan in one week" and called on the Kabul
administration "for a rapid response with regard to an exchange
of prisoners".


Paris said Friday night it was analysing the demands.


A French envoy is in Kabul as part of diplomatic efforts by Paris
to free the two aid workers from the Terre d'Enfance (A World For
Our Children) charity who were seized in the southwestern
province of Nimroz on April 3.


France has deployed around 1,000 troops in the Kabul region as
part of the NATO force as well as Rafale fighter planes.
