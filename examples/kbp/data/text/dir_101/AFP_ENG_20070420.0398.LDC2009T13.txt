Brazil and Milan striker Ronaldo and retired French World Cup
star Zinedine Zidane will star in an anti-poverty TV advert made
by award winning filmmaker Wim Wenders, a UN agency said Friday.


The video for the United Nations Development Programme will
encourage poeple to join a global campaign to cut poverty by
2015.


"I've filmed gangsters, guardian angels, old Cuban musicians,
children, the fifth Beatle, a filmmaker, a trapeze artist, a
cowboy, an ex angel and a Vietnam veteran," Wenders said in a
trailer.


"Basically I've filmed many people but for the first time I'm
filming footballers," added the director of "Buena Vista Social
club", "Wings of Desire" and "Paris, Texas."


One of Wenders's early German movies, "The Goalkeeper's Fear of
the Penalty" (Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter) in 1971,
portrayed a goalkeeper who strangles a cinema cashier after he
was sent off in a match.


It will be the third time Ronaldo and Zidane have appeared side
by side in a video since they became goodwill ambassadors for the
UNDP, which is spearheading the drive for better lives in
developing nations.


One person in six in the world lives under the poverty line. Some
50,000 people a day die as a result of poverty, according to the
UN.


Filming is due to begin at the end of April in Paris.
