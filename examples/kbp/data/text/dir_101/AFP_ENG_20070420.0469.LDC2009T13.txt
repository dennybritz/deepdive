The head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jean-
Claude Juncker, called on Friday for light to be shed on a pay
scandal engulfing World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz.


"All light and clarity must be shed," Juncker told journalists
after chairing a meeting of eurozone finance ministers and
central bankers in the German capital.


"Then I would like all (directors) to draw the necessary
consequences," added Juncker, who is also Luxembourg's prime and
finance minister.


Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos shared Juncker's concerns.


"I think it's crucial for the World Bank to have a credible and
sound reputation and I'm concerned about its reputation with
everything that we know about what seems to have happened around
Mr Wolfowitz."


Directors of the development lender promised urgent action on
Friday in a statement after late-night talks on the fate of
Wolfowitz, a former US deputy defense chief.


Wolfowitz has been embroiled in a growing storm since it emerged
last week that he personally ordered in 2005 a hefty pay package
and guaranteed promotions for his girlfriend and bank employee
Shaha Riza.


The United States is by far the bank's biggest shareholder and
has its own seat on the board, along with Japan, Germany, Britain
and France. The 19 other directors represent blocs of the rest of
the bank's 185 member states.
