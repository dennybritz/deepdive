New Zealand were 115-6 after 20 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against Australia at the Grenada National Stadium
here on Friday chasing 349 to win.


Peter Fulton was on 48 with Daniel Vettori on four.


Skipper Stephen Fleming was unlucky to be given out for 12 when
he was judged to have been caught by Ricky Ponting off Shaun Tait
although the ball seemed to come off his arm.


That made the total 21-1 in the fourth over.


Ross Taylor was the next man to go caught by Michael Hussey at
midwicket for just three off Glenn McGrath's first ball with the
total on 29.


The Black Caps then lost four wickets for the addition of just 34
runs with Scott Styris (27) getting caught by Matthew Hayden off
McGrath, Craig McMillan (1) lbw to Tait, James Franklin (6)
bowled by Shane Watson and Brendon McCullum (7) caught by Hussey
off Brad Hogg.


Earlier, Hayden scored his third century of this World Cup as
champions Australia piled up 348 for six in their 50 overs.


Fit-again all-rounder Shane Watson marked his return from three
games out with a calf injury by scoring a blistering 65 not out.


Hayden's 103 off 100 balls, with two sixes and 10 fours, saw the
tournament's leading run scorer equal the record for most
hundreds at a single World Cup held by Australia's Mark Waugh
(1996) and India's Sourav Ganguly (2003).


Both sides have already booked their places in the semi-finals
with Australia facing South Africa in St Lucia on Wednesday and
New Zealand taking on Sri Lanka in Jamaica on Tuesday.
