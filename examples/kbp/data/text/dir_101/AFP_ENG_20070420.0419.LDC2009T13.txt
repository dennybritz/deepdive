Romanian President Traian Basescu said on Friday that he would
not resign following his suspension from office by parliament,
despite an earlier pledge to do so.


Before Thursday's vote, Basescu said he would resign "within five
minutes" if parliament went ahead with a vote to suspend him for
constitutional violations.


Parliament voted to suspend him on Thursday and the decision was
formally approved by the constitutional court on Friday.
