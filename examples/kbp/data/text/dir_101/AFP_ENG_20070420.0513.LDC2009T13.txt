Mauritania's new president on Friday appointed one of his rivals
in the presidential elections, Zeine Ould Zeidane, as the new
prime minister, the official AMI news agency said.


Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, named Zeidane, a former central bank
chief who came third in the first round of the presidential vote
last month to head the Islamic republic's new government after
two decades of authoritarian rule.


At 41, Zeidane was the youngest of the presidential aspirants and
garnered 15 percent of the vote.


A non-entity in Mauritania's political landscape before the March
elections, Zeidane came into the limelight when he threw his
support behind Abdallahi in the poll run-off.


Abdallahi went on to win the second round gaining 53 percent of
the ballot against veteran opposition leader Ahmed Ould Daddah.


He was sworn in as president on Thursday in the final step of a
successful transfer of power from a military junta which staged a
bloodless coup 19 months ago and vowed to restore democracy to
the northwestern African country.


Zeidane is an economist who taught at the university of Nice in
France and then in Nouakchott before being appointed to lead the
central bank during the tenure of ousted dictator Maaouiya Ould
Taya.


He left the central bank at the end of last year after he
finished carrying out reforms recommended by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
