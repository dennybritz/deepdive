Arizona's state Capitol complex was evacuated early Friday after
a bomb threat, police and officials said.


The Arizona senate, house, and governor's tower in central
Phoenix were cleared after a bomb threat was phoned in at around
8:00 am (1400 GMT), according to state police officials.


Bomb-sniffing dogs are exploring all three buildings, according
to an aide to Governor Janet Napolitano. Police said the search
of the complex would take several hours.


The threat was received about an hour before a bell-ringing
ceremony to remember the victims of the Virginia Tech mass
slaying Monday was scheduled to get under way.


The ceremony was moved to a park across the street from the
Capitol complex and held on schedule.
