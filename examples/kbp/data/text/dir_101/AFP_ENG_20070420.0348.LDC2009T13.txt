Armed men attacked an oil rig security vessel at a facility of a
multinational oil company in Nigeria's southern oil-rich state of
Bayelsa, officials said Friday.


Unconfirmed industry sources said six people were thought to have
been wounded in the attack late Thursday while three could have
been kidnapped during the attack late Thursday.


But Navy spokesman Captain Obiora Medani told AFP that nobody was
either kidnapped or injured.


"There was neither hostage-taking nor injuries", Medani said.


"There was indeed an incident last night. We suspect it was a
piracy activity but the details are still sketchy, and we have
sent officials of the state ... for investigation," Bayelsa state
government secretary Godknows Igali said earlier in Yenagoa.


The attack targeted Mike One, a security vessel supporting
Trident 8, a transocean rig drilling for Conoil at Brass, in the
Gulf of Guinea.


Violence is rife in the states of the oil rich Niger Delta, with
frequent attacks on foreign oil companies and kidnapping of
expatriate employees by armed gangs or separatists seeking a
greater share for local deprived populations of the region's oil
wealth.
