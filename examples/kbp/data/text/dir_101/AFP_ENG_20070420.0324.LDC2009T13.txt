The parents of a Colombian governor who were kidnapped in
neighboring Venezuela on Monday have been freed, police said
Friday.


Authorities said the parents of La Guajira Governor Jose Luis
Gonzalez Crespo -- abducted from their farm in the town of El
Guarero, in the neighboring Venezuelan state of Zulia -- were
safe and sound.


"They are well, thank God, and at this time they are in
Maracaibo" Venezuela, Ana Gonzalez, a sister of the governor,
told RCN radio of her parents. She said they were released in
Venezuelan territory.


Colombia's Vice President Francisco Santos has blamed the
incident on the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), Latin America's oldest and largest insurgency.
