Basic prevention measures like seatbelts, helmets and speed
limits can cut the number of deaths in road accidents by up to
half, the Red Cross said Friday as it joined a global road safety
campaign.


The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies launched a guide for its national associations
worldwide outlining priorities to cut an estimated 1.2 million
deaths a year and 50 million injuries on the world's roads.


"We must act now and this guide can be a real road map to save
lives," said the guide's author, Gerard Lautredou.


"If we worked in Africa to make sure people wear seatbelts and
against speeding, we would halve the number of deaths in five
years," the Red Cross road safety expert told journalists.


Red Cross priorities include wearing seatbelts or helmets for
motorcyclists, as well as campaigns against speeding and drunk
driving.


Lautredou said death rates in road accidents had dropped by 20 to
40 percent in a few years in countries that had implemented at
least one of those measures.


He called for action "without waiting for heads of states to be
affected, like in Kenya where the president did a lot for road
safety after he was involved in an accident."


The campaign is aimed at influencing the general public through
the Red Cross's proximity as a health care provider in many
countries, as well as at convincing individual governments to
finance a coherent road safety policy in their countries.


The United Nations is holding its first "Global Road Safety Week"
from next Monday.
