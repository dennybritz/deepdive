Vatican theologians are set to declare that limbo does not exist,
opening the gates of heaven to babies who die unbaptised, a
member of the papal theological commission told AFP.


"The many factors that we have considered ... give serious
theological and liturgical grounds for hope that unbaptised
infants who die will be saved and enjoy the beatific vision,"
says a document published Friday by the US magazine Origins.


The mediaeval concept of limbo as a place where unbaptised
infants spend eternity but without communion with God seems to
reflect an "unduly restrictive view of salvation," the document
says.


The idea behind limbo was that unbaptised babies could not go to
heaven because their original sin had not been expunged, but nor
should they go to purgatory or hell.


In 1984, when Pope Benedict XVI headed the Vatican's doctrinal
enforcement body as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, he said he was
"personally" in favour of scrapping the 13th-century notion,
which he termed a mere "hypothesis."


He has approved the document drafted by the International
Theological Commission, the panel's secretary told reporters,
adding however that its conclusions were not to be considered
Roman Catholic Church dogma.


A member of the panel, Dijon (France) Archbishop Roland
Minnerath, said the 41-page document was completed several weeks
ago after deliberations that began in November 2005.
