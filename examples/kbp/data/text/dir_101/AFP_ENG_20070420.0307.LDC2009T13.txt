Around 500 Britons a day are leaving the country, with Australia,
Spain and France the most popular destinations, although far more
new immigrants are arriving, official figures showed Friday.


The most recent statistics show that 380,000 people emigrated
from Britain for a year or more, of whom over half were British
citizens.


In the same period, 565,000 migrants arrived to live in Britain
for at least a year, boosting the country's overall population by
185,000, the highest figure since 1991, National Statistics said.


Of those arriving, 80,000 came from eastern European countries
which joined the European Union in May 2004, with 70 percent of
these Polish citizens, according to the 2005 figures.


In 2004-05, 71,000 Britons emigrated to Australia compared to
58,000 to Spain and 42,00 to France.


At the same time, 99,000 came to this country from India, 76,000
from Poland and 59,000 from China.


Nearly half of those coming to Britain gave work-related reasons,
while almost a quarter of immigrants came to study in Britain.
