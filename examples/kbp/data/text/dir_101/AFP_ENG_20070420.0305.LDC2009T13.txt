Highly-endangered mountain gorillas in the Eastern Africa region
have shown a steady resurgence in the past decade due to
conservation efforts, a wildlife group said Friday.


The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said currently there are 340
gorillas in Uganda's Bwindi Impenentrable National Park, home to
nearly half of the world's remaining mountain gorillas.


Although the figure represents a 12 percent growth in the past
decade the WWF said "it is indicative of a healthy and well
protected population."


Marc Languy of WWF's Eastern Africa regional programme said:
"This is indeed great news for the survival of the mountain
gorilla.


"However, with only about 720 individual mountain gorillas
surviving in the wild, more efforts are still needed to ensure
these beautiful animals do not become extinct."


Habitat encroachment and hunting in the eastern and northern
Bwindi Impenetrable National park as well as civil wars in the
region have been threatening the survival of the gorillas, the
group said.


The primates are also found in the mountain ranges spanning
Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and are
a source of high revenue from tourism.


However, early this year, rebels in the eastern DRC killed two
solitary silverback gorillas, sparking fears among
conservationists that the incidents could be a disaster for the
species.
