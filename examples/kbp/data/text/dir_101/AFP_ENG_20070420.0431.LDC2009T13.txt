Football's world and European governing bodies warned Macedonia
on Friday that it could be thrown out of international
competition if the president of the Macedonian football
federation is replaced.


FIFA and UEFA said in a joint statement that "a small number of
football delegates" held a meeting on April 14 to discuss the
replacement of Macedonian footballing chief Hari Hadzi-Risteski
at an "elective conference" next month.


The two governing bodies warned that the "any decision or actions
taken by such an illegal body against the duly elected
leadership... would not be recognised either on a national or an
international level."


"Such illegal actions are serious violations of FIFA and UEFA
statutes and may therefore lead to the suspension of the Football
Federation of (Macedonia) and a consequent ban on participation
in any international competition," they added.


The governing bodies had called on the Macedonian government to
stop interfering in the country's football association, after its
offices were closed and some of officials detained for
questioning in January. The warning was repeated last month.


FIFA and UEFA on Friday called on the Macedonian football family
to "unify and solve its problems through internal dialogue rather
than through illegal actions."


Macedonia currently lies fifth in qualifying group E for Euro
2008 with seven points, six points adrift from group leaders
Croatia and four points behind closest rivals England.
