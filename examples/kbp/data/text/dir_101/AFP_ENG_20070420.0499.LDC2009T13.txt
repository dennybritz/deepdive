Right-wing Nicolas Sarkozy is the "red-hot favourite" to win
France's presidential elections, over Socialist Segolene Royal
and centrist Francois Bayrou, British bookmaker Ladbrokes said
Friday.


The odds of Sarkozy winning the second and final round of
elections are listed at one to three, according to Ladbrokes.
Royal's chances are at 11 to four, while Bayrou's are at seven to
one.


National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen is the outsider, with
odds of 33 to one.


"For every pound being placed on the other candidates, 10 pounds
is being placed on Sarkozy at the moment," Ladbrokes spokesman
Robin Hutchison said.


"It looks almost too close to call -- but he justifies being the
red hot favourite on the weight of money alone," he said.


"We have seen some late interest for Jean-Marie Le Pen which is
interesting given the uncertainty but Bayrou seems to have
already run his race. We can't give him away at the moment," he
added.
