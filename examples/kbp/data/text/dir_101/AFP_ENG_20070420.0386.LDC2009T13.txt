A Pentagon inquiry in 2005 found that former deputy defense
secretary Paul Wolfowitz did not misuse his office in
recommending his girlfriend for a sole- source 2003 contract to
advise on Iraq, a spokesman said Friday.


Wolfowitz, who is fighting to keep his job as president of the
World Bank, acknowledged to the Pentagon inspector general that
Shaha Riza, a World Bank employee, was "a personal friend," said
Bryan Whitman.


"But the recommendation by itself, by the determination of the
IG, was not a misuse of his office," he said.


Wolfowitz is embroiled in controversy at the World Bank for
arranging lucrative pay raises and promotions for Riza after
taking over as the bank president.


It has emerged that while Wolfowitz was still at the Pentagon,
Riza visited Baghdad as a consultant for US military contractor
Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) in 2003, just
after the US-led invasion of Iraq.
