Workmen in London have painted over a 300,000 pound (411,000
euro, 600,000 dollar) piece by world-renowned graffiti artist
Banksy, reports said on Friday.


Although Banksy's canvases are snapped up by celebrities such as
Angelina Jolie for thousands of pounds (euros, dollars), his
stencilled graffiti creations can be found on walls and
billboards around the British capital.


Now one of these, a picture of John Travolta and Samuel L
Jackson's characters from the 1994 film "Pulp Fiction" holding
bananas instead of guns, has been painted over by a graffiti
removal team, the Daily Telegraph said.


In protest at the move, a fellow artist has painted a huge "come
back" message where the Banksy work used to be, near Old Street
in London's east end.


"Our graffiti removal teams are staffed by professional cleaners,
not professional art critics," said a spokesman for Transport for
London, employers of the workers who coated the piece in thick
black paint.


But George Thomas, who owns a barber shop below where the Banksy
used to be, said it used to attract dozens of tourists taking
photographs.


"There is no way it could have been mistaken for graffiti," he
told the Telegraph. "Whoever destroyed it is an idiot."
