Arizona's state Capitol complex reopened on Friday after being
evacuated following a bomb scare, police and officials said.


The Arizona senate, house, and governor's tower in central
Phoenix were evacuated after a bomb threat was phoned in around
8:00 am (1400 GMT), according to state police officials.


Teams of police officers with explosives-sniffing dogs combed the
building for four hours before giving the all clear for staff and
officials to return to their duties at around 11:15 am, police
said.


The threat was received about an hour before a bell-ringing
ceremony to remember the victims of the Virginia Tech University
mass slaying Monday was scheduled to get underway.


The ceremony was moved to a park across the street from the
Capitol complex and held on schedule.
