Portuguese authorities detained 31 people and seized dozens of
weapons in a raid on extreme right groups, police announced
Friday.


The Wednesday raids resulted in 15 firearms, more than a thousand
rounds of ammunition and a number of daggers and batons, police
said in a statement.


The operation targeted extreme right groups believed to be linked
to the notorious Hammerskin skinkhead organisation. Police said
those targeted were responsible for "inciting discrimination and
racial violence ..."


The far-right PNR party cancelled a gathering planned for
Saturday following the operation, and the party's president
denounced what he called "political persecution" against his
movement.
