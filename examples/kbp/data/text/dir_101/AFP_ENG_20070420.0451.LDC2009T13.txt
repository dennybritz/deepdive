US President George W. Bush said Friday it was too soon to judge
a US-led security push in Iraq, but stressed already "the
direction of the fight is beginning to shift."


"There are still horrific attacks in Iraq, such as the bombings
in Baghdad on Wednesday, but the direction of the fight is
beginning to shift," Bush said in a speech two days after those
attacks killed more than 200 people.
