The European Union should not impose its climate change solutions
on Asia and should remain open to alternative Asian ideas,
Denmark's environment minister said days ahead of a Europe-Asia
meeting.


"It is essential for the European side to engage in a real
dialogue and not to say 'this is how we did it and this is how we
think you should do it'," Environment Minister Connie Hedegaard
told AFP.


She said it was "important in this kind of meeting to remain very
open to them, to see how Asia sees the world and hear what they
want to tell us, to hear about their problems and their ideas to
resolve them."


The third meeting of Asian and European Union environment
ministers will take place on April 24-26 in Copenhagen, gathering
36 ministers and representatives to talk about global warming,
renewable energies, biodiversity and deforestation.


"Global deforestation represents 20 percent of all greenhouse
gases," the minister said.


The European Union has agreed to reduce emissions of carbon
dioxide by 20 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, and to
raise the amount of renewable energy used in energy consumption
to 20 percent by 2020.


Many Asian countries are reluctant to agree to similar
restrictions for fear it would hamper their economic development.
