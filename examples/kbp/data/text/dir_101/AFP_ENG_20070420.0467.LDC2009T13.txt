US President George W. Bush on Friday ordered a review of the
issues raised after a US campus rampage left 32 dead, and called
for recommendations to avoid future tragedies.


Top officials from the departments of education, justice and
health will travel the nation and "report back to me with
recommendations about how we can help to avoid such tragedies,"
Bush says in remarks released Friday.
