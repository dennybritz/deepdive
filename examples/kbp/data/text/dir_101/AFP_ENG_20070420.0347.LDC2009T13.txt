Pope Benedict XVI on Friday urged Sri Lanka's President Mahinda
Rajapakse to respect human rights when dealing with the country's
bloody conflict, according to a statement from the Holy See.


During a 20-minute meeting, the pope "repeated the necessity of
respecting human rights and reopening the path of dialogue and
negotiation, which is the only way to end the bloody violence
staining the island", it said.


Fighting between the army and separatist Tamil rebels has
intensified since Rajapakse's election at the end of 2005,
leaving more than 4,000 people dead.


The pope also underlined the Catholic church's commitment to the
"delicate work of forming consciences" in Sri Lanka "with the
sole aim of supporting the common good, reconciliation and
peace", the statement said.


Presidential spokesman Lucien Rajakarunanayake told journalists
that Rajapakse had highlighted the authorities' efforts to halt
the fighting.


Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote to Benedict XVI before Friday's
talks asking him to stress to the president the importance of
ending the violence.


The US-based campaign group also expressed concern for the fate
of Jim Brown, a Catholic priest who went missing last August
after being arrested at a navy checkpoint on the island of Kayts
in northern Sri Lanka.


The north and northeast of the country are strongholds of the
mainly-Hindu Tamil rebels, who are fighting for independence.
