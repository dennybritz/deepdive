A French envoy has told Afghan President Hamid Karzai that France
was "very firm" in its resolve to win the release of two French
aid workers kidnapped by the Taliban more than two weeks ago, the
foreign ministry said Friday.


Foreign ministry secretary general Philippe Faure held a meeting
with Karzai in Kabul during which he "recalled our position and
our very firm resolve to win the release of our two compatriots
and their three Afghan accompaniers," said foreign ministry
spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei.


President Jacques Chirac on Thursday spoke by phone with Karzai
about efforts underway to free the two aid workers from the Terre
d'Enfance (A World For Our Children) charity who were seized in
the southwestern province of Nimroz on April 3.


A videotape showing the French citizens was shown on Canadian
television at the weekend. Paris says it has not received any
demands from the kidnappers.


Karzai has said that the government will not make any more
hostage deals with the Taliban following the controversial
release of five rebels in exchange for kidnapped Italian
journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo last month.


There are more than 2,000 French troops serving in Afghanistan
and French Rafale fighterjets have been bombing Taliban positions
since the beginning of April.


The Islamist militia was ousted from power in a US-led invasion
in 2001.
