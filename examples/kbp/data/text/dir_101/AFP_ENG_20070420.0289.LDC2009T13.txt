McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food group, said Friday its
latest quarterly profits were heated up by a weaker dollar and
improved burger sales across America and Europe.


The Illinois-based McDonald's said its first quarter net profits
swelled almost 22 percent from a year ago to 762.4 million
dollars while revenues grew 11 percent to 5.46 billion dollars.


The weak US dollar, which has slumped heavily in value on foreign
exchange markets, helped McDonald's book better global revenues
as overseas customers paid for their meals with higher-value
currencies.


McDonald's also reported earnings per share of 62 cents which met
the forecasts of most Wall Street analysts.


"This quarter's results reflect higher revenues, increased
customer visits and enhanced profitability as we keep our brand
relevant through contemporary food and beverage offerings, modern
restaurants and attractive everyday value," McDonald's chief
executive Jim Skinner said.


The company, renowned for its Golden Arches logo, said its US
outlets in March had celebrated a 48th straight month of positive
comparative sales marking "a milestone not achieved since 1980."


The burger behemoth announced it had also struck an agreement
covering Latin America and the Caribbean with a group led by
businessman Woods Staton that will result in the franchising of
almost 1,600 McDonald's restaurants.


McDonald's said it expects to bank nearly 700 million dollars in
proceeds from the sale of the operations under the deal which is
tied to a 20-year license agreeement.
