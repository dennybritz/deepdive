Global mobile phone shipments slowed during the first three
months of the year, but market leader Nokia still shipped over 90
million handsets, an industry survey showed Friday.


The survey by research firm IDC said overall global shipments
grew 10 percent during the quarter compared with last year, as
market growth cooled.


Finnish phone-maker Nokia shipped double the number of handsets
of its closest rival, US phone maker Motorola, which is
struggling to maintain momentum and ring up fresh sales amid a
fierce price war.


Nokia shipped 91.1 million units compared to Motorola which
shipped 45.4 million handsets during the first quarter, according
to IDC.


Nokia's year-over-year shipments grew just over 21 percent, but
Motorola's shipments dropped 1.5 percent, the survey found. The
US firm was the only one of the top five to see a decline in
sales.


Samsung, the third largest maker, shipped 34.8 million handsets
followed by Japanese-Swedish group Sony Ericsson, which shipped
21.8 million units, and Korea's LG Electronics, which moved 15.8
million phones.


IDC said the slower sales pace was not surprising because so many
people already own mobile phones. IDC said fresh demand is
expected to come from owners looking to upgrade their phones,
rather than from people buying a first phone.
