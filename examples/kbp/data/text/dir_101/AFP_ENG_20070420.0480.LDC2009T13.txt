Brad Pitt will reunite with "Ocean's 13" co-star George Clooney
in the latest film from Joel and Ethan Coen, it was reported
Friday.


Pitt has signed to star in black comedy "Burn After Reading,"
which tells the story of a CIA agent who loses the disc of a book
he is writing, according to entertainment journal the Hollywood
Reporter.


It was not clear what role Pitt would play in the film, the
report said. Frances McDormand, who won a best actress Oscar in
1996 for her performance in the Coen brothers' "Fargo," will also
star in the film.


Filming will get underway in August.


Pitt most recently starred in the multilingual drama "Babel" and
will appear in "Ocean's 13," which will be screened at next
month's Cannes Film Festival.
