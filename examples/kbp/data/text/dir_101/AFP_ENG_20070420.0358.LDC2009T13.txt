The US embassy in Germany said Friday it was increasing security
at its facilities in the country due to a "heightened threat
situation," although officials in Washington played down the
danger.


"US diplomatic and consular facilities in Germany are increasing
their security posture," the statement said.


"We are taking these steps in response to a heightened threat
situation.  The US embassy encourages Americans in Germany to
increase their vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster
their own personal security."


A spokesman for the embassy said the increased threat came
against the backdrop of warnings from the German federal police
last month that Germany faced a higher risk of terrorist attack
following ultimatums from Islamic extremists for it to withdraw
its troops from Afghanistan.


The State Department in Washington stressed that the embassy
alert was not sparked by any "specific or credible" information
about threats directed against US interests in Germany.


Spokesman Tom Casey said the alert was based on "generic,
unspecific information" that has been reflected in worldwide
travel cautions issued regularly by the State Department given
the rising threat of terrorism in recent years.


"There's certainly nothing specific or credible out there"
related to the latest alert in Germany, he said.


Casey also played down a link between the embassy alert and
alleged threats by Islamic militants operating in Germany.


"I'm not aware of anything specific along those lines that
prompted this," he said.


"Everybody needs to take a deep breath on this," he said.
