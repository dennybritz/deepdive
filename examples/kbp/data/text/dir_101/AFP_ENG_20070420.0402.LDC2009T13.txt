Australia's Matthew Hayden equalled the record for most
individual centuries scored at a single World Cup with his third
hundred of the 2007 tournament, against New Zealand, in a Super
Eights match at Grenada's National Stadium here Friday.


He also scored 101 against South Africa and 158, an Australian
World Cup record, against the West Indies.
