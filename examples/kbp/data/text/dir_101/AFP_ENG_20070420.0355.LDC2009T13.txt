Georgia's Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli was recovering Friday
after a successful heart operation in the US city of Houston, a
government spokesman said on Georgian television.


"The doctors consider the operation a success. The prime minister
should return to Georgia in about two weeks," spokesman Gia
Zurabishvili said.


It was the second heart operation for Nogaideli, who was named to
the post after former prime minister Zurab Zhvania died in 2005
from accidental carbon monoxide inhalation.
