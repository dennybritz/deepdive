At least 113 civilians were killed and 229 wounded in three days
of fighting between Ethiopian troops and Islamist insurgents in
the Somali capital, a local human rights group said Friday.


Sudan Ali Ahmed, chairman of the Elman Peace and Human Rights
Organisation, told AFP his group arrived at the toll by collating
figures from hospitals, other humanitarian groups and counting
bodies abandoned in the streets.


"We call upon the Ethiopians and the insurgents to stop fighting
without any conditions. Otherwise, if they continue fighting many
people will die and that is pointless," Ahmed said.


The worsening situation in Mogadishu has led UN humanitarian
officials to warn of a looming disaster


The UN refugee agency said more than 321,000 people have fled
Mogadishu since February 1 when the fighting first began.


The UN said Somali government forces were blocking relief
supplies and that  UN aircraft were being shot at.


In Mogadishu, bodies were left lying in the streets, while a
cholera or diarrhoea epidemic was taking hold and new flooding
was likely soon, it added.
