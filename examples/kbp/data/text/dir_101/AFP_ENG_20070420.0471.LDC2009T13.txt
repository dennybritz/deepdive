A US-based non-governmental organisation supporting media freedom
in Russia suspended work Friday after a sweeping raid by economic
police, news agency RIA Novosti reported.


Educated Media, the local branch of US media training NGO
Internews, "is temporarily stopping its activities," RIA Novosti
quoted the organisation as saying in a statement.


Economic police raided the NGO's Moscow office on Wednesday,
seizing thousands of documents and computer servers in a search
that lasted until midnight.


"There is no way to conduct the seminars we have announced," the
statement said.


Internews, which is funded both by the US government and private
groups such as George Soros' Open Society Institute, provided
support for independent media that helped stir pro-democracy
uprisings in Georgia in 2004 and Ukraine in 2005.


The Kremlin viewed both as a blow to Russian influence in the
region, and has started projects including pro-Kremlin youth
groups that are dedicated to preventing any such uprising in
Russia.


The raid came in connection with a criminal case against
Internews director Manana Aslamazian, who was detained on January
21 attempting to pass through customs at Moscow's Sheremetyevo
airport with 9,550 euros (12,400 dollars) in undeclared currency.


The limit for undeclared currency is 10,000 dollars.
