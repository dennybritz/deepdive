The Swiss food giant Nestle is mailing two million bars of
chocolates to Swiss households to try to sweeten sales of one of
its brands after the wrapper was changed.


The move followed a 24 percent drop in sales for the group's best
selling Cailler brand in Switzerland last year, when it adopted
new high tech plastic packaging designed by French architect Jean
Nouvel.


The rebranding plans for Cailler, which was founded in 1825, also
includes new flavours developed by Spanish chef Ferran Adria, a
guru of innovative "molecular" gastronomy.


Philippe Oertle, a spokesman for Nestle Switzerland, said the
free distribution of the 100 gramme bars marked the
"reconciliation of the brand with the population."


Consumers more used to the old, dowdy paper and foil wrapping
were not the only ones upset by the new contemporary graphics.


There was also an uproar about the new plastic packaging's
environmental impact after it turned out to be more cumbersome
for recycling.


Cailler has since shifted back to traditional paper and toned
down the contemporary graphics, while Nestle is anxious to revive
sales of its traditional pillar on the demanding Swiss chocolate
market.


"People are thanking us, saying they've found their chocolate
again," said Oertle.


The marketing operation is costing the food giant about three
million Swiss francs, the Swiss newspaper Le Matin reported.
