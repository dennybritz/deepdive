Shares in French banking group Societe Generale shot up to a
record high point on Friday on rumours that Italian bank
UniCredit was planning a takeover bid.


Societe Generale later in the day denied a report in a German
newspaper that talks with UniCredit were under way.


But in early-afternoon trade the shares had climbed 11.02 percent
percent to 160.84 euros, after earlier hitting a peak of 162
euros.


Societe Generale closed on a gain of 7.74 percent at 156.09
euros.


Dealers said the share had soared on reports carried in German
daily Handelsblatt that Societe Generale and UniCredit were in
takeover talks.


The newspaper, quoting financial sources, said the heads of the
two companies, Daniel Bouton of Societe Generale and Alessandro
Profumo of Unicredit, had not as yet arrived at a concrete plan.
