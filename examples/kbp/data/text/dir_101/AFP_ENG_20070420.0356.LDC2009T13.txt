Archaeologists in northeastern Greece have unearthed eight tombs
containing the remains of men and women who lived over 2,000
years ago, along with an assortment of jewellery, weapons and
agricultural tools, the Greek culture ministry said on Friday.


The tombs dating from the fifth to third centuries BC were dug
into rock, were likely covered with stone slabs and probably lay
alongside an ancient road, the ministry said in a statement.


They were discovered near a highway between the cities of
Salonika and Edessa during road construction.


Prior excavation in the same area has already unearthed three
farms dating from Roman to Hellenistic times, and a fourth from
the Early Christian era.


The seat of the Macedonian Empire that stretched from the Balkans
to Egypt and India at its peak in the fourth century BC under
Alexander the Great, northern Greece is extremely rich in
antiquities.


But many such sites are often found to have been looted, with the
contents frequently ending up on the antiquity smuggling trade.
