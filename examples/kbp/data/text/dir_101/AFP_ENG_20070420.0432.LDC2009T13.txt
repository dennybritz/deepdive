Ecuador's socialist government on Friday announced it would
invest 2.84 billion dollars in poverty-reduction programs and
create 300,000 jobs in the next three years.


President Rafael Correa, an economist by training, said the
programs aimed to help the 38 percent of Ecuadorans who live in
poverty. The programs include allotments for school lunches and
microcredits.


Separately, it was announced that education spending would be set
at a quota of at least 6.0 percent of GDP, with increases being
phased in through 2012.
