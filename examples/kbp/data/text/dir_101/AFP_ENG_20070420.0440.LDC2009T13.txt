Senior US and Indian officials will meet here next week amid US
"frustration" at the pace of negotiations on finalizing a
landmark deal to give India access to US civilian nuclear
technology, a senior US official said Friday.


Indian Foreign Secretary Shiv Shanker Menon will be in Washington
Monday and Tuesday and will hold talks with Under Secretary of
State Nicholas Burns on the state of the negotiations, State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
