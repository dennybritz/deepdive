The Dutch ministry of Agriculture announced on Friday that it has
discovered mad cow disease in a seven-year-old cow.


It is the 83rd case of mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) in the Netherlands since 1997 but the first
since March 2006.


Netherlands authorities do routine checks on all slaughtered
bovines for BSE.


One cow from the same farm and another six from other farms
believed to be at risk for mad cow disease, because they received
the same feed or were descendants of the sick cow, were also
culled.


The Netherlands has so far recorded two cases of the human form
of the disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, since it first
appeared in 1996.
