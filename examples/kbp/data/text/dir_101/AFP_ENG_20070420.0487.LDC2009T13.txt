At least 113 civilians were killed and 229 wounded in three days
of fighting between Ethiopian troops and Islamist insurgents in
the Somali capital, a local human rights group said Friday.


Sudan Ali Ahmed, chairman of the Elman Peace and Human Rights
Organisation, told AFP his group arrived at the toll by collating
figures from hospitals, other humanitarian groups and counting
bodies abandoned in the streets.
