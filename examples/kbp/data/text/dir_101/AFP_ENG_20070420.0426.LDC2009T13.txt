IBF middleweight champion Arthur Abraham will make his long-
awaited return to the ring against Canadian Sebastien Demers in
Bamberg, Germany on May 26, his promoter announced Friday.


The unbeaten 27-year-old has been out of the ring since last
September as he recovered from the broken jaw he suffered in a
points victory over tough Colombian Edison Miranda.


Demers is also unbeaten and brings his 20-0 (with nine knock-
outs) record to take on the Armenian-born, German champion, 22-0
(17 KOs).


Demers is ranked 15th by the IBF and 14th by the WBA and should
not cause too many problems to Abraham, although the German is
not taking his opponent lightly.


"As a world champion I am used to fighting strong opponents. He
is taller than me and throws a good right hand. I have to be in
top shape to beat him," said Abraham.


"I have been waiting for a long time to make my fourth title
defense. I have been in training ever since January. Despite the
two titanium plates in my jaw I can't wait to get back into
action."
