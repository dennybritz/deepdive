Police investigating the "cash for honours" row which has tainted
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's final year in office handed a
file on the case to prosecutors Friday, they said.


The inquiry was launched last year amid claims that British
political parties including Blair's Labour had illegally offered
seats in the unelected upper House of Lords to financial
supporters.


London's Metropolitan Police said it had handed the 216-page
dossier -- the main file in the probe -- to the Crown Prosecution
Service (CPS), which will decide whether anyone should face
criminal proceedings in the case.


In a statement, the force said that 136 people had been
questioned either as witnesses or suspects.


Prime Minister Tony Blair and his entire cabinet are among those
who were interviewed as witnesses.


"We have had extensive consultation with the CPS during the
inquiry and provided them with reports together with over 6,300
documents," the Met said.


"It is now a matter for the CPS to consider the evidence, advise
us on whether any further enquiries are necessary and whether any
charges should be brought."


Four people have been arrested during the probe, including two of
Blair's closest aides, Lord Michael Levy, Labour's chief
fundraiser and Middle East envoy, and Ruth Turner, Downing Street
head of government relations.


While three people remain on police bail, no one has been
charged.


Blair is expected to announce his resignation next month after 10
years in office.
