Russia plans to export a record 7.5 billion dollars (5.5 billion
euros) of arms in 2007, up 15 percent from last year, a
presidential aide said Friday.


"Our projections for 2007 are 7.5 billion dollars (5.5 billion
euros)," Alexander Burutin said during a meeting with Russian
Orthodox priests who serve the country's armed forces.


Russia exported 6.5 billion dollars' worth of arms in 2006, with
the largest deliveries going to China and India.


Other major buyers included Algeria, Jordan and Syria, while
Russia hopes to increase sales to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya,
Yemen, Morocco, Kuwait, Qatar and Venezuela, Burutin said.
