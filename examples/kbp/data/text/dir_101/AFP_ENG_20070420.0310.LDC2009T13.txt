US shares opened higher Friday, with the leading Dow index riding
a record high, as confidence got a fresh boost from a flurry of
upbeat profit reports from corporate America, traders said.


A strong profit report from Internet search giant Google late
Thursday and solid earnings from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and
McDonald's on Friday helped boost investor sentiments.


The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average index was up a hefty
86.31 points (0.67 percent) at 12,894.94 in opening deals after
striking an all-time closing high of 12,808.63 points on
Thursday.


The tech-rich Nasdaq composite had gained 22.83 points (0.91
percent) to 2,528.18 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's was
9.02 points (0.61) percent higher at 1,479.75.


Stocks surged on the earnings reports and higher global markets
with no US economic reports in play Friday.


Google said, after the market close Thursday, that its profits
surged 69 percent to one billion dollars in the first three
months of the year while Pfizer booked quarterly profits of 3.99
billion dollars.


The world's largest fast food chain, McDonald's, meanwhile said
its latest earnings swelled almost 22 percent from a year ago to
762.4 million dollars.
