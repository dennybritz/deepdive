Shares in French banking group Societe Generale shot up to a
record high point on Friday on rumours than Italian bank
Unicredit is planning a takeover bid.


In early-afternoon trade the shares had climbed 11.02 percent
percent to 160.84 euros, after earlier hitting a peak of 162
euros, on an overall market which was 1.46 percent higher.


Dealers said the share had soared due to reports, carried in
German daily Handelsblatt, that Societe Generale and Unicredit
are in takeover talks.


The newspaper, quoting financial sources, said the chiefs of the
two companies, Daniel Bouton of Societe Generale and and
Alessandro Profumo of Unicredit, did not have a concrete plan as
yet.


Dealers quoted by Thomson Financial News' AFX wire however
pointed to market rumours that the two companies were discussing
a friendly takeover which would value Societe Generale at 175
euros a share.
