Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham has been called up for the
squad's crucial match at home against Valencia on Saturday after
being sidelined for six weeks due a knee injury.


The former England captain has not played since he suffered a
strain to the lateral ligament in his right knee in a game
against Getafe on March 4.


Beckham, who turns 32 next month, returned to group training with
his Real Madrid teammates on Wednesday for the first time since
he was injured.


The Spanish league title is Beckham's last chance to win a major
trophy with Real before he joins the Los Angeles Galaxy in
August, after going empty-handed since coming to the Spanish
capital in 2003 from Manchester United.


Nine-time European champions Real Madrid are in third place in
the standings, five adrift of leaders Barcelona and one ahead of
Valencia with just eight matches left.
