Nigerian authorities have delayed by two hours the start of
voting in the country's presidential elections on Saturday
because ballot papers printed in South Africa were late in
reaching the country, officials said.


Voting will start at 10 am (0900 GMT) and end at 5 pm, the
chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC),
Maurice Iwu, told journalists in Abuja.


"In consideration of the fact that we need to have a logistical
plan we can implement, the commission has revised the starting
time," Iwu said, adding that the 65 million ballot papers would
be distributed the moment they arrived.
