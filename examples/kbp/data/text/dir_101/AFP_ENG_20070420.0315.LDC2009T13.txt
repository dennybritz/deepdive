Croatian police said Friday they have detained an ethnic Serb
suspected of torturing Croatian prisoners during the 1991-1995
war.


The unnamed former paramilitary, 36, was detained on suspicion
that he "tortured, treated inhumanely and inflicted great
suffering" on prisoners in the wartime rebel Serb stronghold of
Knin, said a police statement.


The alleged crimes were committed in 1991 and 1992 in the 'Stara
Bolnica' prison where the suspect had served as a guard, it
added.


The man, who has Serbian residence, was arrested on Thursday in
the Knin region.


He had been identified by several people who were detained in the
prison while Knin and the surrounding region were occupied by
Serb rebels.


Croatia's proclamation of independence from the former Yugoslavia
in 1991 sparked the four-year war with Belgrade-backed Serb
rebels who occupied one- third of the country.
