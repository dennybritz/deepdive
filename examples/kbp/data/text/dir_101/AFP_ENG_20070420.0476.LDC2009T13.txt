Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba and his Malaysian Prime
Minister Dato' Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi agreed on Friday to
strengthen economic ties and increase trade at a meeting in
Windhoek.


"We intend to deepen our economic relations as trade between our
countries is growing steadily," said Pohamba.


"We wish to encourage more investments from Malaysia in research,
development and agriculture as well as mining, trade and
information technologies.


The Malaysian leader said Kuala Lumpur was interested in
construction and housing projects in the southern African
country.


"We want to achieve a win-win cooperation and forge strategic
alliances and facilitate new initiatives," he said.


Badawi is in Namibia on the last leg of a three-nation African
tour which has also taken him to Sudan and Kenya.


Malaysia's largest investment in Namibia is the 100-million-
dollar (73-million- euro) textile and garment factory Ramatex,
which initially employed 6,000 people.


However poor work conditions led to strikes and the company
reduced its staff by half.


Malaysia imports processed marble, precious stones for jewellery
production and textiles from Namibia.


During a bilateral business forum attended by Badawi on Friday
afternoon, Namibian Trade Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko said:
"Bilateral trade came to 30 million dollars last year. We hope to
increase that significantly this year."
