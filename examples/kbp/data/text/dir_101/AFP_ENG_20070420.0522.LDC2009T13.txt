A Nigerian vice presidential candidate escaped unharmed following
gunfire at his hotel on the eve of the poll Friday in southern
Nigeria, a diplomatic source said.


It was unclear whether Goodluck Jonathan, who is also governor of
southern Bayelsa state, was targeted by the gunfire. A high-
ranking governent official, speaking on anonymity, said Jonathan
had been taken to a safe location.


Jonathan is member of Nigeria's governing party.


Presidential elections are scheduled for Saturday, a week after
violence marred governorship and state assembly elections,
killing 21 people.
