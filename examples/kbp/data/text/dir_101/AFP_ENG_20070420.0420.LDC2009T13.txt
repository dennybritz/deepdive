A 42-year-old man in Norway was sentenced to five years in prison
on Friday for shaking his one-month-old baby girl to death, local
media reported.


The court in the southeastern town of Drammen found the man,
whose identity was not disclosed, guilty of "bodily harm with
death as result."


According to the prosecutor, the man shook his daughter and
knocked her against a hard surface in December 2003, causing
internal injuries that led to her death several days later.


The man denied the charges, insisting that the girl died after
her 15-month-old sister pushed her off the family's sofa.


He appealed the verdict.
