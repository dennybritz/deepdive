Nigerian authorities have delayed by two hours the start of
voting in the country's presidential elections on Saturday
because ballot papers printed in South Africa were late in
reaching the country, officials said.


Voting will start at 10 am (0900 GMT) and end at 5 pm, the
chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC),
Maurice Iwu, told journalists in Abuja.


"In consideration of the fact that we need to have a logistical
plan we can implement, the commission has revised the starting
time," Iwu said, adding that the 65 million ballot papers would
be distributed the moment they arrived.


He assured Nigerians that the presidential vote would be better
handled than last Saturday's elections for governors and state
assemblies to avoid malpractice and violence.


"We have learnt good lessons from Saturday's poll ... the
election of 2007 will be concluded peacefully, freely and fairly.
We are being transparent and open in what we have done so far,"
Iwu said.


At least 21 people were killed in election-linked violence last
weekend and President Olusegun Obasanjo acknowledged that voting
had been "marred" by fraud.


Iwu added that the name of Vice President Atiku Abubakar,
candidate of the opposition Action Congress (AC), would be on the
ballot paper following last Monday's Supreme Court ruling
annulling his disqualification by the INEC.
