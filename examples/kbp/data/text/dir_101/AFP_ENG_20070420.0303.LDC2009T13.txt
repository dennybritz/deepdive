France said on Friday the World Bank should be "beyond reproach"
in ethical terms, as the Bank's president Paul Wolfowitz came
under renewed pressure to resign over a croneyism scandal.


"What we have in mind is our concern that the World Bank carry
out its mission in good conditions and in particular in
conditions with are beyond reproach from an ethical point of
view," foreign ministry spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei told
reporters.


Wolfowitz is under pressure to resign over revelations that he
ordered a massive pay deal for his bank employee girlfriend,
Shaha Riza.


The French comments mean that Wolfowitz' support is limited to
the White House, which has said he should keep his job, as
several European countries have over the past few days warned of
the impact on the World Bank's reputation of the scandal.


"There is already coordination between European countries and we
hope that it continues," Mattei said.


France is one of the 24 members of the World Bank's board.
