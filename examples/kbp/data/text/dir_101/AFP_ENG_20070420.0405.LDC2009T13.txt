The European Union will step up efforts to rid Africa, the world
poorest continent and one of its most conflict-prone regions, of
landmines and small arms, officials said Friday.


"We are aware that the problems caused by landmines and the
illicit proliferation, circulation, accumulation and trafficking
of small arms and light weapons contitute a serious impediment to
social and economic development," said Tim Clarke, the EU
representative at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis
Ababa.


"These problems cannot be resolved unless there is tighter and
better coordinated international cooperation."


Speaking at the end of a three-day meeting in the Ethiopian
capital, Jeffrey Mugumya, director of the AU's peace and security
department, made an impassioned plea for help.


"Africa is the continent worst affected by the scourge of
landmines. We should move from policy formulations to active
implementation of these policies. We want to ensure ... that
within 10 years, Africa becomes a landmine-free continent.


"We are well aware that we cannot do this alone," he said.


The meeting also marked the 10th anniversary of the Ottawa
Convention, the most comprehensive international instrument for
ridding the world of antipersonnel mines.


The treaty deals with everything from mine use, production and
trade, to victim assistance, mine clearance and stockpile
destruction and has been ratified by 153 nations.


According to the United Nations Ethiopia, Eritrea, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Angola, Somalia and Sudan are Africa's worst
landmine-affected countries.
