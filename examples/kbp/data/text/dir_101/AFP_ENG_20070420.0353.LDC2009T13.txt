Heavily-armed men attacked a camp of uranium prospectors in
northern Niger early Friday, killing a security guard and
wounding three other people, industry sources said.


Some 20-30 men demanding a better deal for local Tuareg people
raided the camp operated by the French nuclear energy group Areva
housing around 250 people and made off with six vehicles and a
large number of mobile phones.


The raid took place around 3:30 am (0230 GMT) at Imouraren, 85
kilometres (55 miles) south of the main uranium-producing centre
of Arlit, the sources said.


A local security guard was killed and three others wounded one of
them "very seriously," an Areva spokesman in Paris said.


"It is the first time that something like this has happened in an
exploration camp," he said, adding that security there would be
tightened by the group in conjunction with Niger security forces.


The gunmen said they belonged to a group called the Niger
Movement for Justice, which emerged in February. They called for
the proper implementation of a 1995 accord which ended a Tuareg
rebellion by promising the tribesmen  priority in jobs with local
mining companies.


"For the past few weeks we have been noticing this group being
active in the region," the Areva spokesman said. "The Niger
government has tightened security -- we had asked them to -- on
all the sites owned by Areva."


One source said it was the first such raid for many years.


Niger ranks third among world uranium producers, with two large
mines in and around Arlit, both operated by Areva.
