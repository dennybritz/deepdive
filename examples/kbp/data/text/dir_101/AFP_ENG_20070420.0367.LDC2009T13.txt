World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz promised Friday to implement
recommendations of the lender's executive board investigating a
scandal involving a hefty pay increase given to his girlfriend.


In a brief statement issued after a late-night announcement by
directors, the embattled World Bank chief said he "welcomes the
decision of the Board to move forward and resolve this very
important issue."


Wolfowitz did not specifically indicate whether he would resign
over the affair, despite calls from key World Bank staffers and
harsh comments from some governments and activists.


But the statement said Wolfowitz "looks forward to implementing
the recommendations of the Board."
