Former Azeri health minister Ali Insanov was sentenced to 11
years in prison Friday for abuse of power and large-scale
embezzlement in a trial he denounced as politicised.


"Today's decision is a victory for rotten politics," Insanov told
journalists after the verdict was read.


The former minister, who maintained his innocence throughout the
trial, was arrested in October 2005 in what analysts described as
a purge of top officials ahead of parliamentary elections.


Authorities said 1.2 million dollars, 800,000 euros, hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of gold and diamonds, the deeds to
numerous properties and 17 valuable works of art were found
during searches of his home and office.


Prosecutors initially charged him with plotting to overthrow the
government as well, and requested the court sentence him to 12
years in prison.


During his trial, Insanov, who was health minister from 1993 to
2005, accused President Ilham Aliyev of usurping power by rigging
elections.


The influential former economic development minister, Farhad
Aliyev, was also arrested before the 2005 parliamentary elections
on charges of plotting a coup. His trial is due to begin later
this month.


The US, a close ally of oil-rich Azerbaijan, expressed concern
over the arrests, saying they raised questions about the
country's commitment to democracy.


The ruling Yeni Azerbaijan party won an overwhelming victory in
the 2005 parliamentary elections, which were marked by
allegations of voter fraud and intimidation.
