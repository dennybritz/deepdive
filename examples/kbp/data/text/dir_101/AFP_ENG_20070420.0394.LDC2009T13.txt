Spider-Man is set to spin his web on Broadway in a new musical,
with U2 stars Bono and The Edge providing the soundtrack, Marvel
Entertainment said in a statement.


The beloved comic-book hero, who will appear in cinemas next
month for the latest instalment of the massively successful movie
franchise, will be the first Marvel character to be immortalized
on stage.


The musical will be directed by Tony Award-winner Julie Taymor,
who famously adapted smash-hit Disney cartoon "The Lion King" to
the stage.


"Marvel continues to look to every entertainment medium to
support the enduring popularity of our Super Heroes, and we are
thrilled with the talent on board," said Marvel Studios chairman
David Maisel.


"The all-star creative team -- led by Julie Taymor, Bono and The
Edge -- is second to none, and we are certain this project will
delight fans of Spider-Man and new audiences alike."


First readings for the big-budget production will take place
later this year but a potential date for the premiere was not
revealed.


Although Spider-Man will be the first Marvel character to land on
Broadway, it is not the first time a superhero has attempted to
take to the stage.


In 1966, Superman was adapted for the stage but the production
"It's a bird... It's a plane... It's Superman!" flopped,
according to reports.
