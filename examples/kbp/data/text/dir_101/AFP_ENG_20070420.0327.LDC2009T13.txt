Poland's industrial production climbed 13.3 percent in March on a
12-month basis, continuing the strong growth shown the previous
two months, seasonally adjusted official figures showed Friday.


In February, seasonally adjusted figures put industrial growth at
13 percent, with the comparable figure for January being 15.5
percent.


On a monthly comparison, Polish industry grew by 1.7 in March
compared with February, the seasonally adjusted figures issued by
the national statistics board showed.


Unadjusted figures for March put 12-month growth at 11.3 percent
and monthly growth at 14.7 percent.


The surge in growth exceeded analysts' expectations, which had
predicted unadjusted figures would show month-on-month growth of
13.3 percent, with the 12-month figure at 10.5 percent.
