Police evacuated a building at NASA's Johnson Space Center Friday
after receiving a report that a gunshot was fired inside the
building.


A Houston police spokesman reached by AFP could not confirm if
there were any injured people inside the building.


"There was a report of a shot fired at building 44 ... inside the
building," said Victor Santinas. "I can't confirm anything beyond
that."


CNN broadcast images of a large group of people gathered outside
the buidling under police protection.
