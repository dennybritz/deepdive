The premiere of veteran director Franco Zeffirelli's staging of
Verdi's "La Traviata" in Rome on Friday will be shown live in 22
cinemas across Italy, the ANSA news agency reported.


The production is the eighth in 84-year-old Zeffirelli's career,
including one with Maria Callas, and will run until May 3.


Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu will sing the role of Violetta
on Friday and Tuesday.


But her husband, French tenor Roberto Alagna, is not in the
lineup.


Alagna created a scandal in December when he stormed off the
stage at Milan's La Scala opera house after being booed by a few
spectators during the opening aria of "Aida" -- under
Zeffirelli's direction.


He was replaced by understudy Walter Fraccaro for the rest of the
run.


A few days later, Ziffirelli suggested that a role in "La
Traviata" might help Alagna restore his reputation.


Leaving the stage in mid-performance "was madness, it's
indefensible," Zeffirelli said a few days after the incident. But
if Alagna "wants to recover his credibility in the world of
opera, he will have to make a lasting commitment. 'La Traviata'
may be a great occasion," the director said.
