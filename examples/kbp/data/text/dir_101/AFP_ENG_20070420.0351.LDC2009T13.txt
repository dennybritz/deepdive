Ten Bulgarians involved in trafficking women to France to work as
prostitutes have been arrested following a joint operation by
Bulgarian and French authorities, the national investigation
service said Friday.


"We received 13 European arrest warrants from the French
authorities but three of the wanted men are outside Bulgaria. The
other ten were arrested in the towns of Pazardzhik and Plovdiv,"
NIS press officer Darina Ivanova told AFP.


She added that five other men had already been arrested in France
for involvement in the same organised crime group engaged in
trafficking women to the city of Marseille.


Between 2002 and 2005, the group transferred at least 105
Bulgarian girls to France and forced them to work as prostitutes,
Ivanova said.


"The French authorities said this was the biggest ever human
trafficking case investigated in Marseille," she added.


A court of appeal has yet to issue extradition orders for the ten
arrested but, if convicted in France, they face jail terms of up
to ten years.


This is the second anti-trafficking operation to be held jointly
by Bulgarian and French authorities this year. In late March,
police busted another group of five Bulgarians involved in
trafficking women to work as prostitutes in the French city of
Lyon.
