Police investigating the "cash for honours" row which has tainted
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's final year in office have
handed a file to prosecutors on Friday.


The inquiry was launched last year amid claims that British
political parties including Blair's Labour had illegally offered
seats in the unelected upper House of Lords to financial
supporters.


Four people have been arrested during the corruption probe,
including two of Blair's closest aides. No one has been charged.
Blair and his entire cabinet have been interviewed.


Blair is expected by many political observers to announce his
resignation next month after 10 years in office.
