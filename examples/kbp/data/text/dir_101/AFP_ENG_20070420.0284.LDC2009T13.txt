New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond will miss Friday's World Cup
Super Eights match against champions Australia with a stomach
complaint.


Team spokesman John Durning told AFP at the Grenada National
Stadium, that Bond, who'd been vomitting Thursday night, was
being seen by doctors on Friday and was unlikely to come to the
ground.


Durning stressed that New Zealand's decision was not comparable
to Sri Lanka's controversial move in omitting key bowlers
Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan from the team that lost by
seven wickets to Australia here Monday.


"If there is one team Shane really likes playing against, it's
Australia," Durning said.


Fellow quick Mark Gillespie has taken Bond's place.


Both Australia and New Zealand have already qualified for the
semi-finals.
