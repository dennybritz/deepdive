Ivory Coast's former rebel chief and now Prime Minister Guillaume
Soro on Friday chaired his first cabinet meeting since he took
office this month under a fresh peace deal.


The new transitional government formed earlier this month, days
after Soro's appointment as prime minister following a peace deal
he clinched with his former arch-foe President Laurent Gbagbo,
met in the economic capital Abidjan.


Gbagbo who was in the political capital Yamoussoukro had
authorised Soro to lead the meeting, a government statement said.


"In the absence of the president of the republic, the cabinet
will be presided over by Soro," it said.


The two leaders last month penned an agreement in nearby Burkina
Faso aimed at leading to new elections to put to an end more than
four years of unrest.


Ivory Coast, France's former star colony in Africa and the
world's top cocoa producer, was a beacon of stability and
prosperity until it split in half in 2002 when Soro mounted a
failed coup against Gbagbo.


Until Monday, Soro's forces had controlled the landlocked north
of the country while Gbagbo's troops held the economically-
prosperous south adjoining the sea.


A buffer zone monitored by UN and French peackeepers was
dismantled on Monday as part of the new peace agreement.


In the transitional government, Gbagbo's party and allies hold 11
posts, including the interior and defence ministries.


Members of Soro's former rebel New Forces group hold eight posts,
including the justice, tourism and communication portfolios while
opposition parties hold 13 posts.


Friday's meeting took place at the presidential palace in
Abidjan.
