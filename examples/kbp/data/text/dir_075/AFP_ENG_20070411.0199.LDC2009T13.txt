A bomb blast on Wednesday targeted a police station in an eastern
suburb of Algiers, near the Algerian capital's international
airport, witnesses said.


Residents in Bab Ezzouar, a densely populated district which also
houses the university of science and technology, were unable to
say whether there were any casualties in the blast.
