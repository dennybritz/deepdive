Continental, the German maker of tyres and car parts, said
Wednesday it has agreed to buy a 51-percent stake in the rubber
and conveyor belt business of Matador Group of Slovakia.


Financial details were not disclosed, but Puchov-based Matador
Group has annual sales of 450 million euros (603 million dollars)
and employs a workforce of 4,700, Continental said in a
statement.


The move would enable the German group to expand its operational
base in Eastern Europe "as well our production capacities for car
tyres in low-cost countries," said chief executive Manfred
Wennemer.


"In combining forces and experience, we will improve our market
positions in central and eastern Europe and get additional sales
opportunities in Russia, Ukraine and the 'Stan' states," Wennemer
said.


Continental and Matador already operate a joint venture for truck
tyres in Puchov since 1998.


"With this strategic alliance, we will further improve the
quality and volume of Matador tyre production, open new markets
and increase the value of the Matador brand," said Matador CEO,
Stefan Rosina.
