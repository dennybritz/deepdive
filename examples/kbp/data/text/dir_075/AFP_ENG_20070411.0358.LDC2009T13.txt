US stocks opened slightly lower Wednesday as Alcoa opened the
corporate earnings season with a positive report, but the market
faced consolidation after eight winning days for blue chips.


In the first exchanges, the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted
down 4.71 points (0.04 percent) to 12,569.14.


The Nasdaq composite fell 3.60 points (0.15 percent) to 2,474.01
and the Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index shed 1.41
points (0.10 percent) to 1,446.98.


A positive tone came from Alcoa, the first of the major firms to
report earnings, which said profits rose to a better-than-
expected 662 million dollars.


But analysts said the market was running into some resistance
after the Dow


blue-chip index posted eight consecutive winning sessions in its
best streak since 2003.


"We continue to be modestly optimistic that the stock market will
come through first quarter earnings season in reasonably decent
shape," said Fred Dickson, market strategist at DA Davidson.


"The good news is that the market is holding recent gains on very
light trading volume days. The bears simply are not anxious to
take profits."
