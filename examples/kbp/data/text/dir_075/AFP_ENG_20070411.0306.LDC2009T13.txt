Anti-nuclear protestors blocked border crossings between Austria
and the Czech Republic Wednesday to denounce security failings at
a Czech power plant, one of the organisers said.


"About 100 people alternately blocked the seven border posts
between Austria and the Czech Republic for an hour in the
morning," Roland Egger, spokesman for the 'Atomstopp' group said.


The organisation is calling for the closure of the Soviet-
designed Temelin plant, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the
Austrian-Czech border, where a number of leaks have occurred.


Austrian anti-nuclear demonstrators who regularly stage border
blockades have threatened to bolster their movement if no
progress is made in talks between Prague and Vienna.


Atomstopp wants Vienna to take the case against Prague to an
international court, after the Austrian parliament agreed a
resolution on the matter in a vote in December.


Anti-nuclear protestors have also called on an Austrian regional
governor to address the issue of safety at Temelin during his
talks Wednesday with a Czech regional official.


Austrian Environment Minister Josef Proell also said Wednesday
that he was awaiting legal reports on Temelin before deciding
whether to lodge a case of violation of international public law.


Last month, the head of the Czech Republic's nuclear power
watchdog said  the frequency of leaks at the Temelin power plant
was "unacceptable" after the leak of about 1,000 litres of mildly
radioactive water, which had followed a similar incident a week
earlier.


Austria banned the use of nuclear energy in its constitution
after a referendum in 1978.
