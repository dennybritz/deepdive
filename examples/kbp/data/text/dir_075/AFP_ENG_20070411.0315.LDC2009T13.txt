Heavy fighting between government troops and Tamil Tigers in
northern Sri Lanka has left 21 people dead on both sides, the
defence ministry said Wednesday.


The clashes erupted when rebels fired mortars against military
positions late Tuesday across a front line at Omanthai, the main
crossing point between government- and Tiger-held territory.


The ministry said one government soldier was killed and four
others wounded, adding intercepted rebel radio communication
showed 20 rebels were killed in the military retaliation.


However, Tamil Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan denied losing
20 fighters and placed rebel casualties at three dead. He said
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) recovered the bodies
of eight Sri Lankan troops.


The Omanthai crossing was shut for the second straight day
Wednesday following the shelling.


The military said the LTTE were shelling government positions to
obstruct the transport of supplies across the front line.


The International Red Cross this week expressed concern over a
sharp rise in civilian deaths in the northern and eastern
regions.


Journalists have not been allowed into rebel-held areas by Sri
Lankan authorities since April last year.


On Saturday, suspected rebels blew up a passenger bus in the
northern district of Vavuniya, killing eight people and wounding
25.


More than 4,000 people died between December 2005 and the first
week of March 2007, including 675 civilians and 1,040 security
personnel, according to defence ministry figures.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.
