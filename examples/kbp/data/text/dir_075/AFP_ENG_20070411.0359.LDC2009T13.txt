Tatiana Golovin will spearhead France's Fed Cup World Group first
round campaign against Japan at home from April 21-22, team
captain Georges Goven announced Wednesday.


The 19-year-old Golovin, fresh from winning her first WTA title
at Amelia Island, Florida last weekend steps in for French number
one Amelie Mauresmo, who is recovering following surgery for
appendicitis.


Severine Bremond, Nathalie Dechy and Virginie Razzano will
complete the home team for the tie scheduled for the Palais des
Sports Beaublanc in the central town of Limoges.


This will be the seventh meeting between the two nations with
France holding a 5-1 advantage. At their last meeting in 1997
France beat Japan 4-1 in Tokyo.
