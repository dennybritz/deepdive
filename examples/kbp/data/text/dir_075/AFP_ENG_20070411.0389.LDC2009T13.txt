Bangladesh were 35-3 after 10 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against England at the Kensington Oval here on
Wednesday.


Mushfiqur Rahim was seven not out with Saqibul Hasan on four.


England had won the toss and eleced to field and the decision
paid off as Bangladesh collapsed.


Tamim Iqbal was caught by Paul Collingwood off Sajid Mahmood for
eight with skipper Habibul Bashar run out for four to make the
score 23-2 in six overs.


Shahriar Nafees was the third man out, caught by Andrew Strauss
off Mahmood for nine in the eighth over with the score on 26.


England remained unchanged from their seven-wicket defeat against
Australia in Antigua on Sunday, while Bangladesh brought back
vice-captain Shahriar Nafees in place of Javed Omar from their
team which upset South Africa by 67 runs in Georgetown, Guyana
last week.
