Global banking giant Citigroup will cut some 17,000 jobs as part
of a major overhaul of its operations, the company announced on
Wednesday.


The company, under pressure from leading shareholders to reduce
costs, said the move was the result of a comprehensive review of
expenses over three months.


"As a result of the structural changes identified in the review,
Citi will eliminate approximately 17,000 positions," the company
said in a statement.


It also said that more than 9,500 jobs will be transferred to
"lower-cost locations" in the United States and abroad.


"Ultimately these changes will streamline Citi and make us
leaner, more efficient, and better able to take advantage of high
revenue opportunities," said Charles Prince, chairman and chief
executive officer.


The cost cuts are expected to generate total expense savings of
approximately 2.1 billion dollars in 2007, 3.7 billion in 2008,
and 4.6 billion in 2009, Citigroup said.


Citigroup employs some 327,000 people and the job cuts represent
about five percent of its staff.
