Eurozone economic momentum is set to eclipse growth in the United
States this year for the first time since 2001, a pace that could
justify a hike in interest rates by September, the IMF said
Wednesday.


The International Monetary Fund in its twice-yearly assessment of
the global economy also warned that growth in the 13-nation zone
would slow next year and called for tighter budgets that would
nonetheless allow for greater spending on information technology.
