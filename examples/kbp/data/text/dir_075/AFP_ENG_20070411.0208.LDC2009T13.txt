Nasdaq, the premier US electronic exchange, is in talks to buy
the country's oldest stock market, the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.


Citing sources close to the deal, the Journal said such a
takeover would cement the 36-year-old Nasdaq's position in the
options market, the Philadelphia exchange's strong point.


The Philadelphia exchange is valued at between 250 and 300
million dollars, according to the newspaper's sources.


The two bourses have been in talks for several months, but so far
there is no clear sign that Nasdaq will make a formal offer,
according to the Journal's source.


The move comes two months after Nasdaq was blocked in its
aggressive bid for the venerable London Stock Exchange.


In a sign of the trend toward global securities market
consolidation, Nasdaq's main domestic rival, the New York Stock
Exchange, reacted by offering to merge with Euronext, the Paris-
based pan-European stock exchange. That deal is expected to be
finalized later this year.


Meanwhile in the derivatives sector, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange are battling to take
over the Chicago Board of Trade.
