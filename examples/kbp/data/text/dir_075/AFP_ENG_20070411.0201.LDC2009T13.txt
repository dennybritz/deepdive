Thailand's army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont left
hospital Wednesday after three days of medical checks, insisting
that he is in fine health.


"It's like a car. Once it has been used for a while, it needs a
check-up. My health is fine considering my age. I am ready to
work, although I'm not in as good condition as a new car," he
told reporters.


Surayud looked pale and weak as he left the hospital where he was
admitted Monday for an unscheduled medical check-up, amid
increasing political tension in Bangkok and rumours that he might
resign.


"Everything is fine and no serious illness was found," Major
General Parinya Thaweechaikarn, his personal physician, told
reporters.


"The prime minister has started eating mild food after eating
only clear soup for two days," he said.


While resting at hospital, Surayud has dealt with paperwork and
received regular reports on government affairs from his
secretary, Parinya said.


Government spokesman Yongyuth Mayalarp said Surayud was scheduled
to return to work Thursday, when he was also expected to speak to
reporters.


Surayud's aides have rejected any suggestion that he might
resign, and denied reports of a split between the premier and
Thailand's junta leader Sonthi Boonyaratglin.


Surayud, a former army chief, was installed after the military
ousted elected premier Thaksin Shinawatra in a September coup.


Although many in Bangkok welcomed the coup, Surayud's popularity
has steadily fallen in polls.
