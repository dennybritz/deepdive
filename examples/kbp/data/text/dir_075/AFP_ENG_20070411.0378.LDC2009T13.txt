Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on Wednesday
expressed his "strong condemnation" of the two car bomb attacks
that killed at least 17 people in Algiers.


In a telegram sent to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,
Zapatero said he "was profoundly moved by the terrible news of
the tragic terrorist attacks perpetrated today in Algiers."


"I want to express in my name and in the name of the government
of Spain my most profound solidarity and my strong condemnation."


Twenty-nine mainly Moroccan accused are on trial in Spain for the
March 11, 2004 train bombings in Madrid which killed 191 people
and wounded hundreds in the country's worst terrorist attack.
