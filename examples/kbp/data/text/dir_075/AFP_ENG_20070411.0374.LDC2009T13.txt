France expressed horror on Wednesday after twin car bomb attacks
left 17 dead and scores injured in Algeria and pledged support
for its "fight against terrorism."


"I express my horror and indignation following the attacks that
have just hit Algiers," said Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-
Blazy in a statement.


"I wish to reassure the Algerian authorities of our full
solidarity in their fight against terrorism," he said.


Two car bomb attacks rocked Algiers, killing at least 17 people
and injuring more than 100 outside the government headquarters
and on the road to the international airport.


Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attacks came as
Algeria, a former French colony, and neighbouring Morocco battle
mounting Islamic extremism.
