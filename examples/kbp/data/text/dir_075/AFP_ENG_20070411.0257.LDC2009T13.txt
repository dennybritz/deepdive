French free-diving champion Loic Leferme died Wednesday in a
training accident at Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean
coast, police said.


Leferme, 36, suffered a heart attack and emergency workers called
to the scene were unable to save him.


Leferme held the world record in the "No Limits" category of
free-diving, after descending to a depth of 171 metres (564 feet)
with only the air in his lungs in 2004.
