A suicide bomb exploded near a NATO-led military convoy in
Afghanistan's main southern city of Kandahar on Wednesday, but
there was no word on casualties, police said.


"There was a suicide bombing against a NATO convoy in Kandahar
city," provincial police chief Esmatullah Alizai told AFP.


"There is no immediate information on casualties."


Kandahar, the heartland of the Taliban before their ouster in
late 2001 by a US- led invasion, is one of the most violent
regions in insurgency-hit southern Afghanistan.


Thousands of foreign troops, mainly from the NATO-led
International Security Assistance Force, are based in Kandahar.
