A Sri Lankan brewer offered compensation on Wednesday to victims
of a collision between a beer truck and a bus in which 23 people
were killed.


Twenty-three people died and 57 were injured in Tuesday's head-on
crash in the coastal resort town of Induruwa, 70 kilometres (43
miles) south of Colombo.


Most of the victims were trapped in the wreckage and burnt to
death as a fire engulfed both vehicles, police said, adding that
eight women, a five-year-old child and both drivers were among
the dead.


Lion Brewery Ceylon Ltd was offering 1,200 dollars to the next of
kin of those killed while survivors would be paid 230 dollars
each, director Ranil Gunatilake said.


Police said initial investigations showed both drivers were at
fault.


Sri Lankan roads are some of the most dangerous in the world,
with accidents claiming at least 2,000 lives each year on a
poorly maintained network choked with more than two million
vehicles.
