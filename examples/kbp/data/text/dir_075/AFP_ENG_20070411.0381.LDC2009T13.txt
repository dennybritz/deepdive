Television star and former US senator Fred Thompson, who is
mulling a bid for the White House, announced Wednesday he has a
treatable form of cancer.


In an interview with Fox News, Fred Thompson, star of the
courtroom drama "Law and Order," and a former Republican senator
from Tennessee said he is in remission from a treatable form of
lymphoma.


"I have had no illness from it, or even any symptoms. My life
expectancy should not be affected," Thompson said.


"I am in remission, and it is very treatable with drugs if
treatment is needed in the future -- and with no debilitating
side effects."


Thompson, 64, said he was diagnosed with indolent lymphoma about
two and a half years ago after a routine physical.


A month ago, Thompson said he was considering running for
president in 2008.


Before becoming an actor, Thompson was a Washington lawyer,
representing the Republicans during the "Watergate" scandal that
led to the resignation of president Richard Nixon.


He has made a career portraying presidents and politicos on the
screen.


Cancer has already entered the White House race as an unwelcome
guest, with Democratic party hopeful John Edwards revealing last
month that his wife, Elizabeth, has incurable cancer which has
now spread to her bones.


Elizabeth Edwards is emerging as a crusader against the killer
disease as she refuses to give in to her illness to stand by her
husband in his 2008 White House bid.
