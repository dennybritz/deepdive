Voters in Madagascar have overwhelmingly endorsed constitutional
reforms to increase presidential powers and make English an
official language in the former French colony, according to final
results released Wednesday.


The results showed 75.38 percent of voters backing the changes
that would also strip six provinces of their autonomy in addition
to empowering the head of state to legislate by decree in
emergency situations.


Wednesday's final results confirmed early indications from the
referendum vote which was held a week ago.


"We received 98 percent of the results after three days, but we
had to wait for (results) from nine far-flung polling stations,"
Theodore Randriamahenina, an official with the interior ministry,
said.


However, the results have still to be approved by the
Constitutional Court which has thus far received returns from 88
out of the country's 116 districts.


"I don't think that we will be able to validate the results next
week," said Samuel Ralison, a registrar of the Conatitutional
Court.


Last week's voting was marred by bad weather and saw a turnout of
43.72 percent.


Opposition members have complained that the exercise was marred
by fraud, but have not provided any proof.
