Consumer prices in Lithuania rose by 0.6 percent in March
compared to the previous month, putting 12-month inflation at 4.6
percent, official data showed Thursday.


Average inflation over the 12 months to March, a different
measurement but a key criteria for countries wishing to adopt the
euro, measured 4.0 percent.


Lithuania had been planning to swap its national currency, the
litas, for the euro from the beginning of 2007.


The European Commission, however, shut the door because the
Baltic state narrowly failed to meet strict EU-set inflation
criteria for would-be eurozone members.


Under the EU's Maastricht criteria, inflation in future eurozone
members must stand at the average of the three lowest rates in
the now 27-member EU, plus 1.5 percent.


In February, the EU-set benchmark was 2.93 percent.


When Lithuania's euro ambitions were put on hold last year,
annual average inflation in the Baltic state was just one-tenth
of a percentage point above the then benchmark of 2.6 percent.


Lithuania, which joined the EU in 2004, now plans to make the
switch to the single European currency in 2010-2011.
