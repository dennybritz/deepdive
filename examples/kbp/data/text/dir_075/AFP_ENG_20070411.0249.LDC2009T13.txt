Japan and China, issuing their first joint statement on relations
in nearly a decade, agreed Wednesday to "look frankly" at history
and support a "constructive" world role for each power.


Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
agreed "to look at history frankly and jointly build a beautiful
future for the bilateral relationship," the joint statement said.


China has accused Japan of not atoning for its past aggression
and cited the issue to scuttle Tokyo's cherished bid for a
permanent seat on the UN Security Council.


"China said Japan should play a more constructive role in the
international community," the statement said, without explicitly
backing the UN bid.


The Asian powers should "assume the responsibilities given to
both countries in the new era," it said.


It was the first joint statement from a Japan-China summit since
1998 when China's then president Jiang Zemin visited Tokyo.
