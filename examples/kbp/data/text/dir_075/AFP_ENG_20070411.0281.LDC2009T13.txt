French luxury goods group PPR will not pay a higher price than it
has offered already for Puma, the German maker of sportsgear, a
spokesman said on Wednesday.


He was reacting to a hint in Frankfurt from the German company's
chief executive Jochen Zeitz that a higher takeover bid from PPR
was possible.


"It is a price that fully values Puma and it is the price at
which the Herz family agreed to sell its share," the PPR
spokesman told AFP.


"That amounts to a significiant premium (of 19 percent) compared
to the last Puma (share) price on April 3, before the
speculation," the spokesman said.


In early afternoon trade shares in PPR slipped 1.56 percent to
130.96 euros, in a Paris market which had gained 0.42 percent.


Puma chief executive Zeitz had told ZDF public television
earlier: "Fundamentally, the price (of 330 euros per share)
stands. But we'll see."


On Tuesday, PPR, owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, offered
330 euros per share or 5.3 billion euros for Puma after acquiring
a stake of 27.1 percent in the sports shoe maker from the
controlling Herz family.


But investors appear to be speculating on an even higher price,
with Puma shares changing hands at 349 euros on the Frankfurt
stock exchange on Wednesday, up 1.47 percent on the day after
already shooting up 9.44 percent on Tuesday.
