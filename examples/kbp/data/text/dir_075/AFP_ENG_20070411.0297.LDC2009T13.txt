Female bureaucrats in India have complained about intrusive
questions in a new annual review form asking for their menstrual
history and smear tests, a report said Wednesday.


The performance appraisal form introduced by the Ministry of
Personnel in March has a three-page health section that asks
women for a "detailed menstrual history," according to a copy of
the questionnaire seen by AFP.


Female civil servants in at least one state were irate at the
questions, a report in the Hindustan Times daily said Wednesday.


"The questions are too intrusive and have no bearing on our
work," said Seema Vyas, a senior civil servant in the western
Indian state of Maharashtra.


The form also asks officers for information on their "last
confinement," and about their pap smears and mammograms.


Senior female officers labelled the queries "insensitive" and
said they were considering sending a protest letter to the
central government.


A bureaucrat with the Ministry of Personnel said he had received
no complaints so far.


"We sought the (health) ministry's help to draw up a health-
history format," Satyanand Mishra, a senior officer, told the
Hindustan Times.


"I assume this will help evaluate the officers' fitness."
