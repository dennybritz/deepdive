The city-state authorities of Berlin said Wednesday that they
would allow seven potential bidders access to the books of
Landesbank Berlin (LBB) as part of the planned sale of the
regional bank.


Out of nine candidates which had offered serious, but non-binding
bids for LBB so far, seven had now been short-listed.


They would be given access to the bank's data room in the so-
called due diligence process, after which they would be required
to submit binding offers, Berlin's financial senate said in a
statement.


After that, the city-state authorities would select candidates
with which it would hold concrete takeover talks.


Berlin has been ordered to sell its 80.95-percent stake in LBB,
which is already listed on the stock exchange, by the EU
competition authorities.


A whole range of public and private sector banks had expressed an
interest in LBB, including German private sector banks
Commerzbank and HypoVereinsbank and the public sector banks,
BayernLB, LBBW and WestLB.


But financial investors such as US private equity funds JC
Flowers, Lonestar and Cerberus are also believed to be in the
running.


Last month, the Berlin authorities indicated that they were also
considering floating the stake on the stock exchange by way of a
so-called secondary public offering (SPO) as an alternative to a
straightforward sale.


A secondary public offering is the issuance of new stock for
public sale from a company that is already listed.
