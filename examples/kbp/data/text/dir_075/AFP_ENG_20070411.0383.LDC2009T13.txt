The White House on Wednesday ruled out releasing five Iranians
held in Iraq, after Tehran warned it was unlikely to attend a May
conference on Iraq's security unless they were freed.


Asked whether the United States would consider releasing the
five, whom US forces detained in a January raid in northern Iraq,
national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe replied: "No."
