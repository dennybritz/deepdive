Croatia, working with neighbouring countries, has broken up five
people smuggling rings and arrested almost 40 suspected
traffickers, police said Wednesday.


The operation with Bosnian, Italian, Montenegrin and Slovenian
police was launched on Tuesday throughout Croatia, police chief
Darko Dumancic said.


"Following searches of 28 apartments and houses, during which 17
illegal immigrants were found ... 39 Croatian nationals were
detained," he told reporters.


Sixty-two people were suspected of being involved in the
trafficking rings. Fifty-two of them were Croatian, four Bosnian
and six Slovenian.


Since mid-2005, the traffickers had smuggled at least 1,000
illegal ethnic Albanian immigrants through Bosnia, Croatia and
Slovenia towards Western Europe, said Dumancic.


The traffickers were estimated to have earned more than one
million euros (1.3 million dollars) after charging each
individual between 1,000 and 1,500 euros and paying off guides
and drivers.


"It is one of the largest actions conducted by Croatian police in
cooperation with police of other countries," said Dinko Cvitan,
the head of Croatia's organised crime office.


According to Croatian law, human traffickers can be jailed for to
up to 10 years.


Croatia lies on the so-called Balkans route used by criminal
groups to smuggle people and would-be illegal migrations from
developing countries towards Western Europe.
