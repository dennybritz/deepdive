Indian share prices edged lower on Wednesday, snapping five
straight days of gains as buyers turned cautious ahead of the
earnings season which kicks off Friday, dealers said.


They said investors would await direction from earnings and
guidance from software export heavyweight Infosys Technologies on
Friday.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex fell 6.30
points or 0.05 percent to 13,183.24 in choppy trade.


"The market shed its early morning gains. Activity will improve
only after Infosys earnings come in. A correction is likely if
software sector earnings disappoint," said Manoj Kakaiya, dealer
with brokerage ULJK Securities.


India's largest private sector carrier Jet Airways fell 35.95
rupees or 5.57 percent to 608.9 after analysts raised concerns
over the pricing of a possible deal to buy out domestic rival Air
Sahara.


Jet Airways said on Tuesday it had revived talks to take over Air
Sahara after an earlier proposed 500-million-dollar deal
collapsed in June last year.


Gainers led losers 1,532 to 1,038 on volume of 38.47 billion
rupees (897 million dollars).


The rupee was flat against the dollar at 42.8 and against the
euro at 57.5.


Private sector Tata Steel rose 16.3 rupees or 3.29 percent to
511.8, while drug exporter Dr Reddy Laboratories fell 12.5 rupees
or 3.49 percent to 345.3.
