Chinese and Japanese leaders pledged Wednesday to cooperate for
the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.


Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
promised in a joint statement "cooperation in six-party talks" on
North Korea's disarmament that are being held in Beijing.


The two leaders agreed to "jointly promote efforts for the
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula through dialogue and
negotiations," it said.


The statement also said China shared Japan's concerns over the
plight of Japanese nationals abducted by Pyongyang, a
domestically sensitive issue here.


The two leaders met at a time of hectic diplomacy over North
Korea, which has demanded it receive funds from a blacklisted
bank account before shutting down a nuclear reactor.


New Mexico state governor Bill Richardson, who visited Pyongyang,
said Wednesday that North Korea had agreed to act within a day of
seeing the money that has been unfrozen at Macau's Banco Delta
Asia (BDA).


"The BDA issue has been resolved at the political level. Now the
countries concerned must resolve the BDA issue," Wen told Abe in
their meeting, as quoted by the Japanese leader's aide Hiroshige
Seko.
