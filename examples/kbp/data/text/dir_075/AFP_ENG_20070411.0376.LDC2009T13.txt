Kazakh non-governmental organisations back the idea of the
country assuming the presidency of the Organisation for Security
and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the OSCE chief said Wednesday.


"I met this morning with representatives of NGOs and opposition
political parties and they expressed their support of the whole
of civil society to the Kazakh candidacy to the OSCE presidency,"
Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said.


"There is a unanimous desire on the part of the president and of
Kazakh civil society to make this presidency succeed," he added.


Moratinos was speaking a day after meeting President Nursultan
Nazarbayev in the Kazakh capital.


Last December, OSCE foreign ministers were unable to agree on
handing Kazakhstan the organisation's presidency in 2009.


Their reservations were due to criticism of the oil-rich Central
Asian state's human rights record including accusations of rigged
elections and restrictions on freedom of expression.


The European Union has indicated that it would support the Kazakh
initiative if the country implemented significant democratic
reforms this year.


Nazarbayev's re-election in 2005 with 91 percent of the vote met
harsh criticism from the OSCE.


But he has vowed to launch judicial reforms and to change laws
concerning elections, the media and the recognition of political
parties.
