Amnesty International on Wednesday strongly condemned what it
termed the "systematic abuses" of human rights in Egypt,
particularly in light of recently passed amendments to the
constitution.


Wide powers for security services, systematic torture of
detainees, the use of unjust courts were all cited by the report
from the London-based rights organisation as evidence of a
worsening situation in Egypt where even the few constitutional
protections are being rolled back.


"I would say that it is worse in the sense that the few
safeguards that we had in the constitution are now being
attacked," Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty's Middle East deputy
director told reporters, referring to the amendments passed in a
sparsely attended referendum March 26.


The report in particular highlighted a new anti-terrorism law
being prepared by the government to replace the old emergency
law.


"What we see and we fear with the new law is a broad definition
of terrorism crime that would criminalise the peaceful excercise
of rights that are guaranteed internationally," she added.


The report, "Systematic abuses in the name of security", also
highlights how the United States and other countries used the
process of "renditions" to send terrorism suspects to Egypt to be
interrogated, in contravention of international law.
