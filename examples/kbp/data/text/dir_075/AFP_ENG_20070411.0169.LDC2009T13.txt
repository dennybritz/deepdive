Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is due to meet Palestinian
president Mahmud Abbas on Sunday, his office said on Wednesday.


"Olmert and Abbas will meet on Sunday for a regular periodical
meeting which will focus on security issues and ongoing bilateral
ties," spokeswoman Miri Eisin told AFP.


The exact location of their meeting was not determined, but
Olmert has said in the past that he would be ready to meet Abbas
in a Palestinian city and not only in Jerusalem, where their
previous meetings had taken place.


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced last month while
visiting the region that the two leaders agreed to hold biweekly
talks to strengthen ties but which were not planned to focus on
peace talks.
