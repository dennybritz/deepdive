World oil prices nudged higher on Wednesday as traders awaited US
inventories data that was expected to show further falls in
gasoline stocks.


The price of Brent North Sea crude for May delivery added 34
cents to 67.76 dollars per barrel in London electronic trading on
Wednesday.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, gained just one cent to 61.90 dollars per barrel
in electronic deals before the official open of the US market.


The US Department of Energy was set Wednesday to publish its
latest update on oil inventories in the United States last week.


All eyes will be on gasoline or petrol stockpiles, which are a
crucial focus for the market ahead of the so-called US driving
season, dealers said.


The peak-demand driving season starts next month and sees many
Americans hit the roads for their summer vacations.
