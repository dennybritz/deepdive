Italian energy group Enel and Spanish partner Acciona are to
offer 41.3 euros per share for Spanish utility Endesa valuing the
company at 43.7 billion euros (58.7 billion dollars), a statement
sent to the Spanish stock market regulator said on Wednesday.


The two companies had previously said they would launch a
takeover for Endesa at at least 41 euros a share.


Enel and Acciona control about 46 percent of Endesa already.


Trading in shares in Endesa had been suspended earlier on the
Madrid stock exchange. The share rose only slightly after the
price announcement, adding 0.40 percent to 40.41 euros on an
overall market that showed a gain of 0.24 percent.


German energy group E.ON, which had been trying to buy Endesa
since February 2006, announced last week that it had abandoned
its takeover bid for Endesa after reaching an agreement with Enel
and Acciona.


Under the accord E.ON is to buy assets worth about 10 billion
euros from Endesa if Enel and Acciona succeed with their takeover
offer.
