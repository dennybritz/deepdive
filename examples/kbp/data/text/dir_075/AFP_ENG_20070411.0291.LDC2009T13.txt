Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is visit Egypt later this
month, ahead of two international conferences the country is to
host in a bid to stabilise Iraq, a source in his office said on
Wednesday.


"Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is to pay a visit to Egypt on an
official invitation," said the official, speaking to AFP on
condition of anonymity and adding that the exact date had not yet
been finalised.


"He is going to discuss a host of common interests," the official
added.


Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari announced on Saturday that
a ministerial meeting of its neighbouring countries and world
powers will be held in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
between May 3-4.


His ministry said the conference would be held right after a
meeting of the International Compact Group on Iraq, a joint
initiative between the United Nations and World Bank also taking
place in Egypt.
