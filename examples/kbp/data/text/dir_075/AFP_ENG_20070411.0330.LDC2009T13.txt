China's economy will likely grow 10.0 percent this year and 9.5
percent next year, the International Monetary Fund said in a key
report Wednesday.


The figure is down from the high of 10.7 percent last year but
still shows "rapid" expansion, it said, cautioning that the
Chinese economy, the world's fourth largest, could once again
confound predictions and perform even better than expected.


The IMF's economic outlook report said that taken overall, Asia's
emerging economies would see 8.4 percent growth this year, with
India also performing strongly at 8.4 percent this year and 7.8
percent in 2008.
