A succession of bomb explosions rocked the Algerian capital in
quick succession on Wednesday, leaving 17 dead and 82 wounded,
witnesses and authorities said.


Witnesses said a car bomb exploded at the entrance to the seat of
government, shaking buildings and sending shattered glass flying
over a distance of 200 to 300 meters (yards).


The civil defence agency said nine people were killed and 32
wounded.


Almost simultaneous blasts left eight dead and 50 injured near a
police station in the eastern suburb of Bab Ezzouar.


Residents said three car bombs had exploded in Bab Ezzouar, near
the international airport, badly damaging the police station and
destroying an electricity sub-station.


Ambulances and police cars immediately rushed to the multi-storey
government headquarters, which also houses several ministries.


A thick cloud of smoke rose from the site of the blast, which was
heard across the city.


Thousands of passersby congregated on the vast steps of the
building, as uniformed and plainclothes police attempted to
contain the crowd.


The Algerian army recently conducted an offensive in the eastern
region of Kabylie against an Islamist militant group that has
claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks in Algeria
and is also active in other countries, notably Tunisia


At least 20 Islamists and three soldiers were killed in the
operation to flush out members of the former Salafist Group for
Preaching and Combat (GSPC), which recently renamed itself the
branch of Al-Qaeda in north Africa.
