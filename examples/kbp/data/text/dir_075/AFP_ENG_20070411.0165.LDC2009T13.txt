Turkey has not suspended talks with Gaz de France (GDF) over the
proposed acquisition by the French group of a stake in a major
gas pipeline project, Energy Minister Hilmi Guler said on
Wednesday.


"Nabucco (the pipeline) is a very important project for us and
the process is continuing as normal. Gaz de France has not been
suspended from the project," Guler was quoted by Turkish
television as telling reporters here.


A press report claimed last Thursday that the talks had been
suspended because of a political row sparked by French pressure
to label Turkish action against Armenians during World War I as
genocide.


The consortium building Nabucco is seeking a sixth partner for
the six-billion- dollar (4.5-billion-euro) project, with GDF seen
as the leading candidate.


Guler said that Turkey would take a final decision on the sixth
partner "according to its national interests."


He said that economic, strategic and political interests,
including France's stance on the Armenian genocide issue, would
be taken into account when choosing.


The current five-company Nabucco consortium involving BOTAS plans
to build a 3,300-kilometre (2,000-mile) pipeline that will carry
natural gas from the Middle East and Central Asia to the European
Union via Turkey and the Balkans, bypassing Russia.


The other partners in Nabucco are Austria's oil and gas group
OMV, Hungary's MOL, Bulgaria's Bulgargaz and Romania's Transgaz.
