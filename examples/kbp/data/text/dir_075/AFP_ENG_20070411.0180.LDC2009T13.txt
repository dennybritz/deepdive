Dozens of people were injured Wednesday in a car bomb attack at
the entrance to the seat of government in the Algerian capital,
Algiers, witnesses said.


The explosion, which shook several buildings, was heard all over
the city.


Ambulances and police cars immediately rushed to the multi-storey
building, which also houses several ministries.
