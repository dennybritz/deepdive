US pop singer Willa Ford is set to play Anna Nicole Smith in an
independent film about the late former Playboy model's life, it
was reported on Wednesday.


Ford, who became known as the "Bad Girl of Pop" after the release
of her first album in 2001, will begin filming the biopic next
week, entertainment daily Variety reported.


The 26-year-old bears a striking physical resemblance to Smith
and like the blonde tabloid icon she will play, has also posed
for Playboy and taken part in reality television shows.


Variety reported that the film would cover Smith's life from her
days as a teenager up until her death from an accidental overdose
in Florida in February at the age of 39.


Ford is best known for her platinum-selling single "I Wanna Be
Bad" and her debut album "Willa Was Here."


News of the biopic comes after a judge in the Bahamas on Tuesday
ruled that Smith's former boyfriend Larry Birkhead was the father
of her seven-month-old daughter Dannielynn.
