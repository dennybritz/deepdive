Three members of the Jackson musical clan are to take part in a
US reality television show aimed at unearthing a new superstar
pop family, entertainment media reported on Wednesday.


The daily Variety reported that former Jackson Five members
Jermaine and Tito along with sister LaToya, will be the judges on
the show, which will be titled "Pop Dynasty".


However the two highest-profile members of the Jackson family --
Michael and Janet -- were not expected to be involved with the
series, the report said.


The show will be the latest project aiming to emulate the success
of hit series "American Idol", the program which seeks to uncover
new pop stars and is the most popular show on US television.
