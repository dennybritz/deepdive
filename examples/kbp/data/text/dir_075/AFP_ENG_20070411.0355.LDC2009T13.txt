Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko could delay implementation
of his order to dissolve parliment and hold snap polls, a top
adviser said Wednesday, signalling a possible concession in the
political crisis gripping the country.


Vitaly Gaiduk, secretary of the state security and national
defence council, said Yushchenko "does not exclude suspending the
decree."


The presidential decree issued earlier this month ordered the
dissolution of parliament, which is controlled by anti-Yushchenko
forces, and the holding of elections on May 27.


The parliamentary majority, led by Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych, has refused to obey.


Suspending the order would mean putting off the date for new
elections, which must take place 60 days after dissolution of the
legislature.


The constitutional court is due next week to start hearings on
the legality of the decree.
