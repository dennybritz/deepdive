EU regulators took the first step on Wednesday towards taking
legal action against a suspected cartel in the shipping sector.


The European Commission said it had sent formal charge-sheets to
companies that ship bulk liquids by sea on suspicions that they
had carved up the market among themselves, rigged bids, fixed
prices and shared sensitive information.


The EU's competition watchdog said it was taking the action based
on evidence against the unnamed companies gathered during
surprise inspections carried out in February 2003.


Under EU rules, the companies now have two months to defend
themselves in writing against the accusations.


If regulators are not satisfied with the answers, they can slap
fines of up to 10 percent of the companies' worldwide annual
revenues.


EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has made a "no-
tolerance" crackdown on cartels a top priority and has lodged
ever-rising record fines against them.


Most recently, the Dutch commissioner imposed the biggest fine
ever in a EU cartel case by bringing an illegal club of lift
makers crashing down in February with a penalty of 992 million
euros (1.3 billion dollars).


Last month her team of trustbusters launched separate legal
actions against suspected cartels making professional-quality
videotape, glass and bathroom fittings.


She also said last month that she expected to break up as many as
nine or 10 cartels this year and set a new record in annual fines
handed out to offending firms.
