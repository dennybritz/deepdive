Bomb blasts in the Algerian capital Wednesday killed 23 people
and injured 162, the civil defence agency said, giving an updated
toll and warning that the casualty figure could increase.


The agency said that an explosion at the government headquarters
left 12 dead and 118 injured, while 11 people were killed and 44
wounded in an almost simultaneous attack near a police station in
an eastern suburb.


The toll from the first attack "could become heavier," a
statement said.
