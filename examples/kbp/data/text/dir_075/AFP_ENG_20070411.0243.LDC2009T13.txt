US warplanes bombed Taliban militants who had attacked coalition
and Afghan troops in southern Afghanistan, killing 13 and
destroying a vehicle and bunker, the coalition said Wednesday.


Taliban insurgents attacked the soldiers with mortar rounds and
rocket-propelled grenades in the troubled Sangin district of
southern Helmand province on Tuesday, it said in a statement.


"The ANA (Afghan National Army) and coalition force returned
mortar fire, then manoeuvred to an observation position to
request close air support," it said.


"Coalition aircraft arrived and dropped munitions, which resulted
in the destruction of one enemy compound, a bunker and a vehicle.
There were an estimated 13 Taliban fighters killed during the
engagement," it added.


There were no civilian casualties, it said.


The airstrike came a day after coalition jets killed four Taliban
fighters in Sangin district.


About 1,000 Afghan security forces and NATO-led troops took
Sangin out of Taliban control at the weekend without facing any
major resistance, according to authorities.


"We will intensify our operations to rid the area of Taliban
fighters and prevent their return," coalition spokesman Major
Chris Belcher said in the statement.


Helmand is one of the most violent provinces in Afghanistan,
where drug traffickers are said to fund the Taliban.


The fundamentalist Taliban were ousted by a US-led invasion after
the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, but have
since launched a bloody insurgency.


Nearly 1,000 people have died in Taliban-related violence this
year, most of them militants, according to an AFP tally based on
reports.
