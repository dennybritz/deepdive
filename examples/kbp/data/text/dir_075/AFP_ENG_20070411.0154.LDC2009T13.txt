Meetings by the European Rugby Cup directors and shareholders
will be held here on Wednesday following the decision by French
and English clubs to boycott next year's competition.


The clubs said because demands to earn the same shareholding and
voting rights as their respective national federations were not
met, they decided not to compete in the 2007/08 season.


The matter will be top of the agenda in Dublin with the six
unions - England, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Italy -
determined to find a solution.


They also have the support of the International Rugby Board,
whose chairman Syd Millar launched an astonishing attack on the
Anglo-French clubs. Unless an agreement can be reached, the cost
to the game will be huge and, in the case of professional rugby
in cash-strapped Scotland, potentially fatal.


If European Cup and European Challenge Cup have to be abandoned
for one season, the Celtic unions will lose in the region of two
million pounds each.


Scottish rugby is already 20 million pounds (29 million euros) in
debt and doubts whether it could survive without the ERC cash.


The Anglo-French clubs claim the RFU have reneged on an agreement
struck last autumn, something the Twickenham top brass flatly
deny.


The language has grown increasingly emotive over the last week as
the two sides grew further entrenched.


But on Tuesday night there appeared to be fresh impetus from the
clubs to reach a solution as both Premier Rugby and their
counterparts in France responded to the IRB rebuke with positive
action.
