A man sliced off his tongue at a Hindu temple and offered it to
the Hindu goddess of revenge, police said Wednesday.


Suresh Kumar, 24, told police in a written statement late Tuesday
that he had seen visions of the goddess Kali -- the most fearsome
of Hindu deities -- in his dreams.


Kumar, a supervisor at a government employment centre, wrote that
he had been worshipping the goddess known as "the black one with
the red tongue" in a search for justice after his elder brother
was murdered in September 2005.


On Tuesday, Kumar, from Seot village, 28 kilometres (17 miles)
from Jammu, the winter capital of Indian-held Kashmir, went to
pray at the popular Mahakali temple.


Once inside, he took out a sharp knife and presented his bloody
tongue to priests to make an offering to Kali.


The priests and shocked devotees called police and Kumar was
rushed to the hospital, a police spokesman said.


Doctors operated on Kumar, Jammu Medical College medical
superintendent Yashpaul Sharma said, adding it was unclear
whether he would ever be able to speak again.
