Consumer prices in Latvia rose by 1.4 percent in March on a
monthly basis, putting inflation over 12 months at 8.5 percent,
the national statistics bureau said Wednesday.


Increases in the prices of clothing and footwear after the end of
the winter sales season, as well as of food products and catering
services, had the greatest impact on price changes in March,
official data showed.


Inflation has been rising progressively in Latvia, fuelling
jitters about economic overheating in the Baltic state whose
growth is the highest in the EU.


In December, 12-month inflation was at 6.8 percent, in January at
7.1 percent and in February at 7.3 percent.
