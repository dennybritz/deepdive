Police in Taiwan were forced to shoot a crocodile after it bit
off the arm of the zoo veterinarian treating it, an official said
Wednesday.


Dramatic television footage showed a police officer firing on the
animal to wrest the severed limb from its jaws.


Chang Po-yu, 38, from the southern Kaohsiung city's Shou Shan
Zoo, was injecting the sick crocodile with anaesthetic when it
attacked him.


He was said to be in a stable condition after being rushed to
hospital for an emergency operation to re-attach his arm, an
local official said, although it was not immediately clear
whether Chang would recover.
