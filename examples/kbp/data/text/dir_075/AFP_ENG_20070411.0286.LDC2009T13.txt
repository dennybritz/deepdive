The US military for the first time publicly accused Iranian
intelligence agents on Wednesday of supporting Sunni extremist
groups in Iraq and not just Shiite militiamen.


"We do have now some information that Iranian intelligence
agencies have supported some Sunni extremist groups," US military
spokesman Major General William Caldwell told reporters in
Baghdad.


He charged that Iranian intelligence agencies were continuing to
give training to armed Iraqi groups. "This training is provided
by surrogates of (Iranian) intelligence services," Caldwell said.


The US military also displayed a large cache of explosives, which
it said were newly made Iranian devices found in a black Mercedes
in Baghdad.


Tehran denies arming any Iraqi groups.


Washington has regularly accused arch foe Iran of training and
funding Shiite militias in the sectarian Sunni-Shiite conflict in
Iraq that has killed tens of thousands of people since the US-led
invasion four years ago.
