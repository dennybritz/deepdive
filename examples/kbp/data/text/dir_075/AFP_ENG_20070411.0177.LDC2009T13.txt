Japan's defence minister on Wednesday criticised China's rapidly
growing military spending just as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
started a landmark visit to Tokyo.


"I feel very uneasy about it," Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma said
of China's military expenditure.


"It is necessary to call for more transparency through dialogue,"
Kyuma said in a speech in Tokyo, as quoted by Jiji Press.


He said officially pacifist Japan may have to consider ways to
counter the growing spending.


"If there are emergency circumstances, we would simply have to do
what we can to take substantial countermeasures based on the
government's basic defense programme," Kyuma said.


While such remarks are common for Japanese and US officials, they
came just as China's Premier Wen Jiabao started a visit to Tokyo
meant to improve relations.


Wen is the first Chinese leader to visit Japan in seven years.


China has said it will boost military spending by 17.8 percent
this year and in January became only the third nation to shoot
down an object in space.


Kyuma is known for his outspoken remarks. In January, he caused a
stir when he said the United States was wrong to invade Iraq,
even though Japan had supported the decision at the time.
