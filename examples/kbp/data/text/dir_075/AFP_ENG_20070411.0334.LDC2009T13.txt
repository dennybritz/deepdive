China's state-owned enterprises continue to waste more money than
their private- sector counterparts when they invest, the
International Monetary Fund said Wednesday.


The result is a loss for all of Chinese society, as greater
efficiency would mean less money would have to be spent on
investment, and more on consumption, the IMF said in its World
Economic Outlook.


"Wholly and majority state-owned firms are found to have lower
marginal returns to capital than private or foreign firms," it
said.


"With a more efficient use of capital, the country could reduce
its very high investment rate substantially with no adverse
effect on its growth rate."


It argued an improvement in investment efficiency could lead to a
faster rise in household consumption and living standards.


It said that state-owned enterprises account for just one third
of overall economic output, but get more than half the loans
extended by domestic banks, while majority state-owned firms
account for most publicly traded stock.


"Besides curbing the amount of investment in the less efficient
(state companies), efficiency could be raised through further
reforms of the incentives for the managers," it said.


Such reforms would help them "behave in a manner similar to their
counterparts in profit-maximizing private firms. Moreover,
financial sector reforms can also foster an improved allocation
of capital," it said.
