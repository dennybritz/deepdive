A Danish court on Wednesday rejected an attempt by 26 Danes to
sue Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen for involving Denmark in
the war in Iraq, news agency Ritzau reported.


The plaintiffs, including ordinary Danes but also the parents of
a Danish soldier killed in Iraq, had accused the prime minister
of violating the constitution by engaging Denmark in the war in
2003.


The group wanted to prosecute Rasmussen "as a representative of
the state, for the illegal decision taken by the government and
parliament on March 21, 2003, to enter into a war of aggression
against Iraq", it said.


The group called itself "Committee for the Constitution 2003", a
reference to the year when Denmark joined the war in Iraq.


Most of the plaintiffs were not directly involved in the war and
had no family members stationed in Iraq, which weakened their
case, experts said prior to Wednesday's ruling.


The plaintiffs claimed among other things that Denmark's
involvement violated article 19 of its constitution, which only
authorizes war in defense against offensive nations or as part of
an intervention backed by the United Nations.


The plaintiffs have previously indicated that they might appeal
to the Supreme Court if the lower court rejected their request.


Denmark has 460 soldiers stationed in Iraq, including 415 in
Basra in the south of the country under British command. Six
Danish soldiers have been killed in Iraq since 2003.


Rasmussen announced in February that the troops would be
withdrawn in August this year. They are to be replaced by four
helicopters and 50 men.
