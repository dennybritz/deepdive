A suicide attacker blew himself up near a NATO-led military
convoy in Afghanistan's main southern city of Kandahar on
Wednesday, injuring eight Afghan civilians, police said.


The blast in Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban regime,
comes after a pledge by the hardline movement to launch a wave of
suicide bombings amid a bloody insurgency that has killed nearly
1,000 people this year.


"There was a suicide bombing against a NATO convoy in Kandahar
city," provincial police chief Esmatullah Alizai told AFP.


He did not have immediate information on casualties but a police
official at the scene of the explosion said eight Afghan
civilians were wounded, with no military casualties.


The NATO headquarters in Kabul confirmed an "explosion" and said
its troops did not suffer any casualties.


Kandahar is one of the most violent regions in insurgency-hit
southern Afghanistan. Thousands of foreign troops, mainly from
the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, are based
there.


Six Canadian NATO soldiers were killed and two injured Sunday by
a roadside bomb west of Kandahar, in the deadliest single attack
on NATO in the country this year
