The World Trade Organisation will hold its first meeting on
Iraq's accession process next week, some two and a half years
after the country first launched its membership bid, trade
sources said on Wednesday.


Iraq applied to join the global trade club in October 2004. Its
oil-dependent economy has been ravaged by decades of sanctions
followed by spiralling violence and unemployment since the US-led
invasion in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein.


The WTO working party will meet on Friday, April 20 in Geneva to
begin its examination of Iraq's foreign trade regime and consider
its next steps, trade sources said.


The United Nations last month hosted a conference on Iraqi
economic reconstruction, and called on Baghdad to ensure its oil
wealth is equitably distributed amongst all ethnic groups.
