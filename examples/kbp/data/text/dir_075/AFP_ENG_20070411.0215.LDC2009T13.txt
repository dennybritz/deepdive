Two bomb explosions rocked the Algerian  capital in quick
succession on Wednesday, including one which left dozens of
people injured outside the government headquarters, witnesses
said.


They said a car bomb exploded at the entrance to the seat of
government, shaking several buildings and sending shattered glass
flying over a distance of 200 to 300 meters (yards).


Ambulances and police cars immediately rushed to the multi-storey
building, which also houses several ministries.


An AFP journalist at the scene said dozens of people were
injured, but it was not clear if there were any fatalities.


A thick cloud of smoke rose from the site of the blast, which was
heard across the city.


Thousands of passersby congregated on the vast steps of the
building, as uniformed and plainclothes police attempted to
contain the crowd.


Minutes later, another bomb attack targeted a police station in
an eastern suburb of Algiers, near the international airport,
witnesses said.


It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties and
there was no immediate claim of responsibility.


The Algerian army recently conducted an offensive in the eastern
region of Kabylie against an Islamist militant group that has
claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks in Algeria
and is also active in other countries, notably Tunisia


At least 20 Islamists and three soldiers were killed in the
operation to flush out members of the Al-Qaeda-linked Salafist
Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC).
