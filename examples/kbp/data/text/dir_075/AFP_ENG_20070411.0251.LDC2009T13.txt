Bangladesh's main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed has been
charged with the murder of four people during political violence
which racked the nation's capital last October, police said
Wednesday.


Hasina, who is on holiday in the United States, "has been charged
with the murder of four people during the political unrest last
October," police deputy commissioner Shahidul Haq Bhuiyan told
AFP.


"Detective branch police submitted the charge-sheet of the case
to a Dhaka court today after carrying out investigations and
taking evidence," said Bhuiyan.
