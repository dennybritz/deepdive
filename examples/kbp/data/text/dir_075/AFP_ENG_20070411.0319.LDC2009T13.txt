The world economy is poised to expand by 4.9 percent this year,
down from last year but still a "robust" rate in the face of a
housing-led slowdown in the United States, the IMF said
Wednesday.


In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the International
Monetary Fund said global growth would moderate from last year's
figure of 5.4 percent, and again reach 4.9 percent in 2008.


"Notwithstanding the recent bout of financial volatility, the
world economy still looks well set for continued robust growth in
2007 and 2008," the twice- yearly report said.
