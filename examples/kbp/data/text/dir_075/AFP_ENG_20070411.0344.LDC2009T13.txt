Pippa, a 17-year-old Cockatoo, has spent two weeks trying to
hatch a bowl of chocolate Easter eggs intended for visitors to an
English wildlife centre, the owner said Wednesday.


"It's very comical. She's not usually maternal so it's come as a
bit of a surprise," said Geoff Grewcock, of the Nuneaton and
Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary in central England.


"We had a lot of creme eggs so we put them in a dish on a table
for people to take. When we got Pippa out, she went straight to
them and began nesting on them," he said.


"She's so protective over them and if anyone goes near them
she'll attack," Grewcock added.


"They're going to melt if we don't take them away. We're taking
them away gradually so she should be OK. I think she thinks they
should be hatching now and has starting pecking at them. It's
very strange."
