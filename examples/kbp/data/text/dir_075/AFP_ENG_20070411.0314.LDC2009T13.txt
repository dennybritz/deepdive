The release of Zimbabwe's latest inflation figures has been
postponed from Wednesay until the end of the week, the Central
Statistical Office said.


"There are a few technical hitches that we are finalising and we
should be ready by Friday," CSO director Moffat Nyoni told AFP.


The figures were meant to have been released on Wednesday
afternoon.


Analysts predict that the rate of inflation, already the highest
in the world at 1,730 percent, may pass the 2,000 percent mark
when the figure is released.
