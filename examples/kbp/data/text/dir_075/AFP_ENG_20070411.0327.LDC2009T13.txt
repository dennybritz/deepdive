East Timor's President Xanana Gusmao said Wednesday the troubled
nation will hold parliamentary elections on June 30, after his
successor is selected in a runoff vote.


Gusmao chose not to stand for re-election in the impoverished
nation's April 9 presidential poll, which will be decided in a
runoff on May 8 after candidates failed to win a majority.


The charismatic former guerrilla leader has said he will run for
the much more powerful job of prime minister. The presidency is a
largely ceremonial office in East Timor.


Gusmao intends to join a new party, the National Congress of
Reconstruction of Timor, to contest the June poll.


He faces a formidable obstacle in East Timor's ruling Fretilin
party, whose presidential candidate Francisco "Lu-Olo" Guterres
is through to the May runoff and will most likely face Jose
Ramos-Horta, the current premier.


The presidential election is being seen as a trial run for the
June 30 poll.
