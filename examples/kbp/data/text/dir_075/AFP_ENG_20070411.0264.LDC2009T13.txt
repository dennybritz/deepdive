Japan and China agreed Wednesday to "look frankly" at history and
support a "constructive" world role for each power, in a joint
statement issued after a rare summit here.


Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
agreed "to look at history frankly and jointly build a beautiful
future for the bilateral relationship," the joint statement said.


China has accused Japan of not atoning for its past aggression,
and cited the issue to scuttle Tokyo's cherished bid for a
permanent seat on the UN Security Council.


"China said Japan should play a more constructive role in the
international community," the statement said, without explicitly
backing the UN bid.


The Asian powers should "contribute constructively to the world's
peace, stability and development" and "assume the
responsibilities given to both countries in the new era," it
said.


It was the first joint declaration issued in Tokyo from a Japan-
China summit since 1998, when China's then president Jiang Zemin
visited.


In the latest statement, the two countries also agreed to
cooperate on protecting the environment and conserving energy.


It also pledged cooperation, but did not show any concrete
breakthroughs in a longstanding row over gas deposits in the East
China Sea.


Both sides "agreed to make it a sea of peace, friendship and
cooperation," the statement said.


Japan also reiterated its commitment to recognise only Beijing
and not Taiwan as the legitimate government of China.
