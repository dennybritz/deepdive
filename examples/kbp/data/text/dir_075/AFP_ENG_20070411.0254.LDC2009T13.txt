Lyon's Brazilian central defender Claudio Cacapa said on
Wednesday he would be leaving the five-time defending French
league champions.


The 31-year-old Cacapa, who has been at the club more than six
years, is out of contract at the end of the season. He arrived in
January 2001 from Brazilian first division club Atletico Minero.
