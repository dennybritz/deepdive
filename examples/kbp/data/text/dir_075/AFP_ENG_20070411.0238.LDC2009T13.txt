Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has advised African military
officers to contest elections to get to power rather than stage
coups, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Wednesday.


"If you have worn the military uniform and desire to participate
in politics, you can drop the uniform and contest for the
office," Obasanjo told visiting defence chiefs from west Africa
in Abuja on Tuesday.


He said Africa would no longer accept people with "gun in hand
and in uniform, shooting themselves into office".


"Gone for ever are the days when someone in uniform hopes to use
it as a stepping stone to political office," he added.


Obasanjo, himself a retired general and former military leader,
became a civilian president in May 1999 and is due to step down
next month at the end of his constitutional limit of two terms in
office.


Nigerians will go to the polls on Saturday to elect governors and
legislators for the 36 states while presidential elections will
take place on April 21.
