The IMF Wednesday slashed its projection for US economic growth
this year to just 2.2 percent but said the world's largest
economy would stave off recession.


The International Monetary Fund said in its semiannual World
Economic Outlook report that the US economy will expand at a
tepid pace in 2007 as downturns in housing and manufacturing
remain drags on growth.


The report lowered by 0.7 percentage points the outlook for 2007
gross domestic product (GDP) compared with the IMF report in
September, and added that the "balance of risks to this less
buoyant outlook remains on the downside."
