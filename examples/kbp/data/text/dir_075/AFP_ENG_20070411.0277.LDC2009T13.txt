Sixteen football fans -- 12 English and four Italian -- were
charged Wednesday after clashes with police marred Manchester
United's Champions League quarter- final victory over AS Roma,
police said.


They were charged after violence flared briefly between up to 100
rival fans outside the Old Trafford stadium in Manchester before
Tuesday evening's game.


Police with dogs and batons had arrested a total of 21 people.


The group face a range of different charges including possession
of a bladed weapon, criminal damage and public order offences, a
spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police told AFP.


The four Italians appeared at Manchester City Magistrates Court
for a preliminary hearing Wednesday morning, while the English
fans will appear at Trafford Magistrates Court in Manchester
later.


United's dazzling 7-1 second leg victory swept them through to
the Champions League semi-finals.


At last week's clash in Rome, which Roma won 2-1, several United
fans needed hospital treatment after being stabbed before the
match, while Italian police baton-charged the visiting supporters
during the first half.
