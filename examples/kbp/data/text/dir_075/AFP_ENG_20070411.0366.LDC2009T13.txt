A Norwegian prosecutor Wednesday sought sentences of seven to 12
years for three men convicted over the 2004 theft of
expressionist masterpiece "The Scream".


The prosecution was also reportedly seeking damages of 2.8
million kroner (346,000 euros, 465,000 dollars) following the
conclusion of the appeals case last month.


The heaviest sentence of 12 years was sought for Bjoern Hoen, the
mastermind of the armed robbery carried out in broad daylight on
August 22, 2004 by two hooded thieves at Oslo's Munch Museum.


According to Norwegian news agency NTB, sentences of seven and 10
years were sought for Stian Skjold, who snatched the painting,
and Petter Tharaldsen, the gang's driver.


The Oslo appeals court has already convicted the three but has
yet to sentence them.


Police said another gang member died of a heroin overdose on
November 3 before he could be charged.


"The Scream" and another painting by Edvard Munch that was also
stolen, "Madonna", were recovered in August last year.


The circumstances of their recovery and whereabouts while stolen
remain a mystery. The paintings are being restored.
