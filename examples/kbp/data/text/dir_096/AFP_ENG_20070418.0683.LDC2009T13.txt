A surge in armed robberies in Sierra Leone has forced petrol
stations and fuel outlets in the capital to close early to avoid
a spiralling wave of nighttime attacks, officials said Wednesday.


"We shall sell to the public from 6.30 am and stop all sales at 6
pm each day," Abubakar Sillah, who manages a French-owned Total
petrol station, told AFP.


Millions of dollars in money and fuel has been stolen during the
surge in robberies in recent weeks.


In the latest attack gunmen got away with nearly three million
dollars worth of goods on Monday night, said Ishmeal Jalloh, a
sales manager with local dealer Safecon.


"They took away petroleum products in containers which were
displayed for sale as well," he said.


In a notice posted on its website, the US Department of State
consular affairs section warns its citizens in Sierra Leone to be
cautious because "the poor state of Sierra Leone's economy and
lack of opportunity for most Sierra Leoneans have increased the
crime rate".


"There has been an increase in homicide, armed robbery and
residential burglary," it said.
