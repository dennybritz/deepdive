Three Saudis were behind the murders in February of a French
teenager and three other compatriots in the desert kingdom, the
interior ministry said Wednesday.


"The mastermind of this abominable crime" was Walid Motlaq al-
Raddadi, who was killed by police in Medina on April 6, the
official SPA news agency quoted the spokesman as saying.


Al-Raddadi, a 23-year-old Saudi who figured on a June 2005 list
of 36 most- wanted suspected Al-Qaeda militants, had two other
partners in crime: Majid bin Maidh bin Rashid al-Harbi and
Abdallah bin Sayer Al-Mohammadi.


The Frenchmen were in a group of nine travelling in the northwest
-- an area of the country popular with expatriates -- when they
got lost and asked al-Raddidi for directions.


Those killed included a teenager, two employees of an energy
company and a teacher at the French school in Riyadh.


The February attack was the first in three months against
Westerners in Saudi Arabia.


The oil-rich kingdom was rocked by a spate of bombings and
shootings blamed on suspected Al-Qaeda militants that started in
May 2003, triggering a relentless security crackdown on Islamist
extremists.


The interior ministry has since warned Western governments of the
danger of further attacks on foreigners, and the British and US
embassies joined the French in issuing warnings to their
nationals.
