Thailand has stepped up its use of militias in a bid to quell an
insurgency in the nation's Muslim-majority south, putting
civilians at greater risk of violence, a US-based rights group
said Thursday.


Human Rights Watch said Thailand's military-backed government,
which came to power after a September coup, has increasingly
relied on "abusive militias" for security in the troubled region
bordering Malaysia.


The government "has significantly stepped up its use of
paramilitary Army rangers and village defense volunteers to face
the growing challenge posed by separatist groups" in the south,
it said in a statement.


It said reliance on militias placed civilians at "increasing
risk" and voiced grave concern following last week's shooting of
five unarmed Muslim boys by security forces.


Three boys were shot dead, and the security forces insisted they
had acted in self-defence.


"Thai authorities have a duty to discipline and, where necessary,
prosecute Army rangers and any other irregular forces that commit
abuses," said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in the violence-torn
provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani since the separatist
insurgency erupted in January 2004.


The violence has escalated over the past six months in the
troubled region despite peace efforts by the military-installed
government that included an apology to Muslims for past abuses.
