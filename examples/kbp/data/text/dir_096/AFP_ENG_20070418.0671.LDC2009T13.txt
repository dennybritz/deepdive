The gunman who killed at least 30 students on a Virginia college
campus sent photographs, video and writings to NBC news, police
said Wednesday.


"Earlier today, NBC news in New York received correspondence that
we believe to have been from Cho Seung-Hui, the gunman
responsible for the fatal shootings in Norris Hall," police
superintendent Steve Flaherty told a news conference.


"The correspondence included multiple photographs, video and
writings. Upon receipt of this correspondence, NBC news
immediately notified authorities."
