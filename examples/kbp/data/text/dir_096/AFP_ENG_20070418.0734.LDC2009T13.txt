Three people, two of them police officers, were killed in
shootouts in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, including at a
hospital where several suspects remained holed up Wednesday,
officials said.


The violence started after police chased a group of alleged
gunmen traveling in a van that had failed to stop at a traffic
signal. The high-speed chase ended when the van crashed into a
tree. The ensuing gunfight left one of the alleged gunmen dead.


Wounded occupants of the van were taken to a hospital, where
another gunfight took place as a second group of armed men opened
fire, killing two policemen and leaving three civilians wounded,
said police chief Jaime Niebla.


"At this point we don't know if they came to rescue (the wounded
gunmen) or to kill someone," said Niebla, adding that two of the
armed suspects were detained.


Several gunmen remained in the hospital, which was partly
evacuated, authorities said.


The area around Tijuana is a key route for drug trafficking and
illegal migrant smuggling into the neighboring United States.


Wednesday's incident was the latest in a wave of violence that
has rocked Mexico and left several hundred people dead so far
this year amid a surge in infighting between rival drug gangs.
