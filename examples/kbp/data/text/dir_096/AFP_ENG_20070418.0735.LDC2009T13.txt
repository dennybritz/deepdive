The gunman in a US campus massacre said he was "forced into a
corner" and accused others of having "blood on their hands"
according to video released Wednesday that he made before the
shootings.


"You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided
today," Cho Seung- Hui said in one of 29 video files he sent to
NBC news in a package of writings, pictures and videos, and
mailed from Blacksburg where Virginia Tech university is located.


"But you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into a corner
and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have
blood on your hands that will never wash off."
