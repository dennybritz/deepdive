Two Taiwan lawmakers were under fire Thursday after staging a
hoax hostage- taking at a local university to test if campus
officials were prepared for events like the US school massacre.


Lee Chen-nan and Lin Kuo-ching of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) reported to the police on Wednesday that
three students at the National Taiwan University (NTU) had been
taken hostage.


Some 55 policemen were dispatched to the campus only to find the
lawmakers, accompanied by reporters, claiming to be holding a
"drill".


"I will resign and quit politics if I (organised the drill) not
out of concerns for the students," a tearful Lee told reporters.


But his explanation failed to ease the criticism and the DPP
caucus was forced to apologise to the public.


"We condemn the lawmakers ... for disrupting the campus and
forcing the school and the police into staging such a show.
Relevant authorities will investigate if they filed a false
report," the Taiwanese cabinet said.
