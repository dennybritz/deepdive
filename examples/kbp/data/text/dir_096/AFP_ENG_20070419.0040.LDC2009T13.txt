Indonesia's environment minister has proposed a ban on the sale
of new cars in a radical bid to slash pollution levels in the
nation's rapidly growing urban areas, a report said Thursday.


Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar said the plan could be
introduced if new national anti-pollution measures did not
improve air quality, the Jakarta Post said.


"If there is no progress in restoring air quality, we will stop
(new car sales)," Witoelar said. "It is a bitter pill to take,
but it is for the sake of public health."


He said Indonesia had already introduced new emission standards
based on international guidelines but "if we don't take further
action, the numbers of cars and motorcycles will exceed our
country's population."


The capital Jakarta and some other Indonesian cities have chronic
smog levels and traffic congestion is a major problem.


Private car ownership is increasing by about 11 percent a year,
data from Jakarta's local government shows.


New moves to combat pollution include publically grading cities
from the dirtiest to the cleanest, the minister told the
newspaper.


Witoelar acknowledged that the social impact of the ban on new
cars would be horrendous for thousands of Indonesians. But he
said pollution from vehicles was equally damaging, including
contributing to global warming.
