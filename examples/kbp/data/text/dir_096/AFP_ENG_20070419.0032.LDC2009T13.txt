Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz headed Thursday for the
southwest Chinese city where his country is involved in a joint
project to develop a fighter jet.


Aziz flew to Chengdu after meetings with Chinese leaders in
Beijing on terrorism and other issues including Afghanistan, Iran
and India, state-run Xinhua news agency said.


The prime minister, in China on a week-long visit, will use his
trip to Chengdu to attend the inaugural ceremony of Pakistan's
consulate general, according to Xinhua.


China, Pakistan's main military supplier, has set up a joint
project in Chengdu to develop the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft.
It was unclear from reports if Aziz planned to visit the
facility.


Aziz met Wednesday met with President Hu Jintao.


"To win hearts and minds, we should provide (potential
terrorists) with economic prosperity and a better future full of
hope," Xinhua news agency quoted Aziz as saying.


China says it is under threat from terrorists seeking to create a
separate state in its western-most Muslim-majority Xinjiang
region.


According to Thursday's edition of the People's Daily, Aziz
argued that "military methods alone cannot win the war against
terrorism."


"Without a plan for political participation and economic and
social development, the problem of terrorism will never be fully
resolved."


Aziz met earlier with his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao, and the
two oversaw the signing of 13 agreements on cooperation in areas
such as space, telecoms, education and legal assistance.
