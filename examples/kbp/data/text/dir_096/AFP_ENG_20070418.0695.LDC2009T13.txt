US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte arrived in
Mauritania Wednesday to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the
west African nation's first democratically elected president.


Negroponte will attend Thursday's investiture of President Sidi
Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, elected in the country's first democratic
polls held in March, the US embassy said.


"This will provide an occasion for Mr Negroponte to discuss the
traditionally excellent bilateral relations," a statement said.


Mauritania's autocratic ruler Maaouiya Ould Taya who ruled with
an iron fist for 20 years was ousted in a bloodless coup and
replaced by the Military Council for Justice and Democracy
(CMJD), a 17-member military junta.


Among foreign leaders billed to witness the swearing-in are the
presidents of Senegal, Mali, Niger, Togo, Cape Verde and Guinea-
Bissau.
