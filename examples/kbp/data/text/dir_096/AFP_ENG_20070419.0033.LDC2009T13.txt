Three Taliban rebels wearing fake police uniforms were killed in
a gunbattle with Afghan and US-led troops in western Afghanistan,
the US military said Thursday.


The fighting on Wednesday erupted after the troops received
small-arms fire from militants dressed in police outfits who had
set up a checkpost near the town of Shindand in western Herat
province, the military said.


"The combined patrol returned fire killing three enemy fighters
and wounding another three," it said in a statement.


"Over the last two weeks, there have been multiple reports of
Taliban fighters impersonating (police) officers and establishing
illegal check points to kidnap and terrorise local Afghan
civilians," the statement said.


It added that the combined forces had confiscated over 100 fake
Afghan police uniforms as well dozens of false police
identification cards in Herat, which borders Iran.


"Taliban fighters are attempting to discredit the Afghan National
Police force," the statement quoted coalition spokesman Major
Christopher Belcher as saying.


"With the support of the Afghan people, Afghan National Security
forces and coalition forces will put an end to this Taliban
tactic," the spokesman said.


The Taliban were toppled in 2001 but are still waging a
guerrilla-style insurgency targeting foreign and Afghan security
forces and anyone who appears to be working with them.
