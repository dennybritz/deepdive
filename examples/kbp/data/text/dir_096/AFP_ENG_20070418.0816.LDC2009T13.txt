Vietnam will issue international bonds worth about one billion
dollars this year to raise money for major infrastructure
projects, the government said Thursday.


Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said proceeds from the bonds with
a maturity of between 15 and 20 years, would be used for
construction of the Dung Quat oil refinery, a hydropower project,
and for the purchase of a cargo ship.


The issues will be made in three tranches, the first consists of
government issued bonds that will be used to lend to state
enterprises, he said according to the government's website.


The other two would be state enterprise issued bonds with or
without government guarantees.


The prime minister has asked the finance ministry to finalise the
bond issues for approval late this month, the website said.


Vietnam first issued 10-year international bonds worth 750
million dollars in 2005. Officials said the issue went beyond
expectations as they received heavy orders from foreign investors
in Asia, the US and Europe.
