A light aircraft crashed and exploded in a residential area of
the Philippine capital Manila on Thursday, killing at least one
person, witnesses and radio reports said.


It was not immediately clear how many people were aboard the
Cessna plane, which crashed into a vacant lot in the
neighbourhood of Merville village in southern Manila, officials
said.


Julius Porlas, whose house was several meters away from the crash
site, said he saw the plane nose-dive and it "exploded upon
hitting the ground."


"It was burning and at least one body was retrieved," Porlas told
a local radio station.


"I ran to the site but there was no chance for me to help because
it was engulfed by fire," he said.


Air Transportation Office chief Nilo Jatico said crash
investigators were sent to secure the crash site and find out who
owned or hired the aircraft.


He said there were no other details immediately available.
