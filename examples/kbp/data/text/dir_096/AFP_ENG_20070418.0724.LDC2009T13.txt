The South Korean gunman who killed at least 30 people at a
Virginia univerity this week sent pictures of himself brandishing
handguns along with his furious writings to a major US news
outlet before he committed suicide.


The NBC television network broadcast a still photo of the
shooter, facing a camera, wearing black fingerless gloves and
aiming two handguns slightly outward.


The 23-year-old English major Cho Seung-Hui is staring at the
camera with a fierce expression, wearing a backwards black
baseball cap and the same black and tan hunting gear described by
students who survived the shooting.


The image was included in a package mailed to NBC news on Monday,
the day of the worst school shooting in US history, along with
Cho's profanity-laced writings and video warnings in which he
vaguely referred to the massacre.
