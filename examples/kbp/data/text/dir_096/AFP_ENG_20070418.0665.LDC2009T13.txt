The United States sought to play down a refugee agreement
announced by Australia on Wednesday and which critics said would
allow the two close allies to essentially "swap" detained
boatpeople.


Australian officials said the arrangement would see mainly Asian
refugees intercepted on their way to Australia and held at a
remote Pacific island considered for resettlement in the US,
while Cuban and Haitian asylum-seekers hoping to live in the US
could be sent to Australia.


Australia's conservative prime minister, John Howard, who is
running for reelection later this year, said the scheme would
"drive home the point that this country will not compromise in
relation to illegal immigration.'


But the State Department minimized the import of the accord.


"It is an informal arrangement for mutual assistance that
provides that each will consider resettlement of people
interdicted at sea and found to be in need of international
protection," department spokesman Sean McCormack said.


He said the arrangement created "no legal obligations" and would
concern at most 200 people per year.


"The United States and Australia will each consider individuals
for resettlement in accordance with our own regulations and
procedures, respectively," he said.


"No referrals have been accepted by either country at this time,"
he told reporters.


McCormack also stressed that the deal "does not call for an
exchange or a swap of individuals, and no person who is referred
would be forced to accept resettlement."
