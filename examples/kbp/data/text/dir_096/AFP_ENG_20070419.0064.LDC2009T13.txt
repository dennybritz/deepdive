German producer prices, the price of goods at the factory gate,
rose by 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in March, the slowest
rate in two and a half years, the federal statistics office
Destatis said on Thursday.


In February, the German producer price index (PPI) had risen by
2.8 percent year-on-year.


The March rate of producer price inflation rate was the lowest
since September 2004, Destatis said in a statement.


The main factor behind the slowdown was a statistical base
effect, but also lower energy prices, the statisticians
calculated.


Excluding energy prices, German producer prices rose by 3.0
percent year-on-year last month, Destatis calculated.
