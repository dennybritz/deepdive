San Antonio Spurs center Fabricio Oberto of Argentina had a
successful procedure to return his heart to a normal rhythm, the
National Basketball Association team said Wednesday.


Oberto was in stable condition and was able to return home after
the procedure. The Spurs expected him to be available for game
one of the team's first-round playoff series against Denver this
weekend.


"He had a procedure (Wednesday) and went home. We're going to
check his heart rate and rhythm for the next couple of days," San
Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. "If everything stays under
control, it looks good that he might be able to practice on
Saturday."


After seeing a cardiologist, Oberto was determined to have heart
arrhythmia caused by taking a hit to the chest in Sunday's loss
to the the rival Dallas Mavericks.


"He got hit in the neck during the Dallas game and thought he was
fine, then he said he felt racy," Popovich said. "He said he felt
racy and his whole body sped up. We're just very lucky he said
something."


In his second campaign, the Argentinian center is averaging 4.4
points and 4.7 rebounds in 79 games.
