The past caught up Wednesday with the Czech police when 15 senior
officers were found to have had links with the former Communist
secret police, the StB, the interior ministry said.


"The police checks have been completed, 15 failed to get the
proper clearance," spokesman Petr Vorlicek told AFP.


The probe of 874 top officers was demanded by Interior Minister
Ivan Langer following the revelation in February that the head of
Interpol's Czech office, Pavol Mihal, had been a former communist
police agent.


Mihal, who left his post without comment after being sacked for
being a former agent of the secret police's information service,
had simply modified his first name to Pavel to evade security
checks.


A parallel probe into the pasts of around 250 top interior
ministry staff is still continuing, Vorlicek added.


A Czech law dating from 1991 bans former communist secret police
agents from top public positions in the police, state
administration, legal system, army, state- owned media and state-
controlled companies.


Vorlicek said it was not yet clear if all of the 15 top police
employees would have to quit their current posts. "I can not say
whether clearance was required for all these positions," he told
AFP.
