Britain's international development minister backed a project
aimed at reducing drugs prices by improving transparency and
making information widely available, in an interview published
Thursday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, Hilary Benn said that Britain
wanted to improve "information on the price of drugs, their
availability and quality."


"We know that there are big mark-ups on drugs, drugs are not
always available, distribution is not working and the quality is
often not effective."


Benn lent his support to the Medicines Transparency Alliance
(META), a project partly funded by his Department for
International Development, which aims to both improve access and
lower prices to life-saving drugs by sharing information between
governments, non-governmental organisations and businesses.


By doing so, it is aiming to improve efficiency and reduce
corruption.


Pilots of META are due to be launched in nine countries, among
them Ghana, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Peru and the Philippines, this
summer, with a global roll- out towards the end of the year, the
FT said.
