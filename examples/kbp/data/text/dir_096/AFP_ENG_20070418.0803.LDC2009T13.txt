Rinko Kikuchi, who won an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a
sexually precocious schoolgirl in "Babel," insists that Japanese
actresses don't have to look weak.


The 26-year-old, who was virtually unknown a year ago, said she
grew up wondering why Japanese actresses rarely made it big
overseas.


"But then, I've been told it's because Japanese actresses look
weak and diluted on celluloid -- they're often uncomfortable
about coming on strong," Kikuchi told the Japan Times.


"I guess that's true," she said. "After all, it's part of our
culture to value excessive modesty, right? But I'm more
motivated."


"Babel," which received seven Oscar nominations, also stars Brad
Pitt and Cate Blanchett in a multilingual drama interweaving
three storylines unfolding around the globe.


Kikuchi mastered sign language and bared all her body to play the
role of Chieko, a deaf schoolgirl who is struggling to find an
outlet for her sexual desire and cope with her mother's suicide.


"I felt that if anyone could do this it was going to be me,"
Kikuchi told the paper. "There's just no other way to describe
it. It had to be me."


"Babel," which was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, is
being heavily promoted in Japan ahead of its release here next
week.
