Tanzania has begun a review of its position on the death penalty
and is considering outlawing the practice, Justice Minister Mary
Nagu said Wednesday.


"The government through the Law Reform Commission has already
initiated the process of reviewing the law relating to death
penalty. The exercise will also involve collection of the
people's views on the death penalty," Nagu told reporters.


She said Dar es Salaam was under pressure from human rights
outfits to abolish the practice which dates back the colonial
period.


Under Tanzanian laws, murder and high treason are the only
offences punishable by a death sentence.


In Nairobi, the state-run Kenya National Commission on Human
Rights (KNCHR) pressed the Tanzanian government to reform its
statutes and abolish the practice.


"The death penalty constitutes a violation of the most
fundamental right, the right to life," the panel said in a
statement.


"The parliament of Kenya should take immediate and necessary
steps to abolish the death penalty. The government should, in the
meantime, commute all sentences of death row convicts to life
imprisonment," it added.


In Kenya, all capital offences -- notably murder, attempted
murder, robbery with violence and treason are punishable by
death. But the country has never hanged anybody since 1987.
