Marseille set up a clash with Sochaux in next month's French Cup
final with a 3-0 win over Nantes in their semi-final tie here on
Wednesday.


French international Franck Ribery set the hosts on their way to
their second consecutive Cup final after 28 minutes only to limp
off the pitch at half time with a thigh problem.


Toifilou Maoulida doubled their account on 55 minutes with
striker Djibril Cisse coming on as a late substitute and finding
the net 14 minutes from time.


Marseille will be looking for their first title since 1993 on May
12 in Stade de France, and their 11th crown in a competition
where they hold the record.


It will be their 18th appearance in the final. Last year they
lost 2-1 to Paris Saint Germain.


Sochaux, competing in their fifth Cup final, will be bidding to
win their first title in the event since 1937.


They booked their spot on Tuesday when two extra-time goals from
Sochaux's Sebastien Grax and Jerome Leroy ended the dream run of
fourth division Montceau.
