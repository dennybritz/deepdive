A package sent by South Korean campus gunman Cho Seung-Hui to US
network NBC was mailed from Blacksburg and postmarked at 9:01 am
on Monday the day of the killings, an NBC source told AFP
Wednesday.


The mailing was described as "a standard package," that arrived
via mail from Blacksburg, Virginia, where the university is
located, at the NBC offices in New York, the source said.


"Initially they didn't know what to do with it," the source said.
"Someone opened it. There was a letter inside and a video. They
looked at the mailing stamp and time was 9:01 am."


The postmark time falls between two separate shooting incidents
that morning on the campus -- a first in which two students were
killed and a second in which 30 people were gunned down before
Cho committed suicide.
