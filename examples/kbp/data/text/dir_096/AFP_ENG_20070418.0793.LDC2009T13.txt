Mark Buehrle pitched the 16th no-hitter in Chicago White Sox
history on Wednesday, as the White Sox defeated the Texas Rangers
6-0.


The no-hitter was the first at US Cellular Field and first for
the White Sox since lefthander Wilson Alvarez accomplished the
feat against the Baltimore Orioles on August 11, 1991.


In the ninth inning, Buehrle struck out Matt Kata and Nelson Cruz
before getting Gerald Laird on a groundout to third base, setting
off a jubilant celebration in the middle of the diamond.


The only Texas baserunner was Sammy Sosa, who drew a walk in the
fifth inning, but Buehrle promptly picked him off.


Buehrle became the first major league no-hitter since Florida's
Anibal Sanchez beat Arizona 2-0 on September 6, 2006.


The last American League no-hitter was by Boston's Derek Lowe on
April 27, 2002, against Tampa Bay.
