A salvo of overnight mortar attacks killed a teenage Iraqi girl
and two young men in a mainly Shiite district of southern
Baghdad, a medical source said Thursday.


A series of mortar rounds smashed into the Zafaraniyah district,
killing the two men and an 18-year-old girl. A six-year-old boy
was wounded in the attack, the medical official said.


Just hours earlier, multiple car bombings killed 190 people in
other Shiite districts across the capital, dealing a hefty blow
to the credibility of a two- month-old US plan to return security
to Baghdad.
