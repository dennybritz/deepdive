South Korea's LG Electronics announced Thursday it swung to a
loss during the first quarter to March amid sluggish display
sales.


The country's second largest electronics company posted a net
loss of 122.6 billion won (132 million dollars) during the period
compared with a profit of 150.8 billion won in the first quarter
of 2006.


Sales rose four percent year-on-year to 6.03 trillion won but
operating profit dropped 9.3 percent year-on-year to 172.9
billion won, the firm said.


The company attributed the quarterly loss to seasonally weak
demand for flat display panels for TVs or computer monitors amid
continuing price falls for large display products.


On the stock market LG Electronics fell 1.86 percent to close at
63,300 won.
