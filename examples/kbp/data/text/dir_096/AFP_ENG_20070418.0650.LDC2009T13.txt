Students were evacuated from the University of Minnesota
Wednesday following a bomb threat, the US university said on its
website.


The threat came amid heightened tensions following the deadliest
school shooting in US history Monday which left 33 people dead at
Virginia Tech University.


It was one of scores of threats lobbed at schools and
universities across the country in the days following the
Virginia massacre.


Seven buildings were evacuated at the University of Minnesota's
East Bank campus Wednesday and students were asked to return to
their residence halls or off- campus housing.


"Please do not congregate in the Mall area," the university said
in a message posted on its home page.


Classes in those buildings were cancelled for the day, the
university said. Campus officials were not immediately available
for comment.
