The Seattle Mariners's loss to Minnesota on Wednesday paled in
comparison to the possible loss of young ace Felix Hernandez.


Hernandez left the major league baseball contest in the top of
the first inning with tightness in his right elbow after retiring
just one batter, and the Mariners went on to drop a 5-4 decision
to the Twins.


Hernandez allowed three runs on two hits and two walks before the
trainers came out of the dugout and lifted him with a 3-1 count
on Justin Morneau.


He was to be re-examined on Thursday.


The 21-year-old righthander pitched a one-hitter April 11 at
Boston and had allowed just four hits in 17 scoreless innings
entering Wednesday's game.


"It was very unfortunate to see Felix go out," Twins manager Ron
Gardenhire said. "We kind of had the same thing with our guy
(Francisco Liriano) last year, and it's no fun to watch them
leave the game."
