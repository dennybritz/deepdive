India's Essar group has announced it will acquire US-based
Minnesota Steel for an undisclosed amount in its second takeover
of a North American firm this week.


Minnesota Steel plans to set up a steel plant with an annual
capactiy of 2.5 million tonnes when completed at an estimated
cost of 1.65 billion dollars, the companies said in a joint
statement Wednesday.


Construction is expected to begin in the third quarter.


"Our investment in Minnesota Steel is exciting as it gives us a
cornerstone in the North American market. From this we will
further expand our global steel business," Essar Global Chairman
Shashi Ruia said.


Essar said on Monday that it would buy Canadian steelmaker Algoma
for 1.58 billion dollars to tap business opportunities in North
America.


Essar Global has interests in steel, oil, communications,
shipping and construction.


Minnesota Steel controls iron ore resources of over 1.4 billion
tonnes.


Earlier this year India's Tata Steel bought Anglo-Dutch firm
Corus for 13.7 billion dollars, a move that will make make it the
world's fifth-largest steelmaker.
