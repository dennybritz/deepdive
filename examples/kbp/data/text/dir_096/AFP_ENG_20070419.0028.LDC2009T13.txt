Chinese locksmith apprentices could be trained under the watchful
eye of police and "fingerprinted" in a plan to stop them using
their skills criminally, state media said Thursday.


The move comes after a series of burglaries where locksmiths
either passed their expertise on to criminals or committed
illegal acts themselves, the Xinhua news agency reported.


China plans to set up a national database containing the
professional fingerprint of each member of the trade, to indicate
who work was done by, Xinhua said, citing a recent circular from
government agencies.


"Regulation on locksmith training programs must be put into place
to prevent the skills from being disseminated in society," said
the document from the Ministry of Public Security and the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce.


According to the report police will closely investigate "the
unlawful activities arising from poor management of the locksmith
industry."


The government circular, which did not include a timeframe for
change, follows a case where a criminal in Shaanxi, northwest
China, confessed to stealing cash from a logistics company after
training as a locksmith.
