Hong Kong share prices finished the Thursday morning session 1.95
percent lower as investors locked in profits after falls on the
Japanese and China markets, dealers said.


They said China-related stocks led the fall on fears that the
mainland's A-share markets may be in for a big correction after
hitting new highs repeatedly in recent sessions.


They added that speculation regarding another interest rate hike
in China also weighed on sentiment.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning down 404.71 points at
20,372.38, off a low of 20,334.15 and a high of 20,634.90.
Turnover was 35.62 billion Hong Kong dollars (4.6 billion US).
