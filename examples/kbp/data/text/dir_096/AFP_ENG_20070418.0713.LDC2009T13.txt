Benni McCarthy claimed his 20th goal of the season with a diving
header as Blackburn pushed Watford to the brink of relegation
with a 3-1 win at Ewood Park on Wednesday.


Centreback Christopher Samba and McCarthy's strike partner Jason
Roberts were also on the mark as Rovers cruised to a comfortable
win which means that Watford's drop back to the Championship
could be confirmed as early as this weekend.


Blackburn needed just under six minutes to take the lead, Samba
heading in a David Bentley corner at the back post.


Four minutes later, Roberts doubled the lead with a shot that
beat Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster with pure power.


The visitors managed to pull a goal back mid-way through the
opening period, Douglas Rinaldi getting his head to a cross from
Hameur Bouazza at the back post.


But any chance of a fightback was snuffed out when McCarthy threw
himself full length to get on the end of another Bentley cross in
the 32nd minute.


That was to prove the final significant moment of the match as
Blackburn comfortably held on to their lead against demoralised
opponents.
