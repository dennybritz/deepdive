Malaysia's badminton coach has warned he may axe All-England
doubles champions Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong from the
Indonesian Open because success has gone to their heads.


Rexy Mainaky said he may exclude the duo from the Indonesian
tournament in mid- May as well as other punishments, such as
taking away their mobile phones, after a dismal performance in
the Asian Badminton Championships.


The pair lost in the final last week after struggling through a
semi-final match.


Rexy singled out Koo for his prima donna behaviour after the
pair's "worst performance" of the tournament.


"If I don't take any action, it means I condone his actions and
Kien Keat may repeat this," the New Straits Times quoted him as
saying.


"I cannot accept my players being arrogant and Kien Keat must
realise that he has a massive responsibility on his shoulders,"
he said.


"This is the pair we are grooming to win the World Championships
and the Olympic gold in Beijing" in 2008.


Rexy said he feared Koo and Tan had become big-headed after their
wins in the All-England Open, as well as the Asian Games, the
Malaysian Open and the Swiss Open.


"People are looking up to them because of their successes on the
international arena and the attention and praises are getting to
them," Rexy said in the Star daily.


"If I have to impose any restrictions, it is for their own good,"
he added.
