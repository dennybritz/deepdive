Croatian police said Wednesday they pressed charges against a
former communist- era spy over atrocities committed during and
after World War II.


Petar Zinajic, a former member of then Yugoslavia's security
agency OZNA, was suspected of having ordered the killings of 139
people in the region of the central Croatian town of Slunj.


"The victims were members of the (pro-Nazi) Ustasha regime and
their families, brothers, sisters, wives," police spokeswoman
Tanja Petric told AFP.


Zinajic was now 89 years old and believed to be living in
neighbouring Serbia, she said.


He was suspected of ordering the "Partizan" communist forces to
start a fire in front of a cave, leading to the deaths of 15
civilians who had been herded inside in February 1945.


The other victims listed in his war crimes indictment were
executed shortly after the war ended.


Police said evidence against Zinajic included descriptions of the
executions in letters that he had sent to then Communist Party
superiors.


Communist forces killed many accused of being collaborators of
the Ustasha after the fall of the fascist regime that was backed
by Nazi Germany.
