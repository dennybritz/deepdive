A light aircraft crashed and exploded in a residential area of
the Philippine capital Manila on Thursday, killing its  pilot,
officials said.


The Cessna had just taken off at Manila airport for Palawan
island when it apparently developed engine trouble, officials
said.


Officials said the pilot radioed that he was turning back, but
minutes later the aircraft plummeted into a vacant lot in the
neighbourhood of Merville village in southern Manila. There were
no other people aboard.


Julius Porlas, whose house was several meters away from the crash
site, said he saw the plane nose-dive and that it "exploded upon
hitting the ground."


"I ran to the site but there was no chance for me to help because
it was engulfed by fire," he told a local radio station.
