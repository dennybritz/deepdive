Japanese share prices slumped 1.44 percent in morning trade on
Thursday as investors rushed to sell exporter stocks after the
dollar fell back against the yen, dealers said.


They said the losses in Tokyo came despite fresh gains overnight
on Wall Street where upbeat earnings news helped power the Dow
Jones index to a record closing high Wednesday.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
dropped 254.92 points to 17,412.41 by the lunch break.


The broader Nikkei-225 index of all first-section shares shed
23.01 points or 1.33 percent to 1,707.70.
