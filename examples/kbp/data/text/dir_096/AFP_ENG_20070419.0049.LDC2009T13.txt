Strong rain and a whirlwind have killed one man and damaged
hundreds of houses in Vietnam, an official said Thursday.


Parts of northern Vietnam were hit by strong winds and heavy
rains on Tuesday and Wednesday, causing 500 million dong (31,000
dollars) in damage, said the local official.


"At least 19 houses were totally destroyed while 360 other homes
lost their roofs," he said.


Last weekend, 21 people were injured when a tornado struck
central Quang Nam province. The state-run Vietnam News Agency
said loss in crops and infrastructure damage reached 400,000
dollars.
