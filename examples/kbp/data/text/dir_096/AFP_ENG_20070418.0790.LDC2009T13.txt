Hong Kong share prices opened 0.78 percent lower Thursday as
investors turned cautious and locked in profits after falls on
the Japanese and China markets, dealers said.


They said a record high on Wall Street overnight was ignored on
increasing worries that the mainland's stock markets may be in
for a big correction after hitting new highs repeatedly in recent
sessions.


Such concerns were reinforced by news that key Chinese first
quarter growth figures due out Thursday have been put back to
after the close of the local stock markets.


The Hang Seng Index opened down 161.67 points at 20,615.42.
