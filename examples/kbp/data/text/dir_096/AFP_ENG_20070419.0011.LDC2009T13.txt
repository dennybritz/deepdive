Chinese share prices lost 2.39 percent in Thursday morning trade
as concerns about possible further tightening measures by the
government to slow the runaway economy prompted profit-taking
after recent record gains, dealers said.


They said investors were cashing out ahead of first-quarter
economic growth figures due later in the day that are expected to
show a blistering pace of growth.


"The market was weighed down by profit-taking as well as worries
that the macro- economic data ... might cause the government to
issue new credit control measures," said Wu Dazhong, an analyst
at Shenyin Wanguo Securities.


However, Wu said that that the market's momentum was currently
too strong too be undercut by unfavourable data or even renewed
government efforts to cool the economy.


"Even if the central bank decided to raise interest rates again
after the economic data, it will unlikely change the fact that
fresh money is still rushing into the market and that liquidity
is still abundant," Wu added.


"In the medium- and long-run, the market will continue its upward
trend on the back of strong corporate profit growth for this
year," Wu said.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, ended the morning down 86.39 points at 3,526.0.


The Shanghai A-share Index was down 90.76 points or 2.39 percent
at 3,705.93 and the Shenzhen A-share Index lost 30.56 points or
2.89 percent at 1,027.61.
