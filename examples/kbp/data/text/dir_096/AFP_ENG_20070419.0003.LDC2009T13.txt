A suspicious package which sparked a bomb scare and evacuation of
a New Zealand mail centre was later identified as a harmless sex
aid, a report said Thursday.


An airport x-ray machine alerted staff about suspicious wiring in
the parcel from China on Tuesday and it was placed in an
explosives safe overnight.


Emergency services were only notified the next morning when they
decided to evacuate the mail centre near Auckland airport.


The parcel was later identified as a sex aid, the New Zealand
Herald reported.


The incident has prompted a Customs investigation into why
emergency services were not immediately contacted, leaving a
potential bomb in a safe overnight.
