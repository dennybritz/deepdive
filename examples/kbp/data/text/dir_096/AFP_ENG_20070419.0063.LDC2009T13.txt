A takeover bid by Australia's Fairfax newspapers won overwhelming
approval from shareholders of rival Rural Press Thursday, paving
the way for a 9.0 billion (7.5 billion US) dollar media group.


Rural Press Ltd said 99.6 percent of its ordinary shareholders
voted in favor of a 2.8 billion dollar share and cash offer from
Australia's second largest newspaper publisher.


Preference shareholders had already approved the deal, which now
goes to the Federal Court on Monday for final approval.


On Wednesday, Fairfax secured the support of the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission after agreeing to divest some
newspapers owned by Rural Press, a regional newspaper and
agricultural publications publisher.


Fairfax made its move immediately after a major shake-up of media
ownership laws came into effect earlier this month, with the
merger making the company better able to withstand unwelcome
takeover bids.


Fairfax chairman Ron Walker said it was an historic day for both
companies.


"There's a lot of areas where we can improve Fairfax Media,
learning from the successes of Rural Press, so we are looking
forward to the coming together of these two organisations," he
said.


Australia's media landscape was transformed on April 4 when the
new laws took effect, easing restrictions on how many television,
radio and print holdings any one group can control in a single
city or region.
