Japanese share prices closed down 1.67 percent on Thursday, hit
by worries about a stronger yen and heavy losses on China's stock
markets, dealers said.


They said that the falls came despite fresh gains overnight on
Wall Street where the Dow Jones index hit a record closing high
on upbeat corporate news.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
dropped 295.36 points to 17,371.97. The broader Nikkei-225 index
of all first-section shares lost 23.78 points or 1.37 percent to
1,706.93.
