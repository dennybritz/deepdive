Rwanda has filed a complaint with the UN's highest court over a
French judge issuing arrest warrants against close associates of
President Paul Kagame, Rwandan officials told AFP Wednesday.


Rwanda says the warrants issued as part of an investigation into
the death of Kagame's predecessor "violate its sovereignty and
curtail its capacity to function freely and normally as a
sovereign state" and "set a dangerous precedent".


The complaint was filed with the International Court of Justice
(ICJ), but is unlikely to come before the United Nations judges
as France does not recognise the competence of the ICJ in this
case.


The ICJ said Wednesday that it had received the complaint but
explained in a press release that no action will be taken unless
France agrees to have the court settle the dispute.


Last November, Jean-Louis Bruguiere, France's top anti-terrorism
judge issued warrants for nine top Rwandan officials and said
Kagame should face trial for the assassination of his
predecessor, Juvenal Habyarimana.


Bruguiere is heading an investigation into the deadly 1994 attack
against Rwanda's former president that triggered the African
nation's genocide in which some 800,000 people perished.


The international arrest warrants state that the nine officials,
all close associates of Kagame, are wanted for assassination or
complicity in assassination.
