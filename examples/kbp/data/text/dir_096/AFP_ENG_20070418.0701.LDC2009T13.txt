Tanzanian authorities Wednesday indefinitely closed the country's
main university after students boycotted lectures demanding full
academic sponsorship, officials said.


The University of Dar es Salaam vice chancellor Rwekaza Mukandala
said the institution was shut after students rejected appeals to
be patient as the issue was under review.


"The students remained out for the classes for two days. Council
of the university has therefore decided to close the varsity
indefinitely and all undergraduate students were asked to leave
by 6.00 pm Tuesday," he told AFP.


The closure comes after months of wrangling between the
government and the students' union over financial support.
Currently, the government covers 60 percent of financial
requirement, but the students are pressing for all fees to be
paid.
