Upbeat earnings news helped power the leading Dow Jones
Industrial Average index to a record closing high Wednesday as
the blue chip share gauge climbed above 12,800 points for the
first time.


The benchmark Dow index jumped 30.80 points (0.24 percent) to
12,803.84 at the closing bell, bursting its prior all-time
closing high of 12,786.64 which was struck in late February.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index gained 1.06 points
(0.07 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,472.54, but technology
stocks did not fare so well.


The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index ended down 6.45 points
(0.26 percent) at 2,510.50.


Analysts said a better-than-forecast first quarter profit report
from Wall Street banking titan JPMorgan Chase had helped boost
the Dow. JPMorgan Chase said its quarterly profits ballooned 55
percent to 4.8 billion dollars.
