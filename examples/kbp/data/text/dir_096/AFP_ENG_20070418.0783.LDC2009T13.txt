A Canadian special forces soldier died in an accident Wednesday
in Afghanistan, local media reported quoting military officials
in Kandahar.


The soldier fell from a communications tower in Kandahar, said
Colonel Mike Cessford, describing it as "a tragic accident."


Cessford said the soldier was the first Canadian special forces
soldier to die in Afghanistan.


His death brought to 54 the number of soldiers, in addition to
one diplomat, who have lost their lives in Afghanistan since the
beginning of Canada's mission there in 2002.


Six Canadian soldiers were killed earlier this month in a
roadside bomb explosion and two more soldiers died a few days
later under similar circumstances.
