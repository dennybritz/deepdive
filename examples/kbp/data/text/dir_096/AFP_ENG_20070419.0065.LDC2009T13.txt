French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on Thursday called on
French Jews to vote for him in the upcoming presidential
election, in an interview with an Israeli newspaper.


"Jews who are French and linked to France, and whose interests
are those of France, should vote for me as a bloc," Le Pen,
standing in his fifth and probably final presidential election,
told the Hebrew-language Maariv daily.


Le Pen, who sparked outrage in 1987 when he described World War
II Nazi death camps as a "detail of history," is not known for
enjoying widespread support among France's Jewish voters.


But the 78-year-old National Front leader said in Thursday's
interview that, "I have Jewish friends and there are Jews in my
party," adding that "the Jews are divided in France according to
their social status."


He said that his comments in 1987 did not amount to a denial of
the Holocaust.


"I did not deny the Holocaust," he told Maariv. "I only said
simply that the gas chambers did not constitute but a detail in
the history of World War II. It is not something that should
provoke anger."


"The fact is that some Jews voted for me in 2002. They no doubt
sense better than me the dangers that face our country because of
the situation with security."


Le Pen, who is currently in fourth place ahead of the first-round
vote on Sunday, became a force to be reckoned with in French
politics when he qualified for the runoff vote in the 2002
election against Jacques Chirac, beating Socialist Lionel Jospin.
