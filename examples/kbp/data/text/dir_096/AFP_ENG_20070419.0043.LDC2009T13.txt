Microsoft Corp. and Samsung Electronics Company announced a deal
on Thursday to share patented technologies.


The Redmond, Washington, software giant and the South Korea-based
electronics titan have a "broad patent cross-licensing agreement"
that they say will accelerate development of new products at both
companies.


"Patent collaboration agreements like this expand access to ideas
and lead to even more desirable products," said Samsung senior
vice president Shung-Hyun Cho.


Under the terms of the deal, Samsung will get Microsoft
technology that can be used for such products as computers,
digital media players, camcorders, televisions, printers, home
appliances and television set-top-boxes.


Microsoft will gain access to Samsung's patent portfolio relating
to digital media and computer devices.


Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed but both
parties will be paid for use of proprietary technology.


"We are always looking for new opportunities to work
collaboratively within the industry and Samsung was a natural
fit," said Microsoft vice president Horacio Gutierrez.


"Companies that collaborate are in the best position to deliver
the products and service that their customers demand."


In the past 12 months, Microsoft has announced similar agreements
with companies such as Novell, NEC, Fuji-Xerox, Seiko-Epson and
Nortel.
