Japanese lefthander Kei Igawa pitched six steady innings for his
first major league baseball win Wednesday, with a little help
from Yankees' teammate Alex Rodriguez.


Rodriguez hit his ninth home run of the young season as the
Yankees defeated Cleveland 9-2, pounding the Indians for the
second night in a row.


One night after pounding out 10 hits in a 10-3 victory over the
Indians to give Chase Wright a win in his major league debut, the
Yankees continued to assault Cleveland's pitching staff.


New York roughed up Indians lefthander Jeremy Sowers, knocking
him out of the game with a five-run third inning for a 6-2 lead.


Igawa, who was signed to five-year, 20 million-dollar contract in
December, made it stand up through his six innings, permitting
two runs - both earned - and five hits while strikingout five and
walking one.


It was his longest outing in his third start.


The Yankees continued to pour it on after Igawa's night was done,
as Rodriguez continued his red-shot start by golfing a two-run
blast to left and Jason Giambi followed with a solo shot in the
bottom of the sixth for a 9-2 cushion.


Rodriguez now has hit in all 13 games and 18 dating to the 2006
regular season. The third baseman has driven in 23 runs to go
along with his nine homers - both tops in the majors.


Derek Jeter went 3-for-5 to extend his hitting streak to nine
games and every starter had at least one hit as the Yankees
collected 14 to take the first two games of the series.


Three relievers finished up with a scoreless inning apiece for
New York.
