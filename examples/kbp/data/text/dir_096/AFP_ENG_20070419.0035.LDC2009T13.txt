The United States on Thursday confirmed the body found in a
mountainous area in the northern Philippines was that of a
missing Peace Corps volunteer.


"Philippine authorities will make final pronouncement of the
cause of death," the embassy said in a statement, as the remains
of Julia Campbell, 40, were flown to Manila for an autopsy.


"The US Peace Corps is saddened by the loss of such a dedicated
and vibrant volunteer, who so loved this country. Our hearts go
out to her family and friends in the United States," Peace Corps
director Ronald Tschetter said.


Campbell went missing on Easter Sunday while hiking a mountain
trail in the northern village of Batad, a picturesque hamlet
fringed with terraced mountainsides planted with rice.


There have been suggestions of foul play, and police said the
case remains under criminal investigation.


Regional police chief Superintendent Raul Gonzales on Wednesday
said the body "appears to have been intentionally buried."


The English teacher, one of 137 Peace Corps volunteers working in
the Philippines, had last been seen on the afternoon of April 8
when she was hiking on a trail leading to Batad.


The mountainous northern region is home to the Banaue rice
terraces, a world- famous tourist spot.


Communist rebels once plagued the area, but the crime rate has
remained low and attacks on foreigners are rare.
