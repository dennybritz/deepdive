Suspected Islamic rebels have shot dead two men in separate
shootings in Thailand's restive Muslim-majority south, police
said Thursday.


A 44-year-old Muslim was gunned down late Wednesday in a drive-by
shooting while riding a motorcycle in Yala, one of three
insurgency-torn southern provinces bordering Malaysia, they said.


In nearby Narathiwat province, a 52-year-old Muslim was shot dead
by three gunmen at his motorcycle late Wednesday, police said.


The shootings followed a string of bomb attacks on power lines
Wednesday in Narathiwat and the killing of three Buddhists,
including a 50-year-old man who was later beheaded by militants.


The bomb attacks briefly caused a power blackout in the province.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in the violence-torn
provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani since the separatist
insurgency erupted in January 2004.


The violence has escalated over the past six months despite moves
by the military-backed government to bring peace to the troubled
region.
