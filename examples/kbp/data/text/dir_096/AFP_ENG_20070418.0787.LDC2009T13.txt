Asian American Coal Inc (AACI) will develop its second coal mine
in China with a local partner in the northern province of Shanxi
for three billion yuan (389 million dollars), state media said
Thursday.


AACI will hold a 45 percent stake in the project, with the
remaining 55 percent being taken by the Lu'an Group, the Shanghai
Securities News reported, citing Zou Xiangdong, the US company's
chief executive officer.


The mine has reserves of about 600 million tonnes and a projected
annual output of six million tonnes.


It is under construction at present and expected to go into
operation in the second half of 2009, Zou said.


AACI was formed by US coal mining companies and financial
institutions to invest in coal production, preparation, coal
sales and coal-bed methane projects in China.


In 2000, the company and China's Shanxi Lanhua Group jointly
invested in developing Daning coal mine, in which AACI holds 56
percent, becoming the first multinational engaged in coal mining
in China, the report said.
