A South Korean appeal court on Thursday upheld a 10-year prison
sentence for a North Korean spy, in the second espionage case
this week in Seoul.


A lower court convicted Jeong Kyeong-Hak of sneaking into a
nuclear power facility and military bases and taking photos of
them in the late 1990s.


The Seoul High Court said the conviction was "proper" and that
Jeong had been treated leniently since he had tried to recruit
other spies, Yonhap news agency reported.


On Monday a court in the city sentenced an ethnic Korean US
citizen to nine years in jail for spying for the communist North.


Judges found Michael Jang, 44, guilty of providing confidential
information to the North, holding meetings with its spies,
illegally entering Pyongyang and possessing material praising the
North.


He was convicted under the tough National Security Law, which
remains in force despite moves in recent years to improve North-
South relations.


The court Monday also handed down jail terms of four to six years
on four South Korean former student activists for assisting Jang.


North and South Korea have remained technically at war since the
1950-1953 conflict ended in a fragile armistice, not a peace
treaty.
