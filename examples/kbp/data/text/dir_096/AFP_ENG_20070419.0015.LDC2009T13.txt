A Malaysian woman has reportedly claimed that she gave birth to
twins last month -- but only got one baby from the hospital.


The 38-year-old woman said she was awake during the Caesarean
operation on March 21 and is convinced two babies were removed
from her womb, although the hospital said she only had one girl.


The health ministry will investigate, the New Straits Times paper
said. It said health officials had repeatedly told here she would
only have one baby, while she and her husband maintained that
they had been expecting two.
