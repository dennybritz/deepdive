Belgian Discovery Channel rider Gianni Meersman won the Tour of
Georgia third stage on Wednesday, as Saunier Duval's David Canada
Gracia took the overall lead.


Meersman emerged from a leading group to grab the victory in the
190km stage from Rome, Georgia, by one second over Canada Gracia
of Spain.


About 30km into the stage, a group of 13 riders broke away and
built a commanding lead heading into the final climb 15km from
the finish.


Four riders fell away in the closing stages, while an escape by
Belgian Kevin Seeldrayers and Switzerland's Rubens Bertogliati
was quickly reeled in.


Health Net's Jeff Louder attacked but was chased down by
Discovery's Janez Brajkovic, BMC's Scott Nydam, and Meersman.


Meersman overtook Louder to seize the victory in 4hr 33min 18sec,
ahead of Canada Gracia, with Slovenia's Janez Brajkovic third.


Canada Gracia took the overall lead with a total time of 13hr
34min 21sec.


Thursday's stage four is a 30.4km individual time trial from
Chickamauga, Georgia, to Lookout Mountain, Georgia.


The race concludes on Sunday in Atlanta.
