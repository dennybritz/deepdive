The green group WWF Wednesday urged the Russian government to set
up a national reserve in the country's far-east to protect the
endangered Amur leopard.


According to the last survey carried out by Russian and American
scientists, between 24 and 35 leopards remain in their natural
habitat spread over three reserves located near the Chinese
border and along the Amur river.


"Instead of three reserves where the nearby human presence
constitutes a menace for the survival of the fauna, the Russian
government can set up a national reserve spread over 200,000
hectares," Igor Tchestine, head of the WWF's Russian chapter told
a press conference.


"Zoos have several hundreds of Amur leopards and these could be
set free," there, he said.


Amur leopards are indigenous only to eastern Russia and China and
are targetted by poachers.


A female leopard fetches up to 50,000 dollars (36,000 euros)
while the penalty for killing one is only 20,000 roubles, said
Oleg Mitvol, the number two at the Russian ecological watchdog
Rosprirodnadzor.


"In China there are only a handful of Amur leopards left," he
said. "All the body parts of the female are used for making
medicines -- even whiskers and teeth."
