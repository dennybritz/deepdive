The gunman who killed at least 30 students on a Virginia college
campus sent photographs, video and writings to NBC News, police
said Wednesday.


"Earlier today, NBC News in New York received correspondence that
we believe to have been from Cho Seung-Hui, the gunman
responsible for the fatal shootings in Norris Hall," police
superintendent Steve Flaherty told a news conference.


"The correspondence included multiple photographs, video and
writings. Upon receipt of this correspondence, NBC News
immediately notified authorities."


Flaherty said the material had been turned over to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, but gave no details about what it
contained except to say there were "writings and images."


"This may be a very new critical component of this investigation.
We are in the process right now of attempting to analyze and
evaluate its worth," he said.


The 23-year-old South Korean native launched a fatal rampage at
Virginia Tech University on Monday before turning the gun on
himself. The killings marked the deadliest school shooting in US
history.
