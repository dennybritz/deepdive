VfB Stuttgart booked their place in the German Cup final at
Berlin's Olympic Stadium next month with a convincing 1-0 win
over VfL Wolfsburg on Wednesday night.


Midfielder Antonio da Silva grabbed the game's only goal when he
smashed his free-kick over the wall after 16 minutes and gave
Wolfsburg's goalkeeper Simon Jentzsch no chance as Stuttgart
dominated the game.


In the final on May 26, Stuttgart will face Nuremburg who humbled
Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 in Tuesday night's other semi-final.


Having led 2-0 at the break, goals by Marco Engelhardt, Ivan
Saenko, Tomas Galasek and Chhunly Pagenburg were enough to put
Nuremburg through as Frankfurt were well beaten.
