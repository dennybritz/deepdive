China became a net coal importer for the first time on a
quarterly basis in the first three months of the year, state
media said Thursday.


Net imports of about 2.9 million tonnes reflected continued brisk
demand at home, combined with official efforts consolidate the
domestic industry, the China Daily reported.


Coal imports surged 60.4 percent from a year earlier to 14.3
million tonnes in the first quarter of this year, while exports
dropped 32 percent to 11.4 million tonnes, the paper reported,
citing customs figures.


China, the world's second largest coal exporter as late as 2003,
last year saw its exports tumble 11.7 percent to 63.3 million
tonnes, the third consecutive annual decrease.


Imports, by contrast, jumped 46.1 percent to 38.3 million tonnes
in 2006, boosted by voracious demand from the world's fastest
growing major economy.


Experts said the reversal could be attributed to the government's
latest policies to tighten curbs on pollution and safety
requirements and to preserve domestic energy resources, the
report said.


A total production loss is estimated to reach 380 million tonnes
through 2010 as the country has closed thousands of small-scaled
mines since last year, it said.


Growth of fixed asset investment in the industry dropped from
65.6 percent in 2005 to 27.2 percent in 2006 and 2.3 percent in
the first two months this year due to suspension of the approval
of coal mine projects, it added.
