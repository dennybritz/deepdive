A leader of the Uzbekistan Islamic Movement, branded by
Washington as a terrorist outfit, has been arrested in
neighbouring Tajikistan, police said Tuesday.


"The police have arrested Safar Safarov, 36, a chief of the
Uzbekistan Islamic Movement at Macha in northern Tajikistan where
the Islamists have a lot of sympathisers," a spokesman for the
Tajikistan police told AFP.


"Safarov is suspected of having contacts with peers in
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and southern Kyrgyzstan," he
said, adding that he was suspected of trying to call for a coup.


US forces bombed a base of the Movement in Afghanistan in 2001 in
which its leader, Dzhuma Namangani, was killed.
