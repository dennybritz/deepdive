A second suicide bomber blew himself up Tuesday in the Moroccan
port city of Casablanca, hours after another suicide blast during
a police raid in the same area, an AFP journalist saw.


The journalist saw the torn and dismembered remains of the bomber
in the street following the blast around 1530 GMT. Another body
lay nearby but it was not clear if there were any fatalities
other than the bomber.
