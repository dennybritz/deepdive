A man hijacked a Turkish airliner carrying 180 passengers and
crew on Tuesday but gave himself up to authorities after it
landed in Ankara, television channels reported.


"The hijacker, of Turkish nationality, has given himself up to
police and been taken into custody," transport ministry spokesman
Ibrahim Sahin told journalists at Ankara.


The hijacker, Mehmet Goksin Gol, 39, was unarmed and had a police
record for trafficking in drugs and possessing illegal weapons,
media reports said.


Gol hijacked a Boeing 737-800 run by the private Turkish airline
Pegasus flying from Diyarbakir, a Kurdish-majority city in south-
eastern Anatolia, to Istanbul.


The plane, carrying 174 passengers, including three babies, and
six crew took off from Diyarbakir at 5:40 pm (1440 GMT).


Sahin said Gol was unarmed and added that his demands were not
clear.


Turkish Transport Minister Binali Yildirim meanwhile told CNN
that the hijacker did not appear to have any political motives.


"A normal man does not do such a thing," he said.


The passengers would be continuing their journey on another
plane, said Sahin.


One passenger told CNN-Turk television that the hijacker had said
he had a bomb attached to his belt and that at one point he had
read verses from the Koran.


"He didn't seem to be in full possession of his mental
faculties," the passenger added.


Earlier television news reports had said the man had wanted the
plane to go to Iran.
