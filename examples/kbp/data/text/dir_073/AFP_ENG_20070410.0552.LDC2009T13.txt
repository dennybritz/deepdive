The White House on Tuesday hailed the announcement of a
breakthrough toward unfreezing North Korean funds which could
lead to the long-awaited shutdown of North Korea's nuclear
plants.


"I think that as North Korea nears its deadline, that this step
was a big one," deputy spokeswoman Dana Perino said.


"We have been assured (the money) is going to be used for
humanitarian and education reasons."


In the first phase of a six-country agreement, the North had
agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear reactor by this Saturday
in exchange for badly needed fuel oil.


However, North Korea had refused to close it until it received 25
million dollars in funds frozen in the Banco Delta Asia (BDA) in
Macau, after Washington blacklisted the bank for allegedly
laundering illicit funds.


The US State Department announced earlier Tuesday that
authorities in Macau had unfrozen North Korean bank accounts.
