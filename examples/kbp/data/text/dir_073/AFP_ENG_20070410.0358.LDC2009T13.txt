Russia's state-owned Vneshtorgbank announced record net profits
Tuesday ahead of the bank's initial public offering, which its
chairman promised would be the largest in the sector worldwide
this year.


IFRS net profit for 2006 came to 1.179 billion dollars, a hike of
130.7 percent on 2005, chairman Andrei Kostin told journalists in
Moscow.


The bank's proprietory funds rose to seven billion dollars from
5.3 billion dollars in 2005, while the bank's assets grew more
than 40 percent on the previous year to 52 billion, Kostin said.


Vneshtorgbank, which is 99.9 percent state-owned, on Monday began
to accept requests from private individuals looking to buy its
shares ahead of a May 7 deadline.


The share offering will be "the largest IPO in the world this
year in the banking sector," Kostin said.


Approximately 30 percent of the shares will be put on the Russian
market, where they will be offered simultaneously to private
individuals and institutional investors, with under 70 percent to
be offered to institutional investors in London, the bank said.


The attracted funds will be used to develop Vneshtorgbank's
retail and investment banking arms, Kostin said.
