Californian authorities late Monday blocked a bid by Australian
mining giant BHP Billiton to build a permanent natural gas
terminal off the US state's coastline.


The California State Lands Commission voted 2-1 against approving
an environmental report on the project, which would see BHP base
the floating terminal 14 miles offshore from Malibu, west of Los
Angeles.


BHP had sought to moor the terminal -- reported to be bigger than
an aircraft carrier -- in order to unload liquefied natural gas
and process it before pumping it ashore.


The terminal and its fleet of carriers would be visible from the
coastline on clear days, according to environmental studies.


Supporters of the terminal said it would help to provide
California with clean- burning natural gas and said it would meet
all local and federal environmental laws.


However environmental groups and Malibu-based celebrities such as
Tom Hanks and Pierce Brosnan voiced opposition to the plan,
questioning the impact of the terminal on the coastline.


Malibu's city council and almost every elected official
representing the area also expressed opposition to the project on
environmental and energy-policy grounds.


A local county ruled last year that the bid did not meet local
and federal clean air laws.


California's Coastal Commission said last week that BHP's
proposed technology would deposit hundreds of tons of soot and
smog annually near the Los Angeles basin, in violation of local
regulations.
