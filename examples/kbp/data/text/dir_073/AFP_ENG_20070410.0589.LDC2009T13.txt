US rap star Snoop Dogg could face up to four years in prison
after being hit with felony weapons and drugs charges, Los
Angeles prosecutors said Tuesday.


The district attorney's office said the 35-year-old rapper --
real name Calvin Broadus -- would be arraigned in Pasadena on
Wednesday on charges of gun possession by a felon and sale or
transportation of marijuana.


The charges relate to an incident last October at Burbank's Bob
Hope airport when police discovered marijuana in the musician's
vehicle while confronting him over a parking violation.


The gun charge was added later after the weapon was discovered at
the rapper's home by police, authorities said.


It is illegal for convicted felons to own a weapon in the US --
Broadus was convicted of felony drug charges in 1990.


If convicted of the two latest charges the rap-star faces up to
four years in state prison, prosecutors said.


The latest charges are part of mushrooming legal woes facing the
rapper, who has separate outstanding cases in other parts of
California.


He pleaded not guilty to possession of a deadly weapon in January
after an outlawed collapsible police baton was found in his
luggage as he attempted to catch a flight to San Francisco in
September last year.


He was also arrested in Los Angeles on November 28 for weapon and
drugs possession offences.


Last month Broadus was arrested in Sweden for suspected drug use.
The rapper has had several brushes with the law since being tried
and acquitted for murder in 1993, the year he found fame with his
debut album "Doggystyle."
