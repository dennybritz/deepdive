A top executive with a troubled Canadian pet food maker sold
almost half of his shares in the company only a few weeks before
a massive recall of its tainted products, a report said Tuesday.


Insider trading reports show Menu Foods chief financial officer
Mark Wiens sold 14,000 units for about 102,000 Canadian dollars
(90,000 US) on February 26 and 27.


The shares would now be worth only 62,500 dollars based on the
Toronto-based company's latest share price.


"It's a horrible coincidence," Wiens told the Globe and Mail
newspaper.


"I hold myself to the highest ethical and moral standards
possible. I wouldn't do anything to imperil the high governance
standards that I demand of myself or anybody in the company."


Menu Foods recalled 60 million cans and pouches of food made in
the United States and sold under 95 different brand names after
reports that house pets were falling sick and dying after eating
their products.


After tests, the FDA confirmed it had found melamine, also used
in the manufacture of plastics, in wheat gluten imported from
China and used in the Menu Foods products.


Dozens of pets died after eating the tainted pet food in the
United States.


The first reports of pet illness surfaced in late February. But
Wiens told the Globe and Mail that he did not learn about
possible contaminated pet food until early March.


Several lawsuits have been filed in US and Canadian courts
following the pet deaths.


Menu Foods President Paul Henderson has said the company would
compensate owners of animals that died or became ill from its
products.
