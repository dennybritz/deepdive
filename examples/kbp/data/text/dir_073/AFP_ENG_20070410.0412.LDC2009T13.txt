The once-popular ex-mayor of a Danish town was on Tuesday
sentenced to two years in prison for squandering tax payers'
money on fine wines and free computers to residents, the Danish
news agency Ritzau reported.


Peter Brixtofte was long hailed as the mayor of the town of
Farum, population 19,000, as the municipality flourished
economically and public services were extended. Residents were
given free computers and senior citizens were given free holiday
trips to sunny destinations.


But the bubble burst in 2002 when Danish newspaper B.T. began
investigating the municipality's finances, and the scandal became
a national affair.


Brixtofte, who was mayor from 1985 to 2002, was on Tuesday found
guilty of breach of trust, three years after the court case
began.


In addition to his freespending, he was also found to have signed
on to vast loans for the municipality without having sought the
approval of the city council.


He has appealed Tuesday's conviction, Ritzau said.


Brixtofte has already been sentenced to two years in prison for
another corruption scandal involving kickbacks paid to a
construction company for the renovation of a Farum sporting
centre.


He lost an appeal in that case, and has taken the matter to
Denmark's Supreme Court, which has yet to issue a ruling.
