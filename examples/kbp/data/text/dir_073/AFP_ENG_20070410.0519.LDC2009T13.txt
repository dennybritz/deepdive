A Bahamas court Tuesday ruled that Larry Birkhead, the former
boyfriend of late Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith, was the father
of her baby daughter, ending months of feverish speculation.


The ruling wiped out rival paternity claims by Smith's long-time
companion, Howard Stern, and actress Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband
Frederic van Anhalt who had filed a lawsuit claiming he had
fathered Smith's daughter Dannielynn.
