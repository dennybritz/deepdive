An intense burst of fighting including mortar fire broke the
uneasy ceasefire between Ethiopian forces and Islamist fighters
backed by clan militia in the Somali capital Mogadishu late
Tuesday.


An AFP journalist heard the exchanges, which included mortar
fire, from 10:30 pm (1930 GMT).


The exchange of fire lasted for about 20 minutes near the city's
stadium, which has already been the scene of fierce fighting
between the two sides.


The latest exchange was the first break in the uneasy ceasefire
since Friday.


It came after Hawiye clan elders said earlier Tuesday that the
fighting, between March 29 and April 1, had killed more than a
thousand people in the Somali capital.


The clashes which erupted when Ethiopian forces launched a bloody
crackdown on suspected insurgents in the Somali capital, also
left 4,334 people wounded, Hussein Aden Korgab, the Hawiye clan
spokesman, told AFP.


Somalia has lacked an effective central government since the
ousting of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 touched off a
power struggle that exploded into inter-clan warfare.


More than 14 attempts to restore a functional government in
Somalia have since failed.
