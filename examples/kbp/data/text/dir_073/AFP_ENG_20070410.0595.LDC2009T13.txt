The San Diego Padres inked righthanded hurler Chris Young to a
four-year deal on Tuesday, one day after he tossed seven
outstanding innings in a 1-0 win over San Francisco.


Young, a former basketball player at Princeton University, is 1-0
with a 2.13 ERA in two starts this season.


"Chris has emerged as one of the elite pitchers in the game, and
I believe he will be a cornerstone in our rotation for many years
to come," Padres general manager Kevin Towers said. "His
professional demeanor on and off the field exemplifies what it
means to be a Padre."


Acquired from the Texas Rangers in January 2006, Young went 11-5
with a 3.46 ERA in 31 starts for San Diego last season. The 27
-year-old was one of baseball's stingiest pitchers last year,
limiting opposing batters to a National League-low .206 average.


Young also has been superb on the road, going 9-0 over his last
25 road outings. He joined Allie Reynolds as the only pitchers in
major league history to go 25 consecutive road starts without a
loss.
