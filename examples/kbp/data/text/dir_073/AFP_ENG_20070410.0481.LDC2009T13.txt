Premier Rugby have written to International Rugby Board (IRB)
chairman Dr Syd Millar requesting a round-table meeting with all
parties involved in the European Cup stand-off.


Dr Millar blasted the English and French clubs on Monday for
their decision to withdraw from both tiers of European
competition next season in a row over voting and shareholding
rights.


And Premier Rugby, the Premiership clubs' umbrella body,
responded Tuesday by writing to Dr Millar requesting a meeting
between the IRB, the English and French unions and the respective
clubs' bodies.


"Now is not a time for accusation. It should be a time for urgent
discussion on how to resolve differences, and should involve all
the parties," said chief executive Mark McCafferty.


"PRL has made it clear that it supports a new European
competition inclusive of all countries and under International
Rugby Board governance, which reflects the interests of all
parties.


"It is encouraging from yesterday's statement that the
International Rugby Board wants the voice of clubs in all
countries to be heard and listened to within the system.


"Therefore, PRL has today written to the chairman of the IRB
asking for a meeting together with Ligue National de Rugby, the
Rugby Football Union and the Federation Francaise de Rugby."


The Anglo-French clubs' decision not to compete in Europe stems
from the RFU's refusal to hand over 50 percent of its
shareholding and voting rights in ERC to Premier Rugby.
