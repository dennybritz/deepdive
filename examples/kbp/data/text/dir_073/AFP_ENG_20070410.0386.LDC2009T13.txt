The presidents of eight European Union states on Tuesday gathered
for talks on the challenges facing the 27-nation bloc, officials
said.


President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia invited counterparts
from Austria (Heinz Fischer), Finland (Tarja Halonen), Germany
(Horst Koehler), Hungary (Laszlo Solyom), Italy (Giorgio
Napolitano), Poland (Lech Kaczynski) and Portugal (Anibal Cavaco
Silva) for the two-day meeting.


It is the fourth such gathering of the group, which was set up by
Portugal's president, Jorge Sampaio, in 2003 to enable an
informal exchange of views among participating countries'
political leaders, policymakers and academics.


"The academic debate will be an open discussion -- an attempt to
formulate European values 50 years after the Treaty of Rome,"
organiser Zaneta Ozolina, head of the Latvian president's
Strategic Analysis Commission, told AFP.


"The discussions will touch upon the problem of governance in
Europe, the legitimacy of democracy, immigration and common
foreign policy," she said.
