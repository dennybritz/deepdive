Mozambique will host a meeting between fellow Portuguese-speaking
countries and Chinese officials this month to discuss how to
deepen economic and commercial ties, organisers said Tuesday.


The two-day meeting from April 18 will discuss the possibility of
developing Macau as a base for Portuguese-speaking businessmen,
according to a statement by the Mozambican institute of export
promotion, the event's co-organisers.


Macau is a former Portuguese protectorate, situated close to Hong
Kong, that reverted to Chinese rule in 2000.


The government in Beijing has been striving hard to forge
stronger ties with Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa,
particularly Mozambique and Angola which is now one of China's
major suppliers of oil.


Other countries which are set to be represented at the meeting
are Brazil, Portugal, East Timor, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, and
Sao Tome and Principe.
