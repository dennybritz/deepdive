Sudan accused Chad of violating border agreements between the two
countries signed in Tripoli last year following deadly clashes
between the two countries.


"The Chadian government has shown no inclination to respect these
accords," said the minister of state for foreign affairs, Ali
Karti, in the presence of the ambassadors of Chad, Libya and
Eritrea, state radio reported.


Libya and Eritrea helped broker the February 2006 Tripoli
agreement which Sudan maintains have been unobserved for the past
year.


Armed forces from the two nations clashed along the border late
Monday, resulting in at least 30 dead, according to the Chadian
government, which said it was chasing gunmen from Sudan.
