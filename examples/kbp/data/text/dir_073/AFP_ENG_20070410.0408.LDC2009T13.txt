South Africa were 158-1 after 30 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against West Indies at the Grenada National Stadium
Tuesday.


AB de Villiers was on 72 with Jacques Kallis on 71.


Captain Graeme Smith was the first man out, caught behind by
Denesh Ramdin for eight off Corey Colleymore in the seventh over
with the score on 21.


Brian Lara, whose side need to win all three of their remaining
Super Eight matches to keep their chances of reaching the semi-
finals alive, won the toss and put South Africa into bat.


There were three changes from the West Indian side that lost by
113 runs against Sri Lanka in Guyana in their most recent match
nine days ago.


Local favourite, Grenada batsman Devon Smith, replaced Marlon
Samuels, while Kieron Pollard and Corey Collymore came in for
Dwayne Smith and Jerome Taylor.


South Africa included batsman Herschelle Gibbs, who suffered a
calf strain during his team's shock loss against Bangladesh in
Guyana Saturday.


South Africa, who have gained one more win than the West Indies
in the Super Eight phase but also might need to win all their
last three matches, made two changes.


Batsman Loots Bosman replaced Justin Kemp, while all-rounder
Andrew Hall returned in place of Charl Langeveldt.
