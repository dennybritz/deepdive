Global banking behemoth Citigroup is on the verge of announcing a
major overhaul of its operations that will see over 26,000 jobs
eliminated or reassigned, according to US media reports Tuesday.


The New York Times said the jobs cuts and reassignments would
affect over 26,000 employees but other reports suggested a lower
number of under 20,000 posts.


A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports, but
the banking giant is due to announce the results of a wide-
ranging expense review early Wednesday to investors.


The New York Times, which cited people close to the plans, said
the potential workforce changes would affect about eight percent
of the firm's employees.


Citigroup's total headcount is 327,000.


The financial powerhouse and its chief executive Charles Prince,
who is due to participate in Wednesday's announcement, have come
heavy pressure from leading shareholders and investors in recent
months to slash Citigroup's expenses.


The bank is also facing stiff competition from rival Bank of
America which has expanded aggressively in recent years.


Citigroup has been mulling relocating staff from expensive New
York offices elsewhere where costs are lower as part of its cost
review, according to press reports in recent weeks.


The Times report suggested that potential job cuts would target
the bank's compliance departments which were beefed up following
several scandals after government and congressional probes
revealed Citigroup's dealings with Enron and WorldCom.
