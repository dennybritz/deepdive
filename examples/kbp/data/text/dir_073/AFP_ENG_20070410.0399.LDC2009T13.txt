Suspected arson caused major damage to a German museum for an
artist murdered in the Holocaust that was designed by US star
architect Daniel Libeskind, a police spokesman said Tuesday.


The blaze broke out Monday at the Felix Nussbaum Museum in the
western city of Osnabrueck, which has the world's largest
collection of works by the Jewish painter who was persecuted by
the Nazis and killed at the Auschwitz death camp.


The fire destroyed about 10 square metres (108 square feet) of
the wooden facade of the building. Investigators are treating the
case as arson but said there was no indication it was politically
motivated.


"We do not yet know if it was intentional or due to negligence,"
the spokesman said, adding that the blaze had caused thousands of
euros (dollars) worth of damage.


Firefighters found a burning pile of fabric next to the building.
One theory was that a homeless person seeking shelter on the
museum grounds might have set the blaze. Osnabrueck has seen a
rash of similar fires recently.


The building, which opened in 1998 as an extension of
Osnabrueck's Cultural History Museum, bears the jagged lines and
maze-like design Libeskind later used in his landmark Jewish
Museum in Berlin.


Nussbaum was born in Osnabrueck in 1904 and became a leading
painter and graphic artist in the 1920s and 1930s. After years in
exile due to the rise of the Nazis in Germany, he was deported
and killed at Auschwitz in 1944.
