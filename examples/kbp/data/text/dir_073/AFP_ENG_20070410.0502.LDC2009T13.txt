Sierra Leone has banned the wearing of military fatigues or their
imitation in the war-scarred country in a bid to stem a wave of
crime by rogues masquerading as soldiers, the army said Tuesday.


"It is illegal for any civilian to put on a military hat, T-shirt
or whatever that belongs to the armed forces of this country,"
Brigadier Robert Koroma, the joint chief of staff told a news
conference.


"Criminals are in the habit of using military camouflage whenever
they want to perpetrate armed robbery and other related crimes,"
he said.


Former fighters of the now defunct Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rebels had succeeded in giving the military a bad name by
wearing military garb when they wanted to attack towns and
villages.


"This time around, the military will definitely kick against any
ugly attempt by anyone to do so," he said.


Violation of the ban attracts a maximum of a three-months jail
term.
