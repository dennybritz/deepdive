A trainer at California's world-famous SeaWorld marine park was
injured after being struck by a killer whale's tail during an
artificial insemination procedure, reports said Tuesday.


The 35-year-old female trainer was knocked off a three-foot (one-
meter) wall when she was swiped by the animal's tail and was
taken to hospital for minor back injuries, local broadcast
reports said.


Officials at SeaWorld in San Diego were not immediately available
for comment but were reported to have scheduled a news conference
later in the day.


The incident comes after a male trainer at SeaWorld was attacked
by a killer whale last November. The trainer was dragged
underwater by the whale in front of horrified spectators before
being released.


The trainer eventually recovered after being hospitalized.
