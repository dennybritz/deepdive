Manchester United hit Roma for a magnificent seven at Old
Trafford on Tuesday to book a Champions League semi-final with
either AC Milan or Bayern Munich.


Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, United looked on the brink of a
European exit against the Italians but a 7-1 destruction of Roma
in their quarter-final second leg gave them an 8-3 aggregate
victory.


Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice and Alan
Smith, Wayne Rooney and Patrice Evra got one each as they romped
to their biggest European win since 1968.
