WBO super-middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe confirmed Tuesday
that he suffered a broken hand during his weekend stoppage
victory against Peter Manfredo here.


The 35-year-old Welshman has a history of hand problems and
suffered another fracture against his American opponent at the
Millennium Stadium en route to a third-round victory - the 20th
defence of his title.


"I'm disappointed that I fractured my hand but that's boxing and
injuries happen," said Calzaghe, who remains hopeful of a speedy
recovery ahead of his proposed next fight in July.


"I shouldn't be out for too long though, probably about four
weeks, and then I'll be back to light training in preparation for
the proposed July date which I am really excited about."


The win saw Calzaghe draw level with greats Larry Holmes and
Bernard Hopkins for the consecutive number of world title
defences, in front of a record crowd of more than 35,018.


Calzaghe's promoter Frank Warren is now trying to lure US
middleweight king Jermain Taylor for July's fight, although a
defence against Denis Inkin at the 02 Arena, the renamed
Millennium Dome, is seen as a stronger possibility.
