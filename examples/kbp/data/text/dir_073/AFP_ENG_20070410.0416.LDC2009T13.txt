An 11th century Viking longship that has been entirely restored
to its original condition will cross the North Sea this summer
powered only by its sails, a Danish Viking ship museum said on
Tuesday.


The ship will leave Roskilde, Denmark, where the museum is
located, on July 1 and is expected to arrive in Dublin on August
14, project leader Preben Rather Soerensen told AFP.


"This is a new challenge. We used the tools the Vikings used to
rebuild the Havhingsten fra Glendalough and now we are going to
test the ship's resistance," he said.


Sixty-five sailors will man the 30-meter (98-foot) vessel, which
will have no engine and will rely entirely on its typically
square Viking sail. The oars will only be used in ports for
delicate maneuvers.


The ship is the biggest Viking ship ever rebuilt.


The ship's hull was found at the bottom of the Roskilde fjord in
1962. The renovation work began in 2000.


Four years later, the Havhingsten fra Glendalough was first
tested in the water, and has since sailed several short journeys.


"The ship was built in 1042 in Dublin and now we going to return
her to the waters she was meant to sail in," Soerensen said.


The longship took part in clashes between the Anglo-Saxons and
Normans in 1050-1060, a period when many Danish Vikings lived in
Ireland. The ship was taking part in a raid on the Danish coast
when it was sunk by the Danes themselves off of Roskilde.
