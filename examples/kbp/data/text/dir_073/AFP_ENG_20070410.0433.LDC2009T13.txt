The Iberia board of directors could decide on a 3.4-billion-euro
(4.5-billion- dollar) takeover approach from a private US equity
group when it meets later this week, a spokeswoman for the
Spanish national carrier said Tuesday.


Texas Pacific Group, the buyout firm, asked Iberia for financial
information on March 30 with a view to making a bid worth 3.60
euros per share for the Spanish airline.


Iberia closed at 4.03 euros a share on Thursday, the last day the
Spanish bourse was open before the Easter holidays. Iberia closed
at 4.08 euros on Tuesday, a gain of 1.24 percent from Thursday.


The board could decide to reject the offer outright, share the
information or request more information from the buyout firm on
its takeover plans and possible partners.


Separately, the spokeswoman refused to comment on a report by
Spanish news agency EFE that Germany's Lufthansa was preparing to
offer 4.0 euros per share for Iberia, which would value the
carrier at around 3.8 billion euros.


"We don't comment on rumours," she said.


Iberia, which operates lucrative routes to Latin America, has
reportedly sparked interest from other European airlines.


Earlier Spanish business newspaper El Economista reported that
Iberia executives had met with Air France-KLM to sound out its
interest for the carrier but Air France was "cold" on the idea.


Iberia said it was not aware of any meeting between its
executives and Air France-KLM.


British Airways, which holds 10 percent of Iberia, has also been
cited by press reports as being interested in the Spanish
carrier.
