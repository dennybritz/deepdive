Spain's benchmark stock market index, the Ibex 35, crossed 15,000
points for the first time on Tuesday buoyed by takeover
speculation and gains by US stocks.


The index closed up 0.2 percent at 15,005.5 points, easing from
an earlier high of 15,022 points, on turnover of on turnover of
5.0 billion euros (6.7 billion US dollars). It has gained some
six percent so far this year.


Spanish construction firm Sacyr led gains, closing up 6.29
percent at 45.10 euros as speculation over its plans for its 33
percent stake in French builder Eiffage continued, dealers said.


Iberia rose 1.2 percent to close at 4.08 euros after Spanish news
agency Efe reported Germany's Lufthansa was preparing to offer
4.0 euros per share for the Spanish airline. The agency cited an
unnamed Iberia stockholder.


The Ibex 35 rose over 30 percent in 2006, making the Spanish
bourse one of Europe's best performers that year.


It has outperformed the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index, a
benchmark index for nations using the euro single currency,
during five of the past six years.


Spanish stocks have benefited from robust economic growth, low
interest rates and a surge in merger and acquisition activity,
dealers and analysts say.
