An Italian television channel on Tuesday aired footage of the
beheading of a driver of an Italian journalist, who was held for
about two weeks by Afghanistan's Taliban militants until Kabul
negotiated his release.


The RAI-1 channel beamed images of Italian journalist Daniele
Mastrogiacomo, his driver Sayed Agha and his interpreter Ajmal
Naqshbandi, kneeling blindfolded before some gun-wielding
militants.


It then showed Agha being beheaded following which a shaken
Mastrogiacomo made an impassioned appeal to Italian authorities
to "do something," while underlining that the situation was "very
difficult."


The Taliban members have also beheaded Mastrogiacomo's
interpreter, who was also a journalist.


The Italian journalist was freed on March 19 after Afghan
President Hamid Karzai ordered the release of five Taliban
prisoners under a controversial deal.


Kidnapping has increasingly become a tactic of the Taliban, who
have been waging a guerrilla-style insurgency since they were
ousted from power in late 2001 by US-led forces.
