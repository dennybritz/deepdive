Britons are travelling overseas more than they ever have before,
and a record number of people are visiting the country from
abroad, a government report released on Wednesday showed.


According to the report from the Office for National Statistics
(ONS), Britons took 66.4 million trips abroad in 2005, the latest
year for which figures are available, more than three times as
many as they took in 1981.


Meanwhile, 30 million people visited Britain from overseas in the
same year, also a record high.


Plane travel was the dominant way Britons chose to leave the
country, with 81 percent flying out, up from 60 percent in 1981,
while those travelling by sea fell to 12 percent, from 41
percent.


The ONS Social Trends report listed mainland Spain and the Canary
Islands as the most popular destination for Britons travelling
abroad, followed by the United States and Ireland in second and
third respectively.
