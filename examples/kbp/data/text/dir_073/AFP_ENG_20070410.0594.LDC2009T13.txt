The Chicago Blackhawks won the National Hockey League draft
lottery on Tuesday, gaining the first overall selection in June's
draft.


Based on the inverse order of regular-season finish, the
Blackhawks had the fifth-greatest percentage (8.1) of picking
first.


Under the lottery system, only the five teams with the fewest
points had the chance to win the first overall selection. No team
could move up more than four spots and no team could move
backward more than one.


But the Blackhawks won the lottery and will have the top pick


for the first time in club history.


"We're obviously very excited about winning the lottery,"
Blackhawks general manager Dale Tallon said. "It's a great
opportunity for us to continue to turn things around. This is a
great break for our organization. It allows us to keep adding
pieces to the puzzle."


The Philadelphia Flyers, who had the greatest chance to win the


lottery, will have to settle for picking second.


The third pick went to the Phoenix Coyotes, who are followed by
the Los Angeles Kings and Washington Capitals.


The 2007 draft, which will be hosted by the Blue Jackets at
Nationwide Arena, takes place over a two-day period, with the
first-round selections being made on June 22 and the subsequent
six rounds being held the following day.
