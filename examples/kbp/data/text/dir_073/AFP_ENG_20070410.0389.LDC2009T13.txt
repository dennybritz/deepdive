Henry Kissinger and three other former US secretaries of state
have endorsed Republican Senator John McCain in his bid for the
presidency, his campaign team said on Tuesday.


"The world's challenges are radically changing and our country
needs John McCain's experience and optimism," said Kissinger,
former national security adviser and secretary of state under
presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.


"His record, character, and belief that America's best days lie
ahead make John McCain the right leader for these times," said
Kissinger in a statement cited by McCain's campaign team.


McCain has also won support from Alexander Haig and George
Shultz, who served as secretaries of state under former president
Ronald Reagan, and Lawrence Eagleburger, who was secretary of
state under ex-president George H.W. Bush, father of the current
president.


Once considered the favorite on the Republican side in the 2008
US presidential race, McCain has been lagging in opinion polls
and fundraising.


McCain is an outspoken supporter of the unpopular war Iraq but
Kissinger and Eagleburger have said in recent months that a
military victory appears out of reach.


Eagleburger participated in the blue-ribbon Iraq Study Group that
called for withdrawing most combat troops from Iraq by early
2008.
