Wall Street shares ended slightly higher Tuesday as the first
quarter earnings season began, with investors cautious ahead of a
flurry of reports from corporate America.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up a modest 4.71 points
(0.04 percent) at 12,573.85 just after the closing bell, while
the Nasdaq composite finished 8.43 points (0.34 percent) higher
at 2,477.61.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index ended up 3.77
points (0.26 percent) at a preliminary close of 1,448.38.


Traders said stock market investors would likely remain cautious
until they gain a clearer picture of the latest corporate
performances.


On the stock front, global banking giant Citigroup gained
attention amid media reports suggesting it is on the verge of
announcing a major overhaul of its operations that will see over
26,000 jobs eliminated or reassigned.
