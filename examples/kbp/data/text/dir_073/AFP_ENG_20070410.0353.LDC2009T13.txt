Gunmen hijacked an Indian diplomatic vehicle near Sri Lanka's
only international airport together with a locally employed
driver, police said Tuesday.


The vehicle with diplomatic plates was on its way to the
Bandaranaike international airport when it was waylaid by gunmen
on Monday night, police said.


They said President Mahinda Rajapakse had ordered a high-level
probe and the case was handed over to the Criminal Investigation
Department. No arrests had been made, police said


The driver of the van, a Sri Lankan national, reported that
gunmen stopped him and took the vehicle away to a location just
north of the airport, but he managed to escape.


The car of an Indian diplomat was stolen in August 2005, and
later found abandoned.
