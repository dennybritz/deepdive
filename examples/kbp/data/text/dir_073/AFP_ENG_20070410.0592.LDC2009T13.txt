English Premiership side Fulham sacked their manager Chris
Coleman, and his assistant Steve Kean, and have replaced him with
Northern Ireland's manager on an interim basis, the club said
late on Tuesday.


Fulham lost 3-1 to visitors Manchester City at Craven Cottage on
Monday, their fifth defeat in a winless eight-match streak that
left them four points above the relegation zone with five matches
left to play.


Coleman and the Cottagers were booed as the players trudged off.


"Chris Coleman has provided a fantastic service during his 10
years at the club and it is disappointing that the club has no
alternative but to part company," a statement on the club's
website read.


"As a team and organisation, Fulham Football Club has goals to
attain and success to achieve and by no means can this be
compromised."


Coleman will be replaced by Lawrie Sanchez on a caretaker basis
until the end of the season.


Fulham visit Reading on Sunday, and must also face Champions
League spot chasers Arsenal and Liverpool in their remaining five
games.


The club is currently in 15th place in the Premiership on 35
points.
