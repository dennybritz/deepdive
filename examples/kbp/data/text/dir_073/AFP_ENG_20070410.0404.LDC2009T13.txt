Bulgaria's former star striker Hristo Stoichkov has resigned as
national team coach, the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) announced
Tuesday.


Stoichkov and the team's chief manager Dimitar Dimitrov handed in
their resignations to BFU chairman Borislav Mihailov and a
statement posted on BFU's official website said both resignations
have been accepted.


Stoichkov, who took over as coach of the Bulgarian national team
in July 2004, said his resignation was due to increasing negative
attitudes towards him during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.


Bulgaria currently stands third in the Euro 2008 Group G, two
points behind Romania and five behind group leaders the
Netherlands.


But following a bitter goalless home draw against outsiders
Albania on March 28 the Bulgarian press lashed out at Stoichkov.
