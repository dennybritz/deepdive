Iran said on Tuesday it will release a documentary on the arrest
and interrogation of 15 British naval personnel, who have
retracted "confessions" about trespassing into Iranian waters.


"A documented report on the arrest, interrogation and the
statements of British sailors during detention is being prepared
and will soon be released as CDs and books," a chief of staff
spokesman, Alireza Afshar, told ISNA news agency.


"Forcing the British sailors to deny their previous statements
was a third victory for Iran," he said of the troops' insistence
on being in Iraqi waters when seized on March 23 after their
aired apologies for entering Iranian waters.


The first two "victories" have been described as their seizure
and then their unexpected pardon and release by Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.


Describing the troops' press conference after arriving home as a
"childish show on Britain's part", Afshar said it "shows the
aggressive nature of the British and their irreverence towards
international law".


Several of the group said on their return to Britain last week
that they had been maltreated and subjected to psychological
pressure during their detention.


The sole female British sailor among them, Faye Turney has said
her captors stripped her to her underwear, lied to her and
threatened she might never see her baby again.


Britain's defence secretary has barred the troops from selling
their stories to the media.


Afshar said it was a "huge scandal for the British army to allow
the personnel to sell their memoirs".
