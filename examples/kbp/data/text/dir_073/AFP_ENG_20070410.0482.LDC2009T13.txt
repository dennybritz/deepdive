South African fly-half Steve Meyer faces six months on the
sidelines after tearing his cruciate knee ligament, his club
doctors at Perpignan said Tuesday.


The 23-year-old underwent an MRI scan which confirmed he had torn
his knee ligament in Saturday's 20-3 victory over Albi.


Meyer only joined the French Top 14 outfit in August 2006 from
Natal Sharks in his homeland.


French centre David Marty was also injured during the same game,
suffering an ankle sprain but should only be out for a week or
so.
