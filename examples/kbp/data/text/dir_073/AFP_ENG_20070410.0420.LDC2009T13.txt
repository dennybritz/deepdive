Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht on Tuesday arrived in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, his country's former star African
colony, for a first-hand assessment following fresh unrest in
Kinshasa.


De Gucht is due to meet with representatives of the international
community, as well as President Joseph Kabila and his arch-rival,
former vice president Jean- Pierre Bemba, whose body guards
clashed with the army late last month, leaving more than 200
people dead.


Bemba, a failed presidential candidate and former rebel leader,
has been holed up in the South African embassy since the March 22
and 23 clashes -- the latest spurt of violence to rock the
restive mineral-rich nation.


De Gucht leaves the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday for
Angola before proceeding on to Zambia, Rwanda and Burundi.
