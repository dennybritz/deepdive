Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht on Tuesday called for a
swift reform of the Democratic Republic of Congo's armed forces
to avert a repeat of clashes that shook the capital last month.


De Gucht arrived in DR Congo, a former Belgian colony, earlier in
the day for a first-hand assessment of the aftermath of the
unrest in Kinshasa.


"The first lesson to draw from the fighting is a better and
swifter process of national disarmament, demobilisation and
reintegration into society" of all combatants of the various
warring factions, he said during a function at the Belgian
ambassador's residence.


"It is unacceptable that members of the opposition have a
militia," he added. The monopoly of power lay with the government
and legitimate authorities elected last year, he said.


Fighting between government forces and the militia loyal to
former vice- president Jean-Pierre Bemba's militia late last
month left more than 200 people dead.


De Gucht also called for closer cooperation between the West and
DR Congo authorities after a chill following the 2006 elections.


He was to meet with representatives of the international
community, as well as President Joseph Kabila and his arch-rival
Bemba.


Bemba, a failed presidential candidate and former rebel leader,
has been holed up in the South African embassy since the March 22
and 23 clashes -- the latest spurt of violence to rock the
restive mineral-rich nation.


De Gucht leaves the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday for
Angola before proceeding to Zambia, Rwanda and Burundi.
