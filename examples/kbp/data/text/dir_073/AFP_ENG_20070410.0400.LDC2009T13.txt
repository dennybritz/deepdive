The US State Department said authorities in Macau had unblocked
North Korean bank accounts on Tuesday, removing a major hurdle to
implementation of a landmark agreement to end the communist
regime's nuclear weapons program.


State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Washington now
expected North Korea to follow through with its pledge to shut
down and seal its Yongbyong nuclear reactor by a Saturday
deadline.


"The ball is in their court on the matter," McCormack said.


North Korea has refused to shut the reactor until it receives 25
million dollars in funds that had been frozen in the Banco Delta
Asia bank in Macau as a result of US sanctions.


Washington lifted its objections to releasing the funds last
month, but the money remained blocked due to what US and Chinese
officials described as technical problems.


McCormack said Tuesday that Macau monetary authorities had agreed
to open the accounts to their owners.


"The bottom line is they have unblocked these accounts and
authorized account holders can withdraw the funds from those
accounts," he said, citing an apparent announcement by a Macau
monetary policy spokeswoman.


"The issue has been resolved, I think in the view of all the
parties in the six- party talks, and we'll see if the North
Koreans share that view," he said, referring to the parties to
North Korean disarmament negotiations -- China, Japan, North
Korea, South Korea, Russia and the United States.
