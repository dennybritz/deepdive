India on Tuesday blocked a complaint at the World Trade
Organisation by the European Union over Indian import duties on
wines and spirits.


India rejected the EU's demand that the WTO set up a special
panel to rule on the dispute, in accordance with its rights under
WTO procedures, and said the initiative was premature because of
discussions currently underway.


The EU is expected to renew its request at the next meeting of
the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body on April 24, when India will
not be able to block it again, a source close to the WTO said.


The EU said it regretted that bilateral talks had failed to
resolve the dispute.


The United States submitted a similar complaint to the WTO over
India's wine and spirit duties in early March.


Indian Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said last month that his
country remained committed to resolving the dispute through
negotiations.


"We recognise that tariffs are high. We are in talks with the
EU... they are at an advanced stage. I believe this situation
will be corrected," he said.


Combined duties and taxes are as high as 550 percent on imported
spirits and as much as 264 percent on imported wine, according to
an EU report.


EU statistics agency Eurostat said that in 2004, EU wine and
spirits exports to India amounted to just 27.3 million euros
(36.7 million dollars), out of a total EU export market worth 9.5
billion euros.
