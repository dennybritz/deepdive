The number of visitors to Greece's famed museums and
archeological wonders increased year-on-year in 2006, augmenting
revenues by nearly seven percent, the national statistical office
said Tuesday.


Some 2.7 million visitors flocked to museums -- a 3.8-percent
rise over 2005 -- while about 7.5 million went to archeological
sites dotting the islands, a nine percent increase over the
previous year.


Revenues rose 6.9 percent to 48 million euros (64 million
dollars) in 2006, it said.


Greece, home to one of the world's oldest and best known
civilisations, boasts wonders such as the Acropolis in Athens --
the most frequented historical site in the country.
