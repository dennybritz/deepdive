Survivors of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre on Tuesday appealed to
Bosnian authorities to make the anniversary of the atrocity a
national day of remembrance.


A group representing Srebrenica survivors and victims' family
members forwarded the request to Bosnia's central government and
parliament, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported.


Bosnian Serb forces and irregular Serb police units killed some
8,000 Muslim men and boys over several days in July 1995 after
they overran Srebrenica, which was then a UN-protected enclave.


The massacre is the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.


Its alleged masterminds -- wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his former army chief Ratko Mladic -- are still at
large more than 11 years since being indicted by the UN war
crimes tribunal.


The two face charges of genocide for atrocities committed during
Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, notably in connection with the Srebrenica
massacre and siege of Sarajevo that claimed around 10,000 lives.


The remains of some 600 newly identified Srebrenica victims are
to be buried on the 12th anniversary of the massacre on July 11
this year.


The victims were identified after being exhumed from more than 60
mass graves uncovered since the end of the war.
