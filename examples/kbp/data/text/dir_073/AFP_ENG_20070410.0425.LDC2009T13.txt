Twelve Arab foreign ministers will gather in Cairo on April 18 to
discuss a Saudi-drafted plan for peace with Israel, Arab League
Secretary General Amr Mussa said on Tuesday.


"The foreign ministers of the Arab peace initiative commission's
member countries will meet on April 18 in Cairo to examine
proposals aimed at activating the initiative," he said.


Mussa was speaking to reporters after a meeting with top
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat.


The 12-member Arab commission consists of Algeria, Bahrain,
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen.


At a summit in Riyadh last month, Arab leaders revived a five-
year-old peace plan that offers Israel normal relations if it
withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 Middle East war, and
allows for the creation of a Palestinian state and the return of
Palestinian refugees.


Israel rejected the plan when it was first adopted in 2002, but
has since said that it could serve as a basis for talks provided
there are changes on the refugee issue, something Arab heads of
state rejected at the Riyadh summit.


Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit, who also met Erakat
Tuesday in Cairo, urged Israel to respond positively to the peace
plan put forward at the Riyadh summit.


"Israel should deal with the Arab peace initiative positively and
recognise it as the basis for peace negotiations," he said.
