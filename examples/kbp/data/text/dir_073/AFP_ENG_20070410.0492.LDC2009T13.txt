Tennessee Titans cornerback Adam Jones, implicated in a shooting
in Las Vegas earlier this year, has been banned for the entire
2007/08 season without pay by the NFL on Tuesday for engaging in
conduct detrimental to the league on numerous occasions.


The PacMan, as Jones is known, has been involved in 10 different
incidents and arrested five times since entering the NFL in 2005.


Last month, Las Vegas police recommended prosecutors file charges
against Jones, stemming from a February 19 shooting at a strip
club which left one victim with a severed spinal cord.


He is considered a rising star of the Titans team but has become
the first victim of an NFL crack-down on player behaviour off the
field.


The NFL also announced that Cincinnati Bengals' Chris Henry has
been banned for the first eight matches of next season.


Both players will also have to show exemplary behaviour before
being allowed back into the NFL.


Jones was suspended for one game by Titans coach Jeff Fisher last
season for a "series of off-the-field incidents."


However, the Bengals have been the worst hit by player
misbehaviour, with nine players arrested on a variety of charges
ranging from drunk driving to weapons violations. Henry stands
out on the Bengals with four arrests in the last three years.


"We must protect the integrity of the NFL," NFL Commissioner
Roger Goodell said in a statement Tuesday.


"The highest standards of conduct must be met by everyone in the
NFL because it is a privilege to represent the NFL, not a right.
These players, and all members of our league, have to make the
right choices and decisions in their conduct on a consistent
basis."
