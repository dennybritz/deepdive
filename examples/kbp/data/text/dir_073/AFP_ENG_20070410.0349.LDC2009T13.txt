An earthquake measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale shook western
Greece early Tuesday but there were no reports of casualties or
major damage.


The first quake hit at 6:17 am (03h17 GMT) followed by a series
of others with the same magnitude, the Athens Observatory's
Geodynamic Institute said, adding that the tremors rocked the
towns of Messologui, Agrinio and Thermo.


The high school in the town of Thermo, home to some 3,500 people,
was damaged, a police source said, adding that engineers in the
districts of Aitoloakarnania and Athens were checking buildings
which had developed cracks.


A seismologist from the Athens Observatory's Geodynamic
Institute, Georges Drakatos, told the public television channel
Net that there had been "peculiar seismic activity" in the
region, something seismologists were following closely.


Another seismologist from the same institute played down fears
that aftershocks could wreak havoc.


"It's normal to have a series of aftershocks and this is going to
continue for at least another 48 hours, but for the present we
are not unduly worried," Fanis Halaris told AFP.


Greece is the European country most at risk from earthquakes,
suffering about half of all the quakes registered on the
continent.
