Ivan Pudar on Tuesday signed a two-year deal to coach Croatian
first division side Hajduk Split.


The 45-year-old, who arrives from first division Sibenik,
replaces Zoran Vulic who quit Monday following a series of poor
results.


Pudar was Hajduk goalkeeper from 1979-1990.


He becomes the club's 11th coach in seven years.


Currently second in the league, Hajduk have since the country's
independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 won six first
division and four Cup titles.
