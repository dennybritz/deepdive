American world number three Andy Roddick has pulled out of the
Houston ATP event, organisers said Tuesday.


The top seed was due to begin his challenge Tuesday but decided
he was still suffering from a muscular problem in his backside
that forced him to pull out of his quarter-final clash against
Britain's Andy Murray in Miami last month.


Roddick did, however, play in the United States' Davis Cup clash
against Spain at the weekend, beating Fernando Verdasco 7-6, 6-1,
6-4.


The 24-year-old has been replaced by Austria's lucky loser
Alexander Peya for the clay court event.
