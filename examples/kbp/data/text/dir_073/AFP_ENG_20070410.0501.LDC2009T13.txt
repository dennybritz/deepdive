Spain's late dictator Francisco Franco fathered an illegitimate
son with the wife of a lieutenant in 1936 when he was the
military commander of the Canary Islands, according to a new book
which will be published next week.


Franco, who ruled Spain with an iron fist from 1939 until his
death in 1975, never recognized this son, Spanish author Fernando
Gracia writes in his new book called "The Secret Son of Franco",
the Europa Press agency reported Tuesday.


The son was born just before Franco took part in 1936 in a failed
coup attempt against a left-wing government that ushered in the
Spanish Civil War, the book says, according to the agency.


Born in 1892, Franco -- who staunchly supported the Roman
Catholic Church while in power -- married Carmen Polo in 1923.
The couple had one daughter, Maria, who was born three years
later and died in 1988.


The book also says Franco had a bastard half-brother who was
fathered by his father Nicolas Franco, a Navy paymaster, and a 14
-year-old Filipina.
