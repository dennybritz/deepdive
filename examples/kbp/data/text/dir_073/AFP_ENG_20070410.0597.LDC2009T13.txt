All Nippon Airways Co. group, Japan's second-largest airline,
said some 15 percent of its domestic flights were likely to be
cancelled after crew members went on strike Wednesday.


Negotiations over labour conditions with four unions of some 540
ANA crew members broke down early Wednesday, it said in a
statement.


The strike was likely to lead to the cancellation of 136 domestic
flights, or about 15 percent of ANA's total domestic flights
Wednesday, affecting about 6,500 passengers, it said.


It would also cause delays to 42 domestic flights, affecting
about 2,200 passengers, it said.


International flights were expected to operate as usual, ANA
said.
