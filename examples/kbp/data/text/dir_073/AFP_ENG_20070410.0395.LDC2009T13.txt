An Italian football fan has been hospitalised after being stabbed
in the leg before Tuesday night's Serie B match between league
leaders Juventus and rivals Napoli.


The attack followed clashes between rival supporters outside the
Olympic Stadium ahead of the afternoon kick-off.


The man was rushed to hospital but was not reported to be
seriously injured, according to the Ansa news agency.


The Italian government last week passed new laws they hope will
stamp out football hooliganism.


Strict new security measures were introduced shortly after a
policeman was killed when Catania fans went on the rampage
before, during and after their Serie A derby match against
Sicilian rivals Palermo in February.


The government clampdown demanded clubs took more responsibilty
for security, including more closed-circuit television (CCTV)
cameras at stadiums, named tickets, electronic turnstiles,
adequate stewarding, and crowd filtering areas outside grounds.


Juventus were last summer demoted from Serie A and given a nine-
point handicap in Serie B for their role in the Italian match-
fixing scandal.
