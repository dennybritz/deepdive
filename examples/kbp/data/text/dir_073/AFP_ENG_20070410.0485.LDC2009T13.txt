Portugal's president officially signed into law legislation
decriminalising abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy, his
office announced Tuesday.


It was the final step in a legislative process started after a
February 11 referendum supported the proposal by 59 percent; and
the socialist-controlled parliament approved reform on March 8,
the International Women's Day.


Portugal's centre-right President Anibal Cavaco Silva said he
regretted that there had not been a clearer majority backing the
changes.


He called on parliament to ensure that the different interests of
all those involved were taken into account, and for a check on
how the law was working after a reasonable period of time.


The referendum result had not been legally binding because less
than half of those eligible to vote took part in it. But
socialist prime minister Jose Socrates pressed ahead, arguing
that the outcome clearly favoured reform.


Socialist, communist, green, far-left deputies -- and some
centre-right social democrats -- carried last month's
parliamentary vote. Most right-wing deputies opposed the change,
calling on the president to veto it.


Until now, the abortion law in this predominantly Catholic
country was one of the most restrictive in Europe.


Under the old law, an abortion was allowed only in cases of rape,
a malformed foetus or if the woman's well-being was in danger.


According to a study published in December by Portugal's family
planning association, 18,000 women had illegal "back-street"
abortions in 2005.
