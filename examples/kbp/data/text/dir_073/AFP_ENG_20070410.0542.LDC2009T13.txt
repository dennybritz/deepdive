The online satellite imaging site Google Earth announced Tuesday
it was adding features that will allow users to zoom in on the
crisis in Sudan's strife-torn Darfur region.


The project was spearheaded by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum
and showcases 1,600 villages affected by the conflict, including
photographs, data and eyewitness testimony.


Computer users can download the free Google Earth application
online, then using the mouse "fly" over Africa to zoom in on the
"Crisis in Darfur" section from a skyview perspective.


Destroyed houses, homes, mosques and schools are visible along
with links to data, eyewitness testimony, factboxes, pictures and
maps that are updated regularly.


Four years of civil war in Darfur have killed at least 200,000
people and displaced more than two million, according to United
Nations figures.


"The only way to stop the killing in Darfur is by informing
people," said Dawud Salih, a Darfur resident, refugee and former
Red Cross officer. "People must know what genocide looks like."


Google representative Elliot Schrage said the service will allow
"users to visualize and learn about the destruction in Darfur as
never before," and added that "technology can be a catalyst for
education and action."


The Holocaust Museum is currently developing similar projects to
educate about other world atrocities, under its "genocide
prevention mapping initiative."
