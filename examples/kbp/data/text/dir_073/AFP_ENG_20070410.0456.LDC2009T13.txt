A man hijacked a Turkish airliner carrying 180 passengers and
crew on Tuesday but gave himself up to authorities after it
landed in Ankara, television channels reported.


"The hijacker, of Turkish nationality, has given himself up to
police and been taken into custody," transport ministry spokesman
Ibrahim Sahin told journalists at Ankara.


The hijacker's name was Mehmet Gokcingol and he was aged about
40, he added. "All the passengers and crew are safe and sound."


The passengers would be continuing their journey on another
plane, said Sahin.


One passenger told CNN-Turk television that the hijacker had said
he had a bomb attached to his belt and that at one point he had
read verses from the Koran.


"He didn't seem to be in full possession of his mental
faculties," the passenger added.


Television news reports had said the man had wanted the plane to
go to Iran.


The Pegasus airline Boeing 737-800 carrying 174 passengers and
six crew had taken off from the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir
in southeast Turkey for Istanbul at 5:40 pm (1440 GMT).
