President George W. Bush has signed a new law setting out aid to
help former Soviet bloc countries join NATO, the White House said
Tuesday.


The new law "reaffirms support for continued enlargement of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)," a statement said.


It particularly names Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia, and
Ukraine as eligible for such assistance under a 1994 law which
stipulates countries must meet NATO requirements before becoming
members.


Under the new law, funds will be released in the 2008 budget to
provide military assistance to these countries to prepare for
eventual membership.


The 26-member organization has signalled that is due to invite
Albania, Croatia and Macedonia to join the alliance at its next
summit in 2008.


But Russia has strongly objected to proposals that its neighbors
Ukraine and Georgia could also be invited to join the alliance.
