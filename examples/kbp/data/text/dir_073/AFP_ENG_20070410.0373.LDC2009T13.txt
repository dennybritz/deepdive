The German presidency of the EU said Tuesday Iran's claim to be
producing enriched uranium on an industrial scale was a "direct
contradiction" of two binding UN Security Council resolutions.


"Such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated
requests by the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of
governors and of the binding demands of the UN Security Council's
resolutions 1737 and 1747 on Iran to cease all enrichment
activities," it said.


Berlin said it had learnt of Iran's claim with "great concern"
and urged Tehran to return to the negotiating table to resolve
the dispute about its nuclear programme.


"The presidency of the EU once again urges Iran to comply with
the demands of the international community and to create the
conditions for a return to the negotiating table and for a
solution to the conflict surrounding the Iranian nuclear
programme."


Iran said this week that it is now able to enrich uranium on an
"industrial scale" and plans to ramp up its controversial atomic
drive significantly.


Diplomats based in Tehran on Tuesday pointed to confusion over
exactly how many uranium-enriching centrifuges it had installed.


Russia said it sees no sign that Iran has made any breakthrough
in its nuclear fuel enrichment programme.
