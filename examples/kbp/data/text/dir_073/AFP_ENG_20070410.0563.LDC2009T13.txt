Austria's airforce chief has been suspended over irregularities
in a 2003 contract to buy 18 Eurofighters planes, Austria's
Defence Minister Norbert Darabos announced Tuesday.


General Erich Wolf had not managed to clear up the suspicions
that a lobbyist for the plane's constructor EADS had paid 87,000
euros (117,000 dollars) to a company owned by Wolf's wife when
the contract was being negotiated.


Darabos made the announcement after a private meeting Tuesday
with Wolf, 58, before the defence ministry's disciplinary
committee.


A parliamentary commission launched by the Social Democrats, the
environmental Green party and part of the far-right, has been
examining the deal since last October.


The contract was signed with EADS in 2003 by then Austrian
chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.


His successor, Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer, said Monday that the
recent revelations were "to be taken very seriously" and made it
more likely that Austria would pull out of or amend the contract.


Gusenbauer, a Social Democrat, made a campaign pledge to scrap
the Eurofighter contract worth some two billion euros before his
election on October 1.


The left in Austria believe that the purchase of the planes was
extravagent for a small, neutral state.
