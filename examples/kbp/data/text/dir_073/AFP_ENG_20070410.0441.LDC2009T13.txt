A man hijacked a Turkish airliner carrying 180 passengers and
crew on Tuesday but gave himself up to authorities after it
landed in Ankara, television channels reported.


Anti-terrorist police took the man away from the jet at Ankara
airport, the Anatolia news agency said.


News reports said the man had wanted the plane to go to Iran.


The Pegasus airline Boeing 737-800 carrying 174 passengers and
six crew was flying between Istanbul and the mainly Kurdish city
of Diyarbakir in southeast Turkey when it was taken over, the
reports said.


The hijacker was a Turk named Mehmet Gokcingol aged about 40, a
transport ministry official, Ibrahim Sahin, was quoted as saying
by Turkish media.
