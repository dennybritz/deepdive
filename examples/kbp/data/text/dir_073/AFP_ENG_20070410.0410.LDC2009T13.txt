Gunmen killed an African peacekeeper and wounded two others in an
attack on Tuesday in Sudan's troubled western region of Darfur,
the African Union said in a statement.


The African Mission in Sudan described the attack, which took
place near Sortony in North Darfur state, as "barbaric".


"Investigations into this incident will be carried out to
determine the circumstances under which this attack happened and
to identify the assailants and their motives," it added.


The embattled contingent suffered its worst ever losses on April
1, when five AU troops were killed in northwest Darfur, near the
Chadian border.


The latest attack brings to 16 the number of African peacekeepers
killed in Darfur since the 7,000-strong contingent started being
deployed there in 2004.
