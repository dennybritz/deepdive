A senior White House official on Tuesday admitted he was floored
by the news that Singapore's prime minister earned five times
more than US President George W. Bush.


"I'm going to emigrate and run for office in Singapore," the
official said on condition he be identified only as "a senior
administration official who sits in disbelief after reading that
story."


On Monday, the Singapore government had announced a fresh 25.5
percent pay hike for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, boosting his
salary to 2.05 million dollars per year.


Bush gets paid 400,000 dollars per year for doing his job,
according to the White House.


Combined with personal investment income, he and his wife Laura
reported 618,694 dollars in taxable income in the 2005 fiscal
year. They had to pay 187,768 dollars in federal taxes.


But maybe Bush shouldn't feel so bad. The Singaporean's paycheck
is eight times fatter than Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's.
