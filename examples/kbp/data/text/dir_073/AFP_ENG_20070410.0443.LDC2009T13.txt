The African Union on Tuesday readmitted Mauritania to the pan-
African organisation from which it was suspended after a coup in
2005, an AU spokesman told AFP.


"Mauritania is readmitted to the AU with full rights," said
Assane Ba at AU headquarters.


The decision came less than two weeks after Mauritania's
constitutional council officially confirmed Sidi Ould Cheikh
Abdallahi as the country's first democratically elected president
since independence.


Ould Abdallahi is a 69-year-old former political prisoner and ex-
government minister who won 52.85 percent of the votes in a
second round presidential run- off against Ahmed Ould Daddah last
month.


Ba said that observers had judged the election "free and
transparent".


The AU's Peace and Security Council lifted sanctions imposed on
Mauritania after the August 4, 2005 coup and welcomed the members
of the country's military council for having stood by their
pledge of democractic rule, he added.
