US President George W. Bush on Tuesday invited Congressional
leaders from both parties to discuss the contentious issue of
funding for the unpopular war in Iraq.


"When it comes to funding our troops, we have no time to waste,
it's time for them to get the job done, and so I am inviting
Congressional leaders from both parties, both political parties,
to meet with me at the White House next week," Bush said.


He was speaking during a visit to war veterans in Fairfax,
Virginia, close to Washington.


"At this meeting, the leaders in Congress can report on progress
on getting an emergency spending bill to my desk," he added.


"We can discuss the way forward on a bill that is a clean bill, a
bill that funds our troops, without an artificial timetable for
withdrawal and without handcuffing our generals on the ground."


Democrats, which control both houses of Congress, are trying to
impose a deadline on US troops in Iraq by tying military funding
to a withdrawal in 2008.


The House and Senate, which have passed bills with different
deadlines, must iron out the differences between their bills and
send one to president for his signature to become law.


Bush has repeatedly said he will veto any bill that sets a firm
date for pulling US troops out of the violence-wracked country.


His invitation for talks was not an invitation for negotiations,
stressed White House spokeswoman Dana Perino.


"The president has said very clearly what he will sign which is a
bill that funds the troops, that doesn't tie the hands of the
commanders, that does not include an arbitrary timetable for
withdrawal," she said.
