Princess Maxima, the Argentinian-born wife of Prince Willem
Alexander, the heir to the Dutch throne, on Tuesday gave birth to
the couple's third child, another daughter, the royal press
service said.


The baby is "in perfect health," the press service statement
quoted the prince as saying.


The as yet unnamed girl will be fourth in line to the Dutch
throne after her father, and her sisters Catharina-Amalia and
Alexia.


The new princess' name will be revealed when Willem Alexander
officially reports the birth to the registry office in the coming
days.
