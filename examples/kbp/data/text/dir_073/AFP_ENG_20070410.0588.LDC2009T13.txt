The United Nations is considering proposing a "high-level
meeting" in September to give political direction to a later
conference on climate change, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
said in an interview published Wednesday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, the UN chief said that the
meeting, which would not be at summit-level, would allow
countries to decide what level delegates they should send.


Ban told the business daily that the most "practical and
realistic approach" involved ministers and other senior delegates
at the UN General Assembly in a meeting that "may be able to give
some clear guidelines to the December Bali meeting."


Signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, which gives targets for
countries to reduce their carbon emissions, are meeting in Bali,
Indonesia in December.


Ban's spokesman has said that the UN chief hoped that the
signatories would make progress towards developing a replacement
to the accord, which expires in 2012.


He told the FT that "a summit level meeting will have to be
discussed later on," assuming the Bali conference is successful.


"It may be 2008 or 2009."


Defending his reasoning for not calling for a summit-level
conference, Ban told the paper: "One difficulty is whether I can
see for sure the participation of all the major countries,
including the United States."


He said that after a conference in June of the Group of Eight
industrialised nations, "I may be in a clearer position to
propose a certain initiative."
