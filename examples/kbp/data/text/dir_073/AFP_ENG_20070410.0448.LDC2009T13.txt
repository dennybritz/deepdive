Construction of the second stage of the Siberia-Pacific pipeline,
which will carry Siberian oil to Asia, could be delayed by up to
four years, an official with the Russian natural resources
ministry said Tuesday.


"At the moment, because of a delay in the growth of (oil)
reserves, the start of construction on the second part of the
pipeline could be pushed back by three to four years in the best
of circumstances," Sergei Fedorov, head of the ministry's
oilfield explotation department, said in a report carried by the
Ria Novosti news agency.


The line will carry Russian oil to the Asia-Pacific region, and
Japan in particular. China has also been pressing Moscow to
approve a branch that would supply the Chinese market.


The 2,000-kilometer (1,250-mile) first stage linking Irkutsk in
southern Siberia with the Amur region near the Chinese border is
expected to be operational next year and capable of carrying
around 30 million tonnes of oil a year. Construction began 12
months ago.


The second stage will connect the Amur region and the Pacific
coast.


With the completion of the second phase of the project, the
pipeline will reach a length of 4,000 kilometers and will be able
to carry up to 80 million tonnes of Siberian oil a year.
