One man was killed and nine people were injured in a grenade
attack Tuesday in Indian Kashmir, police said.


Officers said unidentified rebels hurled a hand grenade at a
security post in the Batamaloo district of Indian Kashmir's
summer capital Srinagar.


It missed the intended target and exploded on a crowded road, a
police spokesman said, adding one office worker was killed and
nine others hurt.


The 17-year-old Islamic insurgency has so far left 44,000 people
dead.
