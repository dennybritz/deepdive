World tennis number one Roger Federer on Tuesday became the first
living Swiss person to have his picture enshrined on a postage
stamp.


"It's a great moment. I'm proud to be a symbol like the army
knife or the mountains," Federer said at an unveiling ceremony
for the Swiss postal service in the 25-year-old's home region of
Basel.


The new 1.00 Swiss franc (0.61 euros, 0.82 dollars) stamp depicts
a smiling Federer holding his trophy at Wimbledon after one of
four victories there.


Switzerland, an Alpine federal republic which only has a
ceremonial presidency that changes every year and no royal
family, has traditionally shunned personalities on its postage
stamps except historical figures.


"If you can come up with any Swiss personality who can equal
Roger Federer's prestige, in any domain, I'm ready to follow
you," said Swiss Post's chief executive Ulrich Gygi.


Federer, who has won ten Grand Slams among his 47 singles titles
since turning pro in 1998, has suffered premature exits from two
events since the postage stamp was announced late February,
ending a 41-match winning streak.
