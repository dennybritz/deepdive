World Cup discard Mal Loye has told England's misfiring frontline
batsmen that they need to hit form against Bangladesh on
Wednesday or face the risk of elimination.


Loye, who played in England's successful one-day series in
Australia in the run- up to the World Cup, believes problems at
the top of the order have damaged the Caribbean campaign.


With England to face South Africa and the West Indies after
Wednesday's game in Barbados, Loye says Michael Vaughan's team
cannot continue to rely on Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell.


"They are going to fail," Loye told Sky Sports News of the free-
scoring Pietersen and Bell.


"One of them is going to fail in the next three games so of the
rest, someone has to stick their hand up and score the runs as
well.


"The changes have been made and they will stick with Andrew
Strauss (who replaced Ed Joyce) for the rest of the tournament
and they have just got to come good."


Skipper Vaughan is having a miserable tournament making just 12
runs in his last four innings.


"Hopefully that will be the captain because there is nothing
worse than a captain in the side who is struggling," Loye added.


"At the moment he is putting a brave face on the whole thing but
it will have an effect on him. I think he will come good. He is
just out of form and when a batsman is out of form he cannot get
his feet moving."


"They have got to win their last three games, it is as simple as
that. The South Africa game is crucial but we have got to start
on Wednesday against Bangladesh."
