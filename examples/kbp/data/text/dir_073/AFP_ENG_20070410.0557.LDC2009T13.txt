Argentine football hero Diego Maradona will soon be released from
a clinic where he has been treated for alcohol intoxication for
the last 13 days, the facility's director said Tuesday.


Hector Pezzella, director of the Guemes clinic in Buenos Aires,
said Maradona could be cleared to leave "in the next hours due to
the general state" of his health as he recovers from hepatitis
caused by excessive drinking.


The clinic was to release an update on the 46-year-old's health
later Tuesday.


But the former Barcelona and Napoli star faces a long road to
full recovery, his personal doctor said.


"We cannot give him a full clean bill of health, because that is
far down the road," his personal doctor, Alfredo Cahe, told
reporters.


It is not the first time the former Argentina captain, who led
his squad to the 1986 World Cup title, has been hospitalized due
to his excessive lifestyle.


In 2000, Maradona had a heart attack in Uruguay following a
cocaine overdose.


Four years later, another heart attack followed another overdose.


After growing overweight, he underwent gastric bypass surgery in
2005 to reduce the amount of food he consumes.
