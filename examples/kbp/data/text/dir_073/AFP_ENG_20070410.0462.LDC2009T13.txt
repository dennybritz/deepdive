Leicester prop Marcos Ayerza will miss the European Cup semi-
final against Llanelli after being banned for three weeks on
Tuesday by the event's organisers for striking an opponent.


The 24-year-old Argentinian international was cited for striking
flanker Remy Martin during the 21-20 win over French side Stade
Francais on April 1.


"The independent Disciplinary Committee found Mr Ayerza guilty of
striking Stade Francais Paris back row forward Remy Martin and
the Committee suspended the player for a period of three weeks up
to and including 30 April, 2007," European Cup organisers, the
ERC, said in a statement.


The 11-times capped Ayerza will now miss the Energy Cup final
against the Ospreys on Sunday as well as the European Cup semi-
final with Welsh outfit Llanelli on April 21.


Ayerza, who has the right to appeal, had already been banned for
eight days by the Leicester on April 7 after club officials
reviewed the incident at Welford Road.
