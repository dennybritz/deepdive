Kidnappers released on Tuesday a Japanese woman abducted nine
days ago with her boss, the head of Sun Myung Moon's Unification
Church in Paraguay, who is still being held, police said.


The release of secretary Sawako Takayama serves as the "proof of
life" demanded before friends would pay a 500,000-dollar ransom
which the kidnappers set for Hirokazu Ota, the head of the church
here, said deputy interior minister Mario Sapriza.
