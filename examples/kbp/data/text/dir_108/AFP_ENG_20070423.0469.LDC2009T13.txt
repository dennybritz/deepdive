George Clooney could star and direct in a movie adaptation of
critically acclaimed political documentary "Our Brand Is Crisis,"
Variety reported on Monday.


Studio giants Warner Bros. have acquired the remake rights to the
2006 film, which chronicled the involvement of Washington
political consultancy Greenberg Quinlan Rosner in the Bolivian
elections of 2002.


The US company helped secure a narrow election victory for
Bolivia's former president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, but he
resigned little more than a year later amid spiralling civil
unrest.


Entertainment journal Variety reported that the movie version
would reimagine the documentary -- about the perils of exporting
American-style democracy -- as a black comedy.
