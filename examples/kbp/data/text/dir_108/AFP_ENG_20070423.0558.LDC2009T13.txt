Nigerian president elect Umaru Yar'Adua on Monday appealed for
national unity amid widespread protests over an election slammed
as flawed both at home and abroad.


"The contest has come and gone. So must our differences, in the
interest of the greater good," Yar'Adua, of the ruling People's
Democratic Party (PDP), said in his first press briefing since
being declared the winner of Saturday's election.


"I have extended my friendship to all my colleagues who contested
in the elections. I want all Nigerians to join hands together
with the PDP to work and move this country ahead forming a
government of national unity," he said.


Yar'Adua, governor of the northern state of Katsina, expressed
his will to "cut above all barriers - ethnic, political,
religious and gender."


He rejected widespread accusations that the poll was rigged,
saying that was "a sweeping conclusion based on fallacy" and
arguing that "other people believe this is one of the best
elections the country has experienced."


Accusations of fraud came both from the opposition and from
international observers.


Minutes after Yar'Adua was proclaimed the winner Monday the
United States said it was "deeply troubled" by violence and
voting irregularities.
