A 12 year-old Palestinian boy was shot dead in the northern Gaza
Strip late on Monday, medical sources said.


Mohammad al Saadi was hit in the street by a bullet fired by
unknown assailants who then fled, the sources said.


In a separate incident three Palestinian children were slightly
injured in the Shaati refugee camp in a grenade explosion at the
home of a militant from the Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's
military wing, security sources said.
