An Italian tribunal on Monday ruled that Italy should return to
Libya the Venus of Cyrene, a headless marble statue found by
Italian archeologists in the north African country in 1913.


In 2002, Rome signed an agreement authorising the transfer of the
second-century statue to Libya, which was an Italian colony from
1911 to 1942.     But conservation group Italia Nostra objected
and appealed to the administrative tribunal in Latium, near Rome,
to keep it in Italy.


On Monday, the tribunal said the Venus should be sent back,
ruling that "the place where she was found was at the time part
of Libyan territory" and saying that she "in no way could be
catalogued as a discovery on Italian soil".


The statue, which has been on show at Rome's Palazzo Massimo
museum, was named by the Italian archaeologists after a
neighbouring port.
