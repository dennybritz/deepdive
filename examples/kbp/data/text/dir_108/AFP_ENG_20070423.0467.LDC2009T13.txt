A British soldier was killed Monday when his patrol came under
attack in the Al Ashar district of the southern Iraqi city of
Basra, the defence ministry in London said.


"The soldier was providing top cover protection for a Warrior
armoured vehicle on a routine patrol when he was killed by small
arms fire," the ministry said in a statement.


"He was evacuated to (the British base at) Basra Palace, but
tragically died of his injuries. No other soldiers were hurt in
the incident."


The soldier, whose identity has not been released but whose
family has been informed, was from the 2nd Battalion The Duke of
Lancaster's Regiment.


On April 19, two British soldiers were killed and three others
injured, one of them seriously, in a roadside bomb attack in
Maysan Province.


A total of 145 British troops have now died in Iraq since the US-
led invasion in March 2003, according to defence ministry
figures.
