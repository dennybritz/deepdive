Francesco Guidolin was sacked as coach of Serie A highflyers
Palermo on Monday after failing to win their last 11 matches
which has seen them slip down the table.


The end for the 52-year-old came at the weekend when Palermo lost
4-3 to relegation-threatened Parma and left them in sixth place
and in danger of missing out on European football next season.


Guidolin, formerly with French championship side Monaco, has been
replaced by his assistant Renzo Gobbo and reserve team coach
Rosario Pergolizzi.


Palermo have slipped alarmingly in recent weeks having led Serie
A in the autumn, their winless streak - seven draws and four
defeats - dates back to February 2, when they beat Sicilian
rivals Catania 2-1.
