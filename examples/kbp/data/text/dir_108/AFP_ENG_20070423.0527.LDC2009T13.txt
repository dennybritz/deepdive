The new US ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad,
takes over his duties Monday, US spokesman Richard Grenell said.


"Ambassador Khalilzad was saying today that his priorities ...
for the first couple of months are obviously Iran, Lebanon, Syria
and UN reform," said Grenell, spokesman for the US mission at the
United Nations.


Grenell also said "a very big priority for him is to get the
United Nations more involved," in Iraq.


UN operations in Iraq have been reduced since a truck bomb hit
its offices in Baghdad in August 2003, killing 22 people,
including special representative of the secretary general, Sergio
Vieira de Mello.


Khalilzad replaces the controversial John Bolton, who left office
in December after President George W. Bush's foes in the US
Senate refused to confirm his nomination.


Noting Bolton's confrontational style, South African ambassador
Dumisani Kumalo said of Khalilzad, "the good news is he can't be
as bad as John Bolton."
