Younis Khan has pulled out of the Pakistan squad to play a three-
match series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi in May saying he is
still suffering from the team's traumatic World Cup.


Younis, the Pakistan vice-captain, said he wants to concentrate
on his career with English county Yorkshire but insists he is
still available for future Pakistan series.


"I still love my country and do not see this decision as me
turning my back on it. I will play for Pakistan again and play
with pride, but now is not the right time," Younis said in a
statement.


"The last few weeks have been a very difficult time for me. The
tragic death of Bob Woolmer remains deeply upsetting. Pakistan's
World Cup exit and the nature of the reception I received when I
returned to Pakistan was also very tough to deal with."


Since the World Cup debacle, which saw Woolmer murdered in his
Jamaica hotel room and Pakistan make a first round exit, Younis
has turned down the opportunity to succeed Inzamam-ul-Haq as
skipper.


Shoaib Malik has been appointed as the new national team captain
instead.


"It is great to be able to concentrate on cricket. It is
important to me to maintain my fitness and form while playing for
my county," said Younis who hit a winning century for Yorkshire
against Nottinghamshire in a one-day game on Sunday.


"The team has had a terrific start to the season and the players
and club have made me feel at home. I will stay here and do my
best for my new teammates."
