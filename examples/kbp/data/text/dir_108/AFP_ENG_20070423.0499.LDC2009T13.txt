Nigeria's presidential election was a disgrace to the country,
one of the two opposition candidates, General Muhammadu Buhari,
said Monday.


The election, criticised from all sides for fraud, was won by the
ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Umaru Yar'Adua.


"I completely and utterly reject the results as a sham," Buhari
said in a statement.


"It was a disgrace to Nigeria, a shame on the electoral
commission and a great dishonour to the PDP government," he
continued.


Buhari, a former military ruler, said the elections were "neither
free, nor fair nor credible".


"In a nutshell, there were no elections worthy of that name on
Saturday in Nigeria," he concluded.
