Abortion is akin to "terrorism with a human face," a top Vatican
official said on Monday.


Italian bishop Angelo Amato, responsible for Church doctrine,
said that along with suicide bombers, "there also exists
'terrorism with a human face' which is just as repugnant" and
which is masked by misleading expressions.


"For example abortion today is called 'involuntary interruption
of pregnancy' and not the murder of a defenceless human being ...
and euthanasia is referred to 'death with dignity'," Amato said
during a seminar on terrorism.


The bishop also hit out at "parliaments of countries calling
themselves civilised which pass laws contrary to human nature"
such as "same-sex marriages and euthanasia."
