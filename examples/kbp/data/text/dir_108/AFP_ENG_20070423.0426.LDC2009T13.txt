Sir Alex Ferguson refused to get involved in a war of words with
Premiership title rival Jose Mourinho after the Chelsea manager
suggested referees are reluctant to award visiting teams
penalties at Old Trafford.


Mourinho made the comment after United defender John O'Shea's
challenge on Dong- Gook Lee went unpunished in Saturday's 1-1
draw with Middlesbrough at Old Trafford.


Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate admitted afterwards he
thought his team should have been awarded the spot-kick when Lee
was brought down.


But Ferguson, speaking ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semi
final with AC Milan at Old Trafford, said he had viewed the
incident again on video and insisted that referee Peter Walton
got it right.


"I've looked at Saturday's incident and John O'Shea got the
ball," said Ferguson.


United lead Chelsea by three points with four games remaining in
the Premiership.


The title could be decided when United, who have a superior goal
difference over their London rivals, travel to Stamford Bridge to
face Chelsea on May 9.


Despite Mourinho's remarks, four penalties have been awarded to
opposition teams at Old Trafford this season which have resulted
in three goals.
