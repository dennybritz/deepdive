US President George W. Bush on Monday reaffirmed his confidence
in embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after widely
panned congressional testimony last week.


"The attorney general went up and gave a very candid assessment
and answered every question he could possibly answer, honestly
answer. And in a way that increased my confidence in his ability
to do the job," Bush said.


Prominent Democrats and even some of the president's Republican
allies have called for the resignation of Gonzales, who has been
embroiled in a controversy over a mass firing of federal
prosecutors in late 2006.


"As the investigation or the hearings went forward, it was clear
that the attorney general broke no law, did no wrongdoing," Bush
told reporters.


"And some senators didn't like his explanation, but he answered
as honestly as he could. And this is an honest, honorable man in
whom I have confidence," said the president.


Critics have charged that the eight US attorneys were dumped for
political, rather than judicial, reasons.


In his testimony last week, Gonzales drew fire from Democrats and
Republicans for repeatedly insisting that he could not recall his
role in key parts of the decision to remove the prosecutors.
