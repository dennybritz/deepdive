Police in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed one of three
men dressed as members of the presidential guard who attacked an
opposition deputy at his home, politicians said Monday.


"Three men dressed in the uniform of the presidential guard tried
to get into the home of Jacques Ebwene, firing shots in the air,"
Charles Bofassa Djema, president of the Order Republican
Democrats (ODR), told AFP.


The incident happened on Sunday.


It was not yet clear whether or not the dead man was a genuine
member of the presidential guard, said Djema.


Opposition deputies quit their seats in the national assembly
earlier this month calling for guarantees for their safety after
government forces staged a series of what they felt were heavy-
handed raids at politicians' homes.


They have drawn up a list of their demands for President Joseph
Kabila.


The DR Congo government ended its occupation of opposition leader
Jean-Pierre Bemba's Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) party
headquarters only last Saturday.


They were ransacked by the military after clashes with Bemba's on
March 22 and 23. Radio and television stations owned by Bemba
were also looted.
