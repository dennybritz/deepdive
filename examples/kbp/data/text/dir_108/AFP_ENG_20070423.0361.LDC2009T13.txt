Global mining giant Anglo American said Monday that it would buy
almost half of the Minas Rio iron ore project in Brazil for 1.15
billion dollars (848 million euros).


The Minas Rio project, which is currently under development and
expected to start production in the final quarter of 2009, is
operated by Brazilian mining company MMX.


Anglo American said it would buy a 49-percent share from MMX and
Centennial Asset Mining Fund, which is controlled by MMX chief
executive Eike Batista.


Anglo American planned to increase its holding to 50 percent.


"Iron ore is core to Anglo American's future growth strategy,"
said Anglo American chief executive Cynthia Carroll in a
statement announcing the news.


She added: "We are pleased to have taken this important step in
securing this partnership with MMX to develop such an exciting
iron ore project in Brazil, a country where we have long-standing
experience and which is a major iron ore producing region of the
world."
