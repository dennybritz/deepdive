Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on Monday condemned
what he termed Washington's "support for terrorism in various
parts of the world," at the start of a two-day Cuba visit aimed
at strengthening bilateral trade ties.


The Iranian diplomat's remarks came in reaction to Washington's
decision last week to free former CIA operative Luis Posada
Carriles, wanted by Cuba and Venezuela for the deadly downing in
1973 of a Cuban passenger jet, claiming 73 lives.


"We condemn the release of Luis Posada Carriles," Mottaki said
upon his arrival.


Posada paid 350,000 dollars to be released, pending his May 11
trial in the United States for immigration fraud and other
charges, on condition that he remain confined to his Miami home
and submit to "electronic monitoring."


Mouttaki's trip to Cuba comes on the heels of his visit Venezuela
for talks on improving bilateral relations.


Venezuela, Iran and Cuba all are among the most virulent critics
of the administration of US President George W. Bush.
