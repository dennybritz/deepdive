Poland's economy grew by nearly seven percent in the first half
of the year, the economy ministry said Monday.


"Industrial production figures for the first half suggest that
growth was near the seven-percent level," the ministry said in a
statement.


"The economy is in a renewed growth phase and we expect the
positive trends to continue through the coming months, exerting
limited pressure on inflation," the statement said.


Also Monday, the National Statistics Bureau (GUS) revised upward
to 6.1 percent its forecast for gross domestic product growth for
2006. An earlier forecast by GUS had predicted growth of 5.8
percent for last year.


The official rate of growth of GDP for the first half will be
published by GUS at the end of next month.


In 2005, Poland's GDP grew by 3.6 percent.
