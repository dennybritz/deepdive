A Dutch court Monday ordered the defence ministry to allow a
survivor of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre access to its
confidential files on the episode, the ANP news agency reported.


The widow of Bosnian Muslim Rizo Mustafic, who worked as an
electrician for the Dutch peacekeepers assigned to protect the
Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia, had asked the court to be
allowed to see the confidential documents.


In July 1995 after Bosnian Serb forces overran the enclave the
Dutch peacekeepers who evacuated from Srebrenica refused to take
Mustafic with them. He died together with nearly 8,000 Muslim men
and boys who were summarily executed by the Bosnian Serbs.


His widow, now resident in the Netherlands, has launched a legal
claim against the Dutch government and her lawyers have demanded
access to documents on the fall of Srebrenica classified by the
defence ministry as confidential.


The Srebrenica massacre is the only episode in the bloody 1992-95
war that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY) has ruled was an act of genocide.


In 2001 the Dutch cabinet resigned after an enquiry said that it
had sent soldiers to carry out "mission impossible" at
Srebrenica.


The government has refused to apologise, however, saying the
troops were under UN command and that Bosnian Serbs were
responsible for the killings.


The Netherlands never officially apologized to the survivors of
the massacre or the families of the victims arguing that the
Dutch peacekeepers operated under UN command.
