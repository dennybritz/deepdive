A suicide car bomber attacked a popular restaurant in the violent
city of Ramadi in western Iraq on Monday, causing several
casualties, officials and a local leader said.


Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf, director of the interior
ministry operations centre in Baghdad, said the assault was
launched at 5:45 pm (1445 GMT) and caused several casualties,
although he could not give figures.


Karim Burisha, nephew of the leader of a local coalition of Sunni
tribes fighting Al-Qaeda, told AFP that another bomb had been
made safe nearby by US troops before the suicide bomber hit the
crowded eatery.


An Iraqi defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the death toll could be as high as 20, but both Burisha and
Khalaf insisted that the true casualty count would likely be
lower.


Iraqi and US forces are still battling an anti-American
insurgency in the town four years after the March 2003 invasion
of the country.
