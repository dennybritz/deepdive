Americans now favor gun control only slightly more than they did
before last week's university shooting, according to an opinion
poll published Monday.


The Pew Research Center found that six out of 10 respondents
considered the control of gun ownership to be a priority, while
32 percent said it was more important to protect people's right
to own a gun.


The results showed little change from a similar survey in 2004,
in which 58 percent said gun control was more important than gun
owners' rights.


And while 47 percent of people in 2000 favored a total ban on the
sale of handguns, that figure had now fallen to 37 percent, with
57 percent opposed, according to the research organization.


The telephone poll was conducted among just over 1,500 adults
between last Wednesday -- two days after a gunman went on the
rampage at Virginia Tech university, killing 32 people before
shooting himself -- and Sunday.


As to the causes of the shooting, some 47 percent said such mass
killings were isolated acts while 46 percent said they reflected
broader problems in American society.
