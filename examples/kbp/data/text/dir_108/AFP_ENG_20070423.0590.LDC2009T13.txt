A Senegalese deputy called Monday for a parliamentary inquiry
after a youth died in weekend clashes between police and locals
in the southern city of Kolda.


"As a deputy, I put down a motion with the president of the
National Assembly calling for a parliamentary inquiry to be set
up following the death of Dioutala Mana," Amadou Ndiaye Lo told
AFP.


Lo, who also serves as deputy mayor of the city, said that Mane
was shot dead. The police offered no comment Monday.


Violence brok out Saturday at the funeral of another youth, 23
-year-old Dominique Lopy, who had died in police custody the
previous weekend.


Lopy had been picked up on suspicion of stealing from an
official, but several residents told AFP they blamed Lopy's death
on injuries he had suffered while in custody.


"Two deaths in the space of a week, that's unacceptable," said
Lo, who also condemned Lopy's death.


Lopy's family meanwhile said that they would be taking legal
action against the authorities, both against the police for his
death and against the official who had accused him of theft.
