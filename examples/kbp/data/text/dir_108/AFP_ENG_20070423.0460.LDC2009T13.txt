A Lebanese soldier was shot dead on Monday at the entrance to the
Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon, a
military source said.


Three people, two Lebanese and a Palestinian, were detained by
the army, the source added.


The clash took place after an argument at the army checkpoint
outside the camp between the family of a sick Lebanese woman
whose parents were trying to take her to hospital and soldiers
posted there.
