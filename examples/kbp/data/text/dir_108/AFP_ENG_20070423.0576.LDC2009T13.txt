Backing for Britain's governing Labour Party has fallen to its
lowest level in nearly a quarter-century, a poll set to be
published in Tuesday's edition of The Independent newspaper
showed.


According to the CommunicateResearch survey, support for Labour
is at 27 percent, down four percentage points compared to a
similar survey a month ago, while the main opposition
Conservatives gained one point to 36 percent.


The smaller opposition Liberal Democrats gained two points to 22
percent.


Labour's poll rating is its lowest since 1983.


The poll comes about 10 days before crucial elections for various
local councils across England, as well as regional assemblies in
Scotland and Wales, where Labour is expected to fare poorly.


Prime Minister Tony Blair is widely expected to step down in the
aftermath of those polls, and finance minister Gordon Brown is
his likely successor.


CommunicateResearch questioned 1,000 adults by telephone between
April 20 and 22.
