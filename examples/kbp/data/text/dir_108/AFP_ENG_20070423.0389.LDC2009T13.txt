Boris Berezovsky, the exiled Russian billionaire who made his
fortune under Boris Yeltsin, said the former president was the
country's "greatest reformer" after hearing of his death Monday.


"It's really, really terrible. I just want to say that the guy
was my mentor and Russia has lost its greatest reformer," he told
AFP by telephone.


"He helped millions and millions of Russians become free,
including me. He helped me to understand freedom compared to
slavery. Today I am in London and I have never, ever doubted my
choice in favour of freedom.


"He was definitely unique, a man at the top of Russia's history."


Berezovsky was close to Yeltsin and made his money during
privatisation following the fall of communism.


The entrepreneur fled to Britain in 2000 and was granted
political asylum in 2003. Critical of current President Vladimir
Putin's government, he has since successfully fought off
extradition requests from Moscow.


Yeltsin's former advisor, Alexander Nekrasov, said: "I think he
will always be remembered as the man who brought down communism."


The White House coup in Moscow in 1991 strengthened his position
and sounded the death knell for one-party rule.


"That's what his legacy is," Nekrasov told Britain's Sky News
television.


Things went "seriously wrong" for Yeltsin after his election win
in 1996, he told the broadcaster.


"People were using his position to gain enormous wealth. Yeltsin
was sometimes weak and ill, well, let's face it he was drinking a
lot.


"That was the time he should probably have stepped down. But
vested interests around him didn't want him to leave. There was a
lot of money at stake."
