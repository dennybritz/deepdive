Delta Air Lines said Monday it trimmed its losses for the first
quarter as the number three US carrier prepared to emerge from
bankruptcy protection.


Delta posted a loss of 130 million dollars in the January-March
quarter, compared with a whopping 2.1 billion dollar loss in the
same period a year earlier.


For all of 2006, Delta lost some 6.2 billion dollars as it took
hefty charges to reorganize by cutting jobs and operating costs.


The first quarter also included restructuring costs of 124
million dollars. Without this, the company's overall loss would
have been only six million dollars.


Revenues meanwhile increased 11.4 percent from a year earlier to
4.14 billion dollars for the quarter.


"The past 18 months have been challenging times and Delta people
rose to that challenge," chief executive Gerald Grinstein said.


"As these results show, much more has been done than improving
our financial structure. Delta has fundamentally transformed into
a thriving industry leader. We are stronger -- financially,
operationally, and in spirit -- and Delta is ready to return to
its traditional leadership position in this highly competitive
industry."


At the end of March, Delta had some four billion dollars in cash
and equivalents. Its creditors have approved its plan to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and a judge is set to review the plan
for final approval by April 30.


Delta rejected a takeover bid from US Airways last year,
preferring to continue as a stand-alone company.
