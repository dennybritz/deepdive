A Russian hunter has shot and killed a rare Amur leopard in the
far-east of the country, one of only around 30 left in the wild,
the World Wide Fund For Nature said on Monday.


The hunter shot the female in the back in mid-April and finished
it off by hitting it repeatedly over the head with a heavy
object, WWF said in a statement.


The incident occurred in the Barsovy national park near the
Chinese border, and was the third such incident in the area in
the past five years, WWF far-east coordinator Sergei Khokhriakov
said.


According to the latest report from Russian and US researchers,
there are between 25 and 34 of these animals living in three
nature reserves along the Amur river.


Poachers can sell a dead Amur leopard for up to 50,000 dollars
(37,000 dollars). If caught, they risk a fine of just 20,000
rubles (800 dollars), according to Russia's ecological watchdog
Rosprirodnadzor.
