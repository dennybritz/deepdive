Spanish restaurants took top billing in a list of the 50 best
eateries in the world published on Monday, with three in the top
10, but France was better represented in the entire list.


Restaurant magazine's list included a dozen in France, followed
by eight from the United States, seven from Britain and six from
Spain and Italy each, selected by 651 voting panel members
reviewing restaurants in 70 different countries.


Topping the list was El Bulli in Barcelona, headed by Ferran
Adria, named the best chef in the world by the New York Times,
followed by The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, to the west of
London.


Third was Pierre Gagnaire in Paris, followed by French Laundry in
Yountville, California, and Tetsuya in Sydney in fourth and fifth
respectively.


Just one Asian restaurant made the top 50 -- Indian eatery
Bukhara in Delhi was named the world's best Asian restaurant --
despite the fact that Asia had twice as many eligible voters as
last year.


Noma, in Copenhagen, climbed the most spots from last year's
list, coming in at 15th in 2007, up 18 spots compared to 2006. By
contrast, British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's restaurant,
named after himself, dropped ten places to 24th.


Paris meanwhile was the best city for food enthusiasts, with nine
restaurants in the top 50, followed by London with six.
