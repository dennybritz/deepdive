The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index's record-
breaking streak of last week was put on pause Monday as investors
awaited fresh economic news in coming days, traders said.


US stocks were bolstered, however, by Bank of America's
announcement that it was bidding 21 billion dollars to take over
LaSalle Bank Corporation, but stocks slipped from a record
closing high struck Friday.


The benchmark Dow index finished down 41.69 points (0.32 percent)
at 12,920.29, after closing at an all-time high of 12,961.98 on
Friday, marking its third straight record closing high.


The Dow moved closer to the level of 13,000 points earlier in the
session but then retreated.


The tech-rich Nasdaq composite ended down 2.72 points (0.11
percent) at 2,523.67 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's
lost 3.28 points (0.22) percent to a preliminary close of
1,481.07.


Bank of America has agreed to buy LaSalle Bank from Dutch banking
giant ABN Amro as part of a related, but separate, larger deal by
Britain's Barclays bank to takeover ABN Amro.


In other merger news, US biotechnology company MedImmune was also
in focus after Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca
said it has agreed to buy the US firm for 15.6 billion dollars.
