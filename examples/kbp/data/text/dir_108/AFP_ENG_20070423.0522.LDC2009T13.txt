A Lebanese soldier was shot dead on Monday at the entrance to the
Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon, a
military source said.


Three people, two Lebanese and a Palestinian, were detained by
the army, the source added.


The clash took place after an argument at the army checkpoint
outside the camp between the family of a sick Lebanese woman
whose parents were trying to take her to hospital and soldiers
posted there.


According to the "popular committee" of Palestinian organisations
in Nahr al- Bared, the camp's dispensary was unable to treat the
woman and her family then decided to take her to an outside
hospital.


It said the family had been held up by searches at the
checkpoint, and that she was dead on arrival at the hospital.


Believing the delay had led to her death, relatives of the woman
returned to the checkpoint and opened fire, killing soldier Rabih
Mustapha, the "popular committee" said, adding there was no
political motive behind the incident.


Tensions have run high at the camp since the arrival of an
Islamist Palestinian group called Fatah al-Islam, accused by the
government of being behind a bus bombing in a Christian area in
February that killed three people.


Last month a member of Fatah al-Islam was killed and another
member of the group wounded in an exchange of fire at the camp
during which two members of the mainstream Palestinian movement
Fatah and a passerby were also wounded.
