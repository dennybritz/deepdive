Francesco Guidolin was sacked as coach of Serie A highflyers
Palermo on Monday after failing to win their last 11 matches
which has seen them slip down the table.


The end for the 52-year-old came at the weekend when Palermo lost
4-3 to relegation-threatened Parma and left them in sixth place
and in danger of missing out on European football next season.


Guidolin, who had already had a spell with Palermo from January
2005 to the end of the 2005-06 season when he quit over
differences of opinion with club president Maurizio Zamparini,
has been replaced by his assistant Renzo Gobbo and reserve team
coach Rosario Pergolizzi.


Palermo have slipped alarmingly in recent weeks having led Serie
A in the autumn, their winless streak - seven draws and four
defeats - dates back to February 2, when they beat Sicilian
rivals Catania 2-1.


"This measure has been taken to save our season," said Zamparini.


"It was necessary to give them (the club) a jolt," added
Zamparini, who after the Parma match had given free rein to his
feelings declaring that 'Guidolin had a good team and he broke
it'.


Guidolin, who is the 12th coach to be sacked in Serie A this
term, enjoyed a good first spell with Palermo gaining them
promotion from Serie B and qualifying them for the UEFA Cup
before quitting and taking charge of Genoa briefly and then for a
season at French side Monaco.
