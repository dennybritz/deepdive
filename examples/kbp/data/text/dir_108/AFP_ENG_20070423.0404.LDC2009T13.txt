British Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed former Russian president
Boris Yeltsin, who died Monday, as a "remarkable" man who had
played a vital role at a crucial time in his country's history.


"It is with sadness that I learned of the death of former
president Yeltsin," Blair said in a statement issued by his
office.


"He was a remarkable man who saw the need for democracy and
economic reform and in defending that reform he played a vital
role at a crucial time in Russia's history."
