Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed his predecessor Boris
Yeltsin, who died Monday, as the man who gave birth to "a newly
democratic Russia".


Yeltsin would always be remembered as the first president of the
post-Soviet Russian Federation, Putin said.


Under Yeltsin "a newly democratic Russia was born, and a free
nation opened to the world," he added.
