Iberdrola, Spain's second-biggest electricity provider, said
Monday its 17.1 -billion-euro (22.8-billion-dollar) takeover bid
for British group Scottish Power has cleared the final regulatory
hurdle.


The bid was approved by Scotland's supreme civil court, the Court
of Session, in Edinburgh, the company said in a statement.


Following the ruling Iberdrola said it had acquired the "totality
of Scottish Power's ordinary shares."


Scottish Power is the fifth-biggest gas provider in Britain with
nine percent of the market, and the sixth-biggest electricity
provider with 13 percent.


A tie-up with Iberdrola, amid consolidation in the European
energy sector, would create Europe's third-biggest utility group
and would see Spain finally creating a so-called utility
champion.
