Embattled US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on Monday vowed he
would stay on the job as long as he can lead the department.


"I will stay as long as I believe I can be effective," he added.


"As long as I think that I can be effective and the president
believes that I should continue to be at the head of the
Department of Justice, I'll continue serving," he told reporters.


House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other
politicians, including members of President George W. Bush's
Republican Party, have called for Gonzales to resign over the
controversial dismissal of eight top prosecutors.


"I can't be focused only on the US attorneys situation," he said.


"I am focused on making sure our kids are safe, making sure our
neighborhoods are safe, making sure our consumers are safe," said
Gonzales at a Federal Trade Commission press conference on
identity theft.


Gonzales spoke just hours after Bush reaffirmed his confidence in
his attorney general.


Critics have charged that the eight US attorneys were fired for
political, rather than judicial, reasons.
