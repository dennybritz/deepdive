A Cuban dissident considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty
International has been sentenced to 12 years in prison in a
secret trial in Havana, an opposition group said on Monday.


Lawyer Jimenez Posada, 36, who has been in detention since March
2003, was tried on charges of revealing "secrets relating to the
security of state" and of showing contempt for President Fidel
Castro, the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National
Reconciliation (CCDHRN.)


"He was not allowed to conduct his own defense as a lawyer and he
was tried in his absence for protesting before the court," said
CCDHRN, a dissident movement that is officially illegal but is
tolerated by Cuba's communist authorities.


The group said Posada, 36, was sentenced during a secret trial
held earlier this month.


"The commission is very concerned, because in less than a month
there have been two summary, secret trials against dissidents,
without the presence of lawyers or relatives," CCDHRN said in a
statement.


At the beginning of the month, journalist Oscar Sanchez Madan, 44
was sentenced to four years in jail, on vague charges that
indicate possible intent to commit a crime.


Cuban authorities holds a total of 270 political prisoners, 76 of
whom are listed by Amnesty International as "prisoners of
conscience."
