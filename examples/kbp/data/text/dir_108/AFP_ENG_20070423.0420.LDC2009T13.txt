US President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin
on Monday discussed the US plan for a missile defense shield in
Europe and the future of Kosovo, the White House said.


"They discussed areas of mutual interest, including missile
defense and Kosovo," as well as US Defense Secretary Robert
Gates's trip to Moscow, said national security spokesman Gordon
Johndroe.


The two leaders spoke before news that former Russian president
Boris Yelstin had died.


Johndroe's comments came as Russia rebuffed Gates in his attempt
to soften opposition to Washington's plan for a missile defence
shield in Europe, saying it threatens global security.


Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov told Gates in Moscow that the
planned system "is a seriously destabilizing factor that can have
a significant influence on regional and global security."


Gates, who also met with President Vladimir Putin, came to Moscow
reiterating Pentagon reassurances that the anti-missile shield
would not be aimed at Russia and also holding out offers of
cooperation.
