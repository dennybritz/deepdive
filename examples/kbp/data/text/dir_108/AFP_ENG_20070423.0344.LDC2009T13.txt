The White House on Monday declined comment on the French
presidential elections, firmly brushing aside questions about
whether it had a favorite in the second- round run-off set for
May 6.


"I'm not going to touch that with a 20-foot pole," spokeswoman
Dana Perino replied when asked whether US President George W.
Bush would rather see Nicolas Sarkozy or Segolene Royal succeed
French President Jacques Chirac.


"We'll let the French, in two weeks, make their decision," she
said.


Sarkozy won 31.18 percent of Sunday's vote ahead of Royal on
25.97 percent, according to final official figures. Turnout was a
near-record 83.77 percent.


US officials have said privately that they don't want to be drawn
into the race to decide who will take over from Chirac, whom Bush
has praised publicly over Franco-US cooperation on Lebanon after
clashing over the war in Iraq.
