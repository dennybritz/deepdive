The Professional Rugby Players Association (PRA) in England have
threatened strike action if an agreement is not reached between
clubs and federations over the proposed boycott of next season's
European Cup.


"If revolution is the only language that people can understand,
then maybe we will have to ballot our members and see if they are
willing to take strike action," said PRA chief executive Damian
Hopley on the group's official website.


"If common sense doesn't prevail, then where else can you turn?
The game is not so much shooting itself in the foot, as blowing
off both feet.


"We have this Jerry Springer-type washing of dirty linen in
public, which does no one any good. And to think that all this
squabbling is taking place against such a thrilling backdrop.


"Leicester win the EDF Energy Cup on Sunday, there (were) three
English sides in the European Cup semi-finals (at the) weekend,
and then we have the most exciting final day of Premiership rugby
we've ever had. The players have certainly kept their side of the
deal."


English and French clubs have pulled out of next season's
European Cup because of disputes of fixture congestion and the
amount of control clubs have over the competition.
