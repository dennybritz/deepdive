Britain and the World Bank announced aid grants Monday worth more
than 436 million dollars to the Democratic Republic of Congo.


But Britain's development minister warned that London would be
following developments in the country closely.


The World Bank said it was paying 296.7 million dollars (219
million euros) towards restoring the country's main hydroelectric
dams and getting the national electricity grid back in service.


The grant will be paid out over a three-year period.


Britain's international development minister Hilary Benn
announced a grant of 140 million dollars this year towards
various projects designed to improve conditions for the general
population.


"That will support health and education and water and sanitation
and roads, supporting good governance and security sector
reform," said Benn.


"But in my discussions with President Kabila and Prime Minister
Gizenga, I made clear that we will judge progress in the DRC by
events," he added.


"Only with peace and democratic progress will the international
community really be able to help development in the DRC."
