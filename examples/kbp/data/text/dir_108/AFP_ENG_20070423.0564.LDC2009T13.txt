A Cuban dissident considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty
International has been sentenced to 12 years in prison in a
secret trial in Havana, an opposition group said on Monday.


Lawyer Rolando Jimenez Posada, 36, detained since March 2003, was
tried on charges of revealing "secrets relating to the security
of state" and of disrespecting the figure of President Fidel
Castro, said the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National
Reconciliation (CCDHRN).


"He was not allowed to conduct his own defense as a lawyer and he
was tried in his absence for protesting before the court," said
CCDHRN, a opposition movement that is officially illegal but is
tolerated by Cuba's communist authorities.


The group said Posada, 36, was sentenced during a secret trial
held earlier this month.


"The commission is very concerned, because in less than a month
there have been two summary, secret trials against dissidents,
without the presence of lawyers or relatives," CCDHRN said in a
statement.


It said Jimenez Posada was held in isolation in what is known as
a "punishment cell" at the El Guayabo prison on Cuba's Isle of
Youth.


At the beginning of the month, journalist Oscar Sanchez Madan,
44, was sentenced to four years in jail, on vague charges that
indicate possible intent to commit a crime.


Cuban authorities hold 270 political prisoners, 76 of whom are
listed by Amnesty International as "prisoners of conscience."
