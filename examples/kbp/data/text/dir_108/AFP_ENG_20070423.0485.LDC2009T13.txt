Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl paid tribute to former
Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who died on Monday aged 76, as a
"loyal friend of the German people".


Kohl, 77, who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw German
reunification, described Yeltsin as a personal friend, and said:
"His merits in terms of relations between Germany and Russia and
world peace cannot be over-estimated."


He said Yeltsin had led Russia "with courage, passion and wise
determination."


Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel said of Yeltsin in a
letter of condolence: "His contribution to the development of
relations between our two countries will not be forgotten."


Her predecessor as German leader, Gerhard Schroeder, told n-tv
television: "We have lost a great friend of our country. During
his time in office the political and economic cooperation with
Germany was strengthened."
