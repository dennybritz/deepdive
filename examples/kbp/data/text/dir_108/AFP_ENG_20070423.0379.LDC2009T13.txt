Clashes between Ethiopian troops and Islamist insurgents on
Monday killed at least 37 people and raised the death toll to 256
from six days of fighting, a rights group said.


"Of now we have 18 civilians killed and 21 wounded. We also have
19 opposition (insurgents) dead and 21 wounded," said Sudan Ali
Ahmed, chairman of the Elman Peace and Human Rights Organisation
which monitors casualty rates.


Mutilated bodies lay rotting in the streets under blistering sun
as shooting barred residents from collecting them for burial,
witnesses said.


"We have been asking both sides to stop fighting but our calls
have landed on deaf ears. But we renew our appeal for the sake of
innocent civilians," Ahmed said.


The UN refugee agency said last week that more than 321,000
people had fled the seaside capital since February 1, but elders
told AFP that figure could now be closer to 400,000 with the
exodus of thousands more over the past six days.


Most of them are camped under trees on the city's outskirts
without supplies or protection from reported disease outbreaks.


Prospects for a ceasefire were shattered last week when Ethiopian
forces refused to meet elders from Mogadishu's dominant Hawiye
clan unless insurgent commanders also attended.


Ethiopian troops are helping the weak transitional government
assert some form of control over the city, which was briefly
captured by an Islamist alliance last year.
