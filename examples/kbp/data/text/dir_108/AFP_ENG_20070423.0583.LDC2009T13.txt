The Bolivian government on Monday ordered two private pension
funds to transfer to the state their 47 percent stake in Entel
telephone company, in the latest step in President Evo Morales'
flagship nationalization program.


Authorities were also negotiating for the purchase of the 50
percent stake held by Telecom Italia. The remaining three percent
is held by investors.


Monday's decree ordered the transfer of the 47 percent of shares
from two pension funds administered by Switzerland's Zurich
Financial Services and Spain's BBVA.


Authorities want the state to gain full control of Entel, one of
Bolivia's major companies, with net profits averaging 40 million
dollars a year.


Italian company Stet, which was later taken over by Telecom
Italia, bought its 50 percent stake for 610 million dollars in
1996.


In another key step toward nationalization of key assets and
resources, Bolivia's Congress last week formally approved 44 new
contracts negotiated with 10 foreign oil and natural gas
companies.


The contracts give Bolivia a majority share of the revenues
generated in the energy sector.
