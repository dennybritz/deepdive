NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer sent condolences
Monday to Boris Yeltsin's family, remembering the former Russian
president as the man who led Russia to democracy.


"President Yeltsin will be remembered for his courage in charting
a new, democratic course for his country," Scheffer said in a
statement.


"He was also at the forefront of the effort to overcome the
legacy of the Cold War by forging a new relationship between
Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance.


"This historic effort to set aside the fears and stereotypes of
the past in favour of cooperation in facing the challenges of the
future ... continues to this day," Scheffer said.


Yeltsin, 76 and with a long history of heart disease, died at
3:45 pm (1145 GMT) in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital of
coronary and vascular failure, presidential medical service chief
Sergei Mironov told Interfax news agency.
