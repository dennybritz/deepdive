The World Economic Forum for the Middle East will be held in
Jordan from May 18-20 in the presence of world and Arab
politicians, an official said in Amman on Monday.


Representatives of the G11, grouping 11 developing countries,
will meet on the sidelines of the gathering, Bassem Awadullah,
vice president of the administrative council of the King Abdullah
II Fund for Development, told a news conference.


"The next session of the WEF for the Middle East will be held by
the Dead Sea and will focus on political, cultural and economic
issues," he said, singling out problems affecting young people,
especially unemployment.


The last WEF Middle East gathering was held in Egypt last May,
while Jordan hosted the first three meetings of the "Davos of the
Middle East".


Awadullah said a summit of the Gll -- Croatia, Ecuador, Georgia,
Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, Sri
Lanka and Tunisia -- is planned for May 19 on the sidelines of
the WEF meeting.


"So far nine leaders have confirmed they will attend," he said.


The G11 "are undertaking economic, social and political reforms
to increase their possibilities for growth," Awadullah said.


King Abdullah announced the establishment of the G11 in New York
last September on the sidelines of the United Nations General
Assembly.


The grouping aims to reduce debt owed by member states, alleviate
poverty and raise standards of living.
