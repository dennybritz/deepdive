US President George W. Bush and visiting Peruvian President Alan
Garcia urged the US Congress on Monday to approve a US-Peru free
trade deal that lawmakers in Lima ratified one year ago.


"The president is here to urge the Congress, both Republicans and
Democrats, to pass the free trade agreement with Peru, and I urge
them to vote yes," Bush said during a joint public appearance
with Garcia at the White House.


"For us, it is vital," said Garcia, who boasted of Peru's eight-
percent growth with just one-percent inflation over the past year
and said a repeat performance was possible as long as US
lawmakers approve the free trade pact.


The deal "will help maintain and strengthen a democracy that
helps the poorest and gives jobs to the unemployed and shows the
world that democracy, with a free market and investment, is the
best path to development," said Garcia.


The trade agreement was ratified by Peru's Congress in April
2006, but the US Congress has not yet voted on the treaty.


Bush's Republicans no longer control the US Congress,
complicating passage as Democrats have said they would like to
see labor and environmental protections added to the deal.
