Several hundred youths lit bonfires Monday in the northern
opposition stronghold of Kano to protest the results of Nigeria's
presidential poll, an AFP reporter said.


The election, slammed by foreign and domestic monitors for fraud,
was won by the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate
Umaru Yar'Adua.


The two main opposition candidates running in the race, Vice
President Atiku Abubakar and Muhammadu Buhari, a former military
ruler, have both rejected the results of the poll.


Youths loyal to Buhari staged a protest in Rijiyar Lemo, a poor
district of Kano early Monday evening, forcing motorists to make
a V sign with their fingers in solidarity with their candidate or
have their windscreen smashed.


The youths chanted "Nigeria is for Buhari" and "We hate this
injustice."


Police used teargas and fired into the air to disperse the
protestors, who disappeared into back alleys.


Officers resorted to bags of drinking water in a vain attempt to
extinguish the bonfires.
