An American soldier was killed in Iraq on Monday, taking to 61
the number of US fatalities this month, the US military said in a
statement.


The soldier was killed when an improvised explosive device went
off near his base at Muqdadiyah 100 kilometres (60 miles) north
of Baghdad, it said.


His death brought to 3,321 the number of the American military's
losses in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion, according to an AFP
count based on Pentagon figures.
