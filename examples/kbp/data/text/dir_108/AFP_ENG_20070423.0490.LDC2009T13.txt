US President George W. Bush on Monday mourned former Russia
president Boris Yeltsin as "an historic figure" who helped
democracy take root there and fostered warm ties with the United
States.


"Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of former Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. President Yeltsin was an historic figure
who served his country during a time of momentous change," Bush
said in a statement.


The 76-year-old Yeltsin, who had long been unwell, died of a
heart attack at 3:45 pm (1145 GMT) in Moscow's Central Clinical
Hospital, presidential medical service chief Sergei Mironov told
Interfax news agency.


"He played a key role as the Soviet Union dissolved, helped lay
the foundations of freedom in Russia, and became the first
democratically elected leader in that country's history. I
appreciate the efforts that President Yeltsin made to build a
strong relationship between Russia and the United States," said
Bush.


"We offer our sincerest condolences to the Yeltsin family and to
the Russian people," said the US president.
