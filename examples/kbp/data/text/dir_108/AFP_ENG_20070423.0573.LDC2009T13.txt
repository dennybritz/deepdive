The IT outsourcing market in Russia will reach a billion dollars
in 2007, the chairman of the Russian branch of US semiconductor
giant Intel said on Monday.


"Hundreds of companies are investing in Russia in outsourcing -
this market is going to reach a billion dollars (740 million
euros) this year," Steve Chase told the Russian Economic Forum in
London.


Large foreign firms have realised that in Russia there are
"fantastic programmers they can't find in the US or India," and
are increasingly delegating projects to Russian companies, he
said.


"A vibrant IT market is developing in Russia. People know you
have to be in Russia because it's a very fast growing market,"
Chase added.


Intel has invested 700 million dollars (515 million euros) in
Russia in the last 15 years, while aircraft construction giant
Boeing and telecoms equipment firm Motorola have also set up
centres there employing local engineers.


Chase added that Google and HP have recently arrived on the
Russian market.
