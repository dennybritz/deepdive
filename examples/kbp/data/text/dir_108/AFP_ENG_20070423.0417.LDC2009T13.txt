European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso paid tribute to
former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who died Monday, saying
he helped bridge East and West after the collapse of Communism.


"As president he had enormous challenges and difficult mandates
but he certainly brought East and West closer together and helped
replace confrontation by cooperation," Barroso said in a
statement.


Yeltsin, who played a key role in the collapse of the Soviet
Union and introduced free market democracy to Russia, passed away
earlier Monday at the age of 76 from a heart attack.


He won admiration worldwide for bravely clambering onto a tank
sent into Moscow in 1991 by communist hardliners attempting a
coup in the dying days of the Soviet Union.


"He is best remembered when standing up to the coup d'etat aimed
at restoring a dictatorial regime in Russia," Barroso said. "With
great personal courage he had merit in defending freedom."
