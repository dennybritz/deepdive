A building of the Florida International University in Miami was
evacuated on Monday following a bomb threat, FIU said on its
website.


FIU said the building was being searched by law enforcement
officers.


The bomb threat is the latest at several at US universities in
the week since a South Korean student went on a rampage at
Virginia Tech University, killing 32 students and staff.
