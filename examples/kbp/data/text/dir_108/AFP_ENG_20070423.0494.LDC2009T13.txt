Three people were killed on Monday when a series of explosions
destroyed an Italian fireworks factory in the south of the
country, police said.


The dead included the owner of the factory at Gragnano, south of
Naples, his nephew and an employee, ANSA news agency cited police
as saying.


The fire brigade said that seven other people were injured while
the local hospital said that 10 were hurt, including one
seriously.


A charred foot was found in a field around a hundred metres
(yards) from the factory, ANSA said.


The explosions sparked panic among local inhabitants who feared
that an earthquake had taken place or that the nearby Mount
Vesuvius volcano was erupting, the report added.
