An Olympic Airlines plane carrying 11 Greek deputies from the
European Parliament made an emergency landing in Germany after a
bomb alert which turned out to be a hoax, the airline said on
Monday.


An unknown caller had contacted police in Athens claiming there
was a bomb on the flight from Athens to Brussels via Strasbourg,
carrying a total of 136 passengers, an airline spokeswoman told
AFP.


The flight left Athens at 9:30 am (0630 GMT) and landed around
two hours later in Munich after the threat. After a search found
nothing, authorisation was given for the flight to resume.
