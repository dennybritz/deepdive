A man who spent 25 years in jail for a rape he didn't commit had
his conviction quashed Monday on the basis of new DNA evidence,
bringing to 200 the number of cases overturned in similar fashion
nationwide since the 1980s.


A judge vacated Jerry Miller's conviction on all charges stemming
from the 1981 rape of a Chicago businesswoman, after his lawyers
and state prosecutors presented genetic evidence that ruled him
out as the attacker.


Miller, 48, already is out of jail, having been was paroled in
March 2006 after serving more than half of his sentence.


But Monday's finding means the conviction will be expunged from
his record, he will be removed from a list of convicted sex
offenders, and he no longer will be required to wear the
electronic tag that was a condition of his parole.


Just as importantly, it paves the way for him to seek
compensation from the state for his quarter century of
incarceration.
