Britain said on Monday it was "deeply concerned" by reports from
international observers that presidential elections in Nigeria
over the weekend had fallen short of international standards.


"We are deeply concerned at reports from international observers
that the elections held in Nigeria ... have fallen far short of
international standards and were seriously flawed," Foreign
Secretary Margaret Beckett said.


"These incidents have given rise to concerns that not all
Nigerians entitled to vote were able to do so freely and without
fear."


She said there were also substantiated reports from observers and
journalists of attempts to rig the voting or distort the result
after the count.


"We urge those disputing result to do so peacefully and through
the appropriate electoral tribunals.


"The eyes of Africa, and the world, have been on these elections
in Nigeria."


She said Britain would "continue to watch closely" how
authorities in the country responded to the concerns raised by
local citizens and international observers.


Ruling party candidate Umaru Yar'Adua was declared the winner of
the election on Monday, as the national election commission said
he had won Saturday's ballot with 24.6 million votes, well ahead
of his two main rivals.


But Nigeria's opposition parties immediately rejected the result,
citing rampant fraud, and said they would take the matter to
court.
