The army restored calm to an area of central Guinea late Monday
after several hundred traders ransacked and set fire to a police
station in reaction to alleged police brutality, witnesses said.


"Calm has returned. We came to negotiate with the young
(demonstrators) to get them to dismantle the barricades"
installed that morning, an army officer told AFP on condition of
anonymity.


According to witnesses in Kindia, some 130 kilometres (80 miles)
east of Conakry, several hundred people, most of them traders,
attacked the police station with sticks and stones before setting
it on fire.


The attack came after a local merchant claimed that about 15
armed police had barged into his home overnight Saturday, tied
him up and raped his wife and daughter. They also allegedly stole
property including money and gems.


The protestors set up barricades but the army officer said these
were dismantled "without violence" following intervention by
soldiers.


Officers stationed at the building had fled before the attack.


Deputy national police chief Alpha Oumar Balde rejected claims
that police officers were behind Saturday night's attack, saying
those responsible were "people disguised as police."


The army promised to "launch serious investigations to dismantle
the network of thugs, find those responsible (for the attack) and
punish them," the army officer added.


No-one was hurt and no-one was arrested in the protest.


Earlier this year, Guinea saw widespread violence against the
rule of ailing President Lansana Conte in which over 100 people
died.
