A car bomb devastated a restaurant in the western Iraq city of
Ramadi on Monday, killing four customers, a senior provincial
security official told AFP.


It was unclear whether the restaurant was attacked by a suicide
bomber but an insurgent did kill himself in a similar assault on
a nearby police checkpoint that wounded four officers and a
bystander, police Colonel Tareq al-Dulaimi said.


"I cannot confirm the attack on the restaurant was a suicide
attack, there are many body parts. There are 20 people wounded,
some of them seriously," said Dulaimi, who works with a coalition
of tribes opposed to Al-Qaeda.


A third bomb was made safe by US forces, he added.


A spokesman for US Marines based in Ramadi said reports indicated
that both attacks were carried out by suicide car bombers.


"There were actually two separate suicide attacks in Ramadi this
afternoon. The only casualties I can confirm right now are the
two bombers. The attacks were suicide car bombs," said US Marine
Lieutenant Roger Hollenbeck.


Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf, director of the interior
ministry operations centre in Baghdad, said the assault was
launched at 5:45 pm (1445 GMT) and caused multiple casualties,
although he could not give figures.


Iraqi and US forces are battling an anti-American insurgency in
Ramadi four years after the March 2003 invasion of the country,
but an alliance of Sunni tribes dubbed the "Anbar Awakening" has
sided with them.
