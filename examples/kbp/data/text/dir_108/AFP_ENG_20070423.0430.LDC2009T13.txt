EU regulators cleared General Electric's plans to acquire Smiths
Aerospace, a British supplier to aircraft manufacturers, after
finding the deal would not threaten competition.


"The Commission's investigation found that the proposed
transaction would not significantly impede competition," the
European Union's antitrust watchdog said in a statement after
reviewing the deal.


General Electric reached an agreement in Janaury to buy Smiths
Aerospace, a unit of the Smiths Group, in January for 4.8 billion
dollars (3.5 billion euros) in cash.


Smiths Aerospace produces integrated systems for flight
management, electrical power management and control of mechanical
functions.
