Russia's former president Boris Yeltsin will be buried on
Wednesday in Moscow, the Kremlin said, declaring it a day of
national mourning.


Yeltsin, who brought down the Soviet Union and led Russia through
a traumatic introduction to democracy and capitalism, died Monday
aged 76 from a heart attack.
