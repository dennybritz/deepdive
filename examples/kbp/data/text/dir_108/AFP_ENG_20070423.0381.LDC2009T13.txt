For the sixth day out of eight, racing was cancelled in the Louis
Vuitton Cup as once again a lack of wind scuppered the
competition.


The start of racing had earlier been delayed by two hours but as
the wind failed to pick up sufficiently, racing was again
cancelled.


So far, only Friday and Sunday have seen any racing and Luna Rosa
Challenge and BMW Oracle Racing lead the standings with nine
points each after three wins apiece.


Early favourites Emirates Team New Zealand are next with six
points having picked up their first win on Sunday following a
shock defeat to Italians Mascalzone Latino on Friday.


The round robin stages of the Louis Vuitton are due to run until
May 7 or 8, with the semi-finals scheduled for May 14-25 and the
final on June 1-12.


The winner goes on to challenge Swiss defender Alinghi for the
32nd America's Cup best of nine match series starting from June
23.
