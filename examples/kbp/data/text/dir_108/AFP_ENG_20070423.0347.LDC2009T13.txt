Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said Monday he was
considering proposing the withdrawal of Romanian troops from Iraq
by the end of the year.


"During the next meeting (of the Surpeme Defence Council) it is
possible that I'll make such a proposition, or at least that it
will be made by the interim president," Tariceanu said.


Interim head of state Nicolae Vacaroiu replaced president Traian
Basescu last week after the latter was suspended for allegedly
violating the constitution.


Basescu has been a strong advocate of keeping Romania's more than
600 troops in Iraq for as long as they Iraqi government needs
them.


Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu made a lightning trip to Iraq
earlier this month and said the withdrawal of Romanian forces was
one of his top priorities.


Romania has 603 troops in Iraq, including over 400 charged with
monitoring checkpoints and oil facilities and another 100 in the
main southern city of Basra where they protect UN personnel.
