UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the late Russian leader
Boris Yeltsin as key to promoting reforms in Russia and to East-
West rapprochement, a spokeswoman said Monday.


"The secretary general was saddened to learn today of the death
of Boris Yeltsin, the first democratically elected President of
the Russian Federation," spokeswoman Michele Montas said in a
statement.


"President Yeltsin will be remembered for the critical role he
played in advancing political and economic reforms in Russia, as
well as in fostering rapprochement between East and West."


Yeltsin, the former president who brought down the Soviet Union
and led Russia through the traumatic transition to democracy and
capitalism, died Monday aged 76 from a heart attack.
