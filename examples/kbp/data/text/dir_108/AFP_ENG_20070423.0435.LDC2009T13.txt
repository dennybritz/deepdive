US aerospace giant Boeing and Aviation Capital Group said Monday
that the big leasing firm had placed an order worth 1.6 billion
dollars for 20 new Boeing jets.


The deal includes 15 next-generation 737 jets and five 787, fuel
efficient, Dreamliner aircraft. Boeing had previously attributed
the hefty sales contract to an unidentified buyer.


Aviation Capital is one of the world's largest aircraft leasing
groups and already has 138 Boeing aircraft in its fleet. The
companies' statement did not divulge delivery details.
