Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa reshuffled his cabinet on
Monday, sacking his health minister and promoting several junior
ministers.


Health minister Angela Cifire was fired and replaced by science
and technology minister Brian Chituwo, said presidential
spokesman John Musukuma.


Deputy foreign minister Mike Mulongoti was promoted to
information minister while energy minister Felix Mutati was given
the commerce ministry, Musukuma said.


The deputy sports minister Patricia Mulasikwanda was also
promoted to a full ministerial post responsible for gender
matters while transport minister Peter Daka shifted to the
science and technology ministry.


Minister for gender Sarah Sayifwanda had moved over to transport,
said Musukuma.


The changes are with immediate effect, Musukuma said.


Two weeks ago, Mwanawasa sacked his information minister Vernon
Mwaanga for indiscipline during a trip to the Democratic Republic
of Congo.
