Northampton will sign South African back-row forward Joe van
Niekerk next season, if they beat the drop this term, the club's
owner Keith Barwell said Monday.


Barwell told BBC Radio Northampton: "Well, we have signed him. He
has got a release clause in his contract to say he could avoid
coming if we get relegated. That works both ways of course."


Northampton currently sit bottom of the Premiership standings in
England but did reach the European Cup semi-finals this season,
losing to Wasps at the weekend.


Van Niekerk, 26, plays for Western Province in South Africa.
