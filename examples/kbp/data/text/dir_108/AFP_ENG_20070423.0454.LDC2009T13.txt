The Australian group Summit Resources said Monday an investment
deal with the French nuclear company Areva had been dropped after
Summit received an improved offer from another Australian firm,
Paladin Resources.


Summit, which specialises in uranium exploration, recalled in a
statement received here that it had reached agreement with Areva
on April 11 under which the French company would acquire a stake
of up to 18 percent in Summit.


But a day later Paladin Resources announced that it would
increase its bid for Summit from one Paladin share for every 2.04
Summit shares to one for every 1.67 shares.


The Summit board, according to the statement, unanimously
recommended that company shareholders accept the improved Paladin
offer.


"As a result of these developments and various discussions that
Summit has had with Paladin, Summit confirms that the Areva
transaction announced on April 11 will no longer be put to Summit
shareholders for approval and will therefore not proceed," the
statement said.
