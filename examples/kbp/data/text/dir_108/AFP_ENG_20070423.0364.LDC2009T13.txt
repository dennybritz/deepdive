Rescuers in remote southern Chile on Monday were searching for
seven people missing and feared to have been swept out to sea
following a powerful earthquake already blamed for three deaths.


Police and military patrols combed the area around the Aysen
fjord where Saturday's 6.2-magnitude earthquake caused landslides
to plunge into the inlet, creating six-meter (20-foot waves.)


On Sunday, rescuers recovered three bodies in the Aysen area,
1,300 kilometers (812 miles) south of Santiago.


President Michelle Bachelet visited the area on Sunday to
supervise the rescue efforts.


Chile's Patagonia, where Aysen is located, has been rocked by
more than 100 temblors this year. Experts believe the intense
seismic activity is caused by the formation of a new underwater
volcano.
