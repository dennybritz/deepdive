Sweden is considering introducing a law to criminalise the
"grooming" of children for sex, including through Internet chat
rooms, the justice ministry said Monday.


In a proposal submitted to the justice minister, prosecutor-
general Fredrik Wersaell said adults should not be allowed to
contact children under the age of 15 on the Internet, by phone or
in person if the intent is to commit a sexual offence.


If the proposed legislation were to be adopted, Sweden would go
further than many other countries in fighting sexual abuse of
children.


A similar law was introduced in Britain in 2003, under which
adults who set up meetings with children after "grooming" them
for sex risk up to six months in prison.


A report from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention
published on Monday showed an increase in such "grooming" in line
with the growth of chat rooms and Internet communities.


The study showed that almost 40 percent of ninth-grade girls --
aged 15 -- had been approached on the Internet by strangers they
perceived as adults expressing a sexual interest. It said some
such contacts lead to children being sexually abused.


The proposed legislation has been put forward by a government-
commissioned inquiry. It has recommended that the new law enter
into force in July 2008.
