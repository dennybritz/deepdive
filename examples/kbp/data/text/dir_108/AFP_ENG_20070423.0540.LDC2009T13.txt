Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed his predecessor Boris
Yeltsin, who died Monday aged 76, as the man who gave birth to "a
newly democratic Russia."


Yeltsin would always be remembered as the first president of the
post-Soviet Russian Federation, Putin said.


Under Yeltsin "a newly democratic Russia was born, and a free
nation opened to the world. A state where power really rests with
the people," he added.


Yeltsin was instrumental in drawing up a new constitution for
Russia with human rights at the forefront and ensuring freedom of
thought and free elections, Putin said.


Yeltsin will be buried on Wednesday in Moscow, the Kremlin said,
declaring it a day of national mourning.


Yeltsin, who brought down the Soviet Union and led Russia through
a traumatic introduction to democracy and capitalism, died Monday
aged 76 from a heart attack.
