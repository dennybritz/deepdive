Slovenian President Janez Drnovsek will not run for re-election
in autumn elections, state radio cited his spokeswoman as saying
on Monday.


The 56 year-old was elected president in elections in 2002 and
was entitled under the constitution to run for a second term.


Drnovsek was prime minister from 1992 to 2002 and was one of the
main architects of Slovenia's transition from independence from
socialist Yugoslavia to becoming a European Union and eurozone
member.


Drnovsek, diagnosed with lung and liver cancer three years ago,
said last year he was considering not running for a second term
but later denied having taken a final decision.


The presidential elections are to be by the end of the year and
so far only one politician, former prime minister Lojze Peterle,
has announced he will stand.
