Singapore and Indonesia will sign a landmark extradition treaty
later this week, the foreign ministers of both nations said late
Monday.


The accord, which Jakarta considers vital in its pursuit of
suspects wanted in Indonesia for corruption, will be signed on
Friday, a joint statement said.


Lawmakers in Jakarta have said the city state is used by
Indonesian criminals to launder money.


Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo and Indonesian Foreign
Minister Hassan Wirayuda will sign the pact in ceremonies in Bali
to be witnessed by their respective leaders, the statement said.


The defence ministers of the both nations will also sign a
defence cooperation agreement which had been negotiated in
parallel with the extradition pact.
