Nigeria's main opposition parties rejected Monday the victory of
ruling party candidate Umaru Yar'Adua in presidential elections
and said they would take the matter to court.


Action Congress contender Atiku Abubakar, who is also vice
president, and Muhammadu Buhari of the All Nigeria People's Party
(ANPP) both alleged rampant voter fraud in Saturday's poll.


ANPP official Tom Ekimi said both parties "reject the results and
we're going to take up the matter legally in court."


His remarks came just hours after the national election
commission declared Yar'Adua the winner of the vote with 24.6
million votes, far ahead of his two main rivals.


"Elections did not take place in most parts of Nigeria," Ekimi
said, alleging that results for just 11 of Nigeria's 36 states
were properly collated.


He accused the election commission of having "cooked up" the
result in its desperation to pronounce a winner.


Buhari was credited with 6.6 million votes and Abubakar with 2.6
million.
