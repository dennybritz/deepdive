Adherents to the neo-pagan cult Wicca soon will be permitted to
place their symbol the pentacle -- a five-pointed star inscribed
inside a circle -- on headstones in military cemeteries, US
officials said Monday.


After months of legal wrangling, the US Department of Veterans
Affairs agreed to allow Wiccans to place the symbol on
headstones, as do adherents to the Christian, Muslim and Jewish
and other faiths. The policy change will go into effect in the
next few months, officials said.


"VA will be adding the pentacle to its list of approved emblems
of belief that will be engraved on government-provided markers,"
said Matt Burns a spokesman for the federal agency.


The Wiccans, which have tens of thousands of adherents across the
United States, were represented by the American Civil Liberties
Union, the rights watchdog group.


"It is deeply unfortunate that grieving families of deceased
veterans were forced to undertake a bureaucratic struggle to have
their loved ones' wishes honored," said Aaron Caplan, an ACLU
attorney who represented the Wiccans in the case.


"All veterans, regardless of their religion, deserve to have
their faith recognized on an equal basis," he said.
