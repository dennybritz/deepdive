Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels set off a bomb in northern Sri
Lanka, killing three bus passengers and wounding another 35, the
defence ministry said Tuesday.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) set off the blast in
the district of Vavuniya, 250 kilometres (156 miles) north of
Colombo just before midnight on Monday, the ministry said.


Military officials here said they suspected that the blast was
caused by a mine planted by the side of the road to target the
bus travelling from the neighbouring district of Mannar.


A similar blast hit another bus in the same area 16 days ago,
killing eight passengers and wounding 25.


That attack came five days after a bomb exploded inside a bus in
the east of the island, killing 17 people and wounding 25.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
violence that began in December 2005, despite a truce arranged in
2002 to end the bloody ethnic conflict.


The Tigers have waged a 35-year campaign for independence for the
Tamil minority that has claimed more than 60,000 lives on the
Sinhalese-majority island.
