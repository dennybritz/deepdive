US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said Monday Americans would
never forget former president Boris Yeltsin's defiant stand
against a 1991 military coup.


Gates who was in Moscow for meetings with Russian leaders when
Yeltsin's death was announced, expressed condolences to his
family and the Russian people.


"He was an important figure in Russian history," he said.


"No American, at least, will forget seeing him standing on the
tank outside the White House resisting the coup attempt," he
said, referring to the parliamentary headquarters in Moscow.


From the headquarters building, Yeltsin galvanized popular
resistance to an abortive attempt by the military to overthrow
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.


Yeltsin died earlier on Monday from a heart attack. He was 76.
