Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt hailed former Russian
president Boris Yeltsin, who died Monday, as a "great man" who
gave Russia direction during a crucial period of uncertainty.


"President Yeltsin was without a doubt -- with all of the human
weaknesses that no one is free of -- one of the truly great men
of our time," Bildt said in a statement.


Bildt served as Sweden's prime minister from 1991 to 1994, during
Yeltsin's term as Russian president.


"When everything was uncertain in the crumbling Soviet Union, it
was he who staked out a new direction by abolishing the Soviet
Union and granting independence to the three Baltic states,"
Bildt added.


"His dissociation from communism was unambiguous, and he clearly
steered the new Russia toward an increasingly close relationship
with Europe," he said.
