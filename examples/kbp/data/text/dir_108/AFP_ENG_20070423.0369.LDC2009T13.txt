Kyrgyzstan's internal security service arrested a senior
opposition figure on Monday in connection with unrest in the
capital last week, his lawyer said.


Omurbek Suvanaliyev will be held for three days for questioning
about clashes at a recent opposition rally, his lawyer, Tatyana
Chinikina, told AFP.


Suvanaliyev is chief of staff at the opposition United Front for
a Decent Future for Kyrgyzstan and a former interior minister.


Medet Taliyev, chief investigator at the GKNB secret service,
confirmed to AFP that Suvanaliyev had been placed under arrest
but refused to say why, citing the ongoing inquiry.


Last week demonstrations against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev
descended into violence as thousands of people gathered outside
his office and rocks and bottles were hurled at the building.


Police responded with tear gas and flares.


The United Front's chief, former prime minister Felix Kulov, was
questioned by the GKNB on Saturday.


Strategically located on China's western edge and host to US and
Russian airbases, Kyrgyzstan has experienced regular
demonstrations and unrest since president Askar Akayev was ousted
in an uprising in 2005.
