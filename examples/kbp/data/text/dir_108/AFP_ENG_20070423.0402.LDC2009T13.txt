China's Ding Junhui was sent crashing out of the World
Championships on Monday as former champion Ronnie O'Sullivan
completed a decisive 10-2 first round win.


The 20-year-old Chinese prodigy was blown away 8-1 by O'Sullivan
in the first session of the best-of-19 clash on Sunday and there
was no miracle for him when the tie resumed Monday afternoon.


Ding pulled a frame back in the 10th, but twice former champion
O'Sullivan responded with an 87 break in the 11th and then closed
things out in the following frame.


He will now play the winner of the tie between Ryan Day and Neil
Robertson, in the second round.


For Ding there was only the experienced gained of playing in his
first World Championships up against the most gifted shotmaker in
the game.
