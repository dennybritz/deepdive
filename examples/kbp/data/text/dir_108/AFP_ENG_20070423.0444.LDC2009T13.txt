The United States Coast Guard seized more than 38,000 pounds
(17.2 metric tonnes) of cocaine in what was described as the
largest maritime drug bust in history, authorities said Monday.


The US Coast Guard was set to unload around 40,000 pounds of the
drug later Monday following three separate raids off the coast of
Central America during February in March, a statement said.


The raids included one bust where 38,000 pounds of cocaine, said
to be worth 500 million dollars, was seized after the US coast
guard swooped on a Panamanian- registered boat off the coast of
Panama on March 18.


When US authorities boarded the vessel they found the record
cocaine haul stuffed into 765 bales. The boat and its 14 crew
members were escorted back to Panama for further legal action.


US Coast Guard petty officer Alan Haraf told AFP the previous
record cocaine busts were a haul of 30,000 pounds in 2004 and
26,300 pounds in 2001.


The statement said drug-trafficking routes through the Pacific
Ocean onto America's western seaboard were among the most popular
used by smugglers, accounting for roughly 70 percent of cocaine
seized by the Coast Guard.


The Coast Guard has prevented around two million pounds of
cocaine from reaching America's streets since 1973, the statement
added.
