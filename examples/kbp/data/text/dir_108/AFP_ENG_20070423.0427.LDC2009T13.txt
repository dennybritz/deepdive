South Africa President Thabo Mbeki hailed Boris Yeltsin as a
friend of his country on Monday after the Kremlin announced the
death of the late Russian leader.


"The late President Yeltsin was indeed a friend of South Africa
in his endeavours to consolidate and strengthen political,
cultural and people-to- people relations between the Russian
Federation and South Africa," said Mbeki in a statement.


"In this regard, the government and people of South Africa join
the international community in sharing its thoughts and prayers
with the family of the late President Yeltsin, the government and
people of the Russian Federation during this period of national
mourning."


Yeltsin was Russian president during the demise of the apartheid
era of whites- only rule in South Africa in 1994 and Moscow was
regarded as a significant diplomatic ally of the African National
Congress (ANC).
