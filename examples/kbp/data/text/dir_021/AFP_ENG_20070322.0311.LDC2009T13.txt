The Zimbabwean government has urged African nations to join hands
to fight domination by powerful Western countries, state- media
reported Thursday.


"The new global village... poses the danger of forcing the poor,
newly independent and formerly exploited countries like Zimbabwe
to play the game when the table is badly tilted against them,"
Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said during a lecture to
army chiefs at the Zimbabwe Staff College.


He said countries like Zimbabwe, Tanzania and South Africa should
"stand fighting for their space."


He accused global media networks of biased coverage of Zimbabwe
and called for African countries to transmit their own
information overseas.


"Let's have our own inventors to compete with those who are ahead
of us... the whole world is being given one-sided information
about us," Ndlovu said.


Last week, the government expressed outrage at what it termed
biased coverage by Western media such as the BBC and CNN of the
arrest and beating of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai while
in police custody last week.


Many Zimbabweans have turned to foreign-based radio stations and
television channels for an alternative to broadcasts by
government-controlled radio and television stations.


There are no private radio stations operating in the southern
African nation despite an amendment six years ago to the
broadcasting law which was designed to end the monopoly of the
government-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Holdings.
