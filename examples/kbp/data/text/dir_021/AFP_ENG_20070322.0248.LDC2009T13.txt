Indian petrochemicals giant Reliance and US-based Rohm and Haas,
the world's biggest acrylic paint ingredient maker, said Thursday
they may build a "world- scale" chemical plant in India.


Reliance Industries Ltd and Rohm and Haas Co have signed a
memorandum of understanding "to explore joint construction of a
world-scale acrylic-monomer complex," the companies said in a
joint statement.


The plant would make 200,000 tons a year of acrylic acid and
would be located at the site of Reliance's 660,000 barrel per day
refinery in Jamnagar, in western India.


The output would be used for environmentally friendly textiles,
paints and coatings, packaging adhesives, detergents and
construction materials. The new facility could also spur
development of super absorbent polymers, used mainly in making
diapers.


The proposed plant "is expected to be world scale," the statement
said.


A spokesman for Reliance, India's leading refiner and
petrochemicals manufacturer, would not specify the amount of the
proposed investment or stake each company would hold.


"While the key objective would be to serve domestic market needs,
the complex could also export acrylic acid and derivatives," said
the companies.


Reliance is consolidating and expanding its chemical operations,
which contribute about 45 percent to its earnings.
