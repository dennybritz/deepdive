Air France said on Thursday it would apply a four-euro
(5.3-dollar) fuel surcharge on long-haul flights from French
airports.


A company spokesman said the charge would be 8.0 euros on long-
haul round trips, adding that the charge would be dropped once
the price of oil stayed below 60 dollars a barrel for 30 straight
days.


In early Asian trading Thursday New York's main oil futures
contract, light sweet crude for delivery in May, was up 40 cents
to 60.01 dollars a barrel.


Brent North Sea crude for May delivery gained 43 cents to 61.20
dollars.


In The Hague, Dutch carrier KLM, which is owned by Air France-
KLM, said that the fuel surcharge on its tickets purchased in the
Netherlands would be five euros on long-haul flights and one euro
on European flights.
