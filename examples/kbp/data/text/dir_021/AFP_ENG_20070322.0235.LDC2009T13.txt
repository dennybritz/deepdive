Bank of China said Thursday that it had not yet been asked to
handle a transfer of 25 million dollars of North Korean assets in
a dispute that has thrown disarmament talks into disarray.


"Up to now we have not been asked to do this business," Li Lihui,
the vice chairman and president of the Bank of China, told
reporters in Hong Kong.


The assets have been frozen in a Macau bank since 2005 amid US
accusations of money laundering and counterfeiting by North
Korea.


The United States earlier this week announced that the money
could now be released, raising hopes of progress at nuclear
disarmament talks in Beijing this week, but those negotiations
ended abruptly Thursday when North Korea's envoy flew home
because the cash had still not been transferred.
