The mainland's Bank of China reported Thursday a 65 percent rise
in 2006 net profit to 42.83 billion yuan on strong operating
income, improved credit costs and reduction in taxes.


The bank reported net interest income of 121.27 billion yuan for
2006, up from 101 billion a year earlier, while operating income
rose 18 percent to 148.4 billion yuan.


"This increase was primarily due to the continued increase in the
average balances of loans and investment securities, as well as
an increase in average yields," it said.


"The substantial improvement in profit after tax for the year was
attributable to robust growth in operating income, improved
operating efficiency, effective management of credit costs and a
decrease in the effective tax rate," it added.
