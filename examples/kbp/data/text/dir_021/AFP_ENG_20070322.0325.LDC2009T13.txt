A mortar blast rocked Baghdad's fortified Green Zone on Thursday
as Ban Ki-moon held a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki, causing the UN chief to flinch.


After a brief pause, both men continued to take questions at an
event marking Ban's first visit to the Iraqi capital.


An Iraqi security official said the explosion had been caused by
a mortar shell fired into the area. There were no initial reports
of casualties.


The loud blast sent a column of smoke and dust into the sky near
the northern edge of the Green Zone, opposite the Jumhuriyah
Bridge in downtown Baghdad in a heavily policed area surrounded
by government offices.


Immediately before the explosion, Ban told reporters: "I'm
confident that we'll be able to see, in the near future, a more
prosperous and secure... and a healthier future of the Iraqi
people and government."


Maliki, whose live televised events have been disrupted by bomb
attacks in the past, appeared unruffled by the latest blast.


A bomb at the UN headquarters in Baghdad on August 19, 2003
killed 22 people, including top UN envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.
