The head of French oil giant Total was transferred to the French
judiciary's serious financial crime unit on Thursday after being
held overnight by police probing suspected corruption in an
Iranian gas deal.


Total chief executive Christophe de Margerie was released from
detention by financial police but was immediately transferred to
the serious fraud unit, where he was to appear before Judge
Philippe Courroye, according to sources close to the matter.


Margerie faces the possible opening of a judicial investigation,
the first step toward formal charges.


Margerie had been taken in for questioning by police on Wednesday
morning, along with four other Total executives, who were set
free on Wednesday night.


The investigation centres on suspicions that Total paid nearly
100 million Swiss francs (60 million euros, 80 million dollars),
traced through two accounts in Switzerland, to win a contract in
Iran, a source close to the matter told AFP.


A Total spokesman acknowledged that executives from the company
faced questioning "in connection with a judicial enquiry" opened
in December 2006 concerning "a South Pars industrial project in
Iran, signed by Total in 1997 with the Iranian national oil
company NIOC."


Total was "completely behind its executives and confirms that the
agreements signed respected the law," the spokesman added.
