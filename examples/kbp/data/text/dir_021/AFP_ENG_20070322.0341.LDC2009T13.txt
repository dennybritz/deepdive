The leaders of Turkey and Egypt discussed the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and Iraq on Thursday, warning that perisisting bloodshed
is increasing despair among people in the Middle East.


"We agree on the necessity to revive the peace process that will
lead to an independent Palestinian state. The same efforts are
needed to ensure Iraq's stability, national reconciliation and
territorial integrity," Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
after talks with Turkish counterpart Ahmet Necdet Sezer.


"We should avoid creating further sources of problems in the
region," he said.


Sezer stressed that "the worsening problems in the Middle East
are fuelling pessimism among the people" and called on the
international community to step up efforts to help the settlement
of problems.


"Turkey and Egypt ... have important duties in this respect," he
said.


Mainly Muslim secular Turkey is Israel's main regional ally but
also enjoys warm relations with the Palestinians and supports
their claims for statehood.


Even though its close ties with Israel have often irked Arab
countries, Ankara believes it is in a good position to mediate in
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.


Mubarak and Sezer also dicussed bilateral ties and underlined
determination to boost economic cooperation.


Mubarak was scheduled to meet also with Prime Minister Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and Chief of
General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit before warpping up his two-
day visit on Friday.
