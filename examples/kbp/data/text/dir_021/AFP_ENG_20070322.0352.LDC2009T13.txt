A Mexican man alleged to have drunkenly threatened to blow up a
New Delhi-bound flight from Bangkok has been remanded in custody
and could face 10 years in an Indian jail, officials said
Thursday.


The 47-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday after the Airbus
operated by carrier Indian made an emergency landing in this
eastern city.


He was described as being "extremely drunk" and barely able to
walk, and no explosives were found.


"Febles Ortiz Eduardo Antonio, 47, has been charged with unlawful
activities and intimidation under the Indian Civil Aviation Act,"
public prosecutor Asimesh Goswami said after the man appeared
before a district magistrate.


The next court session has been scheduled for April 5, with the
Mexican facing up to a decade behind bars.


According to an Indian airline spokesman, he had allegedly told
the passenger sitting next to him that "he was carrying bomb
which he could trigger if needed."


The drama aboard the plane, which was carrying 82 passengers and
six crew, ended with police at Kolkata's at Dum Dum International
Airport storming the aircraft and hauling away the man after
passengers raised the alarm.


The plane resumed its journey after being grounded for nearly two
hours and given the all-clear.
