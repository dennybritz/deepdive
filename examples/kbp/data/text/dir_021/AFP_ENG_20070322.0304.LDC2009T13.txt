A Paris court on Thursday acquitted the editor of a satirical
French weekly, sued by two Muslim groups for publishing cartoons
of the Prophet Mohammed.


Applause broke out in the courtroom at the announcement of the
verdict, which ruled that the three cartoons published in
February 2006 were not insulting to the Muslim community.
