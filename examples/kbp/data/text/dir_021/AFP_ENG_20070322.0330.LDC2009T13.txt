Shots were fired Thursday morning near the home of an ex-vice
president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, an area where the
army has stepped up its presence, officialsa said.


The sounds of automatic weapons fire were followed by that of
rocket launchers, a security official said.


Dozens of soldiers and UN armoured vehicles were deployed outside
Jean-Pierre Bemba's residence on Tuesday amid fears of clashes
with his security guards.


"Bemba's men stepped up their provocations this morning," the
security official said Thursday. "They left their perimeter (at
the residence) and were singing and dancing with red bands on
their heads in a sign of war."


Bemba and Azarias Ruberwa, whose rebel movements battled Kinshasa
until 2003, were vice-presidents during a post-war transition to
democratic rule overseen by the United Nations.


The transition process ended last year with the first democratic
elections in more than four decades. Joseph Kabila was
inaugurated as president in December.


Both Bemba and Ruberwa oppose the withdrawal of their military
protection. They say a guard of 12 police officers assigned to
them by presidential decree is insufficient.
