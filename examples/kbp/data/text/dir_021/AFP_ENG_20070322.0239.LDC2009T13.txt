Japan on Thursday pressed China to halt discriminatory measures
against foreign firms during talks on a trilateral investment
treaty also involving South Korea, officials said.


Japan wants China to do more to protect intellectual property
rights, to ban discriminatory requirements for foreign investors
and makes its rules more easily understood.


"Japan and South Korea have a common interest in calling on China
to create a more transparent and rule-based investment
environment," a foreign ministry official said ahead of the two
days of talks in Tokyo.


"The realisation of a trilateral treaty is also important as it
conveys a symbolic message of cooperation between the three
countries," she added.


There is no timetable for the signing of the three-way treaty
although the official said Japan would like to see an agreement
sealed as soon as possible.


Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has worked to ease tensions
with China since taking office in September, but angered
neighbouring nations this month by denying that Japan coerced
thousands of Asian women into war-time brothels.


Japanese business leaders have lobbied the government to improve
ties with fast- growing China, which is one of Japan's largest
economic partners.
