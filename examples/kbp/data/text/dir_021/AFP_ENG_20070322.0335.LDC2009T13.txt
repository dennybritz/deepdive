Britain will grant 35 billion pounds (69 billion dollars, 52
billion euros) to Northern Ireland over the next four years,
finance minister Gordon Brown said Thursday.


The chancellor of the exchequer spent the morning in talks with
Northern Ireland's political parties discussing a financial
package for the British-run province.


The talks were part of moves to restore the devolved Northern
Irish Assembly, with Protestant and Catholic parties forming a
power-sharing executive, by a Monday deadline.


Brown announced the 35-billion-pound figure alongside measures to
improve job prospects in the province.


He also announced a review to see what could be done about the
difference in corporation tax rates between Northern Ireland --
which has the same rate as the rest of the United Kingdom -- and
the Republic of Ireland, where the rate is significantly lower.


The financial package is dependent on Protestant and Catholic
parties in Northern Ireland reaching agreement to set up a power-
sharing executive by next Monday.
