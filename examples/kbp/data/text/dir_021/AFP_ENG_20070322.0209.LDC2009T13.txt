Eurozone factories saw new orders ease in January, although they
surged over one year, the European Union's Eurostat data agency
said Thursday.


New industrial orders in the 13 countries sharing the euro
slipped 0.2 percent over one month but jumped 12 percent over one
year, Eurostat said.


Despite the slight fall, the result was better than expectations
from private economists for a slump of 1.0 percent over one
month.


However, it marked a slowdown from December when new orders rose
1.8 percent over one month and 1.9 percent over one year to a
10-year high.


Eurostat revised the December figures sharply lower from a
previous estimate of a 2.8 percent jump over one month and a 1.6
percent increase over one year.


In the broader European Union, new industrial orders fell 1.6
percent over one month in January but rose 10.1 percent over one
year.
