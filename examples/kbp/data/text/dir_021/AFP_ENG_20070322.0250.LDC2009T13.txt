EU transport ministers gave their backing Thursday for plans to
expose the transatlantic aviation market to tougher competition
under an "open skies" accord, EU officials said.


"I am delighted to have piloted this agreement to its destination
with all passengers still on board," EU Transport Minister
Jacques Barrot said. "The deal is of great political and economic
importance."


The European Commission, which negotiated the deal on the EU's
behalf, says consumers will see up to 12 billion euros (16
billion dollars) in economic benefits as increased competition
brings downs ticket prices.
