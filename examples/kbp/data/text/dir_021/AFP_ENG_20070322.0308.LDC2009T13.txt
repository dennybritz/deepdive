A Paris court on Thursday acquitted the editor of a satirical
French weekly, sued by two Muslim groups for publishing cartoons
of the Prophet Mohammed.


Applause broke out in the courtroom at the announcement of the
verdict, which ruled that the three cartoons published by the
weekly Charlie Hebdo in February 2006 were not insulting to the
Muslim community.


The Paris Grand Mosque and the Union of Islamic Organisations of
France took Charlie Hebdo editor Philippe Val to court for
reprinting cartoons that first appeared in a Danish newspaper,
sparking angry protests by Muslims worldwide.


They argued at the trial last month that the cartoons drew an
offensive link between Islam and terrorism and asked for 30,000
euros (38,750 dollars) in damages.


One of the cartoons reprinted from Denmark's Jyllands-Posten
showed Mohammed wearing a turban shaped as a bomb, and a second
showing the prophet standing on a cloud, turning away suicide
bombers from paradise with the caption "Stop, stop, we ran out of
virgins."


A separate drawing by French cartoonist Cabu showed Mohammed
sobbing, holding his head in his hands and saying: "It is hard to
be loved by fools.


The trial was seen as an important test for freedom of expression
in France and large crowds crammed into the Paris courtroom to
hear the arguments put by both sides.
