Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has scoffed at reports he could
be leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid and insisted he was happy to
stay at Anfield.


The Spanish giants have had a troubled season both on and off the
field and doubts have been swirling around the future of the
club's Italian manager Fabio Capello who only just joined them
last year.


Benitez, who joined Liverpool from Valencia in 2004, was born in
Madrid and represented the club as a player. His name has
regularly been linked with a move to the Bernabeu.


But he has ruled out any such move, telling Liverpool's official
website: "I think it's important the fans know I am completely
committed to Liverpool Football Club and I'm going nowhere.


"I know there's been a lot of speculation in the Spanish media
linking me with Real Madrid.


"Any manager would be honoured to be associated with such a
famous club, especially as Madrid is my home city and also my
former club.


"However, I want to make it clear I am very happy at Anfield and
very happy in England and I'm genuinely excited by what the
future holds for Liverpool."
