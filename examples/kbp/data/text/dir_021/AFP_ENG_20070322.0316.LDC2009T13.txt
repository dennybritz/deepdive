British retail sales leapt by 1.4 percent in February from the
previous month, the biggest monthly gain since January 2005,
according to official data on Thursday.


The release, which sparked talk of a British interest rate hike
some time soon, sent the pound as high as 1.9726 dollars.


Retail sales were 4.9 percent higher than in February 2006,
marking the largest annual increase since November 2004, the
Office for National Statistics (ONS) added.


Thursday's news was "a much stronger than expected data which is
likely to rekindle April rate hike talks," according to Audrey-
Childe-Freeman, economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in London.


Analysts' consensus forecasts had been for a monthly gain of 0.5
percent an an annual increase of 3.7 percent.


Bank of England policymakers had voted 8-1 to keep British
borrowing costs steady at 5.25 percent in March owing partly to
financial market volatility, minutes of their latest meeting
showed on Wednesday.


However one Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymaker
surprisingly called for a quarter-point cut at the meeting.


"We were surprised by how much weight the MPC appeared to put on
the January figures in the March minutes and today's data may
persuade some floating voters that previous monetary tightening
has not had much effect on consumer demand," said Alan Castle,
economist at Lehman Brothers.


"We are sticking with our call for an April rate hike after this
week's strong economic data and the recent stabilisation in
financial markets."
