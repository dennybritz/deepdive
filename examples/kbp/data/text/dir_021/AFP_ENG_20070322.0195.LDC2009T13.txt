Heavy fighting broke out Thursday in previously calm northern
neighbourhoods of the Somali capital as Somali-Ethiopian forces
exchanged mortar and machine gun fire with insurgents.


"Heavy artillery shells are being used by the government forces
and the rebels. We are inside our houses and very scared. There
are stray bullets everywhere," said Bashir Mohamed, a resident of
the northern Gupta neighbourhood.


"Most of the people have fled and others are still trapped," he
added.


An AFP correspondent said he saw two Ethiopian tanks rumbling
towards other fighting in southern Wadajir neighbourhood.


"There is heavy machine gun and anti-aircraft weapon fire. Both
sides are using every weapon they have. People have fled," said
Hassan Mohamed, a Wadajir resident.


Hundreds of terrified Somalis fled Mogadishu on Thursday, a day
after a government crackdown triggered heavy fighting across the
south of the coastal city in which at least 14 people were
killed, including soldiers who were dragged and burned in the
street.


Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi later ordered civilians to leave
areas in southern Mogadishu "for security reasons", in a radio
broadcast.


Dozens of people have died since January when joint Somali-
Ethiopian forces ousted an Islamist movement from south and
central Somalia, including the capital, but suspected Islamist
insurgents and allied factions have responded with deadly
guerrilla warfare.
