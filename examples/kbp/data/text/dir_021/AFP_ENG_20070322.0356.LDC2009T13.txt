France will soon reduce its forces in Ivory Coast to below 3,000
following a peace agreement signed by the government and rebel
forces, a military official said Thursday.


France currently has 3,500 troops in the country who have
operated alongside United Nations forces to patrol a buffer zone
dividing the rebel-controlled north and the government-led south.


Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo and rebel head Guillaume
Soro reached a peace deal earlier this month designed to lead to
the formation of an interim government and elections.


Soro led a 2002 abortive coup against Gbagbo, triggering a brief
civil war that left the west African country divided.


The peace agreement also calls for the scaling down of both UN
troops and French forces. The UN has some 7,000 troops in Ivory
Coast.


French Lieutenant Colonel Christian Rascle did not give specific
numbers in his announcement, but said the withdrawal to below
3,000 troops should occur within a couple of months.


In the meantime troops would be redeployed from the west of the
country to the centre, and in particular the commercial capital
of Abidjan and the political capital of Yamoussoukro, he told a
press conference.


The UN Security Council has extended the mandate for French
forces in Ivory Coast until June 30.


Rascle said the modifications to the French force, known as
Operation Unicorn, resulted from the improvements in the security
situation, and the planned elimination of the buffer zone and
formation of a unified national army.


"We are anticipating what is likely to happen in the next few
weeks," he said.
