European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes expressed concern
on Thursday that US software giant Microsoft was gaining market
share, even while failing to comply with an anti-trust ruling.


"Microsoft is constantly gaining market share and that is
worrying me," she told European parliamentarians.


The Commission, the EU's top competition regulator, says
Microsoft's Windows operating system held a 35-40 percent share
of the world market in 1999. This grew to 60 percent in 2003 and
70-75 percent currently.


In 2004, the Commission fined the company a record 497 million
euros (657 million dollars) for abuse of its dominant market
position.


It also ordered the Microsoft to sell a version of Windows
without Media Player software and to divulge the software
protocols underpinning Windows for makers of rival products.


Microsoft challenged the 2004 ruling in the EU's second-highest
court last April and the judges are expected to hand down a
decision in the first half of this year.


Frustrated with this defiance, the Commission last July slapped
daily fines adding up to 280.5 million euros over the six-month
period of the penalty for failing to fully respect the 2004
antitrust ruling.


Microsoft has paid that fine but is appealing against the
charges.


"After three years discussions, it needs to be clear cut, it is
not acceptable," Kroes said, adding that a resolution "hopefully
will happen this year."
