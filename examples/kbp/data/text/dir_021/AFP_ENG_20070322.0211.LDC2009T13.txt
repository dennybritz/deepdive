The Angolan embassy in Zimbabwe rejected Thursday as "completely
false" reports that the Angolan government would send 3,000
policemen to Zimbabwe to bolster the security forces there.


"This information is completely false," it said in a statement.


"It is not the custom of the Angolan government to interfere into
the internal matters of other governments."


The Times in London reported Thursday that about 2,500 Angolan
paramilitary police were to be deployed in Zimbabwe to boost the
security forces of President Robert Mugabe.
