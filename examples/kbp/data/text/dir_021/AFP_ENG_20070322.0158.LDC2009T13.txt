The head of a bank at the centre of Algeria's biggest ever
corruption scandal was sentenced in absentia Thursday to life in
prison.


Rafik Khalifa has been exiled in London since 2003, when hundreds
of millions of dollars was discovered missing from the Khalifa
Bank. Algeria has made repeated attempts to secure his
extradition.
