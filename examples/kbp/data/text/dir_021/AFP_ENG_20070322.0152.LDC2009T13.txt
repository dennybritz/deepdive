Japan's government on Thursday defended Foreign Minister Taro
Aso's suggestion that "yellow-faced" Japanese can play a better
role in the Middle East peace process than blond, blue-eyed
Westerners.


"Japan is doing what Americans can't do," Aso reportedly said in
a speech on Wednesday, referring to Tokyo's initiative to build a
business park to help ease the income gap between Palestinians
and Israelis.


"Japanese are trusted," the gaffe-prone minister said. "If you
have blue eyes and blond hair, it probably won't work.
Fortunately, we have yellow faces."


But Noriyuki Shikata, assistant press secretary with the foreign
ministry, said Aso had just wanted to stress Japan's neutrality
in the Middle East.


"It has nothing to do with racial matters," Shikata said.


Japan has close commercial relations with many Arab nations and
Iran -- it imports nearly all of its oil from the Middle East --
while building favorable ties with Israel.


Tokyo has been one of the largest contributors to the Palestinian
Authority since the landmark 1993 Oslo accords.


Aso has in the past shocked neighboring countries -- and liberals
at home -- by defending revisionists who seek to justify Japan's
past military aggression in Asia, and by hailing Japan's ethnic
homogeneity.
