The southern German city of Munich inaugurated a new Jewish
museum on Thursday, almost 70 years since the Nazis' crackdown on
Jews was taken to a new level here.


The museum is part of a new 71 million euro (91 million dollar)
Jewish complex which also includes a synagogue, school and
community centre.


The opening ceremony took place not at the museum but at the Old
City Hall where Joseph Goebbels gave the order on November 9,
1938, for Nazi thugs to rampage through Germany torching
synagogues, looting businesses and killing Jews in what became
known as Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass.


"Munich can once again be seen as a centre of Jewish life, the
practising of the Jewish religion, culture, tradition and a
Jewish future," Munich mayor Christian Ude said.


He said it was a "godsend" that, given its past, the Jewish
community in Germany had chosen Munich as the site of the centre.


The site of the synagogue was the target of a foiled plot by neo-
Nazis to bomb a ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone
in 2003.
