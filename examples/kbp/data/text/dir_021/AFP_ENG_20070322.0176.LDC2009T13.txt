Francois Bayrou, the centrist contender in France's presidential
race, showed the first sign of losing ground Thursday as an
opinion poll showed him dropping four points in first round
voting intentions.


The BVA survey for regional newspapers put Bayrou on 17 percent
-- down from 21 percent the previous week -- in the multi-
candidate first round of the election on April 22.


Right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy was up two points at 31
percent and the socialist Segolene Royal up one at 24 percent.
Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen had 13 percent.


The gap between Royal and Bayrou, which was just two points a
week ago, has thus opened up to seven, according to the poll.
Only two candidates qualify for the decisive second round of the
vote on May 6.


In the event of a Sarkozy-Royal run-off, Sarkozy -- of the ruling
Union for Popular Movement (UMP) -- would win by 54 percent to
46, according to BVA.


Bayrou, 55, of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), shot up in
the polls in recent weeks as voters expressed growing
disenchantment with the two main parties of left and right.


Several surveys suggested Bayrou can beat Sarkozy in a run-off,
opening up the chance of tactical first-round votes in his favour
if Royal-supporters decide he is the best hope of keeping out the
right-winger.
