Luxembourg champion Kim Kirchen will lead the T-Mobile charge at
Saturday's Milan-San Remo, the German team announced on Thursday.


Kirchen arrives in Milan, for the longest one-day race on the
calendar and the traditional season opener, fresh off a strong
ride and an excellent second place overall at this week's
traditional Milan-San Remo warm-up race.


"Kim is very much in form at the moment," says sporting director
Valerio Piva, who is banking on a "a big all-round team
performance" from his charges at the weekend.


Indeed, the seven-hour slog over the gruelling 294km course is
very much a team effort, and Kirchen will be supported by
distance specialists Lorenzo Bernucci, Andreas Klier, Jakob Piil,
Roger Hammond and Bert Grabsch.


T-Mobile team: Lorenzo Bernucci (ITA), Gerald Ciolek (GER),
Bernhard Eisel (AUT), Bert Grabsch (GER), Roger Hammond (GBR),
Kim Kirchen (LUX), Andreas Klier (GER), Jakob Piil (DEN).
