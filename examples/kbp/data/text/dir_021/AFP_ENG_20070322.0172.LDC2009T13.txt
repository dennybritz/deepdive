Heavy fighting broke out Thursday in previously calm northern
neighbourhoods of the Somali capital as Somali-Ethiopian forces
exchanged mortar and machine gun fire with insurgents.


"Heavy artillery shells are being used by the government forces
and the rebels. We are inside our houses and very scared. There
are stray bullets everywhere," said Bashir Mohamed, a resident of
the northern Gupta neighbourhood.


An AFP correspondent said he saw two Ethiopian tanks rumbling
towards other fighting in southern Wadajir neighbourhood.
