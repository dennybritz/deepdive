Romania is to set up support centres for children whose parents
have gone abroad to look for work leaving friends or family to
take care of them, local media reported Thursday.


Authorities have allocated some 1.27 million lei (about 382,000
euros, 510,000 dollars) to this project, Labour Minister Gheorghe
Barbu was cited as saying in the daily Evenimentul Zilei.


The children will be accommodated in support and counseling
centres as part of a larger government programme to protect
minors.


Some 39,900 Romanian children currently have parents seeking work
abroad, according to recent figures from the National Authority
for the Protection of Children's Rights.


Most of them were left in the care of relatives or neighbours but
290 were placed in public or private centres.


The press has often reported on children being mistreated or
neglected by their guardians as well as on cases of minors
committing suicide because of their parents' absence.


Following the 1989 revolution, Romania saw widespread emigration,
with some two million nationals leaving the country to find a
well-paid job, often in European Union countries, especially
Italy and Spain.
