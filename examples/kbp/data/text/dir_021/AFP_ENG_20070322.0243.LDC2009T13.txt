Sri Lanka turned down a Buddhist monk who wanted to become an
assistant superintendent of police because he would not shed his
saffron robes in exchange for a uniform, an official said
Thursday.


The unidentified monk, who had graduated from a Sri Lankan
university, was among 2,200 applicants for the police post, but
failed to meet the basic criteria, the National Police Commission
(NPC) said.


"The monk's application was rejected because he was not prepared
to give up the robes," the commission's secretary K. C.
Logeswaran told AFP. "One of the basic requirements is that you
should be able to wear the khaki uniform."


Several monks have joined Sri Lanka's security forces after
giving up their robes in this mainly Buddhist nation of 19.5
million people.


Monks are also employed by the state as teachers.
