Shots were fired Thursday morning near the home of the ex-vice
president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jean-Pierre Bemba,
in an area where the army had recently stepped up its presence,
an AFP correspondent in Kinshasa said.


The sounds of automatic weapons fire were followed by that of
heavy weapons.


Dozens of soldiers and UN armoured vehicles were deployed outside
Bemba's residence on Tuesday amid fears of clashes with his
security guards.


Bemba and Azarias Ruberwa, whose rebel movements battled Kinshasa
until 2003, were vice-presidents during a post-war transition to
democratic rule overseen by the United Nations.


The transition process ended last year with the first democratic
elections in more than four decades. Joseph Kabila was
inaugurated as president in December.
