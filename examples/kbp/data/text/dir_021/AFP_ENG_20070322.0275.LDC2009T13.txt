An Indonesian boxer who died after sustaining a brain injury
during a televised bout was in good shape ahead of the fight, his
coach said Thursday.


Anis Dwi Mulya, 27, died in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, on
Tuesday, five days after an emergency operation on a brain
hemorrhage, although the neurosurgeon who treated him said dengue
fever was the cause of death.


"He was fit for fighting. For the four months in my training,
Anis was never sick, save for a brief cold in the first month,"
Mulya's coach, Jumain Doper, told AFP.


"The fight was very intense from the first round and I brought it
to a halt in the sixth round after seeing that my fighter was
unable to continue," said Doper, who is also a doctor.


Mulya complained of headaches after losing the junior
featherweight contest on a technical knockout and was later
rushed to hospital for the operation.


But Tunggul Marpaung, the neurosurgeon who treated Mulya, told
state media that dengue fever -- revealed by the fighter's
falling blood count in the days after the operation -- rather
than the head injury killed the boxer.


Mulya's body was flown to his home town of Mojokerto in East Java
for burial.
