Marcello Lippi, who quit as Italy coach after leading them to
triumph at last year's World Cup, on Thursday dismissed Italian
media reports that he could be on his way to English champions
Chelsea.


Lippi has been taking things easy since the Azzurri's success,
and said he was in no rush to get back to coaching.


"I have been contacted by some foreign clubs, but Chelsea is not
one of them," he told Italian news agency ANSA.


"I haven't received any offers from Italian clubs, but at the
moment I don't feel any real urge to get back to the bench.


"I have never said that I will be coaching again next season, and
maybe I will do nothing for another year."


According to Thursday's Gazzetta dello Sport, Lippi is seen by
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as the ideal replacement for Jose
Mourinho should the Portuguese coach leave the London club at the
end of the season.
