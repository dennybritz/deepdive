Former Scotland skipper Jon Petrie has decided to retire from
rugby at the end of the season following his serious shoulder
injury late last year.


The Glasgow Warriors skipper made his Scotland debut against New
Zealand in 2000 and is to leave rugby for a new career in the
energy sector.


Flanker Petrie, 30, won 45 caps for Scotland and had a short
stint as captain after Frank Hadden's appointment as head coach
in September 2005.


Petrie's tenure was ended by the injury which forced him out of
the 2005 autumn internationals.


He said: "Pro rugby has been my whole life for the past 10 years
or so and is a difficult thing to let go of.


"I've had some fantastic times with Glasgow, and with Scotland,
but I have a gut feeling that now is the right time to move on to
something new.


"I'd like to thank everybody for the support that I've been given
throughout my career, especially the fans here in Glasgow, who
have always been great to me."
