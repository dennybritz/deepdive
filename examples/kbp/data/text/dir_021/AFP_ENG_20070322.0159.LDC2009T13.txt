UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Baghdad on Thursday,
flying into Iraq on a previously unannounced visit for talks with
Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki, local UN spokesman Said Erekat
said.


Ban's arrival was the unannounced first leg of an 11-day Middle
East tour previously announced at the United Nations headquarters
in New York.


"He will be meeting Prime Minister (Nuri al-) Maliki and other
government officials," Erekat said, confirming the UN chief's
arrival.


"He will be meeting with parliament members and he will be
meeting different political groups' leaderships and the
diplomatic corps. He will be discussing recent events in Iraq,
the role the United Nations has," he added.
