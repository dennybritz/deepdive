Hamburg coach Huub Stevens was on Thursday excused all duties for
this weekend so he can return to his home in Holland to nurse his
sick wife.


The 53-year-old Dutchman took over at Hamburg in February and has
dashed to be beside his wife Toos, who has had an emergency
operation for a chronic intestinal problem, but is expected to be
back with the club next week.


Stevens' assistant Markus Schupp will take over at this weekend's
training with no Bundesliga games owing to Germany's Euro 2008
qualifier against the Czech Republic in Prague.


Stevens quit as Cologne coach in 2005 after his wife had other
health problems.
