Centuries from Luke Butterworth and Sean Clingeleffer have put
Tasmania in an impregnable position to win their first-ever
Australian Sheffield Shield cricket title against New South
Wales.


At stumps on the fourth day in the five-day final at Bellerive
Oval Thursday, NSW were three without loss and chasing a massive
567 runs to pull off an improbable win on Friday's final day.


Young allrounder Butterworth hit a glorious 106 and veteran
wicketkeeper Clingeleffer scored 107 to give the Tasmanians a
seemingly unbeatable 570-run lead after their second innings.


It was Butterworth scoring his maiden century in only his fifth
Shield game that broke NSW's spirit.


Tasmania were bowled out for 460 in their second innings after
resuming on Thursday at 203 for six, before NSW reached three
without loss by stumps.


Tasmania only need a draw to grab a maiden Shield title in their
25th  season, while NSW require outright victory to seal a 45th
domestic title.
