Queen Elizabeth is to attend one of the United States' premier
horse races, the Kentucky Derby, when she visits the country in
May, her office said Thursday.


The 80-year-old monarch, who will be on a state visit to the
United States from May 3 to May 8, will be at the first of the
Triple Crown events on May 5 with her husband, Prince Philip Duke
of Edinburgh, Buckingham Palace said.


The queen is a lifelong racing fan and still a keen horsewoman,
despite her advancing years. She and the duke, 85, are a regular
fixture at the annual Epsom Derby and Royal Ascot flat racing
events in Britain.


Royal officials said she will be in Virginia from May 3 to May 4
to mark the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement, where
English migrants landed in 1607 and established the first
successful English colony in the New World.


She and her husband will be in Washington DC from May 6 to May 8
for a visit hosted by US President George W. Bush.


Queen Elizabeth announced the trip at the state opening of
parliament in November last year but this is the first time the
itinerary has been announced.


The queen and Prince Philip, who celebrate their 60th wedding
anniversary this year, have made three state visits to the United
States: in 1957, 1976 for the US bicentennial celebrations and in
1991.


There was also an official visit to the US west coast in 1983.


She met presidents John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan,
George Bush senior, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush when they
visited Britain.
