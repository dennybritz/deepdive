Horst R. Schmidt, the man responsible for ensuring the 2010 World
Cup runs smoothly, said the South African organisers were 'on
schedule', quashing rumours the event was running into problems.


The 65-year-old, the vice-president of the 2006 World Cup's
organising committee, said he had no doubts the event would be a
success.


"It's clear to me that the South African event will be well-
organised," Schmidt told Thursday's German daily Tagesspiegel,
quashing rumours the event was hitting building and renovation
problems.


"There were certainly some difficulties initially in the building
of stadiums, but now everything is on schedule.


"I do not doubt for a second that the World Cup will take place
in South Africa, it will be a different World Cup from the one
which took place last summer in Germany, but it will certainly
not be any less impressive," added Schmidt, who is also general
secretary of the German Football Federation (DFB).
