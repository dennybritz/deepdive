A portable laboratory the size of a small TV set that can perform
quick autopsies on dead birds to detect diseases such as avian
flu will be operational by the end of the year, experts say.


Speaking of a "small revolution in the fight against avian flu,"
the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said in a
statement that the apparatus would "shorten the time for
detecting the virus of this disease or other animal diseases"
such as foot-and-mouth disease and Rift Valley fever.


The lab "can be adapted to recognise different strains of bird
flu, notably H5N1 (and) with a little training, anyone can use
this portable machine," the Rome- based FAO said.


The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is
developing the lab jointly with the FAO, told AFP that it was
still in an "experimental stage," but would come on stream by the
end of 2007.


It will initially cost some 750 euros (1,000 dollars).


FAO said farmers "will thus be able to carry out tests and send
the results to a coordination centre in the same way as mobile
phone SMS messages."


The lab uses the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) procedure, which
reads a small chunk of DNA and produces a diagnosis in a few
hours.


The joint FAO-IAEA project has a budget of 500,000 dollars
(375,000 euros).
