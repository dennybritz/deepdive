Armed bandits shot and wounded two US tourists and their tour
guide outside a national park in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha, police said Thursday.


Two armed robbers ambushed the trio as they left their hotel
outside Tarangire National Park on Wednesday, shot them and stole
their personal belongings, said Arusha regional police commander
Evarist Mangala.


The injured tourists were flown to Nairobi for treatment while
their guide was admitted to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical
Centre "in a critical condition", Mangala said.


President Jakaya Kikwete, who was touring Arusha, directed
regional police to track down the bandits and bring them to
justice.


The incident comes nearly three weeks after four people of Somali
origin armed with AK-47 assault rifles ambushed and robbed a
group of tourists in a remote border area near the Ngorongoro
volcanic crater.
