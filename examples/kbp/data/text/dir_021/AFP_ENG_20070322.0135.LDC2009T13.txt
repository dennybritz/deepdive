The death toll from a bus accident in Thailand rose to 30 after
another victim succumbed to their injuries, government officials
said Thursday.


Dozens of people were also wounded when a passenger bus burst
into flames and careered down a hillside in central Thailand on
Tuesday. Officials said 23 people were still receiving treatment,
and eight remained in comas.


Authorities blamed the bus inferno on human error and mechanical
malfunction. Transport Company, which runs the bus, has suspended
its service for one week.


The Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department (DPMD) said
initial reports found that the bus' braking system was broken,
and the driver had instead changed gears to slow the vehicle,
which caused the deadly fire.


The bus was travelling from the northeastern province of
Yasothorn toward Bangkok when it caught fire in the central
province of Saraburi, about 105 kilometres (65 miles) north of
the capital.


Relatives of the dead will each receive 400,000 baht (11,547
dollars) in compensation from the insurance company, while the
injured will get 250,000 baht, the DPMD said in a statement.
