Commercial negotiations are under way and the Singapore
government is prepared to offer support for hosting a Formula One
race in the city-state, a cabinet minister said Thursday.


Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's Second Minister for Information,
Communications and the Arts, declined to reveal details of the
talks.


"Commercial negotiations are ongoing and in all these commercial
transactions you don't really want to show all your cards," he
said.


"Some government support will be necessary and we have indicated
to the private parties concerned that some support is available,"
he told the Foreign Correspondents Association.


The Straits Times newspaper reported last week that Formula One
supremo Bernie Ecclestone held talks in Singapore with a tycoon
who is bidding for the right to host a new F1 race in the island
nation.


The report said Ecclestone was believed to have had dinner with
Singapore hotel magnate Ong Beng Seng, one of two local parties
jockeying to host the F1 event.


Minister of State for Trade and Industry S. Iswaran earlier told
parliament the country was taking a "very serious look" at
hosting an F1 race.


Neighbouring Malaysia is to host a Formula One race at Sepang
next month. It also is home to A1 and MotoGP races.


Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew said two years ago that
he regretted not having built a Formula One race track to
generate more money for the local economy.
