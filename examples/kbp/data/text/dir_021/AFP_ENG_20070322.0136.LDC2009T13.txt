The head of Lithuania's music television channel MTV has been
fined by the country's media watchdog for broadcasting the
"Popetown" series, an official said Thursday.


"The Radio and Television Commission voted unanimously to impose
the maximum fine of 3,000 litas (868.8 euros) on Marius Veselis,"
a spokesman for the commission, Audrius Matonis, told AFP.


"We warned MTV that the series may be seen as controversial in
our society before they started broadcasting it, but MTV Lietuva
decided to show it anyway," Matonis added.


"Popetown" is described on the Internet as a series that "takes
you into the side-splittingly surreal world of the Vatican as the
long suffering and good- hearted Father Nicholas struggles to
walk the narrow path of righteousness, surrounded by money-
grabbing cardinals and a pogo-stick-riding infantile pope."


Matonis said the Radio and Television Commission had taken its
decision based on the conclusions of Lithuania's journalists'
ethics inspector, who has decided that "Popetown" incites hatred
against the Church and could have a negative influence on younger
viewers.


The commission did not discuss whether the series should be
banned from the air, he added.


MTV spokeswoman Ema Segal said in a statement that the channel
will appeal the commission's decision, just as it has appealed
the decision of the ethics inspector.
