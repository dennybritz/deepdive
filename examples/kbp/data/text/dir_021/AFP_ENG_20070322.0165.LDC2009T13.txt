The European Union accused the United States of giving about 23.7
billion dollars (18 billion euros) in non-repayable aid to
aircraft maker Boeing since 1990, in evidence to a WTO disputes
panel on Thursday.


The EU estimated that the US administration had given Boeing 18.9
billion dollars in the form of aid for research and development
and tax relief from 1990 to 2004 and that several federal states
had provided 4.8 billion dollars.


The information emerged from a summary of written complaints by
the European Commission in Brussels.


The EU and US have been at loggerheads for years over charges and
counter- charges that each provides state aid to its main
aircraft maker, Boeing in the United States and Airbus in Europe,
in breach of World Trade Organization fair- trading principles.
