A small fire broke out Thursday aboard a Norwegian ferry carrying
346 passengers from Norway to Denmark, forcing passengers to
evacuate their cabins, ferry company Color Line said.


"At no time was the security of the passengers, the crew or the
ship in question," Color Line said in a statement.


The fire, which broke out in an electrical cabinet when the
vessel was 12 nautical miles from its destination Hirtshals, was
quickly brought under control, the company said.


In line with security regulations, passengers were ordered to
gather in the ship's dining area.


The ferry was rerouted to the Danish port of Frederikshavn,
escorted by a Danish navy corvette.
