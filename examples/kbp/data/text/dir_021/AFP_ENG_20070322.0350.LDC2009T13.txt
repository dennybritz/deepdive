German team manager Oliver Bierhoff confirmed on Thursday that
Germany will play England in the first full international at the
new Wembley Stadium on August 22.


The meeting between the two classic international rivals mirrors
the last international played at Wembley when Germany beat
England 1-0 on October 7 2000 and 90,000 fans are expected for
the grand unveiling in August.


"We are glad to be involved in the first international at the new
Wembley," said Bierhoff, with England set to play their first
Under-21 international at the new stadium against Italy this
weekend.
