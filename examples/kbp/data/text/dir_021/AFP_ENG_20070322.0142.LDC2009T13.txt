Riot police were deployed Thursday to quell clashes which erupted
over land in Nigeria's southwestern state of Ondo, the police
said.


"We have deplored our men to contain the violence which broke out
in Ikare-Akoka on Wednesday. The fighting was between two
families contesting the ownership of a piece of land," a senior
police officer told AFP.


He said weapons such as guns, knives, planks, iron rods were
freely used by the fighting families who had an age-long dispute
over the land.


"We are happy that peace has returned to the troubled town after
our intervention," he added.


Disputes over ownership of land are common among Nigeria's
communities and families.


Last month, at least 10 people were killed and more than 200
houses razed in southern Nigeria's Ogoniland in a similar
incident.


Oil-rich Ogoniland is a hotbed of civil unrest in the restive
Niger Delta, home to Nigeria's multi-billion-dollar oil and gas
resources.


Community unrest forced Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell, Nigeria's
major oil operator, out of Ogoniland in 1993 and the company has
yet to return there.
