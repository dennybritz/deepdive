International efforts to end North Korea's nuclear weapons
programme remain on track despite the suspension of six-nation
negotiations here on Thursday, the chief US envoy said.


"The six-party process continues to be on track," Christopher
Hill told reporters. "It is our strong view that we are on
schedule to meet the 60-day requirement."


Under a six-nation accord signed on February 13, North Korea said
it would shut down its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and allow
UN atomic inspectors back into the country within 60 days.


In return, the impoverished North Korea would receive 50,000
tonnes of fuel for energy use.


The latest round of six-nation talks began on Monday amid high
hopes major progress would be made in cementing the accord after
the United States said it would allow the return of 25 million
dollars of frozen North Korean assets.


But North Korea refused to negotiate until the cash, which had
been frozen in a Macau bank due to US accusations of money
laundering and counterfeiting, was safely back in its coffers.


By late Thursday the cash had still not been transferred to a
North Korean account at the Bank of China in Beijing, and
Pyongyang's envoy in the Chinese capital boarded a plane and flew
home.


At the same time, a senior Bank of China official said it had not
yet been asked to get involved in any transfer.


North Korea, which conducted its first atomic weapons test in
October last year, would eventually receive one million tonnes of
heavy fuel or equivalent energy aid if it permanently dismantled
its nuclear weapons programme.
