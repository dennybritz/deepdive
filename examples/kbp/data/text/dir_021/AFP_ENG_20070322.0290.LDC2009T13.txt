France will soon reduce its forces in the Ivory Coast to below
3,000 following a peace agreement signed by the government and
rebel forces, a military official said Thursday.


France currently has 3,500 troops in the country who have
operated alongside United Nations forces to patrol a buffer zone
dividing the rebel-controlled north and the government-led south.


Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo and rebel head Guillaume
Soro reached a peace deal earlier this month designed to lead to
the formation of an interim government and elections.


Soro led a 2002 abortive coup against Gbagbo, triggering the
brief civil war that divided the country into two zones.


The peace agreement also calls for the scaling down of both UN
troops and French forces. The UN has some 7,000 troops in the
Ivory Coast.


French Lieutenant Colonel Christian Rascle did not give specific
numbers in his announcement, but said the withdrawal to below
3,000 troops should occur within a couple months.


The UN Security Council has extended the mandate for French
forces in the Ivory Coast until June 30.
