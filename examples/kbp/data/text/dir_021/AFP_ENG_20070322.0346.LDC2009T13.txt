US mathematician of Indian origin Srinivasa Varadhan won the
prestigious Abel prize for his work on probabilities, the jury
announced Thursday.


The prize honoured in particular his work on "a unified theory of
large deviations," or the study of the occurrence of rare events.


Varadhan, 67, is a professor at New York University's Courant
Institute of Mathematical Sciences.


"Varadhan's work has great conceptual strength and ageless
beauty," the jury appointed by Norway's science academy, said.


"His ideas have been hugely influential and will continue to
stimulate further research for a long time."


The Abel prize, worth six million kronor (545,325 euros, 864,450
dollars), was created by Norway's government in 2002 to mark the
200th anniversary of the birth of the great Norwegian
mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.


It is viewed as the equivalent of a Nobel prize, which is not
awarded for mathematics.


The elder of Varadhan's two sons, Gopal, was killed in the
attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.
