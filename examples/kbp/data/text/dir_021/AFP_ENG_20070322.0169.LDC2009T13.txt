China said Thursday that two French presidential candidates who
suggested the country should boycott the Beijing Olympics over
Darfur misunderstood China's position on the issue.


Segolene Royal and Francois Bayrou -- second and third in the
opinion polls  -- offered support for an Olympic boycott during a
public meeting on the Darfur crisis in Paris on Tuesday evening.


"The people who put forward such a proposal are not very clear on
China's position on the Darfur issue," China's foreign ministry
spokesman Liu Jianchao told journalists.


Bayrou, of the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF), said
that if Beijing continued to block UN Security Council
resolutions condemning Sudan, then "France will do itself honour
by refusing to take part in the (2008) Olympic Games."


Liu said China had urged the Sudanese government to accept
international peacekeepers to the troubled Darfur region, but
also reiterated Beijing's position that such a move must be
agreed to by Khartoum.


Royal, who is the Socialist Party (PS) candidate, said that "it
is time to end the culpable inertia of France's Africa policy."


"They say that the Chinese will oppose all sanctions (against
Sudan). Now is the moment to put on the pressure, ahead of the
Beijing Olympic Games," she said.


China is Sudan's most important international ally. It buys some
60 percent of Sudan's oil exports and has used its veto to block
resolutions condemning Khartoum in the UN Security Council.


Fighting between rebels and armed pro-government groups in Darfur
has killed 200,000 people and displaced more than two million in
the past four years, according to the UN.
