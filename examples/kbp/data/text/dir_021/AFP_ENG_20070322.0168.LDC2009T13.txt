North Korean nuclear disarmament talks were suspended on
Thursday, the Chinese government said in a statement, following
four days of deadlock in negotiations.


"The parties agreed to recess and will resume the talks at the
earliest opportunity to continue to discuss and formulate an
action plan for the next phase," the statement said.
