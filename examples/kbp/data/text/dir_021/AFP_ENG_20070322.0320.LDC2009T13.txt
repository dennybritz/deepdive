Korean teenager Na Da-ye shot a level-par 72 to hold a narrow
one-shot lead going into the last round of the season-ending
Binhai Ladies Open here on Thursday.


Na posted four birdies against four bogeys on a day when none of
the 133 players were able to shoot below-par scores due to strong
chilly winds.


With a two-round total of 146, she leads countrywoman Ham Young-
ae who is alone in second with Ji Eun-hee a shot further back in
third.


"I know this course is very challenging and demands a lot of
thinking. It's for the smart players not for brawny players," she
Na, adding that the winds were not a problem to her.


"Coming from Jeju Island where the winds are very strong, I'm
used to playing under the cold and windy conditions."


Overnight leader Shang Linyan, who hit out at the referee after
her group was cautioned for slow play, returned a seven-over 79
to tally 149, three shots off the pace.


Shang shares fourth position with compatriot Wu Qunfang, Korean
Kim Hae-jun and Taiwan's Shih Huei Ju and Yu Pei Lin, and said
she was determined to become the Ladies Asian Golf Tour's first
Chinese winner.


"We've not had a winner on the Ladies Asian Golf Tour. I'm only
three-strokes adrift from the leader. This is my best chance to
get a Chinese victory," she said.


A total of 71 players made the cut for Friday's final round in
the 230,000-dollar tournament.
