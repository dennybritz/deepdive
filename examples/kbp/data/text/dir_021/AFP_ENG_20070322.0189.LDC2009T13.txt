Three more American soldiers have been killed in separate
incidents in Iraq, where a US-led force is battling a violent
insurgency, the military said on Thursday.


One soldier was killed on Wednesday when gunmen ambushed his
combat patrol during an ongoing American-led security operation
in Baghdad, according to statements from the US military.


The soldier died when the patrol was attacked with small arms
fire in a western district of the war-torn Iraqi capital, it
said.


Two more troops -- a marine and an army soldier -- were also
killed on Wednesday "while conducting combat operations in Al-
Anbar province" of western Iraq.


The latest deaths brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 20 invasion just over four years ago to 3,225,
according to an AFP tally based on Pentagon figures.
