Brian Joubert was crowned men's singles champion at the world
figure skating championships on Thursday, bringing the title to
France for the first time in 42 years.


The 22-year-old European champion, who took world silver in 2004
and 2006, finally finished on top after an error-free performance
for 157.21 points in the free skating, giving him a total of
240.85 points.


It was the first victory in the category for France since Alain
Calmar won the gold medal in 1965.


Japanese national champion Daisuke Takahashi marked the best
score in the free skating to finish second, with two-time
defending champion Stephane Lambiel of Switzerland taking bronze.


Takahashi, although touching the ice at his first quadruple
attempt, collected 163.44 points to move up from Wednesday's
third with a total of 237.95 points.


Lambiel also touched the ice on a quadruple, but ended with
excellent high-speed combination spins to earn 160.65 points for
a total of 233.35 points.


Turin Olympic bronze medallist Jeffrey Buttle, second after the
short programme, fell twice and touched the ice once in a
disastrous performance which left him sixth with 214.96 points.


Two-time world bronze medallist Evan Lysacek of the United States
was fifth with 222.18 points, while local hope Nobunari Oda was
seventh with 209.94.
