The head of a bank at the centre of Algeria's biggest ever
corruption scandal was sentenced in absentia Thursday to life in
prison.


Rafik Khalifa has been exiled in London since 2003, when hundreds
of millions of dollars was discovered missing from the Khalifa
Bank. Algeria has made repeated attempts to secure his
extradition.


The court in Blida, southern Algeria, sentenced him to life in
prison for fraud, embezzlement, theft, forgery and other charges.


The exiled former governor of the central bank, Abdelawahab
Keramane, and five others were also sentenced in abstentia to 20
years in prison.


Khalifa's wife received a 10-year sentence, as did former
industry minister Abdennour Keramane and his daughter Yasmine,
the former representative of Khalifa Airways in Milan, Italy.


The court ordered the seizure of the assets of all those
convicted.
