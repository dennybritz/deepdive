The European Commission on Thursday announced it would take
Greece to court over its failure to liberalise its broadcasting
services, seeking heavy fines as punishment.


"The European Commission has decided to refer Greece to the
European Court of Justice for failure to fully comply with the
court's ruling of April 14, 2005," the EU's executive arm said in
a statement.


That ruling confirmed that Greece had failed to implement EU
competition law for its television and radio services,
particularly digital broadcasting.


The Commission is therefore referring Greece back to the court,
seeking fines, consisting of daily lump sums totalling 48,442.80
euros for Greece's continued infringement.


"In the absence of a national regulatory framework for
broadcasting transmission services, companies will not invest in
Greece, in particular in digital broadcasting," EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.


"Open and non-discriminatory access for broadcasters to these
services is essential for the development and consolidation of
digital broadcasting. For too long now Greek consumers have been
deprived of the benefits the digital economy is expected to bring
about".


A 2002 EU directive aims at ensuring that competitive market
conditions prevail across the European Union in electronic
communications networks and services.


All member states except Greece have notified measures to
implement it.
