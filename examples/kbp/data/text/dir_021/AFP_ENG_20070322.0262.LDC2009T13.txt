Police arrested 22 people in London during raids which they said
Thursday were part of a major crackdown on fake passport scams
and illegal immigration.


More than 100 police officers were involved in the raids in 12
areas of the British capital throughout Wednesday, the
Metropolitan Police said in a statement.


False passports, driving licences, foreign identity documents
from Italy, Portugal, Spain, Russia and Lithuania plus about
40,000 pounds (59,000 euros, 79,000 dollars) in cash were also
recovered.


The operation -- codenamed "Greenhill" -- came a day after
Britain's Home Office admitted that 10,000 passports were wrongly
given out last year by its officials, including to two men
convicted of terrorist offences.


The ministry then announced it was to interview all applicants to
combat the problem.


Britain is hoping to introduce identity cards for the first time
since World War II. The government says it will help tackle
terrorism and illegal immigration but there is strong opposition
from civil liberties groups.


Nineteen of those arrested Wednesday were detained for crimes
including possession and conspiracy to produce and distribute
false documents. The other three were dealt with for immigration
offences.
