Wall Street stocks opened little changed Thursday as the market
digested a powerful rally a day earlier fueled by what some
analysts said was a Fed hint of an easier money policy soon.


In opening trades, the Down Jones Industrial Average edged up
3.53 points (0.03 percent) to 12,451.05 after a big 1.3 percent
gain on Wednesday.


The Nasdaq composite dipped a fractional 0.54 points (0.02
percent) to 2,455.38 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's
500 added 0.39 points (0.03 percent) to 1,435.43.


The market was consolidating a day after shooting higher in the
wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates steady. The
central bank eliminated a reference to "firming" or hiking rates
in its latest policy statement.


"The market's rally yesterday in response to the Fed policy
statement was overdone," said Dick Green at Briefing.com.


"The statement did remove the bias towards tightening, but there
was no hint of any rate cut soon. It was modestly positive news
at best."


Green said sentiment swings have been extreme in the past few
weeks, and now investors may be too optimistic about rate cuts.


"The overly pessimistic view based on the Shanghai market plunge
(in late February) and the rising (US) delinquency rates on
subprime mortgages quickly vanished amidst unfounded confidence
that the Fed will soon cut rates.


"It is easy to get whip-sawed in this type of environment."
