A majority of Israelis would support their government having
contacts with the new Palestinian unity cabinet led by the
Islamist movement movement, in a poll broadcast on public radio
on Thursday.


When asked whether the Israeli government should have regular
contacts with the unity cabinet, 52 percent of Israelis said yes,
compared with 36 percent who said no, and the rest being without
opinion.


The Israeli government has refused to recognise the Palestinian
cabinet inaugurated on Saturday until it agrees to recognise the
Jewish state's right to exist, renounce violence and agree to
abide by past peace deals.


The new cabinet unites Hamas, which is considered a terror group
in Israel and the West, with moderate president Mahmud Abbas's
Fatah party and independents.


Thursday's poll questioned 534 people and had a 4.5 percent
margin of error.
