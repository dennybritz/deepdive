NATO forces in Bosnia conducted raids Thursday in search of
Stojan Zupljanin, one of six Serbs wanted by the UN war crimes
tribunal.


The operation targetted Slobodan Zupljanin, a cousin of the
fugitive wanted in relation to the torture, cruel treatment and
inhumane acts against Muslims and Croats during Bosnia's
1992-1995 war.


NATO troops backed by local police searched his Sarajevo home and
offices before questioning the former Bosnian Serb minister who
heads the country's trade chamber.


The operation, which began shortly after midnight, was carried
out "in an effort to find additional information about Stojan
Zupljanin's support network and ... to determine his location,"
NATO said.


"Slobodan Zupljanin was cooperative. We interviewed him in his
flat and took two boxes of items from the location," said NATO
spokesman Derek Chappell.


It was the second such raid on properties belonging to Slobodan
Zupljanin within weeks after Bosnian Serb police searched his
trading company and hotel in the northern town of Banja Luka on
March 7.


Stojan Zupljanin, 55, was a close associate to wartime Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who also remains at large more than
11 years since being indicted for genocide by the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.


The ICTY's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, said recently that
Zupljanin was hiding in Bosnia.
