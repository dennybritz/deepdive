European football's governing body on Thursday rejected a request
by Spanish club Sevilla to change the date of their UEFA Cup
quarter final, first leg against Tottenham on April 5.


Sevilla had been seeking to shift the home leg because it is
scheduled on Maundy Thursday, in the midst of a religious
festival in Spain.


UEFA said on its website that it had consistently declined
similar requests from other clubs, and alternative dates were
occupied.


The return match is due a week later at Tottenham's White Hart
Lane ground.
