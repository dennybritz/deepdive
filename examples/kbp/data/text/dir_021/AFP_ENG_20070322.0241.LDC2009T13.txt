US and coalition forces have arrested the ringleaders of an
attack in which five American soldiers were kidnapped and killed
in Iraq, the military said Thursday.


On January 20, gunmen disguised in US army uniforms breezed past
security checks and attacked a provincial security building in
the Karbala province of central Iraq during a visit by American
troops to their Iraqi counterparts.


One US soldier died in the assault, and four were captured. Their
slain bodies were later found with the attackers, abandoned SUV
vehicles, disguises and US- style weapons and radios.


It was not the most deadly attack on US troops in the four-year
war, but it was one of the most sophisticated and carefully
planned, leading some reports to speculate about complicity
within the Iraqi forces.


Thursday's statement said that in recent days coalition forces
had arrested Qais Khazali and Laith Khazali in the Shiite cities
of Hilla and Basra along with "several other members of the
Khazali network".


The statement described this group as being "directly connected
to the kidnapping and murder in January of five American soldiers
in Karbala", without offering any further details.
