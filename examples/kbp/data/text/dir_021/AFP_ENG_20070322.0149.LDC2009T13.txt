Riot police were deployed Thursday after five people were killed
in clashes over land in Nigeria's southwestern state of Ondo, the
police said.


"We have deployed our men to contain the violence which broke out
in Ikare-Akoka on Wednesday. The fighting was between two
families contesting the ownership of a piece of land," a senior
police officer told AFP.


"Five people lost their lives in the incident, while 15 others
sustained injuries," the officer said.


He said weapons such as guns, knives, planks, iron rods were used
by the fighting families who had an age-long dispute over the
land.


"We are happy that peace has returned to the troubled town after
our intervention," he added.


Land disputes are common in Nigeria. Last month at least 10
people were killed and more than 200 houses razed in southern
Nigeria's Ogoniland in a similar incident.


Oil-rich Ogoniland is a hotbed of civil unrest in the restive
Niger Delta, home to Nigeria's multi-billion-dollar oil and gas
resources.


Community unrest forced Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell, Nigeria's
major oil operator, out of Ogoniland in 1993 and the company has
yet to return there.
