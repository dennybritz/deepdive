The United States has seized more than 19 tonnes of cocaine off
the coast of Panama -- a record haul in a maritime anti-narcotics
operation, officials said.


Two US Coast Guard cutters intercepted a Panamian-flagged ship on
Sunday about 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Panama coast, said
Admiral Thad Allen, head of the US Coast Guard. It had first been
spotted the previous day.


US authorities searched the ship and found more than 42,000
pounds (19,000 kilogrammes) of cocaine in two containers, Allen
told reporters.


Karen Tandy, Drug Enforcement Administration administrator, said
the haul was intended for Mexican traffickers and had a street
value of about 600 million dollars.


Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said it was "the
largest maritime cocaine seizure in our nation's history, and I
think what may be certainly among the top, if not the top,
seizures ever in the nation's history."


Chertoff praised Panama for its assistance.


Panama and other Central American countries are common transit
points for US- bound drugs from South America, particularly
Colombia.
