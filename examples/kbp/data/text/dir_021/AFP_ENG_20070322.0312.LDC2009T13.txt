An explosion rocked Baghdad's fortified Green Zone on Thursday as
Ban Ki-moon held a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki, causing the UN chief to flinch.


After a brief pause, both men continued to take questions at an
event marking Ban's first visit to the Iraqi capital.


The loud blast sent a column of smoke and dust into the sky near
the northern edge of the Green Zone, opposite the Jumhuriyah
Bridge in downtown Baghdad in a heavily policed area surrounded
by government offices.
