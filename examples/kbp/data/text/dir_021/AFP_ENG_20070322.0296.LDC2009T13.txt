The outgoing US ambasador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, who is the
White House's nominee as ambassador to the United Nations, said
on Thursday he would soon be heading home.


"This will be the last time I will be visiting you as ambassador.
I will be leaving Iraq in a few days," Khalilzad told an audience
of dignitaries in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil, capital of
the Kurdish autonomous region.


In January, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced that
Khalilzad would be replaced in Baghdad by veteran US diplomat
Ryan Crocker and be named US envoy to the United Nations.


Khalilzad, 55, a native of Afghanistan and a Sunni Muslim, has
served in Iraq since June 2005 and played a key role in
negotiations over the new Iraqi constitution and the formation of
the governing coalition.


If approved by the US Senate, he will replace the controversial
John Bolton, who resigned the post in December after failing to
secure necessary Congressional endorsement.


Like Bolton, Khalilzad is often spoken of as being close to the
influential neo- conservative school of US foreign policy, whose
proponents are credited with the US-led invasion of Iraq and its
bloody aftermath.
