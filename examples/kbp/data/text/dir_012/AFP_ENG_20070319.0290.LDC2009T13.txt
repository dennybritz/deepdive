A luxury mansion on the French Riviera bought by a top aide of
Saddam Hussein and used as a bolthole by his feared elder son
Uday has been surrendered to the Iraqi authorities, the
government said Monday.


The lavish estate in Cannes, locally nicknamed Saddam's Villa
even though the executed president never stayed there, has been
ceded to the Iraqi authorities by Swiss firm Logarcheo which
acted for the Saddam clan in its purchase, a statement from the
prime minister's office said.


Finance Minister Bayan Jabr Solagh said the 12 million euro (16
million dollar) mansion with its two swimming pools, stunning
views and several hundred square metres (several thousand square
feet) of grounds was now the property of the Iraqi government.


Logarcheo bought the villa in the 1980s on behalf of Saddam's
half-brother and intelligence chief Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti,
who followed the ousted president to the gallows in January after
being convicted of crimes against humanity along with his
longtime boss.


Barzan is widely reported to have used the mansion, as did Uday
who stayed there when he was sent abroad by his father after
killing a servant while drunk.


The villa was among the assets of the old regime frozen by the
United Nations. However the title deeds had remained with
Logarcheo after the US-led invasion of 2003 left the property
uninhabited.
