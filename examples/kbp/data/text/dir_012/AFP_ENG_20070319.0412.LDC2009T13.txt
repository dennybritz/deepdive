Israel's influential security cabinet is expected this week to
examine the lessons learned from last year's war in Lebanon,
which was widely perceived as a failure in the Jewish state.


The cabinet will be briefed on Wednesday by political and
military officials on the armed forces' current preparedness for
conflict, public radio reported.


The meeting is scheduled for the same day that security services
wrap up their largest nationwide drill to simulate their response
to nuclear, chemical and biological attacks on Israeli cities.


"It is vital that members of the cabinet hear at first hand what
has been done (since the war) and the lessons that have been
learnt," deputy defence minister Ephraim Sneh told the radio
station.


"It is very important to take stock of some of the lessons of the
war this year, because no one can predict what will happen
tomorrow," warned Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai.


Shiite militia Hezbollah fired more than 4,000 rocket attacks
into northern Israel during the 34-day conflict that killed
around 40 civilians, and which Israeli leaders were pilloried for
failing to prevent.


Overall more than 160 Israelis and 1,200 Lebanese were killed in
the war, launched after Hezbollah infiltrated Israel and seized
two soldiers last July 12.


Israel has commissioned multiple investigations into the conflict
in a bid to assuage public criticism and protests from thousands
of army reservists.
