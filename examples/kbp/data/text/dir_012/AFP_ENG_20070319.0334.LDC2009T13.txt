Dozens of women and children related to fighters of a Shiite cult
group were freed on Monday, almost two months after a bloody
battle near the Iraqi holy city of Najaf, a local official said.


On January 28, a fierce battle between Shiite fighters and
security forces north of Najaf killed 263 militant followers of a
cult leader claiming to be a descendant of Prophet Mohammed.


More than 500 people were arrested after the battle, many of them
women and children family members of the slain Shiite fighters
from the group called "Soldiers of Heaven".


On Monday authorities released dozens of the women and children.


"Many of the detainess, mainly women and children, arrested after
the fight were released by the judiciary committee which is
looking into this case," said Ahmed al-Fatlawi, a member of Najaf
provincial council.


The battle in central Iraq that pitted the militants against
Iraqi and US forces was one of the deadliest in recent months.


The leader of the militia was among those killed, while a US
helicopter providing air support to security forces crashed
during the battle, killing its two crew members.
