Indian shares bounced back and closed 1.73 percent higher Monday
on bargain hunting by investors and improved Asian market trends,
dealers said.


They said near-term outlook for the market remains unclear, ahead
of a US Federal Reserve two-day meeting starting Tuesday to

The 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex index rose 214.59
points to 12,644.99, after slipping 3.52 percent or 454.59 points

"The markets saw buying interest, but it is a technical rebound.
We expect weakness ahead as there is no clarity on global market
trends," said Hiten Mehta, a fund manager with Fortune Financial
Services.
