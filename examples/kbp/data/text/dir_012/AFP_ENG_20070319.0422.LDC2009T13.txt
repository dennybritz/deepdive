Twelve candidates are to run in next month's French presidential
election after gathering the 500 endorsements needed to qualify,
France's Constitutional Court announced Monday.


The 12 include right-wing favourite Nicolas Sarkozy, Socialist
Segolene Royal and centrist Francois Bayrou, as well as anti-
globalisation crusader Jose Bove, who was uncertain of qualifying
for the April 22 first round.
