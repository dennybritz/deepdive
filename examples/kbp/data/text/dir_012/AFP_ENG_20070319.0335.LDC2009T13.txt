Wallid bin Attash, a captured Al-Qaeda operative, has confessed
that he was the mastermind of the October 2000 bombing of the USS
Cole in Yemen, according to a transcript of a military hearing
released Monday.


Attash said he bought the explosives and recruited members of the
team that rammed an explosives-laden boat into the side of the
American destroyer while it was refueling in the port of Aden.


"I put together the plan for the operation a year and a half
prior to the operation," Attash told a military panel convened in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to determine his status as an enemy
combatant.
