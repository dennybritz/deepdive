Croatia's two stock exchanges competed their merger on Monday to
create a unified, central market in the Balkan country.


The merger of the Zagreb Stock Exchange and the stock exchange of
Varazdin, a town in northern Croatia, was agreed under a deal
announced last December.


The capitalisation of companies traded on the new bourse totals
40 billion euros (53.2 billion dollars), ZSE spokesman Zeljko
Kardum told AFP.


The deal reinforced Croatia's position in the region of the
former Yugoslavia as the country with the second-biggest stock
exchange after neighbouring Slovenia, said Kardum.


"Zagreb Stock Exchange already controlled 40 percent of stock
market capitalisation in the region and this contribution will
make it even bigger," he said.


The deal gives the new bourse a total of 426 listed securities,
said the ZSE.


Prior to the merger, companies traded on the Zagreb Stock
Exchange had a market capitalisation of 28.6 billion euros. The
value of the new bourse amounts to 34 billion euros in shares and
six billion euros in bonds.
