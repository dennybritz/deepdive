Boys in one-parent families face nearly twice the risk of being
sexually abused compared with those in two-parent households,
according to a study published on Tuesday.


The study, by William Holmes of the University of Pennsylvania's
School of Medicine, was based on interviews with 186 American
men.


Of 76 men from one-parent families, 22, or 29 percent, had been
sexually abused as a child, compared with 18, or 16 percent, of
the 110 men from two-parent households.


Holmes, writing in the British review Journal of Epidemiology and
Community Health, suggests boys in US one-parent households face
higher risk of parental absence and of living in an environment
where there is a higher risk of alcohol or drug use.


Abused men from two-parent families were likelier to have been
assaulted by males or a relative.


But among abused men from a one-parent home, the perpetrator was
likelier to have been from outside the family and was often
female, such as a babysitter.


Previous studies have found that children with absent parents
have higher emotional needs, which leads them to seek attention
and affection from other adults.


This in turn exposes them to the risk of assault if these adults
are exploitative.
