US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke by telephone with
her major power counterparts Monday about how to respond to the
creation of a Palestinian unity government, a senior US official
said.


The conference call with the top diplomats of the European Union,
United Nations and Russia came amid signs of a split amont the
four Middle East mediators over whether to deal with the new
Palestinian administration grouping moderates and the radical
Islamic movement Hamas.


State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the the so-called
Quartet ministers were "taking stock of the situation" following
the new government's formal creation on Saturday.
