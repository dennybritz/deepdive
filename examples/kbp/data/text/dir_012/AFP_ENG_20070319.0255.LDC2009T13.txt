Bird flu has killed a 21-year-old man in Indonesia, an official
announced Monday, taking the death toll in the nation worst hit
by the disease to 66.


"The victim died just a while ago at a hospital in Surabaya,"
said I Nyoman Kandun from the health ministry here, referring to
the country's second-largest city in East Java province.


Kandun, director general of the ministry's Eradication of
Contagious Diseases section, said the man was already on the list
of 86 confirmed human bird flu infection cases in the country
since the first sufferer was detected in mid 2005.


He could not give further details, including how the victim had
caught the disease.


Most human infection cases come from contact with sick or
infected birds.


In an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the government has
banned residents in the capital from keeping poultry in their
back yards, a popular practice in the sprawling city.


The virus has killed at least 169 people worldwide, mostly in
Southeast Asia, according to the World Health Organisation, and
the global spread of the deadly H5N1 strain is being closely
tracked.


Scientists say multiple strains of the disease originated in
southern China and spread elsewhere.


They fear the H5N1 strain could mutate into a form easily spread
among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to
kill millions.
