West Indies won the toss and chose to field in their World Cup
Group D match against Zimbabwe on Monday at Sabina Park.


West Indies are playing an unchanged 11, but Zimbabwe have made
three changes, bringing Friday Kasteni, Tawanda Mupariwa, and
Anthony Ireland into the side for Terrence Duffin, Gary Brent and
Edward Rainsford.


West Indies won the opening match against Pakistan by 54 runs
last Tuesday, and Zimbabwe tied with Ireland in their Cup opener
last Thursday.


Ireland top Group D with three points - one more than West Indies
and two ahead of Zimbabwe (both with a match in hand) - leaving
Pakistan at the bottom of the table with no points.


A victory would make West Indies the first side to reach the
Super Eights.


Zimbabwe contest their final match on Wednesday against Pakistan,
and West Indies and Ireland close the group stage on Friday.


The two sides observed a minute's silence in memory of the late
Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer.


A day after Pakistan exited the World Cup, the 58-year-old
Woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room, and pronounced
dead a few hours later in the University Hospital of the West
Indies in the Jamaica capital.


World Cup organisers have announced that flags at the ground will
be flown at half mast, and teams and match officials will wear
black armbands in tribute to Woolmer.
