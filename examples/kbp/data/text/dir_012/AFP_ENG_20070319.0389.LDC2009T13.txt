US President George W. Bush said Monday that now was not the time
for US troops in Iraq to "pack up and go home" as the unpopular
war slipped into its fifth year amid deep pessimism.


"It could be tempting to look at the challenges in Iraq and
conclude our best option is to pack up and go home. That may be
satisfying in the short run, but I believe the consequences for
American security would be devastating," Bush said in an eight-
minute statement from the White House.
