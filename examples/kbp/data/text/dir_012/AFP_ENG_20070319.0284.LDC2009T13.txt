Bermuda captain Irving Romaine elected to field after winning the
toss against India in a World Cup match at the Queen's Park Oval
here on Monday.


Both the teams are winless after one game, with India going down
to Bangladesh by five wickets and debutants Bermuda losing to Sri
Lanka by 243 runs.


India made one change from the team which played against
Bangladesh, bringing in leg-spinner Anil Kumble in place of off-
spinner Harbhajan Singh.


"We will have to bat well and put in a good performance and then
put them under pressure," said India skipper Rahul Dravid.


"The pitch does a bit at the start but you would back yourself as
a good batting side."


India: Rahul Dravid (capt), Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly,
Robin Uthappa, Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag, Mahendra Dhoni,
Ajit Agarkar, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel.


Bermuda: Irving Romaine (capt), Dean Minors, Oliver Pitcher,

Jones, Kevin Hurdle, Dwayne Leverock, Stephen Outerbridge.
