Russian state debt totalled 39.5 billion dollars (52 billion
euros) on January 1, 2007, with the amount owed to the Paris Club
group of creditor nations sharply reduced, official data showed
on Monday.


The amount owed to the Paris Club, an informal group of public
lenders from the developed world, fell to 3.1 billion dollars,
while debt to non-member countries fell to 3.3 billion dollars,
data from the Russian finance ministry showed.


By far the biggest share of the debt, 84 percent totalling 31.9
billion euros, was in the form of eurobonds.


Buoyed by high oil and gas prices, Russia has paid back most of
the debt to the Paris Club built up by the Soviet Union and at a
quicker pace than expected.


The country paid back 23.7 billion dollars to the Paris Club in
2006 and 15 billion euros in 2005.


The early debt repayments demonstrated the remarkable turnaround
in Russia's financial fortunes after the government sparked a
major financial and banking crisis by defaulting on debt payments
in 1998.


Following the crisis, Russia's public debt as a percentage of GDP
rose to 96 percent in 1999.
