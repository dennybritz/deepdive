Former French football federation president (FFF) Claude Simonet
faces a six- month suspended prison sentence and a 10,000-euro
fine for defrauding the organisation, public prosecutors
recommended on Monday.


Prosecutors also recommended a three-month suspended sentence and
a 6,000-euro fine for former FFF treasurer and current vice-
president Bernard Bacourt.


"We are not in the domain of error but that of fault," said
prosecutor Romain Victor, refuting Simonet's good faith argument.
"There are sufficient elements to show manipulation of the
accounts."


Simonet and Bacourt are accused of creative accounting in the
2002/03 season to hide a 13.90-million-euro deficit. The court
case continues on Tuesday.
