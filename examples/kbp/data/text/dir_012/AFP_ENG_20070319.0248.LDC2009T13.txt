Sri Lanka's top cricket officials Monday put aside their
differences and united in paying tribute to Bob Woolmer, the
Pakistani national coach who died suddenly in Jamaica.


Jayantha Dharmadasa, president of the Sri Lanka Cricket Interim
Committee, said Woolmer's death was a big loss to the cricketing
world.


"I have already sent Sri Lanka Cricket's condolences to the
Pakistani Cricket Board and Bob's family," Dharmadasa said,
adding that Woolmer had proved his worth as a coach with both
South Africa and Pakistan.


"Humiliation suffered by Pakistan was not Bob's fault,"
Dharmadasa told AFP, referring to the loss to Ireland which ended
Pakistan's World Cup hopes.


Dharmadasa's predecessor and rival for the leadership of Sri
Lanka cricket, Thilanga Sumathipala, recalled the former England
batsman's coaching capabilities.


Sumathipala expressed gratitude for Woolmer's guidance in making
the International Cricket Coaches' Conference held here in 2003 a
success.


"Bob, world cricket is going to miss you, as for me you have been
the best and the most innovative cricket coach in the world in
recent times," Sumathipala said in a statement.


Woolmer as a player toured Sri Lanka in February 1977 as part of
Tony Greig's England team on their way to that year's Centenary
Test in Melbourne.


He was at one point considered as a successor to Dav Whatmore by
the Sri Lankan cricket authorities.
