A Dutch court ordered Monday the release of a Dutch timber trader
awaiting appeal after being convicted last year of selling arms
to Liberia's ex-strongman Charles Taylor.


Guus Kouwenhoven, then president of the Oriental Timber
Corporation, was sentenced in June to eight years in jail for
supplying AK-47 machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade anti-
tank weapons to Taylor between 2000 and 2003, in violation of an
UN arms embargo against Liberia.


According to the prosecution, Kouwenhoven smuggled guns into
Liberia in exchange for lucrative timber concessions for his
logging companies. These weapons were subsequently used by
Taylor's troops to commit atrocities against rebels and
civilians.


The Dutch businessman in his sixties has maintained his innocence
and has appealed his conviction.


At the same time, the Dutch prosecutor has also filed an appeal
of the lower court's decision that Kouwenhoven was not guilty of
war crimes as he could not be linked directly to the atrocities
in the west African region.


The date of the appeals trial has not yet been set. Meanwhile
Kouwenhoven must check in with police every two weeks and is
barred from leaving the Netherlands.


Taylor is currently being held in The Hague, where his trial on
11 counts of crimes against humanity, war crimes and human rights
violations will be heard by the Special Court for Sierra Leone
(SCSL) from June 4.
