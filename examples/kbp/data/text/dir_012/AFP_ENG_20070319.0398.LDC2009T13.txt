Russia's UN envoy stormed out of a Security Council meeting on
Kosovo here Monday and accused the UN special envoy for the
Albanian-majority Serbian province of "preaching for
independence."


"His remarks have been extremely one-sided and unhelpful,"
Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters, referring to the UN
special envoy for Kosovo Joachim Rucker. "He was preaching for
independence instead of discussing implementation of Resolution
1244 and this is very unhelpful."


Security Council 1244, adopted in 1999, authorizes the United
Nations to facilitate a political process to determine Kosovo's
future status.
