Iran on Monday lifted a ban on a popular conservative news
website that published articles critical of President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad.


"Following an order of the State Council the ban on 'Baztab' was
lifted and this site was reopened," said a message on the
restored website that had been shut down in February by the
culture ministry.


The ministry of culture and Islamic guidance had declared Baztab
illegal for "acting against the constitution, disrupting national
unity and spreading lies."


Baztab, linked to former Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen
Rezai, had published articles criticising the economic policies
of Ahmadinejad's government and its decision to hold a conference
questioning the veracity of the Holocaust.


But it also has a record of being equally critical of Iran's
reformists.


This month, Iran's hardline judiciary allowed a number of banned
moderate dailies to republish, including the flagship centrist
daily Shargh after a half- year ban.
