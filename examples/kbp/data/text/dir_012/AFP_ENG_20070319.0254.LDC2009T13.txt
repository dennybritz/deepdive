US President George W. Bush will make a brief statement at 11:30
am (1530 GMT) on the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq,
a White House spokeswoman said Monday.


Earlier in the day, Bush held a National Security Council meeting
on the war. He was to discuss the latest developments by secure
videoconference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki at 9:40
a.m. (1440 GMT), said spokeswoman Dana Perino.


"Then, at 11:30, the president will make a statement on the
fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq in the Roosevelt Room.
It will last about five minutes and he will take no questions,"
she told AFP by telephone.
