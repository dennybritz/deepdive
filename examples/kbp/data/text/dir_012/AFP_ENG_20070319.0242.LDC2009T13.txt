AIDS patients in Zambia are abandoning their life-prolonging
drugs in exchange for bogus cures that have hit the market in
recent weeks, a leading AIDS advocacy group said Monday.


The Network of Zambian People Living with HIV/AIDS (NZP+) said it
has received reports that some of its members were stopping the
use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for fake cures being promoted
in the media.


"We want to express serious concerns about this situation," said
Mirian Banda, chairperson of NZP+.


"As people living with HIV/AIDS, we request government to provide
the public with proper information and guidance around the
supposed cures," Banda said.


One of Zambia's weekly newspapers published a story indicating
that a drug that cures AIDS had been discovered in the United
States, and saying the newspaper's editor was the authorised
dealer of the 'cure' in Zambia.


Another traditional herbalist appeared on a live radio programme
claiming that she had found the cure for AIDS and all her
patients abandoned their ARVs after taking her medicines.


"Zambia has already seen numerous examples of claims to cure HIV,
all of which have proven to be untrue, confusing, and regrettably
lethal, since they draw HIV positive people away from proper ways
of dealing with their status," Banda said.


She said Zambia had 75,000 HIV positive people taking ARVs while
1.2 million others are carriers of the HI virus.


Last month, government announced that three herbs initially
thought to cure AIDS had proved ineffective after undergoing a
thorough six-month clinical trial.
