A Saudi national was beheaded by the sword on Monday in northern
Saudi Arabia after being convicted of murdering a member of the
same tribe, the interior ministry said.


Salem bin Jomaian al-Shimmary was found guilty of stabbing dead
Fares bin Mofdi al-Shimmary after a fistfight, the ministry said
in a statement carried by the official SPA news agency.


He was executed in the northern town of Hail, 720 kilometres (446
miles) north of the capital Riyadh.


His beheading brings to 21 the number of executions announced by
the Saudi authorities so far this year.


Last year at least 37 people were executed, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in ultra-
conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of sharia
or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.


The New York-based Human Rights Watch last month asked Saudi
Arabia to stay executions after it beheaded four Sri Lankans for
armed robbery on February 19 and ordered the public display of
their bodies.
