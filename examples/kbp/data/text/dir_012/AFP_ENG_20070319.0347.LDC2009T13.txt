Twelve people were killed and some 14,000 made homeless after a
cyclone struck northern Madagascar last week, according to
revised figures released Monday.


A toll on Sunday said cyclone Indlala, the deadliest so far this
season, had killed two people in Antalaha, some 570 kilometres
(354 miles) northeast of the capital of the Indian Ocean island.


But national emergencies chief Jacky Randriaharison said Monday
that at least 10 people had also died on Saturday and Sunday in
Ambanja, 625 kilometres north of the capital. He also revised
upwards the toll of those made homeless.


"Following the passage of Indlala, we have counted 13,999
affected people who have had to leave their houses that were
flooded or completely destroyed," he said, adding that they were
now housed in schools, churches and community buildings.


The cyclone left a trail of devastation in its wake after
striking Thursday, damaging buildings and infrastructure.


Indlala is the sixth cyclone to hit the island since the
beginning of December. Cyclone season in the region runs between
December and March.


Two people were killed on December 26 when Cyclone Bondo reached
the southwestern Menabe region.
