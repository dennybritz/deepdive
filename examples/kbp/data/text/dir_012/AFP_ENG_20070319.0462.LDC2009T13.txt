A US delegation is going to Chechnya to learn from Russia's
experience there in the "war on terror" and apply it to the
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, a Russian general said on
Monday.


"Our activities in the fight against terrorism have attracted
attention" in the United States, said General Arcady Edelev, a
deputy interior minister, cited by the Interfax news agency.


The delegation from the US State Department has asked the Russian
foreign ministry for permission to visit Chechnya "to learn about
our unique experience in order to apply it to Iraq and
Afghanistan," Edelev was quoted as saying.


Besides the American officials, the delegation will also include
representatives from other Group of Eight major industrialised
nations.


Russia's military role in Chechnya however has drawn protests
from Russian and international human rights groups who have
accused Moscow and their Chechen supporters of torture,
kidnappings and other violent abuses of power in the crackdown on
the Chechen separatist rebels.


After Chechnya's first separatist war from 1994 to 1996, Russian
federal troops launched a second military operation in 1999.


The bombardment of Grozny led to the fall of the Chechen capital
in March 2000 and since then the conflict has evolved into a
guerrilla warfare between the separatist fighters and Russian
soldiers and pro-Moscow Chechen militias.
