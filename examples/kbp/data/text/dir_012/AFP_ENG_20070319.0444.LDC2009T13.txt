Thirty Czech military medical staff left for Afghanistan on
Monday to set up a field hospital in Kabul that will treat NATO
troops and train local doctors, army officials said.


The hospital will have the capacity to perform 40 to 50
operations per day as well as provide 24-hour care to 300
wounded, the defence ministry said.


The mission will eventually be staffed by 100 Czech servicemen
for a period of up to 12 months, fulfilling a commitment made at
a NATO summit in Riga last November.


Two Czech field hospitals have already been deployed in
Afghanistan (2002) and Iraq (2003).


One hundred and fifty other Czech troops are currently serving in
Kabul and the northern town of Feyzabad.


The aim of the hospital is to provide medical assistance to NATO
soldiers and train local doctors, said the hospital's commander
on Czech television.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in
Afghanistan comprises almost 35,500 troops drawn from 37 nations,
including Britain and the United States. One of its priorities is
to combat the Taliban insurgency.
