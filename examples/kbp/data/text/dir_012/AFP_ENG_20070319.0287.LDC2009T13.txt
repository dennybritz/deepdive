Cameroon defender Pierre Wome announced his international
retirement Monday in an interview with government newspaper the
Cameroon Tribune.


The Wereder Bremen player has not played for the Indomitable
Lions since missing a penalty against Egypt in October 2005 that
cost his country a place at the World Cup in Germany last year.


"I'm not playing for the national team any more. That's two years
people have been knocking me and I've had enough," said Wome.


"I'm leaving because I feel that Cameroonian football is walking
on its head. The coaches aren't taking responsibility any more
and it's the players who pick the team.


"That's too much so I'm just going to concentrate on my club
career now."


Wome played 67 times for Cameroon, scoring five goals and was
part of the African Nations Cup winning sides of 2000 and 2002
and the Sydney Olympic champions of 2000.
