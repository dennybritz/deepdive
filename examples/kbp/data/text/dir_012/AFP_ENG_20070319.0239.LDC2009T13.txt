A Palestinian militant was killed in Gaza on Monday when a bomb
he was preparing went off prematurely, setting off a blast that
wounded nine other people, including two children, officials
said.


Alaa al-Hissi, a 25-year-old militant with the radical Islamic
Jihad, died of the wounds sustained in the explosion at two-
storey house in the Shatti refugee camp in Gaza, the group and
medics said.


The powerful blast also damaged five nearby houses, they said.


Numerous Palestinian militants have been killed in Gaza over the
past several years when bombs they were preparing exploded
prematurely.


Islamic Jihad has been responsible for most of the rocket attacks
and suicide bombings in Israel over the past few years.
