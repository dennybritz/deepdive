The United States has approved a visa for Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to address the UN Security Council when it
votes on a new sanctions resolution against his country, a senior
US official said Monday.


"It's been approved," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack
said of the visa request submitted by the Iranian leader last
week and ahead of the Security Council action expected in the
coming days.
