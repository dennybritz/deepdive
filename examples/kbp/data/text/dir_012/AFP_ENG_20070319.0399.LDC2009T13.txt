More than a quarter of people in two southern Afghan provinces at
the heart of the Taliban insurgency back the ousted regime and
almost half think it will triumph in the end, a survey said
Monday.


The Senlis Council think-tank, which questioned 17,000 Afghans
earlier this month in Kandahar and Helmand, said 26.8 percent of
those asked supported the former ruling regime.


And 49 percent believe the Taliban, which is strongest in the two
provinces, will defeat the current Afghan government and the
35,000 NATO forces currently stationed in the country, the survey
said.


"The results from the survey are extremely alarming because they
indicate that the international community is in serious trouble
in Afghanistan," said Norine MacDonald, the council's president.


"A return of the Taliban into power would have grave consequences
for both the people of Afghanistan and for global security."


The Senlis Council, which has offices in London, Kabul, Paris,
Brussels and Ottawa, is calling for a halt to the forced
eradication of poppy crops, which it says deprives farmers of a
major income stream.
