Egyptian police have arrested a Palestinian man near the northern
Sinai town of El-Arish who was planning an anti-Israeli suicide
attack, a security official said on Monday.


Salah Adnan was a student at the El-Arish branch of Cairo's Al-
Azhar University and had been living in Egypt for nine months
when police arrested him at the end of last week, the official
said on condition of anonymity.


The suspect belonged to the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas
and was headed to the Red Sea resort of Taba, the official added.
He planned to attack either an Israeli tourist group or cross
into Israel to blow himself up.
