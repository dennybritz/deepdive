French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie called on China
Monday to raise transparency over its military budget, a move
that would help alleviate suspicion over the nation's growing
military might.


"It is true that some people are worried with the increase in
(China's) defense budget," Alliot-Marie told journalists in
Beijing, the latest stop in an Asia tour that has taken her to
Tokyo and Seoul.


"The Chinese authorities have told me what the increases were for
and I told them that transparency would be able to lift the
suspicions."


Alliot-Marie, who met with President Hu Jintao and other military
leaders on Monday, said she had noted a lack of confidence
between the neighbouring countries that she had visited and
attributed such unease to recent history.


"Transparency is the number one condition for the lifting of
suspicions," she said.


Alliot-Marie said China has earmarked a 17.8 percent increase in
military spending in 2007, "making the defence budget of China
1.6 percent of GDP, much less than other nations in the region, I
should say, and also that of France which is currently about two
percent."


She said she was told by Chinese officials that much of the
increase in spending would be given to soldiers who had not had
salary increases in recent years.
