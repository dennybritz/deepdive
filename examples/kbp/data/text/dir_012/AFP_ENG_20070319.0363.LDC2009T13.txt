Turkey on Monday dismissed speculation that it had turned over to
Israel a retired Iranian general who went missing in Istanbul
last month.


"Turkey is in close cooperation with Iran on the fate of Ali Reza
Asghari. Speculative reports or comments do not contribute to
progress on the issue," a diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told AFP.


He was responding to allegations by Asghari's wife, Sima Ahmadi,
who said  that Turkish intelligence forces had handed her husband
over to Israel as she demonstrated outside the Turkish embassy in
Tehran with several family members on Monday.


Asghari, a former deputy defence minister, went missing in
Turkey's biggest city Istanbul last month shortly after checking
into a luxury hotel on a private visit, according to press
reports.


The Washington Post reported last week that Asghari had left his
country and was cooperating voluntarily with Western intelligence
agencies while the Sunday Times of London alleged he had been
spying on Iran since 2003.


Iran has charged that Asghari may have been kidnapped by Western
spy agencies and has sent diplomats to Turkey to investigate.
