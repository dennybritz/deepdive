African leaders must take the lead in resolving the crisis in
Zimbabwe, British Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said
Monday.


Mugabe's government has accused Britain, the former colonial
power, and other Western governments of meddling in its domestic
affairs by criticizing its heavy crackdown on the oppopsition.


"The important thing in terms of influencing events on the ground
is that this is seen as the Africans in the lead rather than us,"
Blair's official spokesman told a press briefing.


Blair's spokesman said the "next steps" to resolve the crisis
will be taken at an umpcoming summit of southern African leaders.


Opposition to the 83-year-old Mugabe, in power since independence
in 1980, has been steadily mounting amid an economic meltdown
with inflation standing at 1,730 percent and four out five people
out of work.


Mugabe however has remained defiant in the face of virulent
international criticism, blaming the unrest on the opposition
Movement for Democratic Change and its critics.


Chief MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai is currently recovering from
an assault at the hands of the security services last week who
arrested him and dozens of supporters as they tried to stage an
anti-government rally on March 11.


"For our part ... we will do everything we can to maintain the
pressure," said Blair's spokesman, citing European Union
sanctions, travel bans and asset freezes for more than 100
members of the Zimbabwean leadership.
