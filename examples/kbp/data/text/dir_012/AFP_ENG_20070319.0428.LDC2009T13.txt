David Beckham has launched a new website to provide coaching
advice to teachers and pupils.


The website is an extension of Beckham's football academy which
hosts free educational days. So far more than 12,000 children in
the UK have benefitted from those open days but now Beckham is
hoping anyone, anywhere can take advantage of what his academy
has to offer.


Beckham, visiting Bristol's City Academy School, said: "I have
seen first-hand how boys and girls respond to the coaches at the
academy.


"I am extremely proud of the work we have achieved to date with
schools and community groups who visit the academy for free and I
am pleased that now every school will get the chance to sample
what we provide."


The website is called 'School Zone' and can be accessed from the
former England captain's www.thedavidbeckhamacademy.co.uk
website.
