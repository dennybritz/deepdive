At least 61 people were killed on Monday when a gas explosion
ripped through a Russian coal mine, a spokesman for the regional
governor told AFP.


"Sixty-one miners are dead and 88 have been rescued and brought
to the surface," the spokesman said by telephone. He said 183
people were in the mine at the time of the blast.
