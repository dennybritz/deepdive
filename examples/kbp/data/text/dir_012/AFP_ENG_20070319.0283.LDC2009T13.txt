Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard rejected rumours he is set to the
leave the club at the end of the season, in an interview
published by Spanish newspaper El Periodico on Monday.


The 44-year-old has a contract until 2009 but in February As
newspaper claimed it had word from well-informed sources that the
Dutchman would leave at the season's end.


"I'm not thinking about coaching another team. I have enough work
here and I am committed to Barcelona, even if everything depends
on results, that's normal it won't be a surprise," said Rijkaard.


"I believe I owe a debt to Barcelona due to all the support they
have given me and I have to keep going.


"When people put their faith in you and help you, you cannot turn
your back on them."


The Spanish press have reported many times that AC Milan are keen
on taking Rijkaard to Italy to return to the San Siro stadium he
graced as a player.


Rijkaard's Barcelona have picked up the last two Spanish league
titles and also won the Champions League last year, although they
fell at the last 16 stage this time around in a surprise defeat
to Liverpool.


They are top of the Spanish league, goal difference ahead of
Sevilla, and still in the Spanish Cup.


The Dutchman has previously coached the Netherlands and Sparta
Rotterdam.
