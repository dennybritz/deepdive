Morocco and Belgium agreed at a conference in Marrakesh on Monday
to tighten their collaboration in the fight against terrorism.


"The two nations have committed to work together and to mobilise
all the means possible to guard themselves against terrorism,"
Moroccan Interior Minister Chakib Benmoussa and his Belgian
counterpart Patrick Dewael said in a statement.


Terrorism, they added, was "an increasingly urgent threat to the
peace and stability of Morocco and Belgium and the region in
general."


Several Moroccans belonging to the Al-Qaeda-linked Moroccan
Islamic Combat Group (GICM) were recently handed long prison
sentences in Brussels, while two Belgians of Moroccan origin have
been linked to a terrorism case in Morocco.


The two interior ministers signed an accord on structural
cooperation along with an action plan involving the police forces
of both countries.


Three other accords on cooperation between the countries was also
signed at the conference, presided over by Moroccan Prime
Minister Driss Jettou and his Belgian counterpart Guy
Verhofstadt.


Verhofstadt, who in addition to Dewael was accompanied by his
ministers for justice and for cooperation and development, was
set to meet King Mohammed VI Monday afternoon before returning to
Belgium.
