Serve fruits and vegetables at meetings rather chocolate and
pastries, the office of the Norwegian prime minister has told
ministries.


"The prime minister's chief-of-staff has told the front offices
of the ministries to have fruit and vegetables rather than
cookies and cakes available (at gatherings)," Trude Maaseide,
spokeswoman for the Norwegian prime minister's office, told AFP
on Monday.


"During a stressful day it is easy to grab the first thing
available. (Staff) should make sure that a healthy alternative is
on option," she explained, adding that the request was a
"reminder" rather than an "obligation".


The request was made a few days ago.


Some ministers had mixed feelings about the instruction.


"It's not very good for people like me who like chocolate,"
Agriculture Minister Terje Riis Johansen told the Norwegian daily
Dagbladet.


But, he added, "the lives we lead are very unstructured when it
comes to food, so it would be nice to have a bit more healthy
food."


Riis Johansen cited as an example his birthday, celebrated last
Thursday.


"I started the day with ice cream and cake at 8:00 am. It's not
very good," he said.
