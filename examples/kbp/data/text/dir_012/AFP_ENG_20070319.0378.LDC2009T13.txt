An insurance magnate challenging a British court ruling that
ordered him to pay his former wife 48 million pounds (70.5
million euros, 92.4 million dollars) saw the freeze on his assets
extended Monday pending the outcome of his appeal.


London's High Court last year had ordered John Charman, 54, to
pay that amount to his ex-wife Beverley Charman, 53, reducing his
wealth to 87 million pounds.


The total sum includes eight million pounds of assets already in
his wife's name, with the remainder to be paid to her in a lump
sum.


A judicial source said Monday's hearing at the Court of Appeal
"was simply to gain an injunction from Beverley Charman to
continue freezing John Charman's assets pending the decision in
the case.


"There was not a decision on the court of appeal case. The
injunction has been granted on the freezing order until the
decision," the source added.


John Charman, who owns the Axis insurance group called last
year's ruling, a record in British legal history, "grotesque and
unfair," and insisted his offer of 20 million pounds was fair.


The couple married in 1976, when neither had significant wealth,
and separated in November 2003 before divorcing in April 2005.
