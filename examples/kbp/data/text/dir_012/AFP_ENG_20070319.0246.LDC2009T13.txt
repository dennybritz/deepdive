British supermodel Naomi Campbell began a week of mopping floors
at a New York city warehouse Monday as part of a court-ordered
community service sentence for throwing a cell phone at her
housekeeper.


Wearing black patent stiletto boots, brown pants and a knee-
length black jacket, Campell arrived at the run-down Lower East
Side Sanitation Department warehouse with a pair of paratrooper
boots slung over her shoulder.


She did not speak to a gaggle of waiting reporters and TV crews
as she got out of a black sports utility vehicle and strode
towards the riverside facility in freezing temperatures.


The supermodel who was sentenced in January after pleading guilty
to reckless assault, on Monday began day one scrubbing a Lower
East Side Sanitation Department warehouse.


Campbell, 36, was also ordered to attend a two-day anger
management course and pay more than 350 dollars to cover
housekeeper Ana Scolavino's medical expenses over the March 2006
incident.


She has said that she would auction off the jeans and boots she
wears during the court-ordered mopping duties for charity.


"It'll go straight to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund," she
said in a recent newspaper interview.
