A species of beetle thought to have become extinct in Britain
nearly 60 years ago has been rediscovered, the National Trust
said Monday.


The short-necked oil beetle was last recorded at Chailey Common
in Sussex, southeast England, in 1948 but bug-lover Bob Heckford
rediscovered 40 of them in the southwestern county of Devon.


It was thought that the insects, which are flightless, slow-
moving and have short wings, had been wiped out by intensive
farming practices.


The beetles get their name from the highly toxic, oily secretions
which they produce when threatened.


David Bullock, head of nature conservation at the National Trust
-- the heritage charity which owns the land where the beetles
were found -- said it was "an amazing story of survival".


"It's likely that this population of the short-necked oil beetle
has survived because they inhabit an area of land that has
avoided the intensive farming methods on surrounding arable
land," he added.
