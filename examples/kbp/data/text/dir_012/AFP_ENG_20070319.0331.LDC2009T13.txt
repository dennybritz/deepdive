Every euro spent on weather forecasting technology can bring
sevenfold savings in dealing with the consequences of climate
change, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said Monday.


"It has been shown that each euro spent on predicting the
vagaries of the weather allows seven to be saved for remedying
economic losses" emanating from natural disasters, WMO secretary
general Michel Jarraud said.


Jarraud was opening a four-day conference, hosted by the Spanish
government, on how to make improved use of meteorological data
and the social and economic benefits to society of products and
services provided by meteorologists and hydrologists.


"Decision-making linked to meteorology daily affect the lives of
hundreds of millions of people wordwide," said Jarraud after
Spain's Queen Sofia had opened the conference.


The focus of the opening day of the meeting was on the dangers of
climate change and how to warn of natural disasters linked to the
phenomenon.


The most recent UN-sponsored report on climate change, published
last month, warned global temperatures would rise by between 1.8
and four degrees Celsius by 2100, bringing increased prevalence
of drought, heatwaves and heavy rainfall.


"The threat is real," WMO chairman Alexander Bedritsky warned.


"All the money which can be invested in prevention will have
positive consequences," he stressed.
