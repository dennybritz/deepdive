Hamas on Monday slammed Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's
appointment of Mohammad Dahlan, a strongman from the rival Fatah
faction, as his national security advisor.


"Hamas considers that the naming by president Abbas of deputy
Mohammad Dahlan as his national security advisor is contrary to
Palestinian law," the Islamist movement said in a statement.


"We call on president Abbas to submit his decision to a judicial
review to determine whether or not it conforms with the law," it
said.


Abbas appointed 45-year-old Dahlan to the post on Sunday, one day
after the Palestinians inaugurated their long-awaited government
of national unity that unites the Islamist Hamas with secular
Fatah and independents.


Dahlan is widely reviled by Hamas, which has accused him of being
a "putschist" who tried to topple the previous Hamas cabinet and
of trying to organise an assassination of premier Ismail Haniya
in December.


Dahlan, a former minister of internal security and former chief
of Gaza's powerful preventive security force, has long been one
of Hamas's harshest critics.


A leading Fatah figure, he led a merciless crackdown on Hamas in
the 1990s, rounding up thousands of the Islamists who refused to
recognise the legitimacy of the newly created Palestinian
Authority.
