The Belgian government said Monday it would help Belgian sub-
contractors supplying struggling aircraft maker Airbus with a
promise of 150 million euros (199 million dollars) in aid.


The public aid targeted Belgian companies participating in the
development of Airbus' future long-haul A350 XWB, Economy
Minister Marc Verwilghen said in a statement.


Since the beginning of the 1980s, Belgium has been the home of
several big Airbus sub-contractors such as Sonaca, Sabca, Asco
and Eurair, which employ thousands of workers.


"Despite the current restructuring underway at Airbus, Belgian
companies that have tradionally done sub-contract work have a
good chance of playing a key role in the development of the
Airbus XWB," the statement said.


In 2000, the government promised 195 million euros to help
develop Airbus' A380 super jumbo although only 160 million euros
have so far been used. The A380 has been plagued with production
problems and its delivery schedule has been delayed.


The Airbus A350 XWB, a 250 to 380 seat long-haul airplane, is
supposed to rival Boeing's 787 when the European passenger plane
enters service in 2008.
