The head of Britain's Virgin conglomerate said Monday he was
considering opening a casino in the southern Chinese boomtown
Macau even thouth a proposed partnership with Australian Tabcorp
to do so flopped.


Virgin boss Richard Branson was tipped to join with Tabcorp on
the 3.0 billion US dollar casino project after he visited the
outpost with the Australian gambling outfit's Matthew Slater in
January.


"Macau is a flourishing place in China and ... it is possible
that one day we might open something in Macau," Branson told a
news conference in response to a question on whether he was
planning to open a casino there.


Branson said Tabcorp had approached his firm for a possible
partnership, but the talks yielded nothing.


"We are talking to more people" about a possible partnership, he
added.


The casino is believed slated for the emerging Cotai Strip, a
glitzy new gaming district being built on a 100,000 square metre
reclamation that is expected to see the former Portuguese enclave
leapfrog Las Vegas as the world's biggest gambling draw.


Already Macau's handful of casinos pull in more cash than their
counterparts on Las Vegas' famous strip -- almost seven billion
dollars last year.


Virgin reportedly wants to cash in on a loophole that allows
foreign operators to run casinos without a licence in Macau.
