Romanian President Traian Basescu has called on the country's
prosecutor to investigate a minister over alleged irregularities
during the privatisation of the state telephone company, his
office said Monday.


Zsolt Nagy, the telecommunications minister, is suspected of
passing on confidential documents to investment bank Credit
Suisse First Boston (CSFB), which was a consultant for the
flotation of 46 percent of Romtelecom stock.


The decision to ask the prosecutor general to start proceedings
was taken because only judicial action would clarify the
situation, the statement from Basescu's office said.


According to Romanian law a minister in office cannot face legal
action without the agreement of the head of state.


The Romtelecon case is part of the prosecutor's larger inquiry
into privatisations in Romania since 2005.


The inquiry is also looking at former economy minister Codrut
Seres, two government advisors and two CSFB consultants who have
been accused of favoring the Italian energy group Enel in last
year's sale of a Romanian electritcity company, Electrica
Muntenia Sud.


Enel in June won a tender to buy 67.5 percent of the shares in
EMS, which provides electricity to Bucharest and two other
regions.


CFSB has said it has no reason to suspect that its employees
acted in an inappropriate manner in the sale.
