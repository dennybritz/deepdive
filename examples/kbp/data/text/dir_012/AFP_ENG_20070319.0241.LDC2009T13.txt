Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his Armenian
counterpart on Monday inaugurated a natural gas pipeline reducing
energy-strapped Armenia's reliance on Russian gas.


Ahmadinejad and Armenian President Robert Kocharian formally
opened the pipeline in the Armenian town of Agarak, near the
border with Iran.


"This is a historic event that opens a new period in the
relations of Iran and Armenia," Kocharian said at the ceremony.


Under a 20-year contract, Armenia is projected to receive 36
billion cubic metres of gas through the 141-kilometre (89-mile)
pipeline, breaking Russian gas giant Gazprom's stranglehold on
the ex-Soviet country's gas market.


An agreement to build the 200-million-dollar (150-million-euro)
pipeline was signed in 1992 but construction only began in 2004.
Armenia will pay for the gas with electricity it produces at a
Soviet-era nuclear power plant.


Landlocked Armenia has sought closer links with Iran because of
an economic blockade imposed by neighbours Azerbaijan and Turkey
over the disputed Nagorno- Karabakh region.


Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a six-year war ending with an
uneasy ceasefire in 1994 over the majority ethnic-Armenian
enclave in Azerbaijan.
