A French consortium led by state financial body Caisse des Depots
is in exclusive talks to buy French water group Saur for a
minimum 1.72 billion euros (2.29 billion dollars), the current
owner of Saur, investment fund PAI Partners, said Monday.


Saur is France's third-biggest water and sanitation group which
was bought by PAI Partners for 1.037 billion euros in November
2004.


Last week, the Association of French Mayors had issued a
statement warning of "the worries of a number of mayors" that
Saur would be bought by "an Australian pension fund."


French newspaper Le Figaro had reported that Australian bank
Macquarie was interested in buying the group, which is the third
biggest of its kind in France after Suez and Veolia
Environnememt.


PAI said it had entered exclusive talks with the consortium for
the sale of its interest in Saur "on the basis of an equity value
of 1.72 billion euros for 100 percent of the shares."


The consortium is 47-percent owned by CDC, while French waste
treatment group Seche Environnement owns 33 percent and an
investment fund run by French insurance group AXA controls
another 20 percent.
