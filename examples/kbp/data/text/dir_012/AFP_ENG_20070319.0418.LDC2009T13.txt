The giant Airbus A380 superjumbo landed on US soil for the first
time Monday, with crowds turning out to witness the arrivals of
the world's biggest passenger plane in New York and Los Angeles.


The 555-seat double-decker behemoth, which has a wingspan the
size of a football pitch, descended smoothly through grey,
overcast skies to touch down at Los Angeles International Airport
at approximately 9.28 am (1628 GMT).


A few minutes earlier, another Airbus A380 flying from Frankfurt
landed at New York's Kennedy Airport.


The A380 in Los Angeles will undergo tests of its airport
manoeuverability and terminal parking capability.


The flight is being conducted in conjunction with Qantas Airways
of Australia, which has ordered 12 A380s and may buy eight more.
