Israel is not engaged in substantial peace talks with the
Palestinians, although it will continue to discuss humanitarian
and security issues, the government spokeswoman said on Monday.


"There are no real substantial discussions being done right now
between the Palestinian president (Mahmud Abbas) and the Israeli
prime minister (Ehud Olmert) or between officials," government
spokeswoman Miri Eisin told reporters.


"Israel will continue to work with Mahmud Abbas in order to
advance issues on security and issues pertaining to improving the
quality of living of the Palestinian people," the statement said.


Even while boycotting the Palestinian government since Islamist
group Hamas took power in March last year, Israel has maintained
contacts with Abbas, whom Olmert has met several times.


Palestinian sources have also spoken of parallel talks through a
"secret channel" involving Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni
and two leading Palestinian moderates Yasser Abed Rabbo and Salam
Fayyad.


A Livni aide told AFP that "secret contacts" were under way with
the Palestinians, but denied they were being used as a separate
channel for negotiations.


"There are occasional exchanges, but they are not continuous, so
there are no negotiations," he said.


Fayyad is now once again finance minister in the new national
unity cabinet including both Hamas and Abbas's secular Fatah
faction that was sworn in on Saturday.


But Israel made plain on Sunday that it would continue to have no
dealings with the new government.


There has been no progress in peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians since negotiations broke down in January 2001.
