Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo was freed Monday in
exchange for five Taliban prisoners, an Afghan news agency
reported citing an audiotape message from a rebel commander.


Pajhwok Afghan News said it had been sent a recorded message from
Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah confirming the release and
naming the five prisoners he was exchanged for.


Two were head of the Taliban "cultural wing", Ustad Yasar and ex-
spokesman Latifullah Hakimi, both arrested in 2005.


The others were Mansoor Ahmad, a brother of Dadullah, and two
commanders named Hamdullah and Abdul Ghaffar. There were no
details on these men.


Dadullah said he had demanded the release of another Taliban
spokesman, Mohammad Hanif, captured in October last year, but
Mansoor Ahmad was handed over instead.


Dadullah said in the tape that he was still holding
Mastrogiacomo's Afghan interpreter.


AFP could not independently confirm the terms of the release.


However, presidential spokesman Karim Rahimi told AFP that
President Hamid Karzai "had ordered the security organisations to
make all possible efforts to gain his release."
