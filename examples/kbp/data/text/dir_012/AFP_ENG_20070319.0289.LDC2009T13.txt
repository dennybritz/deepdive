The major US share indexes opened higher Monday in a move traders
attributed to merger activity, as the market also girded for the
Federal Reserve's looming interest rate meeting.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a strong 73.78 points (0.61
percent) to 12,184.19 in initial deals.


The Nasdaq composite gained 15.18 points (0.64 percent) to
2,387.84 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index
climbed 7.45 points (0.54 percent) to 1,394.40.


Stocks rose as ServiceMaster, which makes garden treatment
products and home care cleaning solutions, announced it had
agreed to be taken over by the Clayton, Dublilier and Rice
investment fund for 5.5 billion dollars.


Traders said news reports suggesting British bank Barclays has
approached Dutch investment bank ABN Amro with a 155-billion-
dollar merger proposal had also boosted sentiment.


Market participants were preparing for the Fed's two-day interest
rate meeting, which opens Tuesday, with most analysts expecting
the central bank to keep the US short-term rate anchored at 5.25
percent.
