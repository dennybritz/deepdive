Talks were underway here Monday on China's admission to the
International Development Bank (IDB), 14 years after Beijing
first sought admission to the group.


IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno and China's central bank
governor Zhou Xiaochuan formally opened talks in the Guatemalan
capital, as a meeting of the IDB board of governors got underway.


Beijing first applied to join the group in 1993, but its
membership was opposed by the United States and Japan, both of
which have since ended their objections.


No date has been set for the expected conclusion of the
negotiations.


China's admission to the IBD would have to be ratified by the
bank's 47 current members.
