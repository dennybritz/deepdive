Two more US soldiers have been killed in Baghdad, the US military
reported Wednesday, taking its losses to 34 this month alone.


A roadside bomb killed one US soldier and wounded two others on
Wednesday when their patrol was attacked, the military reported.


Another soldier was killed and one more wounded when their patrol
also came under attack in a southern district of Baghdad on
Tuesday.


The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,282, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
