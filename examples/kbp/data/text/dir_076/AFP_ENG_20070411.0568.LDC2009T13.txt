Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa sacked information minister
Vernon Mwaanga on Wednesday for "mishandling" a mission to the
Democratic Republic of Congo.


"I have relieved honourable Mwaanga from his duties and
consequently withdrew his nomination as member of parliament,"
the president said in a statement.


Mwaanga, a veteran diplomat and parliamentarian chief-whip, had
been sent by Mwanawasa as a special envoy to engage in talks with
DRC leader Joseph Kabila over the decision to close his country's
border with Zambia last month.


The DRC had in March put an embargo on trading raw minerals with
neighbouring Zambia in an effort to stop alleged illegal exports
and fraud.


Mwaanga was sacked on his return for failing to account for
statements he made during the trip in support of a provincial
governor who is wanted in Zambia for corruption and theft of
public funds.


"Your handling of the assignment was irresponsible and departed
from my expectation," Mwanawasa said in a letter directed to
Mwaanga.


Mwaanga is one of the oldest politicians who has served under
three heads of state since Zambia's independence in 1964.
