Two Canadian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan Wednesday as the
bodies of six of their comrades who died only days earlier in a
roadside blast were returning home for burial, said reports.


Broadcaster CTV said two soldiers had been killed, but gave no
details.


"We are aware of an incident, but we don't have any information
yet," defense department spokeswoman Carole Brown told AFP.


If confirmed, these latest casualties would bring the Canadian
military death toll in Afghanistan to 53 since the start of their
NATO mission in 2002.


On Monday, Canada suffered its heaviest single-day troop loss in
50 years with the death of six soldiers, on the same day it
marked the anniversary of a key World War I victory in Vimy,
France.


Canada has deployed some 2,500 soldiers in southern Afghanistan
as part of the NATO operation to quell a Taliban insurgency.
