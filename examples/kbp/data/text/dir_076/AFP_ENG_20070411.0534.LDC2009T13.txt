The United States on Wednesday denounced suicide blasts by
suspected Islamists in Algeria and Morocco and said it was
helping both countries hunt down those responsible.


"We certainly condemn the attacks," White House spokeswoman Dana
Perino said after an affiliate of terrorist mastermind Osama bin
Laden's Al-Qaeda network claimed responsibility for the attack in
Algiers.


"We are working with the Moroccan and Algerian authorities. We
stand with them as they try to find out the cause or the impetus
for the attacks," said Perino, who did not directly blame Al-
Qaeda for the strikes.


"I haven't heard that it's Al-Qaeda, I guess it wouldn't surprise
me," she said as terrorism experts warned that the attacks
amounted to the first signs of a re-emergent Al-Qaeda cell in
North Africa.


Twenty three people were killed when two car bombs exploded in
the Algerian capital on Wednesday, a day after five died in
Morocco in an incident that saw three militants blow themselves
up.


More than 160 people were injured in the explosions in Algiers --
one directly outside the central government headquarters.


In Morocco's financial capital Casablanca three militants blew
themselves up on Tuesday as they were pursued by police. A fourth
died of gunshot wounds, while a policeman was killed in one of
the suicide blasts.
