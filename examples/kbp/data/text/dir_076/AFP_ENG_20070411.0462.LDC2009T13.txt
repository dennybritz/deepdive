There's nothing odd about a couple hailing a taxi in New York,
unless, of course, your destination is Arizona.


But retired couple Betty and Bob Matas did just that Tuesday,
opting to take a yellow cab 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) to
their new home, fearing their two cats would freeze to death in a
cargo hold if they took a plane.


Cabbie Douglas Guldeniz agreed to turn off the meter and charge a
flat rate of 3,000 dollars plus expenses for the journey. If the
Matases follow New York protocol on gratuities, Guldeniz could be
in for a 450-600 dollar tip.


"I feel a little sad, but I'm going to a beautiful place," Betty,
71, told the New York Daily News just before the couple set off
on the 38-hour drive.


"We're going to miss New York... but we're ready for Sedona" --
the location of their new retirement home in the southwestern
desert state of Arizona.


Guldeniz seemed happy to pick up the Matases for what he said was
probably one of the longest-ever cab rides.


"I have good passengers, nice passengers," he told the newspaper.
His previous longest fare was around 250 kilometers to
Pennsylvania. "I'm a little bit excited," he said.


As for the two cats, they will be in separate carpet-lined cages
fitted with litter boxes in the back of the taxi, said Bob, 72,
adding that they would likely rip each other to shreds if they
had to share a cage.


"They hate each other," he told the Daily News.
