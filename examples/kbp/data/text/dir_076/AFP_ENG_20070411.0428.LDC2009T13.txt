The Arab League on Wednesday announced the postponement until May
15 of a Somali reconciliation conference originally set for next
week to allow more time for preparations.


"The delay will allow a full opportunity to prepare for the
conference," Samir Hosni, the League's representative for Africa,
explained to reporters.


He added that former Somali president Ali Mahdi Mohammed, head of
the prepatory committee, would be visiting Cairo in the coming
days to discuss preparations for the conference.


Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed originally announced in
March that a reconciliation conference of "3,000 people from
Somalia and abroad" would be held on April 16, without specifying
who would actually be involved.


But Somalia's Foreign Minister Ismail Mohamed Hurre said last
week that the conference was to be delayed.


Diplomats at a meeting of the Somalia Contact Group last week
said the deposed Islamic Courts Union would not be represented,
but members could participate in other capacities such as clan
representatives.


International officials have cited the holding of a conference
and the establishment of a truce between the warring factions
tearing the country apart as a prerequisite for the further
deployment of African Union peacekeepers.
