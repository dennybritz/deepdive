A Romanian court on Wednesday rejected a request by Valentin
Ceausescu, the son of the former Romanian communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, to have his parents exhumed for DNA tests.


Ceausescu said he wanted the bodies of his father and mother,
Elena, exhumed from the cemetery in Ghencea, Bucharest, so tests
could be carried to prove that it was indeed them who had been
buried.


Valentin Ceausescu, the only one of the couple's three children
still alive, has expressed doubts that his parents are actually
buried there.


His first bid to have them exhumed was thrown out by the court in
September 2005 but he appealed.


The couple were executed by firing squad after a summary trial on
December 25, 1989.


Such was the hatred towards the couple that they were buried
secretly at night with false names on the crosses, for fear their
graves would be vandalised.


Today the graves, marked with marbles crosses, have become a
place of pilgrimage for people nostalgic for the days of
communism, particularly on the couple's wedding anniversary.


Today's application in court was directed against the defence
ministry, which argued that it had nothing to do with the matter.


A ministry representative had been present at the burial but as a
witness only, said a spokesman.


"We are not opposed to the exhumation of the Ceausescus but we
don't understand why it would be up to us to prove their
identity," he added.
