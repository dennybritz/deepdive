The White House on Wednesday denounced suicide blasts by
suspected Islamists in Algeria and Morocco.


"We certainly condemn the attacks," said spokeswoman Dana Perino,
who told reporters that Washington was working with both
governments to hunt down those responsible for the attacks. The
bombing in Algeria has already been claimed by an Al-Qaeda
affiliate.
