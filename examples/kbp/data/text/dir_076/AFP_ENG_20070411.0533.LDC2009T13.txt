Mayors from cities bombed in wartime will attend a ceremony to
mark the 70th anniversary of the aerial bombing of the northern
Spanish town Guernica during Spain's Civil War, the city's mayor
said Wednesday.


The attack on Guernica by German and Italian aircraft allied to
General Francisco Franco's forces on April 26, 1937 was the first
time a defenceless civilian population was deliberately targeted.


Cities represented would include the Japanese city of Hiroshima,
destroyed by the United States' first Atom Bomb attack in 1945;
and the Germany city of Dresden devastated by the Allies the same
year, said Mayor Miguel Angel Aranaz.


A delegation from the English city of Coventry, which suffered
heavily from Nazi air raids in November 1940, would also attend,
he said.


"Their presence will provide an international dimension to the
70th anniversary," Aranaz told journalists.


He said that the commemoration of the bombing of Guernica, which
killed some 1,600 people, might also involve planes dropping
flowers on the town.


The carnage caused by the attack on the town, which lies at the
base of an estuary in the Basque province of Viscaya, was
immortalized by Pablo Picasso's famous painting which is named
after the town.
