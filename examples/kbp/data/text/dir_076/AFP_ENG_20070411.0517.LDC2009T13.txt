A fire broke out aboard an Argentine icebreaker while it was at
sea in the south Atlantic, forcing the crew of 296 to abandon
ship on emergency rafts, the Argentine military said Wednesday.


The fire broke out at 0100 GMT Wednesday in the generator of the
Almirante Irizar "and spread in an uncontrollable way," read a
statement from the Argentine military command.


Vice Commodore Enrique Gomez Olivera, a military command
spokesman, later told reporters that the ship crew had been
rescued and there were no victims.


He did not say how the fire broke out.


The Almirante Irizar had left Ushuaia, the world's southernmost
city, and was heading north. It caught fire some 225 kilometers
(140 miles) east of the Puerto Madryn, in the southern Argentine
province of Chubut.


The vessel had spent four months in the Antarctic on a routine
patrol.


Gomez Olivera said that the fire "was practically extinguished,"
and that the icebreaker "was less affected than initially
thought," according to information collected by airplanes that
overflew the area.


Two military airplanes, a navy corvette and a coast guard vessel
all helped in the rescue, the statement read.


The first two ships to reach the site -- a Panamanian-flagged
tanker, the Scarlet-Ibis, and an Uruguayan fishing vessel, the
Magrit -- picked up most of the ship's crew, the statement added.


The Almirante Irizar was built in Finland and has been in service
since 1978.
