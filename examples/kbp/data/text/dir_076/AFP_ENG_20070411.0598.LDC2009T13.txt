No, the CEO of troubled Ford Motor Company did not save US
President George W. Bush from blowing himself up during a
hydrogen-electric hybrid automobile demonstration in late March.


But that is how Alan Mulally, whose company posted a record loss
of 12.7 billion dollars last year, recently told the story to a
group of journalists at New York's auto show, according to the
Detroit News.


During a demonstration on the White House's South Lawn, Mulally
claimed that he noticed that someone had left the electrical cord
lying near the rear of the vehicle, close to the hydrogen fuel
tank, the News reported.


"I just thought, 'Oh my goodness!' So, I started walking faster,
and the president walked faster and he got to the cord before I
did. I violated all the protocols. I touched the president. I
grabbed his arm and I moved him up to the front," Mulallay said.


"I wanted the president to make sure he plugged into the
electricity, not into the hydrogen," said the CEO. "This is all
off the record, right?"


The problem? Video images from the event show that the cord was
not near the hydrogen fuel tank, and that Bush was never in
danger of plugging it into the fuel tank.


"If it were true, it would be a better story," White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino observed wryly on Wednesday.


The Detroit News later reported that a Ford spokesman
acknowledged that Bush was never in any danger and that Mulally
was borrowing from a comedy program's version of the event in
which the president actually did self-immolate.
