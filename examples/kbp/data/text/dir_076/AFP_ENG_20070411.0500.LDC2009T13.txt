The last grandchild of the last German emperor, Prince Wilhelm-
Karl of Prussia, has died at the age of 85, a press spokeswoman
for the House of Hohenzollern said Wednesday.


Wilhelm-Karl died Monday in the northern town of Holzminden. The
cause of death was not released.


The prince, who was born in Potsdam in 1922, was the son of
Prince Oskar and grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who ruled Prussia
until the monarchy was abolished after World War I.


Married with three children, Wilhelm-Karl was also the Count of
Ruppin and leader or "Herrenmeister" of the Order of St. John, a
Protestant charitable organisation he joined in 1944.


"He led the order through a half a century of deep societal
changes," it said in a statement.
