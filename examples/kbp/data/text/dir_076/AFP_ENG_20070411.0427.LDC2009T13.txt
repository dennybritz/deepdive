US gasoline inventories fell sharply over the past week,
government data showed Wednesday, raising fears of tight supplies
going into the key summer driving season.


New York crude oil futures rose 54 cents to 62.43 dollars a
barrel shortly after the US Department of Energy weekly snapshot
of petroleum supplies.


Crude oil inventories rose by 700,000 barrels to 333.4 million in
the week to April 6, the Department of Energy said. That was well
below of market forecasts of a gain of 1.7 million barrels.


The DoE's weekly report showed that gasoline reserves, closely
watched as the summer driving season arrives, fell by 5.5 million
barrels to 199.7 million, against a forecasted drawdown of 1.4
million barrels.


"A surprisingly massive gasoline inventory draw is likely to push
up gasoline contract prices and prices at the pump," said Jason
Schencker at Wachovia Securities, who predicted further rises in
politically sensitive motor fuel prices.


The report showed distillate inventories, which include heating
oil and diesel, rose by 100,0000 barrels to 118.1 million,
against a forecast of a decline of 850,000.
