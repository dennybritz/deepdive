South African President Thabo Mbeki is to hold talks on Thursday
with his outgoing French counterpart Jacques Chirac in Paris, his
office said.


"President Mbeki has been invited by President Chirac for
consultations and to bid farewell ahead of the presidential
elections in France on 22 April 2007," according to a statement
from the presidency issued on Wednesday.


Topics expected to be discussed include the political crisis in
Zimbabwe and the situation in the former French colony of Ivory
Coast where ex-rebel leader Guillaume Soro recently became prime
minister as part of a peace deal with President Laurent Gbagbo.


Iran's nuclear programme is also set to be discussed, according
to the statement. South Africa is currently a non permanent
member of the United Nations Security Council which has already
imposed two sets of sanctions against Tehran since December over
its defiance of calls to suspend uranium enrichment.
