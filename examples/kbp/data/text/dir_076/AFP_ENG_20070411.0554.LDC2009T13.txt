Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday condemned double
suicide attacks in Algeria that killed at least 23 people,
describing them as "criminal" acts.


Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin that the
attacks "prove once again that terrorism has neither nationality
nor religion and constitutes one of the main challenges for the
international community."


The Russian foreign ministry also issued a statement saying it
"resolutely condemned these vile terrorist acts, which have once
again resulted in innocent victims."


Two suicide car bomb attacks claimed by an Al-Qaeda affiliate
rocked the Algerian capital, including the prime minister's
office, on Wednesday. In addition to those killed, more than 160
were injured.


Putin has often spoken at international forums about fighting
terrorism and has referred to the decade-old guerrilla conflict
in Chechnya as part of a worldwide terrorism problem.
