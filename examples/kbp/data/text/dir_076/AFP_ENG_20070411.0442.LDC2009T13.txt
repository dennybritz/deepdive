Democratic Republic of Congo opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba,
blamed for bloody election-related violence, arrived in Portugal
Wednesday for medical treatment, police said.


The former rebel leader and vice president, who was accompanied
by his wife  and five children when he left Kinshasa, landed at
Faro, 300 kilometres (190 miles) south of Lisbon.


He went on to a villa in Quinta do Lago, some 10 kilometres from
the airport, which was heavily guarded by Portuguese police.


Bemba, 44, who lost in presidential elections to incumbent Joseph
Kabila last December, had been holed up at the South African
embassy in Kinshasa since violent clashes between his supporters
and government troops on March 22-23.


The clashes, which killed more than 200 people according to
diplomats, were sparked by plans to remove many of Bemba's guards
and integrate them into the army.


The government later issued an arrest warrant against the former
rebel leader on charges of treason and maintaining a militia.


In theory however, Bemba enjoys parliamentary immunity because of
his seat in the senate. That immunity can only be lifted by
parliament.


Negotiations for Bemba to leave the country had been underway for
a couple of weeks, and the official reason for his departure was
to seek medical treatment for a leg injury sustained when he fell
downstairs in December.


Given 60 days leave by the senate, he has promised not to engage
in any political activity while in Portugal.


UN peacekeepers transported Bemba and his family from the South
African embassy to the airport.
