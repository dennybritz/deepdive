International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohammed ElBaradei, on a
tour of Gulf countries planning to develop a nuclear power
programme, held talks on Wednesday with Saudi Foreign Minister
Saud al-Faisal.


The official Saudi news agency SPA said merely that their talks
focused on "questions of common interest", without giving any
details.


ElBaradei is due on Thursday to meet Abdulrahman al-Attiyah,
secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, whom he met in
February to discuss a proposed nuclear programme by the six
monarchies, a GCC official told AFP.


During their annual meeting in Riyadh last December, heads of
state of the GCC countries announced their determination to
develop a joint nuclear technology programme for peaceful use
under international rules.


The six GCC countries are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.


SPA said that ElBaradei would head to Oman on Thursday and then
leave for Jordan on Sunday.
