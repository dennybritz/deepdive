The Italian appeals court Wednesday confirmed a 30-year prison
sentence against one of the bombers in a 1980 attack on Bologna
train station, the bloodiest in Italian history, the Ansa news
agency said.


Luigi Ciavardini, a far-right activist who was 17 at the time of
the bomb blast, was sentenced to 30 years in December 2004 for
his role in the attack.


Two other far-right activists, Valerio Fioravanti and Francesca
Mambro, were sentenced to life.


On August 2, 1980, a powerful bomb went off at Bologna's station,
which was crowded with holiday-makers, killing 85 people and
injuring 200.
