US stocks slid Wednesday as investors were rattled by Federal
Reserve minutes suggesting a rate hike remains on the table and a
downgrade in the US economic outlook by the International
Monetary Fund.


A jump in oil prices added to the negative sentiment on Wall
Street as blue chips ended an eight-session winning streak.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 88.74 points (0.71
percent) to 12,485.11 at the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite skidded 18.47 points (0.75 percent) to
2,459.14 and the Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index
retreated 9.52 points (0.66 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,438.87.


The selloff gained momentum after the Federal Reserve released
minutes from its March 20-21 meeting at which members expressed
concerns about "uncomfortably" high inflation even as economic
conditions were softening.


"The Fed's minutes tended to show that further rates increases
might be necessary, which has caused a bit of concern on the
stock market," said Michael Malone, analyst at Cowen and Co.


Analysts at Briefing.com said in a note that the market was
"increasingly sensitive to weak data" and moved lower after the
IMF cut its forecast for US economic growth this year to 2.2
percent, the weakest in five years, citing a weaker housing
market.


Also hurting was a spike in oil prices after US data showed a
sharp drawdown in gasoline inventories last week.


Crude oil gained 12 cents to close at 62.01 dollars a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
