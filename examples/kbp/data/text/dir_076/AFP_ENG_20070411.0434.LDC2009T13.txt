North Korea's parliament on Wednesday sacked the country's
premier Pak Pong-Ju and replaced him with transport minister Kim
Yong-Il, state media said.


The Supreme People's Assembly session "relieved deputy Pak Pong-
Ju of premiership and elected deputy Kim Yong-Il premier of the
cabinet of the DPRK (North Korea)," the official Korean Central
News Agency said.


The agency gave no explanation for the sacking of Pak, 67, who
had held the post since September 2003 and was theoretically the
head of government.


The agency also said Kim Yong-Chun was elected vice-chairman of
the country's National Defence Commission during the session,
which was presided over by the nation's leader, Kim Jong-Il.


In practice, all power in the reclusive communist state is
centred on Kim Jong- Il, son of the nation's founding father and
the focus of a vast personality cult.


Kim Yong-Nam, president of parliament's presidium, acts as head
of state and receives diplomatic credentials.


The legislature, a rubber-stamp body, convenes irregularly once
or twice a year.
