Romanian authorities have busted a ring of human traffickers who
smuggled out some 400 people to Italy, police said Wednesday.


The network, run by six Romanians, smuggled the people into Italy
between May 2005 and November 2006, said Viorel Alexe, a border
police commissioner in the western district of Timis.


The six charged sums ranging from 300 to 700 euros (402 dollars)
and 700 euros and furnished their clients with fake documents.


Romania was under pressure to improve border security and stop
human trafficking as part of reforms required before its entry
into the European Union this year.
