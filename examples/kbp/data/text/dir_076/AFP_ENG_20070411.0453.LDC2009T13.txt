Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said Wednesday that top
war crimes fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were
"cowards" for avoiding justice.


"Those who are still out of reach of justice are not heroes to us
but people who are inflicting unforeseeable damage to Republika
Srpska and Serb people. They are cowards," Dodik told parliament.


The UN war crimes tribunal is still seeking six Serb war crimes
suspects, of whom the most wanted are the wartime Bosnian Serb
political leader Karadzic and his military commander Mladic.


The two face charges of genocide for atrocities committed during
Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, notably the Srebrenica massacre of some
8,000 Muslims and the siege of Sarajevo that claimed around
10,000 lives.


Bosnian Serb authorities and international peacekeepers have said
there was no evidence that war crimes suspects are hiding in the
country.


While little is known of Karadzic's whereabouts, he is thought to
be hiding in Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia or neighbouring
Montenegro. Mladic is widely believed to living in Serbia.


Post-war Bosnia is split into two semi-independent entities --
the Serbs' Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
