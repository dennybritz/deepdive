Fewer women in Canada succumbed to breast cancer in recent
decades because of more and better screening, as well as improved
remedies, said a report Wednesday.


According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the death rate for
breast cancer for Canadian women fell 25 percent since 1986, and
the survival rate beyond five years was 86 percent for women
diagnosed between 1996-1998.


Incidence rates also declined or stabilized during the period,
the agency said.


"We know breast cancer screening works," explained Paul Lapierre,
a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. "If more women are
screened, more will survive."


He pointed to better quality mammography and increased
participation in breast screening programs, especially by women
aged 50-69, leading to earlier disease detection, which meant
successful treatment was more likely.


Advances in breast cancer treatment, such as increased use of
chemotherapy and the drug tamoxifen, also contributed to improved
breast cancer survival.


Despite the impetus, breast cancer remains the most commonly
diagnosed cancer in women and the second most common cause of
cancer death in women, after lung cancer.


An estimated 22,300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in
Canada in 2007. An estimated 5,300 Canadian women will die from
the disease.
