Al-Jazeera television said a caller who said he represented Al-
Qaeda's branch in North Africa claimed responsibility for
Wednesday's deadly bomb attacks in Algiers.


The satellite news channel ran the claim across the screen, after
receiving the anonymous call.


Suicide bombers in three explosives-laden cars carried out the
two blasts in the Algerian capital that killed 23 people and
wounded more than 160, police said at the scene of the blasts.
