Iberdrola, Spain's second-biggest electricity provider, said
Wednesday it had agreed to buy the US wind power firm CPV Wind
Ventures, boosting its renewable energy business.


The Spanish company declined to give financial details of the
acquisition but said it planned to invest some 1.5 billion euros
(2.0 billion US dollars) to develop US generation projects.


"Iberdrola is very interested in growing in the US wind power
market due to its great potential and a tax system which supports
this type of energy," it said in a statement.


Maryland-based CPV currently has no active wind parks but it does
have wind generation projects for 15 US states with a potential
capacity of 3,500 megawatts, the statement added.


In 2000, the American Wind Energy Association estimated that
3,500 megawatts of electricity would supply roughly 1.3 million
California households, or 3.5 million people.


CPV is to begin work on its first wind farms next year.


Iberdrola already has some 8,500 megawatts of wind power capacity
under development in the United States following a series of
recent acquisitions there.


The US, which uses roughly one-quarter of the world's crude oil,
is seen as a major growth market for renweable energy sources as
concerns over climate change fuel demand for alternatives to
fossil fuels.
