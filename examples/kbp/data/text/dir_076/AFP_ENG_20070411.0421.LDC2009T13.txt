The United States expects North Korea to fulfil the terms of a
landmark deal to rein in its nuclear program, a State Department
spokesman said Wednesday.


"We would expect North Korea to act in such a way that they would
meet their obligations under the February 13 agreement,"
spokesman Sean McCormack said.
