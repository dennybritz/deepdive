A Moroccan anti-terrorism court on Wednesday confirmed death
sentences against two Islamist Moroccans convicted of "preparing
terrorist acts," according to a court source.


The two men sentenced to death in December are Youssef Addad, the
leader of a group of terrorism suspects, and Abdelmalek
Bouizakarne.


The group had been on trial under Morocco's anti-terrorism laws
for "setting up a criminal group with the aim of committing
terrorist acts, attacking the  lives and the security of people
and illegally possessing of explosives".


Thirteen other members of the group were given sentences ranging
from four to 30 years in prison in December.


Although Moroccan courts continue to hand down the death sentence
it has not been carried out since 1994, when a police officer was
convicted for raping several women.


The 15 suspects had pleaded not-guilty.
