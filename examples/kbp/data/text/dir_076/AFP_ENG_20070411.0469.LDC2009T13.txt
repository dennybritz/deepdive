Al-Qaeda's branch in North Africa claimed responsibility for
Wednesday's deadly bomb attacks in Algiers, publishing
photographs of the three suicide bombers in an Internet
statement.


The statement on an Islamist website often used by the Al-Qaeda
network of Osama bin Laden said three militants carried out the
car bombings which it said killed at least 53 people.


Algerian officials said at least 23 people died and more than 160
were wounded in the attacks.
