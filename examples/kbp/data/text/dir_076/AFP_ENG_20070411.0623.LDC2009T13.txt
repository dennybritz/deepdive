Morocco's Interior Minister  Chakib Benmoussa Wednesday ruled out
any connection between a rash of suicide bombings in the Algerian
capital and the Moroccan port city of Casablanca.


"No links have been established between the explosions of March
11 and April 10 in Casablanca and the bombings in Alger,"
Benmoussa told a news conference in Casablanca.


"We have found no logistical or structural elements to prove a
link with  the bombings at Alger but we do not rule out a
movement espousing jihad (Islamic holy war) and terrorism," he
said.


He said "even the timing of the blasts" in the two countries were
not linked as the Moroccan bombings were sparked by a police raid
which prompted the militants to blow themselves up.


Two suicide car bomb attacks claimed by an Al-Qaeda affiliate
rocked the Algerian capital, including the prime minister's
office, on Wednesday, killing at least 23 people and injuring
more than 160.


The bombings came on the heels of kamikaze blasts in neighbouring
Morocco.


Three suspected militants blew themselves on Tuesday as they were
being chased in Casablanca.  All were wanted in connection with a
March 11 bombing at a Casablanca Internet cafe staged by another
suspected militant.


Algeria along with neighbouring Tunisia and Morocco are battling
to contain attacks by Islamist militant groups.
