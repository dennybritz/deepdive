Two pilots on board an Indian airforce helicopter were killed
when the chopper crashed early Wednesday on Siachen glacier in
disputed Kashmir, the defence ministry said.


"Both the pilots suffered fatal injuries," said a statement
released by the ministry.


"A court of inquiry has been ordered to investigate the
incident."


The Cheetah helicopter crashed after taking off from Siachen base
camp and was on a routine flying mission, the ministry said,
thanking Pakistan for its help in the search operation.


"The government deeply appreciated the cooperation extended by
the Pakistan authorities in aerial and ground based rescue
operations," said the statement.


The 6,300-metre-high (20,800-feet) Siachen glacier, like the
disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, is held in part by India
and Pakistan.


Freezing temperatures have claimed more of the lives of Indian
and Pakistani troops stationed here than actual combat.
