Morocco's supreme court has delayed until May 2 deliberating on a
British extradition request for two men suspected in the largest
robbery in British history, a lawyer for one of the men said
Wednesday.


Lee Lamrani Ibrahim Murray, who holds dual Moroccan and British
citizenship, and another British suspect, Paul Allen, are being
held in jail while the request is under consideration.


Murray, who has a Moroccan father, is accused of masterminding
the theft of 53 million pounds (77 million euros, 104 million
dollars) from a Securitas cash depot in Tonbridge, Kent,
southeast England, in February 2006.


His lawyer, Abdellah Belmhidi Aissaoui, said he requested a delay
in the case since British authorities filed documents Wednesday
morning to justify the extradition requests.


The lawyer has argued repeatedly that the extradition of Murray
is not legal because a Moroccan citizen cannot be extradited to
face trial in another country, regardless of the alleged offence.


The two men have served eight months in jail in Morocco for drug
use and for assaulting a police officer.


Murray was a martial arts cage fighter well known to fight fans
in Britain. He has told the court he wishes to stay in Morocco.
