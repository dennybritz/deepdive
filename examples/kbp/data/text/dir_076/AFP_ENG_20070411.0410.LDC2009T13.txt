Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I think this is the end of my one-day career. I honestly feel
that my game is over and we should give it to one of the younger
players. It's really tough playing one-day internationals out
there when you are 37-38 years old."


- West Indies captain Brian Lara confirms his one-day
international retirement after his side's 67-run loss to South
Africa.


"It's too long. It's too long for everyone."


- Australia's Matthew Hayden wanting the 47-day tournament
trimmed.


"It's a similar situation here to the one in Australia. Now we've
got to win every game and every game is a final. I think as a
team it's good that we can break it down now to what we need to
do."


- England's Ian Bell on the need to win all three of their
remaining Super Eights games to stay in contention for a Super
Eights place.


"It's a very special day for me and I enjoyed every second of it.
I had a tough time out there. It started when I was on 40 but I'm
OK now and luckily got through it to get to my hundred."


- South Africa opener AB de Villiers after making 146 against the
West Indies despite suffering from cramps and dehydration.


"Younis Khan wanted to be an all-powerful captain and is
reluctant to accept curbs."


- A Pakistan cricket board official highlighting the problems of
finding a new captain to replace Inzamam-ul-Haq.
