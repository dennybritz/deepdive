Carrefour, the world's second biggest retailer, said Wednesday
that first quarter sales for the 2007 financial year rose by 5.2
percent to 21.478 billion euros (28.8 billion dollars).


Core French sales grew by 1.6 percent to 9.852 billion euros in
absolute terms, although on a same-stores basis sales declined by
0.4 percent owing to a deflationary environment in the group's
domestic market.


Carrefour said the deflationary impact in the first quarter in
France "is one of the strongest seen over the last few years."


The retailer reported stronger growth in international markets
however, in particular Latin America where same-store sales
soared by 9.6 percent.


In Europe excluding France, sales rose by 2.0 percent, while in
Asia, they expanded by 3.0 percent.


The group said same-store growth exceeded 5.0 percent in six
countries: Argentina, China, Colombia, Greece and Poland.


In terms of new stores, Carrefour said it had opened 170 outlets
in the first quarter, contributing 4.9 percent to sales growth.


The world's biggest retail chain is Wal-Mart.
