England were 30-1 after 10 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against Bangladesh at the Kensington Oval here on Wednesday
chasing 144 to win.


Skipper Michael Vaughan was on nine with Andrew Strauss on 11.


Ian Bell was the first man out, caught by Aftab Ahmed off Syed
Rasel for nought in the fourth over.


Earlier, Sajid Mahmood and Monty Panesar took three wickets
apiece as England bundled Bangaldesh out for a paltry 143.


Pace bowler Mahmood took 3-27 and left-arm spinner Panesar
finished with 3-25 after Vaughan won the toss and decided to bowl
in an attempt to exploit early moisture and bounce.


Left-hander Saqibul Hasan top-scored with an unbeaten 57 and
added 47 for the seventh wicket with Mashrafe Mortaza (13) to
give Bangladesh's total a degree of respectability on a day when
England did everything right from the start.
