Romanian coach Laszlo Boloni on Wednesday denied he is set for a
move to Al- Nasser in the United Arab Emirates.


The 54-year-old, out of contract since being fired by French side
Monaco last October, issued the denial on the website of his
former club Nancy.


"The former Nancy coach has not signed with Al-Nasser in the
United Arab Emirates. Laszlo Boloni makes it clear that he has no
intention of doing so," the statement said.


Boloni, capped 104 times for the Romanian national side, started
his coaching career with Nancy before going on to coach Romania,
Sporting Lisbon in Portugal and French side Rennes and Monaco.
