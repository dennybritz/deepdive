The Arab League on Wednesday condemned a series of bomb attacks
that hit the North African countries of Algeria and Morocco in
two days.


"The Arab League strongly condemns... these terrorist acts and
what they represent and aim to achieve," the league's secretary
general, Amr Mussa, said in a statement.


Two car bomb attacks rocked the Algerian capital on Wednesday,
killing at least 23 people and wounding more than 100 outside the
government headquarters and on the road to the international
airport.


In Morocco on Wednesday, police were hunting 10 possible suicide
bombers in Casablanca, a day after three suspected militants blew
themselves up as they were being chased.
