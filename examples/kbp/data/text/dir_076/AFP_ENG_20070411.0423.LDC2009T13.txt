A Polish man facing charges of rape and attempted murder in
Britain was handed over to British judicial authorities
Wednesday, officials said.


The man, identified by British media as 24-year-old Jakub
Tomczak, was handed over to a British police escort at Warsaw
airport, Polish police spokeswoman Ewa Olkiewicz was quoted by
the PAP news agency as saying.


Tomczak was arrested on a European Union warrant in his home town
of Poznan, in western Poland, on February 9,


He is suspected of a brutal assault on a 48-year-old woman in the
southwestern English city of Exeter last July. He denies the
charges.


A Poznan court rejected his appeal against extradition last week.


According to a website created by Tomczak's Polish friends,
called www.whyjakub.com, the law student had last year held a
summer job in an Exeter hotel.


Back in Poland, he was contacted by British police last November
and agreed to give a DNA sample in order to help investigators
who were trying to whittle down a list of potential suspects, the
website said.


Tomczak's lawyers claim that DNA tests allegedly implicating
their client are flawed. They have also pointed to discrepancies
in evidence gathered from video surveillance and witness
accounts.


Poland's ombudsman has also begun looking into the case.
