Morocco on Wednesday presented its plan to grant self-rule to the
disputed Western Sahara territory to United Nations chief Ban Ki-
moon, an official said in Rabat.


"The entire plan for autonomy has just been submitted by the
ambassador to the UN Mustapha Sahel," the official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.


Moroccan Information Minister Nabil Benabdellah told a government
meeting that the document was entitled the "Moroccan Initiative
for Negotiating Self-Autonomy for Wsetern Sahara."


Benabdellah, who doubles as the government spokesman, added that
the document would "serve as a platform for negotiations between
the concerned parties."


Morocco annexed the desolate but phosphate-rich northwest African
territory after the withdrawal of the region's former colonial
power Spain and neighbour Mauritania in the 1970s, settling it
with around 300,000 Moroccans in 1975.


A war ensued with the Algerian-backed armed Polisario Front
independence movement, which contested Rabat's sovereignty,
ending only in 1991 with a UN- brokered ceasefire.


Since then, the United Nations has tried several times to
organise a referendum on self-determination.


The Moroccan official said that copies of the document had not
yet been sent to either Algeria or the Polisario Front but added
that Rabat had not ruled out doing so in the future.
