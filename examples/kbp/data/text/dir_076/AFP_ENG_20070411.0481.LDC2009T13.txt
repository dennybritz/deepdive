French free-diving champion Loic Leferme died Wednesday in a
training accident off Nice on the Mediterranean coast.


Leferme, 36, suffered heart failure when the rope pulling him to
the surface at the end of a practice dive snagged, colleagues
said.


"The rope got caught on something under the water, I have no idea
what," said Cedric Palerm, who was on the accompanying boat.


Another diver immediately went down and found Leferme at a depth
of around 20 metres.


"He'd gone beyond the black-out stage. We gave him heart massage,
got out the oxygen. Then we raced to the emergency services in
Nice. We were there in 10 minutes," said Palerm.


Leferme held for several years the record of the "world's deepest
man", achieving a depth of 171 metres (564 feet) without
breathing apparatus in 2004. In 2005 he was surpassed by Austrian
Herbert Nitsch.


The accident occurred as Leferme trained to recover his title.


Competitive free-diving -- or apnea -- is an extreme sport in
which contestants spend time under water without breathing
apparatus.


Born in 1970 into a family of swimming champions, Leferme founded
the Nice-based International Centre for Free-Diving in 1999. He
had two children.


"This was his first ever accident. He wasn't a daredevil. He was
extremely safety conscious," said Palerm.
