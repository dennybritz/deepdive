Suicide bombers in three explosives-laden cars were responsible
for blasts in Algiers on Wednesday which killed 23 people and
wounded more than 160, police said at the scene of the blasts.


At the government headquarters, where 12 people were killed and
118 hurt, a policeman who declined to be identified said: "The
attack was perpetrated by a suicide bomber who drove his car into
the guard post."


In the eastern suburb of Bab Ezzouar another policeman said
suicide bombers driving two cars carried out the attack on a
local police station that killed 11 people and wounded 44,
according to the latest figures from the civil defence agency.


At the government headquarters in central Algiers, whose eight-
storey facade was wrecked by the blast, police pointed to the
burned-out shell of a Renault Clio car which had been driven into
the guard post.


The policeman said the bomber seemed to have carried out a
reconnaissance, driving round the roundabout at the entrance
before returning 10 minutes later and driving at full speed into
the sentry post.


Windows were blown out in buildings all around the government
headquarters, which also houses several ministries.


In Bab Ezzoar, on the road to the airport, the front of the
police station had also caved in as a result of the blast, while
shops and apartment blocks in the area were damaged.
