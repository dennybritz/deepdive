The site of one of Beverly Hills' most famous department stores
has been sold for 500 million dollars to make way for luxury
apartments and a shopping center, reports said Wednesday.


The deal, one of the biggest in Los Angeles' history, will see
the Robinsons-May store razed to the ground and replaced by
residential and retail properties, the Los Angeles Times
reported.


"We intend to see this vision through and bring Beverly Hills
what will truly be the world's most luxurious address," Nick
Candy of Candy & Candy, the London-based firm behind the
acquisition told The Times.


The new complex would include 252 apartments overlooking the
green acres of the exclusive Los Angeles Country Club, reports
said.


The deal was reported to be the second most expensive in Los
Angeles history, following Japanese firm Shuwa Investment Corp's
640 million dollar acquisition of the Arco Plaza Complex in 1986,
the Times reported.
