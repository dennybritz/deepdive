UN chief Ban Ki-moon is to pay an official visit to Syria later
this month for talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and
other government leaders, his office announced Wednesday.


UN deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe told a press briefing that Ban
would visit Damascus April 24 and 25 on the last leg of a four-
nation swing that will earlier take him to Italy, Switzerland and
Qatar.


Ban, who recently returned from a Middle East tour, hopes that
his Syrian visit "wll be useful and constructive" in helping move
the regional peace process forward, Okabe said.


During his Middle East tour last month, the UN secretary general
visited Israel and the West Bank in a bid to revive Middle East
peace talks before attending an Arab summit in Riyadh.


He also visited Lebanon where he urged leaders on both sides of
the political divide to pursue dialogue in order to reach
national reconciliation and end the country's most damaging
crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.


Ban's first stop on his upcoming tour will be Italy where he was
to pay a two- day official visit from next Tuesday for separate
talks with Italian leaders and Pope Benedict XVI, Okabe said.


On April 19, the UN chief was to head for an official visit to
Switzerland that will feature talks with Swiss leaders in Bern
and a meeting of heads of UN agencies in Geneva.


On April 22, Ban was to fly to Doha, Qatar to attend an
international forum on democracy, development and free trade, the
spokeswoman said.


The UN chief was to head back to New York on April 26.
