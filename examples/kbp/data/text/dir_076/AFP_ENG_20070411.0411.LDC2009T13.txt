T-Mobile's Marcus Burghardt won the 69th edition of the Gent-
Wevelgem one-day classic here on Wednesday.


The German rider crossed the finish line alone after launching a
late solo attack on a small leading group in the final kilometre
of the 200km race.


British teammate Roger Hammond finished in second place just
ahead of on-form Spaniard Oscar Freire, who had virtually given
up pedalling as Burghardt raced towards the finish line.


All three riders had been part of a five-man lead group which had
managed to stay at the front and out of danger as the treacherous
cobblestone sections took their toll on the peloton.


Unibet's Jimmy Casper appeared worst off from among the many who
crashed, the Frenchman sustaining face, hand and shoulder
injuries when he came down hard on a downhill section some 50km
from the finish.


Freire, a three-time world champion, had been hoping for his
breakaway to end in a bunch sprint, one of his specialities which
allowed him to win Milan-San Remo for the second time last March.


However the Spaniard was outfoxed by T-Mobile as they raced for
the finish line.


With the final kilometre approaching, and the main peloton a
comfortable 20secs further back, Burghardt got up on the pedals
and raced ahead to take a quick lead of 200 metres.


Freire hesitated for a few seconds before deciding to pursue, and
when he did Hammond - who like him is a sprinter - stuck to his
wheel like glue.
