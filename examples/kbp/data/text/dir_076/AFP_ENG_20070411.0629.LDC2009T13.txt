Five Mauritanians and a Moroccan arrested last month for
suspected links to terrorism were charged on Wednesday, legal
sources said.


The public prosecutor's department said two Mauritanians and a
Moroccan were charged for belonging to an organisation which was
planning attacks in the northwestern African country.


Prosecution officials did not confirm any link to Wednesday's two
suicide car bomb attacks in neighbouring Algeria, claimed by an
Al-Qaeda affiliate.


An Algerian Islamist group believed to be linked to Al-Qaeda has
operated in the region in recent years.


Two other Mauritanians, one of whom was on the run and subject of
an international arrest warrant, were accused of "selling weapons
and ammunition prohibited by law", said another source.


A sixth man was charged for "money laundering and financing
terrorism" according to the prosecution.


Because of threats from the Islamist group, two stages of the
Dakar 2007 Rally between Mauritania and Mali were cancelled on
the recommendation of French authorities.


The group attacked a military base in northeastern Mauritania in
2005, causing 15 deaths and 17 injuries.


Authorities in Mauritania have since then arrested about 30
suspected members of the group, which recently began calling
itself the Armed Branch of Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb. It was
previously known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat.
