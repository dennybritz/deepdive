Four Italian men charged after clashes with police marred
Manchester United's Champions League quarter-final victory over
AS Roma, walked free from court Wednesday.


Magistrates in Manchester handed conditional discharges to two of
the men. A third was bound over to be of good behaviour while the
fourth pleaded not guilty to possessing an offensive weapon.


He was bailed to return to trial in the north-west English city
on June 28.


Twelve English fans were also charged after violence flared
briefly between up to 100 rival fans outside the Old Trafford
stadium in Manchester before Tuesday evening's game, which United
won 7-1.


They are due to appear in court next Wednesday.


Police with dogs and batons arrested a total of 21 people on the
night.


The 16 taken to court were charged with offences including
possession of a bladed weapon, criminal damage and public order
offences, a spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police told AFP.


At last week's clash in Rome, which Roma won 2-1, several United
fans needed hospital treatment after being stabbed before the
match, while Italian police baton-charged the visiting supporters
during the first half.


United's dazzling second leg victory swept them through to the
Champions League semi-finals.
