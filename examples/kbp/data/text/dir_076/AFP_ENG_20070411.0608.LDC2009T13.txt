Serena and Venus Williams were officially confirmed on Wednesday
for the United States' team in this month's first round Fed Cup
tie against Belgium.


Serena, who is appearing in the competition for the first time
since 2003  and who has an unblemished six-win record, will play
despite pulling out of the WTA event in Charleston on Tuesday.


The Australian Open champion retired in the second round match
with a right groin strain.


The sisters will be joined in the April 21-22 rubber in Delray
Beach by Lisa Raymond and Vania King, US captain Zina Garrison
announced.


Belgium, missing their two best players Justine Henin and Kim
Clijsters, can count on Caroline Maes, Yanina Wickmayer and
Tamaryn Hendler.
