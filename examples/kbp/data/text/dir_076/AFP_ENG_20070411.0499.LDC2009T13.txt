Pope Benedict XVI will meet Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva in Sao Paolo on May 10, the second day of the pontiff's
planned trip to Brazil, the Vatican said Wednesday.


The pope, who will be making his first trip to the Americas, will
open a conference of Latin American bishops in Aparecida, near
Sao Paolo, according to a detailed programme released by the Holy
See.


Benedict is to touch down in Sao Paolo on May 9 but will have no
important meetings until the next day.


After a "courtesy call" on President Lula in the late morning,
and a brief meeting with representatives of other faiths, the
leader of the Roman Catholic Church will address a rally of young
Brazilian Catholics at a Sao Paolo stadium.


On May 11 Benedict will celebrate a canonisation mass in Sao
Paolo for an 18th- century Brazilian priest, Frei Galvao.


That afternoon he will meet Brazilian bishops before flying by
helicopter to the sanctuary city of Aparecida, venue for the
18-day Latin American Episcopal Conference.


On May 12 the pope will have a variety of meetings with the
faithful and clergy of the Aparecida region and lunch with the
Latin American and Caribbean bishops.


The following morning Benedict will celebrate mass outside the
National Sanctuary dedicated to the Virgin Mary before presiding
over the opening of the bishops' conference.


He is to fly home late on May 13 from Sao Paolo, arriving in Rome
on May 14.
