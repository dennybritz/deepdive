EU leaders on Wednesday condemned the "barbaric" suicide car bomb
attacks in Algeria which left at least 23 people dead.


"I condemn with the strongest force the bloody attacks
perpetrated today in Algiers which caused a high number of
casualties," said EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.


"These were odious and cowardly acts," he added, offering his
condolences to the families of the victims.


EU External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said
"this type of act is barbaric and does not achieve any purpose.


"Algeria can count on Europe for its support in the fight against
terrorism, which today is a worldwide problem," she said in a
statement.


The bombings, which followed closely on the heels of suicide
blasts in neighbouring Morocco, fuelled regional fears of a
resurgence in militant activity following crackdowns by North
African governments.


Al-Qaeda's branch in North Africa claimed responsibility for the
two Algiers' attacks which also injured more than 160 people.


A statement on an Islamist website often used by the Al-Qaeda
network of Osama bin Laden said three militants carried out the
car bombings.
