The government and rebels in Ivory Coast on Wednesday signed an
agreement with foreign peacekeepers to dismantle a buffer zone
dividing the west African nation since 2002.


The pulling down of the so-called confidence zone dividing rebel-
held areas in the north from the rest of the country should begin
at midnight on Monday in line with a peace deal signed by
President Laurent Gbagbo and rebel leader Guillaume Soro last
month.


The demilitarised strip extending from the east to the west of
the cocoa-rich country was created when peacekeeping troops under
the aegis of the United Nations moved in to keep the warring
sides apart.


It has until now been patrolled by UN and French troops despite
the end of actual fighting between the rebels and pro-government
troops in 2004.


After years of an impasse in the peace process, the two sides
unexpectedly signed an agreement early last month, which gave the
rebel chief the post of prime minister and the gradual withdrawal
of foreign troops.


The country, once a bastion of stability in the traditionally
troubled west Africa, slid into a civil war in 2002 following a
failed coup against Gbagbo led by Soro.
