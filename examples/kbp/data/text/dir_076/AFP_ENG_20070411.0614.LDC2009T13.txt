England were 136-6 after 40 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against Bangladesh at the Kensington Oval here on Wednesday
chasing 144 to win.


Paul Collingwood was on 21 with Paul Nixon on 15.


Ian Bell, celebrating his 25th birthday, was the first man out,
caught by Aftab Ahmed at point off Syed Rasel for nought in the
fourth over.


Andrew Strauss fell lbw to Rasel for 23 in the 14th over with the
total on 48.


Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak then dismissed skipper Michael
Vaughan for 30 thanks to a catch by Habibul Bashar before having
Kevin Pietersen snapped up by substitute fielder Farhad Reza for
10 with the total on 79.


Mohammad Rafique then picked up the wickets of Andrew Flintoff
(23) and Ravi Bopara (0) in the space of four balls to give
England a few jitters.


Earlier, Sajid Mahmood and Monty Panesar took three wickets
apiece as England bundled Bangaldesh out for a paltry 143.


Pace bowler Mahmood took 3-27 and left-arm spinner Panesar
finished with 3-25 after Vaughan won the toss and decided to bowl
in an attempt to exploit early moisture and bounce.


Left-hander Saqibul Hasan top-scored with an unbeaten 57 and
added 47 for the seventh wicket with Mashrafe Mortaza (13) to
give Bangladesh's total a degree of respectability on a day when
England did everything right from the start.
