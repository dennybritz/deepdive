Twenty-two vases worth up to a total of a million euros were
stolen Wednesday from a palace in the Austrian capital, where
there was no alarm system protecting them, a representative of
the owners said.


About 30 Faberge eggs were also stolen from the palace holding
the Harrach noble family's collection, with the most expensive
valued at 22,000 euros (30,000 dollars), said Josef Payer.


The vases were part of what is considered Austria's most
important private art collection and were soon to be exhibited in
Hong Kong. Their value was estimated at between 500,000 and a
million euros (1.3 million dollars).


Some of them weighed as much as 50 kilograms (110 pounds) and
were nearly a metre (yard) in height. The most expensive were
worth up to 95,000 euros (128,000 dollars), Payer said.


The art collections in the Harrach palace have been open to the
public daily for decades.
