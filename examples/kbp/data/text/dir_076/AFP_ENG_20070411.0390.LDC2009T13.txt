Canadian authorities involved in an extensive search of a Cyprus-
registered cargo ship that landed in Halifax found no stowaways
aboard, Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day said Wednesday.


"The search in and of itself did not turn up anything in terms of
people, or contraband," the minister told reporters.


The vessel arriving from Lisbon was suspected of carrying as many
as 200 illegal immigrants, reports said.


It arrived in Halifax midday Tuesday with a harbor police escort
and under the glare of national media. The cargo terminal is
Canada's second-largest Atlantic port.


Local hospitals were put on alert in case anyone was found aboard
in need of medical help and emergency housing was set up, while
Canada Border Services Agency unloaded and searched hundreds of
shipping containers throughout the day and night.


"What you witnessed yesterday was a full operational search in a
shipping situation where all the containers on a particular ship
were offloaded and were searched, at least all of those
containers that were destined for Canada," Day said, indicating
more such operations could be repeated.


The Cala Puebla began its journey in Italy, stopping in Spain
before arriving in Portugal, then leaving for Canada on April 1.


The captain told public broadcaster CBC he received a call
thereafter from Portuguese officials alerting him to possible
stowaways, but added he found none.


An agent for the Cala Puebla meanwhile told Canadian media the
company was informed a few days ago that there may be people
stowed in containers on the massive ship, but said he doubted
that their information was accurate.
