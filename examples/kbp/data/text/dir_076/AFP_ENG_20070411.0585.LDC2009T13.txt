French club Monaco have been hit by the injury of international
striker Frederic Piquionne, sidelined for ten days after
straining his thigh in training on Wednesday.


Piquionne's injury follows that of Juan Pablo Pino with a third
striker Jan Koller, suspended ahead of Monaco's trip to Lorient
at the weekend.
