UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday strongly condemned the suicide
car bomb attacks in Algeria, stressing that they underscored the
need for concerted international action against terrorism.


"The Secretary General strongly condemns the terrorist bombings
that occurred today in Algeria, killing and wounding many
innocent civilians in what has been reported as an attempt
against the prime minister," UN deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe
told a press briefing.


Ban "believes this deplorable incident, the latest in a series of
similar attacks in the Maghreb region as a whole, shows the need
for concerted international action against terrorism which has
the effect of undermining the normal functioning of societies and
disrupting the lives of ordinary people," she added in a
statement.


The two suicide car bomb attacks claimed by an Al-Qaeda affiliate
rocked the Algerian capital, including the prime minister's
office, on Wednesday, killing at least 23 people and injuring
more than 160.


The bombings, which followed closely on the heels of suicide
blasts in neighboring Morocco, fueled regional fears of a
resurgence in militant activity following crackdowns by north
African governments.
