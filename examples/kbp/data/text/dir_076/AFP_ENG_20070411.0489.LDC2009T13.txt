Lasith Malinga, the leading bowler at the World Cup, has been
ruled out of Sri Lanka's Super Eights clash against New Zealand
here Thursday with an ankle injury.


Malinga, who missed practice Tuesday, trained at the Grenada
National Stadium here Wednesday and bowled just three deliveries
at reduced pace. He was then seen sitting in the stand with his
left ankle heavily strapped.


Afterwards Sri Lanka team manager Michael Tissera told AFP: "He
won't play tomorrow (Thursday) He's very keen to play but we've
told him 'no'. He's torn a ligament.


"He suffered the injury the day before yesterday (Monday) and we
sent him to Jamiaca for a scan because we couldn't do it here.


"Hopefully, he will be fit for the Australia or Ireland games (on
April 16 and 18 in Grenada respectively)."


Malinga, whose distinctive slingy action makes him difficult to
face, tops the tournament bowling averages with 15 wickets at an
average of under 15 apiece.


Against South Africa, in a Super Eights match in Guyana last
month, he became the first bowler to take four wickets in four
balls in an international fixture.


Farveez Maharoof or Nuwan Kulasekara, both right-arm ace bowlers,
are the leading contenders to take the 23-year-old Malinga's
place in the side.


New Zealand, yet to win the World Cup, top the Super Eights table
on run-rate ahead of champions Australia - the only other
unbeaten side in the tournament.


Sri Lanka, the 1996 World Cup winners, are third in a table where
the top four will qualify for the semi-finals.


The Super Eights conclude on April 21 with the World Cup final in
Barbados on April 28.
