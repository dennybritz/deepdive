Google announced on Wednesday that it will host an international
software developers day devoted to ways they can tailor programs
to the popular Internet search engine.


"Google Developer Day" will take place on May 31, 2007 and
feature workshops, speeches and discussion groups focused on the
Mountain View, California-based search behemoth's applications
and developer tools.


The theme of the event will be "Building Blocks for Better Web
Applications."


"We're very excited to hold this first-ever worldwide Google
developer gathering," said Google vice president Marissa Mayer.


The day will be an opportunity for software developers to
collaborate and ask Google engineers questions, according to
Mayer.


Google rival Yahoo in Sunnyvale, California hosts an annual "Hack
Day" at which software developers spend 24 hours tinkering with
and combining Yahoo applications in innovative ways.


Google Developer Day will take place at Google offices and
offsite locations in Mountain View, Sao Paulo, Madrid, London,
Paris, Hamburg, Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo and Sydney.


Google will stream live webcasts of the event from its Mountain
View office and provide a YouTube channel with videos of Google
Developer Day sessions around the world.


Google bought YouTube last year in a 1.65 billion dollar deal.
