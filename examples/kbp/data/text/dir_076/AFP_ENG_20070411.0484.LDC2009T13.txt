Former French prime minister Raymond Barre was rushed to a Paris
military hospital on Wednesday after he fell ill in Monaco,
according to his entourage.


The economist and former politician who lives in the Riviera
resort of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat was in Monaco where he was due to
give an address on Thursday.


Barre, who served under president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, was
taken to the emergency unit of Monaco's Cardio-Thoracic Center
after becoming ill and transferred to Paris' Val-de-Grace
hospital in the early afternoon.


Barre served as prime minister from 1976 to 1981 and as mayor of
France's second city of Lyon from 1995 to 2001.


He turns 83 on Thursday.
