Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said on Wednesday that he is in
contact with five rebel groups that are fighting US-led foreign
forces in Iraq in a bid to rope them into the political process.


"We have developed contacts with five groups of insurgents," said
Talabani in a statement issued by his office after he met a group
of international television journalists.


"We are making these contacts in an attempt to bring them into
the political process," the statement added.


Talabani said these groups initially developed contacts with the
"British, then the Iraqi government and then the presidency."


"We are in the final stage of entering into a dialogue with
them."


Talabani, a Kurd, did not reveal the names of the groups in
question.


Prior to ending his posting last month, former US ambassador to
Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad revealed that US officials were also in
touch with some Sunni insurgent groups and pursuing them to join
the national reconciliation process.


"We have talked to groups who have not participated in the
political process. We have talked to groups who have ties to
insurgents... groups who are reconcilable," Khalilzad told a
farewell news conference on March 26.


"These are groups who resisted the democratic change," he said.
"It is our goal to make them reconcile and embrace the new Iraq."


Talabani's remarks came as the US military charged that some
Sunni groups have been receiving support from Shiite Iran to
fight US forces in Iraq.
