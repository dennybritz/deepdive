UN chief Ban Ki-moon is to pay an official visit to Syria later
this month for talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and
other government leaders, his office announced Wednesday.


UN deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe told a press briefing that Ban
would visit Damascus April 24 and 25 on the last leg of a four-
nation swing that will earlier take him to Italy, Switzerland and
Qatar.


Ban, who recently returned from a Middle East tour, hopes that
his Syrian visit "will be useful and constructive" in helping
move the regional peace process forward, Okabe said.
