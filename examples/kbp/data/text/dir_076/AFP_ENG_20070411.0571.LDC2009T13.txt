Public workers in the Central African Republic have threatened to
strike if they are not paid eight months in back wages, a union
leader said Wednesday.


The workers' union issued an advance notice of a strike on
Tuesday and plan to meet on Saturday to decide details, said Noel
Ramadan, deputy secretary general for the union. The notice
envisions an eight-day delay before the strike would begin.


Prime Minister Elie Dote has offered to negotiate with workers
beginning Friday.


The Central African Republican government struggles financially
and strains to make regular salary payments to its 20,000
workers. They were recently paid their July 2006 salaries.


Workers are demanding all wages owed to them, as well as bonuses
and raises related to promotions that have been blocked since
1985.


Union representatives are also asking for a payment schedule for
some 36 months of back wages owed to workers employed under
former presidents between 1981 and 2003.
