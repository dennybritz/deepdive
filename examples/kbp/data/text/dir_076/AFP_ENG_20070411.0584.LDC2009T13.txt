A former top Spanish police officer told the trial of 29 accused
over the 2004 Madrid bombings Wednesday that armed Basque group
ETA was never seen as the sole suspect.


The former sub-director of Spain's police force, Pedro Diaz
Pintado, told the court that police immediately began looking
into other possible suspects, despite the then-government's
premature claims that ETA was responsible.


He said officers knew that the explosives used in the train
bombings were not the kind normally used by ETA.


The interior minister at the time, Angel Acebes, gave the green
light for police to open up a new line of inquiry on the evening
of the morning rush hour attacks which killed 191 people and
wounded hundreds more, he added.


The right-wing Popular Party government of the day insisted in
the 72 hours after the attack that ETA was to blame even as
evidence began to point to Islamist radicals angered by Madrid's
backing of the US-led invasion of Iraq.


Three days after the bombings the Socialist Party scored a
surprise general election win and swiftly carried out a campaign
pledge to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq.


The trial of 29 mainly Moroccans accused of involvement in the
coordinated train bombings, the worst in Spanish history, began
in February and is expected to last until July.


The prosecution is convinced the bombings were carried out by an
Al-Qaeda-linked group of Moroccan origin without ETA support.
