New EU-wide regulations came into force on Wednesday restricting
the working week for lorry and coach drivers and requiring longer
rest stops.


Among the new measures is an obligatory rest of at least 45
consecutive hours every two weeks and a working week of no more
than 60 hours, including loading and unloading.


"The application of the new social rules is an important
milestone for  Europe's road transport sector," said EU Transport
Commissioner Jacques Barrot.


"This is clearly a win-win situation: the drivers will enjoy
important social advances, the transport companies will compete
on equal grounds and all road users will benefit from better
safety."


The new rules, adopted by EU member states and the European
Parliament in 2005, amends 1985 legislation which allowed a
74-hour driving week for professional drivers.


Now, over a four-month period drivers mustn't work more than 48
hours a week on average.


Minimum rest times are fixed at 11 hours per day, including nine
hours consecutively.


Drivers must also take a total of 45 minutes rest for every four
and a half hours of driving.


The rules are a minimum requirement and member states are free to
impose further restrictions.


They are aimed at "increasing road safety and ensuring adequate
social standards in a profession characterised by fierce
competition," the European Commission said in a statement.


The binding rules apply, irrespective of the country where the
vehicles are registered.
