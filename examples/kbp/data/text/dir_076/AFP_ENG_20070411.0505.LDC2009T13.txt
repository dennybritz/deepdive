Prosecutors have asked an court here to enter a genocide
conviction against a Dutch businessman already convicted of
suppling chemicals used in gas attacks on Iraqi Kurds, a report
said Wednesday.


Frans van Anraat, 65, was sentenced in December 2005 to 15 years
in jail for complicity in war crimes.


He had supplied chemicals to former Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein's regime between 1985 and 1989 which were used in
weapons, notably in the massacre of 5,000 Kurds in 1988 at
Halabja, northwest Iraq.


The prosecution appealed the ruling because Van Anraat was
acquitted of a charge of complicity in genocide.


The lower court said in December that Van Anraat could not deny
knowing his products would be used for chemical weapons, but said
it had not been proven that he knew of the Iraqi regime's
genocidal intentions.


The defence, which has always maintained that Van Anraat did not
know what the chemicals he provided would be used for, will
present its case for acquittal on appeal next week.


A ruling by the Dutch supreme court paved the way for national
courts in the Netherlands to try Dutch residents for genocide and
war crimes committed in other countries.
