Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir said Wednesday he was counting
on South African mediation to help contain tensions with Chad
after recent border clashes between Sudan and its eastern
neighbour.


Beshir was speaking at a joint press conference with South
African President Thabo Mbeki who was wrapping up a visit to
Sudan.


"President Mbeki has always had contacts with Chad on ways to
contain the tensions between both our countries and these
contacts are continuing," Beshir told reporters.


"God willing, these contacts will yield positive results," he
said, a day after an incursion by the Chadian army into Sudanese
territory in pursuit of rebels.


Khartoum said 17 of its troops were killed in the clash, while
Chad speaks of 30 killed on both sides.


Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi was to send an envoy, Abdel Salem
Triki, to Sudan and Chad on Wednesday for talks aimed at easing
tensions between the two countries.


Triki, assistant to Libya's foreign minister in charge of African
affairs, said he would deliver letters from Kadhafi calling on
the leaders of the two countries to "return to peace and
dialogue."


During a visit to N'Djamena on Wednesday, Triki said Chadian
President Idris Deby Itno was ready to improve relations with
Sudan.
