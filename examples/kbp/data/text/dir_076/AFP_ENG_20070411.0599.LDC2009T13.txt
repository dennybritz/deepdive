US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on Wednesday announced that
US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan will have their deployment
extended from 12 months to 15.


"Effective immediately, active army units now in the Central
Command area (Iraq and Afghanistan) and those headed there will
deploy for not more than 15 months and will return home to home
station for not less than 12 months," said Gates.


The extension is designed to make enough troops available to
maintain the "surge" in forces that President George W. Bush
announced in January.


The new strategy in Iraq calls for the deployment of nearly
30,000 more US troops in an attempt to secure Baghdad and parts
of Al-Anbar province, and halt the rise in sectarian killings.


There are currently 145,000 US troops in Iraq, a number that
should rise to 160,000 by June once the reinforcements are in
place.


On Monday the Pentagon announced that it gave orders to 13,000
members of the National Guard to be prepared for possible
deployment to Iraq in December.
