Macedonia has paid off 110 million euros (148 million dollars) of
debt owed to the World Bank and European Investment Bank ahead of
schedule, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said Wednesday.


The decision to make the early payment would reduce the tiny
Balkan country's total foreign debt to 926 million euros (1.2
billion dollars), said Gruevski.


"With this decision, Macedonia has entered a group of only
slightly indebted states," he told journalists.


Macedonia has now repaid 20 percent of its debt towards the World
Bank and six percent of that owed to the European Investment
Bank.


The former Yugoslav republic also paid 82 million euros (104
million dollars) in debt owed to the Paris Club of creditor
nations ahead of a deadline on January 31, 2006.


The government of Gruevski, a former World Bank economist who
came to power in mid-2006, forecasts gross domestic product
growth of 6.0 percent this year, up from last year's 3.5 percent.
