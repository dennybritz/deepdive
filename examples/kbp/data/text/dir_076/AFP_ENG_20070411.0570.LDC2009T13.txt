Israeli warplanes nearly shot down an American airliner carrying
passengers from New York to Tel Aviv on Wednesday when the pilot
failed to respond as the plane approached the Israeli coast, an
airport authority official said.


Two Israeli F-15s and two F-16s fighter planes were scrambled to
intercept a Boeing 777 operated by the US Continental Airlines as
it prepared to enter Israeli airspace without responding to
control tower demands to identify itself, the official added.


According to Israel's private Channel-10, Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert, Defence Minister Amir Peretz and General Gaby Ashkenazy,
chief of staff, were warned that the air force was on the point
of shooting down a civilian plane suspected of being in the hands
of hijackers.


The Boeing pilot at the last minute realised the situation and
the danger threatening his craft and established contact while
still over the Mediterranean.


Escorted by the warplanes, the Boeing landed without further
problems at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport where an inquiry was
opened.
