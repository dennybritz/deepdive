Syria's National Progressive Front (NPF) coalition called on
Wednesday for voters to back its candidates at April 22
parliamentary elections which it said would be a referendum on
the policies of President Bashir al-Assad.


In a statement carried by the official SANA news agency, the
front -- a coalition of parties under the direction of the ruling
Baath party -- said: "The NPF central committee calls on citizens
to exercise their national duty in going to the polls to elect
the NPF lists and most competent representatives to the People's
Assembly (parliament)."


"The poll represents a referendum on Syrian policy led by
President Bashar al- Assad," the statement added.


Out of the 250 seats in parliament, 167 are reserved for Front
candidates, including 131 Baath party members, with 83 seats for
independents.


The election will be the second since Assad assumed power in July
2000 after the death of his father, Hafez al-Assad.


The Baath party has been in power in Syria since 1963. Since the
front coalition was created in 1973, the NPF has won all the
parliamentary polls.


Only the Baath party and its allies are recognised by Syrian law,
despite opposition calls for legal status.


Syria's opposition parties have said they will boycott the poll,
charging that "conditions are not in place for free elections".


They are demanding the abrogation of the emergency law which has
been in force since 1963, and a new law authorising other
political parties.
