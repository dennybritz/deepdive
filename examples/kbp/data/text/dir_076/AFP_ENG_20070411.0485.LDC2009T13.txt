At least 10 people were killed and around a dozen injured on
Wednesday when a bus overturned in southern Zimbabwe, state
television reported.


A police spokesman told the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation
that six people died on the spot while four others died on the
way to hospital after the accident in in the Mashonaland east
province.


Survivors said the bus was heading to the capital from the border
town of Beitbridge when it veered off the road and overturned
outside the town of Featherstone, 65 kilometers (40 miles) south
of Harare.


Other passengers said the bus, which was carrying mostly cross-
border traders, was overloaded.
