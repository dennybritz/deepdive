North Korea's parliament on Wednesday sacked the country's
premier Pak Pong-Ju and replaced him with transport minister Kim
Yong-Il, state media said.


The Supreme People's Assembly session "relieved deputy Pak Pong-
Ju of premiership and elected deputy Kim Yong-Il premier of the
cabinet of the DPRK (North Korea)," the official Korean Central
News Agency said.


The agency gave no explanation for the sacking of Pak, 67, who
had held the post since September 2003 and was theoretically the
head of government.
