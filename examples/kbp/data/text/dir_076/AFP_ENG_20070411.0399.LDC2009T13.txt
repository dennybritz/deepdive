The price of copper rallied towards 8,000 dollars per tonne on
Wednesday, striking the highest level since last September on the
back of weak global stocks and strong Chinese imports, dealers
said.


Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
(LME) rose to 7,950 dollars per tonne -- the highest reading
since September 8, 2006.


"Copper inventories generally stand below the long-term trend in
the second quarter. This is one reason for the current price
support," said Calyon metals analyst Michael Widmer.


"In addition, Chinese imports will continue to grow strongly."


Copper, used primarily in plumbing and the manufacture of
electrical cables, had hit an all-time record of 8,800 dollars
per tonne on May 11, 2006, owing largely to worries over lower
global stocks and soaring demand.
