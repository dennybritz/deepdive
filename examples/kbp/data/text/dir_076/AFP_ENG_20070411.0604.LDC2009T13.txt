A three-year-old in Gabon was killed after having been kidnapped,
raped and burnt with an iron as part of what may have been a
ritualistic ceremony, family members and others said Wednesday.


One of the suspects in the killing was attacked by an angry crowd
on Tuesday and later died from his wounds, they said. Police have
detained the other two.


The young boy, named Diamant, disappeared from his home in the
capital of Libreville on Sunday afternoon and his body was
discovered that night in a car, his grandmother said. There were
burns on his feet and back.


Police confirmed the incident, but declined to give further
details.


The head of the Gabonese Association for the Fight Against Ritual
Crimes said the murder carried the marks of a ritual, a recurring
practice in the country.


The rituals often involve kidnapping young people and mutilating
them to collect body parts to be used in ceremonies believed to
bring health, power and wealth.


Jean-Elvis Ebang Ondo, president of the association, said the
boy's fingers and tongue were collected.
