Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Wednesday shut down
a city centre cemetery that had become a refuge for criminals, in
a bid to curb a rising crime wave.


"As of today the Palm Grove cemetery is closed," said Sirleaf to
applause from scores of curious residents.


Flanked by the Minister of Public Works, Losseni Donso, Sirleaf
laid a brick on the ground to symbolise the fencing off of the
cemetery.


"As soon as they put the wall up, this graveyard is closed," she
said, adding that even burials had been forbidden.


Relatives wishing to perform rituals will have to seek clearance
from authorities to visit the site.


Local residents had complained of escalating crime since scores
of people dubbed the "living dead" had made the burial grounds
their home shortly after the 2003 war.


Mainly former combatants and wanted criminals, they had turned
the city centre cemetery into a hideout and a market for drugs
such as marijuana and cocaine.


Liberia's national police and the United Nations peacekeeping
mission in the country (UNMIL) raided the graveyard on several
occasions, arresting criminals and recovering stolen goods.


But local resident Robert Gray told AFP: "After 6:00 pm you
cannot pass near this cemetery.


"If a rogue takes anything from you and you chase him, he takes
the road to this cemetery. When he gets here, the best thing you
can do is not to follow him, otherwise you get killed," he added.


Ringing off the cemetery will cost an estimated 18,000 US dollars
in a scheme to be funded by the World Bank and the Liberian
government.
