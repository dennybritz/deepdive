Bangladesh were 85-6 after 20 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against England at the Kensington Oval here on
Wednesday.


Saqibul Hasan was on 35 with Mashrafe Mortaza on one.


England had won the toss and eleced to field and the decision
paid off as Bangladesh collapsed.


Tamim Iqbal was caught by Paul Collingwood off Sajid Mahmood for
eight with skipper Habibul Bashar run out for four to make the
score 23-2 in six overs.


Shahriar Nafees was the third man out, caught by Andrew Strauss
off Mahmood for nine in the eighth over with the score on 26.


Things got worse for Bangladesh as Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad
Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed all followed in quick succession.


England remained unchanged from their seven-wicket defeat against
Australia in Antigua on Sunday, while Bangladesh brought back
vice-captain Shahriar Nafees in place of Javed Omar from their
team which upset South Africa by 67 runs in Georgetown, Guyana
last week.
