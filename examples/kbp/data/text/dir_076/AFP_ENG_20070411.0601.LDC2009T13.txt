Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer revealed on Wednesday
that the German champions would be ready to let Owen Hargreaves
join Manchester United this summer if the price was right.


"If it is right that there is an offer of 25-30 million euros for
Hargreaves, then I would seriously consider it," Beckenbauer told
Premiere television before Bayern's Champions League quarter-
final against AC Milan.


"I think the board also think this is the way to satisfy the
needs of the player."


United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been keen to sign the
England international midfielder, even offering a reported 20
million pounds (39m dollars), but that has so far not been enough
to tempt Bayern.


They believe the 26-year-old should honour the new four-year
contract he signed last summer which takes him up until 2010.


Meanwhile, Beckenbauer said that it would be a "dream" for Bayern
to recruit an international striker of the calibre of Italian
Luca Toni (Fiorentina), Brazilians Kaka (AC Milan) or Ronaldinho
(Barcelona), Portugal's Deco or Argentine Lionel Messi.


"The stars won't come. To sign them is a dream," he said.


Beckenbauer added that the club had been given the green light by
their board to go up to 30 million euros (40m dollars) for a big-
name transfer.
