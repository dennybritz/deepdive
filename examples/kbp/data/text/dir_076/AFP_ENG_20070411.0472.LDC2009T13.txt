An Istanbul court on Wednesday charged an eleventh suspect over
the murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, Anatolia
news agency reported.


The court charged Mustafa Ozturk with being an accomplice in the
January 19 killing and aiding a criminal organisation. It
remanded him in custody pending trial.


Ozturk had been questioned by police in February and was
subsequently released by a court, but the prosecutor in charge of
the investigation appealed and secured an arrest warrant in his
name.


He was caught last month in a house raid in the eastern city of
Erzurum.


Among the 11 suspects is the alleged assailant, a 17-year-old
jobless secondary school graduate who officials say has confessed
to gunning down Dink, 52, outside the offices of his Turkish-
Armenian weekly Agos in Istanbul.


Prosecutors have yet to complete their indictment on Dink's
murder.


Dink was branded a traitor by nationalists for urging open debate
on the World War I massacres of Armenians under the Ottoman
Empire, which he labelled as genocide, a label that Ankara
fiercely rejects.


He was given a suspended six-month sentence last year for
"insulting Turkishness" under a penal code article that has been
used to prosecute a number of intellectuals and raised alarms
about freedom of speech in Turkey.
