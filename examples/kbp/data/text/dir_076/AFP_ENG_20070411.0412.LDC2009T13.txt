General Motors could slash thousands more jobs at its German unit
Opel, on top of drastic restructuring measures three years ago,
the fortnightly magazine Capital reported in article released on
Wednesday.


GM is set to hold talks with employee representatives of its
three different European subsidiaries, Saab, Vauxhall and Opel,
on April 17 over ways of cutting costs.


GM management estimates that overcapacity at the factories that
make its Astra cars could rise to 280,000 units by 2010 compared
with 88,000 at present, the magazine said.


In a separate report to be published in the Thurday edition of
the business daily Handelsblatt, the head of Opel's general works
council Klaus Franz put the figure at 230,000 units.


In order to rectify the situation, GM calculated it would need to
cut costs by 450 million euros over the next two years, Capital
said.
