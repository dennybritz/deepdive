Columbia University, one of the top US schools, said Wednesday it
had received one of the largest ever donations to a US university
-- a 400 million dollar pledge from a billionaire former student.


Ninety-two year old John Kluge, a German immigrant who graduated
from the top flight Ivy League school 70 years ago and went on to
make his fortune in television, has previously given more than
100 million dollars to Columbia.


His latest gift is designated for financial aid for students and
was the fourth largest ever gift to a US university, which
traditionally rely on former students to maintain their
endowments, Columbia said in a statement.


"John's extraordinary gift, coupled with his earlier gifts, will
help generations of Columbians," Columbia's president, Lee
Bollinger, said in the statement, welcoming the gift.
