Bombs and shootings killed 22 people and wounded dozens on
Saturday as Iraq's relentless insurgency and sectarian violence
continued, security officials said.


The deadliest attack was in northern Iraq, when a minibus taking
workers home after their day's work at a local Iraqi army base
drove straight into an ambush in a village south of the Kirkuk
oil hub.


Eight workers were killed and one wounded when insurgents stopped
the bus at the village of Safra and sprayed bullets into the
vehicle, police Captain Abdallah Talab said from the nearby town
of Hawija.


In Baghdad, five people were killed and 15 wounded when a car
bomb exploded outside Al-Sadr hospital in Baghdad's Shiite
enclave of Sadr City, a favourite target of Sunni extremists in
the ongoing sectarian conflict with Shiites.


A second car bomb killed four people, including two policemen,
and wounded 20 more, many of them police officers, near a petrol
station in the central Shiite city of Hilla.


They were guarding the fuel station when the bomb exploded, also
destroying 10 cars waiting to fill up, police said.


In the largely Shiite town of Suweira, south of Baghdad, three
civilians were killed and seven wounded by a roadside bomb as
shoppers were doing their weekend shopping, police said.


Back in the Kirkuk area, two civilians were killed and 11 wounded
when a car bomb exploded in a central square in the town of Tuz
Khurmatu, local police chief Abbas Mohammed Amin said.


Insurgents have carried out major attacks across Iraq this week,
killing hundreds of people.
