Sweden's Alex Noren produced a third round 68 for a six-under par
total of 207 to take the lead in the Portugal Open here on
Saturday.


Last year's English amateur champion Ross McGowan, the overnight
leader, is lying in second spot, a shot behind after a 72, with
Spanish amateur Pablo Martina a further shot adrift in a tie for
third.


Martin produced a stunning back nine of 29 for a 66 to catapult
from 23rd at the midway stage to give himself a very real chance
of becoming the first amateur to win on the European Tour.


The last time he was in such a challenging position was when he
led the Spanish Open three years ago with 17 holes to go, only to
slump out of contention with a final round 74.


"I think I have matured a little bit since then. I was at school
then and brought my books with me," the 29-year-old who plans to
turn professional this summer reflected of that missed
opportunity.


If he succeeds he will emulate Dr David Sheehan of Ireland who
was the last amateur to win a professional event in Europe, the
1962 Jeyes Tournament at Royal Dublin, but that was before the
European Tour was created.
