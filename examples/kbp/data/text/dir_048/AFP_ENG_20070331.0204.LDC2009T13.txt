The agent of Czech Republic captain Tomas Rosicky has hit out at
criticism of the Arsenal player's role in the midweek party
scandal following Euro 2008 qualifying action.


Rosicky, together with Jan Polak, Martin Jiranek and substitute
keeper, Marek Cech, were photographed at celebrations in defender
Tomas Ujfalusy's room by popular daily SIP. Prostitutes were also
brought in for the occasion, it said.


Rosicky has born the brunt of criticism, which mounted after a
lucklustre 1-0 home win against minnows Cyprus on Wednesday.


National football bosses fined the whole team one million koruna
(35,750 euros) but refused to give details of the bad behavior
being punished and who exactly took part.


"According to my verified information, the whole team were
partying there when the journalist knocked on the hotel room
door, with the exception of three players who I won't name now,"
Paska told Saturday's edition of the daily, Sport.


"Inside was not just the captain, Rosicky, who had to be at the
party because the team is a team, but also both of his deputies,
Ujfalusy and (Petr) Cech," Paska added. Ujfalusy was celebrating
his 29th birthday.


The world renknowned Chelsea goalkeeper has until now emerged
with his reputation relatively unscathed by the criticism of
Czech players for their performances on and off the field.
