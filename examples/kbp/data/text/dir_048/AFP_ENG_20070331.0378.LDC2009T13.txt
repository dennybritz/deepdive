Australia were 68-0 after 10 overs in their rain-restricted World
Cup Super Eights match against Bangladesh at the Sir Vivian
Richards Stadium here Saturday chasing 105 to win.


A wet outfield delayed the start by five hours and meant the
match was reduced to a 22 overs per side contest.


Adam Gilchrist was on 40 with Matthew Hayden on 28.


Earlier, Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath created history when
took 3-16 to pass Pakistan great Wasim Akram's World Cup record
of 55 wickets.


McGrath now has 57 wickets to his name in 33 matches.
