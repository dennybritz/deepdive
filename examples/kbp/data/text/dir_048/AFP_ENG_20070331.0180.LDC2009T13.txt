British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett accused Iran on
Saturday of "sabre- rattling" over its capture of 15 British
naval personnel in the Gulf last week.


Beckett told reporters, following an EU foreign ministers'
meeting in Germany, that Britain had replied by diplomatic note
to Iran over the issue.


Iranian authorities have begun legal proceedings against
Britain's seized naval personnel and they will be punished if
found guilty, Iran's ambassador to Moscow said in comments
distributed earlier Saturday.


"It's not the first person to make sabre-rattling comments," said
Beckett.


"I don't think it's helpful," she added.


A diplomatic note from Iran to British authorities released
Friday condemned the "illegal act" by British naval staff in the
Gulf but did not call for an apology.


Beckett said: "I think everyone regrets that this position has
arisen. What we want is a way out of it, we want it peacefully
and we want it as soon as possible.


"We would like to be told where our personnel are, we would like
to be given access to them, but we want it resolved," Beckett
added.


She said however she feared that the current holiday period in
Iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings.


Iran has so far refused to bow to mounting international pressure
to release the naval personnel, who are being held in a secret
location and are occasionally shown on television allegedly
confessing to having entered Iranian waters.


Britain insists they were in Iraqi waters when they were seized.
