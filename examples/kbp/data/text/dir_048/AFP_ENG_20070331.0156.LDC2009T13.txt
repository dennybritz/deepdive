A suspect in an alleged failed attempt to bomb German trains last
summer had photos and videos of Osama bin Laden on his computer,
Der Spiegel magazine reports in its issue due out Monday.


German police found the materials on a computer that suspect
Yusef Mohammed al- Hajj Dib had used temporarily, the magazine
said.


Dib is currently being held in a Berlin prison.


The materials stored on the computer's hard drive include a
video, "The Prince of Killers," which depicts a decapitation
scene. In the video, bin Laden and his former lieutenant in Iraq,
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, killed in June, call for holy war.


Dib and another man, Jihad Hamad, both Lebanese, are accused of
attempting to attack two German regional trains in Koblenz and
Dortmund in July 2006. They are believed to have placed suitcases
holding homemade bombs on the trains as they passed through
Cologne station.


Authorities say explosives in their suitcases were supposed to
detonate at the same time, but they malfunctioned and there were
no blasts.


Hamad is in prison in Lebanon along with three others suspected
of preparing the failed attacks.


Hamad said in a German television interview last November that
caricatures of the prophet Mohammed reproduced in German
newspapers last summer led them to plan the attack.


Earlier this month, a newspaper reported that bomb-building
instructions had been found on a deleted hard disk of a computer
belonging to Hamad.
