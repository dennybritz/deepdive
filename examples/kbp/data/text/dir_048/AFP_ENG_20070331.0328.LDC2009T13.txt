South African novelist and Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer, whose
work addresses the struggle against apartheid, received France's
Legion of Honour Saturday at a ceremony in her home country.


"By making you an officer of the Legion of Honour, we also wish
to pay tribute to a symbolic figure of the fight against
apartheid," said French ambassador in South Africa Denis Pietton.


"Your work, deeply marked by the situation in South Africa,
remains universal," Pietton said.


The ceremony took place at the French embassy in Pretoria.


Born in the mining town of Springs in 1923, Gordimer has lived in
South Africa all her life, unlike other writers who fled the
country under apartheid.


Three of her novels were banned by the apartheid regime, which
ended with the election of Nelson Mandela as president in 1994.


She published her first novel, Come Again Tomorrow, when she was
15. Her later work describes the complexities of post-apartheid
South Africa.


Gordimer was awarded the Nobel prize in literature in 1991. She
has written 15 novels and more than 200 short stories.


In October 2006, she was the victim of an armed burglary in her
house in Johannesburg. Addressing the country's high crime rate,
she said all solutions must involve education, training and
employment.
