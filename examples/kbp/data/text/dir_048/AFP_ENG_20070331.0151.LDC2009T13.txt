Nude photos of Thai celebrities to be auctioned to raise money
for AIDS patients have drawn criticism from the army-backed
government and conservative activists, reports said Saturday.


The auction, organized by Thai fashion magazine Fame, aimed to
raise money for a financially struggling Buddhist temple that
cares for abandoned AIDS patients, English-language newspapers
the Nation and Bangkok Post said.


Prisana Pongtatsirikul, secretary-general of the Office of the
National Cultural Commission, said posing naked was not something
"decent women" did.


"I would like them to cover themselves. Being naked is not
beautiful, nor is it a practice of decent women," Prisana told
the Bangkok Post.


Conservative activists also accused the naked models of setting a
bad example for the country's youth.


Model and actor Penpak Sirikul, one of 32 celebrities who posed
for the auction, defended her actions.


"People are born naked," she was quoted by the Nation as saying.


"This is the art of women's beauty. We did it for free," she
said.


The nude photos will be shown in a Bangkok exhibition from April
5-9, but the papers said the temple has already told organisers
it would refuse any money from the upcoming auction.


Neither the temple nor the organizer could be reached for
comment. An official from the cultural commission was not
available either.


While Thailand is known for its anything-goes sex industry, the
mainly Buddhist country remains shy about sexuality.


In February, a revealing black dress worn by a minor Thai actress
sparked a moral outrage, forcing the young woman to publicly
apologize for her apparent lapse in judgement.
