Yumari Gonzalez handed Cuba their second medal of the world track
cycling championships on Saturday when she won the women's 10km
scratch race.


Gonzalez escaped from the bunch early in the last lap of the
40-lap race to finish well ahead of Colombia's Maria Calle
Williams and American Rebecca Quinn.


Quinn was later relegated by the race jury because of an
infringement, meaning fourth-placed Dutchwoman Adrie Visser took
the bronze medal.


Cuban Lisandra Guerra won silver in the women's 500 metre time
trial, won by Australian Anna Meares' in a new world record time
of 33.588.
