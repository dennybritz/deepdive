Anna Meares of Australia won the women's 500 metre time trial
crown in a new world record setting time here at the track
cycling world championships on Saturday.


Meares blitzed a new world mark of 33.58sec for the two-lap event
to reclaim the title she last won in 2004.


The Australian, who is also the Olympic champion in the event,
finished ahead of Cuban Lisandra Guerra, who came close to
Meares' old world record of 33.944 when she stopped the clock at
34.015.


Defending champion Natallia Tsylinskaya of Russia, who was last
to start from the 21-strong field, took the bronze in a time of
34.430.


Meares' win means Australia have won their first gold medal of
the championships.
