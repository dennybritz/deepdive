A team of British police officers is to fly to Jamaica next week
to help with the probe into the death of Pakistan cricket coach
Bob Woolmer, London's Metropolitan Police said Saturday.


The team will consist of three detectives and a scenes of crime
officer, a spokeswoman for the force said.


"We received a formal request from the Jamaican authorities to
review the investigation," she told AFP.


She could not confirm precisely when they would arrive or give
further details of what their work would likely entail.


In a statement, the Met said that it was "normal practice" for a
review to take place shortly after the start of an investigation
and stressed that the Jamaican Constabulary Force would remain
"the primary investigating force".


The team will be led by a detective superintendent from the
homicide and serious crime command, the statement added.


Woolmer's body was found nearly two weeks ago at the Pegasus
Hotel in Kingston.


The murder of the 58-year-old, which came the day after Pakistan
was  knocked out of the World Cup by Ireland, has prompted
speculation of links to illegal betting syndicates.


But police have said there is no evidence to suggest bookmakers
were responsible.
