US President George W. Bush on Saturday said that Iran's seizure
of 15 British sailors and marines was "inexcusable behavior" and
he supported British efforts to get them back.


"It's a serious issue because the Iranians took these people out
of Iraqi water. And it's inexcusable behavior and I strongly
support the (British Prime Minister Tony) Blair government's
attempts to resolve this peacefully," Bush said.
