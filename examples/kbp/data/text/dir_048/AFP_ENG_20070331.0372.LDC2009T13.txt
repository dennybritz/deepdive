US President George W. Bush on Saturday reiterated his support
for embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales who is under fire
for his alleged role in the dismissal of eight US prosecutors.


Gonzales is an "honorable and honest man. He has my full
confidence," Bush told a news conference at his Camp David,
Maryland retreat.
