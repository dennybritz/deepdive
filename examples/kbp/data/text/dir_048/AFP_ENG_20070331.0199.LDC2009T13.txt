Celtic continued to stagger rather than stroll towards the
Scottish Premier League finishing line when they were held to a
1-1 draw by ten-man Dundee United here on Satuday.


Jon Daly's late equaliser cancelled out another free-kick special
delivery from Shunsuke Nakamura as the champions failed to win
for the fourth game in a row.


Nakamura's 25-yard strike - after Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink had
been brought down - had given the below-par champions the lead
shortly after the interval and Gordon Strachan's side looked
certain to return to winning ways when United captain Barry
Robson was sent off in the 89th minute for head-butting left-back
Lee Naylor in an off-the-ball clash.


But two minutes into injury time, Daly chested down a long-ball
towards the Celtic penalty box and beat Artur Boruc with a superb
half-volley from the edge of the box to snatch a share of the
points for the home side.


Following defeats by Rangers and Falkirk, Celtic have now taken
just one point from a possible nine in their last three league
outings, as well as going out of the Champions League to AC
Milan.


But Gordon Strachan's side remain virtually assured of retaining
the SPL title thanks to the huge cushion they built up in the
first half of the season.


Saturday's point left Celtic 14 points clear of second-placed
Rangers, who were entertaining Inverness Caledonian Thistle later
on Saturday.
