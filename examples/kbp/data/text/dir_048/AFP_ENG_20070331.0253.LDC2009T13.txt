Umpire Billy Bowden said he was "postive we'll get a game today"
as the start of the World Cup Super Eights match between
Australia and Bangladesh continued to be delayed here Saturday.


The match didn't start as scheduled at 9.30am local time
(1330GMT) because of a wet outfield caused by heavy rain in
Antigua during the last 24 hours. Several wet patches had formed
near the edge of the boundary, making conditions potentially
dangerous for fieldsmen.


But following the breakdown of one of the main 'super-soppers',
groundstaff were reduced to treading in affected areas with
pieces of foam while Bowden and Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar made
regular inspections.


As the sun started to come out, and with the pitch uncovered,
frustrated spectators began a slow handicap at 12.15pm local time
when the match had still not got underway.


The latest play can start Saturday is 2.47pm local time. That
will enable enough time for a 20 overs per side contest to be
completed Saturday, subject to any further weather delays.


A 20 overs per side fixture is the minimum length required under
tournament rules to consititute a match.


All fixtures at the World Cup have a reserve day in case of bad
weather.


Reigning champions Australia, bidding to become the first side to
win three successive World Cups after their 1999 and 2003
triumphs, won their opening second round match against hosts West
Indies by 103 runs here on Wednesday.


This match was Bangladesh's first in the Super Eights.
