US Harvard University student Thomas Snyder become world sudoku
champion in Prague on Saturday when he beat Japan's Yuhei Kusui
in the head to head final round.


Snyder, 27, who was runner up in the first world championships of
the popular numerical logic game last year, scored 162 against
Kusei's 135 points in the final session of the three day event in
which 141 of the world's best players took part.


"I was really disappointed not to have won last year," Snyder,
who is also the reigning US world puzzle champion, said.


Snyder, a chemistry student who expected to graduate this year,
said the secret of his success was playing "lots of logic
puzzles, not just sudoku." "I started doing mathematical and
logic puzzles when I was four or five at the time between
crawling and walking," he added.


Japan won the world team competition, which was held for the
first time this year,  with 4,490 points. The United States took
second place with 4,328 points, followed by the Czech Republic on
3,690 points.


Sudoku, a sort of numerical crossword where contestants have to
fill a nine by nine grid so that each column, each row, and each
of the nine three by three internal squares contains only the
numbers from one to nine, was revived at the end of the 1980's
and has recently enjoyed a worldwide boom in popularity.
