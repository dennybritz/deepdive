Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva arrived Saturday for
talks with President George W. Bush expected to cover global
trade at the US leader's Camp David mountain retreat.


The two are expected to focus on moving forward the fraught Doha
round of world trade talks. These aim to lower global trade
barriers but have repeatedly stalled, largely due to disagreement
over trade tariffs and farm subsidies.


The United States and Brazil, the economic giant of South
America, are two of the main players in the so-called Doha round.


Bush and Lula are also expected on Saturday to discuss boosting
trade between their countries and possible cooperation on
promoting clean bio-fuels and ethanol, a plant-based fuel which
can serve as a replacement for gasoline. The two countries are
leading ethanol producers.


It is the first such reception of a South American leader at Camp
David in more than 15 years but the seventh time Bush has met
with Lula since the Brazilian was elected in 2002. The two also
met in Sao Paolo three weeks ago.


They may also discuss the situation in the impoverished Caribbean
state of Haiti, where Brazil is leading a peacekeeping force
following political violence.


Lula's visit reflects a continued desire by Bush to reach out to
Latin America, where left-wing leaders such as Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez have led a surge of anti-American feeling.


Bush made a five-country tour of the region in early March.
