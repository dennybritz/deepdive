Nine Zimbabwean opposition officials arrested during a midweek
crackdown were hospitalised Saturday for injuries suffered in
police custody, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said.


"They were brutalised, one of them was in rescuscitation, they
are in a bad shape but in high spirit," Tsvangirai said after
visiting them in hospital.


"Many of them suffered bruises around the abdomen," the leader of
the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) told AFP in an
interview.


Scores of MDC officials and supporters were arrested this week in
what police said was a clampdown on fire bombers accused of a
series of attacks across the southern African country.


The MDC has denied the accusations saying its members, charged
with attempted murder over the firebombing of a ruling ZANU-PF
office this week, were framed.


"We don't sanction or plan any bombings, we don't support
violence," Tsvangirai told a news conference earlier Saturday.


The officials, among them a lawmaker, were taken to hospital
after one of them allegedly collapsed while awaiting a hearing on
their application for bail at a magistrate court on Saturday.


Veteran President Robert Muagbe has in recent days come in for
wide condemnation by the West for the arrests and assaults of
senior members of the opposition as they tried to stage an anti-
government rally on March 11.


But addressing supporters in his native Shona language Friday
before his party meeting that endorsed his candidature for 2008
elections, Mugabe was unapologetic about a police assault on
Tsvangirai, saying he deserved it.
