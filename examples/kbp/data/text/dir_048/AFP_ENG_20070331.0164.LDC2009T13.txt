Two more children from impoverished southern Egypt have been
infected with the deadly avian flu virus, raising to 31 the
number of cases reported, the health ministry said on Saturday.


Ibrahim Mahmud Helmi, four, from Qena province and Mahmud
Mohammed Shalabi from Sohag, both poor provinces in the Nile
valley, were diagnosed with the flu and transferred to Cairo for
treatment with the Tamiflu drug.


Their cases come hard on the heels of reports of two other
children stricken on Tuesday, making for at least half a dozen
infections of children in the south by the H5N1 virus in March.


Women and children have borne the brunt of the virus due to their
role in taking care of domestic fowl. Egypt is the hardest hit by
the virus outside Asia.


The government says it is conducting a vigorous campaign to
combat the spread of the virus through vaccinations and raising
awareness, but cases continue to appear. So far 13 people have
succumbed to the virus.
