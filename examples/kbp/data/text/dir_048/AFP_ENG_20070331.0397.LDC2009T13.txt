US President George W. Bush on Saturday reiterated his support
for embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under fire for
his alleged role in the dismissal of eight US prosecutors.


Gonzales is an "honorable and honest man. He has my full
confidence," Bush told a news conference at his Camp David,
Maryland retreat.


"There is no credible evidence that there has been any
wrongdoing," Bush added.


Democrats in Congress have pressed for Gonzales's resignation
after evidence from e-mails and a top former aide implicated the
long-time Bush ally in the sacking late last year of eight US
attorneys for what Democrats claim were political reasons.


The Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating why the US
attorneys were fired, even as several of them were in the middle
of sensitive corruption investigations, and to what extent
Gonzales and the White House were involved in their removal.


Gonzales has denied being deeply involved in the matter.


But last Thursday his former chief of staff Kyle Sampson told the
committee that Gonzales, who leads the Department of Justice, was
involved.


"I and others made staff recommendations but they were approved
and signed off on by the principals," Sampson said.


Sampson resigned nearly three weeks ago after the Justice
Department released e-mail records that showed him in close
contact with senior White House officials over the sackings.
