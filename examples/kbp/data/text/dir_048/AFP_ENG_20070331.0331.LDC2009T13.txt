The Iranian foreign ministry said on Saturday that a British
diplomatic note it had received over the seizure of 15 sailors
"could be examined," but that Tehran awaits a "balanced" attitude
from London.


"In this note there are different points which could be
examined," the foreign ministry said in a statement about a note
it had received from London in response to its formal protest
over the sailors' alleged illegal entry into Iran's territorial
waters.


"We are awaiting a correction of attitude on Britain's part and
adopting a balanced and transparent attitude within the framework
of Iran's legitimate demands," the statement said.


The foreign ministry also defended the airing on Iranian
television of video footage showing "confessions" by two of the
captured Britons for trespassing into Iranian waters and
apologising.


"Showing videos of detainees took place in line with humanitarian
considerations in order to alleviate their families' concerns and
to show they are fine," it said.
