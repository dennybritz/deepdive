Australia captain Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to field
against Bangladesh in their World Cup Super Eights match at the
Sir Vivian Richards Stadium here Saturday.


A wet outfield delayed the start by five hours and meant this
match was reduced to a 22 overs per side contest.


Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath, just one wicket away from
drawing level with Pakistan great Wasim Akram's World Cup record
of 52, now had a maximum of five overs in which to equal the mark
in this match.


World champions Australia were unchanged from the team that beat
West Indies by 103 runs in their Super Eight opener here
Wednesday.


Bangladesh, in what was their first match of the second round,
brought in Tapash Baisya for fellow pace bowler Syed Rasal in the
only change to the team that defeated Bermuda by seven wickets to
secure their Super Eight spot on Sunday at the Queen's Park Oval
in Port-of-Spain.
