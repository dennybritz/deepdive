Reigning champions CSKA Moscow went top of the Russian league

Saturday.


CSKA have seven points from three matches and moved equal on
points with nine- time champions Spartak and FC Moscow. Samara
and Perm share third place after Saturday's round of matches with
five points apiece.


Brazilian midfielder Ramon put the army men into the lead in the
first minute of the game, while his compatriot striker Vagner
Love doubled the advantage with just seven minutes to go.


Meanwhile, 10-man Spartak clinched a vital 3-1 away win at Saint
Petersburg.


Spartak skipper Yegor Titov lifted his side 1-0 up when the game
was just two minutes old, sending the ball home from the edge of
the penalty box.


Spartak's Austrian full back Martin Stranzl addded the second in
the 24th minute with an eight-yard header from a corner.


Midfielder Vadimir Bystrov made it 3-0 for Spartak eight minutes
before the break from the penalty spot after Ukraine
international full-back Anatoly Timoshchuk fouled him in the box.


Spartak midfielder Alexei Rebko was sent off five minutes before
the break for a second bookable offence. Saint Petersburg striker
Pavel Pogrebnyak reduced the arears with five minutes to go but
that was not enough to save the day.
