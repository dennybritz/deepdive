Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos on Saturday
defended his upcoming visit to Cuba calling it necessary at an
important time in the island's future.


The visit on Monday and Tuesday has been criticised by the
Spanish conservative opposition but Moratinos said it was
"necessary at an important moment for the island's future and the
future of relations between Cuba and Spain".


The first visit by a Spanish foreign minister to Cuba since 1998
reflects the desire for a real dialogue to the Communist island,
he said on the sidelines of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in
Bremen, Germany.


Spain's policy on Cuba has shifted since Prime Minister Jose Luis
Zapatero, a socialist, came to power in 2004, after his
conservative predecessor Jose Maria Aznar adopted a policy of
isolating the Communist island.


"Spain can't be absent from Cuba," said Moratinos.


He added that there was no planned meeting with 80-year-old Cuban
leader Fidel Castro, who has been in bad health and has handed
the running of the country to his brother Raul.
