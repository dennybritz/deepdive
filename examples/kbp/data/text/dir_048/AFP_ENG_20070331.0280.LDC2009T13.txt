Between 7,000 and 15,000 young people demonstrated on the streets
of Copenhagen on Saturday for the first time since riots at the
beginning of March against the closure of a youth centre.


The marchers were demonstrating to defend the city's hippy
enclave of Christiania and for the creation of a new premises for
the city's youth and alternative scene to replace the demolished
Ungdomshuset.


The demonstrators, chanting, waving black and red flags and
carrying banners, marched past parliament to the sound of hip hop
music.


The forced eviction on March 1 of squatters running the
Ungdomshuset centre sparked several nights of violent protests in
the Danish capital. Around 700 people were arrested in the week
following its closure.


The "Free City" of Christiania was created in September 1971 by a
group of hippies on the site of an old army barracks and has
enjoyed a measure of autonomy in its 35-year history.


But the area is under threat from plans by the centre-right
government of Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen to be brought
back into the fold or face being dismantled.
