Siena eased their relegation fears with a precious 1-0 win at
fellow Serie A strugglers Reggina on Saturday.


A headed goal by Valerio Bertotto in first half stoppage-time was
enough to seal the points for the visitors.


Both sides had a player sent off. Reggina defender Alessandro
Lucarelli saw red in the 22nd minute before Siena's Daniele
Corvio joined him for an early bath midway through the second
half.


The professional foul on Francesco Cozza, which earned Lucarelli
his marching orders, resulted in a penalty for Siena, but Cozza's
spot-kick was saved by Andrea Campagnolo.


Siena's win left them in 13th place in the 20-team division on 30
points, five ahead of Reggina and six clear of the relegation
zone.


In Saturday's late match Roma, who are 18 points behind leaders
Inter Milan in second place, host fifth-placed AC Milan at the
Olympic stadium.
