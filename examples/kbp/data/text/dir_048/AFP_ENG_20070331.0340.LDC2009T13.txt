Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath beat Wasim Akram's record of
55 World Cup wickets here on Saturday.


McGrath pulled level with the great Pakistan left-armer when he
clean-bowled Shahriar Nafees in the Super Eights match against
Bangladesh.


He then took his 56th to set the new mark when he forced Aftab
Ahmed to serve up a catch to Nathan Bracken in the sixth over of
the match which had been restricted to 22 overs a side due to
rain at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.
