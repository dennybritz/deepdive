Japanese Olympic team striker Robert Cullen kept Jubilo Iwata in
touch with the J-League leaders on Saturday with the only goal in
a 1-0 win over JEF United Chiba.


Cullen struck his first of the season in the sixth minute,
scoring from 10 yards after a pass from Yoshiaki Ota. The former
champions then held out against heavy pressure to record an
important win.


The former champions' third win left them three points behind
leaders Gamba Osaka and one adrift of second-placed Kashiwa
Reysol. Iwata are level on nine points with Nagoya Grampus Eight
and Shimizu S-Pulse.


Another ex-champion team, Kashima Antlers, were left searching
for their first win after a 1-1 draw with Vissel Kobe.


Former Real Mallorca striker Yoshito Okubo put Kobe ahead in
first-half injury- time only for Brazilian defender Fabao to
equalise with a 35-yard free-kick a minute later.


Osaka came back from a goal down to beat Ventforet Kofu 2-1,
while Kashiwa Reysol blanked FC Tokyo 2-0. Nagoya will play
Yokohama FC on Sunday.


Shimizu S-Pulse downed Omiya Ardija 2-1, Yokohama Marinos
defeated Sanfrecce Hiroshima 3-1, and Albirex Niigata beat
Kawasaki Frontale 2-0.
