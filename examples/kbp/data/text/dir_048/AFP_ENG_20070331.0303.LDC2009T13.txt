President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Saturday again called for
Britain to apologise after 15 British sailors were seized by Iran
in the Gulf, the state news agency IRNA reported.


"The arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the
Iranian people, instead of apologising and expressing regret over
the British sailors entering Iranian waters," he said.


"Unfortunately arrogant powers today blatantly violate laws...
that they have crafted themselves," Ahmadinejad said.


Iran has defied international calls to release the 15 British
navy personnel it seized on March 23 for alleged illegal entry
into its territorial waters.


Britain insists they were operating in Iraqi waters.
