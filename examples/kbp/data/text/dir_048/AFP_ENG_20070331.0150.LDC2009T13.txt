A woman was shot dead in front of other passengers at an airport
in this southern German city on Saturday as she was checking in
for a flight, a police spokesman said.


Police said a 31-year-old suspect arrested in a car park of the
airport shortly after the shooting was apparently the woman's ex-
husband.


The 25-year-old woman was shot in the head several times as she
was preparing to check in her bags for a flight to Pristina,
capital of the breakaway Serbian province of Kosovo.


A police spokesman said another man was slightly wounded in the
thigh by a stray bullet.


The shooting at about 6:00 am (0400 GMT) caused panic among
airport staff and passengers, who included families with
children, the spokesman said. Some flung themselves to the ground
on hearing the shots.


The scene of the crime was sealed off and passengers were
directed to another part of the airport, which is the 10th
biggest in Germany.
