At least 40 people were killed on Saturday in Sudan's south
Darfur region in an attack a rebel group blamed on the
government-backed Janjaweed militia.


"I have the names of 43 members of the Arab Torjam tribe who were
killed on Saturday in an attack by the Border Guards (also known
as the Janjaweed) in the area west of Nyala," the provincial
capital, rebel chief Ibrahim Ahmed Ibrahim told AFP from London
by telephone.


A member of the Torjam tribe in Nyala, reached by telephone,
confirmed the attack, but gave the toll as 53 dead.


Sudan's western Darfur region has been wracked by civil war for
the past four years in which 200,000 people have been killed and
2.5 million displaced, according to UN estimates. Some sources
say the death toll is much higher.
