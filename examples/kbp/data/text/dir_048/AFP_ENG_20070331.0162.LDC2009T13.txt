South Sydney's National Rugby League resurgence continued apace
Saturday with a 26-16 away victory over Cronulla for the
Rabbitohs' best start to a season in 35 years.


Winger Nathan Merritt scored a try double as Souths capitalised
on a near- perfect first half to claim their third straight win
to begin 2007.


It is the first time since 1972 the Bunnies have opened with
three straight victories, with the 2006 wooden spooners now near
the top of the table midway through the third round.


Souths raced to a 16-0 lead after 19 minutes, and took a 20-4
advantage into the break, before keeping the Cronulla Sharks at
bay in the second half.


Merritt and fullback David Peachey, both former Sharks, provided
the excitement for Souths in the opening half, with Merritt's
80-metre solo effort - his second try - one of the highlights.


North Queensland scrum-half Johnathan Thurston showed why he is
regarded as the hottest player in the NRL after a starring
performance in the Cowboys'  22-18 win over St George Illawarra
in Wollongong.


Thurston pulled the strings in all four of the Cowboys' tries,
but the Australian Test scrum-half almost cost his side victory
when the Dragons made a late rally while he was in the sin bin.


The Cowboys led 22-0 when Thurston was sin-binned in the 63rd
minute for a professional foul and it sparked the Dragons into
action but they fell four points short at the end.
