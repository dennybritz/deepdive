France captain Fabien Pelous kicked his first ball in anger since
an ankle injury almost four months ago when turning out for his
club Toulouse's second team on Saturday.


Pelous suffered a problem to his left ankle in mid-December in a
European Cup match against Welsh side Llanelli which forced him
out of France's Six Nations campaign.


After the run out the 33-year-old lock, who is only one
appearance away from Philippe Sella's French record of 111
international caps, said: "I was a little concerned that the pain
might flare up again, but that didn't happen.


"I can't say yet when I'll be back for the first team as it's not
me but my body which will decide that."


Frederic Michalak, who himself returned from a four month spell
on the sidelines a fortnight ago, was also in action in the game
against Tarbes.
