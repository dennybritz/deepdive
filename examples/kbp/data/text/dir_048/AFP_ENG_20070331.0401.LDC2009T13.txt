Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath beat Wasim Akram's record of
55 World Cup wickets here on Saturday.


McGrath pulled level with the great Pakistan left-armer when he
clean-bowled Shahriar Nafees in the Super Eights match against
Bangladesh.


He then took his 56th to set the new mark when he forced Aftab
Ahmed to serve up a catch to Nathan Bracken in the sixth over of
the match which had been restricted to 22 overs a side due to
rain at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.


The 37-year-old then went to 57 when he had Mohammad Ashraful
caught by captain Ricky Ponting as the veteran paceman finished
with 3-16 to help set up what proved to be an easy 10-wicket win.


"Wasim Akram was one of the best bowlers of all time so to go
past him is something pretty special," said McGrath who was given
the new ball by Ponting after the skipper had won the toss and
put the opposition into bat.


"Bangladesh had to come out and score quick runs so I tried to
mix it up and get a few in the right area and they all came out
pretty well."
