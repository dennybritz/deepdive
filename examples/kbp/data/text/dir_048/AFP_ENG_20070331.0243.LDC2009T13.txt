Iraq's embattled government on Saturday issued an impassioned
plea to reverse the brain drain sapping qualified professionals
from what was once the most educated country in the Middle East.


It came after Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki held talks with the
visiting high commissioner of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR)
Antonio Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister, on the tens
of thousands of displaced Iraqis.


"The government is continuing its efforts to ensure circumstances
conducive for our people to come back to our country, especially
qualified people," the coalition cabinet said in a statement.


"The government is serious about drawing up a plan in order to
encourage the intelligentsia who have left, especially medics and
engineers, to come back," the statement added.


Last week, the UNHCR said that the number of Iraqis fleeing to
industralised countries had surged by 77 percent in the space of
a year, countering the global trend of a decline in asylum
seekers.


Iraqis are today the largest single national group of asylum
seekers, desperate to flee the sectarian violence and surge of
fundamentalist Islam that has hit the educated and largely
secular middle class in particular.


An estimated 1.9 million Iraqis are displaced inside the country
and some two million are outside their strife-torn homeland --
mainly in Syria and Jordan.
