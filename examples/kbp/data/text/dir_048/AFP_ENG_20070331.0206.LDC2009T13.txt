A New York gallery has cancelled an exhibition of a life-size
sculpture of a naked Jesus Christ cast in chocolate after it
sparked an uproar among American Roman Catholics.


Staff at the swanky Roger Smith Hotel in midtown Manhattan said
Saturday it had called off the controversial exhibit, which was
due to open next week just before traditional Easter
celebrations, but did not explain its decision.


Bill Donohue of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights, which had led objections to the anatomically revealing
sculpture and described it as a "direct in-your-face assault on
Christians," welcomed the hotel's decision.


However, he criticised the way the hotel had handled the episode
and particularly the reported comments by its creative director,
Matt Semler.


"For him to say that our objection to this outrageous display
constitutes hate speech and is the equivalent of a fatwa shows
how deliriously irresponsible this man is," Donohue said in a
statement.


Semler was not immediately available to comment on the furor.


The work, titled "My Sweet Lord" and made of 90 kilos (200
pounds) of chocolate, featured a crucified Jesus suspended from
the ceiling.


The artist, Cosimo Cavallaro, whose other projects have included
covering a house in five tons of cheese and setting fire to a
grand piano, was also not immediately reachable.
