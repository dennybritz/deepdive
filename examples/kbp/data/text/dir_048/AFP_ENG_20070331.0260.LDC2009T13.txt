Former Spanish international Juan Carlos Valeron will not know
for six months whether his career has come to an end, said a
surgeon who operated on his damaged left knee here on Saturday.


The 31-year-old midfielder, who has made 45 appearances for his
country, has had three injuries to the joint since the start of
2006 and has only played in two games during that time.


"It will be six months before we know for sure whether he can
return to play and if that happens it will be in about a year,"
said doctor Rafael Arriaza, who was one of four surgeons who
worked for two-and-a-half hours on Valeron.


"However, everybody is happy with the situation, and although we
had to work hard there there is a reasonable possibility Juan
Carlos will be able to play again," added Arriaza.


Valeron first got injured in January 2006, with a recurrence in
July last year during a pre-season match.


He returned to action on January 7 when Deportivo beat Real
Madrid 2-0 but got injured again in training the following week.
