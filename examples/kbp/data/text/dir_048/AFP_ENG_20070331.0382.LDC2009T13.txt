US President George W. Bush on Saturday said Iran's seizure of 15
British sailors and marines was "inexcusable behavior" and he
opposed any "quid pro quos" to get them back.


"It's a serious issue because the Iranians took these people out
of Iraqi waters," Bush told reporters at his mountain retreat
here.


"And it's inexcusable behavior and I strongly support the
(British Prime Minister Tony) Blair government's attempts to
resolve this peacefully," Bush said after talks with Brazilian
President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva.


The US leader rejected suggestions that Washington could help in
the eight-day- old standoff by freeing five Iranians captured by
US forces in northern Iraq in January.


"I support the (British) prime minister when he made it clear
there were no quid pro quos," Bush said. "The Iranians must give
back the hostages."
