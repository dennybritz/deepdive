Serena Williams rallied to beat world number one Justine Henin
0-6, 7-5, 6-3 here Saturday in the women's final of the 6.9
million-dollar Sony Ericsson Open.


Williams, playing her first tournament since she stormed to
victory in the Australian Open in January, saved two match points
in the second set as she claimed her fourth career title at the
prestigious hardcourt tournament in Miami's Key Biscayne.
