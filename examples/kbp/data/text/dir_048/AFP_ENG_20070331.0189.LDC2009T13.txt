Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"The team over the past three-and-a-half years had been playing
and winning matches. There were no such comments. Now they are
spreading such rumours."


- Inzamam-ul-Haq hits out at continuing speculation that
Pakistan's disastrous World Cup campaign and Bob Woolmer's murder
are linked to match-fixing.


"I couldn't believe there wasn't a full house for the West
Indies-Australia game. If the West Indies do go out, there
probably won't be much support around the grounds at all which
will be disappointing in a World Cup."


- Australia skipper Rick Ponting bemused by the fears the already
small crowds at the World Cup will be further reduced if hosts
West Indies go out.


"The team has got a lot of performers these days. At the moment
we are beating some top sides."

"He's a very proud man. He's probably is own harshest critic.
He's pushing himself to the limit at the moment and he wants to
get everything out of these last few games that he possibly can."


- Ponting on evergreen fast bolwer Glenn McGrath.


"You know it takes someone to work for one week to buy a Pakistan
shirt here and we bought them in numbers, but it proved useless
and the Muslims of Guyana are disappointed for we thought they
had the discipline."

Pakistan in the Super Eights
