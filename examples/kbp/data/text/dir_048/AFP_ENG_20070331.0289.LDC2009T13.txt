Hungary's liberal Free Democrats, the junior partner in the left-
leaning coalition government, on Saturday elected Economy
Minister Janos Koka as their new leader.


After narrowly winning the ballot, 34-year-old Koka pledged to
review the coalition agreement with the Socialist party of Prime
Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany.


But analysts expect no major changes in the coalition as Koka has
said that he does not see the need for a government shake-up.


The Socialists rely on the Free Democrats' 20 seats in the
386-seat parliament to form a majority in the legislature. The
Socialists have 190 seats.


The liberals also hold three of 14 ministerial posts in the
government, including Koka's portfolio.


A doctor by training who made a fortune in the late 1990s in the
Hungarian dot- com industry, Koka has set himself the task of
widening the voting base of the liberals who currently poll below
the five percent threshold necessary to enter parliament.


The Free Democrats are traditionally strong in Budapest but are
weak in the countryside, although municipal elections in October
saw their grip loosen on the capital and they were nearly
completely wiped out in other parts of the country.
