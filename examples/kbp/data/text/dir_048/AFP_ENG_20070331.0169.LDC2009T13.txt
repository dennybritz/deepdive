Nepal's parliament delayed Saturday ratifying a landmark pact to
bring Maoist rebels into government and cement an end to a decade
of bloody civil war.


The parliament had been due to give its formal approval to the
deal reached Friday under which the main political parties agreed
to give the Maoists five portfolios in a new cabinet.


But political wrangling including disagreement over cabinet
hierarchy forced postponement of the parliamentary sitting until
Sunday.


Nepal's seven main political parties and the former rebels met in
the prime minister's residence on Saturday to sort out the
differences.


The row did not endanger the decision to admit the Maoists into
the new interim government, said Prakash Sharan Mahat, a lawmaker
from the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party.


"We will meet tomorrow at 8 am (0215 GMT) and sort out these
differences and we will go to parliament around 11 am (0415 GMT)
tomorrow (Sunday) to formalise the cabinet," Mahat said.


The parties were at odds over who should hold the most senior
positions in the cabinet. One of its tasks will be steering the
Himalayan nation to new elections this year.


"The meeting has been postponed until tomorrow morning because
the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified
Marxist-Leninist) could not reach agreement regarding the
ministerial hierarchy in the interim government," said Dev
Gurung, a Maoist leader.


"We don't have any major differences over the structure of the
interim government," Gurung added.
