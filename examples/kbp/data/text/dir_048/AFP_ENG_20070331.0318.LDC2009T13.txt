The Iranian foreign ministry said on Saturday that a British
diplomatic note it had received over the seizure of 15 sailors
"could be examined," but that Tehran awaits a "balanced" attitude
from London.


"In this note there are different points which could be
examined," the foreign ministry said in a statement about a note
it had received from London in response to its formal protest
over the sailors' alleged illegal entry into Iran's territorial
waters.


"We are awaiting a correction of attitude on Britain's part and
adopting a balanced and transparent attitude within the framework
of Iran's legitimate demands," the statement said.
