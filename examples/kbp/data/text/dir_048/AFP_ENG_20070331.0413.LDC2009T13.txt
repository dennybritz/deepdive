Se Ri Pak, seeking to complete a career Grand Slam, seized a
share of the third- round lead here Saturday in the two million-
dollar LPGA Kraft Nabisco Championship.


The South Korean fired a 2-under-par 70 for a 4-under total of
212, level with Norway's Suzann Pettersen.


Pak, seeking her sixth major title and 24th LPGA title overall,
overcame a brace of bogeys on the back nine to put herself in
prime position.


Pettersen, who was runner-up to Lorena Ochoa at last week's
Safeway International in Arizona, is aiming for her first career
US LPGA title. She carded a one-under 71.


Meaghan Francella and Paula Creamer both are a shot back at
3-under.  Francella shot a 69 - the best round of the day - while
Creamer signed for a 73.


Creamer, who won the season-opening tournament in Hawaii, entered
the day tied atop the leaderboard with Ochoa.


Ochoa, the 2006 player of the year who could overtake Annika
Sorenstam for the world No. 1 ranking with her first major title
this week, fell into a tie for 12th with a 77.


Her disappointing round included a quadruple bogey at the par-
three 17th.


Sorenstam, a 10-time major champion, failed to make any inroads
after two disappointing rounds, carding a 1-under 71 for 222.


Defending champion Karrie Webb of Australia carded a 73 for 220.
