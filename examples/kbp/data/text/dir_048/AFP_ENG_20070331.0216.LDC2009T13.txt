George Gillett, one of Liverpool's new American owners, said on
Saturday it was "highly unlikely" that the club would agree to
share their planned new stadium with local rivals Everton.


Liverpool politicians had been hopeful of persuading Gillett and
co-owner Tom Hicks of the merits of ground-sharing.


But Gillett, who was in the stands as Liverpool thrashed Arsenal
4-1 at Anfield on Saturday, indicated that he was unlikely to go
along with such a proposal in the face of opposition from fans.


"We've been asked that a lot, in fact when I went through customs
they weren't going to clear my passport unless I swore I wasn't
going to do stadium sharing!" Gillett said.


"So I'm here and I did reaffirm our commitment to building our
own stadium.


"We have never talked about it with Everton or anyone on their
behalf and I think it's highly unlikely we ever would. It's not a
subject that's even on the agenda."


Gillett also confirmed that he is consulting stadium experts to
see if the capacity of the new stadium could be made bigger than
the 60,000 seats currently envisaged.


Liverpool are close to finalising plans to leave Anfield for the
new ground at nearby Stanley Park in time for the start of the
2009-10 season.


Everton are also planning a move away from Goodison Park, their
home for the last 114 years. The club is currently examining a
proposal for a move to the nearby town of Kirkby because Goodison
cannot be developed beyond its current capacity of 40,000.
