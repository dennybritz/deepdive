South Africa collected three billion more rands in tax revenue
than expected during the 2006-07 fiscal year, mostly due to
economic growth, the finance minister said Saturday.


The government collected 493 billion rands (50 billion euros, 67
billion dollars) for the fiscal year, Trevor Manuel said.


That amounted to an increase of 75 billion rands over the
previous year, the minister added.


Manuel said five-percent economic growth over the last couple
years has led to the creation of more jobs. The past fiscal year
saw the country's first budget surplus in decades.


Higher than expected corporate profits "had a significant impact
on the outcome of revenue collection," he said.


Salary taxes brought in 133 billion rands in revenue, while 118
billion came from corporate profits.


Gross operating surplus in the mining sector increased by 25
percent, while the financial sector grew by 17 percent, said
Manuel. The retail and wholesale sector increased by 10 percent.


South Africa registered annual growth of three percent during its
first decade of democracy, beginning in 1994.


The government has set a target of six percent sustainable growth
from 2010 in a bid to reduce high unemployment that includes
about a third of the active population.
