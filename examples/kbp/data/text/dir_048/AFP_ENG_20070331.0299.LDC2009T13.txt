The director of a climate research project said Saturday that
Russian authorities had disrupted the unique programme by
blocking the delivery of supplies to a boat embedded in the
Arctic ice.


Etienne Bourgois said in a statement that Russian authorities on
Friday stopped a cargo flight from parachuting supplies to the
so-called Tara schooner.


The plane chartered from a Russian company was forced to return
to its departure point in Yaroslavl on Saturday, he said.


Bourgois said the flight plan had been previously approved. It
was stopped at Murmansk in the far northwest of Russia.


The schooner has been within the Arctic ice for seven months and
is expected to remain there until the end of the summer of 2008.
It has a team of eight, including one New Zealand, two Russians
and five French.


The project is part of a European environmental studies
consortium called Damocles.


The programme is designed to provide a secure ice station
reachable by aircraft and ice breaker, and to communicate
information about global climate change.


Thirty tonnes of materials were supposed to arrive at the site.
They included a small bulldozer that would be used to create a
landing strip of 1,000 metres (3,300 feet) and a supply of tents.


Bourgois said it was the second time Russian authorities had
disrupted the work.


"For the moment, the programme continues and we are working to
overcome these new difficulties," he said.


The crew was in good physical and moral condition, Bourgois said.
