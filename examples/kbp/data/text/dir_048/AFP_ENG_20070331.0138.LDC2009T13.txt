France's three-time reigning world champion Sebastien Loeb
increased his lead in the Rally of Portugal, the fifth round of
the championship, here early Saturday.


Loeb had led world championship leader Finland's Marcus Gronholm
by three seconds overnight but had increased that margin to 15
seconds following three special stages.


The Frenchman took two seconds from Gronholm in the first speical
of the day, then another five in the second and four in the third
to put himself further ahead.


"In this rally, there are two main drivers and then the rest,"
said Loeb's co- driver Daniel Elena at a stop in the first
special.


The third-placed driver, Mikko Hirvonen of Finland, was 1min
21sec behind Loeb.
