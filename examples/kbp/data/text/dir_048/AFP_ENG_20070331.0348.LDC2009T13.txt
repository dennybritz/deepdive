Bangladesh were 41-4 after 10 overs in their rain-restricted
World Cup Super Eights match against Australia at the Sir Vivian
Richards Stadium here Saturday.


A wet outfield delayed the start by five hours and meant this
match was reduced to a 22 overs per side contest.


Saqibul Hasan was on 13 with captain Habibul Bashar on three.


Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath created history when he
dismissed  Shahriar Nafees and Aftab Ahmed to pass Pakistan great
Wasim Akram's World Cup record of 54 wickets.


World champions Australia were unchanged from the team that beat
West Indies by 103 runs in their Super Eight opener here
Wednesday.


Bangladesh, in what was their first match of the second round,
brought in Tapash Baisya for fellow pace bowler Syed Rasal in the
only change to the team that defeated Bermuda by seven wickets to
secure their Super Eight spot on Sunday at the Queen's Park Oval
in Port-of-Spain.
