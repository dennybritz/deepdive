Turkish police on Saturday detained two suspected people
smugglers and 83 illegal immigrants planning to cross into Europe
from Turkey's northwestern border with Greece, the Anatolia news
agency reported.


The would-be immigrants -- Pakistanis, Afghans and Bangladeshis
-- were found hidden in a shanty house in the industrial suburb
of Ikitelli, in the European quarter of Istanbul.


Police also detained an Afghan national and a Turk suspected of
organizing the illegal journey for the group.


The illegal immigrants, who were planning to sneak into Greece
and then continue onto various other European countries, had paid
about 7,000 dollars (5,200 euros) a head to the suspected
organizers, Anatolia reported.


Turkey is a major route for human-smuggling from Asia into
Europe, and illegal immigrants are detained almost on a daily
basis.
