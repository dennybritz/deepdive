Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic will be out for up to
five weeks after suffering a dislocated shoulder in his side's
4-1 win over Blackburn on Saturday.


Vidic, 25, was stretchered off midway through the first half at
Old Trafford after landing awkwardly when he challenged for a
corner.


The Serbia international is unlikely to return to action until
late-April at the earliest, leaving United manager Sir Alex
Ferguson short of defensive options.


Gary Neville is sidelined for several weeks with an ankle
problem, while Mikael Silvestre has been ruled out for the rest
of the season with a dislocated shoulder.
