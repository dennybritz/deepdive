Pakistan is sending two senior police officers to Jamaica to help
investigate Bob Woolmer's murder, the country's cricket chief
said on Saturday.


The two will leave on Monday, said Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)
chairman Nasim Ashraf who repeated denials that any Pakistani
players were involved in the crime.


"The Pakistani police team will cooperate with the Jamaican
police," Ashraf told a press conference which was preceded by a
minute's silence for the late coach.


"I have no doubt that our players are innocent," he added.


"We are thankful to the Jamaican prime minister who expedited
clearance of the team."


Woolmer was found strangled in his Kingston hotel room a day
after Pakistan's shock World Cup exit at the hands of Ireland on
March 17.


Ashraf said he would represent "Pakistan and the PCB" at the
former England player's funeral in South Africa on Wednesday.


He added that a three-member committee of former cricketers had
been set up to look into the World Cup failure.


"This inquiry team will evaluate performance of each player and
submit a report after 30 days," he said.


PCB has suspended the players' contracts and new "performance-
based" deals would be signed by the players within 90 days,
Ashraf said.
