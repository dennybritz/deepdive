Real Madrid's Brazilian international right back Cicinho has been
named in the Spanish giants' squad for the first time in more
than six months, the club announced here on Saturday.


Madrid, who lie third in La Liga five points behind their bitter
rivals and league leaders Barcelona, play at struggling Celta
Vigo on Sunday.


Cicinho, who was part of the Brazilian squad at the World Cup
last summer, has recovered after tearing ligaments in his right
knee during a match at Real Betis in September.


"He's still not fully fit but coming back little by little. It's
important that he gets back into the dynamic of the squad and the
group spirit," explained Real coach Fabio Capello.


Spanish international Jose Antonio Reyes has not recovered in
time from his own, less severe, injury to his left knee sustained
earlier this month and, contrary to expectations, will not make
the trip to Vigo.


"He's had more problems today (Saturday) and that's prevented him
travelling," added Capello, who is also without David Beckham.


The former England captain is still on the road to recovery after
an injury to his right knee earlier this month.


"If we are going to win the league then we have to leap into
things in Vigo with the spirit of playing in a final," said
Capello, reflecting on the game itself.
