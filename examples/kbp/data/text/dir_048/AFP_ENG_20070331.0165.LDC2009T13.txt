Unknown assailants shot dead a Muslim cleric as he was returning
to his home in Gaza City early on Saturday morning, a Palestinian
security source said.


"Four unknown men opened fire at Sheikh Mussa al-Manasra, killing
him," the source said, adding that one other person was wounded
in the shooting in the Shejaiya neighbourhood.


Al-Manasra was not linked to any Palestinian faction, he said.


In recent months dozens of Palestinian have been killed in
clashes between feuding Fatah and Hamas factions in the Gaza
Strip, which subsided after the two sides agreed to form a power-
sharing government on March 17.
