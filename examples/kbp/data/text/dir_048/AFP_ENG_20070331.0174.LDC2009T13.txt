Iran's ambassador to Russia denied on Saturday media reports
quoting him as suggesting that the 15 British naval personnel
being held by Iran might be put on trial.


"The network has made a mistake in translating the comments about
detained British personnel and has reported the possibility of
their trial," Gholam Reza Ansari told the Iranian state news
agency IRNA.


Ansari was referring to an interview he had given on Friday night
to Russia's Vesti-24 television.


In comments on the channel's Internet site, Ansari was quoted as
saying "no kind of apology has been received from the British
side and as a result the case has taken on a juridical form.


"If their guilt is really demonstrated, naturally it will result
in punishment. I want to underline that legal proceedings have
already begun."


Earlier, IRNA itself had published what it said were excerpts
from the interview, in which he was Ansari was quoted as saying
"the British marines who entered Iranian waters could go on trial
for this illegal act.


"The legal process has started for the British troops and if the
accusations are proven they will be punished."


But in his statement to IRNA later Saturday, Ansari denied that a
trial might be in the offing.


He told IRNA he had only said "the issue of British forces
detention has entered legal proceedings."
