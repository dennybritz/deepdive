An Iranian exile group claimed Saturday that the capture of 15
British naval personnel was premeditated "to win concessions from
the international community and divert attention from its nuclear
projects."


The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) said that a
Revolutionary Guard garrison was on full alert from the night
before the incident.


Hossein Abedini, of the organisation's foreign affairs committee,
told a press conference in London that the move was a
"meticulously concocted operation".


But the Revolutionary Guard plus Iran's foreign and intelligence
ministries had decided that this fact should be covered up, he
added.


"You can see that the clerical regime had in a premeditated
attack arrested British soldiers in order to win concessions from
the international community and divert attention from its nuclear
projects," he said.


The NCRI said its information had come from within the
Revolutionary Guards through the People's Mojahedin Organisation
of Iran (PMOI), also known as the Mujaheddin e Khalq (MeK), a
dissident movement banned in Britain, the European Union and the
United States.


The organisation, which describes itself as the parliament in
exile of the Iranian resistance, provided no substantive evidence
to back up its claims.
