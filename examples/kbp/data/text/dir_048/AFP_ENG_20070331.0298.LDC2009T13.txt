German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Israel on Saturday on
the second leg of her Middle East tour aimed at putting the EU's
weight behind efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace
process.


Merkel, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, was
welcomed by Israeli Welfare Minister Isaac Herzog at Ben Gurion
Airport as she arrived from neighbouring Jordan where she held
talks with King Abdullah II.


She then headed to Jerusalem for the first of two meetings with
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on her second tour of the region this
year, a German official said.


On Sunday, Merkel will hold a breakfast meeting with Foreign
Minister Tzipi Livni before visiting the Yad Vashem Holocaust
Memorial museum. She will later receive an honorary doctorate
from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.


The 52-year-old chancellor will also travel to the West Bank city
of Ramallah for talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas,
whose moderate Fatah movement has entered a power-sharing
government with the radical Hamas movement, which the EU
considers a terrorist movement.
