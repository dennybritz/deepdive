About 400 people rallied in Rome Saturday to demand the release
of two Afghans who had assisted a kidnapped Italian journalist.


Adjmal Naqshbandi, an Afghan interpreter, was kidnapped in early
March in Afghanistan along with La Repubblica correspondent
Daniele Mastrogiacomo.


Mastrogiacomo, who was held for two weeks and witnessed the
beheading of his Afghan driver, was released in a controversial
swap of five Taliban prisoners. Naqshbandi remains missing.


The second person the crowd rallied for, Rahmatullah Hanefi, is
believed to be held by the Afghan secret service. Hanefi played a
role in freeing the journalist.


He works for a hospital in southern Afghanistan belonging to the
Italian humanitarian organisation Emergency.


Emergency served as intermediary in negotiations to free
Mastrogiacomo.


The journalist's sister appeared at Saturday's rally and
delivered a message from her brother, who she said was
"recuperating."


The message called on the United Nations, nongovernmental
organisations and countries with embassies in Kabul to "do the
maximum for the freedom of two friends."


Two large portraits of the men were displayed on either side of
the speakers' platform.


Giuliana Sgrena, a journalist from Il Manifesto newspaper who was
kidnapped in Iraq in 2005, also attended. She told AFP that
Italians should not be given greater priority over others who are
abducted.


Gino Strada, director of Emergency, said Italy should "assume its
responsibilities" in freeing the men.


The Italian government issued a statement Saturday saying work
was continuing on gaining their freedom.
