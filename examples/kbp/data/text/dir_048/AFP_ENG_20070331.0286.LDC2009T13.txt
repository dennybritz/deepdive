Two workers for delivery company FedEx traveled from Paris to
Vienna in a cargo plane after apparently dozing off, a company
source said Saturday.


The two men were working early Friday at Charles de Gaulle
airport. They are believed to have fallen asleep while waiting
for a freight delivery that didn't arrive, the source said on
condition of anonymity.


The doors for the plane's freight compartment were closed without
anyone noticing they were there, the source said.


So off they went to Austria. The two workers were returned to
France later in the day aboard an Air France flight. The company
has opened an internal investigation to determine what happened.


"There is some doubt as to whether they were really sleeping," a
FedEx spokesperson told AFP. "All we know is that they were
repatriated and they are safe and sound."
