Britain's Victoria Pendleton beat China's Shuang Guo over two
final legs to reclaim her world sprint crown here at the world
track cycling championships Saturday.


Pendleton, who is one of Britain's biggest hopes for Olympic gold
in Beijing next year, cruised to victory in the tactical speed
event by dominating her Chinese rival with relative ease.


Guo went one better than her bronze medal last year to take the
silver, while Australian Anna Meares took bronze after beating
Lisandra Guerra of Cuba to cap a superb third day of competing.


Meares earlier broke her own world record in the women's 500
metre time trial to add the world title to her Olympic gold from
the two-lap event.


While Meares handed Australia their first gold of the
competition, Pendleton's achievements mean Britain now have five
gold medals - and more could be on the way.


Scotland's Craig MacLean is in the semi-finals of the men's
sprint event after knocking out compatriot Ross Edgar 2-1 in
their three-leg quarter-final, which went to a decider.


Pendleton last won the world sprint crown in Los Angeles in 2001.


She also won gold here in the women's inaugural team sprint event
with fellow Englishwoman Shanaze Reade.
