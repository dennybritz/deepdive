Endurance specialist Juan Llaneras handed Spain their first gold
medal of the world track cycling championships in the men's
points race here Saturday.


Llaneras, a former three-time world points champion, claimed a
total of 76 points from the 16 sprints featuring on the frantic
40km race to finish ahead of Belgian Iljo Keisse and Mikhail
Ignatiev of Russia.


Before Saturday the Spaniard last won the title in Manchester in
2000.


Llanera finished on a total of 76 points, with Keisse on 55 and
Ignatiev on 52.


The 37-year-old Llaneras celebrated his fourth title in style,
jumping off his bike and emotionally hugging members of his
family who were among the thousands of Spaniards who turned out
to watch him.
