The Israeli army on Saturday prevented the Hamas-affiliated
Palestinian minister for religious affairs from entering the Tomb
of the Patriarchs in the flashpoint West Bank town of Hebron.


Hussein al-Tanturi was not allowed to enter the site, holy both
to Jews and Muslims, on the day marking the birth of the Prophet
Mohammed.


"A celebration I was supposed to head was underway in the Tomb of
the Patriarchs to mark the birth of the prophet. When we reached
the tomb, the soldiers did not let us in," he told AFP.


"The soldiers told me they were following orders," he said. "This
proves Israel is continuing its aggression against the freedom of
religion" of the Palestinians.


Military sources said "it was decided not to let a Hamas member
enter the Tomb of the Patriarchs due to information he intended
to incite the many Palestinians who had arrived at the site."


Israel refuses to deal with members of the new Palestinian unity
government, which brings together the moderate Fatah faction and
the Islamist movement Hamas, which Israel considers a terrorist
movement.


Several hundred Jews have settled in the heart of Hebron near the
Tomb of the Patriarchs under heavy military protection. Over
120,000 Palestinians live in Hebron, from which the Israeli army
partially withdrew in 1998.
