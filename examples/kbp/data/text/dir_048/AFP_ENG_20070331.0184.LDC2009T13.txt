Peter Crouch hit his first hat-trick for Liverpool as Rafa
Benitez's side routed Arsenal 4-1 to move above the Gunners into
third place in the Premiership on Saturday.


The England striker marked his return from a three-week absence
following surgery on a nose injury by scoring twice in the first
half to set Arsenal on the way to their biggest league defeat for
six years.


Daniel Agger scored Liverpool's third on the hour before William
Gallas pulled one back, but Crouch had the last word with a fine
close range finish.


Liverpool are now two points ahead of Arsenal after a victory
that gave them a measure of revenge for the three defeats Arsene
Wenger's side had inflicted on them earlier this season.
