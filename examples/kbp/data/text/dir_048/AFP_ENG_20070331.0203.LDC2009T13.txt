The Israeli army on Saturday prevented the Hamas-affiliated
Palestinian minister for religious affairs from entering the Tomb
of the Patriarchs in the West Bank flashpoint town of Hebron, he
said.


Hussein al-Tanturi was not allowed to enter the site, holy both
to Jews and Muslims, on the day marking the birth of the Prophet
Mohammed.


"A celebration I was supposed to head was underway in the Tomb of
the Patriarchs to mark the birth of the prophet. When we reached
the tomb, the soldiers did not let us in," he told AFP.


"When I asked for the reason, the soldiers told me they were
following orders," he said, adding that "this proves Israel is
continuing its aggression against the freedom of religion" of the
Palestinians.


An army spokeswoman said that "he was not allowed to enter due to
a decision by the Defence Ministry."


The Defence Ministry did not have any immediate comment.


Israel refuses to have any doing with members of the new
Palestinian unity government, which brings together the moderate
Fatah movement and the Islamic Fatah, which Israel considers a
terrorist movement.


Several hundreds of Jewish settlers live in the heart of Hebron
and adjacent to the Tomb of the Patriarchs under heavy military
protection.


Over 120,000 Palestinians live in the Palestinian part of Hebron,
from which the Israeli army withdrew in 1998.
