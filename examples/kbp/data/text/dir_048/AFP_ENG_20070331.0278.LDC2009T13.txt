France's three-time reigning world champion Sebastien Loeb
steadily increased his lead in the Rally of Portugal, the fifth
round of the championship, on Saturday.


Loeb had led world championship leader Marcus Gronholm of Finland
by three seconds overnight but had increased that margin to 15
seconds following three special stages and by more than 40
seconds at the end of the day.


The third-placed driver, Mikko Hirvonen of Finland, was 1min
57.3sec behind Loeb.


The Frenchman won all six special stages of the day, from special
8 to 13, to completely dominate the race and put him on course to
take the overall lead in the championship should he win on
Sunday.


"In this rally, there are two main drivers and then the rest,"
said Loeb's co- driver Daniel Elena at a stop in the first
special.
