A top Iranian army official warned Arab states neighbouring
Israel against a "Zionist suicide attack" in the summer, the
semi-official Fars news agency reported on Saturday.


"The Zionists plan to carry out a suicide plot in the summer," it
quoted Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, Iran's armed forces
joint chief of staff, as saying.


"I warn Islamic brothers and leaders in countries neighbouring
the occupied land that they are seriously threatened by this
Zionist suicide attack," the general said.


He predicted that an Israeli attack would start from Lebanon and
Syria and proceed to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.


Firouzabadi said the plan was aimed at preventing the United
States from withdrawing its forces from Iraq and the Middle East.


"The American poeple, senate and congress have realised their
interests are being sacrificed to Zionists' evil, and decided to
pull out US forces from the region," he said.


"But the Zionists and US neo-cons want to justify a US presence
in the region," he said, calling on "Arab brothers to unify their
front against Israel and in defence of the Palestinians."


Iran does not recognise Israel, and its hardline President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called for the Jewish state to be wiped
from the map.
