The start of the World Cup Super Eight match between Australia
and Bangladesh at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was delayed
because of a wet outfield.


Umpires Aleem Dar of Pakistan and New Zealand's Billy Bowden were
due to hold a pitch inspection at the scheduled start time of
9.30am local time (1330GMT).


Overnight rain had caused several wet patches to form near the
edge of the boundary, making conditions potentially dangerous for
fieldsmen.


Reigning champions Australia, bidding to become the first side to
win three successive World Cups after their 1999 and 2003
triumphs, won their opening second round match against hosts West
Indies by 103 runs here on Wednesday.


This match was Bangladesh's first in the Super Eights.
