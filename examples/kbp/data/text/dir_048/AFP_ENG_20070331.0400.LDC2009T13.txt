More than nine out of 10 people in the United States believe in
God, according to a poll published Saturday.


The study published by Newsweek magazine found 91 percent of
people said that they believed in God, with 87 percent claiming
to follow a formal religion. Six percent professed not to believe
in God.


Most respondents -- 82 percent of those polled -- called
themselves Christians, and five percent said they followed a non-
Christian religion such Judaism, Islam or Buddhism.


The poll showed 48 percent of respondents rejected the scientific
theory of human evolution. Of respondents with a university
degree, one in three said they accepted as fact the "creationist"
view, the Biblical explanation that humans were created by God.


Sixty-two percent of the 1,004 adults polled said they would not
vote for a political candidate who was an atheist.
