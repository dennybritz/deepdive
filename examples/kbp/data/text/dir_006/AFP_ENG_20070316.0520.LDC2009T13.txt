A security lockdown gripped the White House for more than three
hours Friday after a man carrying a package jumped the fence
surrounding the presidential compound, a security official said.


The precaution froze pedestrian traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue in
front of the mansion from the time of the incident at about 11:10
am (1500 GMT) to roughly 2:29 pm (1815 GMT) when the all-clear
was given.


Kim Bruce, a spokeswoman for the Secret Service charged with US
President George W. Bush's safety, identified the fence jumper as
Catalino Diaz, a 66-year-old black male from Florida but with no
fixed address.


Diaz, who threw a bag over the fence, has been handed over to
Washington police for questioning and is expected to be charged
with unlawful entry, Bruce told AFP by telephone.
