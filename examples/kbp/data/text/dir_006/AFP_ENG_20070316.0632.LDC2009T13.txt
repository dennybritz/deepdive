As Tiger Woods floundered, Rocco Mediate rocketed up the
leaderboard Friday, seizing the halfway lead in the 5.5 million-
dollar Arnold Palmer International.


Mediate fired a 5-under-par 65 to surge past Woods and take a
three-shot lead with a 9-under total of 131.


Woods had held a share of the first-round lead after a 64 on
Thursday. But the world No. 1 stumbled to a 3-over 73 on Friday
to fall six shots adrift.


Woods, who won this tournament four straight times from 2000, had
just two birdies and three bogeys to go with a stunning double-
bogey at the par-5 fifth hole.


Mediate followed his opening-round 66 with another crisp effort,
producing six birdies, including Nos. 1 and 2, and just one
bogey.


Britain's Paul Casey, who began the day tied for the lead, shot
an even-par 70 and was tied for second with John Rollins at 134.


Rollins matched Mediate's round with a bogey-free 65.


Spain's Sergio Garcia (69) was in a logjam at 135, tied with
Shaun Micheel, Ben Curtis, Canada's Stephen Ames and first-round
co-leader Vaughn Taylor.


South Africa's Trevor Immelman was amng a group of four players
on 136, while South African Retief Goosen joined Woods in a group
of six players at 137.
