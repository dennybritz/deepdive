NATO member states will support broader sanctions against Iran
which are expected to be approved by the UN Security Council,
NATO special envoy to the Caucasus and Central Asia said Friday.


Robert Simmons also said at a press conference in Baku that the
NATO alliance has no plans for military action against the
Islamic state after talks on Iran and regional security with
Azerbaijani officials.


On Thursday, six major world powers agreed a proposal for new UN
sanctions against Iran over its repeated refusal to suspend
uranium enrichment -- a process that can be used to make nuclear
fuel as well as atomic weapons.


Simmons also emphasised NATO's "open-door" policy to expansion,
saying any country in Europe or the Caucasus was welcome to apply
for membership. Two ex- Soviet republics, Georgia and Ukraine,
are bidding to join the alliance.
