The US government Friday all but ruled out the chances of a free-
trade deal with Malaysia before a crucial deadline expires.


Steve Norton, a spokesman for US Trade Representative Susan
Schwab, said the Malaysian cabinet remained locked in debate
about crucial provisions of the deal including government
procurement rules.


"That process is continuing in the Malaysian cabinet. But I think
it's clear at this point that getting the free trade agreement
done under current TPA is improbable," he told AFP.


The timetable is tightening because US President George W. Bush
loses his Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which allows deals to
be fast-tracked through Congress, on July 1.
