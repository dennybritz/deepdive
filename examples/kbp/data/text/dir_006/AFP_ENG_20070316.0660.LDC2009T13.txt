Former US Open champ Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Sybille Bammer
6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-1 in the semi-finals of the ATP/WTA Pacific
Life Open on Friday.


In the final, Kuznetsova will play Daniela Hantuchova, who
defeated China's Li Na 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 earlier Friday.


Kuznetsova had 39 winners, six double faults and 48 unforced
errors in the two hour, 39 minute match at the main Indian Wells
Tennis Garden stadium.


The 21-year-old Kuznetsova is hitting her stride after getting
off to a shaky start to the season, losing to Justin Henin in the
semis of the Dubai tournament.


When Kuznetsova lost the first set it was just the second set she
has dropped in the tournament.


Austria's Bammer, 26, had 41 unforced errors and had her serve
broken five times.


The 33rd seeded Bammer has a five year old daughter who travels
with her. She is the only mother in the top 100 ranked players on
the tour.


Kuznetsova now holds a 2-0 career record over Bammer having
beaten her at the 2006 Berlin tournament.
