An Iraqi man whose German wife has been kidnapped in Iraq along
with their son has recorded a video message pleading for their
release, Germany's ZDF German television said on Friday.


A spokesman for ZDF said Mohamed Al Tornachi's message would be
broadcast on channels in Germany and in the Arabic world later on
Friday.


In the video, Tornachi asks the kidnappers to show mercy to his
wife Um Mazin, whose German name is Hannelore Krause, and their
son Sinan, 20.


"It is 39 days since they were kidnapped. We thank God that they
are still alive. Please continue to treat my wife and son with
respect. Show mercy, because Islam is a religion of peace and
kindness."


Tornachi said his wife, who is 61, settled in Iraq 40 years ago
and loved the country. His family has no political influence, he
added.


"We as a family have no influence on political decisions. So I
beg you, free my wife and son."


The video includes an emotional message from his daughter-in-law.


"I am Sinan's wife. We were married less than three months ago
and I hope that he will come back to me soon. Please release my
husband and mother-in-law," said the woman, whose name was not
given.


Last weekend, a militant Islamist group in Iraq called the Kataeb
Siham al-Haq (Righteous Arrows Battalions) threatened to execute
the hostages unless Germany pulls its troops out of Afghanistan.


They were kidnapped on February 6.


German President Horst Koehler on Wednesday also called for their
release in a video message.
