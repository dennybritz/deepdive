A scuffle broke out between two deputies in Azerbaijan's
parliament on Friday as the government presented a report on the
oil-rich country's booming economy.


Independent deputy Husseyn Abdullayev and pro-government deputy
Fazail Agamaly exchanged insults and blows after Abdullayev
accused the government of "deceiving parliament" in its report.


In his report, Prime Minister Artur Rasizade praised the
government's economic record and said Azerbaijan's gross national
product had grown at a rate of 34.5 percent in 2006.


Since 2003, Rasizade said, average salaries have more than
doubled and defence spending has risen 140 percent.


Azerbaijan's economy has grown rapidly since the 1994 signing of
its so-called "contract of the century."


Under the deal, a host of Western oil companies headed by
Britain's BP were given access to Azerbaijan's energy reserves
and agreed to build an export pipeline to Turkey that began
operating last year.
