Five people were killed and more than 15 injured after a grenade
exploded during a birthday party in the western Philippines, a
national police statement said Saturday.


Members of a group called "Commando Brotherhood" were holding a
party in Rizal town on the island of Palawan late Friday when a
grenade suddenly exploded, killing the head of the group and four
other people, the police statement said.


It was not clear if the grenade was thrown by someone or if it
was an accident.


The police did not say what kind of group the "Commando
Brotherhood" was. Criminal gangs and vigilante groups in the
Philippines often use paramilitary names and have ready access to
weapons such guns and grenades.
