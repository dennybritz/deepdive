Worcester completed a magnificent 23-21 fightback victory against
Newcastle to ease their relegation plight in this English
Premiership rugby fixture at Sixways on Friday night.


The Warriors had trailed 21-6 at half-time but then score 17
unanswered points to take the win.


The Warriors looked down and out at half-time after Falcons
scored three converted tries through flanker Ben Woods (2) and
hooker Matt Thompson.


But they rallied magnificently as substitute hooker Aleki Lutui
claimed two tries before his fellow replacement Gavin Quinnell
rumbled over deep into injury time.


Newcastle, though, should have snatched victory with the game's
final kick, but fly-half Loki Crichton, who had earlier slotted
three conversions, missed a 20-metre penalty from in front of the
posts.


As the kick drifted wide, so Worcester started celebrating as
they climbed off the Premiership basement for the first time this
season.


Worcester are now one point above Northampton, who have two games
in hand, with Warriors' league campaign just three matches -
against Bristol, London Irish and Saracens - away from its
conclusion.
