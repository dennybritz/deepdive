The Tokyo Tower, the tallest structure in Japan and a major
tourist attraction, will turn green on Saturday evening to mark
St. Patrick's Day.


The television tower, coated with red-and-white paint and
standing 333 meters (1,092 feet), will be lit green for one night
to also celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bilateral ties
between Japan and Ireland, a tower official has said.


"The public seem to enjoy it when we change the colour of the
tower. It certainly gets people's attention," he said.


Irish Network Japan, a non-governmental organisation aimed at
promoting cultural exchange between Ireland and Japan, will
organise a photography contest of the green-lit Tokyo Tower for
amateur photographers, it said on its website.


Eight parades will be held in Tokyo and other cities across Japan
this month and next to celebrate the Irish holiday.


St. Patrick's Day is slowly receiving wider recognition in Japan,
particularly in urban areas with expatriates.
