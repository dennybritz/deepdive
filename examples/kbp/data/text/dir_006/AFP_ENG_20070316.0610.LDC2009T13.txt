Russia's food monitoring agency said Friday it had discovered
salmonella in chicken meat imported from Germany, the latest
violation in an ongoing dispute over meat imports from the
European Union.


The bacterial infection was discovered in a delivery of
approximately 65,000 tons of meat from three German companies,
whose exports have since been halted pending a German
investigation, Rosselkhoznadzor said in a statement.


The agency, which claims some recent EU meat exports have fallen
short of Russian sanitary standards, has warned it would halt all
imports of animal products from the bloc unless detailed sanitary
reports from each member state are provided by March 31.


In recent months salmonella has been found in meat deliveries
from Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, while listeria
has been discovered in Dutch meat imports, the agency said.


An EU delegation tried in vain to resolve the dispute in talks in
Moscow on Monday and Tuesday.


A Russian embargo on meat from Poland, which continues to block
negotiations on a wide-ranging Russia-EU partnership agreement,
was also discussed.
