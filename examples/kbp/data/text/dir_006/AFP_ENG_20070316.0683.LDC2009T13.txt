US sales of Wii video game consoles nearly matched those of
rivals Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 combined, according to figures
released on Friday by NPD Group.


While Nintendo's Wii was proving to be a powerful contender in
the gaming console battle, it had a lot of ground to cover to
catch up with the 5.1 million Xbox 360 consoles Microsoft had
sold as of last month, NPD reported.


Xbox was released a year before Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 made
their US debuts in November of 2006. Neither Wii nor PlayStation
3 sales have breached two million units, according to NPD.
