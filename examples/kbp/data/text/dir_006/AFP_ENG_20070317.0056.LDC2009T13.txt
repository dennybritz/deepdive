Pakistani police Saturday fired teargas shells to disperse
hundreds of protesting lawyers here in continuing unrest over the
suspension of the country's top judge, witnesses said.


The lawyers gathered in the high court compound in this eastern
city but police prevented from them from coming out for a march
on the street, witnesses said.


Police lobbed teargas shells when the stone-pelting lawyers
attempted to break through the high court's gates, police officer
Mohammad Azeem said.


The lawyers had called a convention to discuss further action
after last Friday's suspension of chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad
Chaudhry by President Pervez Musharraf, their representative Arif
Sheikh said.


Since last week lawyers have staged daily demonstrations in
various urban centers in Pakistan and opposition political
parties have also joined the protest.
