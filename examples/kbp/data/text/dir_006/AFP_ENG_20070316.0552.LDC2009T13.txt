The French-Spanish tobacco company Altadis has decided to open
talks with Philip Morris, the world's leading cigarette maker,
that could lead to a bid for Imperial Tobacco of Britain, a press
report said here Friday.


Altadis declined to comment on the report, which appeared on the
website of the newspaper elEconomista. The paper cited sources
close to the matter.


Imperial Tobacco said Thursday it had made an informal takeover
offer for Altadis worth about 11.5 billion euros (15.2 billion
dollars).


elEconomista reported in late February that Philip Morris, which
is controlled by the Altria group, had asked investment banks to
determine if Altadis could help it acquire Imperial Tobacco, the
world's fourth largest tobacco group.


Analysts at Goldman Sachs have said a joint operation by Altria
and Altadis would be Altria's last chance to buy Imperial
Tobacco.


They said Altria, because of competition regulations in the
United States and Germany, would need a third party to acquire
the assets of Imperial, adding that Altadis was the only
candidate for such a venture.
