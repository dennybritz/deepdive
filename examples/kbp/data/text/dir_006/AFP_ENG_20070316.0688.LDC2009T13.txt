Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen in a Ferrari took pole position for
Sunday's Australian Grand Prix here Saturday.


World champion Fernando Alonso in a McLaren was second while
German Nick Heidfeld in a BMW-Sauber will start from third spot
on the inside of the second row.


It was Raikkonen's 13th career pole and he will be chasing his
10th GP win in Sunday's season-opening race around the Albert
Park street circuit.


Raikkonen, who was brought in by Ferrari this season to replace
retired seven- times world champion Michael Schumacher, clocked
one minute 26.072 seconds and has been the fastest driver in
practice and qualifying this week.


Alonso, who won back-to-back world drivers' titles with Renault
before switching to McLaren, will start alongside Raikkonen on
the front row of the grid after his 1:26.493.


The Spaniard bumped his rookie teammate Lewis Hamilton (1:26.755)
out of  second spot late in the session and in turn Heidfeld
claimed the inside of the second row with his best effort of
1:26.556.


Heidfeld's Polish teammate Robert Kubica made it a great
qualifying session for BMW-Sauber by claiming inside of the third
row.
