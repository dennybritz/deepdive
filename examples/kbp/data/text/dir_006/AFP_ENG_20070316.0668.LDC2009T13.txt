Microsoft on Friday began offering large businesses rewards if
they have employees scout the Internet with the software giant's
Live Search service.


In a move intended to wrest users from rival search engines such
as market- dominating Google, Microsoft will give business
customers service or training credits based on how much employees
use Live Search.


"We are conducting a trial program through which Microsoft is
providing service or training credits to a select number of
enterprise customers based on the number of Web search queries
conducted by their employees via Live Search," the Redmond,
Washington, company said in a written statement.


"As search evolves into more of a productivity tool, and revenue
sharing becomes more commonplace across the industry, we are
engaging in mutually beneficial partnerships such as this and our
recently announced a deal with Lenovo to more easily enable
customers to choose Live Search."


Microsoft announced a deal this month to pre-install software
that makes Live.com the default page in computers made by the
China-based Lenovo.


Google has a deal with US computer maker Dell to preload its
search engine tool bar on that company's machines.


Microsoft would not disclose how the credits are calculated,
saying it depended on the number of personal computers enrolled
in the program and the amount of Live Search use.
