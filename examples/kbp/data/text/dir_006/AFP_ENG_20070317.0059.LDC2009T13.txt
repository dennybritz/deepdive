US forces detained 18 suspected militants on Saturday in a series
of raids targeting Al-Qaeda networks in Iraq, the military said.


Twelve suspects were detained southeast of Balad in northern Iraq
while six were arrested in the former rebel bastion of Fallujah
in the western province of Anbar, a statement said.


The raids also uncovered large ammunition caches and devices used
in making roadside bombs, it added.


US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver said
the arrests were a blow to Al-Qaeda.


"The loss of even lower-echelon members diminishes the
organisation's ability to attack innocent civilians as well as
Iraqi and coalition forces."
