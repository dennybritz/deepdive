Belgian police have seized a record 45 tonnes of hashish worth
225 million euros at Antwerp port and broken a smuggling ring
reaching to the Netherlands, prosecutors said Friday.


The shipment, which was intercepted in February and probably
bound for the Netherlands, "was hidden in metallic cylinders
under scrap iron in 10 containers," Antwerp prosecutors said in a
statement.


"It's probably the biggest drug haul ever made in the port of
Antwerp and in Belgium," it said.


On March 8, police seized 108 kilograms of heroine with a street
value of two million euros, which was also hidden in metallic
cylinders under scrap metal.


The seizures, which were part of a broad investigation targeting
a "large criminal organisation" with help from Dutch police, led
to the arrest of 11 people.


Belgium has requested the extradition from the Netherlands of
four people suspected to be involved in the smuggling operation.
