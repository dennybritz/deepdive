Newly-promoted Cottbus claimed a valuable three points with a 1-0
away win over troubled Hertha Berlin in the German Bundesliga
here on Friday.


The win moves Cottbus provisionally up the table from 14th to
ninth position, while Hertha Berlin move further away from their
main objective this season, a European place next term.


Romanian striker Sergiu Marian Radu scored the only goal of the
encounter breaking the deadlock two minutes into the second half.


Leaders Schalke 04 are in action on Saturday when they take on
third-placed VfB Stuttgart. Fourth-placed Bayern Munich, who are
six points adrift of Schalke, travel to Eintracht Frankfurt in a
bid to close the gap at the top of the table.
