Star Wars robot R2-D2 took up his position on a Hollywood street
Friday, a few yards from where Darth Vader and Chewbacca
lookalikes prowl for photo-ops with tourists.


The R2-D2 in question is one of around 400 mailboxes that are
being revamped with special packaging to make them look like the
famous chirruping robot from the science-fiction film, which is
marking its 30th anniversary this year.


The mailboxes is situated near the famous Grauman's Chinese
Theatre in Hollywood -- one of the first cinemas to screen Star
Wars 30 years ago.


Customers will be able to use the R2-D2 boxes just like any of
the 280,000 postal service mailboxes around the country.


A stamp commemorating Star Wars, which was released on May 25,
1977, is to be unveiled later this year, officials from the US
Postal Service have said.
