Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer said Salzburg's bid for the
2014 Winter Olympics could not be measured in monetary terms
during the third day of the visit by the IOC evaluation
commission on Friday.


The Austrian city is up against the Russian Black Sea resort of
Sochi and South Korea's Pyeongchang to host the 2014 event.
Salzburg's budget is expected to be just 920 million euros while
the budgets for the other two cities run into the billions.


"What we are offering, money cannot buy," Gusenbauer told the
press following a meeting with 13 International Olympic Committee
representatives at Salzburg. "We have charm, a warmth of welcome,
the countryside and very professional organisers. We don't want a
monetary competition."


Unlike the other two bids, Salzburg has virtually all of the
necessary infrastructure in place, a long history in winter
sports and, according to Gusenbauer "security conditions among
the best in the world."


The IOC evaluation commission, which concludes its visit with a
press conference on Saturday, will file its report in June before
the name of the winning host city will be announced by the IOC on
July 4 in Guatemala City.
