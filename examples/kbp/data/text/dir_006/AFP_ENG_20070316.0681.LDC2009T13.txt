Six people were found alive after being missing for more than two
weeks in eastern Indonesian waters, an official said Saturday.


"(Friday) night Doctor Juliana Carolus and friends, who were
missing since February 28, were found alive in the Dobo waters,"
ministry of health official Rustam Pakaya told AFP.


Carolus, head of the health office in the Tanimbar isles, with
five of her staff, left on a speedboat on February 27 from the
town of Saumlaki on the way to Kormomolin, about two hours away
by speedboat.


The Dobo waters, where they were found, are about 400 kilometres
(250 miles) away from where they set off.


The group was reported to have been found by fishermen, floating
near the Papua mainland. They are all reported as being well.
