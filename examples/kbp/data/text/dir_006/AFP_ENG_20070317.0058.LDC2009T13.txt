Seven people were killed and 50 injured Saturday when a passenger
plane made a crash landing in Samara, 1,100 kilometers east of
Moscow, officials told Russian media.


"The crash landing took place at 9:40 a.m. (0640 GMT) at the
Samara airport. The plane's fuselage broke apart during the
landing," Irina Adrianova, a spokeswoman for the emergency
situations ministry, told state television channel Vesti-24.


Of the 57 people on board, seven people died and 50 were injured,
the RIA Novosti news agency quoted a ministry spokesperson as
saying.


According to preliminary information, the plane, a Tupolev Tu-134
operated by local airline YUT-Air, crashed when its landing gear
failed to deploy, officials said.


The injured passengers were taken from the site of the crash at
Samara airport to local hospitals.


The crash came three days after a Boeing 737 carrying 143
passengers made an emergency landing in Moscow after experiencing
problems in one of its two engines. No one was injured in the
incident.


Russia suffered its worst-ever year for air safety in 2006, with
33 accidents leaving 318 dead -- a six-fold increase over 2005 --
according to a report by the Interstate Aviation Committee, a
joint group involving former Soviet states.


The report blamed human error for 70 percent of Russia's air
accidents over the past five years.
