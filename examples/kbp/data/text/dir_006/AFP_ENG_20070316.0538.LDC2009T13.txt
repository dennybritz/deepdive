A payment dispute that delayed construction of Iran's first
nuclear reactor could be resolved next week, the Russian firm
building the reactor said Friday.


"There has been no result in the negotiations so far, but they
have lasted so long that we hope they will end next week," Irina
Yesipova, a spokeswoman for state-owned company Atomstroiexport,
told AFP.


Russia last week accused Iran of withholding payments for the
Bushehr reactor, estimated to be worth more than one billion
dollars (750 million euros). Tehran has rejected the charge.


Negotiators have been working intensively in Tehran and Moscow to
resolve the disagreement in order to complete the reactor, which
was scheduled to open in September.


International pressure has grown on Iran to suspend its nuclear
programme and on Thursday six major global powers agreed to
impose fresh sanctions on the Islamic republic for failing to do
so.


They accuse it of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon but Iran
says it is only building up a civilian nuclear energy programme.
