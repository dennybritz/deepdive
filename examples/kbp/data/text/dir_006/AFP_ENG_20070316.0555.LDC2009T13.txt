Hundreds of supporters of Nigeria's vice president Atiku Abubakar
protested on Friday against his exclusion from the country's
presidential election next month, witnesses said.


The supporters marched to the offices of the Nigeria's electoral
commission in the northern city of Bauchi and submitted a letter
calling Abubakar's name to be included on a list of candidates
cleared to stand for the April 21 vote.


They also warned that his exclusion could derail the poll, said
local journalist Godwin Agbara, who witnessed the protest.


In Katsina, another northern city, hundreds of supporters from
Abubakar's Action Congess party were barred by the police from
staging a similar protest.


On Thursday the electoral agency had omitted Abubakar from its
list of 24 candidates cleared to run in the presidential poll in
a decision criticised as being politically motivated.


The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) argues that
Abubakar was indicted on corruption charges in September 2006 and
is therefore barred from running by law.


Abubakar's supporters say the whole case against him was
politically motivated by his enemies within Nigeria.


The corruption case against the vice president came after he fell
out with his boss, President Olusegun Obasanjo, who vowed that
Abubakar would not succeed him.


Meanwhile, Abubakar on Friday in Abuja Federal High Court
challenged the power of INEC to exclude or disqualify him from
the poll.
