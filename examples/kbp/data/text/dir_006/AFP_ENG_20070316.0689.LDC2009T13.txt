The World Swimming Championships that started Saturday will be
the biggest aquatics event ever staged, with 173 countries
sending athletes, officials said.


It surpasses the previous highest total of 157 countries at the
world championships in Barcelona in 2003.


With the Beijing Olympics just over a year away, China has sent
more competitors (109) than any other country, with the United
States second and host nation Australia third.


"More aquatics athletes will compete at the championships than at
the Sydney and Athens Olympic Games, making this the biggest
aquatics event ever held," said Victorian state Minister for
Sport and Recreation James Merlino.


"This is the last major international aquatics competition before
the 2008 Beijing Olympics and China is shaping as a dominant
force with 109 competitors ahead of the United States (95)
Australia (93) and Russia (89)."


In total, 2,195 athletes from all corners of the globe will take
part.


Organisers estimate one billion people will watch the event on
television.


The championships opened with synchronised swimming preliminary
rounds. The first medals will be awarded on Sunday.
