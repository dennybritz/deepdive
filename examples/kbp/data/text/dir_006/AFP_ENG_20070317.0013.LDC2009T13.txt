Japanese police has told a closed-door UN panel meeting in Vienna
there are at least three stimulant drug plants in North Korea,
reports said Saturday.


Hirohito Yoshimura, deputy commissioner general of the National
Police Agency (NPA), raised suspicion of the facilities in a
speech at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs meeting on
Wednesday, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported, citing unnamed
government sources.


The NPA examined the components of stimulants seized in seven
smuggling cases from 1997 to 2006, and determined that Pyongyang
was involved in an organised way, it said.


The Kyodo news agency reported a similar story.


Last July, Japan's national police chief Iwao Uruma claimed that
North Korean government was involved in a large drug smuggling
operation into Japan in 2002.


In May, Japanese police arrested three men over the 2002
operation. They were accused of smuggling several hundred
kilogrammes of amphetamines into Japan using a North Korean ship.
