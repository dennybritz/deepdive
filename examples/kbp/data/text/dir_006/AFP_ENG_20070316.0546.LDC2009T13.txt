A German nurse stands accused of killing six patients at Europe's
biggest hospital, the Charite in Berlin, and trying to kill
another two, a state prosecutor said on Friday.


The 54-year-old nurse was arrested last October and has confessed
to killing four patients.


Sh has told investigators she did it to spare them further
suffering. Most of the victims were elderly.


The prosecutor said the nurse was initially suspected of five-
fold murder and one case of attempted murder but new evidence
surrounding the death of two patients has led to further charges.


The two men were given overdoses of blood pressure medication
while they were in intensive care with heart problems. One died
as a direct result, while the other succumbed to internal
bleeding.


The nurse will therefore be charged with attempted murder over
the second the death, the prosecutor said.


In 2006, a male nurse was sentenced to life in prison in Germany
for administering lethal injections to 28 mostly elderly
patients.
