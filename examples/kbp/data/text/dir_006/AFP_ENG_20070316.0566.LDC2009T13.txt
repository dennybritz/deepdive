EU countries could slap visa restrictions on Canadians unless
Ottawa lifts a ban on free access on eight new European Union
members, officials and press reports said Friday.


The threat has been made in an EU document sent to the Canadian
authorities, which was printed in the daily La Presse on Friday.


Before the enlargement of the European Union on May 1, 2004, all
EU visitors could enter Canada without a visa, under a
reciprocity deal.


But visitors from eight of the 12 new EU members, mostly former
Soviet bloc countries in eastern Europe, still have to apply for
visas, with free access only being granted to travelers from
Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary and Malta.


A spokesman for the European Commission in Ottawa told AFP that
the new EU member nations affected by the visa restrictions were
very upset.


"If you talk to some of the member states that are affected by
this present regime, they are not happy, they use much stronger
language than I do in trying to tell you what our issue is and
why it's a problem," said Roy Christensen.


The EU and Canada are discussing the issue, and it is hoped that
some progress will be made before a summit between the two set
for June 4.


Ottawa defended the visa restrictions saying it has the right to
protect its borders, and raised with EU envoys such issues as
"corruption, fraud, organized crime and the risk of an influx of
Roma people to Canada," La Presse said.
