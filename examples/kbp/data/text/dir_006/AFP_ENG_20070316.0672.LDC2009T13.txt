Reigning National Basketball Association champions Miami were
back on top Friday, claiming a share of their division lead with
a 103-97 victory over Sacramento.


O'Neal scored 23 points and Eddie Jones added 19 for the Heat,
who extended their winning streak to nine games.


Jason Williams also had 19 points and James Posey added 16 and 11
rebounds for Miami, who improved to 36-29 and moved into a
virtual tie with idle Washington for first place in the NBA's
Southeast Division.


O'Neal connected on 8-of-16 from the floor and had 13 at halftime
for the Heat, who held a 56-45 lead entering the third quarter.


Jones and Williams combined to shoot 10-of-16 from the arc for
Miami, which extended its home winning streak to 14.


The streak matches the second longest in franchise history - from
March 3 to November 9, 2004.


The Heat shot 55 percent and are now 10-2 without superstar
Dwyane Wade, who is out at least another month rehabilitating a
dislocated shoulder.


Ron Artest scored 32 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Mike
Bibby added 21 points for Sacramento, which has lost seven
straight to Miami and five in a row overall.
