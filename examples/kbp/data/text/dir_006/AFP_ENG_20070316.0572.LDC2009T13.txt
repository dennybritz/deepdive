Convalescing Cuban President Fidel Castro has gained weight and
is exercising daily, Cuba's Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque
said on Friday during a visit to Portugal.


The 80-year-old leader "is recuperating progressively and his
recovery is constant", he told reporters after holding talks in
Lisbon with his Portuguese counterpart Luis Amado, the Lusa news
agency reported.


Castro, who led Cuba since its 1959 revolution, temporarily
handed over power to his brother Raul, 75, on July 31 after
undergoing intestinal surgery.


But on Thursday the leader of Cuba's national assembly, Ricardo
Alarcon, suggested Castro could soon resume his presidential
duties.


"I am certain he will be in perfect condition to continue
assuming this responsibility," he told journalists when asked if
the older Castro would seek re-election in 2008.


Since Castro stepped aside, he has appeared six times in film
footage to show he was recuperating, the most recent on January
30.


Video footage of a meeting between Castro and Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez held in January showed the Cuban leader
looking healthier and more alert than he did in previous pictures
of him, though he appeared to have difficulty talking.
