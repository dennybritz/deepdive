The six-nation talks working group on North Korea's nuclear
programme launched its first meeting Saturday in Beijing, the
Chinese foreign ministry confirmed.


The meeting was presided over by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu
Dawei, chief negotiator of the Chinese delegation, according to
the official Xinhua news agency.


Representatives of other five parties were North Korea's Kim
Song-Gi, US top nuclear negotiator Christopher Hill, South
Korea's Chun Yung-Woo, and Russian ambassador Grigory
Berdennikov.


Japan was represented by its ambassador in charge of the North
Korean nuclear issue Suda Akio and its chief negotiator for six-
party talks Kenichiro Sasae.


Shortly before the working group meeting began, North Korea's top
negotiator, Kim Kye-Gwan, arrived in the Chinese capital, ahead
of the new round of six- party talks to open on Monday.


On his arrival he said North Korea will not shut down its nuclear
facilities until the US releases funds frozen in a Macau bank,
Banco Delta Asia, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
