A left knee injury will sideline Washington's All-Star forward
Caron Butler for seven to 10 days, the Wizards said Friday.


The National Basketball Association club said Butler wouldn't
travel with the team on it's five-game West Coast road trip March
20-26.


"Caron has been evaluated and he is going to miss 7-10 days,"
Wizards coach Eddie Jordan said. "He will not make the trip out
West with us. He is going to continue to rehab here while we are
away, and we will re-evaluate him next week."


Butler, 27, underwent an MRI and was pleased to learn he will not
be sidelined for an extended period.


"There is a lot of stiffness in my knee," he said. "The MRI saw
that there was no structural damage. It was a relief after I
found that out.


"The way to solve the problem is getting rest, icing, and just
giving it a little break. I will be here working so I can get
back on the court as soon as possible."


Washington's third-leading scorer, the Butler is averaging career
highs of 19.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.1 steals
this season. Jordan revealed that swingman Jarvis Hayes will
start during Butler's absence.


Washington own a one-half game lead over the defending NBA
champion Miami Heat for first place in the Southeast Division.
