US authorities have charged a man who jumped the White House
fence Friday, sparking a three-hour crackdown, with unlawful
entry and making a bomb threat, a security official said.


Catalino Diaz, a 66-year-old Florida man with no fixed address,
faces charges of "unlawful entry, threatening with a bomb, and
throwing a missile," said Kim Bruce, a spokeswoman for the US
Secret Service charged with US President George W. Bush's safety.


Bruce said she did not yet know how Diaz had delivered the
threat.


While he was quickly taken into custody, concerns about the bag
froze pedestrian traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the
mansion until 2:29 pm (1829 GMT), when the package was dealt with
and the all-clear was given, she said.


Fence jumpers are relatively common at the White House, and the
"missile" charge refers to Diaz throwing his bag into the
compound, a US official said.
