Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist thinks New Zealand could
be a major threat at the World Cup.


Gilchrist names the Black Caps as a potential danger, but
realises the competition is wide open.


"One-day cricket can often be a little bit of a lottery," he told
Sport magazine.


"If they remain at full strength, New Zealand will become a very
difficult team to play."
