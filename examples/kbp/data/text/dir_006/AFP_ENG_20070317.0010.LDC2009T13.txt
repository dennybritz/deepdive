World champion diver Alexandre Despatie said Saturday he has
fully recovered from a serious neck injury that kept him out of
action for a year.


The Canadian reigning 1m and 3m springboard world champion
reported a clean bill of health after training at the Melbourne
Sports and Aquatic Centre in preparation for the World Swimming
Championships here.


Despatie competed in the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne,
where he picked up three gold medals, but was forced to sit out
the rest of the year after being diagnosed with the injury in
May.


"I'm happy with how I'm doing, my neck is going well, I'm taking
care of it. The treatment is going right and there's no pain,"
Despatie said.


"This is my first international competition outside of the
Commonwealth Games, and having not competed for almost a year, it
felt like I didn't belong here, but I'm feeling really
comfortable."


Despatie shot to prominence after winning the gold medal in the
10m platform event at the 1998 Commonwealth Games as a 13-year-
old. He has become such a celebrity in his home country that he
shot his first movie last year.
