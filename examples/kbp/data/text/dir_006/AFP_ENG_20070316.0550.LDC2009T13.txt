Toulouse and France flyhalf Frederic Michalak made his long-
awaited return to the field on Friday during his Top 14 side's
friendly match against Biarritz.


Michalak spent a frustrating four months on the sidelines with a
torn ligament in his right knee.


However the 24-year-old was operated on in mid-November and
participated in his first training session with his Toulouse
team-mates just two weeks ago.


Toulouse coach Guy Noves played it safe bringing the stand-off on
for the last fifteen minutes of the game.


But within five minutes of coming on, Michalak showed he hadn't
lost any of his ball-handling skills to set up Gaffie Du Toit for
a try.


The 2007 Rugby World Cup could now be a possibility - albeit slim
- for the 24 -year-old Michalak, having previously been assured
by France coaching staff he would be considered for selection
despite his injury.
