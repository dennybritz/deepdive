Argentine President Nestor Kirchner said Friday authorities were
still probing the bombing of Israel's embassy that killed 22
people and injured 200 others 15 years after the attack.


Kirchner, speaking in Puerto Madryn in southeastern Argentina on
the eve of the bombing's 15th anniversary, also expressed his
"solidarity with the Jewish community for this horrible attack."


"Fifteen years ago, Argentina was rocked by an attack on the
embassy of Israel but which was also against all Argentines," he
said.


"There is permanent work to find the truth that many have tried
to hide for many years," Kirchner added.


Israeli diplomats and Argentina's Jewish community marked the
attack's anniversary Friday at a cement square built on the
embassy's ruins in downtown Buenos Aires.


Israel has pointed the finger at Iran for the March 17, 1992
attack, but no one has ever been detained or charged in the case.


Authorities have also yet to convict anyone for the 1994 bombing
of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association that left 85 dead and
300 injured.


Argentina has the largest Jewish community in South American with
about 300,000 people.
