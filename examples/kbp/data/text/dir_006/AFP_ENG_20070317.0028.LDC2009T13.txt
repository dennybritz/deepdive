Two separate bomb blasts on Saturday killed two policemen and
wounded four others plus a civilian in war-torn Iraq, police
said.


A policeman from a special task force was killed and two were
wounded when a roadside bomb exploded in the mainly Shiite
provincial capital of Hilla, south of Baghdad, police Lieutenant
Kadhim al-Aaraji said. A civilian was also wounded.


Aaraji said the bombers targeted Brigadier General Abbas al-
Juburi, commander of the task force, as his convoy was passing in
Hilla's southern district of Ndir. The brigadier escaped the
attack.


A similar blast targeting another police patrol in the main
northern city of Mosul killed one policeman and wounded another,
said police Brigadier General Abdel Karim Khalaf al-Juburi.


Iraqi forces come under constant attack from insurgents
attempting to undermine the country's embattled security and
political situation.
