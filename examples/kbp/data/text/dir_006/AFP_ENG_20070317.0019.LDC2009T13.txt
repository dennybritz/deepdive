Six people were found alive after they were missing for more than
two weeks in eastern Indonesian waters, an official said
Saturday.


"(Friday) night Doctor Juliana Carolus and friends, who were
missing since February 28, were found alive," ministry of health
official Rustam Pakaya told AFP.


Carolus, head of the health office in the Tanimbar isles, with
five of her staff, left on a speedboat on February 27 from the
town of Saumlaki, in Maluku province, on the way to Kormomolin,
about two hours away by speedboat.


Good weather was reported when they left, with no strong winds
and calm seas. It is not clear what caused their boat to go off
course.


The health officials left Saumlaki to deliver medicine, milk and
baby food.


They were reported to have survived the 18-day ordeal "on baby
food and rain water," provincial secretary Said Assegaf said on
ElShinta radio.


However, an ambulance was standing by to take the six people to a
hospital for a health check-up.


Assegaf, along with the governor of Maluku and other officials,
welcomed the survivors, who arrived at Ambon airport Saturday
morning. They were not immediately available to talk to
reporters.


The group was reported to have been found by fishermen, floating
near the border with Papua New Guinea. They are all reported as
being well.
