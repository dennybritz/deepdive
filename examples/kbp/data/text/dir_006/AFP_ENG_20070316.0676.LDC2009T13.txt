Singapore and France have agreed jointly to provide technical
help in areas such as education to Southeast Asian nations, the
city-state's foreign affairs ministry said.


The two countries have signed a letter of intent to formalise the
Third Country Training Programme, it said in a statement late
Friday.


"The Third Country Training Programme institutionalises
cooperation between Singapore and France," the foreign affairs
ministry said.


"It also facilitates closer collaboration in various human
resource capacity building programmes for Southeast Asian
countries in fields such as governance, health and higher
education."


The two countries have worked together to provide technical
assistance to Southeast Asian countries on an ad hoc basis since
2001.
