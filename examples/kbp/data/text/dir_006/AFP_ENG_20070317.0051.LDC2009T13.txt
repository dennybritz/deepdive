Five people were killed and 52 injured Saturday when a passenger
plane made an emergency landing in Samara, 1,100 kilometers east
of Moscow, officials told Russian media.


"The plane made a harsh landing. As a result the plane's fuselage
broke apart. Five people were killed from the crash and 51 people
received various injuries," RIA Novosti quoted an emergency
situations ministry spokesperson as saying.


The plane, a Tupolev Tu-134 operated by local airline YUT-Air,
had 50 passengers and seven crew members aboard, ministry
spokeswoman Irina Adrianova told state television channel
Vesti-24.


The injured passengers were taken from the site of the crash at
Samara airport to a local hospital, Adrianova said.


The twin-engine plane was en route from the Russian city of
Surgut, 2,200 kilometers (1,400 miles) east of Moscow.


The crash came three days after a Boeing 737 carrying 143
passengers made an emergency landing in Moscow after experiencing
problems in one of its two engines. No one was injured in the
incident.


Russia suffered its worst-ever year for air safety in 2006, with
33 accidents leaving 318 dead -- a six-fold increase over 2005 --
according to a report by the Interstate Aviation Committee, a
joint group involving former Soviet states.


The report blamed human error for 70 percent of Russia's air
accidents over the past five years.
