Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo met Friday with government
and rebel military leaders to discuss reunification of the armies
following a peace agreement signed earlier this month.


The agreement signed in neighboring Burkina Faso calls for a
transitional government to be in place by mid-April, with long-
delayed elections to follow.


A 2002 abortive coup against Gbagbo triggered a brief civil war
and divided the country into two zones, with the rebels
controlling the north.


"I came to affirm the determination of (the rebel army) to commit
to the implementation of the Ouagadougou agreement," rebel army
leader Soumaila Bakayoko said after the meeting. Ouagadougou is
the Burkina Faso capital.


The two military leaders also plan to meet Saturday in Bouake
with Guillaume Soro, head of the New Forces rebel group.


Officials also announced Friday that a team from the
International Monetary Fund will visit the country between March
29 and April 5 to develop post-crisis plans.


Paul Bohoun Bouabre, Ivory Coast planning minister, said
structural reforms in the coffee and cocoa sectors are needed.
Payments to the World Bank and African Development Bank will also
be addressed.


A second visit to the Ivory Coast involving the IMF and the World
Bank will follow in May, he said.


That mission will "finalise the discussions and proceed to the
signing of the post-crisis program," the minister said.
