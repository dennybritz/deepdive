Leeds hung on to win 32-26 at Wakefield to earn a valuable Super
League victory on Friday night in this top-of-the-table clash.


However the victory margin was much closer than had been expected
after the first half hour when Leeds were 24-0 ahead having
touched down four tries at Belle Vue.


Trinity's ill discipline had cost them dear in a fractious first
half during which they conceded 12 penalties and lost two men to
the sin bin.


But Ben Jeffries' try on the stroke of half-time gave them fresh
hope and after the break they played like a side transformed.


John Kear's men, who had won four of their previous five matches,
ran in three tries in a little over 10 minutes to reduce the
deficit to just four points.


At 20-24, Wakefield sensed a classic comeback but Ryan Bailey's
late try finally put Leeds home and dry.


That ensured Ryan Atkins' late touchdown - his second of the game
- was little more than consolation for the spirited Wildcats.


But Wakefield are clearly commanding respect under the astute
guidance of the wily Kear, who saved them from relegation last
season and has turned them into a forced to be reckoned with.


In the night's other fixture, Wigan won 25-6 at lowly Salford to
leave them in sixth position in the table.
