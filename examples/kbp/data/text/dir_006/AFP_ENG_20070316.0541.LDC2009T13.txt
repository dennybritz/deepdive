More than a thousand Afghan cultural artefacts returned to their
native soil on Friday after nearly a decade in a Swiss museum,
the Swiss foreign affairs ministry said.


Some 1,300 ethnographic and archeological objects were flown to
Kabul in a German airforce transporter and will subsequently be
restored to the Afghan National Museum.


The items were held by the Afghan Museum in Exile in Bubendorf,
near the Swiss city of Basel, since 1999.


The restoration "gives back to Afghanistan a piece of its memory.
The country needs this to rebuild its identity," said Koichiro
Matsuura, director general of the United Nations cultural agency
UNESCO.


The National Museum was pillaged and deliberately sacked during
the Taliban era. The extremist regime regarded any non-Islamic
art as idolatry, and sparked worldwide condemnation by its
demolition of ancient giant Buddha statues in 2001.
