French rugby union side Narbonne announced on Friday the signing
of South African Pieter Loots in a three-month deal.


Back row Loots makes the move from South African side The Border
Bulldogs and will reinforce the rear of the scrum after the ranks
were depleted with the departure of Christian Labit for English
side Northampton.


The 31-year-old Loots will make his debut for Narbonne, who are
in 11th position in the league, against Agen on April 7.
