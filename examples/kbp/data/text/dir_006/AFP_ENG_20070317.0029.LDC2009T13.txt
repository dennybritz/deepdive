Taiwan's foreign ministry has criticised a Nazi political
movement for distorting and hurting the island's international
image.


The National Socialism Association was set up by university
students who said they were inspired by Adolf Hitler and
dissatisfied with persistent political squabbling, according to
local media reports.


The group has raised eyebrows here while the foreign ministry
blamed it for giving the international community "a skewed
picture" of Taiwan.


"This ministry hopes that freedom of speech in Taiwan does not
come at the expense of tarnishing our good name as a guardian of
freedom and human rights," it said in a statement late Friday.


"Clearly, advocating Hitler and Nazism it both wrong and harmful
for Taiwan's international image," it said.


Israel's de facto ambassador to Taipei Raphael Gamzou earlier
this week expressed concern over the group.


The group on Saturday claimed more than 1,400 members with
offices in Taipei and the central city of Taichung, according to
its website.


Members were planning to rally in Taichung Saturday reportedly to
advocate Nazism and pay tribute to Hitler but the event was
cancelled with no reason given.


Taiwan's leading opposition Kuomintang in 2004 drew protests from
the island's Jewish community when it used a picture of Hitler in
an election advertisement criticising President Chen Shui-bian.


The party later apologised and replaced the advert with a
Buddhist figure.
