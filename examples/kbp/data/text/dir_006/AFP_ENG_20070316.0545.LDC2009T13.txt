AIDS is to blame for last year's sharp rise in cases of
tuberculosis in the Ivory Coast, health authorities said Friday
at the launch of a new programme to combat the pulmonary disease.


According to the latest figures, 21,204 cases of tuberculosis
were detected in 2006, representing an increase on the 2002
figure of 16,031, and were linked to the country's high level of
AIDS infection, currently running at 4.7 percent.


"Tuberculosis is the first infection to capitalise on AIDS," said
Jacquemin Kouakou, director of the National Programme for
Fighting Tuberculosis.


"One tuberculosis sufferer in two is co-infected with the HIV
virus", which can lead to the AIDS disease.


The Ivory Coast recorded 393 cases of tuberculosis for every
100,000 inhabitants, while the medium across the African sub-
Sahara was 290, Kouakou said.


Health officials were speaking on Friday at the announcement of
tougher measures to fight the spread of the disease, including
increasing the number of screening centres from 86 to 110 over
three years.


The goal is earlier detection, with one microscope per 100,000
inhabitants to comply with World Health Organization standards,
said Kouakou, adding that currently the figure is 250,000.
