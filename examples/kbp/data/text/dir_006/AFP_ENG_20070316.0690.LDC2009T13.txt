An Islamic militant who escaped from police in 2003 was re-
captured in the southern Philippines, a police spokesman said on
Saturday.


Merang Abante, a member of the Muslim militant Abu Sayyaf group,
was arrested in Isabela City in the island of Basilan on Friday
and taken to the city of Zamboanga for questioning, said Chief
Superintendent Joel Goltiao.


Abante has two arrest warrants for alleged involvement in Abu
Sayyaf kidnapping schemes, Goltiao said although he did not give
details.


The suspect was arrested before but escaped along with other Abu
Sayyaf members in 2003.


The Abu Sayyaf, which has been linked by security experts to the
al-Qaeda terror network, has been blamed for the worst terror
attacks in the Philippines including mass kidnappings of
Christians and foreigners.


The Philippines earlier this month enacted an anti-terrorism law
that the government said would boost the campaign against Muslim
militants such as the Abu Sayyaf and its regional ally, the
Jemaah Islamiyah.
