Afghan authorities Saturday launched an investigation into the
killing of five police officers during an ambush by Taliban
insurgents.


The policemen were killed in southern Helmand province Friday and
an Afghan official initially said they died when coalition forces
opened fire following a Taliban ambush but later he said the
policemen were killed by the insurgents.


Foreign troops deny involvement in the incident.


The authorities were investigating how the policemen were killed,
Afghan interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP.


"The actual story is that the Afghan police were ambushed by
Taliban and police returned fire. Meanwhile, (US-led) coalition
troops believing it (was) the enemy also sent fire," Bashary
said.


The "policemen were caught in a crossfire," between Taliban
insurgents and the foreign coalition troops.


"At this point we don't know if they were killed by Taliban fire
or the coalition fire. This is what we're investigating at this
point," the spokesman said.


But coalition forces, which have troops in the area, said they
were not involved.


"Our position has not changed. There's no involvement of the
coalition in this incident," a spokesman said, referring to an
earlier comment by coalition officials denying any involvement.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force has also
ruled out the involvement of its troops in the killing.


The ISAF, which has about 37,000 troops from 37 countries, is
here to stabilise the country, including by ridding areas of
insurgents, to allow for development work.


The coalition, which numbers about 14,000, is focused on counter
terrorism.
