Three scuba divers died Friday while diving on a popular
shipwreck off south Florida, and police were still trying to
retrieve two of the bodies stuck inside the sunken 155-meter
vessel, police said.


A fourth diver who had remained outside ascended safely as he
began running out of air, and alerted another team of divers that
his buddies had failed to return from their penetration of the
Spiegel Grove wreck.


The search party eventually returned with one of the divers, "who
was in distress," the Monroe County Sheriff's department said.
The rescued diver was pronounced dead upon arrival at the
Mariners Hospital in the Florida Keys.


"The two other divers did not surface and initial searches of the
area failed to locate them," the Sheriff's department said saying
renewed attempts to retrieve the bodies would be made on
Saturday.


"According to detectives, the bodies are so deep inside, it will
be extremely difficult to recover them."


The Spiegel Grove, which is located 10 kilometers (nine miles)
off Key Largo is a popular destination with scuba divers.


Because it sits on the ocean floor at a depth of 40 meters (135
feet) it is considered an advanced dive.


Shipwreck penetration is considered one of the most dangerous
aspects of the sport because it involves a confined environment
where a diver can get entangled and from which it is not possible
to surface directly if in distress.
