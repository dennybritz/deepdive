Jakarta's governor has given a two-week deadline for door-to-door
checks to be completed to enforce a ban on domestic poultry,
reports said Saturday.


The ban was introduced last month to tackle bird flu, which has
killed eight people so far this year in Indonesia, but was
hampered by major floods in the Indonesian capital.


"I give two weeks to the mayors to raid residents' poultry,"
governor Sutiyoso said in his office after carrying out a raid,
as reported by Media Indonesia daily.


He added that poor knowledge about bird flu meant people were
unaware of the danger of keeping poultry in residential areas.


"We will continue to educate the people but if they are still
caught keeping them, we have to cull their poultry," said
Sutiyoso.


Major floods hit Jakarta on February 2, the day after the ban was
put into effect, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee
their homes.


Indonesia has suffered the highest human death toll from bird
flu, with 65 fatalities since June 2005. Six of the eight deaths
this year have been in Jakarta and surrounding areas.


Health and municipal officials started to search backyards in
January after Sutiyoso announced that no birds other than
licensed pets would be allowed in residential areas of the city
from February.


Animal husbandry officials said at the beginning of February that
more than 100,000 birds had been slaughtered, but it is estimated
there are more than one million poultry still in Jakarta.
