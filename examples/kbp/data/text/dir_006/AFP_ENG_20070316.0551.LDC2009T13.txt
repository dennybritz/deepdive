The major US share indexes ended lower Friday after a stronger-
than-expected snapshot on inflation renewed economic concerns
days before the US Federal Reserve meets to mull US interest
rates.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 49.11 points (0.40
percent) at 12,110.57 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite finished 6.04 points (0.25 percent) lower at
2,372.66 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 lost 5.38
points (0.39 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,386.90.


Lingering concerns about the health of the country's vast
mortgage market also continued to overshadow the market, traders
said.


Analysts said the latest inflation reading would likely cement a
decision next week by the Fed to keep US interest rates on hold
at 5.25 percent. The Fed, which has cited inflation as one of its
key concerns, meets Tuesday and Wednesday to mull US rates.


The Labor Department said Friday that US consumer prices rose 0.4
percent in February, stronger than the 0.3 percent rise widely
expected by Wall Street.
