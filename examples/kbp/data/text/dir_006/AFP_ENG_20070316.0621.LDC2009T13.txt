The Colorado Rockies will launch their 2007 Major League Baseball
campaign without their manager and lefthanded pitcher Jeff
Francis.


Manager Clint Hurdle and Francis were suspended on Friday for an
incident in a pre-season game against San Diego three days
earlier.


In the fifth inning, Francis intentionally threw at San Diego's
Kevin Kouzmanoff after a warning already had been issued to both
teams.


Both Hurdle and Francis were ejected from the game immediately
following the incident.


Hurdle, who is entering his sixth season at the helm in Colorado,
was suspended one regular-season game and was fined an
undisclosed amount while Francis received a five-game suspension
and an undisclosed fine.


Unless he appeals the ruling, Francis will begin serving the
suspension on April 3.
