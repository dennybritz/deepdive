The Blackstone Group, the US investment fund which specializes in
taking publicly listed companies private, is mulling a partial
stock market flotation, according to media reports Friday.


The Wall Street Journal's online edition reported that
Blackstone, which has mounted several mega buyouts in recent
months, could be close to seeking a stock market listing for
about 10 percent of the New York-based firm.


A separate report by the CNBC business television channel said
the Goldman Sachs investment bank was helping Blackstone put its
potential share offering together.


Such a move, if it occurs, would be somewhat ironic for a firm
that has made a name for itself by taking large companies private
and seeking to improve their earnings.


Blackstone was founded with 400,000 dollars in 1985 by Peter
Peterson, a former White House aide and ex-chief executive of
Lehman Brothers, and Stephen Schwarzman, a former Lehman Brothers
mergers and acquisitions specialist.


Since then, it has mushroomed into a global firm and raised over
64 billion dollars in investments, a hefty chunk of which have
targeted private equity deals, according to Blackstone's website.


One of its most recent deals saw Blackstone win a 39-billion-
dollar bid to take over the largest US office management firm,
Equity Office Properties Trust (EOPT), in February.


The EOPT deal marked the most costly US private equity
transaction ever.
