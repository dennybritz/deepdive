Four teenagers were charged Friday night with the murder of a 16
-year-old schoolboy who was stabbed to death following a chase in
the British capital London, police said.


The four -- two aged 13, one aged 15 and a fourth aged 16 -- were
to appear at West London magistrates' court on Saturday on
charges of murdering Kodjo Yenga, a black student at St Charles
Catholic Sixth Form College.


A post mortem examination found that he died from a single stab
wound to the heart following the attack late Wednesday in
Hammersmith Grove, west London.


An area resident Minaxi Patel, who works in a convenience store
on the street, said she saw a boy chased by a group of boys and
several girls who were shouting "kill him, kill him."


Police said Thursday they detained a total of seven young males
for questioning, all black and aged between 13 and 21.


Last month a wave of gang-linked gun crime left four people dead
-- three of them teenagers -- in London.
