Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai left on Saturday for an
official three-day visit to Germany and France, his office said
in a statement.


Karzai is to receive recognition -- the "Riser Award" -- in the
German city of Bochum for his outstanding leadership, the
statement said.


He would hold talks Monday with Chancellor Angela Merkel on
Germany's role in Afghanistan, including its mission within the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), in which Germany
has nearly 3,000 troops, it added.


Karzai would also travel to France, where he would meet his
French counterpart Jacques Chirac, the statement said, without
giving details.


France has 1,100 troops in the ISAF.
