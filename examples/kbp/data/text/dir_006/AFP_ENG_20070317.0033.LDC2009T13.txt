The Indonesian government has guaranteed a monorail project in
the capital Jakarta, allowing plans to issue a 650 million dollar
Islamic bond in the Middle East to go ahead, reports said
Saturday.


"We finally receive news (from the ministry of finance) that a
guarantee letter has been signed by the minister," Jakarta
governor Sutiyoso said, quoted by Media Indonesia daily.


Sutiyoso said he hoped PT Jakarta Monorail and the Dubai Islamic
Bank could start funding continuing construction work this year.


The 27 kilometre (17 mile) monorail project was started in June
2004 by then- president Megawati Sukarnoputri, but work has since
been hampered by a lack of money and wranglings over what
technology to use.


Two lines will serve Jakarta's business districts and outer
areas.


Unlike most other major Asian cities, traffic-clogged Jakarta has
no subway or light railway system.
