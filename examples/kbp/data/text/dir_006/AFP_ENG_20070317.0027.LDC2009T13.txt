Military-run Myanmar arrested 328 suspected drug dealers and
seized 73 kilograms (160 pounds) of opium in February in an
effort to crack down on rampant drug trafficking, state media
said Saturday.


Citing police figures, the state-run New Light of Myanmar
newspaper said police also seized 15 kilograms of heroin.


Myanmar regularly burns hauls of narcotics in a bid to convince
the world that it is cracking down on drug production, but the
Southeast Asian country remains the world's second-largest opium
producer after Afghanistan.


The United States, a vocal critic of the junta, has said soaring
amphetamine production in Myanmar is one of the most serious
problems facing the region.
