Government troops and Tiger rebels traded artillery attacks in
northern Sri Lanka Saturday as the overnight toll rose to at
least six soldiers and a rebel killed, officials said.


Security forces lost five soldiers and 23 were wounded in the
district of Vavuniya, while another soldier was killed further
north in the Jaffna peninsula, military officials said.


Security forces tried to advance towards Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) positions in the Vavuniya district, but were
beaten back by heavy mortar fire from the guerrillas, the Tigers
said.


Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said one of their fighters
was killed and several others wounded in a three-hour
confrontation on Friday.


He said the artillery exchanges were continuing on Saturday but
there were no fresh casualties reported.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
since December 2005 despite a truce that has been in place, at
least on paper, since February 2002.
