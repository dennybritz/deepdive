An elderly Muslim and his son were shot dead and a Buddhist man
was wounded in separate drive-by shootings in Thailand's restive
Muslim-majority south, police said Saturday.


The 59-year-old father and his 30-year-old son were shot several
times late Friday while riding a motorcycle in Ruso district of
Narathiwat province, one of three violence-torn provinces
bordering Malaysia, they said.


Ruso is one of districts in which the government was considering
expanding curfews, according to local reports, in the wake of
Wednesday's massacre of nine Buddhists by suspected Islamic
militants.


The military has already imposed a curfew in the districts of
Yaha and Banang Sata in Yala province, which suffered the brunt
of recent attacks, including the grisly daylight killings of nine
Buddhists and bombings.


In neighboring Pattani province, a 61-year-old Buddhist man was
shot and wounded Saturday after two militants opened fire on a
crowd of residents who were watching and listening to doves to be
chosen for a bird show.


Security forces also defused a five-kilogram (11-pound) roadside
bomb Saturday in Narathiwat.


The three Muslim-majority provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and
Yala were once an autonomous sultanate, until the region was
annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a century ago. Separatist
unrest has erupted periodically ever since.


The latest insurgency has killed some 2,000 people since January
2004.
