The White House has told US lawmakers eager to secure testimony
from aides to US President George W. Bush that it needs more time
to discuss the issue, a spokesman said Friday.


White House Counsel Fred Fielding told the House Judiciary
Committee that he hoped for a meeting on Tuesday to deliver the
Bush administration's answer on the issue, said Bush spokesman
Tony Fratto.


At issue is a mushrooming controversy over the late-2006 mass
firing of federal prosecutors. Critics have charged that they
were removed for political reasons. The Justice Department has
cited job performance.


Fielding said, "given the importance of the issues under
consideration and the presidential principles involved, we need
more time to resolve them," Fratto told AFP by telephone.


"Mister Fielding suggested to the committee that he get back
together with them on Tuesday," the spokesman said.
