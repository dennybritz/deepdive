Bulgaria's government said on Friday it will send an extra 335
troops to Afghanistan, of whom 200 will be stationed at Kandahar
in the restive south of the country.


The troops in Kandahar, part of a 35,000-strong NATO-led force,
will take over from Romanian troops from the end of June
protecting the interior of the city's airport.


Around 120 troops and 15 officers will leave for the Afghan
capital Kabul at the beginning of June where they will assist in
training the Afghan military.


Bulgaria, a member of the NATO military alliance since 2004,
currently has 82 troops in Afghanistan, all based in Kabul.


It also has 155 stationed in Iraq, where 13 Bulgarian soldiers
and six Bulgarian civilians have been killed since the US-led
invasion in 2003.
