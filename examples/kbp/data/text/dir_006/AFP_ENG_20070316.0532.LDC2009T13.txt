Saint Patrick's Day festivities are a foreign imposition that
should not be celebrated in Russia, an Orthodox church official
said Friday, as Moscow prepares to host a parade to mark the
holiday.


"It's a lay feast that has been imposed on us from abroad,"
Father Igor Vyzhanov, who is responsible for church relations at
the Moscow patriarch's office, was quoted by RIA Novosti news
agency as saying.


The feast "is being exported to Russia on an American scale,"
Vyzhanov said, adding: "The question of whether Russians should
celebrate it or not simply evokes disbelief."


Moscow city authorities are organising a "green" parade, the
colour traditionally associated with the Irish feast, on Sunday
on Novy Arbat, one of Moscow's main thoroughfares.


Saint Patrick, whose feast day has been celebrated since the
ninth century, is credited with converting Ireland to
Christianity and to have baptised thousands, ordained priests and
set up churches and monasteries.
