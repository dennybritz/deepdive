Polling stations opened Sunday in mainland France to elect a new
president, a day after overseas territories began casting
ballots.


Some 44.5 million voters can take part in the election pitting
the rightwing frontrunner Nicolas Sarkozy against Socialist
Segolene Royal, who wants to become France's first woman
president.


One million voters in French overseas departments and expatriates
began casting ballots on Saturday.


Polls opened at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) and are due to close at 8:00
pm (1800 GMT).


The election is to choose a successor to President Jacques Chirac
who is stepping down after 12 years in office and caps a campaign
that has put voters before a stark right-left choice for France's
future.


A first round of voting was held on April 22 marked by a near-
record turnout of 84 percent. Ten of the 12 candidates in that
election were eliminated, allowing Sarkozy and Royal to advance
to the runoff.
