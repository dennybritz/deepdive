A Zimbabwean court has ordered the release of two opposition
lawyers arrested in the capital last week after challenging a
ministerial certificate, defence lawyers said on Sunday.


The lawyers, Alec Muchadehama and partner Andrew Makoni, were
arrested late Friday after challenging the certificate issued by
Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi barring the courts from
granting bail to their clients.


"Justice (Tedias) Karwi ordered that they be released as he said
their arrest was unlawful," Advocate Eric Matinenga told AFP.


The lawyers were representing a member of parliament for the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and 12 other
activists accused of petrol bombing government properties and
other privately owned business.


Mohadi had issued the certificate saying the 13 activists should
remain in prison as they had gone to South Africa for military
training in South Africa and police were still investigating the
case.


However, Muchadehama and Makoni said in court papers the
ministerial certificate had been irregularly issued.


"The Certificate produced by the Minister is senseless, unlawful
and ineffectual," the lawyers said.


Lawrence Chibwe, secretary for the Law Society of Zimbabwe, said
the court order was issued late Saturday, but the two lawyers
were still detained.


"By last night the two lawyers were still in jail," Chibwe said.


"We do not know why, they are still behind bars, but we are
trying to have them released."
