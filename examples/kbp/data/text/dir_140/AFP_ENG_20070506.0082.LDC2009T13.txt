Four people have been killed after floods caused by the heaviest
rain in decades inundated Myanmar's largest city and submerged a
number of homes, state-run media and residents said Sunday.


The New Light of Myanmar newspaper said that four people in one
Yangon home suffocated in a fire after floods caused a short
circuit. Residents confirmed that the four family members had
died in the accident.


Another woman was injured when she stepped on a power line that
was downed by the extreme weather and was electrocuted, the paper
said.


Across the city, walls collapsed and trees toppled over in the
worst rain in decades, and "some houses in the townships were
submerged by the floods," the newspaper reported.


Yangon, the commercial capital of military-run Myanmar, was hit
by heavy rain from Thursday evening to Saturday morning, with the
paper reporting two to three feet (600 to 900 millimetres) of
water in some areas.


The semi-official Myanmar Times newspaper quoted a meteorology
department official blaming a tropical depression in the Bay of
Bengal for the heavy rain.


The paper said that a massive storm in Yangon that began late
last week brought 344 millimetres of rain to one district between
Friday and Saturday, the highest rainfall in 39 years.


Other townships also reported their highest levels of rainfall in
decades, but the meteorology department official said the
tropical depression that caused the storm was now on the move.


"It is moving northward but is not developing into a bigger
storm," she told the Myanmar Times.
