Barry Bonds belted his 744th career home run Saturday as he
continued his progress toward Hank Aaron's all-time record of
755.


Bonds' 10th homer of the season helped lift the Giants to a 9-4
victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in the third of a four-
game series.


The 42-year-old slugger now needs 12 home runs to surpass Aaron's
revered mark.


Pedro Feliz added a three-run blast in a four-run eighth inning -
after the Phillies opted to walk Bonds for the third time - for a
9-4 lead.


On Friday, Philadelphia elected to walk Bonds in both the seventh
and eighth innings and it led to a pair of three-run frames in a
6-2 win by San Francisco.


Bonds, who normally does not play in a day game following a night
contest, ripped a shot off Phillies starter Jon Lieber to lead
off the second inning to tie the score at 1-1.


The seven-time Most Valuable Player, who has 28 walks on the
season, moved into sole possession of fourth place all-time -
past Stan Musial - with his 1,952th RBI, and tied Babe Ruth and
Hank Aaron for third place all-time in runs scored with 2,174.


Eliezer Alfonzo also slugged a solo home run in the seventh for
San Francisco.


Bonds's heroics have been tainted by accusations of steroids
although he has said he never knowingly used steroids.


Bonds's trainer, Greg Anderson, was among five men convicted in
the BALCO steroid scandal, and for much of Bonds's career, Major
League Baseball did not test for performance-enhancing drugs.
