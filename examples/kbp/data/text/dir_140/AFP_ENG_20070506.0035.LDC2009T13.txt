A Muslim man was shot dead and his young son injured Sunday in an
attack by suspected separatist militants in Thailand's troubled
south, police said.


Gunmen broke into the villager's house in Narathiwat province
early Sunday morning, killing the 29-year-old as he slept, local
police said. The man's four- year-old son was also shot and
injured in the attack.


More than 2,100 people have been killed since January 2004 in the
southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani, where
militants are waging a bloody battle for an independent state
separate from Buddhist-majority Thailand.


The escalating violence in the Muslim-majority region bordering
Malaysia has also heightened sectarian tensions.


About 150 Muslim women and children on Sunday continued their
blockade of a highway in Yala province, where they have been
camped out for four days demanding the authorities release 21
suspected insurgents.


Their rally provoked a counter-demonstration on Saturday by
hundreds of Buddhists who called for the Muslims to disband, but
police said on Sunday that all the Buddhists had gone home.
