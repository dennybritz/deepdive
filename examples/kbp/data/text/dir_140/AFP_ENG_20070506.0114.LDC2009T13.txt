Afghanistan's Taliban said it would decide on the fate of a
French man and three Afghans after a new French government is
formed, following presidential elections under way Sunday.


Yousuf Ahmadi, a spokesman for the group, said Saturday the
decision would be made once the result of the election, which
closes at 1800 GMT, is known.


But on Sunday he told AFP: "The deadline has been extended until
the end of the election and formation of the new government.
We'll decide after that."


He could not give a time frame.
