Eight Filipinos and three South Koreans seized by armed men in
Nigeria's oil- rich southern region said in a telephone message
aired Sunday that they were being beaten up and deprived of food.


"We are in the forest, there is no tent, no shade, no food, no
water. For three days we are beaten up, I don't know what will
happen next," one of the Filipino hostages said in the message
aired on radio DZBB here.


The South Korean executives and Filipino labourers with Daewoo
Engineering and Construction were kidnapped Thursday following a
shootout at a power plant construction site in southern Nigeria.


Contact has been made with the gunmen but with little result so
far.


DZBB radio said it obtained the recording from a colleague of the
Filipinos who had recently returned home and whose mobile
telephone number the hostages called to air their appeal.


"Every single time, every single hour is important. They asked us
to call for help. Why? Because our management Daewoo is not doing
anything good to release us," the Filipino hostage said.


There were no names mentioned, although a heavily accented voice
could be heard in the background telling the hostage what to say.


The Philippines' Overseas Workers Welfare Administration has been
told of the tape but declined to give any comments until it hears
from negotiators on the ground.
