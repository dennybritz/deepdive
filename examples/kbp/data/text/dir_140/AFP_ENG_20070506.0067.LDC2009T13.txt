A landmine detonated by Tamil Tigers killed three police
commandos in eastern Sri Lanka on Sunday while seven suspected
rebels died elsewhere in the embattled region, military officials
said.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) attack blew up a
police Special Task Force vehicle in Batticaloa district also
wounding three officers.


Security forces shot five rebels in the north of the island early
Sunday while two more were killed in Batticaloa, said the
military.


The renewed violence came after the Sri Lankan navy said it
killed at least a dozen Tiger rebels in a battle off the
northeast coast on Friday night.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,800 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005.
