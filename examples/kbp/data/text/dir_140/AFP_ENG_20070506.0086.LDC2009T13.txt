A superjumbo Airbus A380 landed in New Delhi on Sunday in its
first flight to the country in a trip designed to raise the
profile of its only Indian customer.


The aircraft flew into the country to mark the second anniversary
of private domestic carrier Kingfisher Airlines, the only Indian
airline and among 16 airlines globally to have ordered the plane
from Europe's Airbus Industrie.


"The plane is here on a route-proving and airport compatibility
exercise," an Airbus spokesman said.


As part of a technical drill, the massive jet will fly select
passengers around New Delhi before heading off for the western
financial hub of Mumbai on Wednesday.


Kingfisher Airlines, owned by Indian distiller UB group, ordered
five A380s in 2005 among 15 planes in a deal worth about three
billion dollar.


It expects the first delivery of the aircraft in 2011 as it draws
up plans for an international debut, using the A380 -- which has
been much delayed in production -- on high-density routes such as
to the United States.


Air travel in India has soared in the past five years as almost a
dozen new airlines have been launched to serve demand in the
fast-expanding economy.
