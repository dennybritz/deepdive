Polling stations opened Sunday in mainland France to elect a new
president, a day after overseas territories began casting
ballots.


Some 44.5 million voters can take part in the election pitting
the rightwing frontrunner Nicolas Sarkozy against Socialist
Segolene Royal, who wants to become France's first woman
president.


One million voters in French overseas departments and expatriates
began casting ballots on Saturday.
