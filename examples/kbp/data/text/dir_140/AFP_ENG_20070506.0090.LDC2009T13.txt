Three people were killed when a small aircraft  of the
Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) mission crashed in
Egypt's northern Sinai region Sunday, a security official told
AFP.


"Three people died in the crash," the official said on condition
of anonymity.


Egypt's civil aviation ministry and the MFO confirmed the crash
but said they were still trying to establish the number of
casualties.


"Yes, unfortunately we have had reports of a plane crash. It was
a French aircraft carrying eight French crew members. There was
one other officer on board whose identity we are still trying to
get," the MFO director general's representative, Normand St.
Pierre, told AFP.


"It was a training mission and we lost touch with the plane
shortly after takeoff," he said.


The plane was heading from the northern Sinai airport of Al-Gurah
towards St. Catherine, further south.


There were no immediate details as to the cause the crash.


The Multinational Force and Observers is an independent
peacekeeping force not related to the United Nations, created as
a result of the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty and funded
mainly by the two neighbours and the United States.


The approximately 2,000-strong military force was set up in 1982
and includes troops from 11 different countries, including a
large US contingent. It is based in two camps in the Sinai.
