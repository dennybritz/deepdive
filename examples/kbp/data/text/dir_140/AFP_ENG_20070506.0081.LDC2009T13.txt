Three people were killed when a small aircraft  of the
Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) mission crashed on
takeoff in Egypt's northern Sinai region Sunday, a security
official told AFP.


"Three people died in the crash," the official said on condition
of anonymity.


The plane was going from the northern Sinai airport of Al-Gurah
and heading towards St. Catherine, further south.


The multinational forces supervise the security provisions of the
Egypt-Israel peace treaty.
