US authorities have launched investigations into suspicious
trading in Dow Jones & Co. before a bid for the company by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the Wall Street Journal reported on
Saturday.


Dow Jones received a subpoena from the New York state attorney
general's office and an inquiry from the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), a company spokesman told the newspaper.


"We will cooperate fully with the authorities investigating the
matter," an unnamed spokesman for Dow Jones was quoted as saying.


An official with News Corp. confirmed the company had received a
subpoena from the attorney general and the SEC, saying the
company was ready to cooperate "fully."


The investigations come after news of Murdoch's five-billion-
dollar bid for Dow Jones emerged last week, two weeks after the
Dow Jones board received his unsolicited offer.


Trading in Dow Jones options increased markedly in late April,
with more than 10,000 call options on the stock traded compared
with 7,000 over the whole first quarter, the paper reported.


Some options traders made big profits as Dow Jones shares
rocketed over 57 percent to around 57.28 dollars a share in the
wake of the report of Murdoch's bid.


The board of directors for Dow Jones announced earlier in the
week that it will take no action on the surprise offer.
Controlling shares belong to the Bancroft family, and a
representative has told the board the family opposes the bid.


The Wall Street Journal is the prize asset of Dow Jones and the
most prominent daily business publication in the United States.
