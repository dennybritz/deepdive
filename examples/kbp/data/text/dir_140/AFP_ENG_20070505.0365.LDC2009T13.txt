Street Sense, ridden by Calvin Borel and trained by Carl Nafzger,
won the Kentucky Derby here on Saturday, capturing the first leg
of US flat racing's Triple Crown.


Street Sense overtook Hard Spun in the final straight to win the
133rd running of the 1 1/4-mile race, which was attended by
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.


Rallying from far back, Street Sense became the first colt to win
the Kentucky Derby after winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. He
also became the first 2-year- old champion from the previous
season to win the race since Spectacular Bid in 1979.


Hard Spun held on for second, followed by Curlin.


The victory put trainer Carl Nafzger back in the winner's circle
at Churchill Downs. Nafzger trained Ubridled, who won the Run for
the Roses in 1990.


Trainer Todd Pletcher, who saddled five starters in his bid to
finally break through for his first Triple Crown race victory,
instead fell to 0-15 in the Kentucky Derby.


The pretigious trio of races continues with the Preakness Stakes
in Maryland and concludes with the Belmont Stakes in New York.
