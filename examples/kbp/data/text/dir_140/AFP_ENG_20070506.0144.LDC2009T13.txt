Cape Town mayor Helen Zille was elected the new leader of South
Africa's main opposition Democratic Alliance at a party congress
in Midrand near Johannesburg on Sunday.


Zille saw off a challenge from the party's national chairman Joe
Seremane and DA Eastern Cape leader Athol Trollip.


She is to take over the reigns of the liberalist party from
retiring veteran Tony Leon.


Zille has been at the helm of Cape Town for the past year -- the
only major South African municipality not governed by the
nationally ruling African National Congress.
