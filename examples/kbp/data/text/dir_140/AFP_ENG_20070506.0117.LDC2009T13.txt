A powerful explosion rocked a police centre in a northwestern
Pakistani city Sunday, causing damage to the building but no
casualties, police said.


The apparently accidental blast was caused by some grenades
stored in a room of the armoury at the Kohat police centre in
North West Frontier Province, city police chief Akhtar Nawaz told
AFP.


The room was locked, he said adding that it belonged to a police
officer who had been out of the city for the past several weeks
on a training mission.


"We have launched an investigation and are also contacting the
police officer to know details of the ordnance he had stored in
his room," Nawaz said.


"The blast seems to be accidental, it was not a terrorist
attack," he said, adding that the room caved in but there were no
casualties.


North West Frontier Province has suffered years of violence in
its semi- autonomous tribal areas, where Pakistani forces are
battling Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants who sneaked into the
country after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.


A suicide bombing in northwestern Charsadda town late last month
killed 29 people and wounded Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao.
