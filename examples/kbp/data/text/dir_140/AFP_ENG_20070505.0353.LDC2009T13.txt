A 50-year-old female spectator was killed during the Rally of
Argentina on Saturday when an amateur driver hit a group of three
people, race organisers announced.


Argentina's Gonzalo Alenaz lost control of his Subaru as he was
approaching the start of the 11km 14th special stage between
Cosquin and Tanti.


The fatal accident left a 30-year-old man with an injured
shoulder and a 25 -year-old woman with an injured ankle.


Thousands of spectators had been watching the race during
Saturday's second day when France's reigning three-time world
champion Sebastien Loeb led the pack.


Loeb's Citroen was 19 seconds ahead of the Ford Focus of
Finland's Marcus Gronholm and 1min 25sec in front of Finland's
Mikko Hirvonen in another Ford Focus at the end of the day.
