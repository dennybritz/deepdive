A 40-point second half Sunday propelled Manly Sea Eagles back to
the top of Australia's National Rugby League with Melbourne
Storm.


The Sea Eagles, trailing 6-12 at halftime, put on the after-
burners to scorch the Canberra Raiders 46-30 in the national
capital.


Manly grabbed a share of the competition lead after eight rounds
after Melbourne crashed to their first defeat of the season 30-12
away to the Wests Tigers on Saturday.


The Sea Eagles started slowly against the Raiders but five tries
in 18 minutes put paid to Canberra with Manly winger Michael
Robertson grabbing a hattrick against his former club.


Canterbury Bulldogs put their NRL campaign back on track with a
comfortable 30-16 victory over an injury-depleted Newcastle at
Sydney's Olympic stadium.


Labelled "brain dead" by their coach Steve Folkes after last
week's upset loss to the Wests Tigers, the Bulldogs hit back with
a five tries to two victory to claim their fourth win of the
season to keep pace with the top eight.


Bulldogs fullback Luke Patten scored two tries while winger Hazem
El Masri crossed for a try and had five conversions to take his
career points tally to 1910 -- becoming just the sixth player in
Australian rugby league history to pass 1900 points.
