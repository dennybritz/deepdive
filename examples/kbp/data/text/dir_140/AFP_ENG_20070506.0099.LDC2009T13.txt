Australia's Casey Stoner powered his ultra-fast Ducati to victory
in the Grand Prix of China here Sunday, in a hotly contested duel
against seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi.


Stoner swept around the 5.3-kilometre Shanghai circuit in 44mins
12.891secs, with Italy's Rossi on a Yamaha 3.036 seconds off the
pace and American John Hopkins on a Suzuki finishing third for
first ever podium.


Stoner, winner here in the 250cc class two years ago, started
from fourth but took the lead in the first lap setting the stage
for a nail-biting battle between the Italian master and the
impressive rider from Kuri-Kuri.


Under hazy sunshine the two dueled from the opening seconds of
the race with Rossi squeezing past on the corners only for Stoner
and his more powerful Ducati to roar past on Shanghai's long
straights.


But with seven laps remaining a late-braking Rossi overshot the
first corner, taking a trip through the grass that dropped him to
third behind Hopkins and sealing Stoner's victory.


Stoner and the legendary Italian motorcycle outfit have shown top
form early this season, pocketing two wins in three races prior
to Shanghai and many expected the 21-year-old to win the race
despite Rossi's record setting lap on Saturday.


The victory in Shanghai now gives Stoner 86 points in the
championships standings, Rossi is second with 71, and Spaniard
Dani Pedrosa on 41.
