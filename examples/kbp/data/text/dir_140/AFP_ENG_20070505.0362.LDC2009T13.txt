Spain's Supreme Court late on Saturday banned hundreds of
candidates from contesting upcoming local elections in the
northern Basque region on the grounds that their party was a
front for the outlawed separatist party Batasuna.


Batasuna has been banned since 2003 for its alleged links to the
armed separatist group ETA, whose 38-year-old campaign for an
independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern
France has claimed over 800 lives.
