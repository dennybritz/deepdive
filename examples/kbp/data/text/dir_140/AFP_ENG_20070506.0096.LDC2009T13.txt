A Yemeni court on Sunday sentenced two tribesmen to 12 years in
prison each for kidnapping four French tourists and holding them
hostage for two weeks last September.


Rajeh Mohammad Ahmed Hadi, 23, and Ahmed Haidara al-Aswad, 22,
were convicted of abducting the tourists in the town of Ataq in
Shabwa province southeast of the capital Sanaa.


The kidnappers, said to be from the al-Abdullah bin Daham tribe,
had demanded the release of relatives held by the authorities.
They previously briefly detained a German family and accused the
authorities of reneging on the agreement that paved the way for
their release.


The French tourists were freed on September 25, 2006.


Foreigners are frequently seized by Yemen's powerful tribes for
use as bargaining chips in disputes with the central government.
More than 200 have been abducted during the past 15 years.


All have been freed unharmed except for three Britons and an
Australian seized by Islamist militants in December 1998. They
were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers' hideout.
