Tiger Woods bogeyed the final hole Saturday to hand Rory
Sabbatini the third- round lead in the 6.4 million-dollar
Wachovia Championship.


South Africa's Sabbatini carded an 8-under-par 64, capped by a
birdie at 18, matching the Quail Hollow course record.


He had an 11-under total of 205, one better than Woods, who
carded a 68.


Fiji's Vijay Singh and American Arron Oberholser both carded 69s
to share third on 207.


Woods botched the par-4 18th, where he pushed his drive into the
right rough and hit his second shot left of the green.


Woods wasn't the only player to run into trouble at 18. Singh
bogeyed there when his long putt for par lipped out, and
Oberholser had a double-bogey.


Sabbatini's lead should come as no surprise. Just last month he
tied for second at The Masters.


"I just managed to keep the ball in play and the rain slowing the
greens up just a touch made it a little easier to be a little
aggressive with the putter," said Sabbatini, who eagled the first
hole and never looked back.


The start of play Saturday was delayed for two hours by nearby
thunderstorms, leaving the leaders in danger of not being able to
complete their rounds before darkness.


Woods and Singh played in the final pairing.
