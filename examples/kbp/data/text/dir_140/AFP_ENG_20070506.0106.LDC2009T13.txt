Malaysian authorities have proposed a multi-million dollar scheme
to regenerate a heavily logged forest in a bid to save its
orangutan population, a report said Sunday.


A fund of 200 million ringgit (59 million dollars) will be used
to replant trees to restore the Ulu Segama-Malua forest in
eastern Sabah state on Borneo island.


The most important objective will be the conservation of the
region's 3,000 orangutan population, Sam Mannan, a director with
the local forestry department, told the Sunday Star newspaper.


He said the Ulu Segama-Malua ecological zone was among Sabah's
"crown jewels" as it also contains a diverse array of plants.


The work will cover 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) of logged
forests as well as replanting 1,000 hectares of degraded forests.


Scientists recently claimed that Borneo island's orangutans were
under threat of extinction because of disappearing habitat.


A study completed in September of orangutans and other animals
along the Kinabatangan river, in central Sabah province, said the
apes could face extinction in less than 50 years unless immediate
conservation was undertaken.


Chunks of forest in Malaysia's Borneo, where orangutans live,
have been carved away by private land ownership, mainly
plantations, used to grow crops.
