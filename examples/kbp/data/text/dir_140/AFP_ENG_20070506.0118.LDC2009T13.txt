An Israeli armed guard was seriously injured on Sunday when
gunmen opened fire at a truck near the Palestinian town of
Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Israeli medical sources said.


The man, a civilian guard who was escorting the truck, was rushed
to a hospital inside Israel, a Magen David Adom medical services
spokesman told AFP.


Israeli soldiers were searching for the gunmen, the army said.
