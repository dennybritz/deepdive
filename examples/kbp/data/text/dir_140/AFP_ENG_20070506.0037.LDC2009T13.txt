North Korea's rulers are to import solar power from the West so
that its soldiers can watch television and use computers when in
barracks, a press report said Sunday.


The energy poor nation has acted after communist leader Kim Jong-
Il toured a military unit last year and found that power
shortages were stopping soldiers from watching programmes, the
major Japanese daily Mainichi reported.


Under Kim's instigation, Pyongyang's leadership ordered the
People's Army in around March to "install recreational facilities
at military units without fail," said the Mainichi quoting a
source close to the North Korean regime.


As a result, the authorities have decided to buy solar power
generation systems in large quantities from Western countries,
the daily said.


The decision will allow soldiers to "watch television for more
than five hours a day and use computers at military facilities,"
it added.


Kim's regime has favoured soldiers over other workers in deciding
who benefits from solar power.


The diehard communist state has been hit by dire energy and food
shortages in recent years with electric power stoppages witnessed
daily even in the capital city Pyongyang, according to foreign
residents and visitors.


In February, North Korea agreed in six-nation talks to dismantle
its nuclear arms programmes in exchange for energy assistance.
But the deal has been stalled by delays in ending a US-imposed
freeze on North Korean bank accounts.
