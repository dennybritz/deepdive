Taliban militants ambushed a police patrol in western
Afghanistan, killing eight policemen and losing at least four of
their own fighters, police said Sunday.


The fighting in the western province of Farah erupted late
Saturday after dozens of Taliban rebels ambushed a police unit
patrolling the troubled area, Farah police chief Sayed Agha Saqeb
said.


The fighting lasted six hours. "Eight police were killed and two
wounded," Saqeb said. About 17 rebels were believed killed and
wounded but only four bodies were recovered from the battlefield,
he said.
