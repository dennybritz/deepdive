Police searched the office of a Japanese amusement park operator
Sunday, the day after a roller coaster derailed there killing a
passenger and injuring 19 others.


A carriage in the six-car roller coaster jumped the rails and
smashed into a guardrail at noon on Saturday at the Expoland
amusement park in the western Japanese city of Osaka, police
said.


"We are investigating the case on suspicion of professional
negligence resulting in death," a spokesman for Suita police
station in Osaka told AFP by telephone.


"The second car which derailed had its wheel axel broken," he
added.


The Expoland operator had reportedly not replaced the axel of the
ill-fated car since it went into operation in 1992.


The accident was said to be the first fatality involving a roller
coaster in Japan.


Only two hours after the Expoland accident, three people were
slightly injured in a stalled car when it was bumped from behind
by another car on a ride in Fukui, by the Sea of Japan.


On April 28, a gust of wind stalled an ascending roller coaster
and sent it gliding back down a drop of 79 metres (260 feet) at a
park at the foot of Mount Fuji. No one was injured.


The government instructed local administrators on Saturday to
perform checks on some 1,000 roller coasters in operation across
Japan.
