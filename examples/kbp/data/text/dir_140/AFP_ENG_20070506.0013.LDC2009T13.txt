Floyd Mayweather remained undefeated by taking a 12-round split
decision over Oscar de la Hoya here Saturday to take the World
Boxing Council super- welterweight title in an epic showdown.


Two judges scored the fight for Mayweather by 116-112 and 115-113
while the third saw de la Hoya winning 115-113.


Mayweather, who became a champion in his fifth different weight
class, improved to 38-0. De la Hoya fell to 38-5.


On the Mexican Cinco de Mayo holiday, raucous loud cheers erupted
when Mexican- American hero de la Hoya entered the arena.
Mayweather made an appeal to the crowd by wearing a sombrero hat
as he entered the arena.


The same crowd that chanted "Oscar" in nearly every round jeered
the verdict.


The much-anticipated showdown between Mayweather, considered by
many the top pound-for-pound fighter, and de la Hoya, boxing's
most popular pay-per-view attraction, was expected to rank among
the highest revenue fights in history.


A sellout crowd of 16,700, with celebrities abundant at ringside,
produced a record live boxing payout of more than 19 million
dollars with pay-per-view totals expected to surpass 100 million
dollars.


De la Hoya, 34, made 25 million dollars, with his Golden Boy
Promotions set to receive half of a pay-per-view take from more
than one million homes, while "Pretty Boy Floyd" Mayweather, 30,
took home 10 million dollars.
