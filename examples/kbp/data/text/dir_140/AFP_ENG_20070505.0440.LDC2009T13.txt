Japanese electric power companies plan to establish eight plants
fueled by liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the next five years, a
move aimed at slashing carbon dioxide emissions, a report said
Sunday.


Of the projected LNG-burning power plants, four will be newly-
built and four will be converted from plants that currently use
coal or petrol as fuel, the leading business daily Nikkei
reported.


When they go into operation, it will slash carbon dioxide
emissions from thermal plants by eight percent, the report said.


Thermal power plants -- either coal, gas or oil -- account for
nearly 30 percent of all emissions of carbon dioxides and other
greenhouse gases in the country, the Nikkei said.


As LNG contains less carbon than other types of energy, an LNG
power plant emits 40-50 percent less carbon dioxide than a coal-
burning unit and 20-30 percent less than an oil-fired facility,
the report said.


In five years, only two of Japan's 10 electric power companies
will be without an LNG-burning power plant.


At present, nuclear power plants account for 30 percent of
overall power generation in Japan, followed by 26 percent by LNG
units, 24 percent by coal units, 10 percent by petrol units and
nine percent by hydroelectric plants.
