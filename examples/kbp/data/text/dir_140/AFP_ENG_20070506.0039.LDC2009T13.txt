Australian regulators Sunday blocked a private equity
consortium's multi-billion dollar takeover bid for Qantas
Airways.


The 11.1 billion dollar (9.2 billion US) bid by Airline Partners
Australia collapsed late on Friday after it failed to garner more
than 50 percent of shareholder acceptances by a 7:00 pm (0900
GMT) deadline.


But the hopes of the Macquarie Bank-led consortium were raised
hours later when a large American shareholder gave limited
backing to the deal, pushing acceptances to 50.6 percent.


But the country's Takeover Panel on Sunday refused to consider
accepting the late acceptances, effectively ending the bid.


"The Panel has decided not to commence proceedings in relation to
APA's application," it said in a statement.


APA said it would appeal the decision.
