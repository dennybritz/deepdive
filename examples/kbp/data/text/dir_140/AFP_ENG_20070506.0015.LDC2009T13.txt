Fifteen miners have died in a gas explosion in a northern China
coal mine, state media reported on Sunday, in the latest accident
to strike the country's notoriously dangerous coal mining
industry.


The explosion occurred Saturday afternoon, trapping 30 workers,
15 of which have now been confirmed dead, Xinhua news agency
reported, quoting rescuers at the scene.


Rescue efforts continued Sunday for the remaining 15 miners
trapped in the colliery in Shanxi province.


Local police are investigating two of the Pudeng Coal Mine's
managers, it said, adding no further details.


China's coal miners typically labour under appallingly conditions
as many miner owners cut corners on safety to maximise production
of the country's most important energy source.


More than 4,700 workers were killed last year, according to
official figures, but independent labour groups put the death
toll at up to 20,000 annually.
