Spain's Supreme Court on Saturday banned hundreds of candidates
from contesting upcoming local elections in the northern Basque
region on the grounds that their party was a front for the
outlawed separatist party Batasuna.


The court ruled that 246 supposedly apolitical "citizen lists,"
which bear the generic label "Abertzale Sozialistak," were
inspired by Batasuna and should not be allowed to take part in
the May 27 elections, as requested by Spain's public prosecutor.


But the court ruled that another seven lists of independents
which the prosecutor had also asked to be banned from taking part
in the poll would be allowed to stand.


Batasuna has been banned since 2003 for its alleged links to the
armed separatist group ETA, whose 38-year-old campaign for an
independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern
France has claimed over 800 lives.


It won 10 percent of the vote in regional elections in 2001 and
20 percent in 1999 municipal elections.
