Around 150 senior scholars and clerics from the world's major
religions will gather in Qatar on Monday for annual talks aimed
at further understanding and enhancing ties between their faiths.


The Fifth Doha Conference for Inter-Faith Dialogue will bring
together representatives of the major monotheistic religions --
Islam, Judaism and Christianity -- in the Gulf Arab state.


The creation of a permanent centre for inter-faith dialogue based
in Qatar is also expected to be announced at the two-day meeting.


During last year's conference, 13 rabbis were among the delegates
who debated topics such as the controversial publication of
cartoons in European newspapers depicting the Prophet Mohammed,
which enraged Muslims worldwide.


Gas-rich rich Qatar, a close US ally, has hosted an Israeli trade
mission since 1996 and visits by Israeli officials are relatively
frequent despite the two countries not having diplomatic
relations.
