Sri Lanka will be without some of its star players for the three-
match one-day series with Pakistan in Abu Dhabi later this month,
a senior official said here Sunday.


The 2007 World Cup runners-up team which will play matches with
Pakistan from May 18-22 in Abu Dhabi will be without Muttiah
Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas and Kumar Sangakkara, all key
players.


"The three boys will be going to England to play county cricket
and we have told the Abu Dhabi organisers that we will be sending
the best available team," K. Mathivanan, the secretary of Sri
Lanka Cricket, told AFP.


Muralitharan will turn out for Lancashire while Chaminda Vaas and
Kumar Sangakkara are to play for Middlesex and Warwickshire
respectively. "They will be leaving for England on May 10,"
Mathivanan said.


He said Sri Lankan cricket would have a brand new team of
selectors in place by next week. Picking the squad for Abu Dhabi
would be the last task for the outgoing panel.


Sri Lanka Cricket, which is the governing body of the sport in
Sri Lanka, will be recommending a set of names to Sports Minister
Gamini Lokuge next week for formal appointment to the national
selection panel.


There is speculation that former all-rounder Asantha De Mel will
be retained as the chairman of selectors.
