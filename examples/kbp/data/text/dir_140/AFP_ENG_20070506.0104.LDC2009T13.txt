Turkey's parliament went into a brief recess  Sunday after it
failed to obtain the required quorum to re-run a presidential
election, in which Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is the sole
candidate.


Parliament speaker Bulernt Arinc said after a roll call that "the
required number of members is not present."


He called a 10-minute recess after which he said he would hold a
second roll call and close the session if a quorum is still not
reached.


Turkey's Constitutional Court has ruled that the election
requires two-thirds of the parliament, or 367 legislators, to
participate in order to be valid.


Media reports said 359 members were present.


The first round of voting on April 27, in which Gul fell 10 votes
short of the 367 required to be elected, was cancelled last week
by the Constitutional Court on an interpretation of the quorum
rule.


Parliament then set a date for early general elections on July 22
and Gul said Sunday he would withdraw his candidacy if he is not
elected in this round.
