Insurgents attacked an Iraqi police station in Samarra north of
Baghdad on Sunday with a car bomb and small arms fire, killing
six members of the force, local police said.


A car bomb rammed the gates of the building and exploded, killing
local police chief Colonel Jalil al-Dulaimi and five of his men
and wounding eight others, said police Captain Ahmed Ali.


US soldiers at a nearby base responded to the attack, killing
several insurgents, and two soldiers sustained minor wounds,
according to an AFP correspondent in the camp.


Some half dozen seriously wounded Iraqi policemen were evacuated
by helicopter to a US medical facility.


The attack began with volleys of gunfire directed at the base at
9:00 am, followed 15 minutes later by the explosion of the
massive car bomb.


One US armoured Humvee that pursued the attackers was hit by a
rocket-propelled grenade, while a second reported being charged
by an insurgent wearing a suicide vest, who blew himself up and
damaged the vehicle.


The attack was the latest in a series of assaults against the
Iraqi police services recruited from local Sunni tribes.
