Australian regulators Sunday blocked a private equity
consortium's multi-billion dollar takeover bid for Qantas
Airways.


The Takeovers Panel said it would not consider an appeal by
Airline Partners Australia (APA) to accept a flurry of late share
acceptances which put the bid over the required minimum.


The group behind the 11.1 billion dollar (9.2 billion US) bid
needed a minimum 50 percent of share acceptances by 7:00 pm
Friday (0900 GMT).


It failed to reach this level by the deadline, but acceptances
from a major American shareholder pushed the group over the
minimum threshold to 50.6 percent some five hours later.


"The panel has decided not to commence proceedings in relation to
APA's application," it said in a statement.


The bidding consortium, which is led by Macquarie Bank,
immediately said it would challenge the ruling by asking for a
second decision from the panel.


"Airline Partners Australia (APA) is seeking an urgent review of
today's decision by the Takeovers Panel which has declined to
hear APA's application to allow the offer for Qantas to proceed,"
it said.


"APA notes that a majority of Qantas shareholders (around 60
percent by number) representing more than 50 percent of Qantas
shares have indicated their support for the offer."
