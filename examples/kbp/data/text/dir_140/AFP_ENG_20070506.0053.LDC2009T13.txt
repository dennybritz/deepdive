World champion Jorge Lorenzo won the motorcycling 250cc Grand
Prix of China here on Sunday for his third victory of the season
after starting from pole.


The Spaniard swept around the 5.3-kilometre circuit on an Aprilia
in a time of 44 mins 17.095 secs, as countryman and Aprilia rider
Alvaro Bautista squeezed by Italy's Andrea Dovizioso on a Honda
on the last lap.


After a string of uncharacteristic errors that cost him five
places early on, the Palma de Mallorca native retook the lead on
lap seven to win the 21-lap race by nearly four seconds.


Lorenzo, who came fourth here last year, has proven nearly
unbeatable this season, scoring two poles and two victories in
Qatar and Spain after finishing second in Turkey two weeks ago.


The win after four races gives Lorenzo, who turned 20 on
Saturday, a commanding 95-point lead in the championship
standings over his closest rival Dovizioso, with 68 and Alex de
Angelis on 59.
