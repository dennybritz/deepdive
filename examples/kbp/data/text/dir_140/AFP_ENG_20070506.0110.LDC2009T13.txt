A car bomb ripped through a busy market in a mostly Shiite
Baghdad neighbourhood of Bayaa on Sunday killing at least 20
people, security officials said.


The blast, which the defence ministry said also wounded at least
45 people, was the latest bomb attack targeting the Iraqi
capital's Shiite population.


Bordered by Sunni neighbourhoods, Bayaa is one of the many
battlefields in the sectarian conflict raging in Baghdad.
