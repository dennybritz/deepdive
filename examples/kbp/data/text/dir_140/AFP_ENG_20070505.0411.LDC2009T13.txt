The Detroit Red Wings moved within one win of advancing in the
National Hockey League Stanley Cup playoffs on Saturday, but
they'll have to continue the quest without Mathieu Schneider.


Schneider, a key member of Detroit's defense corps, broke his
wrist early in the Red Wings' 4-1 victory over San Jose in game
five of their Western Conference semi-final playoff series. He is
expected to miss the rest of the postseason.


Schneider, 37, was hurt when he was checked by Sharks captain
Patrick Marleau during his third shift of the game.


A native of New York, he has recorded two goals - including the
overtime winner in game four of this series - and four assists in
11 postseason contests.


"He's done," Detroit coach Mike Babcock said. "There's nothing
you can do. Maybe there could be a miracle, but he's done."


"(Schneider's) a big part of our game," Red Wings captain and
Norris Trophy finalist Nicklas Lidstrom added. "He's a top-four
defenseman who plays a lot of minutes. He's a big part of our
power play, so yeah, he'll be missed."


The Red Wings, who nolw hold a three-games-to-two lead over the
Sharks in the best-of-seven series, already are without
defensemen Niklas Kronwall and Brett Lebda.


Kronwall has been sidelined since March 30 with a fractured
sacrum, while Lebda has not played since suffering a sprained
ankle in game five of the first round series against Calgary.
