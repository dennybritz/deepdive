Surging demand for LCD televisions and mobile phones has prompted
a major Japanese electronics company to make a massive investment
in a new production centre.


TDK Corp. will invest 50 billion yen (416 million dollars) in the
new ceramic capacitor plant, the business daily Nikkei reported
Sunday.


Orders for the devices are increasing because LCD (liquid crystal
display) televisions and mobile phone handsets are getting bigger
and more complicated, the daily said.


The plant will be built in an industrial park in Akita
Prefecture, north of Tokyo, and go into operation early next
year, boosting TDK's output capacity of ceramic capacitors by 40
percent, the Nikkei said.


The electronic devices help improve power efficiency and help
keep the size of home appliances and communications equipment to
a minimum.


TDK, the world's largest maker of magnetic heads used in hard-
disc drives, combines with other Japanese firms Murata Mfg. Co.,
Taiyo Yuden Co. and Kyocera Corp. to share nearly 80 percent of
the global market for high-performance ceramic capacitors, the
report said.


Murata and Kyocera also plan to invest several tens of billions
of yen to boost production, the Nikkei said.
