Nine members of the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO)
peacekeeping mission were killed when a French military plane
crashed in Egypt's northern Sinai region Sunday, an Egyptian
official said.


"Nine people on board the plane died in the crash. This included
eight French crew members," the security official told AFP on
condition of anonymity.


The MFO and French military sources said they had received
reports that a French transport aircraft belonging to the
peacekeeping force had crashed but did not immediately confirm
any casualties.
