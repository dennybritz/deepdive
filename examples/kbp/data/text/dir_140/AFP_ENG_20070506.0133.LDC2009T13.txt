Two Yemenis convicted of trying to kill a former US ambassador to
Sanaa had their jail terms reduced by a special court on Sunday
from five years to three after they appealed.


Hizam Ali al-Mass, 17, and Khaled Saleh al-Heleila, 18, were
found guilty in March last year of attempting in 2004 to set off
two bombs near a shop in the south of the capital where Edmund
James Hull had stopped.


Hull was the American ambassador from October 2001 until July
2004. He was accused by the ruling General People's Congress
party in April 2002 of behaving "like a high commissioner" and
"interfering" in domestic affairs, and threatened with expulsion.


Before taking up his post in Sanaa, Hull was the US Principal
Deputy Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism and a member of the
inter-agency Counter-Terrorism Security Group.


Yemen is the ancestral home of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden,
and since the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United
States it has been cracking down on suspected militants with
Washington's help.
