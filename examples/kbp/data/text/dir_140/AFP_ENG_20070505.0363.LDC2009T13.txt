Street Sense, ridden by Calvin Borel and trained by Carl Nafzger,
won the Kentucky Derby here on Saturday, capturing the first leg
of US flat racing's Triple Crown.


Street Sense overtook Hard Spun in the final straight to win the
133rd running of the 1 1/4-mile race, which was attended by
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.


Rallying from way back, Street Sense became the first colt to win
the Kentucky Derby after winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.


Hard Spun held on for second, followed by Curlin.
