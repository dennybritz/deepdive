The Czech Republic's Lukas Pesek won the Chinese 125cc
motorcycling Grand Prix here Sunday beating Spaniards Hector
Faubel and Esteve Rabat in a thrilling battle.


The 21-year-old Derbi team rider started from third and fell back
early before surging into the lead with three laps to go to score
his first victory in 58 starts.


Faubel, 23, who won the season opener in Qatar and took third in
Spain held on for second place, while teenager Rabat scored his
first podium in 13 starts.


Pesek now tops the championship standings with 71 points.
Hungary's Gabor Talmacsi, who finished fourth, has 69 points with
Faubel on 67.


It was another disappointing outing for Mattia Pasini of Italy
who despite starting first on the grid - for the third successive
race - finished 10th.
