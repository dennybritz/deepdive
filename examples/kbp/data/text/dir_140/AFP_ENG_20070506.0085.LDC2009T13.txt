The only candidate in Turkey's presidential election, Foreign
Minister Abdullah Gul, said he will withdraw if he fails to get
elected in Sunday's re-run vote in parliament.


If the number of MPs taking part in the ballot falls below the
required two- thirds quorum of 367, "I will withdraw," Gul told
journalists in parliament before the scheduled vote.


The opposition is boycotting the re-run, just as it did the
initial vote on April 27 which was declared invalid by the
Constitutional Court because the legal quorum was not
established.
