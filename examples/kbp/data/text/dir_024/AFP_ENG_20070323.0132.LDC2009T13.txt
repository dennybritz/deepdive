Japan gave Sri Lanka a 320-million-dollar loan Friday to build
roads and improve drinking water supply in key cities, the
Japanese embassy here said.


About 217 million dollars would be spent on road construction,
and the remaining used to expand water and sanitation facilities
in the capital Colombo and Kandy, Sri Lanka's second-largest
city, the embassy said in a statement.


The loan agreement was signed here between Sri Lanka's treasury
chief Punchi Banda Jayasundera and Nobuaki Ito, the acting head
of the Japanese embassy.


Japan is the biggest bilateral aid giver to Sri Lanka, which is
battling a 35 -year-old Tamil separatist conflict that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.


Finance ministry figures here show that Japan had given 198.8
million dollars to Sri Lanka between January and September last
year.


"Japan also recognises the importance for Sri Lanka to make
efforts to resolve the ethnic problem through peaceful dialogue,"
the embassy statement said.


More than 4,000 people have died since December 2005 in fighting
between Tamil rebels and government forces despite a Norwegian-
brokered truce that has been in place since February 2002.
