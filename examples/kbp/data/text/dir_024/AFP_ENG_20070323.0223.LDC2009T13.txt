Thai junta leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin said Friday that
he would not seek to become prime minister in elections he has
promised to hold by the end of the year.


"I want to reassure the nation that I will not take up the post
of prime minister. I am not fit for that position," he said in an
interview on government-owned television Channel 3.


"My position about the prime minister is that he must come from
among the members of parliament," he said.


Some generals in the junta have previously insisted that the new
constitution should include a clause to allow for an appointed
prime minister.


That proposal has been condemned by many of the activists who
supported the coup, which the generals said they staged to
promote democracy by ridding the government of corruption.


Earlier in the week, Sonthi had declined to rule out the
possibility that he would seek a political role after the
elections.


"I was joking with the reporter," Sonthi said of his earlier
remarks.


"That the position is too high for me," he added.


The military has promised to hold a referendum on a new
constitution and general elections by the end of the year.


Sonthi led the coup on September 19 that ousted prime minister
Thaksin Shinawatra, whom the military accused of widespread
corruption.


Although initially welcomed in Bangkok, six months later polls
show public support is waning amid concerns about a weakening
economy and fears that the junta could try to hang on to power.


The junta has also been criticised by supporters of the coup that
the new government has not moved aggressively enough to prosecute
Thaksin over alleged corruption.
