Nigeria's inflation rate dropped to 7.7 percent in the 12 months
ending February 2007 from 8.0 percent the previous month, the
National Bureau of Statistics said Friday.


The agency attributed the fall in the month to a decline in the
costs of fuel, transport and beverages in the oil-rich west
African country of some 140 million people.


Nigerian inflation has been falling steadily since the third
quarter of last year as a result of government's tight fiscal and
monetary policies.


Nigeria, Africa's biggest producer of crude oil, is the fifth-
largest exporter in the world, acccounting for a daily output of
around 2.6 million barrels, a quarter of which is currently lost
to unrest in the volatile Niger delta region.
