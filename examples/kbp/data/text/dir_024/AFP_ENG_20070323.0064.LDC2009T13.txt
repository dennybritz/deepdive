Sri Lankan cricket authorities came under fire Friday for
fielding a delegation of officials that is set to outnumber the
national team at the sport's World cup showcase in the Caribbean.


The state-run Daily News said Sri Lanka Cricket was forking out
23 million rupees (212,000 dollars) on a 20-member official
delegation that will fly out shortly.


The group includes family members of VIPs, the paper said.


"As far as Sri Lanka Cricket is concerned, the official team is
limited to only 15," a top official of the local governing body
said, referring to the players, coach and physio already out
there.


He declined to give details of who would be in the delegation
nominated by the sports ministry.


"The tragedy here is that the ministry expects Sri Lanka Cricket
to pay for the travel of politicians," said the official, who
asked not to be named.


Sri Lanka Cricket sources said that more people were now
clamouring to be included in the official entourage following Sri
Lanka's win Tuesday against Bangladesh.


Sri Lanka, one of the pre-tournament favourites, are virtually
assured of their place in the next round.
