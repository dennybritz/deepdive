Warring tribesmen and foreign Al-Qaeda militants agreed to a
ceasefire after four days of bloodshed in a Pakistani border
region that left up to 160 people dead, officials said Friday.


Islamic religious leaders mediated the ceasefire overnight in
mountainous South Waziristan, where Uzbek and Chechen insurgents
fought mortar and rocket battles with local tribes, they said.


"There has been no fighting since last night in South Waziristan
but fighters loyal to the rival factions are maintaining position
on hilltops," a local government source told AFP.


"The ceasefire has been achieved because of the efforts of local
mullahs," he said.


Fierce fighting broke out on Monday after ex-Taliban commander
Mullah Nazir, whom the government says has come over to its side,
ordered followers of Uzbek militant Tahir Yuldashev to disarm.


The clashes have killed 130 Uzbek and Chechan militants and
between 25 and 30 tribesmen, the governor of North West Frontier
Province told a news conference earlier Friday.
