The number of Iraqis seeking asylum in industralised countries
rose by 77 percent in the space of a year, the UN refugee agency
said Friday, contrary to a global trend of fewer asylum seekers.


The growing flight of Iraqis stood in stark contrast with the
overall fall in the number of people seeking refuge in
industralised countries in 2006, marking the fifth straight year
of decline, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
said in a statement.


Some 300,000 asylum applications were submitted in the 50
industralised countries surveyed last year, 10 percent fewer than
in 2005 and less than half the number recorded five years ago,
according to the provisional data.


The number of asylum seekers in Europe as a whole, as well as in
the European Union, reached their lowest levels for two decades,
the UNHCR said.


However, asylum applications by Iraqis in industrialised
countries rose from 12,500 in 2005 to 22,200 in 2006.


The figures for Iraqi asylum seekers still remain well below the
peak level of about 50,000 reached during 2002.


Sweden was the favourite destination for Iraqis in industrialised
countries last year, with some 9,000 applications, followed by
the Netherlands (2,800), Germany (2,100) and Greece (1,400).


Iraqis were the largest single national group of asylum seekers,
followed by Chinese (18,300), people from Russia (15,700), Serbia
and Montenegro (15,700) and Turkey (8.700).
