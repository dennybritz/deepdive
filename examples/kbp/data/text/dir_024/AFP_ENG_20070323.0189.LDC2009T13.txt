French presidential candidates Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal
are at level pegging in the election race, according to a new
poll Friday which showed a big improvement in the Socialist
candidate's score.


Four weeks ahead of election day, the two frontrunners both get
26 percent in the multi-candidate first round, and then both get
50 percent in the decisive second round two weeks later,
according to the CSA poll for Le Parisien newspaper.


The survey was a boost for Royal, who has been behind Sarkozy in
practically every poll since January.


Francois Bayrou, the centrist candidate who has surged in recent
weeks to challenge the two leaders in the race, is on 21 percent
according to the poll.


However a second poll for IPSOS showed Sarkozy, candidate of the
ruling centre- right, winning by 54 percent to 46 percent over
Royal in the second round.


In the first round on April 22, Sarkozy would get 31.5 percent,
Royal 24.5 percent and Bayrou 19 percent, according to IPSOS.
