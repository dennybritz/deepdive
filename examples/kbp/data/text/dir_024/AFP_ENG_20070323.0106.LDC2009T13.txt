Japan on Friday approved emergency response guidelines that will
allow the armed forces to fire interceptor missiles without the
prime minister's prior approval, officials said.


The new guideline will allow the defence minister to order the
interception of incoming ballistic missiles, and comes ahead of
the deployment of Patriot surface-to-air missiles in northern
Tokyo next week.


"This is a guideline that allows the Defence Ministry to order
its Self-Defense Forces, without the prime minister's consent, to
intercept missiles," a defence ministry official said.


Defence officials said the emergency measures could also be used
to respond to foreign satellites crashing into Japan.


Japan and the United States started working in earnest on a
missile shield after North Korea in 1998 fired a missile over
Japan's main island.


They vowed to accelerate the programme after North Korea in July
test-fired seven missiles into the Sea of Japan (East Sea).
