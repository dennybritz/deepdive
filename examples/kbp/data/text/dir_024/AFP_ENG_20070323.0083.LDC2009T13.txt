Bangladesh's cricket board said Friday it was shocked and
distressed after it was announced that Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer
had been murdered.


"The news that Bob Woolmer was murdered has shattered us. It is a
quite unexpected event which we cannot yet quite believe," board
chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman told AFP.


"Our hearts go out to his family and we hope that the
investigation can get to the bottom of his murder so the
perpetrators can be punished," he added.


Woolmer, 58, died on Sunday in Kingston, Jamaica, after being
found unconscious in his hotel room following Pakistan's surprise
World Cup defeat by Ireland.


Jamaican police have said he was strangled, prompting speculation
that he might have been killed because he was about to reveal
what he knew about alleged match-fixing.


The cricket board earlier this week praised Woolmer, who had
coaching stints in Bangladesh in 2003, as a "fine cricketer ...
and a top class coach."
