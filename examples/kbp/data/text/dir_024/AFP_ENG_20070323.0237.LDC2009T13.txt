The US military announced Friday the deaths of two more
servicemen in Iraq, where American troops are battling a raging
insurgency and sectarian bloodshed.


A soldier was killed on Thursday when a roadside bomb exploded
alongside a military patrol in west Baghdad. A marine was killed
in combat operations in the Anbar province, a Sunni insurgent
stronghold west of the capital.


The deaths brought to 3,227 the US military's losses in Iraq
since the invasion just over four years ago, according to an AFP
tally based on Pentagon figures.
