Pakistan said Friday it was rushing a senior diplomat from
Washington to Jamaica after Caribbean police said national team
cricket coach Bob Woolmer was strangled.


"We do not have any diplomatic presence in Jamaica and we have
decided to send a senior official from our Washington mission to
interact with Caribbean authorities," foreign ministry
spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam told AFP.


"The official will handle the affair with the police," Aslam
said.


She said Pakistan's Washington embassy was "accredited to handle
affairs in Jamaica" involving the South Asian nation.


Jamaican police said Friday Woolmer was likely strangled by
someone he knew. A pathologist's report showed the coach had died
by "asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation," they said
earlier.


Woolmer was declared dead in hospital Sunday after being found
unconscious in his room. He was 58.


He died the day after Pakistan were humiliatingly dumped out of
the cricket World Cup in the Caribbean by minnows Ireland.
