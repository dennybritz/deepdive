Iran said Friday that the United States had yet to issue a
promised visa for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to travel to the
United Nations to address the Security Council on his country's
controversial nuclear programme.


"Despite the official processing and American officials' promises
in the media, the president's and his delegation's visas have not
been issued up to this moment," deputy foreign minister Abbas
Araghchi told the state news agency IRNA.


"It seems that American officials are creating problems ... in
order to prevent the Iranian president's presence at the Security
Council which would clarify facts and positions," he said.


The US State Department said on Monday that Washington had
granted visas for Ahmadinejad and 38 aides and bodyguards so he
can address the UN Security Council when it votes on a new
sanctions resolution on Saturday.


Ahmadinejad has said he will present "new proposals" to end the
standoff.
