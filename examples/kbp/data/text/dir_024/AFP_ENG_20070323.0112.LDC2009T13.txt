South Korean share prices are expected to be rangebound in the
coming week with investors likely to lock in gains ahead of the
corporate quarterly earnings reporting season, dealers said
Friday.


They said they see few drivers next week, especially after the
recent recovery from lows seen earlier this month in global
market turbulence sparked by heavy losses on China and then
concerns over the US economic outlook.


For the week to March 23, the composite index rose 19.5 points or
1.4 percent to 1,447.38.


Average daily volume was 307.8 million shares worth 2.96 trillion
won (3.2 billion dollars), up from 258.4 million shares worth
2.74 trillion won the week earlier.


"We don't see any particular momentum in the coming week to move
the market and it is expected to trade within a limited range,"
said Lee Woo-Hyun of Kyobo Securities.


"Investors will focus on stocks whose performance is expected to
improve in the second quarter. They include IT shares and
equipment stocks."


Lee also noted that investors were jittery about the index which
had risen too sharply over too short a period.


"There are no leads that are able to push the index up above
1,500 points. The market is expected to move sideways in the
forseeable future," said Oh Hyun-Seok of Samsung Securities.
