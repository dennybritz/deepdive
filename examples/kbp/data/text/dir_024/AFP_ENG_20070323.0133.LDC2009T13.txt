European stock markets fell on Friday after a mixed overnight
showing on Wall Street and despite a positive finish earlier in
Tokyo, dealers said.


In early European deals, London's FTSE 100 index of leading

40 index slid 0.24 percent to 5,584.80.

The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip shares decreased
0.49 percent to 4,149.71 points.

New York markets had ended mixed on Thursday as the market
digested a powerful rally on Wednesday as investors focused on
prospects for a cut in US interest rates later this year.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.11 percent to close at
12,461.14 after a big 1.3 percent gain on Wednesday.


However, the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.17 percent to 2,451.74
while the broad- market Standard and Poor's 500 lost a fractional
0.03 percent to 1,434.54.


Japanese share prices closed higher on Friday, extending their
winning streak to a fourth trading day as a weaker yen gave a
lift to exporters, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index of leading
shares gained 0.35 percent to end the week at 17,480.61 points.
