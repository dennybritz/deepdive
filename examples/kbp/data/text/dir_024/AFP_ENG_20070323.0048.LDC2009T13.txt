The Philippine navy said Friday it had detained 45 Chinese
fishermen who were fishing illegally in local waters.


The men were aboard three Chinese-registered boats intercepted by
the Philippine Navy in the channel between Basilan island and
this southern port, said Rear Admiral Emilio Marayag, the navy
chief for the region.


He said the fishermen denied they were poaching and said they
were only passing through on their way back to China from
Indonesia when their vessels ran low on fuel.


The boats were escorted to Zamboanga after they were intercepted
on March 17. The crew remained on the boats under guard as the
government prepared to file criminal charges against them.


"If found guilty they will be fined 100,000 dollars," Marayag
told reporters.


The foreign department is notifying the Chinese embassy in Manila
of the arrests, Marayag added.
