An ex-terror suspect who was jailed for more than three years in
the US military's Guantanamo Bay prison will be among the
candidates when Australia's most populous state goes to the polls
on Saturday.


Mamdouh Habib is regarded as a rank outsider for the seat he is
contesting in suburban Sydney but said he hoped to send a message
to the state of New South Wales, home to seven million of
Australia's 20 million population.


Launching his campaign last month, Habib said he represented "the
right of freedom of expression, opposition to the anti-terrorist
laws ... the right to fight racism, the end of scapegoating of
Aborigines, Muslims and migrants."


Habib also listed "the right to oppose Australia's involvement in
Iraq" as a motivating factor behind his election tilt.


The 51-year-old father of four was detained in Pakistan in late
2001 on suspicion of terrorist links and eventually jailed at
Guanatanamo after first being handed over to authorities in
Egypt.


He alleged that he was tortured while being held in Egypt and
forced to make a false confession.


He was released without charge by US authorities in January 2005
and has insisted since his return that he was not a terrorist and
had no ties to Al- Qaeda.


He is trying to win a set for Auburn, in Sydney's western suburbs
-- an area that is home to Australia's largest mosque and a
significant portion of the country's 300,000 Muslims.
