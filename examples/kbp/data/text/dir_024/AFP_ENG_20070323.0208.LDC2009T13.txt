Illyrian ships believed to date back more than 2,000 years have
been discovered for the first time at a marshland in southern
Bosnia, local archaeologists said Friday.


The wooden relics of the two ships were located some eight meters
(26 feet) under water at the Hutovo Blato nature reserve, said
Sarajevo University professor Snjezana Vasilj, whose team made
the find.


They are believed to have been trading or pirate ships that sank
in the marshlands some 2,200 years ago, and were identified as
Illyrian based on design features, Vasilj told AFP.


Illyrian ships are mentioned in Greek and Roman historic records,
but this is the first time they have been found, she said.


At the site, archaeologists found fragments of numerous amphoras
and lids bearing Roman and Greek emblems, as well as a Roman
spear and remains of an ancient Roman settlement.


They also uncovered seven graves at a nearby site believed to
date from the Bronze or Iron Age.


Vasilj said her team had protected the ships' remains using a
special plastic cover until more funds could be found in order to
enable the research to continue.


The archaeology work at the graves and the settlement has been
interrupted by rain but will resume once the weather improves.


The spear and samples of the ships' wood are likely to be sent to
Germany for a carbon dating tests.


Illyrians, who frequently engaged in piracy, were the earliest
known inhabitants of the western Balkans, including Bosnia, long
before the Roman Empire took control of the region.


Their descendants are believed to be Albanians.
