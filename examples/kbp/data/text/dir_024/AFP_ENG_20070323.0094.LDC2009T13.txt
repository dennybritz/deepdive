Jamaican police think it likely that Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer
was strangled by someone he knew after his team's defeat at
cricket's World Cup showpiece, a senior officer told British
radio Friday.


"It seems difficult to believe at this stage that it was a
complete stranger," the deputy police commissioner in Kingston
Mark Shields said in an interview with BBC Radio Live.


"It is imperative that we keep an open mind, but I have to say at
this stage it looks as if it may be somebody somehow linked to
him, because clearly he let somebody into his hotel room and it
may be that he knew who that person was."


Shields said that police were probing video recordings from the
hotel's closed circuit television cameras but had not yet found
anything suspicious.


Shields also "unequivocally dismissed" rumours that arrests had
been made. "That's nonsense, as far as I'm concerned. There's
actually no truth in that," he said.


In a press conference Thursday, Jamaican police spokesman Karl
Angell confirmed Woolmer had been the victim of foul play.


"The pathologist report states that Mr. Woolmer's death was due
to asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation," Angell said.


"In these circumstances, the matter of Mr. Robert Woolmer's death
is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder."


Woolmer was declared dead in hospital Sunday after being found
unconscious in his room. He was 58.


The day before Pakistan -- the 1992 World Cup winners -- were
knocked out of the 2007 version in the Caribbean.


"I don't want to talk about suspects at this stage," Shields said
Thursday.


He suggested more than one person may have been involved because
he was a large man and difficult to subdue.
