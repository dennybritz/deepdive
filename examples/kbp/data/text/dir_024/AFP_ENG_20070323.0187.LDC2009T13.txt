Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi was wounded in an
explosion on Friday and rushed to a US military hospital in
Baghdad for treatment, a US military spokesman told AFP.


"He was admitted in a US combat hospital an hour ago," Lieutenant
Colonel Christopher Garver said, providing no further details.


An Iraqi security source said three people were killed and 10
others wounded in a double suicide and car bomb attack near
Zubayi's home, office and mosque close to the highly fortified
Green Zone in central Baghdad.
