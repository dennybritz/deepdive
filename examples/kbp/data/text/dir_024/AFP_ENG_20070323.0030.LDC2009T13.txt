A Japanese court refused Friday to grant compensation to orphans
left behind in China after World War II, the third time such
claims have been dismissed.


Thousands of Japanese children were abandoned in China when the
Japanese occupiers were defeated in 1945 and their parents either
were killed or fled.


In the latest case, four orphans aged from 64 to 77 and now
living in southern Japan demanded 132 million yen (1.1 million
dollars) in compensation, saying the government failed to swiftly
repatriate and care for them.


They returned to Japan between 1982 and 1995 and speak little
Japanese.


But Tokushima District Court Judge Masayuki Abe said the Japanese
government had implemented measures necessary for their return,
although he added that the government's support for repatriated
war orphans remains weak.


"It is difficult to acknowledge that the government is carrying
out its full responsibility to allow war-displaced people to lead
independent lives," the judge said.


The ruling follows similar verdicts from the Tokyo and Osaka
district courts, which have dismissed suits by war orphans.


Only the district court in the western city of Kobe ordered the
state last December to pay 468 million yen to 61 ageing war
orphans, saying the government had let them down.


In total, more than a dozen similiar suits have been brought in
the Japanese courts. The rest are pending.


Most war orphans were adopted in China and adapted to that
country's culture and customs before returning to Japan as adults
after the two countries restored relations in 1972.
