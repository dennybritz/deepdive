Fierce fighting to clear a Taliban stronghold in southern
Afghanistan left seven police dead, the defence ministry said
Friday after police earlier announced 40 Taliban deaths.


Afghan police and troops began a sweep of part of the southern
province of Helmand on Thursday, when police announced the
Taliban toll and said three policemen had died.


The operation had cleared about three villages near the town of
Gereshk and was continuing Friday, the ministry said in a
statement.


More than 40 Taliban bodies had been recovered and two vehicles
and more than 50 insurgent weapons had been seized, it added.


"Unfortunately seven police were martyred and 12 were injured,"
it said.


NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was lending
air support and and medical evacuation capabilities, a spokesman
said.


Police said Thursday that security forces had launched the
operation from Gereshk and the provincial capital Lashkar Gah, to
the southwest.


The area has already seen fierce fighting, including ISAF
bombings on Taliban compounds.


Helmand, where ISAF has deployed thousands of British troops, is
one of the most troubled and dangerous provinces of Afghanistan.


The small town of Musa Qala has been in Taliban control since
early February and the Western military acknowledges that other
remote areas are also in insurgent hands.


ISAF on March 6 launched a major operation involving 5,500 Afghan
and foreign forces in the northern part of Helmand targeting
Taliban, hundreds of foreign jihadists in the area and opium
traders.
