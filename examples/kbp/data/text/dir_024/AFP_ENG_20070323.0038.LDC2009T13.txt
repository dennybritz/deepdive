Four crew members died and five are missing after a fishing boat
capsized early Friday off the southeast coast of South Korea,
marine police said.


The 59-ton boat went down while fishing about three miles off
Hong Island. An Indonesian and a South Korean crew member were
rescued but the latter died on the way to hospital. The
Indonesian is receiving medical treatment.


Three people including the Korean captain were found dead inside
the boat hours after the accident, Yonhap news agency reported.


Five other crew members, including another Indonesian and one
Chinese, are missing, police said.


The boat was trawling for anchovies with another boat. Police
said they were stepping up rescue efforts but the number of dead
may increase.
