The European Union's 50th birthday declaration will include a
commitment to try to resolve the bloc's constitutional impasse by
2009, the German EU presidency said Friday.


The "Berlin Declaration" is to be signed by the presidency and
the heads of the European Commission and Parliament in the German
capital Sunday to mark the 50th anniversary of the EU's founding
Treaty of Rome,


"The presidents of the institutions agree that we need to put the
European Union on a new, sound foundation by 2009," a presidency
official told reporters, on condition of anonymity.


The constitution was meant to simplify decision-making as the EU
expands, as well as establish a longer-term president and foreign
minister, but it was rejected by French and Dutch voters in
referendums two years ago and has been in limbo since then.


German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants the impasse to end by 2009,
when the next European Parliament elections are to be held, but
this has proved controversial with other leaders.


Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said Thursday that Prague
would prefer that "no concrete date be mentioned in the text."
The Czech Republic is scheduled to hold the EU's presidency for
six months that year.


But the presidency official suggested Merkel had overcome this
problem in fresh talks early Friday with Topolanek.


The official said the declaration, to be made public early Sunday
afternoon, had been finalised and that the only delay now was the
need to translate it into the EU's 23 languages.
