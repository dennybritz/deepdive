A Vietnamese court on Friday sentenced a former deputy trade
minister to 14 years' jail for accepting bribes in return for
lucrative quotas to export textiles to the United States.


Mai Van Dau, 64, was found guilty by the Ho Chi Minh City
People's Court of taking a total of 6,000 dollars in bribes from
garment companies in 2003 and 2004, said a court official.


The court imposed a heavier sentence than the 10 to 12 years
demanded by prosecutors in Vietnam's first major graft trial
since Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung took office last year vowing
to crack down on endemic corruption.


Twelve other defendants in the case also received jail terms.


The court reserved its heaviest punishment for Le Van Thang, the
former deputy head of the Trade Ministry's import-export
department, who received 17 years' jail for organising most of
the bribes.


Textiles are Vietnam's largest export after oil, but shipments to
the United States were capped at the time through quotas as
Washington sought to protect its garment industry from cheap
imports.


Dau was in charge of allocating the quotas under the system,
which has now been abolished. Vietnam joined the World Trade
Organisation in January, allowing producers open access to the US
market.
