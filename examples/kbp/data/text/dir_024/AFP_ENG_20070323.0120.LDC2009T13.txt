Hong Kong share prices closed flat Friday as the market
consolidated strong gains made over the past four days as the
market recovered on the back of solid results from the major
companies, dealers said.


Buying momentum turned weak Friday, however, with most of the top
company results now out and trade was cautious as the market
awaited key housing data in the US after Wall Street provided no
lead overnight.


The Hang Seng Index added 2.39 points at 19,692.64, off a low of
19,634.11 and high of 19,729.49. For the week, the market was up
739.14 points or 3.9 percent.
