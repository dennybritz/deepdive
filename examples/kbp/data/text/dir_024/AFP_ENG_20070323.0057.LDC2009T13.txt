Conservative Roman Catholic bishops in the Philippines were not
amused when three nuns were photographed playing slot machines
and blackjack at a gaming fair in Manila.


The church, which frowns on all forms of gambling, launched an
inquiry and says the nuns could face sanctions from the Catholic
Bishops Conference of the Philippines if found to have sinned.


Archbishop Oscar Cruz told local radio Tuesday that he has
ordered an investigation and will take "steps on the sisters'
actions."


Cruz said the church "strictly prohibits men of the cloth...
including nuns ... from gambling."


Cruz said the church recently defrocked a parish priest who was
caught gambling in a provincial casino.


He described as "shameful" photographs and television footage
showing nuns playing blackjack and trying out slot machines at
the launch of a Gaming Expo in Manila.


Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. spokesman, Edward King,
described the incident as "innocent."


"The sisters are innocent of the ways and means of the world. I'm
not saying they are saints."


He said the nuns "played without money" and denied the nuns were
tricked into playing blackjack and using the slot machines.
