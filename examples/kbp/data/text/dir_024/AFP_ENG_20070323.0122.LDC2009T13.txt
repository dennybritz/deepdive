Spanish airline Iberia is the target of takeover interest from
two airlines and two private equity groups, Spanish newspaper El
Pais reported on Friday.


The newspaper, which did not cite sources, said German airline
Lufthansa, British carrier British Airways, US private equity
fund Texas Pacific Group and an unnamed Spanish private equity
fund had shown an interest in bidding for the group.


Iberia chairman Fernando Conte had informed the board of the
interest on Thursday, the newspaper said.


Lufthansa chief executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber had said on Thursday
that the German carrier "did not request information" on Iberia,
however.
