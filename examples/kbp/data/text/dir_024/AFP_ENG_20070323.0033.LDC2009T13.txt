At least eight navy officers were killed Friday when their
helicopter crashed into a rice field and burst into flames in
northeastern Thailand, officials said.


The helicopter was on a routine training flight when it crashed
in Surin province, 455 kilometers (280 miles) northeast of the
capital Bangkok.


"Eight or nine people were on this flight to U Tapao navy base in
Chon Buri province, and no one survived," navy spokesman Captain
Korkiart Pundee told AFP.


"The helicopter was a Bell 214 that developed a mechanical
problem before the crash," he added.
