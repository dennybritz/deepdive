A declaration marking the 50th anniversary of the European Union
will state that member states want to find a solution to the
crisis prompted by the rejection of the EU constitution by 2009,
the German EU presidency said Friday.


"We must constantly renew Europe's political form and the
European leaders have agreed that between now and 2009 the EU is
based on new foundations," a German official said.
