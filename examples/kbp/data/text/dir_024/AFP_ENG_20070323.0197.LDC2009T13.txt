Newcastle scored two tries in the last 12 minutes to knock off St
George Illawarra 16-12 in Australia's National Rugby League at
Jubilee Stadium here Friday.


In Friday's other match, Penrith crushed tackle-shy Canterbury
Bulldogs 40-10 at Penrith.


The Newcastle Knights capitalised on the Dragons' errors to
remain unbeaten after two rounds following their one-point defeat
of Canterbury at home last week.


The Dragons had only themselves to blame for letting the Knights
back into the match, with dropped balls inside their own half
leading to tries for Knights centres Brad Tighe and George
Carmont.


Newcastle were playing without their inspirational skipper and
former Test scrum-half Andrew Johns, who had the week off after
being knocked out by a high tackle against Canterbury in the
opening round.


At Penrith, a powerhouse second-half display from controversial
forward Frank Pritchard helped the Panthers overpower the
Bulldogs.


Pritchard, playing his first match after a thumb injury sustained
in a street brawl for which he is facing police charges, scored a
try in the 55th minute and was placed on report for a high tackle
on Bulldogs loose forward Reni Maituia 16 minutes from fulltime.


The Panthers scored six tries to one and centre Mick Gordon
kicked eight goals from eight attempts, while Bulldogs'
sharpshooter Hazem El Masri took his tally to 28 consecutive
goals, stretching back to last season.
