A four-year-old boy was killed early Friday after being caught in
crossfire between rival Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip,
medics and security sources said.


Hassan Abu Nada was killed and three other people wounded during
gunfire exchanges in the northern town of Beit Lahiya between
supporters of the Islamist Hamas and president Mahmud Abbas's
secular Fatah, they said.


It marked at least the third death in Gaza as a result of
internecine violence since the Palestinians formed a unity
government on Saturday, hoping to put an end to the bloodshed.


The inauguration of the new coalition was supposed to stop the
factional violence between Fatah and Hamas, which has killed
dozens of Palestinians since mid-December.


The clashes had largely ceased in Gaza since the two rivals
struck a deal to form the government in a summit in Mecca in
early February, though there have been occasional flare-ups of
gunfire, sometimes as a result of family disputes.
