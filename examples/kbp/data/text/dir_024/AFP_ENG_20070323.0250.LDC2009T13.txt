A French judge has banned the head of oil group Total, Christophe
de Margerie, from meeting former Iranian president Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani and his son, a judicial source said on Friday.


Margerie is being probed over alleged bribes for a contract in
Iran, and sources close to the matter said on Friday that
investigators suspected the secretary to Rafsanjani's son of
being the alleged middleman.


The sources said that this connection had emerged as a result of
the questioning of another Total executive on Wednesday.


The name of the former Iranian president's son, Mehdi Hashemi
Rafsanjani, came to the attention of the investigating
magistrate, Philippe Courroye, as a result of a probe by
Norwegian authorities into Norwegian national oil company
Statoil.


The magistrate placed Margerie under formal investigation late on
Thursday on suspicion he had paid bribes to win a big gas
contract in Iran.


The judicial control order also banned the Total chief from
meeting several other leading Iranian figures, the source said.


However, Margerie is free to fulfil his function as the chief
executive of Total, one of the biggest French companies and a
giant in the oil industry.
