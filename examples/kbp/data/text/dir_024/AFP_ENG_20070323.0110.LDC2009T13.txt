Emergency workers continued their search on Friday for two miners
missing after a gas explosion that killed at least 108 people in
Russia's deadliest mining disaster, Russian news agencies
reported.


The search at the Ulyanovskaya mine near the Siberian city of
Novokuznetsk has been complicated by extensive flooding of the
mine due to Monday's blast.


"The water is rising in the coal tunnel where the missing miners
could be," a spokesman for the Kemerovo region's administration
was quoted by RIA Novosti news agency as saying.


Officials are assuming that the two missing men are dead, but the
mine operator has vowed to recover their bodies.


Divers have taken part in the search and the mine is being
ventilated to allow rescuers to install pumps to extract water,
officials said.


Multiple funerals have been taking place in Novokuznetsk, with
nearly 60 people buried on Thursday.
