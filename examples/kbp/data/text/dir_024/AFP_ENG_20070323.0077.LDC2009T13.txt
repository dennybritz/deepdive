Indonesia's rumbling Mount Batutara volcano has triggered the
evacuation of about 15,000 people, an official said Friday.


The villagers have left their homes on Lembata island, which lies
in the Flores sea close to the restive volcano, local official
Andreas Duli Manuk told AFP.


Groundwater in the two affected villages of Buyasuri and Omesuri
had suddenly turned salty, and there were rougher seas around the
smoking volcano's home on the nearby deserted island of Komba, he
said.


Experts have raised Mount Batutara's alert level to the second of
four possible levels, but say an eruption is not imminent.


Fishermen and others who occasionally land on Komba have been
warned to stay at least two kilometres (more than a mile) away.


Indonesia sits on the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire," where
continental plates meet, causing frequent volcanic and seismic
activity.
