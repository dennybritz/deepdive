Authorities in Bangladesh said Friday they had slaughtered tens
of thousands of chickens at farms on the outskirts of Dhaka where
the country's first case of bird flu was confirmed.


More than 40,000 birds were destroyed at six farms. Officials
earlier said only one farm at Savar, 40 kilometres (25 miles)
west of the capital, had been was affected.


"Six farms with 42,400 chickens were infected by bird flu,"
interim government cabinet member Sajjadul Karim told reporters,
adding that all the birds had now been killed.


Officials confirmed Bangladesh's first case of bird flu late
Thursday after samples from one of the farms were sent to the
National Institute of Animal Health in Bangkok, which confirmed
the presence of the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus.


The caretaker government has agreed a string of measures to
prevent the spread of the disease in the densely-populated South
Asian country of 144 million people.


The virulent H5N1 virus has killed at least 169 people since late
2003, most of them in Asia, according to the World Health
Organisation.


Scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form easily spread
among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to
kill millions.


Bangladesh is home to hundreds of thousands of poultry farms
which employ more than a million people.


The country had already banned imports of live birds from more
than 50 countries including neighbouring India and Myanmar after
outbreaks were detected there.
