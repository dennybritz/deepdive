A suicide attacker detonated a vehicle filled with explosives
close to a convoy of foreign forces in eastern Afghanistan
Friday, wounding at least one child, Afghan officials said.


The US-led coalition and NATO force did not immediately have
information about the blast about 3O kilometres (20 miles)
outside the eastern city of Jalalabad.


"One civilian child has been wounded in the blast and we have no
information on casualties to the foreign troops," a district
governor, Khaibar Mohmand, told AFP.


Foreign troops cordoned off the area and prevented Afghan
investigators and reporters from accessing the site.


Mohmand blamed the attack on Taliban insurgents who have waged a
bloody insurgency since their ouster from government in late 2001
in a US-led offensive.
