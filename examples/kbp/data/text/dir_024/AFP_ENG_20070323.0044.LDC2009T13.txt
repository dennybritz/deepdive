The international Red Cross has appealed for donations to combat
a measles epidemic in North Korea which has been worsened by
prolonged malnutrition.


Four people have died and 3,600 have been infected since
November, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in its latest update seen Friday.


It said six million children aged from six months to 15 years
were immunised in the first phase this month of a national
campaign carried out by the communist state's health ministry and
the UN children's agency UNICEF.


The second phase starting mid-April targets more than 10 million
people for vaccinations and doses of Vitamin A.


The re-emergence of measles "is linked to the high risk of
disease outbreaks especially among children and other vulnerable
groups still recovering from prolonged malnutrition during the
winter months," the IFRC said.


There have also been separate reports of outbreaks of scarlet
fever and typhoid in recent months in the reclusive communist
state, where medicine is in short supply and years of
malnutrition have weakened resistance to disease.


Since December South Korean private groups have shipped
penicillin and antibiotics to North Korea, saying scarlet fever
and other communicable diseases are spreading fast.


Famine starting in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands of
people. North Korea has received major foreign food aid since the
mid-1990s but its citizens still suffer persistent food
shortages.
