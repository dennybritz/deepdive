Nine navy officers were killed Friday when their helicopter
crashed into a rice field and burst into flames in northeast
Thailand, officials said.


The Bell 214 helicopter was on a routine training flight when it
crashed in Surin province, 455 kilometers (280 miles) northeast
of the capital Bangkok.


"Nine navy officers are confirmed dead in this morning's crash,
including the two pilots, one of whom was a vice admiral. The
rest were mechanics who were on a training mission," navy
spokesman Captain Korkiart Pundee told AFP.


Navy investigators were examining the crash site to determine the
cause of the accident which was believed to have resulted from a
mechanical problem, he added.
