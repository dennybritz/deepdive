China's largest packing paper company will become the biggest in
Asia when a 1.56 billion dollar plant in the nation's southwest
begins production next year, state press said Friday.


Hong Kong-listed Nine Dragons Paper Industries Co Ltd began
construction on the plant in Chongqing city on Friday, Xinhua
news agency said.


Company founder and chairwoman Zhang Yin is China's richest
person with reported assets valued at 3.4 billion dollars, it
said.


Zhang, 49, built up her paper empire by importing waste paper
from abroad and recycling it to meet China's rising demand for
paper products.


The new plant will be Nine Dragons third production facility and
will employ 8,000 people, it said.


When production starts in Chongqing in 2008, the annual
production capacity of Nine Dragons will rise from the current
3.3 million tonnes to 7.8 million tonnes, surpassing Indonesia's
Asia Pulp and Paper as the largest paper-maker in the region, it
said.
