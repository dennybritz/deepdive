The father of German reunification, former chancellor Helmut
Kohl, will miss a weekend birthday party for the European Union
here because he is recovering from knee surgery, his office said
Friday.


Kohl's office said he "deeply regretted" not being able to attend
the festivities in Berlin marking the 50th anniversary of the
Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic
Community, the forerunner of the EU.


It said the operation in February had gone well but that the 76
-year-old Kohl, who led Germany from 1982 to 1998, was still in
rehabilitation.


The leaders of the 27 EU member states will join the weekend
celebrations, culminating Sunday in the signing of a declaration
spelling out Europe's shared principles and goals.


Meanwhile the head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel
Barroso, said Kohl deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for his
accomplishments in healing Europe's division, in an interview
with Deutsche Welle radio.
