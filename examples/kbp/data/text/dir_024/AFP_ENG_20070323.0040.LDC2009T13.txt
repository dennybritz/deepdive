A Japanese court on Friday fined the disgraced Internet firm
Livedoor Co. 280 million yen (2.4 million dollars) for falsifying
its earnings, a court official said.


The Tokyo District Court's latest punishment follows the
conviction of Livedoor founder Takafumi Horie and four other
executives for tampering with the company's earning reports to
conceal a loss.


The same court also convicted two accountants earlier Friday for
their role in the financial scandal at the once-high flying
Internet firm.


The Tokyo District Court sentenced Taishin Hisano, 42, to 10
months in jail and gave Motoshi Kobayashi, 52, a one year
suspended prison term for colluding with former Livedoor
executives to conceal losses at the company.


The pair, who worked for now-defunct auditing firm Koyo and Co,
have both maintained their innocence.


The Livedoor scandal briefly sent the Tokyo stock market into
freefall last year, forcing Asia's largest bourse to close early
for the first time ever.
