Japan's Sanyo Electric Credit Co. said Friday that it had agreed
to a friendly takeover by US conglomerate General Electric.


The firm, an affiliate of the struggling electronics maker Sanyo
Electric Co., said GE would launch a tender offer at 3,250 yen
(27.50 dollars) per share in the aim of acquiring a stake of at
least 66.67 percent.


The bid values the entire business at 135 billion yen (1.14
billion dollars).


Sanyo Electric holds a 16.68 percent stake in Sanyo Electric
Credit, while top shareholder Goldman Sachs has a 33 percent
share.


A spokesman for Sanyo Electric, which faces allegations of
financial window dressing, said that the group had not yet
decided whether to sell its stake in the affiliate.


Earlier this week Sanyo Electric announced the resignation of its
chairwoman Tomoyo Nonaka, one of Japan's top female executives,
as it grapples with big losses and allegations of dressing up its
results.


The company said in a statement that Nonaka -- a former
journalist -- had resigned for personal reasons, but local media
said she had quit because of the Sanyo board's refusal to fully
probe suspected accounting irregularities.


Last year Sanyo issued 2.6 billion dollars' worth of new shares
to Goldman Sachs, Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking, which together took five of the nine seats on Sanyo's
board.
