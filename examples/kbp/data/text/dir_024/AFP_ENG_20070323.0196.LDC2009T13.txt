Knut, a polar bear cub who has become a global sensation after
cheating death, made his first public appearance at the Berlin
Zoo Friday under the gaze of dozens of photographers and
cameramen.


Knut seemed to lap up the attention, toddling around his
enclosure, occasionally nibbling the boots of his handler Thomas
Doerflein and poking his nose into a pond.


Even German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel got in on the
act, appearing with the little bear after adopting him through
the zoo's sponsorship scheme.


The nine-kilogramme (19-pound) bear has triggered a wave of media
coverage in recent days after an animal activist said he should
have been put down after he and his brother were rejected by
their mother following their birth in December.


His brother died, but Knut was reared by the zoo, with Doerflein
bottle-feeding him and strumming Elvis Presley songs for him on
his guitar.


Despite an impassioned debate over whether it is right to hand-
rear the cub, the zoo has vowed it will not kill the bear.


The little white ball of fur now has his own video podcast from
the zoo and a song has been written about him.


Annie Leibovitz, photographer to the stars, has already been to
the zoon to take Knut's portrait for an environmental campaign.
