Poland's unemployment rate fell in February to 14.9 percent,
reversing two months of rising joblessness, the national
statistics office said on Friday.


The rate compared with 18.0 percent in February 2006.


Unemployment in Poland fell gradually for most of last year, and
was down to 14.8 percent in November.


But the rate climbed back to 14.9 percent in December, and had
reached 15.1 percent by January this year.


Rising unemployment is frequent in the winter months, when demand
often falls in sectors such as construction which depend on good
weather conditions.


About 2.33 million Poles out of the population of 38.2 million
were unemployed at the end of February, the statistics office
said. A year earlier, the jobless total had been 2.87 million.


Poland, which joined the European Union in 2004, has the highest
unemployment rate in the 27-nation bloc.


In the EU as a whole, the rate was 7.5 percent in January, the
most recent month for which complete figures were available.
