Nepal's Maoists threatened Friday to retaliate against an ethnic
activist group blamed for the killing of 29 leftists if the
government fails to take action.


"If the government does not ban the MJF (Mahadhesi People's
Rights Forum) and take action against its leaders we will be
compelled to start retaliatory action," Maoist number-two Baburam
Bhatterai told thousands of supporters in the capital Kathmandu.


The leftists were apparently killed by ethnic activists in
clashes that have cast a shadow over the nation's peace process.


"We have not lost our patience at this critical moment, but if
the government stays quiet on this matter it will have to bear
the responsibility of the consequences," Bhatterai told a Maoist
memorial service Friday where 25 corpses were put on display.


At least 29 people were killed and dozens injured in the violence
in the town of Gaur, situated 90 kilometres (57 miles) south of
Kathmandu and near the border with India.


The Maoists have said that the unrest in the lowland Terai region
is part of efforts by monarchists to undermine Nepal's peace
process, a claim Bhatterai repeated Friday.


"Royalist forces are trying to derail the peace process and push
us back into war," said the Maoist's second-in-command.


The violence in the southern plains, known as Nepal's bread
basket, has cast a shadow over the Himalayan nation's peace deal,
which officially brought an end to 10 years of civil war between
Maoist rebels and the government.


The MJF has been pushing for greater representation in national
politics in the wake of the peace deal signed four months ago.


At least 60 people have been killed since the unrest began
earlier this year.
