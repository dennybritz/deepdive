A teenager was jailed for seven years on Friday for running amok
with a knife and wounding dozens of people at the opening
ceremony of Berlin's new central station.


A youth court in the German capital found the 17-year-old guilty
on 33 counts of attempted murder.


The court heard he had charged through the crowd, slashing
randomly at passers- by with a flick knife as darkness fell after
thousands of people had watched Chancellor Angela Merkel
inaugurate the high-tech one-billion-euro (1.33 -billion-dollar)
station in May.


The attack raised security concerns as it took place two weeks
before the football World Cup kicked off in Germany.


Some of the victims feared they had been infected with HIV-
positive blood because one of the first people stabbed has the
virus, but the fears proved unfounded.


Eight people received life-threatening wounds to the stomach,
lungs and kidneys and two were cut on the thighs, while others
suffered minor injuries.


The teenager insisted during the trial that he had no
recollection of carrying out the attack because had been drunk at
the time, and publicly apologised to the victims.


The station, near the Reichstag parliament building, is the
biggest in Europe.
