The Bulgarian couple of Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviski
successfully defended their ice dance title at the world figure
skating championships on Friday.


Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon of Canada finished
second, followed by the Turin Olympic silver medallist pair of
Tanith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto of the United States at third.


For Denkova and Staviski, the first Bulgarians to win the
category last year, it was their fourth podium finish, after they
took the bronze medal in 2003 and the silver in 2004.


The Bulgarians took top place after the original dance on
Thursday and held on for a total of 201.61 points.


Dubreuil and Lauzon, who had to be satisfied with the silver
medal last year, trailed the Bulgarians by only 0.2 points coming
into the free dance but finished on 200.46 points.


Belbin and Agosto received a total 195.43 points, while European
champions Isabelle Delobel and Olivier Schoenfelder of France,
who defeated Denkova and Staviski into third in Warsaw in
January, were fourth with 195.19 points.
