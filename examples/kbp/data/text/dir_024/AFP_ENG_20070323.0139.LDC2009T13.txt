A French magistrate has banned the head of French oil group
Total, Christophe de Margerie, from meeting former Iranian
president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his son, a judicial
source said on Friday.


The magistrate placed Margerie under formal investigation late on
Thursday on suspicion he had paid bribes to win a contract in
Iran.


The judicial control order also banned the Total chief from
meeting several other leading Iranian figures, the source said.


However, Margerie is free to fulfil his function as the chief
executive of Total.


The name of the former Iranian president's son, Mehdi Hashemi
Rafsanjani, has come to the attention of the investigating
magistrate, Philippe Courroye, as a result of a probe by
Norwegian authorities into Norwegian national oil company
Statoil.
