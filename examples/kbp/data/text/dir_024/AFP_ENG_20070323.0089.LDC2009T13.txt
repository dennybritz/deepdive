Philippine police were on the defensive Friday after gay cops
were warned they could be sacked for swinging their hips or
engaging in flamboyant behaviour.


"The Philippine national police does not have a policy that
discriminates against gays and lesbians. In short, all its
policies are issued for everybody regardless of sex or creed,"
police spokesman chief superintendent Samuel Pagdilao said.


But he warned that "being a uniformed service, there are rules of
conduct that apply to everybody for which violations may result
in administrative charges for conduct unbecoming."


Earlier in the week Pagdilao said gays in the police could be
fired if they "sway their hips while marching" or "engage in
lustful conduct."


Danton Remoto, of Ang Ladlad, a gay and lesbian group, said the
remarks "deepened the stereotype of gay men."


"His remarks will only force gay policemen back into the closet,"
he said.


Pagdilao told reporters he had never heard of any Philippine
policeman being gay anyway.
