He Zi handed China its fifth diving gold medal of the world
championships Friday by ending the reign of defending 1m
springboard champion Blythe Hartley of Canada who finished
second.


It was He's first major title after bursting onto the scene at
the Asian Games in December when she won a silver in the same
event.


Hartley, or "Muppet" as she is known in diving circles, had a
narrow lead after the opening three dives before He took the
initiative with a superb fourth dive that left her grinning.


The 16-year-old almost gave it away with her last dive, a one-
and-a-half somersault and one-and-a-half twist, as nerves took
hold but it was good enough to land her the title with 316.65
points.


Hartley, who also won the event at the 2001 world championships
in Japan, settled for silver with 311.20 points. Russia's Yulia
Pakhalina was third with 304.60 points.


China has now won all five diving gold medals here, matching its
total from the last world championships two years ago, with five
more medals still to be decided.
