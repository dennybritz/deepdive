Cricket's World Cup should be called off folowing the murder of
Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, retired South African bowling great
Allan Donald said on Friday.


Speaking to BBC Radio Five Live, Donald, who played under Woolmer
at county and national level and was a close friend, said that he
disagreed with the decision of the International Cricket Council
(ICC) to push ahead with the tournament in the Caribbean.


"I just don't know how this World Cup can continue under the
shadow of what's happened," he said. "World Cup 2007 will be
forever remembered for this."


Woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room in the Jamaican
capital Kingston on Sunday, a day after Pakistan had been knocked
out of the World Cup by Ireland, and was pronounced dead after
being taken to hospital.


Police announced on Thursday that the 58-year-old had been
strangled to death and have opened a murder investigation.


"My personal opinion would have been to stop, but knowing Bob he
would have wanted this to go ahead," Donald acknowledged..


"I think everyone will continue this World Cup but, at the back
of their minds, know that a tragedy took place."


"I just hope the individuals or individuals are brought to
justice because Bob was a great man and would never go to the
lengths to put his life in danger."
