Gunmen on Friday kidnapped a foreigner working for a German
construction company in southern Nigeria, police and industry
sources said.


"The man was taken early this morning around 7 am (0600 GMT) from
the Bilfinger Berger premises in Port Harcourt and taken to an
unknown location," Felix Ogbaudu, police commissioner for Rivers
State, told AFP.


A military officer in the region, which is the hub of Nigeria's
oil industry, confirmed the abduction, while a spokesman at the
German headquarters of Bilfinger Berger AG, Sascha Bamberger,
told AFP he was so far unaware of any such incident.


This latest kidnapping brings to three the number of foreigners
currently held by armed groups in southern Nigeria.


Two Chinese nationals were abducted on March 17 in the
southeastern state of Anambra.


Since the start of this year about 60 foreigners, most of them
with links to the oil industry, have been kidnapped in Nigeria,
as many as were abducted during the whole of 2006.
