A police station in the eastern border town of Mutare in Zimbabwe
has been petrol bombed by suspected Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC) youths, authorities said Friday.


Nobody was injured in the attack which occurred at around 0100
GMT.


"Suspected MDC youths have petrol bombed an office at Sakubva
police station," police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said in a
statement.


"The suspects cut a security fence and sprinkled some petrol
using a galvanised pipe."


Bvudzijena told AFP police suspected the pipe was used to pour
petrol into the bottle used.


The suspects threw the petrol bomb at a three-office module block
housing the Victim Friendly Unit and the Community Relations
Liaison officers, damaging four bicycles, two typewriters, legal
files and stationery.


He added that officers at the station eventually put out the
fire.


"About 30 minutes prior to the incident, a police officer who was
proceeding to the station was confronted by a group of about ten
youths who called names at him, accusing the police of being used
by government," Bvudzijena said.


"The officer fired a shot in the air scaring the youths away."


"Assailants who use petrol bombs or any form of violence will
encounter the necessary force from the police during the
commission of such offences," he added.


On Wednesday last week, two policewomen sustained facial burns
and were in a serious condition in a Harare hospital following a
firebomb attack in the Zimbabwean capital by suspected opposition
activists.
