Greece's embassy in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital was
hit by a shell during clashes between rival political factions,
causing damage but no injuries, the Greek foreign ministry said
on Friday.


"All personnel is safe... the shell does not appear to have been
specifically targeted at our embassy," a ministry official told
AFP.


The incident happened on Thursday evening, when the embassy was
closed.


The shell smashed windows and damaged the embassy interior, the
official said.


The Greek embassy is located in a bloc of offices which also
houses the Spanish embassy and UNICEF staff, she added.


A second shell hit another part of the building.


The Greek government is in contact with the United Nations and
other European Union states on its future course of action, but
the situation seems to be calming, the ministry official said.


"We are closely monitoring the situation, there does not appear
to be an immediate need for evacuation," she said.


Fighting erupted on Thursday between government troops and guards
for former vice president and defeated presidential candidate
Jean-Pierre Bemba and continued for a second day on Friday.


"The fighting is relentless, someone should send an airplane to
get us out of here," a Greek woman identified as a Kinshasa
resident told Net state television.


The United Nations peacekeeping force in the DRC has already
evacuated over six hundred people from Kinshasa caught up in
fierce fighting on Thursday.
