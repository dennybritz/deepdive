Two Peruvians were each jailed for five years Friday in Cambodia
for trying to smuggle two kilograms (four pounds) of cocaine to
Thailand.


Eduardo Rosales Ruiz, 27, and 19-year-old Silvia Nelida Gomez
Ramirez were arrested last September as they got off a plane in
the capital Phnom Penh, after Cambodian authorities were tipped
off by US police.


The pair were found to have swallowed a total of 248 packets of
cocaine, municipal court judge Ke Sakhorn said.


"The two suspects smuggled cocaine," he said.


The defendants told the court Friday they were to be paid 4,000
US dollars each for smuggling the drug from Peru to Thailand, and
had hoped to cross the border with Cambodia overland.


At the time they made the deal in Peru, the pair did not know
they would be smuggling cocaine, they said.


"I didn't know it was a drug until the police arrested me," Ruiz
told the court.


"I knew it was something illegal, but I didn't know what it was,"
he added.


Ramirez said this was the second time she had smuggled drugs
across borders, having done so once before in South America. She
said she needed the money to continue her studies.


The pair were also fined 2,500 dollars each.


Two other Peruvians were arrested last October after being caught
trying to smuggle cocaine from Cambodia to Thailand.


Impoverished Cambodia is becoming an increasingly popular
trafficking point for narcotics, particularly methamphetamines
and heroin, after neighbouring Thailand toughened its stance on
illegal drugs in 2002.
