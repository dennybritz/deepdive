Thailand's military-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont is
set to visit Japan next month, when he could sign a free trade
deal, the government spokesman said Friday.


Japanese ambassador Hideaki Kobayashi met with Surayud at his
office Friday to plan the April 2-5 trip, which will include a
bilateral meeting with his counterpart Shinzo Abe, the spokesman
said.


The two could sign a free-trade deal that has been in limbo since
the military seized power in Bangkok in September, if Thailand's
cabinet gives its approval next week, spokesman Yongyuth Mayalarp
told reporters.


"The prime minister told the Japanese ambassador that signing the
free trade agreement would depend on the outcome of Tuesday's
cabinet meeting on the matter," Yongyuth told reporters.


Negotiations on the deal were completed last year, and former
prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra had been set to sign it in
September.


After the coup, activists raised new concerns about provisions
that would allow Japan to send toxic waste to Thailand and to
patent genetically modified micro- organisms.


The cabinet could decide Tuesday to approve the original deal
that had been negotiated under Thaksin's government.


Yongyuth said Surayud would also use the visit to reassure Japan,
the biggest foreign investor in Thailand, that the military would
hold elections by the end of the year.


Surayud is set to leave Bangkok on April 2, and to meet with Abe
on April 3. He is due to have an audience with Japan's imperial
couple on April 5.
