A US plan to deploy an anti-missile defence system in eastern
Europe against potential attacks from Iran threatens Russia and
undermines cooperation in the United Nations, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday.


"If our Western partners are deploying elements of the US
national anti-missile defence system on the pretext of an
'Iranian threat'... then what's the point of the UN Security
Council?" Lavrov wrote in the Moskovskiye Novosti newspaper.


"I hope our American partners think about this, especially as
they are calling on us to fight a hypothetical threat while
creating a real threat to our security," Lavrov wrote.


Washington says it wants to deploy the anti-missile shield in
Poland, the Czech Republic and in the southern Caucasus to guard
Europe against potential threats from states such as Iran and
North Korea.


US officials say the system would not be aimed at Russia and
would in any case soon be overwhelmed in an assault by Russia's
vast missile arsenal.


Russia and the United States are both permanent members of the UN
Security Council, which is expected to vote Saturday on a draft
resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran.
