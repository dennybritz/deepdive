Japan said Friday it will open a new inquiry to examine any links
between the blockbuster flu medicine Tamiflu and abnormal
behaviour among users following a spate of recent teenage deaths.


"We need to go over it again as accidents involving young people
occurred quite often," Health Minister Hakuo Yanagisawa told
reporters.


Japan has previously said that there is no clear evidence of a
causal link between Tamiflu and the incidents.


But it said it would review its position after ordering the
importer of Tamiflu to warn doctors that teenagers should not be
prescribed the drug.


It follows more than a dozen cases of young people jumping from
buildings after being prescribed the drug. In a recent case, a 14
-year-old boy leapt to his death last month from the 11th floor
of an apartment block.


Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, which makes the anti-flu
medicine, has repeatedly denied any connection between the
incidents and its drug, which is often prescribed for seasonal
flu.


Tokyo buys more than 60 percent of the world's supply of Tamiflu,
which is also considered a frontline drug against a potential
pandemic of bird flu or other forms of influenza.
