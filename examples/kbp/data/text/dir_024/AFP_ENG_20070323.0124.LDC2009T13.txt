A suicide car bomb exploded near a NATO convoy in eastern
Afghanistan Friday, killing only the attacker and wounding a
child, officials said.


NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said it
suffered no casualties in the attack, about 3O kilometres (20
miles) outside the eastern city of Jalalabad.


"One civilian child has been wounded in the blast," a district
governor, Khaibar Mohmand, told AFP.


Mohmand blamed the attack on the Taliban, who have waged a bloody
insurgency since their ouster from government in late 2001 in a
US-led offensive.


The attack was on the same road as one on March 4 that struck a
convoy of US forces. The troops, who said they were also shot at,
opened fire afterwards. Eight civilians were killed.


The Taliban have vowed a new wave of suicide bombings this year
after around 150 in 2006, according to figures released by the
British government this week, which said the number was six times
higher than in the previous year.


This year has already seen some of Afghanistan's deadliest
suicide attacks.


More than 20 people, including two Americans and a South Korean
soldier, were killed February 27 when a suicide bomber blew
himself up among a crowd of people trying to enter a US base near
Kabul being visited by US Vice President Dick Cheney.
