Chery Automobile said Friday it would set up an assembly plant in
Uruguay in a joint venture with an Argentinian firm, becoming the
first Chinese company to set up a car factory in South America.


Chery will hold a 51-percent share in the venture while
Argentina's SOCMA Group, the current owner of the plant, will
have 49 percent, the Chinese car maker's spokesman, Wang Chao,
told AFP.


Wang said the deal would make Chery the first Chinese company to
invest in a car factory in South America.


Wang declined to provide any financial details about the deal but
a source with SOCMA told AFP in November that the investment
could reach 100 million dollars.


Wang said the plant was expected to have an annual capacity of
25,000 vehicles in 2008, with trial production to start in the
second half of this year.


The first model to be produced in the plant will be a Tiggo,
Chery's first sport utility vehicle, with Argentina targeted as
the main market.


Wang said Chery, which is based in Wuhu in the eastern province
of Anhui, had already set up six assembly plants in the key
markets of Russia, Egypt, Iran, Indonesia and Ukraine.
