Qin Kai won the men's 3m springboard world title here Friday,
halting defending champion Alexandre Despatie's bid to end
China's domination of the diving medals.


Qin scored 545.35 points to the Canadian's 518.65 with Dmitri
Sautin of Russia third with 517.10.


China has now won all six diving titles at the World Swimming
Championships so far with four more still to be contested. It
surpasses the disappointing five they won at the last
championships two years ago in Montreal.


World number one He Chong of China, expected to challenge for the
title, ended sixth after a poorly performed fourth dive put him
out of contention.


Despatie had been confident of beating the Chinese pair after
finishing top in qualifying.
