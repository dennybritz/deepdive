Australia won their second consecutive women's 4x100m medley
relay world title Saturday, dominating three of the four legs to
shatter their own world record.


There was little separating the top three teams in the backstroke
leg, with American star Natalie Coughlin having a narrow lead
over Reiko Nakamura for Japan and Emily Seebohm, just 14, for
Australia.


The final result became clear though when 100m breaststroke
champion Leisel Jones entered the water as she powered away from
her nearest rival Tara Kirk to give Australia a half body length
lead going into the butterfly leg.


Jessicah Schipper, the 100m butterfly silver medallist, extended
Australia's lead and handed over to anchor Lisbeth Lenton 0.52
seconds under world record pace and the 100m freestyle world
champion raced home in 3:55.74.


It was the fourth gold medal of the championships for Lenton and
the third for Jones.


"That is actually the best relay team I've ever been a part of,"
said Jones.


"I'm happy with that swim. Three golds, there's no pressure on me
for the 50m (breaststroke final on Sunday).


"We had a blast. We went in as underdogs in lane 5 and just had
fun."


Lenton echoed Jones's sentiments, saying they were relaxed and
just enjoying being together as a team.


"It's so much fun to be a part of. We've had a great meet and I
really wanted to go out there and celebrate," she said.
