US President George W. Bush on Friday apologized to wounded US
troops for grim conditions some of them faced at the Washington-
area hospital that has treated many injured Iraq veterans.


"It is not right to have someone volunteer to wear our uniform
and not get the best possible care. I apologize for what they
went through, and we're going to fix the problem," he said at the
Walter Reed Army Medical Center.


It was Bush's first visit to the hospital since the Washington
Post detailed in February how convalescing soldiers at Walter
Reed were left to fend for themselves in a maze of bureaucracy.


The Post also found severely wounded soldiers living in a
building with moldy walls, infestations of mice and roaches, and
holes in the ceiling.


Other soldiers and family members told how case managers lost
track of the wounded soldiers once they became outpatients, and
left them to navigate mountains of paperwork and other
bureaucratic requirements to get discharged from the military
with disability benefits.


The scandal led to the firing of army secretary Francis Harvey
and hospital commander Major General George Weightman.


"The system failed you, and it failed our troops. And we're going
to fix it," Bush said after his three-hour tour, describing
himself as "disturbed" after talking to some of the soldiers who
had been housed in the dilapidated building.
