At least two Japanese soldiers were killed when their CH-47
Chinook transport helicopter crashed on a small island in the
south of the country, police said Saturday.


The wreckage of the helicopter, which crashed late Friday, was
found overnight on a mountainside on Tokunoshima, an isle north
of the main Okinawan island.


Two crewmen were confirmed dead on arrival at an area hospital
while another suffered severe burns, a spokesman for Kagoshima
prefectural police said by telephone. The fate of a fourth crew
member was not immediately known.


The heavy-lift helicopter was on its way from Naha, the main city
of Okinawa, to Tokunoshima on an emergency medical mission to
pick up a patient, the spokesman said.


"Islanders reported an explosive sound and a fire on the mountain
shortly before midnight. There was dense fog and wind at that
time," he added. "We are investigating the cause of the
accident."
