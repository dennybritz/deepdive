Iranian authorities have begun legal proceedings against
Britain's seized naval personnel and they will be punished if
found guilty, Iran's ambassador to Moscow said in comments
distributed on Saturday.


"No kind of apology has been received from the British side and
as a result the case has taken on a juridical form," Ambassador
Gholamreza Ansari told Vesti television in comments quoted on the
channel's Internet site.


"If their guilt is really demonstrated, naturally it will result
in punishment. I want to underline that legal proceedings have
already begun," said Ansari.


Tehran has so far refused to bow to mounting world pressure to
release the Britons it says illegally entered Iran's territorial
waters. London insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling
patrol in Iraqi waters.


The crisis escalated after Iran aired new television footage on
Friday of a British sailor "confessing" to trespassing in its
waters and apologising.
