Britain's Foreign Office said Saturday it was pursuing a "formal
discussion" with Iran after it lodged an official protest over
televised footage of British sailors seized in the northern Gulf.


"We are pursuing a formal discussion," a spokesman told AFP. This
generally means an exchange of letters, although the spokeswoman
would not comment further on the nature of the discussion.


On Thursday, Geoffrey Adams, Britain's ambassador to Tehran, met
Iranian foreign ministry officials to protest about Iranian
television pictures of Leading Seaman Faye Turney, 26, the only
female captive.


Adams also demanded the immediate release of the 15 as well as
information about where they were and consular access.


The footage showed Turney wearing a black headscarf and saying:
"Obviously we trespassed in the waters."


New video footage was aired Friday showing another member of the
group, Nathan Summers, apparently saying: "I deeply apologise for
entering your waters."


Prime Minister Tony Blair has voiced "disgust" at the footage,
while Summers' father Roy said he thought he was reading from a
script.


"That wasn't my son talking," the father told the Sun newspaper.
