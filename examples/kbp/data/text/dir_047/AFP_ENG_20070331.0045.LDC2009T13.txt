The United States won the women's water polo gold medal Saturday
with a fiercely fought 6-5 victory over Australia.


The match was a gruelling battle of defences, with both
goalkeepers playing crucial roles and neither side leading by
more than a goal at any stage.


The result continued a tradition of close matches in major games
between the two nations.


Australia beat the US 4-3 in the final of the Sydney Olympics in
2000 to claim gold, while the US won 6-5 in the bronze medal
decider at the Athens Olympics in 2004.


"We lost in overtime in Montreal two years ago, we won in 2003
(at the world championships in Barcelona), and this is our third
straight finals in the championships," said US coach Guy Baker.


"It feels real good. We knew we were going to cry one way or
another.


"It's always an electric match when we play Australia."


Russia beat Hungary 9-8 to claim the bronze medal.
