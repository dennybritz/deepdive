Pakistan on Saturday successfully test-fired its short-range
nuclear-capable surface-to-surface ballistic missile, the
military announced.


The Hatf II Abdali missile has a range of 200 kilometers (125
miles) and "can carry all types of warheads," the military said
in a statement.


The test, aimed at "validation of the desired technical
parameters," was a success, it added.


Last week, Pakistan tested a longer range version of its nuclear-
capable, radar- dodging cruise missile, the Hatf VII Babur. It
has a range of 700 kilometres.


Pakistan and India have routinely conducted missile tests since
the nuclear- armed South Asian rivals carried out tit-for-tat
nuclear detonations in May 1998.


However in 2004 they launched a slow-moving peace process aimed
at ending six decades of hostility and resolving their dispute
over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, the cause of two of
their three wars.


In February, Pakistan signed a historic deal with India to cut
the risk of atomic weapons accidents.
