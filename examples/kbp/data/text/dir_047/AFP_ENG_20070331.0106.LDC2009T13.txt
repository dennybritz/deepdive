Spain is predicting annual economic growth of more than three
percent until 2010, an official report obtained by AFP Saturday
said.


Spain's growth is one of the highest in the euro zone, reaching
3.9 percent last year.


The report of the economy ministry forecast growth of 3.4 percent
this year, 3.3 percent next year and 2009, and 3.1 percent in
2010.


The 2007 figure is slightly down on the 3.5 percent predicted by
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero at the end of
February.
