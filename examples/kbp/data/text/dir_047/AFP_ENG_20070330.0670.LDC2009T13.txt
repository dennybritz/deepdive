A US military tribunal Friday handed down a nine-month prison
sentence to Australian David Hicks on a charge of supporting
terrorism, a military judge said.


In the first conviction by the controversial Guantanamo military
tribunals and the first conviction in a US war crimes trial since
World War II, a panel of military officers had recommended a
maximum sentence of seven years.


But judge Colonel Ralph Kohlmann revealed that a plea deal for
Hicks required that "any portion of a sentence in excess of nine
months" be suspended.


As a result, Hicks will be transferred to Australia within two
months -- as stipulated by the plea bargain agreement -- and will
likely be a free man by the new year after more than five years
at the Guantanamo detention camp.


The United States had come under heavy lobbying from Australia's
conservative government, which had been accused of failing to
protect the interests of one of its citizens.


Hicks, who kept a stoic expression when the judge announced the
result, earlier pleaded guilty for attending Al-Qaeda training
camps and volunteering to fight in support of the Taliban regime
during the US-led invasion of Afghanistan.


In a statement read out by his lawyer, Hicks apologized to his
family, Australia and the United States for his actions.


Under the plea deal, Hicks agreed to withdraw allegations he had
been abused at the hands US personnel and is prohibited from
speaking to the media for a year about the case.
