Four Croatian doctors are under investigation for allegations of
illegally removing eggs from women undergoing infertility
treatment at a Zagreb clinic, prosecutors here said on Friday.


The four are suspected of removing eggs without the consent of
the patients undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) between
2000-2002 and then using them with five other women, the
prosecutors' statement said.


"They did this ... knowing that this method was not permitted
under Croatian law," the statement added.


The four suspects were not named by prosecutors.


Eggs can sell for up to 1,000 euros (1,400 dollars) on the
Croatian black market.


In early 2005 it emerged that 500 frozen embryos had disappeared
from a Zagreb clinic.


Medical sources said between 2,000 and 3,000 Croatian women
suffer from infertility and are potential candidates for IVF
treatment.


Due to the high number of failures with IVF, many attempts are
often necessary before a pregnancy succeeds.
