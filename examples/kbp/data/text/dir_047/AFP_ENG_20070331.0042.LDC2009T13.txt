A memorial service will be held for murdered Pakistan cricket
coach Bob Woolmer in the eastern city of Lahore on Sunday, a
Pakistan Cricket Board official said.


The service will be held at Sacred Heart Cathedral to pay tribute
"to the  great services Woolmer rendered to Pakistan cricket,"
board director of communication Ahsan Malik told AFP on Saturday.


Woolmer was found strangled in his Jamaican hotel room on March
18, one day after Pakistan were dramatically ousted from the
cricket World Cup following a defeat to minnows Ireland.


His death has shocked the international cricket community and
left Pakistan cricket fans and the team reeling amid speculation
over who might have been responsible for his death.


The one-hour memorial service would start at 12:00 pm (0700 GMT)
and would be open to anyone who wished to pay their respects to
Woolmer, Malik said.


President Pervez Musharraf in his condolence message to Woolmer's
family paid tribute to the national coach.


"Bob Woolmer's services to the game will be long remembered by
cricket fans," Musharraf said after the death.


Woolmer, 58, became Pakistan coach in 2004 and earned respect
from many Pakistanis.


The death of Woolmer, also a former coach of South Africa, has
sparked one of the most complex murder investigations in Jamaican
history.


It also triggered speculation about possible links to match-
fixing and illegal betting in cricket.


Around 50 officers are attempting to track down hundreds of
potential witnesses who were either visiting or staying at
Kingston's Pegasus Hotel in the days leading up to Woolmer's
death.
