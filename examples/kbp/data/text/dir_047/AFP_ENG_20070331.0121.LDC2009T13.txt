The death toll from a suicide truck bombing in the northern Iraqi
town of Tal Afar this week has risen to 152 with more than 340
people wounded, an interior ministry official said Saturday.


The official confirmed to AFP that 152 people were killed --
nearly double the 85 deaths initially announced -- and another
347 wounded in the blast, which triggered deadly reprisal
killings of at least 70 Sunni Arabs.


Eighteen policemen have been re-arrested in connection with the
shooting rampage carried out in revenge in Tal Afar after a group
of detained officers were initially released to mourn their
Shiite relatives killed in the blast.


The Tal Afar killings were the worst bout of communal
bloodletting in recent months in Iraq and in the town since US
President George W. Bush last March hailed it as a model for
coalition efforts to build a new Iraq.


The Iraqi government, which has been accused of being at least
complicit in sectarian violence, has vowed that the shooting
culprits will be put on trial and has ordered interior and
defence ministry officials to probe the violence.
