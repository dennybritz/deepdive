The death toll from a suicide truck bombing in the northern Iraqi
town of Tal Afar this week has risen to 152 with more than 340
people wounded, an interior ministry official said Saturday.


The official confirmed to AFP that 152 people were killed --
nearly double the 85 deaths initially announced -- and another
347 wounded in the blast, which triggered deadly reprisal
killings of at least 70 Sunni Arabs.
