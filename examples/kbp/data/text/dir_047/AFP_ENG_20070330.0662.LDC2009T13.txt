A US military tribunal Friday gave Australian David Hicks a
prison sentence of nine months for a charge of supporting
terrorism, a military judge said.


After a panel of military officers recommended a maximum sentence
of seven years, judge Colonel Ralph Kohlmann revealed that a plea
deal for Hicks required that "any portion of a sentence in excess
of nine months" be suspended. He is to serve the sentence in
Australia.
