Spanish authorities uncovered more than 100 kilos (220 pounds) of
explosives in Spain's northern province of Navarra during a drive
against the Basque separatist ETA movement, press reports said
Saturday.


The Europa Press news agency said police had searched an
apartment in the town of Berriozar overnight during an operation
which began Wednesday when eight people were arrested and bomb-
making material found.


The Civil Guard police would not confirm the latest reports
Saturday but confirmed that operations were still under way.


Those arrested included Jose Angel Lerin Sanchez, 35, a suspected
member of Basque separatist group ETA, who has been on the run
since 2005 and was allegedly setting up a new "commando" unit.


The armed Basque separatist movement is blamed for 819 deaths in
its 38-year campaign to win independence for the region. Both the
European Union and the US State Department consider ETA a
terrorist organisation.


The group declared a permanent ceasefire a year ago, but it was
shattered by a truck bomb blast on December 30 which killed two
men at Madrid's international airport.


The attack led Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to
break off all contact with the militants.


Batasuna, ETA's banned political wing, announced earlier this
week it was forming a new political party to contest local
elections. But a Spanish court ruled on Friday that the party
cannot hold a meeting this weekend to unveil its platform.
