Four Japanese soldiers were killed when their CH-47 Chinook
transport helicopter crashed on a small island in the south of
the country, police said Saturday.


The wreckage of the helicopter, which crashed late Friday, was
found overnight on a mountainside on Tokunoshima, an isle north
of the main Okinawan island.


"Two of the four crewmen on board were confirmed dead immediately
after they were found in the burned debris and the bodies of two
others were later recovered in the area," a spokesman for
Tokunoshima police said by telephone.


Earlier reports suggested one of the crewmen had survived but had
suffered severe burns.


The heavy-lift helicopter was on its way from Naha, the main city
of Okinawa, to Tokunoshima on an emergency medical mission to
pick up a patient, a spokesman for Kagoshima prefectural police
said earlier.


"Islanders reported an explosive sound and a fire on the mountain
shortly before midnight. There was dense fog and wind at that
time," he added. "We are investigating the cause of the
accident."
