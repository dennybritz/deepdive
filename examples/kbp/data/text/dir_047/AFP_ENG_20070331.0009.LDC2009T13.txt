Policemen suspected of killing 70 Sunni Arabs in Iraq this week
have been rearrested after being freed to mourn their relatives
killed in a truck bombing in the same town, police said on
Saturday.


On Tuesday, gunmen believed to off-duty policemen, went on a
rampage killing Sunni Arabs in the town of Tal Afar after a truck
bomb killed 85 people in a Shiite district.


A group of policemen was briefly detained but later released to
mourn the deaths of their relatives from the suicide truck
bombing.


The chief of police in Mosul, the capital city of Nineveh
province that is home to Tal Afar, told AFP that 18 policemen
have been taken into custody again for further interrogation.


"We have taken into custody the 18 policemen who are suspects in
the revengeful sectarian murders after the bombing," said Wathik
al-Hamdani.


"They were released earlier and have been rearrested now. They
are in custody of Nineveh police and investigations are on."


The Tal Afar killings were the worst bout of communal
bloodletting in recent months in Iraq and in the town since US
President George W. Bush last March hailed it as a model for
coalition efforts to build a new Iraq.
