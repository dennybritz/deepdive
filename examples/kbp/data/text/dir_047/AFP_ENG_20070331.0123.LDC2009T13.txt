Iraqi Justice Minister Hashim al-Shibli told AFP on Saturday he
was resigning over differences with the Iraqi National List, the
political grouping he represents in parliament.


"I have submitted my resignation owing to political differences
with the Iraqi List, who nominated me to this post, and owing to
political differences with the government," he said by telephone.


"I find I do not wish to be responsible during this time in Iraqi
history, therefore I submitted my resignation," he added, adding
no further details.


The Iraqi National List, which is headed by former prime minister
Ayad Allawi, is a secular nationalist alliance made up of Sunnis
and Shiites. It has 25 seats in the 275-member parliament.


On March 4, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said he expected to
reshuffle his 39-member coalition cabinet of Shiites, Sunnis and
Kurds within two weeks, although it was unclear whether Shibli
had been due to loose his job.
