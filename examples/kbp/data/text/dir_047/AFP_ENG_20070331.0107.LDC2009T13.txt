Britain has responded by diplomatic note to Iran's capture of 15
British naval personnel in the Gulf last week, Foreign Minister
Margaret Beckett said Saturday.


"We had a diplomatic note and we have made our response," she
told reporters in Bremen, Germany, without giving details.


An earlier diplomatic note from Iran to British authorities
released Friday condemned the "illegal act" by British naval
staff in the Gulf but did not call for an apology.
