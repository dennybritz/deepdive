Rescuers on Saturday recovered about 70 fishermen from an ice
floe that broke away from Russia's far eastern coast in high
winds near Vladivostok, the RIA- Novosti news agency reported.


The rescuers used a hovercraft to bring a first group of 30
people back to the mainland but high waves prevented another
hovercraft returning and it had to disembark its payload of 10
fishermen on an island for recovery later, RIA- Novosti quoted an
emergencies ministry spokesman as saying.


The remaining 30 were being brought back to port by boat, the
spokesman said.


Fishing through holes drilled in the ice remains a time-honoured
tradition in Russia, one that is usually accompanied by liberal
doses of vodka or other strong home-made drink.


Authorities routinely issue warnings about the risks, but these
are widely ignored.


Just a week ago 280 fisherman had to be rescued from drifting ice
in the same area.


Sea temperatures are such that anyone falling into the water is
unlikely to last more than eight minutes, experts warn.


"As the ice in the Amur Gulf is very fragile the Primorsky
province's rescue personnel and equipment are on high alert," the
spokesman for the local branch of the emergency situations
ministry said.
