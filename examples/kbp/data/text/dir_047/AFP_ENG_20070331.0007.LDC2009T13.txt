A Buddhist man was shot dead by suspected Islamic militants and
three others were injured in two separate attacks in Thailand's
Muslim-majority south, police said Saturday.


A 49-year-old man was gunned down late Friday in front of his
house by two people on a motorcycle in Pattani, one of three
insurgency-torn provinces bordering Malaysia, police said.


Elsewhere, a 37-year-old Buddhist was injured Saturday in a
drive-by shooting in neighbouring Yala province. A Buddhist
couple was also wounded in a small roadside bomb explosion in the
province.


More than 2,000 people have been killed since separatist violence
erupted three years ago in the south. The violence has worsened
since a September coup, despite a series of peace initiatives by
the army-installed government.
