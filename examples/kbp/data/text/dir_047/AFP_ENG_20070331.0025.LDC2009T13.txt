Russia denied on Saturday that it was ready to let the United
States place part of its controversial missile defence shield on
Russian territory.


Foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said in a statement
that such reports "do not accord with reality and absolutely do
not reflect Russia's position on the problem of missile defence."


His statement came after a foreign ministry official said
anonymously on Friday that Russia would consider allowing the
deployment on its territory of elements of a collective missile
defence shield for the European continent, with US participation.


Russia has strongly objected to a US plan to install parts of an
anti-missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, a plan that
Washington says is needed to protect against attack by Iran or
North Korea.


Both the Czech Republic and Poland were under Moscow's control in
Soviet times but they are now members of the NATO military
alliance and have said that Russia has no say in their security
arrangements.
