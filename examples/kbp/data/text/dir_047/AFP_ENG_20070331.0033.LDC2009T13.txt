Three car bombs and a roadside bomb killed 14 people and wounded
dozens as Iraq's relentless insurgency and sectarian violence
continued on Saturday, security officials said.


Five people were killed and 15 wounded when a car bomb exploded
outside Al-Sadr hospital in Baghdad's Shiite enclave of Sadr
City.


The district is a favourite target of Sunni extremists in the
ongoing sectarian conflict with Shiites.


A second car bomb killed four people, including two policemen and
wounded 20, including many policemen, near a service station in
the central Shiite city of Hilla, police said.


They were guarding the fuel station when the bomb exploded, also
destroying 10 cars that were waiting for petrol.


In the town of Tuz Khurmatu, near the northern oil hub of Kirkuk,
another two civilians were killed and 11 wounded when a car bomb
exploded in a central square, local police chief Abbas Mohammed
Amin said.


In the largely Shiite town of Suweira, south of Baghdad, three
civilians were killed and seven wounded in a roadside bomb
explosion as shoppers were busy making weekend purchases, police
said.


Insurgents have carried out massive attacks across Iraq this
week, killing more than 400 people in the past four days alone.
