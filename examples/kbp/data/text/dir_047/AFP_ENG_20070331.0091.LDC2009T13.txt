The Rhine river, part of Europe's main inland waterway, was open
again Saturday after being blocked for nearly a week since
shipping containers fell off a barge, officials said in Cologne.


A total of 32 containers slid into the Rhine from the ship as it
attempted to negotiate a sharp turn in the river on Sunday.


Most were recovered over the next few days but four were still on
the river bed as the Rhine reopened to traffic. Some 500 vessels
were held up by the accident.


The Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam in the
Netherlands and is connected by canal to the Danube river, which
empties into the Black Sea.
