American Margaret Hoelzer swam a championship record to dethrone
defending champion Kirsty Coventry in the women's 200-metres
backstroke final at the world championships Saturday.


Hoelzer finally broke through after silver medals at the 2003
Barcelona championships and Montreal two years ago to win in two
minutes 07.16 seconds.


She carved 24-100ths of a second off China's He Cihong's race
record set at the Rome championships in 1994.


"It's exciting to get past that second place and to finally see
what that it feels like to win, Hoelzer said.


"I don't know if I'm more excited about that or about getting a
best time after three years."


Reiko Nakamura of Japan won the bronze.
