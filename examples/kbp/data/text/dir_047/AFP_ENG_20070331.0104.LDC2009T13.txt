Iran on Saturday denied reports that it planned to keep its
controversial atomic programme secret, insisting the nuclear work
would continue under the supervision of the UN watchdog.


"Inspections and cooperation will go on with no change or halt,"
Iran's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency,
Ali Asghar Soltanieh, told state radio.


"All Iranian (nuclear) activities including enrichment are under
IAEA inspectors' supervision and there is no problem," he said,
asked whether Iran would "refrain from presenting information to
the IAEA".
