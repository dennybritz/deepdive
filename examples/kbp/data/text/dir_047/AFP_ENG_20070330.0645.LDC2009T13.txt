A spectacular fire was raging Friday in the hills northwest of
Los Angeles just 500 meters (yards) from the fabled white
HOLLYWOOD sign, a symbol of the sprawling megacity.


The brushfire was burning close to Universal and Warner studios
and Griffith park, a steep sloped area between Los Angeles and
the heavily residential San Fernando valley to the northwest. A
huge cloud of smoke over the affected area could be seen from
miles around.


Firefighters dispatched five helicopters to try to control the
blaze, spokesman Ron Myers told KFWB radio.


The cause of the fire was not immediately known, and there were
no immediate reports of any injuries.


Los Angeles is going through a dry spell: it has received 6.3
centimeters (2.5 inches) in precipitation since January 1 -- 10
times less than normal, in the first part of the year which tends
to be rainier.
