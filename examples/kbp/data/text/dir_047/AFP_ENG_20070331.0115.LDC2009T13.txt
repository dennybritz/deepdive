Austrian police are calling for light beer to be served in
plastic cups to avoid potential injuries to fans during next
year's European football championships being co-hosted with
Switzerland.


Police spokesman Peter Jedelsky said they wanted drinks with
reduced levels of alcohol to be served in stadiums.


"We've already been in contact with the beer industry concerning
light beer," Jedelsky said Saturday.


Jedelsky said that they were also looking for private security
firms to be called in as reinforcements for the duration of the
June 7 to 29 tournament.


"It's not just a question of patrolling stadiums but keeping an
eye on all areas where fans gather in groups from camp sites to
shops in petrol stations," he said.


"We have to protect against thiefs and money fraudsters who
operate in stadiums but make up just five percent of fans," added
Jedelsky.
