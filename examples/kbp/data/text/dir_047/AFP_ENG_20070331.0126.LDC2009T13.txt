Six Japanese military officers arrived in Nepal's capital on
Saturday to monitor the country's ceasefire, a statement said,
marking the latest overseas mission for officially pacifist
Tokyo.


The six unarmed personnel will join the United Nations Mission in
Nepal (UNMIN), the body set up to monitor former rebel weapons
and soldiers and assist with crucial elections slated to take
place before June.


"It is expected that the dispatch will greatly contribute to
further strengthening the bilateral relations between Japan and
Nepal as assistance to the peace-building efforts in Nepal," a
Japanese embassy statement said.


Nepal's Maoists and government signed a peace deal late last year
that ended a bloody civil war that killed at least 13,000 people.


It is the first mission since Japan created a full-fledged
defence ministry in January, upgrading its Defence Agency set up
after defeat in World War II.


Japan has been slowly expanding its military operations overseas
and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to rewrite the pacifist
US-imposed 1947 constitution.


Japan is a major donor to aid-dependent Nepal.
