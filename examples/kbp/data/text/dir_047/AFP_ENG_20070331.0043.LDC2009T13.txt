A woman was shot dead at an airport in this southern German city
on Saturday as she was about to board a flight, a police
spokesman said.


Police said a man arrested in a car park of the airport shortly
after the shooting had been in a relationship with the woman.


The shooting took place at about 6:00 am (0400 GMT) when the
airport was relatively quiet.


The scene of the crime was sealed off and passengers were
directed to another part of the airport, which is the 10th
biggest in Germany.
