Mexico's Lorena Ochoa shrugged off a double bogey to post a
second-round 71 here Friday and seize a share of the lead with
Paula Creamer in the Kraft Nabisco Championship.


Ochoa, the 2006 LPGA Player of the Year who could supplant Annika
Sorenstam as world No. 1 by capturing her first major title here
this week, started the day one shot off the lead.


Her round included five birdies along with two bogeys and the
double bogey at 15 and gave her a two-round total of 140.


"I'm really happy being 4-under right now," Ochoa said. "I
started on the back nine, and I was trying to get into the
rhythm, hitting my driver, one left, one right. I didn't really
know what to do.


"So I made one double bogey and two bogeys, so just being able to
finish under par on this course really makes me feel good. The
only thing that was important was being in a good position for
the weekend, good position for tomorrow. I'm in a good position."


Creamer fired a 67 to join Ochoa atop the leaderboard.


The 20-year-old American had five birdies in her bogey-free
round.


The pair had a one-shot lead over first-round leader Shi Hyun Ahn
of South Korea (73) and Norway's Suzann Petersen (69).


South Korean Se Ri Pak fired a 70 for 142.


Swedish superstar Sorenstam, however, continued to struggle,
carding a 76 for a seven-over total of 151, while defending
champion Karrie Webb of Australia ballooned to a 77 that put her
at 147.
