Defending champion Stuart Appleby had a lot of company at the top
of the leaderboard on Friday as half a dozen players shared the
halfway lead in the 5.5 million-dollar PGA Houston Open.


Appleby fired an even-par 72 that included three birdies and
three bogeys on Friday to remain tied for the lead.


The Australian had opened the tournament with a 66, his first
round under 70 in 21 rounds.


Appleby tied for 13th at the season-opening Mercedes Championship
but has finished no better than 33rd and missed a pair of cuts in
six events since. He also won here in 1999.


With a two-day total of six-under 138, Appleby was tied with five
other players, including second-year pro Bubba Watson.


Watson carded a 67 on Friday, posting a bogey on his second hole
but nabbing six birdies thereafter, including four on his inward
run.


Watson is seeking his first career PGA title.


He finished tied for fourth at the Buick Invitational in January
and has two top-10 finishes in eight starts this season. His best
career finish came as a rookie last season, when he placed third
at the Chrysler Classic.


Also tied for the lead were Bob Estes (71), Jason Gore (68), D.J.
Brigman (68) and Jeff Maggert (71). Estes finished second here
last year.


Hunter Mahan (71), Tommy Armour (71) and Tom Byrum (68) were one
shot back.


Most of the top players have chosen to practice their way into
form leading up to The Masters next week.


Tiger Woods, defending Masters champion Phil Mickelson, South
African Ernie Els and three-time Houston Open champion Vijay
Singh of Fiji all are taking this week off.


The highest ranked player in the field is No. 5 Adam Scott, an
Australian who was at 4-under after a second-round 71.
