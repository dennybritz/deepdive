The sister-in-law of indicted Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic has written a letter to Montenegrin officials
complaining of police harassment, a newspaper reported Saturday.


Milica Karadzic wrote to Montenegro President Filip Vujanovic and
Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic, according to extracts published
in Dan newspaper.


In it, she complained of "bad treatment, humiliation and threats"
from the police.


She said her family had undergone continual surveillance,
including monitoring of their conversations, which had taken a
psychological toll.


Two weeks ago, relatives of Karadzic were questioned by police,
according to media reports.


The police in Niksic, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Podgorica and where Karadzic's family lives, have refused to
comment on the reported questioning.


Milica Karadzic is married to Karadzic's brother, Luka.


Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic have been in hiding
since their 1995 indictment by a UN war crimes tribunal for
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.


The charges are mainly in relation to the 1995 Srebrenica
massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys, the single worst atrocity
in Europe since World War II.
