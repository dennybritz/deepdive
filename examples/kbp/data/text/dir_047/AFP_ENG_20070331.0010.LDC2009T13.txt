Voters in the small west African state of Benin began voting
Saturday in legislative elections seen as a crucial test for
President Yayi Boni one year after he took office.


The election was originally set for March 25. But on the eve of
the vote, the Constitutional Court decided to delay the polls
until the end of the month due to difficulties in organising
them.


Some four million people are eligible to vote in the election
that will choose 83 members of the legislature from among 2,158
candidates from 26 political parties and groups.


Polling stations opened shortly after 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and are
scheduled to close at 4:00 pm (1400 GMT).


The election is seen as test of support for Boni, a virtual
political unknown who was the surprise winner of the presidential
poll in March last year.
