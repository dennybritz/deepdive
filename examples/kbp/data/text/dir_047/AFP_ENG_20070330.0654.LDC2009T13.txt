The Portland Trail Blazers announced Friday that forward Zach
Randolph underwent successful surgery on his right hand.


Randolph will be in a cast for the next five weeks and miss the
remainder of the National Basketball Association regular season.


The procedure repaired ligaments and removed bone fragments in
Randolph's hand.


Randolph, 25, averaged a career-best 23.6 points along with 10.1
rebounds and 2.2 assists in 68 games - 67 starts - for the Trail
Blazers this season.    The injury occurred during Portland's
94-93 loss at Minnesota on Sunday.


Randolph had just missed three games after the team granted him
bereavement leave from March 19-24.


The Trail Blazers went 3-0 in his absence.
