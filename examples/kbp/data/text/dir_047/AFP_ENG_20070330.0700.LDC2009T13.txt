Struggling world champion Grant Hackett turned up for his 1500m
freestyle heat at the world championships Saturday and won it in
a gutsy performance.


After losing his 400m and 800m world titles here there had been
doubt as to whether the Australian dual Olympic champion would
race in his pet event.


He clocked 14 minutes 59.24 secs to finish ahead of American Eric
Vendt and South Korean sensation Park Tae-hwan and remain
unbeaten in the distance for more than a decade.


"I'm pleased I could get up there and swim that fast. I'm pretty
tired now so I'm going to go and get some rest and then come out
and do the best I can in the final," said the 26-year-old.


Hackett has admitted he is struggling to come to terms with the
biggest form slump of his career after losing his 400m title to
Park and finising a distant second-last in the 800m final on
Wednesday.
