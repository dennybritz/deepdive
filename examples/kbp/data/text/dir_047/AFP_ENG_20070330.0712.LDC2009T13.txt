Northern China was blanketed in dust on Saturday as the first
sandstorm of the year struck the region, including the capital
Beijing, state media reported, citing the national weather
service.


Visibility was low in the capital due to the storm, but
meteorologists said the sand was likely to blow out of town by
nightfall due to strong winds, the Xinhua news agency reported.


The mild storm was caused by a cyclone which developed over
Mongolia and then moved eastward toward parts of Inner Mongolia
and northern Hebei province, said Sun Jun of the China
Meteorological Administration, quoted by Xinhua.


Authorities urged residents to stay indoors and cover up if
venturing outside to protect themselves from the floating dust.


Other sandstorms are in the forecast for Gansu, Liaoning, Ningxia
and Shaanxi provinces, along with Inner Mongolia and the Xinjiang
Uighur Autonomous Region, meteorologists said.


Northern China suffered from more than a dozen dust storms last
year which were attributed to desertification in China's
northwestern regions, including Qinghai province. A similar
number has been predicted for this year.


China has around 1.74 million square kilometers (696,000 square
miles) of desertified land, or 18 percent of its total land area.


Despite the sandstorms, the Chinese government has insisted that
it will intensify its efforts to clean the air and prepare for
the 2008 Olympics by planting broad belts of trees around the
capital.
