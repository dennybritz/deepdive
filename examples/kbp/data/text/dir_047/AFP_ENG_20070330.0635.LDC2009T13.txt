Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank is looking to star in a
possible coming remake of the French movie "Intimate Strangers,"
the Hollywood trade magazine Variety reported Friday.


The 2004 Patrice Leconte movie is the story of a woman who spills
intimate details of her life to an accountant she confuses for
her new psychologist.


Swank, 32, has the rare honor of winning two Oscars for best
actress: in 2000 for "Boys Don't Cry," and in 2005 for her role
as a female boxer in director Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar
Baby."
