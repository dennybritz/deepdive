A Pakistani man has received a life sentence for killing and
dismembering a Thai woman he had met through an Internet chat
room, local reports said Saturday.


Mohammad Arif, 35, strangled Dissanee Thongnarkthae, a 28-year-
old English teacher, with a pillow after they had sex in a
Bangkok hotel in May 2006, the English-language papers Nation and
Bangkok Post said.


Arif then dismembered the woman with knives and dumped her body
parts in bags, the reports said, adding the Criminal Court at
first sentenced him to death but reduced to life imprisonment
Friday because of his confessions.


The court also ordered Arif to pay some two million baht (57,000
dollars) in compensation for the victim's family, they said. A
court official could not be reached for confirmation.


Arif claimed he had acted out of "impulsive rage" after the woman
demanded money, the Nation said.
