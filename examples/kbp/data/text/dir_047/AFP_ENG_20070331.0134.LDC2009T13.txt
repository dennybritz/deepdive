Iran on Saturday denied that it planned to keep its controversial
atomic programme secret, insisting the nuclear work would
continue under the supervision of the UN watchdog.


"Inspections and cooperation will go on with no change or halt,"
Iran's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency,
Ali Asghar Soltanieh, told state radio.


"All Iranian (nuclear) activities including enrichment are under
IAEA inspectors' supervision and there is no problem," he said,
asked whether Iran would refrain from presenting information to
the IAEA.


Iran limited cooperation with the atomic watchdog in response to
a UN resolution adopted this month imposing more sanctions on
Tehran for its continued refusal to halt uranium enrichment.


Soltanieh formally announced the decision in a letter sent to
IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei on Thursday.


In a copy of the letter obtained by AFP, Soltanieh said Iran had
to protect its nuclear secrets as the United States and Israel
"are threatening the use of force and attack against the Islamic
Republic and have repeatedly stressed that military action is an
option on the table."


In 2003, Iran agreed to give immediate notification of plans to
build nuclear plants or to modify existing facilities.


Now it will only notify the IAEA of new sites six months before
they begin to function.


Iran says its nulcear programme is aimed at peaceful energy ends,
denying allegations that it sought to secretly develop atomic
weapons.
