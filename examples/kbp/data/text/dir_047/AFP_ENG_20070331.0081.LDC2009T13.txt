Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Saturday he was making
climate change a key agenda item at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summit in Sydney later this year.


Howard said he had written to the other 20 APEC leaders outlining
plans to make clean development and climate change a key agenda
topic.


"Australia is demonstrating strong leadership by putting the
issue at the centre of one of the major leaders' summits of the
year and is committed to developing a strong regional response to
this pressing international challenge," he said.


He said the 21 APEC economies, which include the world's largest
energy consumers, the United States, Japan and China, already
accounted for 60 percent of global energy demand and their energy
demand would likely double by 2030.


"Last year in Hanoi leaders instructed ministers to report in
Sydney on ways APEC might respond to the challenge of meeting
rapidly growing energy demands while minimising environmental
effects," he said in a statement.


"We now need to give practical effect to that instruction."
