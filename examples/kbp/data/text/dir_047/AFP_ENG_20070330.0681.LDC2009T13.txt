All of Brazil's 49 airports were ordered shut down late Friday
amid chaos in South America's largest economy sparked by an air
traffic controllers' strike for better working conditions, the
state airports management agency Infraero said.


Ifraero announced that all takeoffs were cancelled across the
country of 190 million, and that the only operations allowed were
the landings of planes already in flight.


Airport waiting areas were jammed with thousands of people, many
increasingly desperate and confused by the situation.


Among the most affected, most heavily trafficked are the airports
controlled by the Cindacta-1 control center in Brasilia. It is in
charge of flights in the states of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio
de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, Goias, Brasilia, southern Tocantins
and Mato Grosso.
