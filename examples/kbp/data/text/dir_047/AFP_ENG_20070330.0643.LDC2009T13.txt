The United States and South Korea have until 12 pm (1600 GMT)
Sunday to wrap up difficult talks on a free trade agreement, the
US Trade Representative's office said late Friday.


"Negotiations continue between the US and the Republic of Korea
on a number of outstanding issues," spokesman Sean Spicer said in
a statement.


"The negotiations must conclude by 12:00 pm on Sunday April 1 so
that the administration can decide whether to notify Congress of
its intent to sign by Sunday, April 1, the deadline for
Congressional notification under Trade Promotion Authority,"
Spicer said.


Earlier, the White House warned that the talks "aren't going
well" -- a sentiment echoed by a top South Korean negotiator in
the banking sector.


"The talks aren't going well, and unless the negotiations show
some signs of significant progress in the next few hours this
agreement will most likely not come together," White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino said.
