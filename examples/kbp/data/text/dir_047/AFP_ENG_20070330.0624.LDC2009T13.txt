Michael Vaughan breathed a huge sigh of relief as England got
their World Cup Super Eights campaign off to a winning start on
Friday with a 48-run victory over Ireland.


The win also gave England their first two points which moved them
provisionally into fourth place in the table.


But the England captain admitted there was plenty still to do
ahead of a more testing clash against 1996 world champions Sri
Lanka in Antigua next Wednesday.


"There is a concern over the top order," said Vaughan who was out
for six while fellow opener Ed Joyce, a former Ireland
international, was dismissed for one.


Ian Bell, at three, made 31 before the middle order of Kevin
Pietersen (48), Paul Collingwood (90) and Andrew Flintoff (43)
came to the rescue as England posted a challenging total of 266-7
in their 50 overs.


"We will need to work hard now in the nets to get ready for Sri
Lanka. But the most important thing was to get two points as we
didn't carry through any points from the first round," said
Vaughan.


"Also credit to the Irish bowlers who bowled very well."
