Spanish giants Barcelona, spearheaded by Ronaldinho, are planning
pre-season matches this summer in Hong Kong, Beijing and Tokyo, a
report said Saturday.


The European champions are expected to travel to China to play
Guo'an in Beijing on August 5, followed by a match against
Marinos FC in Tokyo on August 7.


They plan to end their tour in Hong Kong with a game on August 9

July.
