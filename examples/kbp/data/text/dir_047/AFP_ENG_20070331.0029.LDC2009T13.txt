Three car bombs killed 11 people and wounded dozens as Iraq's
relentless insurgency and sectarian violence continued on
Saturday, security officials said.


Five people were killed and 15 more wounded when a car bomb
exploded outside Al- Sadr hospital in Baghdad's Shiite enclave of
Sadr City.


The district is a favourite target of Sunni extremists in the
ongoing sectarian conflict with Shiites.


A second car bomb killed four people, including two policemen and
wounded 20, including many policemen, near a service station in
the central Shiite city of Hilla, police said.


They were guarding the fuel station when the bomb exploded, also
destroying 10 cars that were waiting for petrol.


In the town of Tuz Khurmatu, near the northern oil hub of Kirkuk,
another two civilians were killed and 11 wounded when a car bomb
exploded in a central square, local police chief Abbas Mohammed
Amin said.


Insurgents have carried out massive attacks across Iraq this
week, killing more than 400 people in the past four days alone.
