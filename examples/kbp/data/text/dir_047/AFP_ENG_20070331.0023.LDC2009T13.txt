Two car bombs killed four people and wounded dozens as Iraq's
relentless insurgency and sectarian violence continued on
Saturday, security officials said.


Two policemen were killed and 23 people wounded, including many
policemen, when a car bomb exploded near a service station in the
central Shiite city of Hilla, police said.


They were guarding the fuel station when the bomb exploded, also
destroying 10 cars that were waiting for petrol at the outlet.


In the town of Duz, near the northern oil hub of Kirkuk, another
two civilians were killed and 11 wounded when a car bomb exploded
in a central square, local police chief Abbas Mohammed Amin said.


Insurgents have carried out massive attacks across Iraq this
week, killing more than 400 people in the past four days alone.
