Tamil Tiger rebels on Saturday accused  government forces of
shelling civilian settlements in eastern Sri Lanka and killing at
least eight villagers.


Troops killed eight civilians, including four children, when they
fired at a suburb of Sittandy in the eastern region late on
Thursday, the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said.


"Eight civilians, including four children, were killed," the LTTE
said in a statement. "Six shells were fired towards the civilian
settlement. Eight houses were damaged."


The rebel statement came after the defence ministry on Friday
accused the Tamil Tigers of shelling the villages and killing
civilians.


However, the Tigers said they had not opened fire in the disputed
area on Thursday.


The Tigers also accused the military of killing an elderly couple
in the northern peninsula of Jaffna on Wednesday.


Sri Lankan war planes bombed suspected Tiger positions on Friday
after the rebels blew up five soldiers.


Supersonic jets bombed rebel-held territory after the LTTE set
off a roadside bomb and ambushed a military vehicle, killing five
soldiers and wounding another on Friday, the military said.


The rebels have been waging a 35-year-old campaign for
independence.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged by
peace broker Norway in 2002.
