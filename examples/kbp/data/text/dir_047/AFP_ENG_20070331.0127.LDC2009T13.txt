Kate Ziegler of the United States upstaged French superstar Laure
Manaudou to win one of the closest 800m freestyle races ever seen
and take the world championship gold medal Saturday.


Manaudou set the pace early on and was more than a second under
world record speed at the 200m mark.


Ziegler went out with her and the two established clear water
between them and the rest of the field.


It came down to a sprint finish and the two were still stroke-
for-stroke going down the last 15m before long distance
specialist Ziegler found a late spurt to touch in 8:18.52.


Manaudou took silver in 8:18.80 and Hayley Peirsol of the United
States won the bronze in 8:26.41.


Ziegler's time was the second fastest over the distance in
history after Janet Evans who still holds the world record
(8:16.22) which she set in Tokyo in 1989.


"To be two seconds behind, I couldn't be happier," the American
said of Evans' record.


"Last summer I went 8 (minutes) 24.00 (seconds) and I knew that
wasn't my best swim so I wanted to come in and see what I could
do.


"I like to take my races out fast."


Peirsol, sister of backstroke champion Aaron, said she was glad
to get a medal in such a fast race.


"It feels good. I'm glad to get a medal. It's been a long season.
I would have liked to have swum a bit faster but I'm happy with
that, for now," she said.


"I think I just dove in and swam my own race. I only saw lanes
two and three so I didn't even see how far ahead they (Ziegler
and Laure) were. That's not to say that I could have caught them
if I had seen them."
