Therese Alshammar won Sweden's first gold medal at the world
championships in the women's 50-metres butterfly here Saturday,
putting her victory down to "dedication and focus".


Alshammar has now a medal of every colour in the event after
winning silver at Fukuoka in 2001 and bronze at Montreal two
years ago.


She clocked 25.91 seconds to down Australia's defending champion
Danni Miatke (26.05) and Inge Dekker of the Netherlands (26.11).


"It's excellent. I feel terrific," she said, revealing her secret
was "dedication and focus."


"I figured I wanted to go under 26 (seconds) again, but I
tightened up at bit at the end as you tend to do in finals."


The Swede equalled Dutch swimmer Inge de Bruijn's record total of
four medals in all 50m events at the FINA world championships.
