A Ukrainian swim coach caught on camera in an ugly scuffle with
his daughter that ended up in court was Saturday banned from
coaching for six years.


Mikhaylo Zubkov, 38, was filmed pushing and shoving Kateryna
Zubkova, 18, in a marshalling area at Rod Laver Arena during the
world swimming championships on Tuesday night.


The pair appeared in court on Thursday but Kateryna refused to
testify and a police request to extend an intervention order that
stopped Zubkov going within 200 metres of his daughter was turned
down.


In newspaper interviews, they both said it was a "personal and
delicate family matter" and have since made up.


But world swimming's governing body FINA ruled that Zubkov had
breached its code of conduct and brought the sport into
disrepute.


"The FINA Disciplinary Panel recommends to FINA that Mr. Zubkov
be eligible to apply to be readmitted to FINA not before six
years," it said in a statement.
