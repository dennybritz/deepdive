Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh asked Electricity Minister
Ali Mujawar on Saturday to form a new government to replace the
one headed by Abdul Qadir Bajamal, a senior official said.


The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not
provide any further details.


Major donor countries, concerned that the reform process in Yemen
has stalled, have stepped up pressure on Sanaa by linking aid to
tangible change.


Saleh, who first took office as leader of the then North Yemen in
1978, has survived a 1994 civil war with the former communist
south and Al-Qaeda-inspired violence in Osama bin Laden's
ancestral homeland.


Government fores are also locked in battle with followers of the
rebel Zaidi tribal leader Abdul Malek al-Huthi in the state's
mountain regions.


The tribe led a rebellion against government forces in 2004 and
2005 that left hundreds dead.


The Zaidis are an offshoot of Shiite Islam dominant in
northwestern Yemen, but form a minority in the mainly Sunni
country.


The rebels reject as illegitimate the regime which seized power
in a 1962 coup known as the September 26 revolution, overthrowing
a Zaidi imamate.
