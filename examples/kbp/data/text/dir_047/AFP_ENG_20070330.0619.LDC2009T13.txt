Former European champions Borussia Dortmund's miserable season
hit a new low as they slipped into the relegation zone following
a 1-0 defeat at Arminia Bielefeld.


Bielefeld climbed out of the bottom three after a 79th minute
goal from Dane Jonas Kamper earned the hosts the three points.


They leaped over Dortmund on goal difference, as the 2002
champions went a fifth straight game without a win and suffered a
seventh defeat in their last nine.


Dortmund have only seven games left to save their season and
coach Thomas Doll, who took over from Juergen Roeber just over
two weeks ago, is seriously worried.


"What I saw tonight did not please me one bit. We didn't press
the ball enough and didn't play with enough rhythm," said Doll,
who was sacked by Hamburg in February as they sat bottom of the
league.


"We are in the relegation zone now and the following week will be
very tough, but we can still get out of this situation."


On Saturday, leaders Schalke 04 travel to champions Bayern Munich
in the glamour tie of the weekend.


Bayern are fourth in the league, nine points behind Schalke.
