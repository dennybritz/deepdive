The Ethiopian government late Friday said its army has killed
more than 200 insurgents in Mogadishu since launching an
offensive in the city as part of its support for the struggling
Somali government.


"More than 200 armed people have been killed, several wounded,
and 13 have surrendered," according to a statment from Ethiopia's
information ministry, cited by the official ENA news agency.


It added that 13 military vehicles of the insurgents have been
destroyed and "a military helicopter has been damaged from our
side," the ministry said in an apparent reference to Mi-24
gunship hit by an insurgents' missile that came down on waste
land in Mogadishu airport on Friday.


"Under requisition from the transitional government of Somalia,
Ethiopian forces took an offensive on selected insurgency targets
in Mogadishu, and as a result peace has been reaffirmed in the
Somali capital," it said.


The offensive triggered clashes over the past two days that have
led to at least 55 people killed, the highest toll in a 24-hour
period since the start of the year, when Ethiopian forces helped
the Somali transitional government drive out the leaders of the
Islamist movement controlling Mogadishu.


The United Nations criticised the Ethiopian offensive.


"We don't believe that forceful disarmament in Mogadishu can be a
proper way," UN representative for Somalia Francois Fall told AFP
in Nairobi. "We are calling on all the parties to stop fighting."


The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross voiced
concern over the high number of civilian casualties.
