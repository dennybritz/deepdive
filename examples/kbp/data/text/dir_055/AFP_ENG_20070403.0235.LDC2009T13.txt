Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Tuesday lost an appeal
against a decision by the electoral commission to bar him from
this month's presidential election.


An appeals court in Abuja ruled that Nigeria's Independent
Electoral Commission does have the power to disqualify a
candidate from running in the April 21 election.


"It is my considered view that not only has the appelant (the
electoral commission) the power to screen and disqualify
candidates but to remove the name of candidates without recourse
to court," a statement read by one of the judges, Rabiu Danlami
Mohammad, said.


"We are appealing immediately", Niyi Akintola, a lawyer of
Atiku's Action Congress (AC) party told journalists.


AC will be able to take its appeal to the Supreme Court.


The feud between President Olusegun Obasanjo and his deputy Atiku
Abubakar goes back to Obasanjo's attempt in 2006 to have the
constitution modified to allow him to run for a third term in
office.


One of the strongest opponents of that attempt was Abubakar.


Obasanjo, who failed to obtain the desired constitutional change,
subsequently vowed that he would not allow his deputy to succeed
him.


Abubakar was indicted on corruption charges, which some analysts
say were politically motivated.


He then defected from the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP)
to run under the banner of the opposition AC.


Obasanjo went to court to argue that defection from the PDP was
grounds enough to declare the seat of vice president vacant.


But a court on February 20 ruled against the president.


On March 15 INEC, while never formally said it had barred Atiku
Abubakar from running, left his name off the list of candidates
that were approved to stand.
