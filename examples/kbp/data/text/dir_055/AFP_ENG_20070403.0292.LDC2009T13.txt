French President Jacques Chirac said Tuesday that cutting
military spending would be "naive and irresponsible" as he paid
his last visit to army troops before stepping down next month.


"I say today before you and with the greatest conviction and with
the greatest firmness that the allocation for defence cannot be a
variable for adjusting our budgetary policy," Chirac said in the
southwestern city of Bayonne.


"France must guarantee its security on its own, as it has always
done throughout its history, and continue to fully assume its
responsibilities in the world," said Chirac after meeting with
troops who recently served in Afghanistan and Ivory Coast.


"If France were to lower its guard, she would no longer be in
control of security and of her destiny. Such a choice would be
naive and irresponsible," he said.


The comments appeared to be a swipe at Socialist presidential
candidate Segolene Royal, who has called for scrapping plans to
build a second aircraft-carrier for the navy, at a cost of two to
three billion euros.


Frontrunner Nicolas Sarkozy, who enjoys Chirac's backing, has
said he will maintain military spending at its current level, at
about two percent of GDP.


Chirac is due to step down on May 16 after 12 years in office and
hand over to a successor elected from the April 22 and May 6
votes.
