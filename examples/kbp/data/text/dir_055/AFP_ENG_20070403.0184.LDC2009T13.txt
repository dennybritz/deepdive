Diplomats from the United States, Europe and Africa met on
Tuesday in Cairo in a bid to bolster the ailing reconciliation
efforts in war-torn Somalia.


The meeting of the International Contact Group on Somalia was
attended by the US assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, Jendayi Frazer, and Norwegian State Secretary Raymond
Johansen.


Several African officials were also taking part in the talks at
the Arab League's Cairo headquarters.


The contact group was formed last June but has struggled to bring
Somalia's warring parties back to the negotiating table.


The peace efforts came after four days of fierce fighting in the
Somali capital between Ethiopian-backed Somali troops and rebels
killed more than 120 people and forced thousands to flee.


The government is struggling to pacify Mogadishu ahead of a
National Reconciliation Conference, planned to start April 16,
despite threats of disruption by hardline Islamists.


A contingent of 1,200 Ugandan peacekeepers deployed under the
aegis of the African Union has so far failed to stem the
violence.
