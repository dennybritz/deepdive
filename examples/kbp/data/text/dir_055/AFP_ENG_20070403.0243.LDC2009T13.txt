Sale's England hooker Andy Titterrell will join Gloucester at the
end of the season after signing a three year contract on Tuesday.


Titterrell, an athletic front row who was selected for the 2005
Lions tour to New Zealand, missed just one match for Sale last
season.


The 26-year-old has won four caps, making his Test debut against
New Zealand in 2004, but was omitted from the elite player squad
last year.


He has been competing with Sebastien Bruno for Sale's number two
jersey and departs the injury-ravaged English champions for the
Premiership's leaders.


Titterrell said: "Gloucester is a fantastic club - one of the
strongest and most progressive in Europe - and I'm thrilled to be
joining them.


"When I had the opportunity to speak to their coaching team I was
hugely impressed with the standard of facilities, their vision
for the club and their thirst for success.


"Sale were instrumental in my development as a rugby player and I
thank them for that, but this is a new period in my career and I
am excited about moving south."


Head coach Dean Ryan views Titterrell as another piece in the
jigsaw as Gloucester build a team capable of competing with
Europe's elite.


"We are attempting to develop our squad to a level that is
capable of challenging anywhere in Europe," he said.


"To have the opportunity to sign a player of Andy's quality is
great for us. He is an international-quality footballer and the
opportunity to sign those sorts of players does not come around
that often."
