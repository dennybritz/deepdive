Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Tuesday that Britain would have
to take "increasingly tougher decisions" if Iran did not release
15 captive sailors as soon as possible.


Speaking in Glasgow, he said the government has had "two very
clear tracks" throughout the crisis.


"One is to try and settle this by way of peaceful, calm
negotiation, get our people back as quickly as possible ... The
other is to make it clear that if that's not possible, then we
have to take increasingly tougher decisions," Blair declared.
