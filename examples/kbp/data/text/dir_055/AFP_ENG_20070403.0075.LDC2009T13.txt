Consumer prices in Switzerland increased by 0.2 percent in March
on an annual basis, according to data released by the Federal
Statistics Office on Tuesday.


The inflation rate compared with stable consumer prices recorded
a month earlier.


On a month-on-month basis, the Swiss consumer price index climbed
0.1 percentage points in March, mainly owing to fuel prices and
imports, the statistics office said.
