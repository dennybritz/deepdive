France Telecom hopes to build on the success of its development
in Egypt to further expand in the region, chairman Didier Lombard
said on Tuesday.


"I always said that the growth opportunities of France Telecom
are focused on this part of the world because it's a region where
the growth rate is one of the highest," he told reporters.


"Egypt can be a good start, a good basis to make this
investment," said Lombard, who met Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and
Minister of Communications Tariq Kamel during his three-day trip.


The French telecom giant owns 71.25 percent of Egyptian mobile
operator Mobinil, which recently reached 10 million subscribers
and has a 52 percent market share in the Arab world's most
populous country.


"As a shareholder of Mobinil it has been a big success because we
started with very few subscribers five years ago and now we
celebrate 10 million," Lombard said.


He said France Telecom was seeking to use Mobinil as a
springboard for further investment in the region.


"We used to follow this process in all parts of the world, and
usually it is more efficient than direct investment," he said.


France Telecom already has a presence in Jordan.


During his trip, Lombard also announced plans to create 400 new
jobs at France Telecom's Orange Business Services (formerly
Equant) centre in Cairo, bringing the total number of employees
there to 1,500.


Orange Business Services -- a global leader in communication
solutions for multinational companies worldwide -- has its
largest centre in Cairo.


"I have never seen such an efficient centre worldwide," he said.


France Telecom has 160 million customers overal, more than 100
million of them ouside France.
