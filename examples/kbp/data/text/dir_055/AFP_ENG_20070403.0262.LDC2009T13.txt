France's TGV fast train set a new world speed record on rails
Tuesday, hitting 574.8 kilometres per hour (357.2 miles per hour)
on a specially prepared stretch of track east of Paris, according
to official monitors.


The record -- easily beating the 515.3 kph set by a TGV (Traine a
Grande Vitesse) in 1990 -- was made by an experimental version
equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large
wheels.


However the TGV narrowly missed the overall world train speed
record of 581 kph (360.8 mph) reached in 2003 by a Japanese
magnetic levitation, or Maglev, train.


Manufacturer Alstom arranged the exploit to test its latest
engineering designs in extreme conditions, and also to display
the TGV's technological prowess to clients in a growing world
market.


Facing stiff competition from German and Japanese rivals, Alstom
is angling for future bids from Argentina, China and Italy, as
well as from the US state of California.
