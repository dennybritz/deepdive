Qatar's emir on Tuesday appointed foreign minister Sheikh Hamad
bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani as prime minister in place of Sheikh
Abdullah bin Khalifa al- Thani, the state news agency QNA
reported.


His appointment was announced only minutes after news from the
state media of the resignation of Sheikh Abdullah, a half-brother
of Emir Sheikkh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, ruler of the gas-rich
Gulf state.


No reason was given for the resignation of 48-year-old Sheikh
Abdullah, but political observers in Qatar said it came as no
surprise after persistent reports in recent months that he was
"tired".


Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem, meanwhile, has long been seen as one of
the most influential figures in Qatari politics.


Qatar on Sunday held municipal council elections, only the third
local polls in the emirate. The country's first partial
legislative election is expected later this year.


Sheikh Hamad, who also served as a first deputy premier in the
outgoing cabinet, will continue to hold the foreign affairs
portfolio in the new government, QNA said.


All others ministers in the outgoing cabinet remained in office,
it said.


A new post for a state minister for energy and industrial affairs
was created, with Mohammed Saleh al-Sada, who had been managing
director of RasGas company, appointed to the post, it added.


The last cabinet reshuffle in Doha took place in December, 2003,
when Mohammed bin Ahmad bin Jassim al-Thani was appointed as the
new minister of economy and trade.
