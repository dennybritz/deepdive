A Polish court on Tuesday ordered the extradition of a local man
to answer charges of rape and attempted murder in Britain.


The man, identified according to Polish legal practice only as
Jakub T., lost his appeal against extradition at the court in his
home town of Poznan, in western Poland, the PAP news agency
reported.


British media have identified him as Jakub Tomczak, 24.


He is suspected of a brutal assault on a 48-year-old woman in the
southwest English city of Exeter in July 2006, and was arrested
on a European Union warrant in Poznan in February.


He denies the charges.


His lawyers claim that DNA tests allegedly implicating their
client are flawed and have also pointed to discrepancies between
video surveillance and witness evidence.
