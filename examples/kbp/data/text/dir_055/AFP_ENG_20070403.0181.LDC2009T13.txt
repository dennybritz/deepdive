Mozambique is to launch a programme to destroy nearly 400 tonnes
of obsolete arms and explosives after a recent blast at the
country's main armoury left 119 people dead, the defence ministry
said Tuesday.


"We are going to destroy nearly 400 tonnes of explosives and
other military material left over from the (1976-1992 civil) war
and which are currently stored around the country," defence
ministry spokesman Joaquim Mataruca told AFP.


"We should begin next week and we expect the process to last for
at least a month. It will be carried out by the Mozambican armed
forces and with technical assistance from the South African
army," he added.


The spokesman said that the army had already begun blowing up
around 4,000 explosives which failed to go off when the main
armoury, situated close to Maputo's international airport,
erupted into a giant fireball on March 22.


The material was being destroyed in a series of controlled
explosions at Moamba, southwest of Maputo.


Apart from the 119 fatalities, around 500 others were injured
when the massive stockpile of weapons and explosives, which
included missiles and landmines, suddenly blew up.


An official inquiry has been launched into the cause of the
tragedy which initial reports suggest was caused by high
temperatures and poor storage conditions.
