Gunmen killed three people in an attack on the mayor of Armenia's
second-largest city who was wounded and in serious condition in
hospital on Tuesday, prosecutors said.


Gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons on a two car-convoy
taking Mayor Vardan Gukasian from Yerevan back to Gyumri, a city
of 151,000 located kilometres (75 miles) northwest of the
capital, late Monday.


Three people in the convoy died at the scene, a spokesman for the
prosecutor general said. Gukasian, his deputy Gagik Manukian and
his driver were wounded and taken to hospital. Three others
escaped injury.


Gukasian, a member of Armenia's ruling Republican party, was
returning to Gyumri following a party vote Monday night to name
Defence Minister Serge Sarkisian as Armenia's new prime minister.


Sarkisian, 52, will succeed Andranik Margarian, who died of a
heart attack on March 25 after seven years as prime minister.


Politics often turn violent in Armenia, an ex-Soviet country in
the volatile Caucasus region south of Russia. In 1999, five
gunmen stormed into the parliament and killed the prime minister
and seven other top officials.
