The chief of staff of Russia's armed forces warned Washington on
Tuesday that taking military action against Iran would be a
"serious political error" and would not benefit the United
States.


"The United States has a deployment of troops in the region which
is capable of carrying out strikes on Iranian territory, but such
action would be a serious political error," said General Yuri
Baluyevsky, according to the Interfax news agency.


"It is certainly possible to inflict damage on the military and
industrial potential of Iran but that would not signify a
victory, (because) there would be repercussions across the whole
world."


Washington recently increased its naval presence in the Gulf to
two aircraft carriers, the largest such deployment since the US
invasion of Iraq in 2003.


It denies planning attacks on Iran. But in February, US Vice
President Dick Cheney said that "all options remain on the table"
in trying to stop the Islamic republic build nuclear weapons.


Tehran has denied allegations that its civilian nuclear energy
programme is a cover for secretly developing nuclear weapons.
