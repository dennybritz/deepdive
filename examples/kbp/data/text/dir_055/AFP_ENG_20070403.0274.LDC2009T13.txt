Spanish contruction firm Acciona and Italian power supplier Enel
plan to present their bid for Spanish electricity supplier Endesa
in the second half of April, Acciona Secretary General Juan
Miguel Goenchea said on Tuesday.


"The lodging (of the public offer for Endesa) could be in the
second half of April," he told a conference with analysts.


Late on Monday the two companies opened the way for their bid
when they reached a compromise with E.ON, which saw the German
power giant drop out of the race to take over Endesa.


In the increasingly acrimonious bidding war, Acciona and Enel had
vowed to better E.ON's 42.3-billion-euro (56-billion-dollar) bid
for Endesa.


The two have commited themselves to offer at least 41 euros per
share, valuing the Spanish group at 43.4 billion euros, the
biggest public offer ever launched in the energy sector.


Acciona and Enel currently together hold around 46 percent of the
shares in Endesa.


The deal with E.ON, under which the German group is to obtain
energy interests in France, Italy and Spain, will need regulatory
approval from the European Union and Spanish authorities which
could come in two months, Goenechea said.


Acciona's vice president Juan Muro-Lara said that the three
companies were confident of getting approval.


"All the parties are calm and think that the accord is perfectly
legal," he said.
