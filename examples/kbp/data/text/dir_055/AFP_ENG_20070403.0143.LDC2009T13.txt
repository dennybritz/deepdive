South Korea and North Korea will resume talks next week to find
and repatriate the remains of a prominent independence fighter
buried in China, the Unification Ministry said here Tuesday.


Following a year-long hiatus, a fourth meeting of officials will
take place Tuesday in North Korea's Kaesong city near the border
with South Korea.


At the third and last round of talks, the two sides agreed to
launch a joint team to find and disinter the remains of An Jung-
Geun, who is believed to have been buried near a former prison
run by Japanese authorities in the north- eastern Chinese city of
Dalian.


An was executed in Dalian in 1910, a year after he fatally shot
Hirobumi Ito, a Japanese national hero who played leading roles
in annexing Korea, on a railway platform in the northeastern
Chinese city of Harbin.


But the excavation project was shelved after North Korea fired
missiles in July, sparking international condemnation.


The Korean peninsula was colonized by Japan from 1910 to 1945.


Millions of Koreans were conscripted into forced labour by
Japanese colonial rulers and tens of thousands died due to
exhaustion and poor working conditions during World War II.


Relations between Japan and South Korea have often been frayed
over their history and disputed islets.
