Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on Tuesday called the
president's order to dissolve parliament a "fatal mistake," and
urged legislators to keep working.


Addressing an emergency session of parliament, the pro-Russian
Yanukovych said the dissolution decree signed by his rival, pro-
Western President Viktor Yushchenko, was unconstitutional.


The only possible way "of remedying the president's fatal mistake
is waiting for a decision by the constitutional court," he told
legislators in a session broadcast live on television.


"Until such a decision is made, parliament and the government
should work as usual," he said, adding that the president should
negotiate "for the sake of Ukraine's future."


The president and prime minister will hold talks on the crisis at
1100 GMT, parliamentary speaker Olexander Morozov was quoted as
saying by the news agency Interfax.


Yushchenko's office said Tuesday that the dissolution had
officially come into effect through publication in a presidential
bulletin following failed crisis talks with legislators the
previous night.


Tensions have mounted between the president and Yanukovych's pro-
Russian ruling coalition since March, when the prime minister's
supporters swept parliamentary elections.
