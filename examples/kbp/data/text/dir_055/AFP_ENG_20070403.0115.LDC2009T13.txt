A New Zealand man drowned in the Solomon Islands tsunami while
trying to save his crippled mother from the surging waves.


Teangauki Toma, 53, was visiting family in the Gizo area, one of
the regions worst hit by Monday's tsunami, which was sparked by
an 8.0-magnitude earthquake.


He refused to leave his mother Beima Toma when a second massive
wave swept through his parents' small village. His body was later
recovered, although his mother remained missing.


The prison officer and father of eight was brought up in the
Solomons before moving to New Zealand 34 years ago. He was making
his first trip to the Solomons for 18 years in order to visit his
ailing parents.


His daughter Teresa, 29, said despite their grief, the family was
immensely proud of what he had done.


"The one thing we keep saying over and over again is how proud
(we are). He is our hero," she told the New Zealand Press
Association.


New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark described Toma's death as
"very tragic".


"Our hearts go out to the family," she said.


Meanwhile, New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters
said the country would make an initial 500,000 dollar (355,000
US) contribution to the Solomon Islands and also provide urgently
needed relief supplies.


He said an air force aircraft flew Tuesday to the Solomons loaded
with food and other emergency supplies.


"Initial assessments of damage and casualties are continuing but
the available information suggests the situation is grave and
there are thousands of Solomon Islanders requiring urgent
assistance," Peters said.
