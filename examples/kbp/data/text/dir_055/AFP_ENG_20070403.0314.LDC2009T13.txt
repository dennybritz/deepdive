Iraq has lost some eight billion dollars to administrative and
financial corruption since the 2003 US-led invasion which toppled
the Saddam Hussein regime, an anti-corruption panel said on
Tuesday.


"The estimated value of the wasted sum because of administrative
and financial corruption is eight billion dollars," Radi al-
Radhi, head of the anti-corruption committee, said in a statement
emailed to news organisations.


Radhi blamed the constitution for some of the funds lost, saying
one of the clauses in the Iraqi law blocked the launching of
legal action against government employees.


"Article 136 B stipulates that no civil servant should be sent
for trial before the consent of his minister," the statement
quoted Radhi as saying. The article was obstructing
investigations into the "lost money".


The official said that efforts were being made to abolish the
clause from the constitution and clear the way for action against
employees accused of fraud and corruption.


Radhi also revealed his panel was investigating around 180
employees of the oil ministry in the southern port city of Basra
following reports of corruption, but it was not known whether
they will face trial.


The committee was set up in 2004 to monitor spending at state
offices.
