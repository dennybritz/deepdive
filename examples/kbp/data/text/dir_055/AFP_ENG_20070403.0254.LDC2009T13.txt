Indian share prices bounced back 1.36 percent on Tuesday on
bargain-hunting after posting the sharpest fall in nearly a year,
a day earlier, dealers said.


They said sentiment remained subdued as investors fear India's
central bank could raise interest rates further to curb
inflation.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex closed up
169.21 points at 12,624.58. Gainers led losers 1,390 to 1,040 on
volume of 28.8 billion rupees (669 million dollars).


On Monday, the Sensex slid 4.72 percent to 12,455.37, its biggest
one-day drop since May 18, 2006, after the central bank hiked a
key short-term lending rate by a quarter point to 7.75 percent.


Inflation is riding at 6.46 percent, nearly a percentage point
above the bank's tolerance range of 5.50 to 5.50 percent.


"This was a relief rally. The buying momentum is missing and we
expect weakness ahead," said Naresh Garg, chief investment
officer at private sector Sahara Mutual fund.


The market is now looking ahead to the central bank's quarterly
review of the economy on April 24 to determine if further rate
hikes are likely, with some hopeful that the tightening cycle
will come to an end.


The rupee rose to an eight-year high against the dollar at 43.13
from 43.5 Monday as dealers sold dollars to take advantage of
high rates in the money market.


India's leading petrochemical company Reliance Industries rose
27.7 rupees or 2.11 percent to 1,341.2 while state-run
engineering firm Bharat Heavy Electricals rose 100.4 rupees or
4.66 percent to 2,254.
