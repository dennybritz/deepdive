Pirates have hijacked a cargo ship anchored at Somalia's main
port of Mogadishu, a maritime official said Tuesday.


The hijackers took control of the MV Nimatullah late Sunday after
four days of heavy fighting in Mogadishu, sparked by an Ethiopian
offensive on Islamist insurgents and clan fighters.


The ship remained in Mogadishu port Tuesday.


Details of the ship, its crew and its hijackers were still
unclear, Andrew Mwangura, of the Kenyan branch of the Seafarers
Assistance Programme, told AFP by telephone from Mombasa.


He said they had so far only identified the cargo's owner and the
ship's agent in Mogadishu.


"We have sent someone to find the agent of the ship in
Mogadishu," Mwangura said. "We are also investigating the
identity of the crew."


The hijack is the second since Ethiopian troops helped Somali
government forces oust a powerful Islamist movement from
Mogadishu at the end of December.


A UN-chartered cargo ship is still being held off northeast
Somalia. It was seized in February after delivering food aid to
the war-torn nation.


Waters off the unpatrolled 3,700-kilometer (2,300-mile) Somali
coastline saw scores of pirate attacks between March 2005 and
June last year, but these stopped during six months of strict
Islamist rule of south and central Somalia.


Remnants of the Islamists and clan fighters have been battling
government forces and their Ethiopian backers since the start of
the year.
