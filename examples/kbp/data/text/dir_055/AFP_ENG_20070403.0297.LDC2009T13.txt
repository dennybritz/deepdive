Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone said Tuesday that the
number of grand prix on the calendar could be increased by three
to 20 a season.


"We could easily imagine that the number of grand prix in a
season could be 20. That could be Mexico, India and Russia. South
Korea is another candidate," said Ecclestone.


Ecclestone also raised the possibility of organising a new race
on an urban circuit, as well as a night race.


"That (night race) would be ideal for Asia, since it would be the
right time difference to be broadcast in Europe. It would also be
very spectacular, it all depends of course on the circuit."


Concerning the reticence of team bosses over the creation of more
races, he said: "The more we hold races in good countries, the
easier it will be for them to find sponsors."


And amid the threat to the France Grand Prix at Magny-Cours in
2008, Eccelestone warned that no country had a monopoly on the
sport.


"Formula One is very international, it's a world championship,
not a championship linked to certain countries. When the the
standards are not respected we have to go elsewhere," he added.
