A senior diplomat at Iran's embassy in Iraq who was kidnapped in
Baghdad in February has been released and will return to Iran
later on Tuesday, state television reported.


"Jalal Sharafi, the second secretary of Iranian embassy in
Baghdad, was released. He will return to Iran later this
afternoon," state television said.


Iran had accused a group linked to the Iraqi defence ministry and
US forces of being behind the kidnapping, which took place
outside the Baghdad branch of the Iranian state-owned Bank Melli.
