The Swiss group Barry Callebaut, one of the world's largest
chocolate producers, said Tuesday that its six month net profit
had increased by 11.1 percent, partly due to affluent new
consumers in Russia and China.


Half year net profit for the period until the end of February
rose to 125.2 million Swiss francs (78 million euros, 103 million
dollars), the group said in a statement.


Sales revenue rose 4.1 percent to 2.31 billion Swiss francs over
the six month period, while operating income (EBIT) increased 7.3
percent to 190 million Swiss francs, it added.


Barry Callebaut said its sales volumes were growing twice as fast
as the global chocolate market, with an increase of 6.3 percent
to 588,125 tonnes in the first half of its fiscal year.


The fastest growth in demand for chocolate was recorded in
emerging markets, driven by increasingly affluent consumers in
countries like Russia and China.


The Swiss-based group said its earnings were affected by problems
with its North American business unit and a "considerable"
increased in cocoa bean prices.


Barry Callebaut is also one of the world's largest cocoa traders.


"We are on track to reach our three year financial targets for
the period 2005/06 through 2007/08, and our exciting new
outsourcing projects make us confident that we can confirm
these," said chief executive Patrick De Maeseneire.
