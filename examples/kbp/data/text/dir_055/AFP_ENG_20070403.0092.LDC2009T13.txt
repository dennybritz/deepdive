Shares in E.ON, the biggest German power supplier, soared 6.51
percent to 108.80 euros at the start of trading on Tuesday after
the announcement the day before that it was dropping its takeover
bid for Spanish electricity supplier Endesa.


After trying to get its hands on Endesa for more than a year,
E.ON announced late Monday that it was ceding victory to rival
bidders Acciona of Spain and Enel of Italy.


In return, E.ON would buy assets from Endesa worth about 10
billion euros (13 billion dollars), the three partners agreed.
