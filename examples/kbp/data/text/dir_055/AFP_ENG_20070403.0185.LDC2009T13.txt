Australia's Libby Lenton broke the world record in the women's
100m freestyle at the Duel in the Pool meet between Australia and
the United States here on Tuesday.


Lenton touched in 52.93 seconds, lowering German Britta Steffen's
world mark by 0.37 of a second.


Steffen set the previous world mark of 53.30 seconds at the
European Championships in August 2006.


The swim caps off a remarkable week for Lenton, who won five gold
medals at last week's World Championships in Melbourne.


The Duel in the Pool is an annual event between the US and
Australia.
