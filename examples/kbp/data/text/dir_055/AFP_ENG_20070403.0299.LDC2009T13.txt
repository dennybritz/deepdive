The French national railway SNCF has ordered 67 more TER regional
trains from Bombardier for 311 million euros (415 million
dollars), the Canadian manufacturer said Tuesday.


The contract is part of a larger deal for 500 trains agreed upon
in December 2001 worth a total 1.65 billion euros.


Bombardier's high capacity train, known by its acronym AGC, is
destined to operate in 21 of mainland France's 22 regions.
