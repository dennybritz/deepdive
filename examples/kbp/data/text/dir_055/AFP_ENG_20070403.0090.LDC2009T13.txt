An Indian man's plan to abduct and ransom himself to pay a
blackmailer who threatened to reveal an illicit love affair came
undone after he fell off a roof and broke his hip, police said.


Ravindra Kumar of the lawless eastern Indian state of Bihar went
missing on March 19, and his wife alerted police when she
received a ransom demand of 10 million rupees (230,000 dollars).


But the case took a twist Monday after Kumar tumbled from a roof
and was rushed to hospital by his blackmailer.


He was quizzed by police and then charged with lodging a false
case, said Anwar Hussain, police chief for Bihar's capital city
Patna.


He said Kumar's confession also led to the arrest of Rajiv Singh,
who had blackmailed Kumar over an extra-marital affair and then
hatched the abduction and ransom plot to keep the matter quiet.


"One day Rajiv caught Kumar with his girlfriend in a compromising
position. From then on blackmailing began," Hussain said.
