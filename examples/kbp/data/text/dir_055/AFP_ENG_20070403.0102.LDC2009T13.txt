The Dutch logistics group TNT Post said Tuesday that it would cut
between 6,500-7,000 jobs in a reorganisation of its Dutch mail
operations.


The number could rise to 11,000 if an agreement on job
flexibility is not reached with unions, the group added.


The job cuts were to take place from now until 2010 as part of a
drive to achieve 300 million euros (400 million dollars) in
savings presented in December.


The mail distribution group said talks with unions would focus on
salaries.


"Employee wages will be, at best, frozen at the present level for
the next two and a half years," a statement said.


"In addition, other conditions of employment will have to be
brought more in line with the market."


TNT currently employs 58,000 people in the Netherlands.
