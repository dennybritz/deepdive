Microsoft chairman and philanthropist Bill Gates hopes methods
from Vietnam's childhood immunisation programme can help fight
killer diseases in Africa, state media reported Tuesday.


The IT-billionaire and his wife Melinda visited hospitals, spoke
with health care officials and held a private meeting with Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung during a three-day visit to the
communist nation ending Tuesday.


The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with a war chest that
includes almost 30 billion dollars donated by the high-tech
tycoon, funds HIV/AIDS research and vaccinations against
tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases.


Gates said he was impressed with Vietnam's immunisation record
and pledged more support in preventing childhood diseases and
controlling HIV/AIDS, said the state-run Vietnam News Agency.


The World Health Organisation says Vietnam has one of the highest
rates of immunised children in the world, with over 90 percent of
under-ones vaccinated against major diseases.


In June last year the non-profit health group PATH announced a
five-year study, funded with a 27.8 million dollar grant from the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, on cervical cancer
vaccinations.


Seattle-based PATH said it would conduct pilot studies in
Vietnam, India, Peru and Uganda with the aim of introducing
vaccines against the disease that kills more than 270,000 women
worldwide each year.
