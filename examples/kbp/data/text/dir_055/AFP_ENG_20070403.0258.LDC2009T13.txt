British water group Severn Trent announced Tuesday that it would
axe 600 jobs or approximately ten percent of its workforce over
the next five years.


The job cuts would be outlined in detail in early June, when
Severn Trent will issue its annual results statement, the group
said in a trading update.


Severn Trent, which is based in Birmingham, central England,
supplies water to around 3.7 million household and business
customers in Britain.
