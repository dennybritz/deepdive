Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi was discharged from
hospital in neighbouring Jordan on Tuesday after surviving an
assassination attempt in Baghdad last month.


"Mr Zubayi has fully recovered and left the Medical Centre this
morning," Iraqi ambassador Saad Jassem al-Hayyani told AFP. "He
will spend a few days resting in Amman before returning to
Baghdad to resume his duties."


Suspected Sunni militants launched a two-pronged assassination
attempt against Zubayi's Baghdad home on March 23 while he was
praying at a mosque inside the residential compound.


A suicide bomber, believed to have been one of his guards, blew
himself up in the mosque and then a car bomb exploded inside the
compound, killing nine people.


Zubayi is the most senior Sunni Arab in Iraq's Shiite-led
national unity government and underwent emergency surgery in a US
military hospital for shrapnel wounds to his chest before being
transferred to Amman for further treatment.


Iraqi President Jalal Talabani also spent more than two weeks in
hospital in Jordan in early March for treatment for dehydration
and fatigue.
