European stock exchanges have overtaken those in the United
States in value for the first time since World War I, a sign of
the slipping global dominance of US markets, the Financial Times
said Tuesday.


Twenty four European markets, including those in Russia and
emerging eastern countries, "saw their capitalisation rise to
15,720 billion dollars (11,819 billion euros) at the end of last
week," the FT said, citing Thompson Financial data.


The equivalent figure for US markets was 15,640 billion dollars,
the newspaper said.


European markets have closed a long-standing gap with the United
States owing to the rise in value of the euro, growth of eastern
European markets including those in Russia, and better
performance compared with US rivals owing to improved
profitability of European groups, the report added.


It quoted stock market historian Mike Staunton of the London
Business School as saying that the last time Europe surpassed the
United States in market capitalisation was likely before World
War I.


At Absolute Strategy Research, Ian Harnett called the development
a "seismic shift" in markets, the report said.


The FT said that Europe trailed the United States on market
capitalisation indexes compiled by the FTSE and MSCI, which took
little or no account of "shares that cannot be freely traded such
as holdings of governments or controlling family shareholders.


"Europe has more companies with such stakes," the newspaper
noted.
