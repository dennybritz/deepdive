Macau confirmed 2006 as it biggest year ever Tuesday, revealing
that casino income exceded 7.0 billion US dollars, outrunning Las
Vegas' famous strip.


The tiny southern enclave's 22 casinos generated 16.7 billion
patacas in the final quarter, taking the year's total gross
gaming revenues to 56.2 billion patacas (7.2 billion US dollars).


By comparison, the 40-odd casinos on Las Vegas' main strip --
including the plush Venetian and MGM resorts -- generated 6.6
billion dollars.


Gambling earnings have boomed in Macau since 2001 when the
government ended tycoon Stanley Ho's 40-year monopoly on casinos
in the city and allowed foreign operators to move in.


The result has been a sudden rush of up to 25 billion dollars of
mostly American cash into the once-moribund century-old local
industry.


Growth has been fuelled by a similarly explosive rise in tourism
from China, following the relaxation of travel restrictions from
the mainland in the wake of the former Portuguese enclave's
reversion to Chinese rule in 1999.
