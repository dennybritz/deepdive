Democratic Senator Barack Obama pulled in 20 million dollars in
donations for his White House campaign, only a few million shy of
front-runner Hillary Clinton, the New York Times said Tuesday.


Citing unnamed aides of Obama, who seeks to become the country's
first-ever African-American president, the Times said Obama
brought in 20 million dollars (15 million euros) in the first
three months of the race, compared to Senator Clinton's 26
million, "enough to ratchet up the anxiety in the Clinton camp."


Clinton reported the size of her war chest as of a key fund-
raising deadline on Saturday, while Obama has yet to officially
reveal his takings on the campaign trail.


But the Obama estimate confirmed that this race, with the
Democrats and Republicans both showing large fields of candidates
for their respective nominations, is smashing all records in the
arena of fund-raising.


His 20 million would put the total raised to 108 million dollars,
with the first primaries to decide the candidates nine months
away, and the presidential election itself 20 months down the
road.


The previous record in money raised for all Republican and
Democratic candidates at the corresponding period of presidential
campaigns was 30.9 million, set in 2003.
