US air strikes killed six suspected militants and destroyed two
buildings used to manufacture and store explosives in separate
raids in Iraq on Tuesday, the US military reported.


In an operation targeting presumed Al-Qaeda fighters near the
former rebel town of Fallujah, west of Baghdad, "precision
firing" from a US warplane killed six "terrorists" as ground
forces detained seven more, the military said.


Another raid near the town of Al-Qaim, close to the Syrian
border, led to the capture of six more militants, it added.


A separate air strike south of Baghdad destroyed two large
buildings used to manufacture and store explosives, the military
said earlier Tuesday.


"Ground forces called in for air support when they found large
amounts of chemicals and improvised-explosive-device making
materials in two buildings," in the town of Arab Jubur, it said.


The air strike caused no casualties, it added.


Since the launch of a massive security operation in Baghdad in
February, Iraqi and US troops have reduced execution-style
killings in the capital, but car bombings carried out by
suspected Sunni militants remain a major headache.


In a bid to stop the flow of explosives into the city, the
military is now focusing on detecting bomb-making facilities,
which are believed to be largely located on the outskirts of
Baghdad.
