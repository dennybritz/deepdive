Bundesliga title chasers Werder Bremen received a boost Tuesday
with captain Frank Baumann and German international Tim Borowski
cleared to return to training.


Baumann has been out for the past five months with an ankle
injury while Borowski underwent surgery for an adductor problem
in February.


"I'm no longer in pain, but the coming days are going to be
crucial," said 28 -year-old Borowski.


Bremen are second in the Bundesliga with seven games to play,
just two points off Schalke 04. They play a UEFA Cup quarter-
final tie against Dutch club AZ Alkmaar on Thursday.
