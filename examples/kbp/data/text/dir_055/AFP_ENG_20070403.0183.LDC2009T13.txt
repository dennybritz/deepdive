Valencia's dressing room at Stamford Bridge for Wednesday's
Champions League clash with Chelsea has been compared to a 'rat-
hole' by Spanish daily Marca.


The paper said on Tuesday the Spanish visitors' had to make do
with only three showers "and one mirror for all the players" and
suggested the dressing room was not worthy of "a multi-
millionaire club".


"It's like a rat-hole" Marca said in its Tuesday edition
suggesting that "Chelsea has started the war in the changing
rooms".


In contrast it claimed the Chelsea players enjoyed a "luxurious",
modern and spacious changing room "three times bigger" than the
visitors requipped with a bar and "stratospheric showers".


The paper reckoned that the dressing room was "one of the weapons
used (by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho) against his rivals".


Valencia are in London to take on the English Premiership
champions in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.
