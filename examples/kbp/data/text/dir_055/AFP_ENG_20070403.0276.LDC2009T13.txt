A petrol bomb was thrown into a parking lot of a court in a Serb-
populated town in northern Kosovo early Tuesday, damaging a UN
vehicle but injuring no one, police said.


The blast, the fifth to hit Kosovo in 10 days, comes amid
tensions over the future status of the ethnic Albanian dominated
southern Serbian province, which is seeking independence from
Belgrade.


Police said the Molotov cocktail was thrown in the middle of the
night in Zubin Potok, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) northwest of
Pristina.


A UN report has recommended a form of independence for Kosovo but
Belgrade insists the province must remain part of its soveriegn
territory.


UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari is to brief the UN Security
Council on Tuesday about his contentious proposal to grant the
province internationally supervised independence.


NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the military alliance,
which has some 17,000 peacekeepers in the province, would not
tolerate any violence ahead of the council session.
