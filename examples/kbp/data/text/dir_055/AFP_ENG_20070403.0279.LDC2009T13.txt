Nigeria will auction 45 oil exploration blocs on May 3, Energy
Minister Edmund Daukoru said Tuesday.


"We propose to offer some 45 blocs in this round," Daukoru said,
adding that they would be a mixture of Niger Basin, deep offshore
and inland basin fields.


Nigeria regularly puts exploration fields up for auction to
foreign and domestic bidders. This latest bidding round has been
postoponed several times since late 2006.


"We are going to hold the bidding round conference on May 3 and
sign the production sharing agreements two weeks later," said
Tony Chukwueke, the director of the department of petroleum
resources.
