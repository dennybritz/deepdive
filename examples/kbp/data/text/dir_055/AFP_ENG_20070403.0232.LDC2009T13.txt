EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen urged China on Tuesday
to establish a more transparent system that would make it easier
for European companies to export to the giant Asian market.


Verheugen, also a vice-president of the European Union's
executive arm, made the remark after two days of talks with
Chinese officials in Beijing.


"Procedures (in Europe) are well functioning, transparent and
easy to apply. Chinese exporters are already benefiting while
import of European products to China is still subject to a number
of complicated procedures," he said.


"This situation should be improved. In this context I have
pleaded for more transparency to be able to do business with each
other and have a good climate for investment," he told a briefing
in Beijing.


Verheugen also urged China to do more to protect intellectual
property rights, a perennial bone of contention between China and
its trading partners.


"Both China and the EU must protect our consumers both when it
comes to domestically produced and imported goods," he said.


"We must also ensure that well-known brand names and trademarks
are not put at risk from counterfeited and dangerous products."


China posted a trade surplus with the EU of 91.7 billion dollars
in 2006, up 31 percent from 70.1 billion dollars the year before,
according to Chinese Ministry of Commerce data.


The bloc remained China's top trading partner last year,
accounting for 15.5 percent of the Asian nation's commerce with
the outside world.
