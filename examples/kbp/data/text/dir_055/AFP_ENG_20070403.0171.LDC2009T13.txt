Ukraine's prime minister threatened on Tuesday to force early
presidential elections if his rival President Viktor Yushchenko
does not rescind an order dissolving parliament, Interfax-Ukraine
reported.


Yushchenko "should understand that if he does not rescind his
order, then not only parliamentary, but also presidential
elections are inevitable," Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych told
supporters.


"He should understand that the only way out is looking for a
compromise at the negotiating table," Yanukovych said.
