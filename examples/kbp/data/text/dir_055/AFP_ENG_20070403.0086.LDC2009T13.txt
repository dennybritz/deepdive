A news conference by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad due to
be held on Tuesday has been postponed until Wednesday, an
official said.


"The news conference has been postponed at the request of
journalists," said the official, who asked not to be named.


The news conference, which marks the start of the new Iranian
year on March 21, is keenly anticipated owing to the current
standoffs over Iran's arrest of 15 British sailors and marines
and its controversial nuclear programme.
