The Iranian embassy in Baghdad said on Tuesday that its second
secretary, Jalal Sharafi, who had been kidnapped in the Iraqi
capital in February had been released.


The announcement confirmed a report on state television in
Tehran, which said Sharafi would return to Iran later Tuesday.


Iran had accused a group linked to the Iraqi defence ministry and
US forces of being behind the kidnapping, which took place
outside the Baghdad branch of the Iranian state-owned Bank Melli.
