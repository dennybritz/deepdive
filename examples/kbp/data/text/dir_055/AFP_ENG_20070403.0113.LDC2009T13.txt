South Africa's Springbok rugby squad faces the threat of having
their passports confiscated unless more black players are picked
for this year's World Cup, media reported Tuesday.


The influential chairman of the country's parliamentary sports
committee Butana Komphela warned that this "worst case scenario"
would be necessary if there were not at least six players in the
World Cup squad.


"In principle, we can't allow a team that does not reflect the
South African picture, to represent our country," Komphela was
quoted as saying in the Beeld newspaper.


"My fear is that rugby won't see the World Cup. We will try
convince the minister of home affairs to confiscate their
passports if the team is not representative."


The relationship between the sport and the South African
government has been strained for years due to the lack of black
players in the national teams.


Komphela said a good start would be to have six black or coloured
players in the team.


"Six out of thirteen is not representative but it's a good
start," said Komphela.


The president of the South African Rugby Union Oregan Hoskins
said Komphela's comments should not be seen as idle threats.


"We must take what he says seriously."
