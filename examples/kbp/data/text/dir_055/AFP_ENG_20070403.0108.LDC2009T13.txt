Families of South Koreans kidnapped by the communist North will
be offered financial help under a new law passed by the Seoul
parliament, government officials said Tuesday.


Seoul says 485 of its citizens, mostly fishermen, have been
abducted since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.


The new law, approved Monday, allows the South Korean government
to give citizens financial help to trace, reunite or bring home
relatives held in the North.


It also authorises compensation for relatives if abductees are
found to have died in the North, said the unification ministry,
which handles relations with North Korea.


North Korea has recently allowed some abductees to have temporary
family reunions with South Korean relatives as part of a broader
reunion programme.


Officials said the special law would "contribute to healing the
scar caused by the division" of the Korean peninsula, adding that
the government will continue to work on settling the kidnapping
issue.


The legislation does not cover 548 South Korean prisoners of war
who failed to return home after the war. The North denies holding
any South Koreans against their will.


The Korean peninsula was split into the pro-West South and the
communist North in 1945 and the Cold War division was cemented by
the war.


The prime minister's office plans soon to set up a task force
handling financial support for the families of abductees as part
of the new law.
