Apple denied Tuesday breaking European Union competition laws by
charging different prices on its iTunes websites for music
downloads in different countries.


"We don't believe Apple did anything to violate EU law," a
statement said.


"Apple has always wanted to operate a single, pan-European iTunes
store accessible by anyone from any member state, but we were
advised by the music labels and publishers that there were
certain legal limits to the rights they could grant us," the
company said.


A spokesman for the European Commission -- the EU's executive
body and top competition regulator -- expressed concern Monday
that Apple might be infringing the law by imposing "territorial
restrictions" on music downloads.


European consumers are only able to download music from the
iTunes site in their country of residence and prices differ from
country to country within the 27-nation European Union.


On Friday, the Commission sent a "statement of objections" to
Apple and unnamed "major record companies", the first formal step
Brussels takes in anti-trust procedures.


"We will continue to work with the EU to resolve this matter,"
Apple said in its statement.
