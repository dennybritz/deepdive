The Iranian embassy in Baghdad said on Tuesday that its second
secretary, Jalal Sharafi, who had been kidnapped in the Iraqi
capital in February had been released.


The announcement confirmed a report on state television in
Tehran, which said Sharafi would return to Iran later Tuesday.


"Yes, he was released yesterday," an official at the embassy told
AFP but provided no further details.


Sharafi, 40, was abducted in Karrada, a predominantly Shiite
southeastern district of Baghdad, on February 4 by gunmen dressed
in Iraqi army uniforms outside a branch of the Iranian state-
owned Bank Melli.


His abduction came amid increasing tension between Iran and the
United States, which arrested five Iranians on January 11 in the
northern Iraqi city of Arbil on suspicion of aiding and abetting
the Iraqi insurgency.


But on Tuesday the US military expressed ignorance of Sharafi's
release.


"We were not holding him, so we do not know about his release,"
said spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver.


Iran's foreign ministry had claimed that the United States
supervises Iraq's defence ministry and was thus at least
complicit in the abduction, which it blamed on a group linked to
the Iraqi defence department.
