Britain and Iran have started talks to resolve the standoff over
the capture of 15 British sailors accused of entering Iranian
waters, top security official Ali Larijani told state media on
Tuesday.


"The British government has started diplomatic discussions with
the foreign ministry to resolve the issue of the British
soldiers," Larijani told state television's central news agency.


"It is at the beginning of the path. If they continue on this
path then logically conditions can change and we can go towards
ending this issue."
