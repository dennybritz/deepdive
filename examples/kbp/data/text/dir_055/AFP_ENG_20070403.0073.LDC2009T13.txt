German insurance giant Allianz said Tuesday that had raised its
stake in its life insurance unit Allianz Leben to 92.58 percent.


The holding was nevertheless below the 95 percent needed to
squeeze out the remaining minority shareholders, Allianz said in
a statement.


Allianz said it would not make a new offer to those shareholders.


Nevertheless, the shareholder structure "will enable Allianz
Leben to be successful on the market in the future," the
statement added.
