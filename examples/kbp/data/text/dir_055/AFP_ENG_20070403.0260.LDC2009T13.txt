Australia on Tuesday began deploying two million dollars (1.6
million US) of emergency supplies and medical teams to tsunami-
stricken areas of the Solomon Islands, officials said.


A plane was preparing to head to the zone -- shattered Monday by
a tidal wave unleashed by an 8.0-magnitude quake -- carrying
medical assessment teams, water, food rations and shelters, the
foreign affairs department said.


"The Australian Government is mobilising relief supplies and
personnel to assist victims of the earthquake-tsunami in Solomon
Islands," it said in a statement.


The deployment came a day after Australia offered the aid to the
Solomons government, with which it has frosty relations, and as
Prime Minister John Howard offered to provide further aid if
necessary.


The medical assessment team will travel to the disaster area to
provide aid, analyse health needs and infrastructure damage.


"Reports suggest that several medical centres have been lost. The
health mission will also support the restoration of health
services over the longer term," the government statement said.


Under its commitment, Canberra will provide finds to none-
governmental aid agencies including Caritas, the Australian Red
Cross, World Vision and Oxfam.


Australia and the Solomons have for months been locked in a
bitter diplomatic row over Canberra's attempts to extradite the
former attorney general-designate of the Solomons to face child
sex charges.
