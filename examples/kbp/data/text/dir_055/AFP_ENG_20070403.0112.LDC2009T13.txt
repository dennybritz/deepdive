Russia voiced concern Tuesday after Ukrainian President Viktor
Yushchenko ordered the dissolution of parliament, and urged a
compromise between pro- Western and pro-Russian factions in Kiev.


"Russia is following developing events in Ukraine closely and
with concern," the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.


"Calls for a compromise in Ukraine should be heeded by all sides
in the interests of the stability of Ukrainian society," the
statement said.
