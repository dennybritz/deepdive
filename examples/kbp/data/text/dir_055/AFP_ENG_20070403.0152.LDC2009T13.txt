Briton Gary McKinnon lost his appeal Tuesday against extradition
to the United States for allegedly hacking into US defence
computers in what has been dubbed the "biggest military hack of
all time."


McKinnon, an unemployed computer expert who lost his appeal in
the High Court, said he was searching for evidence of
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) when he hacked into US
computers and not intending to disrupt security.
