At least five soldiers were killed when a military helicopter
crashed into a radio tower in southern Taiwan Tuesday, the
defence ministry said.


The defence ministry added the UH-1H chopper had a capacity of
ten people, and but it was not immediately clear how many were on
board.


The helicopter, used to transport soldiers, broke into several
parts after it hit the transmitting tower during bad weather in a
mountain area in Kaohsiung county.


The cause of the accident was being investigated, it added.


All 10 people onboard were thrown out of the plane, cable news
channel ETTV reported.


The television station said six charred bodies were found in the
vicinity of the tower.
