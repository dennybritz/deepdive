A construction worker in Shanghai was killed in a subway
construction accident on Tuesday, state press reported.


The accident occurred early Tuesday when a cement structure
collapsed on his head at Shanghai's Lingling Road, a stop on the
new No. 7 metro line currently being built, Xinhua news reported,
citing police and witnesses.


The worker was killed instantly.


An investigation into the incident is underway, it said.


The deadly accident came less than a week after six workers were
killed in a cave-in at a subway site in Beijing that the
authorities have yet to explain.


The workers were building the city's No. 10 subway line, which
will connect to a separate line running directly to the Olympic
Village north of Beijing when it is finished in 2008.
