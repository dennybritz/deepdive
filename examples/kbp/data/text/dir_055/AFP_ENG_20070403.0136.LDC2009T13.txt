The US military announced on Tuesday the death of four more
troops in Iraq, including one killed in a brutal suicide truck
bombing near a school in the oil city of Kirkuk a day ago.


The soldier died from wounds when struck by the bomb which
exploded outside a police centre and a primary school in Kirkuk
on Monday, the military said.


Thirteen Iraqis, including eight schoolgirls and a toddler, were
also killed in the blast when the bomber carrying food supplies
exploded his vehicle.


Another 192 Iraqis were treated for injuries after the blast. The
military said three more US soldiers were also wounded.


Another soldier was killed on Monday in a roadside bomb blast
next to his vehicle during combat operations near Baghdad, the
military said.


A third soldier and a marine were killed in combat operations in
the western Anbar province on Monday, the military reported.


The latest fatalities brought the US military's losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion to 3,254, according to an AFP count
based on Pentagon figures.
