The next two days will be "critical" in efforts to resolve
Britain's standoff with Iran, Prime Minister Tony Blair said
Tuesday, while noting a "prospect" of progress.


"The next 48 hours will be fairly critical," Blair told Glasgow-
based Real Radio, while cautiously welcoming comments by top
Iranian official Ali Larijani, who on Monday underlined the need
for a diplomatic solution.


"That seems to offer some prospect but the most important thing
is to get these people back," he said.
