Six bystanders were hurt Tuesday when suspected Muslim rebels
hurled a grenade at a police vehicle in Indian Kashmir which
missed the target and exploded in a busy roadside market, police
said.


"Six civilians were hurt, one of them seriously, in the blast in
downtown Srinagar," police officer Pervez Ahmed said.


He said the roadside market had been sealed off and searches
launched.


Kashmir is in the grip of a 17-year-old insurgency that has left
more than 42,000 people dead by official count. Human rights
groups put the toll at 70,000, while separatists say nearly
100,000 people have died in the unrest.


India has an estimated half a million troops and paramilitary
soldiers in Kashmir, the subject of two of the three wars between
India and Pakistan since their 1947 independence from the
British.


The attack came as South Asian leaders met in the capital New
Delhi for a summit of the South Asian Association of Regional
Cooperation (SAARC). Terrorism is high on the agenda of the
summit.
