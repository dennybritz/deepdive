Liechtenstein's LGT banking group, which is controlled by the
principality's royal family, said Tuesday that its annual net
profit had increased by 25 percent to 180.8 million Swiss francs
(112 million euros, 149 million dollars) in 2006.


Total assets under administration expanded by 11.3 billion Swiss
francs to 88.0 billion Swiss francs last year, including new
assets of 7.5 billion Swiss francs, LGT Group said in a
statement.


Liechtenstein's royal bank, which has offices in 14 countries,
said it would continue its expansion following the opening of a
branch in Vienna earlier this year and another scheduled in
Switzerland later in 2007.


LGT is wholly owned by the Prince of Liechtenstein Foundation and
has been controlled by the royal family for more than 70 years.
