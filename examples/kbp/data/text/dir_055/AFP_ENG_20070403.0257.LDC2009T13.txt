France's TGV fast train set a new world speed record on rails
Tuesday, hitting 574.7 kilometres per hour (357 miles per hour)
on a specially prepared stretch of track east of Paris.


The record -- easily beating the 515.3 kph set by a TGV (Traine a
Grande Vitesse) in 1990 -- was made by an experimental version
equipped with two supercharged locomotives and extra-large
wheels.
