Melbourne has been named as the host city for the 2011 Presidents
Cup, officials said Tuesday, adding they hope World No. 1 Tiger
Woods will lead the US team.


Melbourne will become the first city outside the US to host the
competition twice, after the Royal Melbourne Golf Club was the
venue for the 24-player contest in 1998, they said.


Five-time British Open champion Peter Thomson, who led the
victorious international team in 1998, said Woods was "very keen"
on the event and likely to attend if still playing.


"He won't be that old, he might be that rich that he's given up,"
Thomson said of Woods, who will be 36 in 2011, and who has said
in the past he prefers the competition to the Ryder Cup.


Thomson said Australian Greg Norman is being lined up to lead the
international team.


The Presidents Cup, held every two years, is a matchplay team
competition which pits a US side against a group of players from
around the world, excluding Europe.


The competition will be held November 14-20, 2011, although the
exact course is yet to be announced.


The Presidents Cup was established to allow the world's best non-
European players to compete in an international team match-play
competition. The US has won four of the six previous Presidents
Cups, but lost in Melbourne in 1998 and drew in South Africa in
2003.


The 2007 Presidents Cup will be held at The Royal Montreal Golf
Club in Montreal, Canada from September 27-30.
