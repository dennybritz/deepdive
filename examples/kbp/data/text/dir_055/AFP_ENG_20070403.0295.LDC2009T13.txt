Chinese computer maker Lenovo is the world's best electronics
manufacturer for recycling waste and dealing with toxic content,
while the US firm Apple ranks the worst, the environment group
Greenpeace said on Tuesday.


In a quarterly "Green Ranking" of 14 electronics giants that was
launched last August, Lenovo has displaced the Finnish giant
Nokia at the top of the table, it said.


Sony Ericsson ranked third, Dell fourth and Samsung fifth, but
Apple is "still the bottom of the barrel," it said.


Lenovo, which bought IBM's consumer electronics division in 2005,
"offers takeback and recycling in all the countries where its
products are sold... and also reports the amount of e-waste
(electronic waste) and recycling as a percentage of its sales,"
said Greenpeace.
