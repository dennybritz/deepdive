Iran is hopeful the standoff with Britain over the detention of
15 sailors will be resolved "soon" but London must recognise that
its forces illegally entered Iranian waters, Vice President
Parviz Davoudi said on Tuesday.


"London has changed its attitude for several days now and is
acting on the basis of negotations," Davoudi told reporters in
the southern city of Bushehr where he was opening a new
installation at Iran's first nuclear power station.


"London must give guarantees and say that there was a violation
and there will be no other errors in the future. I think that the
problem heading in this direction and god willing will be
resolved soon."
