A Briton lost his appeal here Tuesday against extradition to the
United States for allegedly hacking into US defence computers in
what has been dubbed the "biggest military hack of all time."


Gary McKinnon, an unemployed computer expert who lost his appeal
in the High Court, said he was searching for evidence of
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) when he hacked into US
computers and was not intending to disrupt security.


Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Justice Goldring dismissed his
appeal, saying: "We do not find any grounds of appeal."


Using software available for download on the Internet, McKinnon
allegedly hacked into computer networks operated by NASA, the US
Army, US Navy, Department of Defence and the US Air Force from
2001 to 2002.


The estimated loss to the various military organisations, NASA
and private businesses was about 900,000 dollars (730,000 euros),
the US justice department said.


British Home Secretary John Reid last year granted a US request
to extradite him for trial, but the defendant's lawyers argued
that he had been subjected to "improper threats" and the move
would breach his human rights.


His supporters say McKinnon is being made a "scapegoat" for the
shortcomings of security policies on US military networks.
