The Estonian president on Tuesday formally asked outgoing Prime
Minister Andrus Ansip to form the next government following last
month's elections in the Baltic state.


"I nominate Andrus Ansip as candidate for prime minister and give
him the task of forming the government," President Toomas Hendrik
Ilves said in a decree.


The right-of-centre Reform Party, headed by Ansip, emerged as the
winner in the March 4 parliamentary elections.


Ansip, 50, who has been premier since 2005, is due to present his
government's programme to parliament later this week.


In order to be confirmed as head of government, he must receive
the backing of a majority of lawmakers.


Three parties -- the Reform Party, Pro Patria-Res Publica and the
Social Democratic Party -- signed a coalition agreement on Monday
to form the next government.


The three parties have a comfortable 60-vote majority in the
101-member single- chamber parliament.
