Qatar's emir on Tuesday appointed foreign minister Sheikh Hamad
bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani as prime minister following the
resignation of Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa al-Thani, the state
news agency QNA reported.


Sheikh Hamad, who also served as a first deputy premier in the
outgoing cabinet, will continue to hold the foreign affairs
portfolio in the new government, it said.


His appointment was announced by state media only minutes after
announcing the resignation of Sheikh Abdullah.
