Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Tuesday rued the
demise of the Bundesliga which he believes is no longer capable
of challenging their money- spinning counterparts in England and
Spain.


"This season has been one of the best in sporting terms for
German football but economically we are no longer capable of
fighting," Rummenigge told the business daily Handelsblatt.


Germany finished third at the 2006 World Cup, and Bayern Munich
have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League and
Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen the same stage in the UEFA
Cup.


"In the past we were the most powerful championship in this
domain, but for the past 10 years we've been resting on our
laurels, notably in terms of the marketing of our championship,"
said Rummenigge.


"When I see that television rights in other countries are
negotiated for 20 million euros and that the Premiership got 105
million euros from Hong Kong, we will not catch England."


Club president Franz Beckenbauer added: "Bayern doesn't have the
money to win the Champions League, which doesn't stop them from
having a chance of making a name for themselves."
