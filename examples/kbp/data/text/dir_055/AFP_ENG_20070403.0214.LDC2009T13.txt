Australian Libby Lenton set a world-beating women's 100-metre
freestyle time of 52.99 seconds Tuesday, a mark expected to be
ratified as a new world record, swimming officials said.


Lenton swam the time at the annual Duel in the Pool between
Australia and the United States, considered an unusual meet as
the freestyler raced against US superstar Michael Phelps.


Lenton swam the time 0.31 seconds under German Britta Steffen's
previous world mark, as the lead swimmer in a mixed relay between
Australia and the United States.


Swimming officials were initially concerned that Phelps may have
been pacing Lenton.


But Swimming Australia spokesman David Lyall said there was no
reason to believe the record would not stand.


"We've spoken to FINA and they said they expected the record to
be ratified,' Lyall said, referring to the sport's governing
body.


"We won't know for certain tonight but we are confident it will
stand as a record," he said.


Steffen swam 53.30 seconds at the European Championships in
August 2006.


Lenton said she was "stoked" after becoming the first woman to go
under 53 seconds.


"I just went out to have fun and I got to swim against the best
in the world," she said.


Lenton picked up five gold medals at the World Championships in
Melbourne last week to be the most successful female swimmer at
the meet.
