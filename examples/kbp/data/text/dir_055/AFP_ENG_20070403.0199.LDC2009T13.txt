Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Tuesday lost an appeal
against a decision by the electoral commission to bar him from
this month's presidential election.


An appeals court in Abuja ruled that Nigeria's Independent
Electoral Commission does have the power to disqualify a
candidate from running in the April 21 election.


"It is my considered view that not only has the appelant (the
electoral commission) the power to screen and disqualify
candidates but to remove the name of candidates without recourse
to court," a statement read by one of the judges, Rabiu Danlami
Mohammad, said.
