Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Tuesday that Britain would have
to take "increasingly tougher decisions" if Iran did not release
15 captive sailors as soon as possible.


Speaking in Glasgow, he said the government has had "two very
clear tracks" throughout the crisis.


"One is to try and settle this by way of peaceful, calm
negotiation, get our people back as quickly as possible... The
other is to make it clear that if that's not possible, then we
have to take increasingly tougher decisions," Blair declared.


"I'm not going to say any more at the moment -- it's for the
Iranian government now to come back with their response," he
said.


Earlier Blair had said that the next two days will be crucial in
the standoff.


"The next 48 hours will be fairly critical," Blair told Glasgow-
based Real Radio, while cautiously welcoming comments by top
Iranian official Ali Larijani, who on Monday underlined the need
for a diplomatic solution.


"I've read the transcripts of the interview (Larijani) gave and
that seems to offer some prospect but the most important thing is
to get these people back," he said.
