Egyptian police have detained a prominent Islamist lawyer they
suspect of financing the Al-Qaeda terror network in the region,
judicial sources said.


Mamduh Ismail, a former member of the extremist Jihad group, was
arrested on Thursday, an official in the judiciary told AFP late
Monday on condition of anonymity.


He is accused of "financing Al-Qaeda in Egypt, in Yemen and
Algeria, on the instructions of Ayman al-Zawahiri," the network's
Egyptian second-in-command, the official said.


The Jihad organisation was responsible for the assassination of
president Anwar Sadat in 1981, over which Ismail himself was held
for three years before being cleared in court.
