The international Red Cross on Tuesday condemned a bus bombing on
Sri Lanka's eastern coast which left 16 people dead, including
three children, and injured 25 others.


"The International Committee of the Red Cross deplores the
civilian casualties caused by an attack yesterday on a civilian
bus in Ambalangoda, Ampara district," it said in a statement.


"The ICRC is deeply concerned about the rising number of
civilians being injured or killed as a result of deliberate
attacks in Sri Lanka's escalating violence," said Toon
Vandenhove, head of the ICRC delegation in Colombo.


Sri Lanka's defence ministry accused Tamil Tiger rebels of
setting off the blast, which coincided with a key Buddhist
holiday, while the guerrillas denied they were responsible for
the attack against civilians.


Passengers were getting off the bus to be checked by troops
manning a road block when the blast occurred just outside the
town of Ampara, 350 kilometres (220 miles) east of Colombo, a
local police officer said.


The ICRC urged all parties to the conflict to respect
international humanitarian law, which prohibits direct attacks
against civilians and civilian objects in all circumstances.
