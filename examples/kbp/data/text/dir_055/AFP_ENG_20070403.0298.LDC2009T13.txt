A British minister announced Tuesday a 36.5 million pound (71.8
million dollar) aid package of debt relief and cash to help fund
Nepal's peace process.


"This is the first real chance to bring peace to Nepal during the
last decade," said international development minister Gareth
Thomas.


London will give 13 million pounds (25.6 million dollars) to the
Nepali government-led Peace Trust Fund and offer at least 23.5
million pounds (46.2 million dollars) in debt relief on World
Bank loans over the next eight years, a statement said.


Thomas arrived in Kathmandu on Monday, a day after five former
rebel Maoists were sworn into a new interim cabinet cementing a
peace deal that ended 10 years of bloody civil war.


Thomas met with Maoist members of parliament and was scheduled to
meet the Maoist's second-in-command Baburam Bhattarai.


At least 13,000 people died in Nepal's civil war which destroyed
the economy of one of the poorest nations on the planet.
