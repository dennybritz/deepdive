A plane carrying Japan's finance minister made a safe emergency
landing Tuesday in the southern city of Fukuoka after a problem
with its engine, officials said.


The Japan Airlines jet was carrying 259 passengers including
Finance Minister Koji Omi from Tokyo when the engine stopped
working, an official of the transport ministry office in Fukuoka
said.


Television footage showed the Boeing 777 slowly approaching and
making a careful landing without incident in Fukuoka.


"They landed safely and there were no injuries," said Masaaki
Tsuda, a spokesman of the Fukuoka office of Japan Airlines.


"During the flight, a sign flashed that showed possible trouble
with an engine so the crew decided to cut off the engine," he
told AFP.


Omi was heading to Fukuoka for activities unrelated to his job as
finance minister, a ministry spokesman said without further
explanation.


It was the latest aviation incident in Japan.


Last month, an All Nippon Airways Bombardier DHC-8 made an
emergency landing on its belly at a regional airport after its
front wheels failed to open.


The incident led the transport ministry to order checks on the
landing gear of all 36 Bombardier DHC-8 planes in operation in
Japan.


Japan Airlines has been hit hard by a series of safety incidents
that have scared away passengers.


In an incident in 2005, three passengers were injured when the
front tyres of a JAL plane came off on landing in Tokyo.
