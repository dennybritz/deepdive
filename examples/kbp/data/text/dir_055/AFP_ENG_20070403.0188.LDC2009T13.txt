The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the nation's largest
lender, said Tuesday its net profit rose 31 percent last year as
a rapidly expanding economy kept its lending business growing
fast.


The bank reported net profit in 2006 of 49.3 billion yuan (6.4
billion dollars), up from 37.6 billion yuan in 2005, according to
a statement.


The net profit was slightly lower than market expectations, which
were for a profit of around 52 billion yuan.


Retail banking and loans to small enterprises were among the
items helping to boost the bank's revenues, it said.


"Retail banking is not only an area in which the bank is strong
traditionally but also one of the strategic businesses, and key
to the sustainability of the bank's strong financial
performance," it said.


The bank said it had over 170 million retail banking customers at
the end of 2006.
