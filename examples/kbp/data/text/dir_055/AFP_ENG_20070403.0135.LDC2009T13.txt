Sri Lankan security forces have killed at least 23 Tamil Tiger
rebels in fresh fighting in the island's east following a deadly
bus bombing, the defence ministry claimed Tuesday.


"In the limited humanitarian operation on the west and south of
Batticaloa, we have found 10 bodies of the LTTE cadres,"
spokesman Prasad Samarasinghe said. "Altogether, 23 Tigers have
been killed in the fighting yesterday."


He said one soldier was also killed in the confrontation.


Last week the government said its troops had moved into the
restive area without meeting any guerrilla resistance.


The claim came a day after 16 people were killed and 25 wounded
when a bomb blast ripped through a bus in the island's east.


The defence ministry immediately accused Tamil Tiger rebels of
setting off the bomb, which coincided with a key Buddhist
holiday, while the guerrillas denied they were responsible.
