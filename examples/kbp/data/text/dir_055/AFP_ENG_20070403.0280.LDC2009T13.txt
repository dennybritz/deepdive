Five army officers were killed and three others are missing after
a military helicopter crashed into a radio tower in southern
Taiwan Tuesday, the defence ministry said.


The UH-1H chopper lost contact with the control tower at 4:28 pm
(0928 GMT), 36 minutes after it took off from the southern Kuijen
airbase for a training drill, the ministry said in a statement.


Among the deaths were army colonel Chen Ming-tung, head of the
army's 601 Airborne Special Force Brigade, as well as two
lieutenant-colonels, an army major and a master sergeant.


Hundreds of soldiers have been mobilised to search for a missing
army colonel and two army majors in the mishap, army commanding
general Chao Shih-chang told reporters.


The ministry said initial investigation showed that the ill-fated
helicopter might have hit the transmitting tower during bad
weather in a mountain area in Kaohsiung county, although the
investigation is ongoing.
