The Ukrainian parliament was officially dissolved Tuesday
following publication of a decree signed by President Viktor
Yushchenko, the president's office said.


Legislators have vowed to defy the dissolution order, which
Yushchenko's office said was published in a special edition of
the president's "official bulletin".
