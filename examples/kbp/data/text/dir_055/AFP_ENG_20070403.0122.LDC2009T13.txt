A plane carrying Japan's finance minister safely made an
emergency landing Tuesday in the southern city of Fukuoka after a
problem with its engine, officials and reports said.


The Japan Airlines Boeing 777 was carrying 270 passengers
including Finance Minister Koji Omi when an engine stopped
working, an official said.


Television footage showed the plane slowly approaching and making
a careful landing without incident in Fukuoka.


"The plane has safely landed," an official at the transport
ministry office at Fukuoka's airport told AFP.


Omi was on board the plane, a finance ministry spokesman said.
