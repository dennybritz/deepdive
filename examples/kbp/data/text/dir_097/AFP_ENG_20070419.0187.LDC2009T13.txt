Veteran directors Quentin Tarantino, Emir Kusturica, Gus Van Sant
and Wong Kar Wai will be vying against a large group of upcoming
young filmmakers for the top prize at this year's Cannes film
festival, organisers revealed Thursday.


The mix of old and new in the list of the 21 films competing for
the prestigious Palme d'Or reflected efforts by the cinema event
-- the biggest in the world -- to remain fresh as it celebrates
its 60th year.
