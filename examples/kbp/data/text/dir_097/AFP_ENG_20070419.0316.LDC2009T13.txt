A false bomb threat targetting a Norwegian bus on Thursday
brought traffic on part of a major highway in southern Norway to
a standstill, Norwegian police said.


The alert caused the closure of a stretch of the E18 motorway
linking the capital Oslo with the southwestern town of Stavanger
was closed in both directions near Songe around 9:00 am (0700
GMT).


An anonymous caller had said there was a bomb on board a bus
carrying about 50 people, of whom 30 were high school students.


Police evacuated the passengers but a bomb squad flown in by
helicopter turned up nothing.


The motorway was reopened early in the afternoon, but although
traffic was rerouted during the incident, major jams were
reported.


An 18-year-old man suspected of making the anonymous phone call
has been arrested.
