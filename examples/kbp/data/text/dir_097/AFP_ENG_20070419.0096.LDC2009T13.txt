Europe's main stock markets extended losses in opening deals on
Thursday, with the heaviest falls seen on the leading indices in
Frankfurt and Paris.


London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares eased 0.07 percent to
6,444.70 points, Frankfurt's DAX 30 slid 1.05 percent to 7,205.53
points and in Paris the CAC 40 index shed 0.93 percent to
5,781.53.


Companies in the eurozone are being hurt by a strong European
single currency, which is making exports more expensive,
especially for buyers making transactions with the weak dollar.
