The United States has made a four-plank offer to Russia to help
ease its fears about US plans for a missile shield in Europe, a
NATO official said Thursday.


The US offered to share early warning data about missile threats,
proposed inter-operability between US and Russian missile
systems, committed to holding joint exercises and suggested ideas
for a new partnership, the official said.


The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not
elaborate.


The offer was made by a US delegation on Tuesday, ahead of talks
at NATO headquarters in Brussels between senior NATO and Russian
officials on Thursday.


Washington announced in January plans to extend its anti-missile
shield into Europe, but the move to install interceptors in
Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic have angered
Russia.
