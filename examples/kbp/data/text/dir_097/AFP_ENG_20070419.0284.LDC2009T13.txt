The Romanian parliament voted on Thursday to suspend President
Traian Basescu in a first step to impeaching him, one of the MPs
who voted for the measure said.


Opposition members say Basescu violated the constitution by
acting in a partisan way and violating his role as mediator. A
total of 322 members of parliament voted for his suspension, with
108 voting against. Ten abstained.
