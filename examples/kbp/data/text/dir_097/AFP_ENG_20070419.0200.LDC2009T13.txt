German fixed telecom network operator Versatel said on Thursday
that its flotation shares would be priced at 29-36 euros, valuing
the issue at up to 1.028 billion euros (1.39 billion dollars).


The so-called book-building range, an indicative price range at
which investors can apply for shares, had been set at 29-36
euros, with the final price to be announced on April 26, Versatel
said in a statement.


With a total 28.577 million shares being sold, the issue would
raise between 828 million euros and 1.028 billion euros in all,
making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in Germany
this year.


About 14 million shares would come from a capital increase, while
Versatel's current owners, private equity firm Apax Partners,
would sell a further 10.85 million shares. And an additional
3.727 million shares could be placed via a so- called greenshoe
or over-allotment option if demand is sufficiently strong.


The shares are scheduled to begin trading on the stock exchange
from April 27.


Apax currently holds a 96-percent stake in Versatel, the fourth-
biggest fixed network operator in Germany behind Deutsche
Telekom, Acror and Hansenet.


Versatel chief Peer Knauer has reportedly earmarked around one
third of total funds raised in acquisitions and investment, and
the rest in debt reduction.
