Opposition politicians hit out Thursday at a compensation award
of nearly 600,000 pounds (884,000 euros, 1.2 million dollars) to
the firm at the centre of a bird flu outbreak in Britain.


Bernard Matthews, which owns the poultry processing plant hit by
the potentially lethal H5N1 virus in February, is being handed
the cash because nearly 160,000 of its turkeys were culled as a
precaution.


Compensation is offered in such circumstances as an incentive to
report disease early, said an environment department spokesman.


But the environment spokesman for the main opposition
Conservatives criticised the pay-out.


"Bearing in mind that there must have been a serious failure of
bio-security at the Bernard Matthews plant, many people will be
absolutely astonished that no one will be held responsible for
the outbreak," Peter Ainsworth said.


"Instead, the company will receive 589,356.89 pounds in
compensation funded by the taxpayer."


Poultry imports from Hungary, where Bernard Matthews has a
subsidiary -- and where a virtually identical bird flu strain was
found in January -- are the most plausible source of the
outbreak, say government officials.


The Food Standards Agency decided earlier this month that there
was insufficient evidence to take legal action against the firm,
a decision also that the Conservatives also criticised.


Bernard Matthews maintains that it acted "with the utmost
integrity" throughout the crisis.


It has also called for wider testing of wild birds in Britain.
