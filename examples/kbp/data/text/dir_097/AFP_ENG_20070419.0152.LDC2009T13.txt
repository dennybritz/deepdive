Prudential, the second-biggest insurance group in Britain,
reported on Thursday an eight-percent jump in sales of new
policies during the first quarter, helped by a strong performance
in Asia.


New sales of life-insurance and pension policies climbed to 640
million pounds (955 million euros, 1.28 billion dollars) in the
first three months of 2007 compared with the first quarter in
2006, Prudential said in a trading update.


Analysts had expected sales of 613 million pounds, according to a
consensus forecast supplied by the company ahead of the update.


"We continue to see excellent prospects across the group and we
will pursue these opportunities aggressively with a clear focus
on value creation," Prudential chief executive Mark Tucker said
in a statement.


Prudential said that in Asia sales jumped by 34 percent to 277
million pounds during the first quarter.


"Prudential has an excellent track record of building profitable
businesses in Asia and its focus continues to be on profitable
and sustainable long-term growth," the company statement said.


The Asian success outweighed a sharp downturn in Britain, where
first-quarter sales fell 23 percent on the year to 183 million
pounds.


Prudential said the decline largely reflected an exceptional 66
million-pound gain, made during the first quarter of 2006, that
was not repeated this year.


Prudential added that its US sales rose 21 percent to 180 million
pounds during the first three months of 2007.
