Jorge Linares of Venezuela will fight against Oscar Larios of
Mexico for the World Boxing Council featherweight "interim" title
next month, his handlers said Thursday.


Linares, who has 144 wins against six defeats in his amateur
career, made his professional debut in December 2002 and has
chalked up a 23 straight wins, including 14 KOs, against no
defeats.


"I have studied many of Oscar's fights. I have no problem
fighting against him," said Linares, 21, who is ranked second by
the WBC and is based out of a Japanese gym.


The 30-year-old Larios, the former WBC super bantam champion, has
59 wins, including 37 KOs, against five defeats and a draw. He is
ranked number one by the WBC.


The bout will take place in Anaheim, California, on May 26, they
said.


Current title-holder Chi In-Jin of South Korea could not fight
his first defence of the title due to an injury, and he must
fight the winner of the Larios- Linares battle to keep the title.
