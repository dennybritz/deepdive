China's economy grew 11.1 percent in the first quarter of 2007
compared with the same period a year earlier, the National Bureau
of Statistics said Thursday.


The growth in the first three months of the year is likely to
have been boosted by a yawning trade surplus and massive
investment in infrastructure.


Growth in the world's fourth-largest economy reached 10.7 percent
in full-year 2006 and ran at 10.4 percent in the three months to
December.


The government has set a growth target of eight percent for the
year of 2007 as a whole.


Analysts had expected the economy to pick up speed in the first
quarter, with most forecasts at around 11 percent.
