Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov rejected on
Thursday an overture from the United States to cooperate on
building a missile shield in Europe, Russian news agencies
reported.


"I honestly see no basis for speaking of possible cooperation on
a strategic missile shield," Ivanov said.
