Sri Lankan war planes bombed suspected Tamil Tiger gun positions
in the island's north for a third straight day Thursday, the
defence ministry said.


Two attacks were carried out against the rebel Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the Jaffna peninsula and at
Puthukkudiriruppu, the ministry said, adding that they hit Tiger
gun positions.


"The air force claims both locations were completely destroyed in
the attacks, resulting in heavy damage to the LTTE," the ministry
said.


It did not detail what damage was caused. There was no immediate
word from the Tigers about the aerial strikes.


More than 4,000 people were killed between December 2005 and the
first week of March 2007 across the island, including 675
civilians and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence
ministry figures.


The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
