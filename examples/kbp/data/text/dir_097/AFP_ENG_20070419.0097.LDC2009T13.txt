A dam in northwest China's Gansu province burst on Thursday,
flooding surrounding farmland and two villages downstream,
officials and state media reported on Thursday.


Rescue teams had been dispatched to evacuate residents downstream
from the Xiaohaizi reservoir in Gaotai county but it was still
not known whether there were any casualties, the report by Xinhua
news agency said.


"It happened at 12:30 pm (0430GMT) today and all (government)
staff here have gone to the scene," an official with the Gaotai
county government told AFP.


One official said Mingyun and Mingshui village had been affected
but could not provide further details as teams inspecting the
remote area had yet to report back.


Xu Dongbo, a government official from nearby Nanhua township,
said that recent heavy rains could be to blame for the rupture.
