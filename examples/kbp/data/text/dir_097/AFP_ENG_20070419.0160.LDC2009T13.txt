Ailing Argentine football star Diego Maradona is in stable
condition and will be discharged from hospital when he recovers
from his latest bout of hepatitis, his doctors said.


Maradona, "is clinically stable and persists in his positive
development," the private Los Arcos clinic in Buenos Aires said
in a statement Wednesday.


He will stay there "a few more days until his hepatitis analysis
normalizes completely," Maradona's personal doctor Alfredo Cahe
told the Continental radio station.


The ex-Argentina World Cup captain and Barcelona star was rushed
to the clinic six days ago complaining of severe abdominal pain,
just two days after being discharged from a different clinic
where he was treated for two weeks for illness brought on by
excessive drinking.


Doctors said Tuesday Maradona had recovered enough to possibly
allow him to continue his treatment for alcohol abuse at home.
The clinic had earlier  warned of abnormalities in his liver
functions.


He has seen his career on and off the football pitch marred by
repeated drug and alcohol abuse and was also hospitalized in 2000
and 2004 for heart attacks provoked by cocaine overdoses.
