Two Israeli soldiers were lightly wounded on Thursday by
Palestinian fire near the city of Ramallah in the occupied West
Bank, the army said.


The soldiers were wounded after the car they were driving south
of Ramallah came under fire, a spokesman said.


The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a militant group loosely affiliated
with president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, claimed responsibility
for the shooting in a statement released in Gaza.
