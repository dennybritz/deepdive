Police detained five more suspects over the murder of three
people at a Christian publishing house in this eastern city,
Malatya governor Halil Ibrahim Dasoz said Thursday.


The latest arrests brought to 10 the total number of suspects in
custody over Wednesday's killings in Malatya, a conservative city
650 kilometres (400 miles) east of Ankara, the governor said in
televised remarks.


Five of the suspects, including a man who jumped out of a window
to escape capture, were caught at the publishing house, which had
received threats for distributing Bibles and publishing other
Christian literature.


Dasoz did not give details on the other suspects, but said they
were all of the same age group:  young men aged 19 and 20 years,
according to the Turkish press.


Newspapers said all the suspects detained at the crime scene were
found be carrying a letter that read: "We did it for our country.
They are trying to take our country away, take our religion
away."


Dasoz refused to give further details on the investigation.


The three victims, one of them a German, were found tied to
chairs with their throats slit.


The gruesome killings appeared to be the latest in a recent
series of attacks on minorities in Turkey, including the murders
of a Roman Catholic priest last year and of a prominent ethnic
Armenian journalist in January.
