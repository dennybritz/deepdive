Germany's top economic research institutes sharply upgraded their
forecasts for growth this year and next year to 2.4 percent on
Thursday.


They also predicted that Germany, with the biggest economy in the
eurozone, would achieve a balanced budget by 2008.


Growth of German gross domestic product (GDP) was project to slow
only slightly in 2007 and 2008 from the 2.7 percent recorded in
2006, the five institutes said in their traditional spring report
released Thursday.


And robust economic growth would enable Germany to cut its public
deficit from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to just 0.6 percent this
year and then achieve a balanced budget in 2008, the report said.
