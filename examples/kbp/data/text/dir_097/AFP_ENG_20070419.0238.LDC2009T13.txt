Tribal elders forced a teenage boy to wear a garland of shoes
after he persistently pestered girls at a local Islamic school in
northwestern Pakistan, officials said Thursday.


Gulab Noor, 17, an Afghan refugee, was also ordered to pay a fine
of 30,000 rupees (500 dollars) by elders on the outskirts of
Peshawar, local welfare organisation chief Roshan Khan said.


The boy used to harass girls from a local madrassa, or religious
school, and tell them that he would either marry them or kidnap
them, causing several of them to stay away from classes, Khan
said.


"Their relatives brought him to my office and a jury of elders
ordered him to wear a garland of shoes around his neck," said
Khan.


Exposing the soles of your shoes is a sign of disrespect in south
Asia. Protesters last week beat pictures of President Pervez
Musharraf with their footwear in rallies against the removal of
Pakistan's chief justice.


Tribal punishments are common in Pakistan, particularly in rural
areas and in the conservative northwest which bordering
Afghanistan.


In March, Islamic extremists in the Khyber tribal region stoned
then shot dead two men and a woman for alleged adultery.
