Hong Kong share prices closed 2.30 percent lower Thursday as
profit-taking gathered pace after China's economic data
reinforced worries that mainland authorities may take further
measures to rein in surging growth, dealers said.


They said investors were concerned credit-tightening measures
could include another interest rate hike after the release of
robust economic data.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 477.38 points at 20,299.71, off a
low of 20,232.81 and a high of 20,634.90. Turnover was heavy at
62.99 billion Hong Kong dollars (8.1 billion US).


Data released Thursday showed that China's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 11.1 percent year-on-year in the three months to
March, compared with 10.4 percent in the fourth quarter and 10.7
percent for 2006.


"Investors are worried that if China is growing too fast, there
would be further measures to slow down the economy," said Jackson
Wong, investment manager at Tanrich Securities.


"China normally announces new monetary measures on a Friday, so
this could happen again tomorrow," he said. "If not tomorrow, I
believe it would happen sooner or later," he said.


Wong said although the data was in line with market expectations,
he believed the market has not yet seen its full impact.


"We will have to wait and see how investors would digest today's
data," he said.


Dealers said fears of a major correction on the mainland's
A-share markets and a big drop on the Japanese bourse also
weighed on sentiment.
