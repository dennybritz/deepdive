Chinese share prices slumped 4.52 percent Thursday as concerns
about possible tightening measures aimed at slowing the runaway
economy prompted profit-taking after recent record gains, dealers
said.


They said investors cashed out ahead of first-quarter economic
growth figures that were released only minutes after the close.


The data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed
China's economy grew 11.1 percent in the first quarter of 2007,
picking up sharply from 10.4 percent in the last three months of
2006.


Analyst forecasts had been for around 11 percent growth as the
economy ran ahead even faster despite a whole series of measures
by the government to slow it to a more sustainable pace.


Growth in the world's fourth-largest economy reached 10.7 percent
in 2006.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares closed down 163.38 points at 3,449.02.
