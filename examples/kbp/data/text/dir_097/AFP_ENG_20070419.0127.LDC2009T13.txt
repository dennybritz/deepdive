Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Thursday that any
attempts to unilaterally recognise the independence of Kosovo
could destabilise Serbia and the Balkan region.


"We are very much interested in the stability of the Balkans and
Serbia and that stability could be violated by any attempt to
unilaterally recognise the independence of Kosovo," Lavrov said
told reporters in Belgrade after meeting with Serbian President
Boris Tadic.
