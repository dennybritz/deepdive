Danish ambassador Torben Brylle was appointed the European
Union's special representative for Sudan as of May, the Danish
foreign ministry announced in a statement on Thursday.


The 58-year-old diplomat will coordinate the work of the EU in
Sudan and represent the bloc in negotiations with the Sudanese
government.


Brylle is presently the Danish ambassador to Egypt, a post that
also covers Sudan, and has previously been stationed in South
Africa.


The EU is the main contributor to the peace efforts in Sudan. It
has supported the African Union's Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with
some 400 million euros (544 dollars) so far and has reserved
another 360 million for the humanitarian crisis in Sudan.


Some 200,000 people have been killed in the region since civil
war erupted there in 2003, according to the UN figures.


Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller welcomed the appointment
and said the post "is essential both for Denmark and for the EU
... involved in this severe crisis in Darfur."


He added: "The EU must maintain international attention and
pressure on the government in Khartoum to respect the signed
peace agreements, including the deployment of a joint United
Nations and African Union (peacekeeping) force."


Khartoum on Monday agreed to the deployment of 3,000 UN staff,
mainly military personnel and police as well as six attack
helicopters to support the 7,000 soldiers from the African Union
currently in Darfur.
