Manchester City defender Micah Richards will miss England's Euro
2008 qualifier with Estonia on June 6 because of an ankle injury,
his club coach Stuart Pearce said on Thursday.


Richards picked up the injury while playing for his country in
their last qualifier against Andorra last month.


He also requires a calf operation at the end of the season and
Pearce is currently trying to decide when to send the teenager
for surgery.


But, whether he plays again for City this season or not, Richards
will definitely not be available for international duty.


"We will decide in the next day or so, when his ankle has settled
down, when Micah is likely to play again," Pearce said.


"If it is not going to be until the last week of the season, and
we have a fully fit defence, it is quite possible we will bring
the operation forward.


"Either way, he will not be playing for England this summer. On
this occasion, the club has to take priority."
