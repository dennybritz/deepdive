Finland's new centre-right coalition government, the most female-
dominated cabinet in the world with 60 percent women, was
formally appointed by President Tarja Halonen on Thursday.


Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen's cabinet will consist of his
Centre Party, the conservatives, the Greens and the Swedish
People's Party.


Together the parties will occupy 125 of the 200 seats in the
unicameral Finnish parliament Eduskunta.


The Centre Party won the March 18 elections with a one-seat
advantage over the conservative National Coalition Party. The two
parties will each hold eight portfolios in the new cabinet, while
the Greens and the Swedish People's Party will each hold two
portfolios.


The cabinet will consist of 12 women and eight men, which
according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a world
record.


The women ministers will be in charge of the portfolios of
agriculture, transport, health, environment, interior, education,
justice, labour and European affairs and immigration, among
others.


Vanhanen's previous centre-left government consisting of the
Centre Party, Social Democrats and the Swedish People's Party
held office from 2003.
