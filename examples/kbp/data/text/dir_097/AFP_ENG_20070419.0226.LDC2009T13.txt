US special forces and Afghan troops killed 24 Taliban militants
and destroyed four rebel vehicles in a seven-hour battle in
southern Afghanistan, the US-led coalition said Thursday.


The clash happened overnight in the Sangin district of troubled
Helmand province, which Afghan and coalition forces said they had
seized back from insurgent control almost two weeks ago.


"Approximately 24 Taliban fighters were killed and four vehicles
destroyed during the prolonged seven-hour battle," a coalition
statement said.
