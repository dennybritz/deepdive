Two Philippine journalists narrowly escaped death after being
ambushed by gunmen on Thursday in the latest in a string of
attacks on the press, a media watchdog said.


Delfin Mallari a correspondent for the Philippine Daily Inquirer
and Johnny Glorioso of radio station DZMM, were shot at by two
men on a motorcycle on a highway south of Manila, the National
Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) said.


Mallari suffered a gunshot wound to the body and was taken to
hospital, while Glorioso was unhurt.


Prior to the attack, Mallari said he received death threats and
the two journalists said they had suspicions on who was behind
the attack but declined to reveal details, the NUJP said.


Police would not immediately confirm the report.


The ambush came a day after Carmelo Palacios, a correspondent of
a government- run radio station was shot dead in northern Nueva
Ecija province.


He was the second journalist murdered this year.


Last year 12 media men and women were murdered in the course of
their work, the National Union of Journalists said.


A spate of unsolved killings of journalists has made the
Philippines the most dangerous place for news professionals next
to Iraq, media watchdogs say.
