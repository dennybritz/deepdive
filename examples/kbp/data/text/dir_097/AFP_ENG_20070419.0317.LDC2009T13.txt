India aims to boost exports by nearly 30 percent to 160 billion
dollars in this financial year despite a surging currency, the
government said on Thursday.


India had met its export target of 125 billion dollars for the
year to March 31, 2007 and set a goal of 160 billion dollars for
this fiscal year, Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said.


The government was aiming for 200 billion dollars in exports for
the following year, he said.


The upbeat outlook came despite the Indian rupee's rise of more
than five percent against the dollar since the start of the year
on the back of strong foreign investment in India and broad-based
pressure on the US currency.


The increase in the rupee's value against the dollar has upset
exporters, especially India's flagship outsourcing industry,
which makes most of its sales to the United States.


"We have factored in the appreciation of rupee which keeps on
fluctuating. We have already requested (the central) Reserve Bank
of India to provide concessional loans to exporters," Nath told a
news conference.


The rupee reached its highest level in nine years against the
dollar this week. It ended Thursday at 42.10 to the greenback.


The minister said the country received foreign direct investment
inflows of 16 billion dollars in 2006-07 compared with 5.5
billion dollars in the previous year.


If re-invested earnings were included, FDI inflows would touch 19
billion dollars, he said.
