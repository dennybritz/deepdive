Newcastle striker Michael Owen has a 50-50 chance of being handed
the opportunity to wreck Chelsea's Premiership title hopes on
Sunday, Magpies boss Glenn Roeder revealed on Thursday.


The England forward has been sidelined since suffering a serious
knee injury during the World Cup last year but is now close to
making his comeback, although a minor groin problem could delay
it until the trip to Reading on April 30.


"At this stage, I have not even discussed it with Michael as to
whether he will be back for us on Sunday," Roeder said.


"He is 50-50, but he will not return until in my opinion he is in
pristine condition - and he has had a slight groin strain which
he picked up in shooting practice at the end of last week.


"His groin is a bit sore, but that is what happens when players
have been out for a long time, they pick up niggles in other
parts of their body.


"At the moment, we are being very careful with Michael, as we
would with any other player.


"He certainly has not been ruled out of the Chelsea game but, if
in the end he is, then we will start looking to our next match at
Reading."


Since suffering his injury, Owen, 27, has had two bouts of knee
surgery in the United States and his only playing action has been
70 minutes in a closed-doors friendly against Scottish side
Gretna last Tuesday.
