Rakuten, Japan's largest online shopping mall operator, said
Thursday that it aimed to raise its stake in Tokyo Broadcasting
System Inc (TBS) to more than 20 percent.


Rakuten, which currently has a 19.86 percent stake, notified TBS
of its intentions.


Rakuten has been rapidly expanding its operation through mergers
and acquisitions since it was established in 1997.


In 2005 the company launched a hostile bid for control of TBS, a
major terrestrial broadcasting company, but eventually gave up
amid strong opposition from TBS management.
