China's consumer price index rose 2.7 percent in the first
quarter of 2007 from a year earlier, and was up 3.3 percent in
March alone, the government said Thursday.


The government is targetting an inflation rate within three
percent this year in the fast growing economy.


Consumer inflation is one of the key measures that the central
bank monitors when deciding what monetary measures to adopt.
