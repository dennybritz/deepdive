Chinese Pemier Wen Jiabao has called for measures to rein in
excessively fast growth in the nation's trade surplus, the
government said Thursday.


Wen told a meeting of the State Council, or Cabinet, Wednesday
that steps should be taken to reduce "unreasonable" preferential
policies for the export sector, the government said in a
statement on its website.


China's trade surplus totalled 46.4 billion dollars in the first
three months of the year, about double the figure in the same
period of last year.
