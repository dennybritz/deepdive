A North Korean delegation headed by Vice Foreign Minister Kim
Yong-Il embarked on a tour of Asian states Thursday,  official
media said.


The  Korean Central News Agency did not specify which countries
the delegation would visit or for what purpose, but the team was
seen off by envoys from Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Iran at
the airport.


North Korea and Iran are in a standoff with the West over their
nuclear ambitions. The two countries have closely cooperated in
the past on developing ballistic missiles, US officials say.


A multinational nuclear disarmament deal with North Korea is in
limbo due to a row over 25 million dollars in its funds which was
frozen at a Macau bank.


Under the first phase the North was supposed by last Saturday to
have shut down and sealed its Yongbyon reactor, which produces
the raw material for plutonium to make bombs.


It missed the deadline because of delays in freeing up the
accounts which had been frozen at US instigation since 2005.


The United States said the money was made available last week.


But there has been no word on when the cash transfer will be made
nor notification of when North Korea will begin shutting down the
reactor.
