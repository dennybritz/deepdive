Extra police deployed Thursday as Ukraine's constitutional court
resumed hearings into the standoff between the ex-Soviet
republic's president and prime minister over dissolving
parliament and calling early elections.


Thousands of people from both sides of Ukraine's political divide
demonstrated outside the court in Kiev, although police ensured
there was no repeat of Wednesday's chaos when protestors
prevented judges from entering the building for an hour.


Police reinforcements and a metal fence now separate rival
supporters of President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister
Viktor Yanukovych.


The constitutional court is to rule on whether Yushchenko's
dissolution of parliament and call for new elections earlier this
month was legal. Hearings began on Tuesday and no date has been
set for a decision.


The court is being closely watched by outside powers, anxious
about the political direction of this country of 47 million
people located between the European Union and NATO to the west
and Russia to the east.


Both Yushchenko and Yanukovych say they will respect the court's
decision. However, tensions are running high, with both camps
regularly sending thousands of supporters out on to the streets.


On Thursday, Yushchenko cancelled a planned trip to western
Ukraine because of the "political situation," his office said,
Interfax reported.


Yanukovych was in Poland meeting with President Lech Kaczynski
and Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
