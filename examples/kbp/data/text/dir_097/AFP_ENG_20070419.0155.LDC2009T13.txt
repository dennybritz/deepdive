Nigeria's presidential election, threatened with an opposition
boycott, will take place on Saturday as planned, an official with
the electoral commission said.


"The election is holding; no doubt about it," electoral
commission spokesman Segun Adeogun told AFP.


The Nigerian government has already given assurances that the
election will take place on the scheduled date, despite the
boycott threat.


Eighteen opposition parties earlier this week called for the
disbanding of the election commission and demanded that
Saturday's presidential ballot be postponed until "transparency
and fairness" could be ensured.


They also called for the annulment of last Saturday's regional
polls, which international observers described as marred by fraud
and which triggered violence that left at least 20 dead.


The United States on Wednesday called on the opposition parties
not to carry out their boycott.


But the State Department also urged Nigeria's government to take
"immediate and comprehensive" action to prevent electoral
misconduct and irregularities ahead of Saturday's polls.


"We urge Nigeria's political parties to adhere to the
constitutional process and to participate in these elections,"
State Department spokeswoman Julie Reside said.


"Evidence of wrongdoing should be brought to the attention of
authorities and all parties should cooperate in the peaceful
resolution of disputes through appropriate legal means," she
said.


Nigeria currently supplies around one fifth of US oil imports.
