Roger Federer eased back into form on clay with a 6-4, 6-3 defeat
of Hyung-taik Lee to step comfortably into the quarter-finals of
the Monte Carlo Masters on Thursday.


With clouds rolling in over the Mediterranean, the top seed who
lost the 2006 final to Rafael Nadal calmly dispatched South
Korean Lee, whom he beat in their only other meeting at
Wimbledon, 2003.


The Swiss world number one required just 64 minutes to seal the
victory, producing 25 winners and 24 unforced errors in his
second outing of the season on the surface.


Federer, the winner of ten Grand Slam titles, is gearing his
season towards a possible conquest of the elusive Roland Garros
crown. He lost the French Open final a year ago to Nadal.


A potential high-profile quarter-final clash with teenaged Serb
ace Novak Djokovic was ended by David Ferrer, the Spanish 12th
seed upsetting the number six 7-5, 6-4.


Djokovic had arrived as the teenager to watch after winning the
Miami title on hardcourt three weeks ago and reaching the top ten
for the first time to stand a current seventh in the ATP
rankings.


Czech tenth seed Tomas Berdych beat Spain's number five Tommy
Robredo 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 to set up a last-eight match with Swede
Robin Soderling, who eliminated big- hitting Max Mirnyi from
Belarus 7-6 (7/5), 6-2.


Holder and second seed Nadal was aiming to extend his unbeaten
clay streak to 64 matches as he faced Belgian Kristof Vliegen
later.
