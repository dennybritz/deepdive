The fortunes of Russia's 100 richest people leapt by over a third
in 2006, growing nearly six times faster than the economy as a
whole, the Russian edition of Forbes magazine said on Thursday.


The total wealth of the "golden hundred" hit 337 billion dollars
(248 billion euros) in 2006, 36 percent higher than in 2005,
according to Forbes' annual ranking.


Russia's gross domestic product grew by 6.7 percent in 2006.


Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, a fixture in
British tabloids, again took the top spot in the ranking with a
fortune of 19.2 billion dollars.


Natural resources barons filled the other top spots: aluminium
magnate Oleg Deripaska took second place with 16.8 billion
dollars, while steel magnate Vladimir Lisin came in third with
15.1 billion.


The state's tightening grip on the oil and gas sectors made
itself felt, as only 18 of the 100 richest were in those sectors,
down from 41 in 2005.


Russia's billionaires also continue to be among the world's
youngest: the average age on the list was 45, compared to 62 in
the magazine's global ranking.
