Nokia, the world's leading maker of mobile phones, said on
Thursday its net profit slipped by seven percent in the first
quarter due to restructuring costs, but sales rose by four
percent.


Net profit dipped to 979 million euros (1.33 billion dollars)
from 1.0 billion euros a year earlier, Nokia said in a statement.


Overall sales rose from 9.5 to 9.8 billion euros during the
period, but the value of mobile phone sales shrank by five
percent to 5.5 billion euros as the company sold an increasing
share of low-end phones on developing markets such as China and
India.


The Finnish company said its share of the global mobile phone
market had risen from 35 to 36 percent during the quarter.


Nokia sold 91.1 million phones during the quarter, a rise of 21
percent from a year earlier, out of a total of 253 million phones
sold worldwide from January to March.


The price of the Nokia share rose by 3.76 percent at 18.22 euros
on the Helsinki stock exchange a half-hour after the earnings
report was presented.
