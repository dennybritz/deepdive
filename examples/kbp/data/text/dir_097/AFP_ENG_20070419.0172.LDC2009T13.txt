Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao called for steps to prevent fast
growth from leading to an overheated economy, the government said
Thursday, as first quarter economic growth increased to 11.1
percent.


"We must ... prevent the economy from changing from rather fast
paced to overheated, while also avoiding large ups and downs,"
the government quoted Wen as telling a Wednesday cabinet meeting.


We must "make efforts to realise the good and fast development of
the national economy."
