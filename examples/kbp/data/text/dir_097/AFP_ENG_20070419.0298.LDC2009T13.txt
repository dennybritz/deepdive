Chad's foreign minister said during an official visit to China
Thursday that talks to secure a Chinese presence in the African
country's oil industry were "progressing well."


"We are in talks, our oil minister will soon come to China, the
talks are progressing well," said Ahmat Allami in an interview
with AFP.


"The Chinese are open, they are win-win partners. As they say, it
is not about monopolies, these are much more equal partnerships
than those we are used to having," he said, after attending the
reopening of the Chadian embassy in Beijing.


Chad resumed diplomatic relations with Beijing in August, nearly
10 years after they were broken off.


China's burgeoning economic presence in several African nations
has sparked criticism that it is trying to plunder the
continent's vast natural resources and oil to feed its economic
boom.


The two countries have been discussing the 11 Chadian oil wells
acquired in January by China's biggest oil company, China
National Petroleum Corp.


The minister said tests were being conducted to check the
reserves in the wells.


"We plan to sign a production sharing agreement and we hope to
keep 40 percent of production, which is not the case in our
relations with Esso, Petronas and Shell," he added.


Allami also praised Beijing for its efforts in resolving the
Darfur crisis in Sudan, which borders Chad and has sparked
political tensions there.
