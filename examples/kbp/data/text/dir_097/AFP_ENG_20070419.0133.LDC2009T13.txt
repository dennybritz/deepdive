Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Thursday that any
attempts to unilaterally recognise the independence of Kosovo
could destabilise Serbia and the Balkan region.


"We are very much interested in the stability of the Balkans and
Serbia and that stability could be violated by any attempt to
unilaterally recognise the independence of Kosovo," Lavrov told
reporters in Belgrade after meeting with Serbian President Boris
Tadic.


"Any solution related to the problem of Kosovo must be acceptable
for Belgrade and Pristina. Any attempt at a unilateral solution
that would be imposed is absolutely unacceptable," said Lavrov.


Lavrov stressed Russia believed it was necessary "to pursue"
further negotiations on the future status of the disputed
province in order to try to reach a compromise between Serbian
and Kosovo Albanian authorities.


Kosovo has been administered by a United Nations mission since a
1999 NATO bombing campaign drove out Serb forces over a brutal
crackdown on the province's independence-seeking ethnic Albanian
majority.


Lavrov's visit to Belgrade comes ahead of a UN Security Council
debate expected next month on UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's
recommendation to grant Kosovo internationally supervised
independence.
