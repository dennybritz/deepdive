The trial of a human rights activist and translator for New York-
based Human Rights Watch was postponed here on Thursday, ahead of
an EU decision on whether to drop sanctions against the country.


Umida Niyazova, 32, was arrested in January as she entered the
country from Kyrgyzstan and was charged with illegally crossing
the border, smuggling and distributing publications threatening
the public order.


Human Rights Watch calls the charges politically motivated and
says that Niyazova faces 10 years in jail.


The postponement comes as Uzbekistan is trying to persuade
Brussels to lift sanctions related to the bloody government
crackdown on demonstrators in Andijan in 2005.


The EU imposed sanctions when Uzbekistan failed to launch an
independent probe into the massacre, though it is due next month
to consider dropping them.


No new trial date was given to activists, journalists and Western
diplomats who arrived at Sergeli district court for the hearing
on Thursday.


Uzbek authorities say that 187 people were killed in Andijan, all
due to the actions of Islamic insurgents, while rights groups say
that security forces killed hundreds of mainly unarmed
protesters.


At least 15 human rights activists are currently in jail in
Uzbekistan on politically motivated charges, Human Rights Watch
says.
