Indonesia's foreign minister said Thursday he was powerless to
prevent an Israeli delegation from attending an international
conference in Bali.


The Inter-Parliamentary Union has invited the delegation to its
upcoming conference on the Indonesian resort island, sparking
anger this week among some hardline Indonesian lawmakers.


But Hassan Wirajuda said the conference involved the IPU and the
Indonesian parliament rather than the government, which was
therefore not in a position to refuse the delegation.


"Indonesia as a host country of an IPU meeting cannot refuse (any
visit from any country) whether or not it has diplomatic
relations," Wirajuda told journalists, adding it was unclear if
Israel had accepted the offer to attend.


Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has no
diplomatic ties with Israel and often sees mass street protests
condemning Israel's moves in the Middle East.


Israel did not attend an IPU meeting in Indonesia in 2000 after
an outcry from some hardliners.


The conference run by the IPU, which seeks to promote democracy
and has 143 national parliaments as members, runs from April 29
to May 4.
