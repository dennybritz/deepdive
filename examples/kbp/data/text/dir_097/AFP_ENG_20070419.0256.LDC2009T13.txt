Authorities in the Maldives have asked Sri Lanka to help conduct
an independent autopsy on a man the opposition says was murdered
in custody, officials said Thursday.


The body of Hussein Salah was found floating in a lagoon near the
capital Male on Sunday, and attempts to bury him without an
autopsy led to angry protests.


Police said the man was found dead and that he had several drug-
related charges against him.


"Following requests from the bereaved family, the Maldivian
government has asked Sri Lanka to help with the autopsy," a Sri
Lankan official said. "The Maldivian request is under active
consideration."


The head of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), Mohamed
Nasheed, has also arrived in Sri Lanka following his release from
detention, officials said. MDP sources said he had suffered a
broken rib while in police custody.


Nasheed has been leading a campaign to oust Maldivian President
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom who is currently the longest serving
president in Asia, elected in 1978. He was arrested during
protests on Sunday outside the cemetery in Male.


Political parties were allowed in the Maldives for the first time
in June 2005 in line with reforms announced by Gayoom.


The Maldives, home to around 300,000 Sunni Muslims, is yet to
hold multi-party elections and Gayoom's opponents have accused
him of clinging to power in one of Asia's most exotic tourist
destinations.
