Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov will on Monday
begin a two-day visit to Russia, his country's main energy
partner, officials said.


The two sides will discuss "bilateral questions and regional
problems," the ITAR-TASS news agency quoted an unidentified
Russian diplomat as saying.


A Turkmen government official in Ashgabat confirmed to AFP that
the visit would take place.


It will be the Turkmen leader's second foreign trip since being
elected after the death of longtime Turkmen president Saparmurat
Niyazov in December.


Foreign powers are vying for access to Turkmenistan's vast
natural gas supplies, with Russia keen to keep its near-total
control of Turkmenistan's export pipelines.


Moscow needs Turkmen gas in order to meet its own export
commitments, having under-invested in exploiting its own
reserves, experts say.


Berdymukhammedov held talks in Saudi Arabia and visited the
Muslim holy city of Mecca earlier this month.
