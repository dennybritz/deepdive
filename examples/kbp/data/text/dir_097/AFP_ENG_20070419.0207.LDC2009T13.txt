A US citizen wanted in Los Angeles for suspected paedophilia was
arrested at the US embassy in the Indonesian capital while trying
to extend his visa, a report said Thursday.


University lecturer Ralph Belrin Stepp, 60, had been living in
West Jakarta since May 2002, Detikcom news portal reported.


Stepp was arrested on Monday when embassy staff pulled up his
file which showed his name was on a Los Angeles Police Department
wanted list for questioning on a paedophilia case, it said.


"There was no need for contact or coordination between the LAPD
and Indonesian police," said Justice and Rights ministry
spokesman Cecep Soepriatna.


Stepp will be deported late Thursday to the United States, he
said, adding: "He lectured at a university while staying here."
