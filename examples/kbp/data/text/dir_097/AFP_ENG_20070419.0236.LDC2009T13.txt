Sharks were the wedding witnesses Thursday as a Japanese couple
tied the knot surrounded by water and fish, in a unique ceremony
at an aquarium.


The bride, Nami Arakawa, 28, and groom Kosuke Sugiura, 29, chose
to tie the knot inside a 20-metre (66-foot) transparent tunnel
running through the aquarium.


Guests watched as sharks and rays swam around the couple as they
walked down the tunnel as if it were a wedding aisle.


"The bride and groom said they liked this place because very
young children were among the guests," said Akiko Tanaka,
spokeswoman for Tokyo's Shinagawa Prince Hotel which runs the
Aqua Stadium aquarium.


"Guests seemed to have had great fun, taking photos of the bride
and groom and then also of themselves in the tunnel and other
parts of the aquarium," she said.


The couple were the first to have a wedding at the venue but
another couple has made reservations in June, Tanaka said.
