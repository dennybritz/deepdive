German pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant Bayer said late on
Wednesday that it had received approval to market its Zetia anti-
cholesterol drug, developed jointly with Schering-Plough, in
Japan.


Bayer said in a statement that the Japanese Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare had approved Zetia for launch in Japan.


The drug would be co-marketed by Bayer Yakuhin and Schering-
Plough's Japanese arm, the statement said.


The total number of patients in Japan suffering from high
cholesterol is estimated to be around 30 million.
