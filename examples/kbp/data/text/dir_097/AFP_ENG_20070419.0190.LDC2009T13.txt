Riot police broke up scuffles Thursday as a key by-election
campaign began in Malaysia that could bolster former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim's return to formal politics.


The jostling broke out after hundreds of supporters from the
ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition and the opposition
People's Justice Party, formally run by Anwar's wife, crossed
paths in the seat of Ijok's western Selangor state during the
nomination of candidates.


Television images showed supporters tossing water bottles at each
other, while the state Bernama news agency said police broke up
the fracas.


The state by-election was called in the constituency of 12,372
voters after a state lawmaker died earlier this month.


The April 28 election is expected to be hard fought.
