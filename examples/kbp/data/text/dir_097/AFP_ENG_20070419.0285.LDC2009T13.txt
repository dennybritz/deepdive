Wales is considering a bid to host the 2016 European football
championships jointly with Scotland, the secretary general of the
Football Association of Wales, David Collins, revealed on
Thursday.


The success of Poland and Ukraine's joint bid for Euro 2012 has
encouraged Collins to believe that a Welsh-Scottish proposal
would have a good chance of success, despite the failure of a
joint Scottish and Irish bid for the 2008 tournament.


"At this moment in time we're floating the idea with Scotland,"
Collins said.


"We will start talking with the Scottish FA to see if they feel
they could join with us and hopefully in the next few months we
will have a clearer idea. Then we could get the Scottish
parliament and the Welsh assembly government to see if we could
move forward to put a bid together."


France are also considering a bid for the 2016 tournament.
