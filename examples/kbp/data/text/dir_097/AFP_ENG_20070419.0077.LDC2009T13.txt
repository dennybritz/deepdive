Australian share prices closed down 1.15 percent Thursday as
investors locked in profits after a record-breaking run and
responded to a downturn on Asian markets, dealers said.


The key SP/ASX 200 lost 71.8 points at 6,165.1 after Wednesday's
record close of 6,236.9, while the broader All Ordinaries index
fell 66.7 points at 6,148.3.
