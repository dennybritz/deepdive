A prominent Muslim cleric in Indian Kashmir has gone on a hunger
strike to force authorities to close down the only liquor shop in
the south of the state, officials said Thursday.


Qazi Ahmed Yasir, the head cleric in the southern Kashmir
district of Anantnag, has vowed not to eat until authorities shut
the recently opened shop in neighbouring Khanabal area.


"He has been joined by some half-a-dozen aides," a police officer
said.


Muslim militants closed down liquor shops, beauty parlours and
cinemas in Kashmir in 1990, a year after launching a deadly
insurgency against Indian rule in the scenic Himalayan region.


Only one liquor shop is operational in the state summer capital
Srinagar, but in a high security zone.


Yasir, also a key separatist in south of the state, said the
opening of the shop a few months back had increased crime in the
district.


"Some youth have started consuming alcohol, which is forbidden in
Islam," he told reporters.
