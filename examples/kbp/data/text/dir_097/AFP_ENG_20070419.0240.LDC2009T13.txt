MySpace launched a news service on Thursday that lets members of
the popular social-networking website decide which stories
bouncing about the Internet are most deserving of attention.


The MySpace News service scouts the Internet for news ranging
from gossip in online journals known as blogs to stories from
media conglomerates such as News Corporation, the Rupert Murdoch
headed company that owns MySpace.


Placement of items on MySpace News web pages will be dictated by
feedback from members, who get to rank stories on a scaled of
"loved it to hated it," according to the firm.


"MySpace News is designed to let users decide what's most
relevant to them," said MySpace president Tom Anderson.


"We're putting it to the community to be the editorial engine
driving our news service."


MySpace News uses a search algorithm to scan websites and blogs
as well as online newspapers and magazines. Items are organized
into categories such as politics, sports, technology and style.
