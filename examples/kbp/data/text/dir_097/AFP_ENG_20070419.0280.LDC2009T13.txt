China's new ambassador to Kathmandu presented his credentials to
Nepal's prime minister Thursday in a ceremony held for the first
time without the country's embattled King Gyanendra.


Ambassador Zhen Xianglin was given a red carpet welcome and a
salute from Nepalese soldiers when he arrived at the parliament
complex to hand over his official appointment letter to Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.


Prior to Thursday's ceremony, all foreign ambassadors had
presented their credentials to the king in his palace, but the
monarch has been stripped of most of his powers after Koirala
struck a peace deal with Maoist rebels last year.


An interim constitution has also seen Koirala assume the role of
head of state, leaving the king with little more than his title
and the fiercely republican Maoists also assuming cabinet
positions.


King Gyanendra's long-term future is also uncertain, with the
impoverished country set to go to the polls this year to choose a
body that will rewrite the constitution and decide on whether to
retain the monarchy.


The much-criticised monarch was forced to end a 14-month period
of dictatorial direct rule last April, after sidelined political
parties and former Maoist rebels joined forces to hold massive
demonstrations across the country.
