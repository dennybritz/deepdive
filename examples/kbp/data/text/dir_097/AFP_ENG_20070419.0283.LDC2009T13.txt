The gravestones of 52 French Muslim soldiers have been daubed
with Nazi slogans in a military cemetery in northeastern France,
officials said Thursday.


Swastikas and slogans such as "Heil Hitler" were also painted
Wednesday night on the ossuary of the Notre Dame de Lorette
cemetery, the biggest military graveyard in the country, said the
local prosecutor.


A hundred gendarmes were scouring the site Thursday for clues
about the perpetrators.


The cemetery, near the town of Arras, contains the graves of many
thousands of soldiers who died in World War I.


A man is currently being held in the northern city of Lille in
connection with an attack on a Jewish cemetery earlier this month
in which 51 tombstones were knocked over.
