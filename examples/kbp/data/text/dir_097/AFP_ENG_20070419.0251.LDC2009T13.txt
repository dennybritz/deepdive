A bomb threat targetting a Norwegian bus on Thursday prompted
authorities to close part of a major highway in southern Norway,
wreaking havoc for motorists, Norwegian police said.


The E18 motorway linking the capital Oslo with the southwestern
town of Stavanger was closed in both directions near Songe around
9:00 am (0700 GMT) after an anonymous caller said there was a
bomb on board a bus carrying about 50 people, of whom 30 were
high school students.


Passengers were evacuated from the bus and a bomb squad was sent
to the scene by helicopter to inspect the vehicle.


Traffic was rerouted, but major traffic jams were reported.
