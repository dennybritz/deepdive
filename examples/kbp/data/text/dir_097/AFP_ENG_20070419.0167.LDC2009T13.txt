Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon on Thursday urged
Singapore to ratify two United Nations conventions on rights.


He told AFP he raised the matter during a meeting with the city-
state's Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar.


McKinnon, who is on a regional tour, said about 15 other
Commonwealth members have also yet to ratify the Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights.


"I'm pursuing this Commonwealth-wide," he said. "It's been a
mission of mine for a couple of years."


Jayakumar told him that Singapore is looking at the issue. "That
was useful to hear," McKinnon said.


Most of those who have not signed the covenants are small states,
he added.


McKinnon was to hold talks later Thursday with Singapore's
founding father Lee Kuan Yew, and foreign minister George Yeo.


His tour takes him to Malaysia and Brunei later this month.


Established in 1926 and reformed in 1949, the Commonwealth of
Nations is a successor to the British Empire and brings together
53 diverse nations -- around a third of the world's countries and
a quarter of its population.
