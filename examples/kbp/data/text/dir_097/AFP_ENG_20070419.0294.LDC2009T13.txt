An Indonesian man convicted of killing a family of six in 1999
will be executed by firing squad on Borneo island before the end
of the month, a report said Thursday.


Prosecutor Asri Agung said a date had been set for the execution
of 40-year-old Ayub Bulubili, the state Antara news agency
reported.


"What is certain is that it will not be later than (the end of)
April because the preparations have been completed," Agung said
of the execution to be held in Central Kalimantan's Kapuas
district.


He declined to give further details.


Executions in Indonesia are by firing squad, usually carried out
at night and in isolated locations. The prisoner is notified of
his execution date at least 72 hours beforehand.


Bulubili was found guilty of slaughtering a family including four
children in Kapuas district in February 1999.


An appeal court and the Supreme Court have both upheld his death
sentence.


Indonesia last carried out an execution in September, of three
Christian militant leaders convicted of manslaughter during
sectarian violence in restive Central Sulawesi in 2000-2001.


Their executions sparked international criticism and fuelled
further unrest between Christians and Muslims in the area.
