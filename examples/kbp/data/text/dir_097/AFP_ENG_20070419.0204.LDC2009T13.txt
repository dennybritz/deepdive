Croatia's Olympic ski champion, 25-year-old Janica Kostelic,
announced on Thursday that she was retiring from competitive
skiing, due to long-standing health problems.


"I think that the moment has come for me to end my career. The
major reasons for that are my injuries," the four-time Olympic
champion told journalists.


Kostelic already took a one-year break last season due to
problems with her knees and back.
