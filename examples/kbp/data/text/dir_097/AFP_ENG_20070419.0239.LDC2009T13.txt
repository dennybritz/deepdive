Up to 100 men in the Philippines may have contracted rabies after
taking part in a self-flagellation ritual to celebrate Easter,
doctors and local authorities said Thursday.


A health alert was issued after a man who took part in the
bizarre ceremony -- where participants slash their backs with
knifes before flaying themselves with bamboo whips -- died from
the virus on April 11.


Mabalacat town mayor Mario Morales told local media that Eduardo
Sese, who was bitten by an infected dog in February, may have
contaminated up to 100 people who shared knives to cut
themselves.


The government doctor in Pampanga province north of Manila, Maria
Clara Aquino, said vaccines had been given to 103 people who
could have been exposed.


Self-flagellation is an annual tradition in Pampanga and other
parts of the Philippines where men whip themselves into a frenzy
on Good Friday to atone for their sins.


Rabies is a viral disease which infects domestic and wild
animals.


It is transmitted to other animals and humans through close
contact with saliva from infected animals such as bites,
scratches or licks on broken skin.


Once symptoms of the disease develop, rabies is fatal to both
animals and humans, according to the World Health Organisation.
Death can occur within seven days of infection.


A WHO study in 2004 estimated up to 55,000 people, mostly in
rural areas of Africa and Asia, die each year from rabies.
