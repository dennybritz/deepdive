China could face the risk of overheating if fast economic growth
continues, a ranking government official said Thursday.


"If the fast growth continues for a certain period, there is a
risk of shifting from fast growth to overheating," said Li
Xiaochao, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics.


Li made the remark at a briefing in Beijing shortly after
announcing 11.1 percent growth in the Chinese economy in the
first quarter, far above an 8.0 percent full-year target set by
the government and showing a sharp acceleration from 10.4 percent
in the last three months of 2006.
