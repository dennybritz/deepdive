China could face the risk of overheating if fast economic growth
continues, a ranking government official said Thursday.


"If the fast growth continues for a certain period, there is a
risk of shifting from fast growth to overheating," said Li
Xiaochao, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics.


Li made the remark at a briefing in Beijing shortly after
announcing 11.1 percent growth in the Chinese economy in the
first quarter.


The figure is far above an 8.0 percent full-year target set by
the government and indicates a sharp acceleration from 10.4
percent in the last three months of 2006.


The growth spurt has come about despite a whole series of cooling
measures adopted by the government since early last year,
including interest rate hikes and a reduction of tax incentives
for exporters.


China also said the consumer price index rose 2.7 percent in the
first quarter of 2007 from a year earlier, and was up 3.3 percent
in March alone, the government said Thursday.


The government is targetting an inflation rate within three
percent this year.


Consumer inflation is one of the key measures that the central
bank monitors when deciding what monetary measures to adopt.


Industrial output expanded 18.3 percent in the first quarter of
2007 compared with a year earlier, while fixed-asset investment
rose 23.7 percent,  the government said.


Industrial output is a key measure of activity in the world's
fourth-largest economy while fixed asset investment is the main
indicator of state-funded spending on new productive capacity.
