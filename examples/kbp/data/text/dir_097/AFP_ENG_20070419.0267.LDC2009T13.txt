The Russian economy grew by 7.9 percent in the first quarter of
2007 on a 12-month comparison, Russian Economic Development
Minister German Gref said on Thursday.


"The essential characteristic of the first quarter is the new
wave of quickening of economic growth," Gref was quoted by
Russian news agencies as telling a government meeting.


"According to preliminary estimates the first-quarter gross
domestic product grew by 7.9 percent compared to the first
quarter of the previous year," he said.


In 2006, first-quarter growth was five percent.


Gref said the first-quarter performance meant that the government
could increase its annual growth forecast from 6.2 percent to 6.5
percent, after registering growth of 6.7 percent last year.


Gref also said that exports had grown by 5.3 percent, and that
for the first time the figure was lower than the growth of gross
domestic product.


This was a signal, he said, that Russia's economy should be
"reviewed from top to bottom".


Imports had grown by 35.8 percent in the first quarter, he said,
four and a half times more than GDP, in a sign that Russia is
lagging its competitors.
