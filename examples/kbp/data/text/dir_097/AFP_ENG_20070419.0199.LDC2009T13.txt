Pakistan has appointed all-rounder Shoaib Malik as captain of the
national cricket team, the country's cricket chief said Thursday.


"He is a unanimous choice. He is the best man to lead the team,"
Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf told a news
conference in the eastern city of Lahore, flanked by Malik.


Malik will be the captain of both the Test and the one-day side
until at least the end of 2007, he added.
