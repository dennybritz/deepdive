China's industrial output expanded 18.3 percent in the first
quarter of 2007 compared with a year earlier, the government said
Thursday.


Industrial output, a key measure of activity in the world's
fourth-largest economy, has been boosted by massive investment in
new plant and equipment in recent years, alongside booming
exports.
