US Defence Secretary Robert Gates visited US commanders in the
former Sunni Arab insurgent bastion of Fallujah on Thursday
straight after arriving in Iraq on an unannounced trip.


Gates flew by helicopter to the city west of the capital
immediately after flying in to Baghdad airport.


His visit came a day after car bombings ripped through a US-
backed security plan for the Iraqi capital, killing 190 people.


Gates was on the latest leg of a Middle East tour that has
already taken him to Western allies Jordan and Egypt as well as
Israel.
