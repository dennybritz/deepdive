Gaming revenues in Macau has shot up 45  percent year-on-year to
a record of 17.88 billion patacas (2.30 billion US) in the first
quarter of this year, official figures showed.


The figures further solidify the tiny former Portugese enclave's
position as the world's largest gaming centre.


In 2006, gross gaming revenues at Macau's 22 casinos were
equivalent to 7.2 billion dollars, outstripping the 6.6 billion
dollars pulled in by the 40-odd gaming centres along Las Vegas'
famous boulevard.


Analysts said the boost was spurred by new mega-casino openings,
including the Wynn Macau, owned by American gaming mogul Steve
Wynn, and the Hong Kong-owned Galaxy StarWorld.


It was also buoyed by Chinese visitors who made up 60 percent of
a record 22 million visitors who entered the city of 500,000 last
year, a figure that tourism chiefs expect will exceed 25 million
this year.


Macau's casino sector has rocketed since a law passed in 2001
stripped tycoon Stanley Ho of his 40-year monopoly on casino
operations in the former Portuguese enclave.


The move attracted American operators, such as Las Vegas giants
Sands, Wynn and MGM, whose new glitzy casino-hotel complexes
transformed the sector, ushering in an era of massive growth.
