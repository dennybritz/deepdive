A salvo of mortar rounds overnight killed a young Iraqi woman and
two men in a mainly Shiite district of southern Baghdad, a
medical source said on Thursday.


The shells smashed into the Zafaraniyah district, killing two men
and an 18 -year-old woman and wounding a six-year-old boy, the
medical official said.


Just hours earlier, multiple car bombings killed 190 people in
other Shiite districts across the capital, dealing a hefty blow
to the credibility of a two- month-old US plan to return security
to Baghdad.


The defence ministry announced on Thursday that Iraqi forces had
killed "20 terrorists and arrested 84 suspects" during various
operations in the capital and to the north of the city in the
past 24 hours.


In the central Shiite city of Kut, one police officer was shot
dead in an insurgent ambush near his home, said local police
spokesman Nahim Hassan.


Daily attacks on Shiite-populated areas and on the Shiite-
dominated Iraqi government security forces are trademark tactics
blamed on Sunni militants.
