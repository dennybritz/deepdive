US Defence Secretary Robert Gates on Thursday left Israel after
holding talks with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on the third leg of
a Middle East tour.


Gates met Olmert earlier in Jerusalem, saying that Washington
favoured diplomacy to deal with the nuclear programme of Iran,
the Jewish state's arch-foe.


The secretary arrived in Israel on Wednesday from Egypt as part
of a regional tour that has also taken him to Jordan and is aimed
at countering the influence of Iran and at shoring up support for
Iraq.
