US special forces and Afghan soldiers killed 24 Taliban militants
in a seven- hour battle and an airstrike in troubled southern
Afghanistan, the US-led coalition said Thursday.


Two coalition troops were also wounded during the overnight clash
in the Sangin district of Helmand province, which international
forces said they had seized back from insurgent control almost
two weeks ago.


Four rebel vehicles were destroyed in the battle, a coalition
statement said.


The statement said that US and Afghan forces received
intelligence about "enemy activity" involving an estimated 40
Taliban fighters following a brief earlier engagement in which
three rebels were arrested.


"After manoeuvring to gain contact with the enemy force, US
special forces requested coalition air support to engage the
Taliban fighters as they were attempting to establish ambush
positions," the statement said.


"Approximately 24 Taliban fighters were killed and four vehicles
destroyed during the prolonged seven-hour battle," it added.


The two coalition soldiers whose names and nationalities were not
revealed were treated in a nearby coalition medical facility
where they were in a stable condition, the statement said.
