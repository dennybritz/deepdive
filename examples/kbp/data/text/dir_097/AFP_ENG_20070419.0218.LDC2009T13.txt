Egypt on Thursday strongly condemned the wave of bombings that
claimed nearly 200 lives in Iraq, expressing bafflement over the
large-scale killing of civilians.


"It is impossible to understand the logic or the goal behind
killing innocent Iraqi civilians whom have no connection with
political developments," said Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit
in a statement.


Abul Gheit also expressed "strong regret that some forces present
in Iraq insist on destroying efforts to create reconciliation and
stability there."


The predominantly Sunni country also expressed support for the
Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki working to
promote reconciliation in the country and added that the Iraqi
leader would be in Egypt to discuss bilateral relations prior to
a reconciliation conference in early May.


Iraq's government has had rocky relations with fellow Arab
governments which have only grudgingly accepted the post US-led
invasion political system.


In a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other top
officials Wednesday, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates emphasised
the need to support Maliki's government.
