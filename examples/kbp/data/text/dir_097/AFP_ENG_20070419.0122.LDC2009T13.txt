China's consumer price index rose 2.7 percent in the first
quarter of 2007 from a year earlier, and was up 3.3 percent in
March alone, the government said Thursday.


The government is targetting an inflation rate within three
percent this year in the fast growing economy.


Consumer inflation is one of the key measures that the central
bank monitors when deciding what monetary measures to adopt.


"There is potential pressure for further growth in the consumer
price index," Li Xiaochao, spokesman of the National Bureau of
Statistics, told a briefing in Beijing.


China announced Thursday 11.1 percent growth in the first three
months of the year compared with the same period last year, the
fastest quarterly growth since the second quarter of last year.
