China's fixed asset investment rose 23.7 percent in the first
quarter of 2007 from the same period a year ago, the National
Bureau of Statistics said Thursday.


Fixed asset investment, the main indicator of state-funded
spending on new productive capacity, is seen as being fuelled by
the ample liquidity in the world's fourth-largest economy.


The government has undertaken several measures to tighten
liquidity in the past several years as it tries to keep the
economy on a more sustainable growth path.
