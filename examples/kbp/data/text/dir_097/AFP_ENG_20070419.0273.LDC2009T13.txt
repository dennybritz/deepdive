The longest investigation into the effects of salt on health
shows that individuals who sharply reduce salt in their diet also
slash the risks of a stroke or heart disease by up to a quarter.


The evidence comes from two trials that were conducted in the
1990s involving more than 3,000 adults aged 30-54, who were
diagnosed as "pre-hypertension," meaning they had the precursor
signs of developing high blood pressure.


The volunteers either reduced salt intake by 25-35 percent or
were assigned to a "control" group which did not cut back on
salt. Ten to 15 years later, they were questioned again about
their health.


Salt-cutters were 25 percent less likely to have developed
cardiovascular problems at the followup check than counterparts
in the control group, and they also showed a 20 percent lower
mortality rate.


Previous research has shown that salt reduction can lower blood
pressure, but this is the widest and longest study yet to say
that it also reduces some of the impacts of hypertension.


The research is published online Thursday by the British Medical
Journal (bmj.com). It was led by Nancy Cook of Brigham and
Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts.


Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Western
populations and rates are surging in fast-growing developing
countries. The mooted causes include a rise in obesity, sedentary
lifestyle and the switch to fatty and salt- laden diets.
