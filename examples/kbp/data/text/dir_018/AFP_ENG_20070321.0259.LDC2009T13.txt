Zambia's former president Kenneth Kaunda, an historic ally of
Zimbabwe's embattled leader Robert Mugabe, urged African leaders
Wednesday to appoint a committee of eminent people to mediate in
that country's worsening political crisis.


Kaunda told state-run radio the issue needed to be resolved
urgently but defended Mugabe by saying British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, a harsh critic of the Harare regime, mishandled
issues in the southern African nation.


"There is a need for African leaders to appoint a committee of
eminent persons which should find a lasting solution in
Zimbabwe," Kaunda said.


He accused western nations of supporting the opposition Movement
for Democratic Change's (MDC) activities in Zimbabwe.


The issue of Zimbabwe is heating up in Zambia with President Levy
Mwanawasa taking a tough stance against Harare while another ex-
president, Frederick Chiluba, has defended Mugabe.


Zambia's main opposition leader Michael Sata recently lambasted
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai as a puppet of the West, financed to
cause trouble in Zimbabwe.


The Zimbabwean government has launched a violent crackdown on
opposition leaders, which has seen many arrested and assaulted in
recent days as international condemnation of the 83-year-old
Mugage's regime mounts.


Mugabe has been in power since Zimbabwe's independence from
Britain in 1980, and has announced his intention to stand again
in elections scheduled for next year.


Inflation in the one-time bread basket of Southern Africa is
running at 1,730 percent and there are widespread food shortages.
