The leading German distribution and retail group Metro reported
on Wednesday that takeovers helped it to nearly double net profit
last year.


The result, 1.05 billion euros (1.4 billion dollars) after 531
million euros in 2005, far exceeded the figure forecast by
analysts who had expected 895 million euros.


Earnings before interest and tax rose by 14 percent to 1.98
billion euros.


The group said that this year it expected sales to rise by eight
to nine pecent, and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT)
and excluding exceptional items by six to eight percent.


The group published sales data in January showing an increase of
7.5 percent to 59.9 billion euros, boosted by the acquisition of
activities owned by US group Wal-Mart in Germany and of the
Polish activities of French group Geant.


Metro recommended a dividend of 1.12 euros from 1.02 euros last
year.
