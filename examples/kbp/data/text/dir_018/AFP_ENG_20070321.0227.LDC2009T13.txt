Sri Lanka's air force is considering buying MiG-29 jet fighters
to replace its ageing fleet of supersonic aircraft, the top air
force officer said Wednesday.


Commander Roshan Goonetileke said Sri Lanka was looking at the
1977 Soviet vintage MiG-29 combat aircraft, refurbished in the
Ukraine, to replace Sri Lanka's fleet of MiG-27 planes, as well
as the Israeli-built Kfir and Chinese F-7 planes.


"We're looking at the MiG-29 because we're already flying the
MiG-27," Goonetileke said, adding a transition from the 1972
vintage MiG-27 to the 1977 MiG-29 would be easier.


Sri Lanka's air force has bought 10 MiG-27 planes and one MiG-23
trainer aircraft since 2000, when Tamil Tiger guerrillas
escalated attacks against government forces.


The air force currently operates four MiG-27 planes, while three
have been grounded for major overhauls.


Tamil Tiger rebels destroyed more than a dozen military aircraft
parked at a base adjoining the international airport in July
2001. Among the planes destroyed was a MiG-27 swing-wing
aircraft.


In August 2001, a MiG-27 crashed near the international airport
while a Ukrainian pilot attempted aerobatics. A third crashed
into a lagoon near the airport in June 2004.


Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels are known to possess an air field
in the north of the island and operate small fixed-wing planes,
but the Sri Lankan air force has not faced the rebel aircraft in
combat.


More than 60,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's Tamil
separatist campaign since 1972.
