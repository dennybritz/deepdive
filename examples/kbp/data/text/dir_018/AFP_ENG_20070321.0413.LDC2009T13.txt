Apple began shipping on Wednesday its much-ballyhooed Apple TV
set-top device that wirelessly connects televisions to home
computers.


Apple TVs could be ordered at the Cupertino, California,
company's online store and will be available by week's end at its
real-world stores where employees will provide workshops on how
to use the devices, Apple said.


Apple TVs are priced at 299 dollars (US) and have 40 gigabyte
hard drives capable of storing as much as 50 hours of video or
25,000 photos, according to Apple.


Apple TVs are capable of automatically synchronizing music, video
or other digitized content streamed wirelessly from as many as
five computers.


"Apple TV is like a DVD player for the Internet age, providing an
easy and fun way to play all your favorite iTunes content from
your PC or Mac on your widescreen TV," said Apple senior vice
president Philip Schiller.


"Apple TV allows you to wirelessly play your content from your
PCs or Macs using your existing WiFi network as well as the
newest and fastest version."


Apple, maker of Macintosh computers and iPod MP3 players, had
delayed the release of Apple TV for undisclosed reasons.
