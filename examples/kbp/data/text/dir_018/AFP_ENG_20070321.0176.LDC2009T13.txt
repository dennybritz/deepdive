Sigmund Freud's neurotic attitude to travel is laid bare in a
series of letters penned by the father of psychoanalysis which go
on show in London from Thursday.


"Midday, opposite the Pantheon," he wrote in a missive to his
wife from Rome, published in the Guardian newspaper.


"This is what I have been afraid of for years."


Freud was reportedly terrified that he would be overcome by the
weight of culture and history in the city, although other
destinations apparently proved more soothing.


The Austrian was a big fan of Blackpool, a seaside resort in the
northwest of England, and told of his exploits beachcombing and
rock pool hunting in an 1875 letter.


"One feels oneself like a hero who has performed deeds of
improbable greatness," he wrote.


On a return visit to nearby Lytham St Anne's in 1908, he added:
"I enjoy it much better here than anywhere else... England in
general is for holidays and eating: there is more pleasure in
human contact here than elsewhere."


Freud later mentioned his love of Blackpool in the landmark 1900
work "The Interpretation of Dreams".


Another letter written to his wife during a trip to New York
details a visit to a new skyscraper but adds that he was not
impressed because he has seen more beautiful landmarks, "though
of course nothing bigger or wider".


The exhibition -- entitled "Reisemalheurs", or the woes of travel
-- goes on show at the Freud Museum, in Hampstead, northwest
London, until April 22.
