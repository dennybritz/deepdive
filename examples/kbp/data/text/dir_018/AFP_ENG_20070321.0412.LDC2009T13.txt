The number of attacks on Jews in Canada increased 12.8 percent in
2006, echoing a rise in anti-Semitism worldwide, a leading Jewish
advocacy group reported Wednesday.


"The increase is startling," said Anita Bromberg, legal counsel
for B'nai Brith Canada, indicating the number of incidents had
doubled since 2002.


A total 935 cases were reported last year, including harassment
(588), vandalism (317) and violence (30), mostly in Montreal
which is home to Canada's largest Jewish community.


A rabbi was assaulted, a school was evacuated over a bomb scare,
the words "dirty Jews" and swastikas were painted on synagogues,
and delegates at a federal Liberal leadership convention were
urged not to support a candidate because his wife was Jewish.


"Hate is a ticking time bomb in Canada ... and the fuse is
getting shorter," said Frank Dimant, B'nai Brith executive vice
president. "Today, the situation is more frightening than ever in
this country."


He blamed "cracks in multiculturalism," or growing intolerance of
Canada's varied cultural traditions, as well as the import of
hate from abroad, noting incidents spiked in July and August 2006
during the Israel-Lebanon conflict.
