Germany has finished writing a declaration to mark the 50th
anniversary of the EU and has sent the text to fellow leaders of
the bloc to approve, the chief government spokesman said on
Wednesday.


"We are confident that by the weekend we will have a text that
has been approved by all 27 members of the union," said spokesman
Ulrich Wilhelm who declined to reveal the content of the "Berlin
Declaration."


"We trust that we will have a good text," he added.


The text has been penned behind closed doors by Germany, the
current president of the EU, with input from other EU
governments.


The declaration marks the 50th anniversary of the signature of
the Treaty of Rome which established the European Economic
Community, the fore-runner of the EU.


It is meant to give fresh impetus to efforts to revive the EU's
constitution project. Its content has been hotly debated, notably
over whether it would mention religion.


The declaration will be signed by Merkel, European Commission
Chief Jose Manuel Barroso and the head of the European
Parliament, Hans-Gert Poettering, in Berlin on Sunday.


Germany has promised to deliver a relatively short, accessible
declaration.
