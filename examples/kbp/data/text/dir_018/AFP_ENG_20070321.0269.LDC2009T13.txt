Three more people have been arrested after the latest in a spate
of fatal stabbings in London left a 15-year-old boy dead, police
said Wednesday.


Adam Regis, nephew of retired British Olympic sprinter John
Regis, was found by his grandmother with stab wounds late
Saturday in east London, near Premiership football club West
Ham's ground.


On Tuesday morning, officers from London's Metropolitan Police
arrested a 17 -year-old boy in connection with their inquiry. He
was released on bail Wednesday morning.


On Tuesday evening, they also arrested three men aged 19, 20 and
22 at an address in Beckton, east London.


"We stress that the investigation continues and that all our
points of appeal remain," a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.


"All lines of inquiry remain open".


Regis's death came amid growing concern among politicians that
there is a spiralling knife and gun culture among young people in
the British capital.


Last week, another young Briton, Kodjo Yenga, was killed in a
knife attack in Hammersmith, west London.


And last month, armed police went on patrol in some parts of
London after the four people, including three teenagers, were
shot within days.


Asked about the deaths during his weekly question-and-answer
session in the lower House of Commons, Prime Minister Tony Blair
said: "This is a very specific problem in specific cultures and
specific parts of our inner cities".


He pledged to unveil further proposals to deal with the issue in
the coming weeks.
