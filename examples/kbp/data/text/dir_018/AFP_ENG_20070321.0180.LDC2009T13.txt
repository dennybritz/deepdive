British troops began withdrawing from Bosnia on Wednesday after
15 years of helping to keep the peace in the war-torn Balkan
country.


"We have got about a 100 soldiers leaving today," British
Lieutenant Helen Munro told AFP, adding the first group were
mostly from the Welsh Guards, a prominent infantry regiment.


The pull-out of the entire British contingent of 600 troops in
Bosnia was announced last month as part of the European Union's
plans to cut its number of EUFOR peacekeepers in the country to
2,500 from 6,500.


EUFOR, which took over from a NATO peacekeeping mission in 2004,
is charged with carrying out military tasks set out in the Dayton
peace accords that ended the Bosnian war in 1995.


The majority of the British contingent has been based in Banja
Luka, the administrative centre of Bosnia's Serb entity,
Republika Srpska.


Bosnia's three-and-a-half year war pitted Serbs against Muslims
and Croats, claiming tens of thousands of lives and leaving
around half of its 4.4 million people homeless.
