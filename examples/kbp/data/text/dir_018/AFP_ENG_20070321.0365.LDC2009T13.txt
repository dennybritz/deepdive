At least 13 people have been killed and dozens injured in clashes
in southeast Nepal between Maoists and activists from an ethnic
minority group, officials said Wednesday.


"So far 11 men and two women have died in clashes between
supporters of the Mahadhesi Janadhikar Forum (Mahadhesi People's
Rights Forum) and the Maoist Mahadhesi wing," local police
Superintendent Ram Kumar Khanal told AFP.


He said the death toll could rise further.


Shots were fired by both groups during the clash, but most of the
victims were beaten to death with bamboo poles, the police
officer said.


Around 30 others were injured of whom 12 were in a critical
condition and have been sent to hospitals in neighbouring
district for treatment, he said.


"The clashes started after disputes between the two sides over
organising a programme at the same venue," said Khanal.


The violence occurred in Gaur, around 300 kilometres (186 miles)
southeast of Kathmandu, and a curfew has been imposed by local
authorities, home ministry spokesman Baman Prasad Neupane said.


Ethnic Mahadeshis from the lowland Terai region bordering India
have been protesting for greater representation in national
politics by holding a series of strikes, blockades and violent
demonstrations in their region.


The unrest has left close to 40 people dead since January.
