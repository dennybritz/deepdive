Real Madrid are ready to pay Manchester United a club record 80
million euros (105 million dollars) to land Portuguese winger
Cristiano Ronaldo, Spanish sports daily AS reported Wednesday.


Ronaldo's future at Old Trafford has been a constant subject for
speculation with Spanish media saying for months he will end up
at the Bernabeu.


If Real do stump up and convince the 22-year-old starlet his
future does lie in La Liga then the Spanish giants would smash
the 75 million former record of 75 million euros paid to Juventus
to land now retired French star Zinedine Zidane in 2001, AS said.


AS and rival sports daily Marca said last week that Ronaldo,
whose contract at Old Trafford runs to 2010, wanted to come to
Spain with Real or Barcelona his mooted destinations.


Contract talks over an extension at United have not yet reached a
breakthrough but on Sunday United coach Alex Ferguson voiced
confidence his star will stay with the English Premiership
leaders for years to come.


"I'm confident he will be a United player," Ferguson said
regarding a proposed two-year extension to Ronaldo's existing
deal.


The player has hit 16 goals this season but was involved in a
"diving" storm after winning the penalty which saw United see off
Middlesrbough to boo their passage to the FA Cup semi-final.
Ronaldo himself converted the spot-kick.
