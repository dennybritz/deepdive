British finance minister Gordon Brown, delivering his annual
budget, announced plans for the first tax cut on company profits
since 1999.


Brown, tipped to soon replace Tony Blair as prime minister, said
he would cut corporation tax to 28 percent from 30 percent in
April 2008.


Brown said the new rate, equivalent to 28 pence in the pound,
would be "the lowest of all the major economies."


Welcoming the news, Miles Templeman, director-general of the
Institute of Directors, said: "We are delighted that the main
corporation tax rate is being cut ... exactly in line with the
IoD's budget representations.''


But Nick Goulding, chairman for the Forum of Private Business,
said the tax cuts would benefit only big business as small
companies were being hit in other ways.


Carol Undy, chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses,
added: "This is the chancellor's 11th budget and this year's
offering is no different to the others -- he gives with one hand
and takes with the other."
