Dreadlocked Zimbabwe players have been ordered to cut off their
flowing locks, it was reported here on Wednesday.


The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU), keen to improve their poor
reputation, told at least three members of the squad - Tawanda
Mupariwa, Keith Dabengwa and Stuart Matsinkenyeri - to conform
with the ruling.


Zimbabwe team media manager Lovemore Banda told the Jamaica
Gleaner newspaper that the idea was to have all the players
looking uniform.


"The cricket committee of Zimbabwe Cricket decided that in terms
of uniformity, appearance and neatness, the players needed to
look to be the best representatives they could be for their
country and therefore they recommended those who wear locks cut
them," said Banda


Mupariwa, Dabengwa and Matsinkenyeri all agreed, he added.


"The point is that we wanted the players to cut their locks and
they consented," he added.


"There were some who were in the process of growing them. They
also wanted those players to look as presentable as possible."


Captain Prosper Utseya said the players weren't happy but gave in
to the board's demand.


"Obviously they didn't like it but cricket is a gentleman's game
so we have to be disciplined - especially for the youngsters
coming into the team," he said.


"In Zimbabwe (dreadlocks) are not a religion, it's a fashion
thing".
