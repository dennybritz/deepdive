West Ham striker Dean Ashton will be out of action for the rest
of the season after a further operation on an ankle he broke
while training with the England squad last year.


Ashton would have made his England debut against Greece in August
after receiving his first call-up to the squad but he had to pull
out after sustaining the injury.


Hammers head physiotherapist Steve Allen told West Ham's website,
www.whufc.com on Wednesday: "It will be six weeks before he is
back running, and we felt that the timing was right, in order for
Dean to make a fresh start with the rest of his team-mates when
the squad returns for pre-season training in the summer.


"We look forward to seeing him back to full fitness then."


The 23-year-old Ashton had an operation on Monday to remove an
area of scar tissue emanating from the broken left ankle.
