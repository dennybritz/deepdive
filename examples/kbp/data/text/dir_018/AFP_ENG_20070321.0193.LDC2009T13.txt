At least six people have been killed and dozens injured in
clashes in southeast Nepal between Maoists and activists from an
ethnic minority group, officials said Wednesday.


"At least six people have been killed and 32 injured in a
gunfight between Mahadhesi protesters and Maoists," home ministry
spokesman Baman Prasad Neaupane said.


The clash occurred in Gaur, around 300 kilometres (186 miles)
southeast of Kathmandu, and a curfew has been imposed by local
authorities, he added.


Ethnic Mahadeshis from the lowland Terai region bordering India
have been protesting for greater representation in national
politics by holding a series of strikes, blockades and violent
demonstrations in their region.


The unrest has left close to 40 people dead since January.
