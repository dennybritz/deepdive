British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain would urge the
European Union to impose tougher sanctions on Zimbabwe,
describing the situation there as "appalling, disgraceful and
utterly tragic".


"We will press the European Union to widen the political
sanctions that were introduced in 2002 and introduced very much
as a result of our prompting at the time," Blair told parliament
during his weekly question-and-answer session.


"That assets freeze and travel ban we will seek to extend as far
as we can."


Blair echoed Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett's view that, in
the light of growing concern at violence towards opposition
groups, action was needed from the United Nations Security
Council and the UN Human Rights Commission.


"We will be urging partners in both those institutions to come
out with strong statements against what is happening in Zimbabwe,
which is appalling, disgraceful and utterly tragic for the people
of Zimbabwe," he told lawmakers.


Belgium on Tuesday admitted that a visa was issued by mistake to
a close aide of President Robert Mugabe, despite him being on an
EU blacklist and banned from travelling in the bloc.


Mugabe himself and his entourage are banned from travelling to
Europe under EU sanctions on Zimbabwe since 2002 for human rights
violations.
