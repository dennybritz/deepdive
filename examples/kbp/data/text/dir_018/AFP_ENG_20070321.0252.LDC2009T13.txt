Middlesbrough defender Jonathan Woodgate, who has a knee problem,
is a slight doubt for England's Euro 2008 qualifier in Israel on
Saturday.


Though Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate told the club's
official website Woodgate should be fit for the Tel-Aviv, Group E
game, his injury will need to be monitored closely.


Woodgate made his long-awaited return to the international stage
in the friendly defeat against Spain at Old Trafford last month.
