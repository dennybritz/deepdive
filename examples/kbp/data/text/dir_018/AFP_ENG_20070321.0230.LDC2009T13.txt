The Italian rugby federation (FIR) have lodged an appeal against
the four-week ban given to Mauro Bergamasco, an FIR spokesman
told AFP on Wednesday.


The 27-year-old Stade Francais flanker was suspended by the Six
Nations disciplinary committee on March 13 for hitting Wales
captain Stephen Jones in the face with his forearm during Italy's
23-20 victory in Rome.


As a result of the ban, Bergamasco missed Italy's final Six
Nations match at home to Ireland last Saturday.


If Italy's appeal is successful, Bergamasco could be free to play
for Stade Francais in their European Cup quarter-final against
Leicester on April 1.


Stade have already lost prop Sylvain Marconnet, lock, David
Auradou and hooker Dimitri Szarzewski due to injuries.
