British finance minister Gordon Brown, delivering his annual
budget, said Wednesday he would cut corporation tax, or taxation
on company profits, to 28 percent from 30 percent in April 2008.


Brown said the new rate, equivalent to 28 pence in the pound,
would be "the lowest of all the major economies."
