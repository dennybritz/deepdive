A US Congress panel defied President George W. Bush Wednesday by
authorizing subpoenas of White House officials to quiz them in a
mushrooming controversy over the sackings of eight prosecutors.


The move came one day after Bush stridently said he would resist
subpoenas, saying White House staff members would only be
interviewed by small groups of legislators and not under oath.


Those officials include former White House counsel Harriet Miers
and longtime Bush aide and political strategist Karl Rove.


Democratic Representative Linda Sanchez, chairwoman of the House
subcommittee with jurisdiction for approving the subpoenas, said
her committee's action Wednesday "will assist our efforts to
secure testimony from White House and Department of Justice
officials who appear to have played central roles in the US
attorney terminations."


"It will also assist our efforts to obtain key documents from the
White House and the Justice Department -- including the complete
versions of documents we have thus far received only in redacted
form," Sanchez said.


Democrats have alleged that the firings of the prosecutors in
December were politically motivated.


"We are greatly concerned that this purge was intended to allow
prosecutors to be used as simply one more instrument of political
control instead of to administer justice equally to all," Sanchez
said.
