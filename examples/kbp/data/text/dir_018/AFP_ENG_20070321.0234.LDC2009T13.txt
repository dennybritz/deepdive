Danish cabin crews at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) walked
off the job for several hours early Wednesday after wage talks
with the airline broke down, causing major flight disruptions,
SAS said.


The airline cancelled 94 flights in and out of Copenhagen during
the morning before cabin crews returned to work, SAS spokesman
Mikkel Loendal told AFP.


Delays were however expected to continue throughout Wednesday.


"Cabin attendants resumed work at 10:30 this morning... We expect
traffic to return to normal by tomorrow morning," he said.


The wildcat strike was launched after the airline failed to reach
a collective wage agreement with the 1,600-member Cabin
Attendants Union.


Both sides are scheduled to meet with an arbitrator late
Thursday.
