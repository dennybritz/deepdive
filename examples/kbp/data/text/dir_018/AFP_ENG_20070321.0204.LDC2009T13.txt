J-League champions Urawa Red Diamonds fought back from two goals
down to claim a 2-2 draw with Sydney FC in their AFC Champions
League football match here Wednesday.


The Japanese giants, playing in only their second Asian Champions
League campaign, fell behind to a David Carney strike in the
second minute.


Sydney doubled their lead with a 23rd-minute penalty from
midfielder Ufuk Talay, in shades of Sydney's opening win against
Shanghai Shenhua.


But Urawa pulled one goal back through Robson Ponte in the 30th
minute before home goalkeeper Clint Bolton gifted striker Yuchiro
Nagai with the easiest of equalisers early in the second half.


Bolton, diving away from goal to claim a Ponte cross, mishandled
the ball as he fell to the ground to allow Nagai to poke home the
equaliser in the 54th minute.


Urawa and Sydney lead Group E with four rounds remaining.
