China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo put in a near-immaculate
performance to regain the pairs title at the world figure skating
championships on Wednesday.


Shen and Zhao, who stormed back from a fall to win the bronze
medal at the Turin Olympics last year, won a standing ovation for
their bewitching routine set to Jules Massenet's "Meditation from
Thais."


The Chinese pair took top spot in the short programme Tuesday and
marked the best score of 132.63 points in the free skating for a
total of 203.50 points.


It was the third world title for Shen and Zhao, who won in 2002
and 2003 and took silver at the 2004 championships.


Their compatriots and defending champions Pang Qing and Tong Jian
finished second with a total of 188.46 points, followed by Aliona
Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy of Germany with 187.39 points.


China failed to make it a clean sweep of medals as last year's
silver medallists, Zhang Dan and Zhang Hao, finished fifth with
173.39 points.


Russia's Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov, the 2000 champions
who have also taken silver and two bronzes, withdrew with
Tikhonov suffering from a right leg injury.
