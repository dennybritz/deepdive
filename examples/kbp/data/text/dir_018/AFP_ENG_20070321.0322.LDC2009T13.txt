Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned world
powers on Wednesday his country would do whatever it could to
defend itself from force or the threat of force against it.


Iran "will use all its capabilities to respond to threats and to
the use of force and violence," he said in a nationally televised
speech from the holy city of Mashhad.


"If they want to use threats, to resort to force and violence,
then without a doubt the people and the authorities will use all
their capabilities to strike the enemies," he added.
