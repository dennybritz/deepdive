The editor-in-chief of the Russian version of Forbes magazine,
Maxim Kashulinski, was ordered to pay construction group Inteko
109,165 roubles (3,150 euros) on Wednesday for libelling its
chairwoman.


A court said December's cover story on Elena Baturina, Russia's
richest woman and wife of Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov, damaged her
professional reputation, Interfax reported.


Inteko, which had accused Forbes of publishing "unreliable
information", welcomed the verdict but Kashulinski's lawyers said
they would appeal.


The Russian firm had previously disputed a quote used on the
front cover of the magazine where Baturina said: "I am guaranteed
protection." It was taken as a reference to her husband's
political power.


Publishers Axel Springer withdrew the edition and replaced it
with a cover where she said: "I am guaranteed protection, as an
investor."


Baturina's fortune, estimated by Forbes at around 2.4 billion
dollars (1.8 billion euros), has more than doubled since 2004.
Inteko is the biggest contractor dealing with major public works
projects in Moscow.


Forbes has been published in Russia since 2004. Its first editor-
in-chief Paul Klebnikov, who wrote investigative stories on
Russian businessmen and the conflict in Chechnya, was shot dead
in Moscow in July 2004.
