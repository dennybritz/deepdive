The Ethiopian parliament has approved a report that said 193
civilians and six policemen died during post-election violence in
2005, state media reported Wednesday, closing one of the darkest
chapters in the country's recent past.


The report, rejected by the opposition for being too lenient on
the government's action, said "security forces took the necessary
legal and proportional measures to protect" the stability of the
country, according to state media.


The violence in Addis Ababa and other cities in June and November
2005 amid protests over May polls "occured due to infancy of the
democratic system of the country", the report said.


Parliament approved the report in a vote Tuesday.


The figures compiled by the inquiry were three times higher than
the government's official death toll of 54 that prompted howls of
protest from Western donors.


Opposition groups have dismissed the report as "baseless",
arguing that it failed to hold the state accountable for the
bloody crackdown.


Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has expressed regret for the deaths
but laid the blame on the main opposition Coalition for Unity and
Democracy (CUD) which authorities have accused of trying to
foment a coup.


Nearly the entire CUD leadership is on trial on charges ranging
from treason to genocide and conspiracy for calling for the 2005
nationwide protests against the results of the May 15 elections
which they say were rigged.
