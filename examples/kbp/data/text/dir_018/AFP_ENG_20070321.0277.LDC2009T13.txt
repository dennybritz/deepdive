At least nine people have been killed and dozens injured in
clashes in southeast Nepal between Maoists and activists from an
ethnic minority group, officials said Wednesday.


"Seven men and two women were killed in clashes between
supporters of the Mahadhesi Janadhikar Forum (Mahadhesi People's
Rights Forum) and the Maoist Mahadhesi wing," said local police
superintendent Ram Kumar Khanal.


Around 30 others were injured of whom 12 were in a critical
condition, the police officer said.


"The clashes started after disputes between the two sides over
organising a programme at the same venue," said Khanal.


Shots were fired by both groups during the clash, but most of the
victims were beaten to death with bamboo poles, the police
officer said.


The violence occurred in Gaur, around 300 kilometres (186 miles)
southeast of Kathmandu, and a curfew has been imposed by local
authorities, home ministry spokesman Baman Prasad Neupane said.


Ethnic Mahadeshis from the lowland Terai region bordering India
have been protesting for greater representation in national
politics by holding a series of strikes, blockades and violent
demonstrations in their region.


The unrest has left close to 40 people dead since January.
