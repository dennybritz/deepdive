The European Commission affirmed Wednesday that it would seek
heavy fines against France for failing to cut nitrate levels in
regional waters, after it has examined new proposals to remedy
the problem.


The EU's executive body said it would ask Europe's top court to
fine France 28 million euros (37 million dollars) plus a sum of
117,882 euros each day that it fails to comply with an EU
regulation 20 years old.


The Commission maintains that nitrate levels are too high in 11
rivers in the northwest French region of Brittany. These rivers
are catchment areas for drinking water, after treatment.


The problem is due to agricultural development. Brittany accounts
for some seven percent of French farm production, but half the
country's pigs and poultry, and 30 percent of its cattle are
raised there.


But an environment spokeswoman said that the Commission wanted to
examine proposals submitted by the French government on March 13,
aimed at cutting nitrate levels, and that it expected to see some
sort of action plan.


"We foresee a dialogue in the shortest possible time on the
details of this initiative and the ways to implement them," EU
Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said in a statement.


The spokeswoman said the process could take several months.
