British finance minister Gordon Brown on Wednesday sprang a
budget surprise, announcing that he would cut the basic rate of
income tax from 22 percent to 20 percent in April 2008.


Brown, making what is widely seen as his final budget before
coming prime minister later this year, added that it was "the
lowest basic rate for 75 years" in Britain.


Rounding off his near hour-long budget speech, the chanellor of
the exchequer told parliament:


"We are able to hold to our pledge not to raise the basic rate of
income tax. Indeed to reward work, to ensure working families are
better off and to make the tax system fairer, I will from next
April cut the basic rate of income tax from 22 pence to 20 pence
(in the pound)."
