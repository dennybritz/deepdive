US reserves of crude oil increased last week but refined product
stocks decreased, the Department of Energy reported Wednesday.


Crude inventories rose by four million barrels to 329.3 million
in the week to March 16, it said. That was notably more than a
gain of just one million barrels forecast by analysts.


The DoE's weekly report showed that gasoline reserves fell by 3.4
million barrels to 210.5 million, against a forecasted dip of two
million barrels.


Distillate inventories, which include heating oil and diesel,
dropped by 1.7 million barrels to 118.7 million, slightly more
than predicted.


New York crude oil futures prices rose 44 cents to 59.69 dollars
a barrel in the wake of the government report.
