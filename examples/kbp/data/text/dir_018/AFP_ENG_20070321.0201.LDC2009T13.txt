Swedish police on Wednesday investigated an anonymous bomb threat
against a nuclear power plant but said they did not believe the
facility was in any danger.


A bomb squad was sent to the scene and roadblocks were set up
around the Forsmark plant, located about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Stockholm on the country's east coast, police
said.


"Our assessment is that there is no immediate danger surrounding
the threat," Uppsala police spokesman Christer Nordstroem told
AFP.


The plant was continuing to function as normal and employees were
not being evacuated from the plant, Forsmark information officer
Claes-Inge Andersson said.


Neither police nor Andersson would provide information on the
nature of the threat.


But Nordstroem said police had "not found anything that could be
a bomb".


The Forsmark facility, one of Sweden's three nuclear power
plants, has been hit by a series of safety incidents and
shutdowns in recent months, prompting calls for a rethink of the
plant's safety culture.
