A Croatian court on Wednesday jailed two former members of the
country's armed forces for torturing and killing ethnic Serbs
during its 1991-1995 war.


The court in the eastern town of Osijek sentenced Fred Margus to
14 years in prison, the state-run HINA news agency reported.


Margus, 46, was found guilty of detaining, torturing and killing
eight Serbs in the region of Cepin, near Osijek, in November
1991.


Tomislav Dilber, 34, received a three-year jail term for wounding
and abducting one of the victims who was later shot dead by
Margus.


A number of ethnic Serbs were kidnapped, tortured and killed in
the Osijek region at the outbreak of Croatia's war of
independence from the former communist Yugoslavia.


In a separate case, a Croatian lawmaker and former senior member
of the ruling conservative government is being investigated for
war crimes against Serbs in the area at around the same time.


Branimir Glavas, Osijek's wartime defence chief, is suspected of
having ordered abductions, torture and executions of Serb
civilians in the eastern town.


Croatia's proclamation of independence from the former Yugoslavia
sparked the war with Serb rebels who opposed the move.


According to police figures, at least 37 Serb civilians were
killed in Osijek at the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992.


Croatia's ability to prosecute war crimes committed by its own
nationals is seen as key condition for the country's bid to join
the European Union.
