Six people were killed and several wounded in separate attacks in
and around the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Wednesday, security
officials said.


Three people were killed and nine wounded in a mortar attack in
Al-Madaen, a small town south of Baghdad, police said.


In the capital, two people were killed when a roadside bomb
targeting a passing police patrol in Palestine street exploded.
Three policemen were wounded.


In another incident, a bystander was killed and two guards of the
finance ministry were wounded when US troops detonated a car bomb
they discovered next to the ministry, a defence ministry official
said.


The controlled explosion rocked central Baghdad and shook windows
in buildings as thick white smoke rose into the sky.


The US military did not immediately confirm that it had carried
out a controlled blast and said it was awaiting details of the
finance ministry explosion.
