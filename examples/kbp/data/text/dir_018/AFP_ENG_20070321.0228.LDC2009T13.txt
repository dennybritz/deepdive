The European Commission asked an EU court Wednesday to order
Poland to stop preparatory work for a planned road in an
ecologically fragile part of the country's northeast.


"It is with regret that the Commission is bringing this case to
the European Court of Justice," EU Environment Commissioner
Stavros Dimas said.


"But this course of action is necessary if these precious natural
sites of European significance are to be protected from
irreparable damage."


The European Union's executive arm said that although it
supported improvements to the country's road network, it could
not accept the "unjustified" damage that would be caused by the
construction of bypasses.


The Commission launched legal action in December against Warsaw,
arguing that the planned stretch of highway -- to ease traffic on
the nearby town of Augustow -- would plough through one of the
region's best-preserved forests.
