Hochtief, Germany's biggest construction company, welcomed on
Wednesday a decision by Spanish group ACS to acquire  25.08
percent of its capital, saying the move would stabilise its
shareholding structure.


The Munich-based investment group Custodia said in a statement
late on Tuesday it had sold its interest in Hochtief for 1.26
billion euros (1.8 billion dollars). The stake was bought by ACS,
another construction company which becomes the leading
shareholder.


Hochtief had been the subject of takeover talk ever since
Custodia announced in late 2006 that it wanted to sell its
interest.


German press reports had said the Australian bank Macquarie may
have been tempted to bid for Custodia's stake ahead of taking
full control of Hochtief in order to break it up.


The German group said in a statement Wednesday that it "welcomes
ACS's participation in its capital."


Hochtief said: "It will contribute to stabilising the
shareholding structure."


In Madrid ACS said the transaction would provide it with "a
platform to speed up its international expansion," adding that
for the moment it had no plans to increase its stake.


Hochtief shares were showing a loss of 3.01 percent at 68.63
euros in mid-day trading on the Frankfurt exchange, where
investors had speculated for weeks that the company would be
dismantled.


ACS was stable in Madrid, edging ip 0.09 percent to 44.09 euros.
