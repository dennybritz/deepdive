Egypt's largest opposition movement, the Muslim Brotherhood,
called on Wednesday for a boycott of next week's popular
referendum over controversial constitutional amendments.


"We will boycott the referendum and we call on the citizens to
boycott it as well," said movement spokesman Issam al-Aryan,
adding that fears of vote-rigging made participating in the
referendum pointless.


On Monday, the ruling party-dominated parliament overwhelming
passed amendments to 34 articles of the consitution which they
say will strengthen democracy and fight terrorism, while the
opposition maintains it will just strengthen the regime's grip on
power.
