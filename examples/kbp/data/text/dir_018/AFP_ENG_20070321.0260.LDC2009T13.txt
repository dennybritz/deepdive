ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet defended the track record of
the euro since its launch in 1999, calling on critics of the
shared currency to "meditate" on the eurozone's economic
performance since then.


"The euro is positive, that's clear," the Frenchman told the
European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee in
Brussels.


"I wouldn't say that it's the best of all worlds," he said, but
stressed that "we've created more than 12 million jobs in the
eurozone in the euro's first eight years and we created three
million in the previous eight years."


"Critics of the euro would do well to meditate on the numbers,"
he advised amid attacks from French presidential candidates that
the ECB focuses too much on price stability and not enough on
jobs and growth.


Rightwing frontrunner Nicolas Sarkozy and his Socialist rival
Segolene Royal have both targeted the ECB in their campaigns with
calls for a review of its mandate.


However, Trichet, a former Bank of France governor, renewed his
"inflexible" support for the ECB's independence and its
credibility.


"The ECB is independent by the will of the European people," he
said. "All the public opinion surveys confirm that there is very
strong popular support" both for the ECB's independence and its
focus on price stability."
