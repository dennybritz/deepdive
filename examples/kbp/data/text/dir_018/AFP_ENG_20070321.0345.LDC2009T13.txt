A US Congress panel defied President George W. Bush Wednesday by
authorizing subpoenas of White House officials to quiz them in a
mushrooming controversy over the sackings of eight prosecutors.


The move came one day after Bush stridently said he would resist
subpoenas, saying White House staff members would only be
interviewed by small groups of legislators and not under oath.


Critics have alleged that the firings of the prosecutors in
December were politically motivated.
