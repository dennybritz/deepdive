Livorno have sacked Daniele Arrigoni as their coach and replaced
him with Fernando Orsi, the faltering Serie A club said on
Wednesday.


Arrigoni paid the price for the Tuscan club's poor run of results
which has seen them slide to 13th place.


Arrigoni was sacked by Livorno president Aldo Spinelli in mid-
January only to be reinstated almost immediately following a
player revolt.


Orsi, 46, is a former Lazio goalkeeper and a former assistant of
current Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini.
