Ethiopia's parliament approved a report clearing the security
forces over post- election violence in 2005, in which 193
civilians and six policemen died, state media reported Wednesday.


The report has already been rejected by the opposition for being
too lenient on the government's actions.


"Security forces took the necessary legal and proportional
measures to protect" the stability of the country, said the
report, according to the state media.


The violence in Addis Ababa and other cities in June and November
2005, which sprang from protests over the May elections,
"occurred due to the infancy of the democratic system of the
country", the report said.


The figures compiled by the inquiry were more than three times
higher than the government's official death toll of 54 that arose
from two bouts of unrest. The bloodshed provoked strong protests
from Western donors.


Opposition groups have dismissed the report as "baseless",
arguing that it failed to hold the state accountable for the
bloody crackdown.


Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has expressed regret for
the deaths. But he has blamed the main opposition Coalition for
Unity and Democracy (CUD), which the authorities have accused of
trying to foment a coup.


Nearly the entire CUD leadership is currently on trial on charges
ranging from treason to genocide and conspiracy for calling for
nationwide protests against the results of the polls that they
allege were rigged.


The main opposition CUD argued that the results had been rigged.
