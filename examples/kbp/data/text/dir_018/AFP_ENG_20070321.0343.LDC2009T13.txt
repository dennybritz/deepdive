A million people are at risk of starvation in Niger this year and
400,000 urgently need help, the government's food crisis unit
(CCA) told AFP on Wednesday.


The head of the unit's emergency provisions department, Boubacar
Allakasso, said the government was preparing to send aid to the
rural areas affected.


In return, beneficiaries will have to join work schemes helping
to repair degraded land, dredge ponds or rebuild roads.


Last year Niger recorded a surplus of 457,237 tonnes of cereal,
thanks to unusually good rains and a reprieve from the parasites
that often destroy harvests.


But the ministry of rural development said almost two million
people would still go hungry in 2007 because shortages remained
in certain areas.


The Niger authorities were forced to draw heavily on the
country's emergency grain stocks in 2005, after poor harvests
damaged by five years of drought and attacked by plagues of
locusts left about 3.2 million people without food.


In February, the European Union donated six million euros (eight
million dollars) to help replenish grain stocks in the
impoverished country.
