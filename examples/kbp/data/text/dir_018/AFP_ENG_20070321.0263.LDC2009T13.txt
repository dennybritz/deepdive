Six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programmes will be
extended until Thursday, following a five-minute meeting by chief
delegates, officials said.


"The talks will be extended until tomorrow," South Korean
officials told journalists late Wednesday.


The announcement comes after North Korea refused to attend a
series of meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, until after it had
received 25 million dollars from a frozen Macau bank account as
promised.


Officials said the funds had still not been transferred to a
North Korean bank account in China.
