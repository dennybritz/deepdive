German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann denied on Wednesday he is in
negotiations with German outfit Hertha Berlin to make a switch
back to the Bundesliga from Arsenal.


Currently preparing with the German national side for their Euro
2008 qualifier against the Czech Republic on Saturday, Lehmann,
who is out of contract at the end of the season, insisted he has
had no contact with Berlin.


"I have not spoken to anybody at Berlin," said the 37-year-old.
"I don't really want to comment any further. I am in a situation
at the moment where I have to make a decision at some point, but
there is no fixed date for that to be made.


"Every week, a new club is linked with me, while everybody knows
I am also happy at Arsenal. I'd rather not talk about it all."


The 43-times capped goalkeeper pushed German legend Oliver Kahn
out of the the national XI before the 2006 World Cup.


But the fact that Arsenal can all but guarantee him regular
Champions League football must be a serious factor in his
decision.


"I must also say that I am enjoying my time with Arsenal. Indeed,
there are a few more other things which I must take into
consideration," added Lehmann.
