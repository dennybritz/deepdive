An anonymous package containing a threatening letter, a gun case
and some ammunition has been sent to Inter Milan owner Massimo
Moratti, the Corriere della Sera reported on Wednesday.


The paper said the parcel had been sent to Inter's headquarters
in Milan about 10 days ago. Milan prosecutors are believed to
have opened an investigation.


According to the Corriere, Inter have received menacing phone
calls and letters over the last eight months in protest at the
Italian football federation's decision to strip Juventus of the
2005-06 Serie A title and award it to Inter after the country's
match-fixing scandal.


Juventus also forfeited the 2004-05 title, and were demoted to
the second division with a nine-point handicap.
