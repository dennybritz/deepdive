German media giant Bertelsmann said Wednesday it was planning a
buying spree after its net profit soared in 2006.


But the company said it would wait until 2008 to make new
acquisitions in order to give itself time to absorb the cost of a
share buy-back that pushed up its debt.


"The group plans to hold back until the end of 2007," Bertelsmann
said in a statement.


"At that point, we will again have financial scope of between 1.2
and 1.5 billion euros per year (1.6 and 2.0 billion dollars) for
acquisitions and 700 million euros for other ongoing
investments," the group's CEO, Thomas Rabe, said.


Rabe announced that the company planned to create an investment
fund worth one billion euros with Morgan Stanley to finance the
acquisition of stakes in private equity companies.


Bertelsmann last year bought back 25.1 percent of its capital
from GBL, the holding company of Belgian financier Albert Frere.


The transaction was financed by the sale of BMG Music Publishing,
whose roster includes musicians such as Justin Timberlake and
Coldplay, to Vivendi for 1.63 billion euros.


This sale provided a strong boost for Bertelsmann's 2006
financial results.


Net profits more than doubled to 2.424 billion euros and turnover
increased by 7.9 percent to 19.3 billion euros.


The group said it aimed to see both its profit and turnover
increase further this year.
