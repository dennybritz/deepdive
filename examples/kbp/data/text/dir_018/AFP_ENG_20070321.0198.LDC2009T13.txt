A late own goal by Patiparn Phetphun saved J-League runners-up
Kawasaki Frontale from an embarrassing AFC Champions League
defeat as they drew 1-1 with 10-man Bangkok University on
Wednesday.


Trailing from Suriya Domtaisong's early opener, Frontale
struggled to break down the visitors until Patiparn put a cross
past his own 'keeper with 12 minutes to go.


Frontale beat Indonesia's Arema Melang in their opening match but
got off to a terrible start when Suriya, capitalising on a
Japanese mistake, shot past goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima on seven
minutes.


Suriya came close to doubling the advantage before Frontale came
back strongly in the second half, forcing five corners.


But they were unable to find a way past Bangkok 'keeper Weera
Koedpudsa, who saved from both Takahiro Kawamura and Yoshinobu
Moniwa.


Bangkok's hopes of an upset took a knock on 58 minutes when
Ramthep Chaipan was sent off for a second bookable offence, and
the pressure told when Patiparn directed Masaru Kurotsu's cross
into his own net.


Frontale pressed for a winner in the remaining time but Bangkok
held on for a memorable draw.
