Mark van Bommel was told on Wednesday he can now play in Bayern
Munich's Champions League quarter-final home leg against AC Milan
next month after his two-match suspension was reduced by UEFA on
appeal.


The Bayern midfielder still misses the German side's quarter-
final with AC Milan at the San Siro stadium on April 3, but is
now free to play in the return leg at Munich's Allianz Arena on
April 11.


Having been shown two yellow cards in Bayern's 2-1 win over Real
Madrid a fortnight ago, Dutchman Van Bommel had been expected to
sit out the quarter- final completely, but his coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld was delighted to have the influential midfielder back
for the home leg.


"This is a big relief for us and a great motivation for the clash
with Milan," said Hitzfeld. "The fact we will have him back for
the home leg is a big factor for us as he is very important to
the team's dynamics."
