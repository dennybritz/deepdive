The British economy would grow by 2.5-3.0 percent in 2008 and
2009, finance minister Gordon Brown forecast on Wednesday as he
delivered his likely final budget to parliament.


The Chancellor of the Exchequer's forecast compared with an
earlier estimate of 2.75-3.25 percent growth for 2007.


Brown's eleventh annual budget was widely forecast to be his last
before a move into 10 Downing Street to take over from Prime
Minister Tony Blair later this year.
