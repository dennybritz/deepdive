Inzamam-ul-Haq broke down in tears after he was dismissed for 37
in the World Cup match against Zimbabwe here on Wednesday, his
last appearance as national team captain.


Inzamam, who is playing in his final one-day international,
sobbed as he made his way off the Sabina Park pitch.


He was congratulated by the entire Zimbabwe team who all rushed
over to shake his hand while his own teammates formed a guard of
honour to see him back into the pavilion.


The 37-year-old Inzamam raised his bat to the sparse crowd,
removed his helmet and tearfully acknowledged the warm applause
after he was caught at long-on by Sean Williams off seamer
Tawanda Mupariwa in the 28th over of the Group D match.


Inzamam had been attempting to launch another huge six having
already smashed three over the ropes.


He finishes his 378-match one-day career with 11,739 runs to his
name, 10 centuries and 83 fifties.


Pakistan, who can't qualify for the next round after losing both
their opening games, have endured a tragedy-hit World Cup with
the death of coach Bob Woolmer.


Police in Jamaica have confirmed that the death of the 58-year-
old is being treated as suspicious.
