Israel's powerful workers union said on Wednesday it had called
off an eight- hour-old general strike that had paralysed airports
and essential services after it reached agreement with the
government to end a wages crisis.


"The strike is over and all the workers can return to work
normally," Histadrut labour federation chairman Ofer Eini
declared after signing an agreement with government officials.


Around 400,000 public workers went on strike at 9 am (0700 GMT)
after all-night reconciliation efforts between the government and
the Histadrut labour federation failed to resolve the row.
