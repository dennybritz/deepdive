The African Union (AU) on Wednesday denounced EU "double
standards" in taking action against Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe while ignoring abuses by other African leaders.


"I would have preferred that there were no double standards at
the European level, even for judging heads of state," the AU
representative in Brussels, ambassador Mahamat Annadif, told
reporters here.


"We talk about Zimbabwe, but for me there are other heads of
state who are just as important to avoid as Mugabe, but they have
support ... which means that today, no one says a word to them,"
he said, without actually naming any leaders.


He put some of the inconsistency down to Britain's attitude to
its former colony, which was to make Zimbabwe "its problem".


Annadif's remarks came after British Prime Minister Tony Blair
called for tougher EU measures against Zimbabwe, describing the
situation there as "appalling, disgraceful and utterly tragic."


The European Union slapped sanctions, including travel bans and
an arms embargo, on Mugabe's regime after controversial elections
in 2002 won by the long-serving ruler, which the opposition
insists were rigged.


The sanctions were extended last month until February 2008.


"We will press the European Union to widen the political
sanctions that were introduced in 2002 and introduced very much
as a result of our prompting at the time," Blair told parliament.


"That assets freeze and travel ban we will seek to extend as far
as we can."
