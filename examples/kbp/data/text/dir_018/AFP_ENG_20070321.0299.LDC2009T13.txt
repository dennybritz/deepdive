Morocco's supreme court has retired to consider its ruling on a
British extradition request for a man alleged to have
masterminded the largest robbery in British history, lawyers
said.


Lee Lamrani Ibrahim Murray, who holds dual Moroccan and British
citizenship, and another suspect, Paul Allen, are being held in
jail while the request is under consideration.


Murray's lawyer Issaoui Benmhili, who has been arguing against
extradition, said the court had not set a date for its decision.


"It is forbidden to extradite a Moroccan citizen whatever
allegations he is facing," the lawyer said, adding that there
were also technical failures in Britain's request.


Murray, who has a Moroccan father, is accused of masterminding
the theft of 53 million pounds (77 million euros, 104 million
dollars) from a Securitas cash depot in Tonbridge, Kent,
southeast England, in February 2006.


A martial arts cage fighter who is known to fight fans in
Britain, Murray has told the court he wishes to stay in Morocco.


He has already been sentenced to eight months' jail in Morocco
for drug use and possession and for assaulting a police officer.
