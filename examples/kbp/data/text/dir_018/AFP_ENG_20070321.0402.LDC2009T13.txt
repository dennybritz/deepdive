Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya retired hurt after hammering
a brisk 83 against Bangladesh in a World Cup match at the Queen's
Park Oval here on Wednesday.


The left-hander struck four sixes and six fours in his 77-ball
knock before leaving the field in pain. Sri Lanka were 137-1 off
25 overs at that stage.
