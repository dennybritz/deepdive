Eleven people were killed and dozens  wounded in separate attacks
in and around the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Wednesday, security
officials said.


Eight people were killed and 18 wounded in twin mortar attacks in
Al-Madaen, a small town south of Baghdad, police said.


One mortar landed in a residential area wounding several people,
prompting crowds to gather. A second mortar then smashed into the
crowd, causing most of the casualties.


In the capital, two people were killed when a roadside bomb
targeting a passing police patrol in Palestine street exploded.
Three policemen were wounded.


In another incident, a bystander was killed and two guards of the
finance ministry were wounded when US troops detonated a car bomb
they discovered next to the ministry, a defence ministry official
said.


The controlled explosion rocked central Baghdad and shook windows
in buildings as thick white smoke rose into the sky.


The US military did not immediately confirm that it had carried
out a controlled blast and said it was awaiting details of the
finance ministry explosion.
