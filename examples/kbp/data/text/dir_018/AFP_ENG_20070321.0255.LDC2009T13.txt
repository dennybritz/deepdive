The Spanish airline Iberia said on Wednesday it was open to an
eventual tie-up with another carrier but said that no such
alliance was under discussion.


Iberia "does not rule out the possibility of considering any
operation that would benefit the company," the carrier said in a
statement.


Iberia shares have risen sharply this week, with analysts
speculating that an "open skies" agreement between the United
States and the European Union, ending many resitrictions on
transatlantic civil aviation, would clear the way to a merger.


The European Parliament last week backed a resolution describing
a US-EU draft deal struck earlier this month "an important step
towards an integrated transatlantic aviation market that will be
to the benefit of consumers."


Lawmakers called on EU transport ministers to endorse the
agreement when they meet to vote on it March 22.


Iberia said in the statement to Spanish stock market authorities
on Wednesday that a US-European Union open skies accord would
mark an "important step" in the deregulation of the civil
aviation sector.


"The future for airline companies depends on a consolidation
process in which Iberia could play an important role," the
carrier added.


Reports have surfaced here of possible interest in Iberia by
Lufthansa of Germany and British Airways, which already has a 10
percent stake in the Spanish group.


Iberia shares were showing a gain of 0.84 percent at 3.61 euros
in mid-day trading in Madrid.
