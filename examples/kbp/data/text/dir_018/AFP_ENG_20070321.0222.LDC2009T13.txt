Calm returned to the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo on
Wednesday following a day of tensions involving a standoff
between the military and a former vice president's security
guards.


Stores in the neighborhood surrounding Jean-Pierre Bemba's
residence were open Wednesday and far fewer troops were visible
in the area.


"The situation has calmed," a senior DRC military officer told
AFP. He said troops were patrolling the area, though not in a
state of alert.


Dozens of soldiers and UN armoured vehicles were deployed outside
Bemba's residence Tuesday amid fears of clashes with his security
guards..


The situation in the Gombe district of the capital had been tense
since Thursday, when all soldiers still serving Bemba and another
former vice- president were ordered back to barracks.


Bemba and Azarias Ruberwa, whose rebel movements battled
Kinshasha until 2003, were vice-presidents during a post-war
transition to democratic rule overseen by the United Nations.


The transition process ended last year with the first democratic
elections in more than four decades. Joseph Kabila was
inaugurated as president in December.


Both Bemba and Ruberwa oppose the withdrawal of their military
protection. They say a guard of 12 police officers assigned to
them by presidential decree is insufficient.


Bemba's chief of staff, Fidele Babala, said Tuesday night there
should be a gradual withdrawal of the troops.
