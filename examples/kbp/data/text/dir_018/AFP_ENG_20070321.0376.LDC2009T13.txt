Italian unemployment fell to 6.8 percent of the workforce last
year, its lowest level since 1993, from 7.7 percent in 2005, the
national statistics office said Wednesday.


Joblessness came to 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter from 6.7
percent in the third.


"These are excellent results, which begin to show the effects of
government budget measures," said Labour Minister Cesare Damiano.


Marco Valli, an economist with the bank UBM, attributed the
decline in fourth- quarter unemployment to "a mixture of stronger
growth, labour market flexibility and the legalisation of
immigrant workers."
