Werder Bremen striker Ivan Klasnic spoke of his relief on
Wednesday having been told he is set for a second kidney
transplant after a new donor was discovered.


The 27-year-old was diagnosed with kidney failure during the
Budesliga's winter break and has not played a game for Bremen
since last December.


But in January, the Croatian's body rejected a kidney from his
mother leading to fears his career could be over.


But now a new kidney has been found with a transplant scheduled
for after Easter which doctors believe should be accepted by
Klasnic's body.


"I feel a huge weight has been lifted," he said.


"I hope it works out this time and things start looking up. I am
hoping to be back to full form by next season."


With the 27-year-old out of contract by the end of the season,
Bremen have offered him a year's extension and the holder of 29
Croatian caps will make a decision based on the operation's
success.


"The club have been good to me and talked about my contract, but
we will talk about it again in the next few weeks and see how
things go after the operation," he said.
