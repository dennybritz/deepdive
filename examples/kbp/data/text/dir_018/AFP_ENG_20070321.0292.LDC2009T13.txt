US shares drifted in a narrow range the opening Wednesday as
investors cautiously awaited a statement at the conclusion of a
two-day Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.


In opening action, the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted down
a fractional 0.56 point to 12,287.54.


The Nasdaq composite advanced 5.44 points (0.23 percent) to
2,413.65 and the broad-market Standard & Poor's 500 gained
1.09 points (0.08 percent) to 1,412.03.


With no economic data on tap, the markets awaited the Federal
Reserve statement, due later in the day. No change in the federal
funds rate of 5.25 percent was expected, but investors were
expected to look for hints of whether the next move on rates
would be up or down.


"The market has a tendency to be volatile after the Fed release,"
said Dick Green at Briefing.com.


"The Fed hasn't changed rates for nine months now, yet every
policy statement is overanalyzed as if there is some secret
message that a rate cut is coming next meeting. The Fed is
getting the slower economic growth and housing correction they
wanted when they started raising rates. Inflation has yet to ease
as much as desired. There are strong reasons for the Fed to keep
a steady course."
