British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett has arrived on a visit
to the oil- rich United Arab Emirates, the Foreign Office said on
Wednesday.


She is set to discuss bilateral and regional issues including
trade and security with officials including Foreign Minister
Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.


The UAE is Britain's ninth largest export market worldwide.


"It is a great honour to be here in Abu Dhabi," Beckett said in a
statement.


"In recent years the UAE has been a huge success story thanks to
the vision and determination of the leadership.


"The United Kingdom and the UAE enjoy excellent relations.


"We are working in partnership with the UAE at many levels,
including on political issues, trade, the education sector and
the environment."


The visit is Beckett's fourth to the Middle East in recent
months: she went to Iraq and Egypt last September, Jordan and
Lebanon in December, and Israel and the West Bank last month.


Prime Minister Tony Blair visited in December last year, praising
the UAE for holding its first elections, albeit on a very limited
franchise, and for the way it had transformed itself economically
in recent years.
