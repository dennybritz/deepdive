A huge sea-based targeting radar and radars aboard two Aegis
destroyers tracked a long-range missile launched from California
in a missile defense test, the Pentagon said Wednesday.


The test, which was conducted Tuesday, was designed to assess how
well the system performs using combinations of weapons and
sensors to engage a ballistic missile, the Missile Defense Agency
said.


No interceptor missile was fired in the test, but a command
center in Colorado Springs, Colorado simulated an interception
using tracking data from the sea- based X-band (SBX) radar in
Alaska's Aleutian Islands.


The SBX radar, which is mounted on sea-going oil drilling
platform, is 280 feet high and weighs almost 50,000 tons.


It is designed to detect and discriminate between small objects
in space.


It was used once before in a missile defense test in September to
track a long range missile.


The target missile in Tuesday's test was launched from Vandenberg
Air Force base in California.


The two Aegis destroyers that took part in the test also tracked
the target missile with their onboard SPY-1 radar and targeted it
with their SM-3 surface to air missiles, the agency said.


The agency is planning missile intercept tests later this year.
