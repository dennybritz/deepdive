The world's biggest high-tech trade show, the CeBIT, wrapped up
Wednesday after drawing 480,000 visitors during the week-long
event -- a 10-percent increase over 2006.


Organisers said they were able to stem a mass exodus of guests
that began when the Internet bubble burst in 2001.


"We have turned the trend around with the 2007 CeBIT," said Ernst
Raue, a member of the board of Deutsche Messe, which puts on the
fair each year.


Some 6,100 exhibitors from 77 countries came to the northern
German city of Hanover for the annual event.


Raue told a news conference that 11 billion euros (15 billion
dollars) in business deals had been sealed at the fair.


The CeBIT highlighted new advances in the computer, consumer
electronics and telecommunications industries with a particular
focus on Internet telephony, navigation devices, high-speed
mobile online connections and next generation DVD players.


An overhaul of the CeBIT, short for Centre for Office and
Information Technology, is planned for 2008, trimming a day off
the schedule and offering an improved forum for sector
professionals.
