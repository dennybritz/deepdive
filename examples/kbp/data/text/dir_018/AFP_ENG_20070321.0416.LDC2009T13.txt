Russia's independent mining union accused the government on
Wednesday of abandoning coalminers to their fate, as the country
mourned the deaths of 108 people in an underground blast at a
Siberian coalmine.


"The state has abandoned all responsibility for the extremely
difficult and dangerous conditions that miners work in," the
Independent Miners' Union wrote in an open letter to President
Vladimir Putin distributed to journalists in Moscow.


"Security regulations are too loose in most Russian mines," the
union's chairman, Alexander Sergeyev, said.


Nearly all coalmines in Russia have been privatised since the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and a total of 456 miners
have died in accidents since December 1992, said the union, which
represents 25,000 members.


Most of these incidents, including Monday's fatal explosion, were
caused by methane gas build-up, Sergeyev said, calling for
"mandatory gas extraction, as they do in the United States."


The independent union also urged the state to require miners be
paid independently of their production output.


"Miners prefer to take risks and not spend time on their own
security so as not to lose 70 percent of their salaries, which
are entirely dependent on productivity."
