A US plan to deploy elements of a missile defence shield in
central Europe is a throwback to the Cold War and shows a lack of
respect for Washington's EU and NATO partners, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday.


"The American decision is presented in such a way that is
disrespectful to its partners in the EU and even in relation to
other members of NATO," he told Russia's parliament.


Lavrov's comment echoed splits within the Western military
alliance over the controversial anti-missile defence system,
which is fiercely opposed by Russia.


Germany on Monday said NATO should be consulted about the US
plans after Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned
against a new arms race on the continent.


A senior French defence official, Robert Ranquet, also said
Monday that France sees no need to rush on developing the shield.


The United States says it wants to extend an anti-missile defence
system to Poland and the Czech Republic and also possibly to a
country in the Caucasus region on Russia's southern border.


Lavrov said Russian military experts were hoping to discuss the
missile shield with their US counterparts.


"It is necessary to convince them that it is possible to
neutralize hypothetical threats in ways that do not create a real
threat for the Russian Federation," he said.


Washington insists the shield is meant to guard against threats
from states such as Iran and North Korea and would not threaten
Russia.
