The 79,000 tickets for the Paris concert of reunited rock group
The Police sold out in just an hour and a half on Wednesday, the
RTL radio network which is partnering the show said.


The group's Paris concert is being held at the Stade de France
football stadium on September 29 as part of an international
reunion tour to mark their 30th anniversary, one of the music
world's most eagerly anticipated comebacks.


The three-member band -- British frontman Sting, guitarist Andy
Summers and drummer Stewart Copeland -- will kick off the tour in
Vancouver on May 28, playing across North American before heading
to Europe later in the year.


The Police was one of the biggest groups of the late 1970s and
early 1980s thanks to songs such as "Roxanne" and "Every Breath
You Take".


The group never formally split up but just drifted apart after
their successful 1983 album "Synchronicity."
