French President Jacques Chirac gave his backing Wednesday to
right-wing presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy, announcing
that the interior minister would leave the government on March 26
to focus full-time on the race.


Chirac said he would give his "vote and support" to the 52-year-
old Sarkozy, the candidate of the governing right-wing Union for
a Popular Movement (UMP), in a televised statement pre-recorded
at the Elysee presidential palace.


Polls show Sarkozy currently leading the race to succeed Chirac
in the April-May election, ahead of the Socialist Segolene Royal,
53, and the centrist Francois Bayrou, 55.


Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, 78, comes fourth, well ahead
of the eight remaining candidates.


Sarkozy's five years at the French interior ministry, from 2002
to 2004 and again from 2005 to 2007, did more than anything in
his 30-year career to shape his image as a tough-talking man of
action.


Royal's Socialist Party (PS) has accused Sarkozy of using his
powers as interior minister -- the number two position in the
French government -- to advance his campaign.


Sarkozy had dismissed the criticism, saying only that he would
step down before the start of the official campaign on April 9.
He is expected to be succeeded at the interior ministry by
Overseas Minister Francois Baroin, a protege of Chirac.
