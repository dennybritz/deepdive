The Dutch government would not give in to demands of hostage-
takers, its foreign minister said in Afghanistan Wednesday when
asked about the exchange of five Taliban prisoners for an Italian
hostage.


"When we create a situation where you can buy the freedom of
Taliban fighters when you catch a journalist, then in the short
term there will be no journalists anymore," Foreign Minister
Maxime Verhagen said.


"The Dutch government will not give in to such a situation
because otherwise you will support the taking of hostages and we
don't want it," he told reporters at a media briefing at the end
of a three-day visit.


Five Taliban prisoners were handed back to the extremist movement
on Monday to free Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo from
15 days in captivity.


The correspondent's Afghan driver was beheaded and the fate of
his translator is unclear.


The exchange has been strongly criticised in Afghanistan with the
United Nations and US embassy saying they did not negotiate with
"terrorists."


The Netherlands has 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, many based in
troubled southern Uruzgan province.
