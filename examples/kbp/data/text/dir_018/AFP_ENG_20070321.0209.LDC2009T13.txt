Unheralded Chinese Shang Linyang shot a two-under-par 70 for a
surprise two-shot lead in the opening round of the 230,000-dollar
Binhai Ladies Open on Wednesday.


The 25-year-old from Shanghai, bolstered by home support, shot
five birdies against three bogeys to head a strong field in the
last event of this season's Ladies Asian Golf Tour.


"I'm very pleased to be the leader among the strong field of
Koreans, Japanese, Thai and the US girls. I didn't expect to be
at helm today, but this is a good tonic to spur me on tomorrow,"
she said.


"When my name was called I was a little afraid. Moreover, my
flight was the first for the morning session. It was a two-ball
flight and I hate moving fast," she added.


"I calmed myself and the birdies I posted on the first two holes
erased whatever fear that was in me."


Shang led three Korean players -- Yoon Su-jung, Na Ye-jin and Kim
Hae-jung -- with order of merit leader Libby Smith among a host
of players on 74.
