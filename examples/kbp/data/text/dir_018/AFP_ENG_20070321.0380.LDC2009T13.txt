Scotland midfielder Nigel Quashie was on Wednesday ruled out of
forthcoming Euro 2008 qualifiers because of an injury to his left
ankle.


Quashie has been allowed to return to West Ham after Scotland
team doctors deemed him unfit for the March 24 fixture against
Georgia and against Italy four days later. At this stage no one
has replaced Quashie in the squad.


The former West Brom midfielder had five stitches inserted in an
ankle he injured during his side's 4-3 home defeat to Tottenham
on March 4.


An infection in the wound caused the ankle to swell up and he
missed his club's victory at Blackburn on Saturday.


He did not train at the Scotland squad's first session on
Tuesday, instead helping to launch a new away kit at a gathering
of supporters in Glasgow.


But he will now miss manager Alex McLeish's first game in charge
and that against the world champions in Bari four days later.


The withdrawal is the first to hit McLeish since he named a
26-man squad, but he was already missing key pair Darren Fletcher
and James McFadden through injury.
