Several hundred German shepherds, together with 30 sheep, rallied
at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate against excessive bureaucracy in the
European Union Wednesday.


The demonstrators from across the country, many in traditional
rural dress, complained that under new EU guidelines, shepherds
were required to keep more detailed records of their flocks and
report them to the authorities.


The rules also dictate that sheep are to be given new ear tags
more frequently and may not be transported if they are in a late
stage of pregnancy, which the shepherds called an unnecessary
burden for small-scale keepers of livestock.


Some 30,000 shepherds in Germany keep 2.6 million animals, the
rally organisers said.


Germany currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
