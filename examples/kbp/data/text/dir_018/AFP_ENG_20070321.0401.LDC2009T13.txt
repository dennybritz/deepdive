Clashes between foreign Al-Qaeda militants and pro-government
tribesmen in northwest Pakistan have left 114 people dead,
Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao told AFP Wednesday.


Sherpao said 84 Uzbek militants and 30 local tribesmen, including
nine civilians, had been killed during three days of fighting in
the tribal area of South Waziristan.


Another 83 Uzbeks were captured by the tribal forces, he said.
