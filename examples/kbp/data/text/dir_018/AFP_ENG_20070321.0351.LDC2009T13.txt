Two Russian air force pilots ejected from their jets and survived
after their MiG-29 fighter planes collided in mid-air on
Wednesday, a senior officer was quoted as saying by Interfax news
agency.


"After colliding in the air, the fighter pilots managed to eject.
They have already been picked up by the search-and-rescue
helicopter and taken to the airfield," Colonel Alexander
Drobyshevsky, an aide to the air force command said, Interfax
reported.


Their medical condition was satisfactory, he said.


The incident took place near the Millerovo air base in the
northwest of Rostov, near Russia's border with Ukraine, Interfax
