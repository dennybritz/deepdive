Kuwait on Wednesday freed 472 prisoners after Emir Sheikh Sabah
al-Ahmad al- Sabah pardoned them on the occasion of the emirate's
national and liberation days, which fell on February 25 and 26.


The pardon, which also marked the emir's first year in power,
stipulated reducing the jail terms of 1,333 other prisoners, the
interior ministry said.


Of those released, 300 were foreigners and the rest Kuwaiti
citizens. They included 64 women, most of them expatriates.


Liberation day on February 26 marked 16 years since a US-led
multinational coalition liberated the emirate after seven months
of Iraqi occupation.
