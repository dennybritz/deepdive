Hardcore computer game fans began queueing Wednesday to be the
first in Britain to get their hands on Sony's Playstation 3 ahead
of the next-generation console's long-awaited European launch.


Virgin Megastore's flagship outlet on London's Oxford Street
opened its basement to games-mad fans at midday (1200 GMT) -- a
full 36 hours before the consoles go on sale at midnight
Thursday.


But that was not early enough for determined enthusiast Ritatsu
Thomas, 17, who sat outside the store in the chilly darkness from
5:00 am -- and duly secured first place in the queue.


"It will mean a lot to be the first person in Britain to get
one," he told AFP.


The graphic design student from southwest London brought a
sleeping bag, a flask, vitamin pills and, oddly enough, scissors
and some masking tape just in case he might need some.


"Think ahead," he said.


Virgin provided free food and drinks for those queueing up,
barricaded off in the basesment and sat on wooden boxes. The
store was to lay on free taxis Friday to whisk the hardcore home
-- to avoid potential muggers.


Heavy security was laid on throughout the night after the US
launch saw shootings and fist fights.


The PS3 was launched in Japan and the United States in November,
but production problems delayed the European roll-out.


The 60-gigabyte version on sale in Europe costs 425 pounds (599
euros, 830 dollars).


PS3 comes with a Cell chip processor and a Blu-ray DVD disc,
allowing for more true-to-life graphics and for playing High
Definition movies. It also boasts a high-speed Internet
connection.
