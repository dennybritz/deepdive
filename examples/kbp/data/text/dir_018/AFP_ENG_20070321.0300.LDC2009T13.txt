Britain's economy will slow over the next two years but inflation
will move back towards target, finance minister Gordon Brown
forecast Wednesday as he delivered his likely final budget.


Brown, widely regarded as a prime minister in waiting, predicted
economic growth of 2.5-3.0 percent in 2008 and 2009, compared
with a forecast of 2.75-3.25 percent growth for 2007.


All three forecasts were unchanged from his predictions made in
December.


The chancellor of the exchequer added that Britain's economy was
the fastest growing among its peers in the Group of Seven (G7)
industrialized countries.


"Growth is stronger this year than the euro area, stronger than
Japan and it is stronger even than in America," Brown said.


Brown's eleventh annual budget was widely forecast to be his last
before a move into 10 Downing Street to take over from Prime
Minister Tony Blair later this year.


He added that the annual rate of British inflation would fall
towards 2.0 percent this year -- the Labour government's target
-- and would remain "on target" in 2008 and 2009. Inflation stood
at 2.8 percent in February.


"Inflation has never gone beyond 3.0 percent," Brown noted.


However, inflation had shot up to 3.0 percent in December, above
the Bank of England's government-set target of 2.0 percent, and
the highest level since Labour came to power in 1997.
