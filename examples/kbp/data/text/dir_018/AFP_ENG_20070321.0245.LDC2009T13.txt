British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain would urge the
European Union to impose tougher sanctions on Zimbabwe,
describing the situation there as "appalling, disgraceful and
utterly tragic".


"We will press the European Union to widen the political
sanctions that were introduced in 2002 and introduced very much
as a result of our prompting at the time," Blair told parliament
during his weekly question-and-answer session.
