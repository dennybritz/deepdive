The Council of Europe on Wednesday set out a package of 40
measures to fight racism in schools, against a background of what
it said was a rising tide of racism among young people in Europe.


"Across Europe, racist incidents among young people are on the
rise," said Terry Davis, the Council's secretary General.


"School is the place to make or break our efforts to stop this
trend."


The non-binding proposals, released on International Day for the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, were drawn up by the
Council's European Commission against Racism and Intolerance
(ECRI).


They included measures to ensure that member states gathered all
the information they needed to know the status of minority
groups.


ECRI also urged schools to help kids from minority groups to
learn the language being used for teaching -- but cautioned
against putting them in separate classes.


It said all schools should take an active role in fighting racism
to educate both staff and students on the issue, and to punish
any racist act seriously.


Governments would also have to ensure that sufficient funds were
provided to implement the policies.


"I encourage governments to take immediate action," said Davis.


The Strasbourg-based Council of Europe, founded in 1949,
comprises 46 countries, including 21 countries from Central and
Eastern Europe.
