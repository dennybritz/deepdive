Britain's security services are to receive an extra 86.4 million
pounds (127.2 million euros, 169.3 million dollars) in the coming
financial year, finance minister Gordon Brown announced
Wednesday.


The cash announced in Brown's annual budget will go towards
funding the domestic security service MI5, its foreign security
counterpart MI6 and the Government Communications Headquarters
(GCHQ) "listening post."


Brown told lawmakers that the decision meant that Britain's total
annual security budget was now 2.25 billion pounds, more than
double the figure allocated before the September 11, 2001 attacks
in the United States.


Officials said they could not give further information about what
the money would be spent on because of the sensitive nature of
the work involved.


Last November, Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, the outgoing head of
MI5, warned that the agency was tracking over 1,600 suspects from
200 groups, most with ties to Al-Qaeda.


Nearly 30 terror plots were under investigation, she added.


Britain is facing a "severe" risk from terrorism -- the second-
highest level -- meaning an attack "is highly likely and
indicates a continuing high level of threat," according to MI5's
website.
