The skeleton of a five-million-year-old whale has been found in
the Tuscan vineyard that produces the world-famous Brunello di
Montalcino wine.


"A group of paleontologists were digging in January in the
Castello Banfi vineyards and found a whale's vertebra," a
spokeswoman for Winenews, a wine promotion agency, told AFP.


"They continued their search and found the animal's entire
skeleton, about 10 meters (33 feet) long," Daniella Vidotto said.


Explaining that the region was underwater five million years ago,
Vidotto said it was a magnet for paleontologists. "A dolphin
skeleton was found a few years ago in our area, in Pienza, as
well as lots of seashells," she said.


The region in the province of Siena is known for its wine, and
Brunello di Montalcino was named the best wine in the world last
year by the prestigious US magazine Wine Spectator.
