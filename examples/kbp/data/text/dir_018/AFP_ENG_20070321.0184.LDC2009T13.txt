Indian police arrested on Wednesday a drunken passenger on a New
Delhi-bound flight from Bangkok after he threatened to blow up
the plane, an airline spokesman said.


State-run airline Indian's flight with 88 people aboard was
forced to make an emergency landing in the eastern Indian city of
Kolkata, airline spokesman Ashok Sharma said.


"Flight 854 is being searched for explosives," he said.


The detained passenger was a Mexican citizen who was in "an
inebriated condition," Sharma said.


"The plane, which was carrying 82 passengers and six crew
members, made an emergency landing in Kolkata at 15:15 hours
(0945 GMT), where the man was taken into custody," Sharma said.


"No explosives have been found on his person, but the man had
been saying he had explosives on board the flight and so
naturally the passengers have been offloaded and the plane is
being searched," he said.


Bomb disposal units and army commandos rushed to the site and
Kolkata's international airport was on top security alert, Bureau
of Civil Aviation Security officials said.


"Bomb and hijack drills were activated the moment we were
alerted," an official told AFP in New Delhi.
