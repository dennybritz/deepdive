Six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programmes will be
extended until Thursday, following a five-minute meeting by chief
delegates, officials said.


"The talks will be extended until tomorrow," South Korean
officials told journalists late Wednesday.


The announcement comes after North Korea refused to attend a
series of meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, until after it had
received 25 million dollars from a frozen Macau bank account as
promised.


Officials said the funds had still not been transferred to a
North Korean bank account in China.


The latest round of the six-nation talks began Monday on an
optimistic note with the United States announcing it had resolved
a long-running financial sanctions dispute with North Korea that
had been the major stumbling block in the forum.


Washington had frozen the Macau bank account amid allegations of
money laundering and counterfeiting by the North Korean regime.


Macau authorities said the money would be transferred into a
North Korean account, but by Wednesday the funds had yet to be
delivered.


North Korea, which conducted its first atomic weapons test in
October last year, agreed last month to shut down its main
nuclear reactor at Yongbyon by mid-April and allow UN inspectors
back into the country.


In return, the impoverished regime would initially receive 50,000
tonnes of heavy fuel for energy use.
