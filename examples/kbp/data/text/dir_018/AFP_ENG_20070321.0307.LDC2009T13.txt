The Austrian group Red Bull, the world's leading maker of energy
drinks, said on Wednesday it wanted to double sales by 2010 to
6.0 billion cans and had no plans for a stock market flotation.


"We're still lacking five or six big markets where we are in the
process of entering successfully," Red Bull chief Dietrich
Mateschitz told the newspaper Der Standard, citing India, China,
Japan, South Korea and Pakistan.


He voiced frustration with French authorities which have refused
to authorise the sale of Red Bull products because of the
presence of taurine, an organic acid, among their ingredients.


Red Bull sold 3.038 billion cans in more than 130 countries last
year, increasing sales by 22.9 percent over 2005 to 2.641 billion
euros (3.5 billion dollars).


The company, founded 20 years ago, said sales jumped 30 percent
in the United States, which accounted for two thirds of its
turnover last year.


Mateschitz owns 49 percent of the company, with the remainder
controlled by the Yoovidhya family of Thailand.


He told the paper there were plans for the group to be quoted on
the stock market.


"Red Bull has no need of financing nor does it have any intention
of benefiting from advantages said to come from a stock market
flotation," he said.
