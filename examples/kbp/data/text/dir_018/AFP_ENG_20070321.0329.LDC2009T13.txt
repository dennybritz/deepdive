Dutch ministers Wednesday urged the Afghan government to step up
its presence and development in the troubled south, where Taliban
insurgents are most entrenched, saying NATO cannot do it alone.


They also announced a three-million-euro (nearly four-million-
dollar) project to boost safety in Uruzgan province, where many
of the 2,000 Dutch troops here are based, highlighting the
incapacity of the Afghan forces.


Afghan security forces struggled to fill the vacuum "when we do
succeed in liberating a province or region," Defence Minister
Eimert van Middelkop told reporters.


"That is one of the things that is still worrying me because a
vacuum is a very dangerous thing."


Van Middelkop and his counterparts for foreign affairs and
development cooperation wrapped up a three-day tour of
Afghanistan with a meeting with President Hamid Karzai Wednesday.


They raised concern about a new law giving amnesty for war crimes
committed in Afghanistan's nearly 25 years of brutal war, Foreign
Minister Maxime Verhagen said.


They also spoke against moves by parliament to curb the media,
saying freedom of expression was essential for democracy -- the
reason international forces were in Afghanistan, he said.


Minister for Development Cooperation Bert Koenders said the trip
showed there needed to be a "quality and quantity leap forwards
in the development field."


"We have made very clear to the government here that they have to
reach out to the south, and to the Pashtuns in the south, to make
clear also that the ministers visit the south regularly..."


"NATO cannot do this by itself," he said.


"We cannot simply be Western troops showing the flag. It has to
be combined by clear developments efforts by the administration."
