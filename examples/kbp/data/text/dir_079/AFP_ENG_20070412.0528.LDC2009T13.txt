Europe's human rights court on Thursday ruled that Bulgaria had
violated the religious rights of a swimming instructor who lost
her job over her Evangelical Christian faith.


The European Court of Human Rights ordered Bulgaria to pay
Kalinka Todorova Ivanova around 4,500 euros (6,000 dollars) in
damages.


They ruled she had been fired from her swimming instructor job at
the River Shipbuilding and Navigation School in the northeastern
town of Ruse because of her religious beliefs.


She was also awarded 2,500 euros to cover costs and expenses.


The Court found that her right to freedom of religion under
Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been
violated.


Ivanova, 57, was a member of a Christian Evangelical group called
"Word of Life". It is one of several US-based Protestant
congregations that became active in Bulgaria in the 1990s but
were denied legal status in the country.


When she was dismissed from her job in December 1995, the school
administration claimed the requirements for the position had
changed.


But the judges in Strasbourg concluded that Ivanova's "employment
had been terminated not simply because the requirements for her
post had been altered, but in reality because of her religious
beliefs and affiliation with Word of Life."


Only a couple months before Ivanova was dismissed, the school's
headmaster had been forced to step down for, among other things,
having failed to dismiss staff members who were followers of Word
of Life and for tolerating the group's activities.
