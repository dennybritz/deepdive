The head of Bangladesh's military-backed government said Thursday
he expected to stage elections by the end of 2008 and hand over
power afterwards.


"I firmly believe the much expected parliamentary elections can
be held before the end of 2008,' Fakhruddin Ahmed said in a
televised address to the nation.


"We are determined to hand over power to an elected government
after holding free and fair elections through carrying out
necessary programmes and administrative reforms as soon as
possible," he said.
