Turkey was condemed by the European Court of Human Rights on
Thursday over the ill-treatment of 13 prisoners in two separate
cases at different detention centres.


Twelve detainees complained of having been hit with truncheons
and wooden planks by prison administrators, warders and gendarmes
at Buca prison in the western Turkish city of Izmir for refusing
to be searched in 1995.


The Turkish government claimed they had injured themselves
falling down stairs.


But the European court said the explanation was not plausible and
concluded that the prisoners "had been beaten and injured as
alleged."


It also said an investigation into the incident had serious
shortcomings, especially the disappearance of a case file and a
refusal to take legal action against the gendarmes.


It awarded the applicants 8,000 euros each (10,500 dollars).


In the other case, gendarmes beat a man from Sirnak in southeast
Turkey, suspected of being a supporter of the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), deprived him of water and food and
prevented him from going to the toilet.


Haci Ozen was detained secretly for three days before officially
being remanded for questioning by police.


The European court judged that the man had been the victim of six
violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, including
inhumane treatment.


It awarded him 15,000 euros.
