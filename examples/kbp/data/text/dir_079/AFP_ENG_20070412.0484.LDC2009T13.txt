International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo Rato appealed Thursday
for a breakthrough in global trade talks ahead of weekend
meetings here due to be attended by WTO director general Pascal
Lamy.


Rato urged all the major players to go "the extra mile," as
ministers from the United States, the European Union, Brazil and
India met in New Delhi in a bid to salvage the World Trade
Organization's "Doha" talks.


For a deal to happen, there is a "special responsibility for
leadership from certainly the US, Europe and Japan, but also for
the large emerging economies," the IMF managing-director told a
news conference.


He said that Lamy would address IMF members at an annual spring
meeting in Washington Saturday, to push what is billed as a once-
in-a-generation chance to lower trade barriers and bring millions
out of poverty.


Rato stressed that a breakthrough is required on rich powers'
farming subsidies, but also on the industrial tariffs levied by
major developing nations.


He called on negotiators "to make the final effort to give the
world a very important push in the right direction, to
consolidate this historical momentum of growth that is changing
the lives of so many people in so many countries."


"What is needed now is the extra mile that is needed for an
agreement."
