An explosion inside the Iraqi parliament building canteen on
Thursday was carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive
belt, a security official said.


The official spoke from the scene of the blast on condition of
anonymity because he was not authorised to release the
information.


He said blood and pieces of flesh were scattered across the
cafeteria after the attack, which killed two MPs.
