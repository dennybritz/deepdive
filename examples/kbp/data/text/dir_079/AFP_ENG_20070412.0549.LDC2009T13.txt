About 15 people were injured Thursday in Milan during clashes
between police and hundreds of residents of the northern city's
Chinatown over a parking ticket, Italian media reported.


A shopkeeper of Chinese origin was loudly protesting a fine of 40
euros (54 dollars) for parking illegally when a crowd gathered
that swelled to around 350, according to the all-news channel Sky
TG24.


Dozens of police were deployed to the scene, which degenerated
into running battles that left 15 injured including 11 police
officers, Sky said.


"It's not an isolated case," said China's consul in Milan, Limin
Zhang. "We've been under heavy harassment for two months now. I'm
here to defend the interests of Chinese shopkeepers who pay their
taxes and follow the law," the ANSA news agency reported.


For her part, Milan mayor Letizia Moratti told a news conference:
"We won't tolerate any free zone in the city. I can't accept that
a traffic violation can lead to such incidents in our city."


Some 12,000 Chinese nationals reside legally in Milan, according
to census figures.
