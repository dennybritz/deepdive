Turkey's army chief pushed for a military incursion into northern
Iraq on Thursday to crack down on Turkish Kurd rebels he said had
sought refuge there.


"If you ask me whether a cross-border operation is needed, yes it
is needed. It would be useful," chief of general staff, General
Yasar Buyukanit, told a rare press conference.


"But there is a second dimension to that: it requires a political
decision," he said. "If the armed forces are given this mission,
they are strong enough to carry out such operations."


Buyukanit's comments are the latest in a series of official
Turkish statements that have ratcheted up the pressure on
neighbouring Iraq over the presence of Kurdish rebels in the
north of the country.


On Wednesday, Turkey called on Iraq to take "urgent" measures
against the rebels, who Ankara says enjoy unrestricted movement
in the region and are able to obtain weapons and explosives for
cross-border attacks on Turkish targets.
