European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said Thursday
that the financial markets were not wrong in betting on a further
rise in eurozone interest rates in June.


Asked at a news conference whether market expectations for a June
rate rise were correct, Trichet said: "I will not say anything to
change market expectations over the next one or two months."


Nevertheless, the Frenchman insisted that the ECB had not "pre-
committed" to any pre-set timetable of interest rate moves.


The bank, known as the guardian of the euro, held its benchmark
"refi" refinancing rate steady at 3.75 percent at its regular
monthly policy-setting meeting on Thursday, just a month after
raising them by a quarter of a percentage point to their highest
level in five and a half years.


ECB watchers are nevertheless expecting the ECB to tighten
monetary conditions again in the coming months, with the
overwhelming majority of analysts betting on a rise in the refi
to 4.0 percent in June.


Trichet said that "there was no discussion" within the ECB's
policy-making governing council of possible move this month.


The decision to hold rates steady was "unanimous", he said.


Nevertheless, even at the current level of interest rates, the
ECB's monetary policy stance remained "on the accommodative
side", Trichet said. And the bank would "act in a firmly and
timely manner" to safeguard price stability in the euro area, he
promised.
