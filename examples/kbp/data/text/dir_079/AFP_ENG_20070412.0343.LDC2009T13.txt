Moroccan police set up road blocks and barricades Thursday around
the Casablanca district in bid to find accomplices of three
suicide bombers who blew themselves up this week.


Two men were arrested, including one who entered a house and
threatened to blow himself up if he was not given food, a police
source said.


Residents were jittery, with some chasing one of the suspects
detained Thursday, but many left the el Farah district and most
shops staying closed.


Interior Minister Chakib Benmoussa said Wednesday that security
forces were hunting three or four "dangerous" elements following
the suicide bomb deaths 24 hours earlier.


The police source said one of the two detained men "was arrested
after he went into a house and threatened its occupants that he
would blow himself up if they did not give him something to eat."


"However he was not carrying explosives and was overcome by
security services who proceeded to question him."


Police also confirmed that another suspect had been detained but
gave no details.


Residents told how they had surrounded one of the suspects.


"We saw the young man trying to clandestinely leave the
district," said Ahmed Choukhani, one of the chasers.


"We went after him and detained him before handing him over to
police. He looked thin and tired like someone who had been
hiding," added the witness.


The three suspected militants who blew themselves on Tuesday were
wanted in connection with a March 11 bombing at a Casablanca
Internet cafe staged by another suspected militant.
