The Democratic Republic of Congo's state prosecutor announced
Thursday that it had requested that former vice president Jean-
Pierre Bemba's parliamentary immunity be lifted.


Tshimanga Mukeba wrote to the senate on Tuesday asking that
Bemba's immunity be lifted, he said.


He currently enjoys parliamentary immunity by virtue of his seat
in the senate, which can only be lifted by parliament.


Government forces defeated Bemba's personal militia in bloody
streetfighting in Kinshasa last month after they had resisted
moves to integrate them into the army.


Bemba took refuge in the South African embassy and the government
issued an arrest warrant against him on charges of treason and
maintaining a militia.


Bemba, also a former rebel leader and failed presidential
candidate, flew into Portugal on Wednesday, ostensibly for
medical treatment.


Prosecutors have also opened an investigation into the clashes,
which diplomats say killed at least 200 people.


Bemba has been authorised to leave DRC for a period of 60 days
and still hold on to his senate seat. Mandates are automatically
terminated if a senator misses more than a quarter of the
sittings in a session without permission.
