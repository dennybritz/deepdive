Thailand on Thursday deported a Swiss man after he was given a
royal pardon from a 10-year prison sentence for defacing pictures
of the nation's revered king, a senior Swiss embassy official and
a Thai immigration official said.


Oliver Jufer, 57, was escorted onto a Swissair plane bound for
Zurich, which departed Bangkok at 23:15 pm (1615 GMT), said a
Thai immigration official who declined to be named. The plane is
expected to arrive in Zurich early Friday.


The official said a Thai nurse accompanied Jufer on his trip to
Switzerland. The senior Swiss embassy official, who met Jufer
earlier in the day in Bangkok, said the man was in good
condition.


"I talked to him, and he is in good health. Also we had very good
cooperation with Thai authorities," said the embassy official who
declined to be named.


Jufer was sentenced just two weeks ago after pleading guilty to
lese majeste -- offending the dignity of 79-year-old King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch.


The king is widely revered by Thais and protected by strict laws
against even the slightest insult.


Security cameras videotaped Jufer spraying black paint on the
monarch's portraits during a drunken spree in the northern city
of Chiang Mai on December 5, the king's birthday and a time of
national celebration.


He had been in jail since then.


But Jufer, a longtime Thai resident, received a royal pardon a
few days ago, said Panu Kwanyuen, the provincial attorney general
in Chiang Mai.
