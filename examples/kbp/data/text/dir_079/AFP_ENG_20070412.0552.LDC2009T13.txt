US Internet giant Google is poised to open a new operations
centre in the southwestern Polish city of Wroclaw, a Polish
newspaper reported Thursday, quoting a company official.


Google had already launched a recruitment drive for the new
centre, the company's European sales chief Colm Long told the
Gazeta Wyborcza daily.


Wroclaw, which has become Poland's high-tech hotspot, will be
Google's second largest European outpost after Dublin, where the
company has its continental hub.


It will handle client relations for Google's AdWards advertising
system, and will initially employ 50-100 people, Long said.


Wroclaw's local authorities have successfully attracted a string
of high tech multinationals to the city.


It has played on its proximity to other major markets, Poland's
thriving academic sector, which churns out highly-educated staff,
and lower wages and running costs than in many other European
countries.


It is already has attracted companies such as Hewlett-Packard,
LG-Philips and 3M.


Google, best known for its widely-used Internet search engine,
already has a research and development centre in Krakow, in
southern Poland.
