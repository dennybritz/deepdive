The Arab League strongly condemned the deadly suicide attack
inside Iraq's parliament building on Thursday and urged the Iraqi
people to work together against violence.


"Secretary General Amr Mussa strongly condemns the terrorist
explosion which took place today in the Iraqi parliament, ending
the lives of a number of deputies and innocent employees and
injuring others," the Cairo-based organisation said in a
statement.


It called on the Iraqi people to close ranks and work together
against violence and sectarianism and to restore stability.


At least three people were killed when a suicide bomber wearing
an explosives vest and carrying a briefcase blew himself up in
the cafeteria of the parliament building.


A security official told AFP that two of the dead were lawmakers
and the third a parliamentary employee, although Iraqi state
television said all three were MPs.


The Arab League has been trying to organise a national
reconciliation conference following up on a similar meeting held
in Cairo in November 2005 but it has been continuously delayed.
