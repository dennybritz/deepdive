The Oscar-winning acting talents of Denzel Washington and Forest
Whitaker are to join forces for the first time in a drama about a
collegiate debating team, reports said Thursday.


Washington, a best actor Oscar winner for "Training Day" in 2002,
will star in and direct "The Great Debaters," which is loosely
based on a true story, entertainment industry reports said.


The film tells the story of a group of students from a small
college in Texas who are turned into an elite debating team by an
inspirational teacher, rising to challenge Harvard's championship
squad in the 1930s.


Washington is to the play the debate team coach while Whitaker
will play the father of one of the students, who finds himself
competing for the loyalty of his son with the character played by
Washington.


Whitaker, who won an Oscar this year for his performance as
despotic Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in "The Last King of
Scotland," is currently filming the Los Angeles drama "Winged
Creatures."


Washington has recently completed the Ridley Scott crime thriller
"American Gangster," also starring Russell Crowe, which will be
released later this year.


Washington and Whitaker are two of only four black actors to have
won the best actor award at the Oscars, along with Jamie Foxx
(Ray) and Sidney Poitier (Lilies of the Field).
