Britain's deficit in trade in goods expanded to 6.8 billion
pounds (10.0 billion euros, 13.4 billion dollars) in February
mainly owing to a deterioration in trade with non-EU countries,
official data showed on Thursday.


The January figure was revised higher to 6.4 billion pounds from
an initial estimate of 6.2 billion, the Office for National
Statistics said.


Analysts had forecast a deficit of 6.4 billion pounds in
February.


Exports dipped to 18.4 billion pounds in February from January,
while imports rose to 25.2 billion. Sterling showed little
reaction to the data.


"We have become accustomed to widening trade gaps so that
sterling remains somewhat blase to such reports," said Jodie
Saul, economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.


Britain's trade with non-EU countries worsened to 4.1 billion
pounds in February, from 3.8 billion in January.


The trade deficit with the 27 EU countries expanded to 2.7
billion pounds from 2.6 billion.


Investec analyst David Page said the numbers were "disappointing"
and went against recent indications that British exports were
holding up well.
