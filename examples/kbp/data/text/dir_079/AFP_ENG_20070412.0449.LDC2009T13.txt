US President George W. Bush on Thursday strongly condemned a
deadly suicide bombing inside Iraq's parliament complex and
assured the fledgling government in Baghdad: "We stand with you."


"I strongly condemn the action. It reminds us, though, that there
is an enemy willing to bomb innocent people and a symbol of
democracy," Bush told reporters after an Iraqi official said two
lawmakers were among the dead.
