Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels Thursday shot dead seven villagers
of the majority Sinhalese community in northern Sri Lanka on the
eve of the traditional New Year, police said.


Gunmen from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) raided
the village of Avarantalawa in the district of Vavuniya where
heavy fighting raged between troops and Tamil Tigers, police
said.


Six women and a man were shot dead by the gunmen who escaped
before constables reached the area, a police official said from
Vavuniya, 260 kilometres (162 miles) north of here.


The attack came ahead of Saturday's traditional New Year shared
by the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamil communities. The
attack came despite stepped-up security ahead of the New Year to
guard against rebel attacks.


Police said Thursday's victims had been driven out of their homes
24 years ago and had returned in 2002 following a truce between
troops and Tamil Tigers.


However, the ceasefire is now observed only on paper with more
than 4,000 people killed in escalating violence since December
2005.


On Saturday, a roadside bomb attack killed eight people and
wounded 25 in the troubled Vavuniya district. The military blamed
the Tigers who denied the allegation and in turn said the
security forces were responsible.
