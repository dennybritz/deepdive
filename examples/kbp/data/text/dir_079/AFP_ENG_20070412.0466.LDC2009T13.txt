Two NATO soldiers were killed Thursday in separate explosions in
Afghanistan, taking the number of foreign soldiers killed in the
country to 11 in less than a week, the International Security
Assistance Force said.


Another soldier was wounded in the two blasts, which occurred 30
minutes apart along the same road in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF
said in a statement, without giving any further details.


"The two ISAF convoys were approximately eight kilometers apart,
conducting independent operations in support of the Afghan
government, when they were attacked within 30 minutes of each
other," it said.


American soldiers are deployed in eastern Afghanistan, a volatile
area that borders Pakistan.


Eight Canadian and one American soldiers have died in similar
explosions in Afghanistan since Sunday.


On April 8, Easter Sunday, Canada suffered its heaviest single-
day troop loss in 50 years with the death of six soldiers outside
Kandahar.


Since the beginning of the year, 39 NATO and US-led coalition
troops have died in Afghanistan. Some 170 were killed there in
2006.
