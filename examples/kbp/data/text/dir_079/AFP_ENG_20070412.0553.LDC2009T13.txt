Pakistani police Thursday arrested 200 opposition supporters
ahead of protests against the removal of the country's top judge
by President Pervez Musharraf, officials said.


The arrests were made in the capital Islamabad, the neighbouring
garrison city of Rawalpindi and throughout Punjab province, a
senior government official told AFP.


"Over 200 people have been detained. The detentions have been
made to prevent potential troublemakers from coming on to the
streets and creating law and order problems," the official said
on condition of anonymity.


He did not say which parties the arrested people belonged to.


The Pakistan People's Party of exiled former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistan Muslim League of Nawaz Sharif,
another ex-premier, and an alliance of hardline religious-
political parties have all called protests for Friday.


Lawyers are also planning to rally in support of Chief Justice
Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who was abruptly dismissed on March 9
by military ruler Musharraf.


They all plan to gather outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad
where Chaudhry is due to appear before a judicial panel hearing
the misconduct allegations that led to his suspension.


The judge's dismissal has led to a series of protests, many of
which have coincided with the judge's three previous appearances
at the court, including a rally of some 2,000 people last Friday.


Violent demonstrations on March 16 in Islamabad saw police firing
rubber bullets at stone-throwing protesters, while later protests
have been more peaceful.
