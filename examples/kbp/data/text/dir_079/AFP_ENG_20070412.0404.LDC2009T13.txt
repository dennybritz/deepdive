Shares in Franco-Italian semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics
rose sharply in afternoon trade, following a report it has formed
a joint venture with the US group Intel in the flash memory
sector, dealers said.


In mid afternoon trade STMicro stock was up 2.79 percent at 15.10
euros on an overall Paris market which dropped 0.62 percent.


"There are rumours about STMicro spinning off its flash
business," one Paris dealer said, noting that this was a long-
running story that comes back regularly.


EE Times Asia, an electronic engineering news website, cited Doug
Freedman, an analyst with American Technology Research, as saying
Intel and STMicroelectronics have created a joint venture
structure that is scheduled to start production in 2008.


No one at STMicroelectronics, a leading maker of semiconductors,
was immediately available to comment.


STMicro announced last October that it planned to spin off its
flash memory activities into a joint venture with another
operator.
