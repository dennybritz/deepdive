UN Secretary General Ki-moon on Thursday called for the release
of BBC correspondent Alan Johnston, kidnapped in the Gaza strip
one month ago, and promised to do what he could to obtain his
freedom.


"I'm deeply concerned that, even after one month of his abduction
he has not been released," Ban told reporters.


"Freedom of the press should be protected as a matter of
principle. I sincerely hope that those who are responsible for
this abduction should release him unconditionally and
immediately.


"I will do whatever I can in my capacity as Secretary-General" to
get Johnston's freedom, he said, offering sympathy for Johnston's
family.


Speaking in the West Bank city of Ramallah, BBC director general
Mark Thompson said he had been assured by Palestinian president
Mahmud Abbas that Johnston was "safe and well."


There has been no word on the fate of Johnston, 44, since he
kidnapped on March 12 -- the longest a Westerner has been held in
Gaza.


Johnston is one of the few Western reporters to be permanently
based in the lawless coastal strip.
