Nearly 500 refugees were Thursday repatriated to the Democratic
Republic of Congo's southeastern Katanga province from Tanzania,
the United Nations refugee agency said.


"The 494 refugees representing 133 families arrived by boat from
Kalemie in Tanzania," UNHCR spokesman Jens Hesemann told AFP.


"They are currently in a transit centre and will be sent to their
place of origin later," he said.


Tanzania houses the largest number of Congolese refugees with
some 120,000 living in camps.


The DRC was the centre of a brutal five-year-long war from 1998.
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed and at its height,
the conflict in the former Zaire drew in seven foreign armies.
