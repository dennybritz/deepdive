A German Tornado military jet crashed Thursday in Switzerland,
the German defence ministry said.


It was not immediately clear if there whether there were
casualties.


Swiss defence ministry spokesman Martin Buehler said the jet was
believed to have been coming from Corsica and bound for Germany
after refuelling at Emmen, a Swiss military base.


He said that one of the two pilots on board was thought to have
ejected before the crash in the Interlaken region in the Swiss
Alps.
