Two NATO soldiers were killed Thursday in separate explosions in
Afghanistan, taking the number of foreign soldiers killed in the
country to 11 in less than a week, the International Security
Assistance Force said.


Another soldier was wounded in the two blasts, which occurred 30
minutes apart along the same road in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF
said in a statement, without giving any further details.
