Azerbaijani authorities on Thursday said they had arrested 11
alleged Islamic extremists suspected of having ties to separatist
rebels in Russia's war-ravaged Chechnyan province.


The men were detained by special forces Monday in a raid on a
home in the village of Saray, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of
the capital Baku, interior ministry spokesman Sadig Gozalov told
AFP.


"The citizens are all known followers of Wahhabism and were
already facing convictions," he said, using a term often used in
the former Soviet Union as synonymous with Islamic extremism.


He said the men had trained with Chechen rebel warlord Ruslan
Gelayev in 2000-2002 in the Pankisi Gorge on the border between
Chechnya and Azerbaijan's neighbour Georgia.


Scores of people have been convicted in the mainly Muslim ex-
Soviet republic of Azerbaijan in recent years for involvement in
Chechnya's armed conflict.


Chechnya continues to be rocked by instability despite claims by
Russian authorities that they have normalized the situation after
years of separatist conflict dating back to the early 1990s.
