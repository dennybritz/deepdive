A senior US lawmaker said Thursday he would try to overturn a US
ban on online gambling, describing the law as "one of the
stupidest things" he ever saw.


Democrat Congressman Barney Frank, who chairs the House of
Representatives financial services committee, said that he would
introduce a bill in the coming weeks to change the law.


"I thought the online gambling bill we adopted was ... one of the
stupidest things I ever saw and I want to get it undone, I plan
to file legislation," he told reporters during a visit to
Brussels.


Last October, US President George W. Bush followed up earlier
legal changes by signing new legislation that effectively put a
stranglehold on all Internet gambling by outlawing the processing
of Internet bets by US banks.


Frank said that "if the storm of public unhappiness is strong
enough, I will try to substantially revise that ban."


Experts say the vast majority of online gamblers in the United
States use some 2,000 websites that are largely located in
offshore centres like Antigua and Gibraltar.


Americans are the biggest gamblers in the world, accounting for
80 percent of an estimated 12 billion dollars generated by online
gaming.


Last month a World Trade Organisation panel said that the United
States had failed to comply with a previous ruling ordering it to
open up the multi-billion dollar cross-border internet gambling
industry.
