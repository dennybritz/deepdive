Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi pledged on Thursday to
introduce proposals for voting reform in the near future, to try
to tackle the country's notoriously unstable system of
government.


The minister for reforms Vannino Chiti said in a statement that
the proposals would be presented in the next few days.


Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi pushed through the
current electoral law just weeks before legislative elections in
April last year.


Under this system, voters do not choose candidates, but parties
on lists grouped into two broad coalitions under a proportional
system.


A majority prize is given to the coalition obtaining a plurality,
at the national level for the Chamber of Deputies but at regional
level for the Senate, which poses the risk of contradictory
results.


As a result, Prodi's coalition has a comfortable majority in the
lower house, but just a two-seat advantage in the Senate.


Italy's shaky electoral system has got through 61 governments
since World War II.
