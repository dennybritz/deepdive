Taliban extremists shaved the heads and moustaches of a troupe of
Pakistani singers, then clashed with a marriage party and took
six hostages, officials and witnesses said Thursday.


The Islamists intercepted the musicians overnight near the
conservative northwestern town of Lakki Marwat where the group
was due to perform at three weddings, local police said.


After beating the troupe and smashing up their instruments, the
militants then shaved the performers' heads and moustaches, a
witness said.


Early on Thursday the angry hosts of one wedding went after the
Taliban and a clash erupted in which two local residents were
wounded, police said.


The militants then took some six people hostage, whose
whereabouts are currently unknown, they said.


Lakki Marwat lies some 160 kilometres (100 miles) southwest of
Peshawar, near the lawless South Waziristan tribal district where
the Pakistan army has fought pitched battles against Al-Qaeda
linked militants.


Pro-Taliban militants have bombed music and video shops and
barred hair salons from shaving beards in a bid to impose strict
a Islamic code as in neighbouring Afghanistan during the
1996-2001 Taliban era.


The practice of shaving people's beards and hair is designed to
humiliate them and is often used as a punishment in the devoutly
Islamic tribal zones.
