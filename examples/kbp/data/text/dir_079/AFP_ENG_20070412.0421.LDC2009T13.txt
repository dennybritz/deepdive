"Four international teams were staying in one hotel - what
security arrangements were made for them? There should be an
investigation."


- Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq hitting out at the
security at the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston where Bob Woolmer was

"Had we won we'd be in the running for a semi-final place, but
our chances are slim now. It's very tough for us and we now hope
to finish at least sixth."


- Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar after the four-wicket defeat
to England.


"We have to improve our batting display when we play South Africa
because we know they are a good side and they're going to put us
under pressure."


- England skipper Michael Vaughan


"It's not a warm-up match. We have got to be at our top form. We
take this game as seriously as against any other side."


- Australia pace bowler Shaun Tait on Friday's match with Ireland


"Most of the the times we've gone wrong we've tried to change the
game."
