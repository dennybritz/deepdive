British Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday expressed solidarity
with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika a day after two
suicide bombings in Algiers killed 33 people.


In a statement released by his office at 10 Downing Street, Blair
said he was "shocked and saddened to hear about the dreadful
terrorist attacks" in the Algerian capital on Wednesday.


"Both our countries have been victims of terrorism," he said,
recalling that Bouteflika was in Britain when four British-born
Muslims blew themselves up and killed 52 London commuters on July
7, 2005, the first such attacks in Europe.


"We were grateful for your steadfast support then, and I offer
you the same support now.


"Yesterday's appalling attacks only underline the importance of
the UK and Algeria continuing to stand together against the
scourge of international terrorism," Blair said.


The bombings in Algiers, which followed suicide blasts in
neighbouring Morocco, were claimed by Al-Qaeda's branch in North
Africa, which published photographs of what it said were the
three bombers on the Internet.
