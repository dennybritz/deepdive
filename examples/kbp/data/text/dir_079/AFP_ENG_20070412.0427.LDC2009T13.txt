Germany's leading economic research institutes are increasingly
optimistic about the outlook for Europe's biggest economy this
year and next year, according to a report in the Financial Times
Deutschland released on Thursday.


In a pre-release of an article to appear in its Friday edition,
FT Deutschland said that the five of the six think-tanks were
pencilling 2.5-percent growth for the German economy both this
year and next year.


The six institutes -- Ifo in Munich, DIW in Berlin, HWWA in
Hamburg, IfW in Kiel, IWH in Halle and RWI in Essen -- publish
widely watched spring and autumn reports containing their growth
forecasts.


In their report last autumn, they had forecast growth of 1.4
percent for 2007.


The institutes are scheduled to publish their latest spring
report next week.


A great many experts are confident that Germany's current
economic boom is set to continue for the time being.


Economy Minister Michael Glos recently said that the government's
current 2007 forecast of 1.7 percent was set to rise to at least
2.0 percent.
