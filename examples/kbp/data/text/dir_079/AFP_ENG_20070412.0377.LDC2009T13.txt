An official report into an explosion last month which ripped
apart Mozambique's main armoury and killed 119 people has blamed
the tragedy on poor storage conditions, the presidency said
Thursday.


"The report says the causes of the explosion were the poor
storage of stocks of arms and explosives in the armoury and the
weather conditions," a spokesman in the office of President
Armando Guebuza told AFP.


"It points to human error as the main cause of the incident,"
Estefanio Muholove added.


Guebuza ordered the report the day after the blast on March 22,
close to the country's main international airport.


Apart from the 119 fatalities, around 500 others were injured
when the massive stockpile of weapons and explosives, which
included missiles and landmines, suddenly blew up.


Sources taking part in the rescue operation had said the weapons
and explosives had been packed into a building with a tin roof
and little ventilation as temperatures were in the mid-30s
celsius.


The defence minister confirmed on Wednesday that the armoury will
be rebuilt far from inhabited areas after criticism that it had
been sited so close to civilians.


Many of the explosives that went off in the blast were left over
from the southeast African country's civil war which ended in
1992.


The government has also announced that it will spend around 12
million dollars on rebuilding around 1,300 homes that were either
fully or partially destroyed by the blast.
