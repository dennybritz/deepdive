A remake of the cult 1960s science-fiction film "Barbarella" is
in the pipeline, entertainment industry reports said Thursday.


Legendary Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis has completed a
deal to secure rights for the remake of the camp 1968 film
starring a scantily-clad Jane Fonda in a series of intergalactic
adventures.


The film, based on the French comic-book creation of Jean-Claude
Forest, was a box-office flop on its release but has since
acquired cult status and influencing rock acts such as Duran
Duran and Prince.


Movie industry daily Variety said the film would re-invent
Barbarella's character from a "kittenish sex-pot into a free,
modern gal who survives in a futuristic world through
intelligence, fighting skills and sexuality."


De Laurentiis produced the original "Barbarella" and his credits
also include Fellini's "La Strada," 1973's "Serpico" and David
Lynch's "Blue Velvet."
