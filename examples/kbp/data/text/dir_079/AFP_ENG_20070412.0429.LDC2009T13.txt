First quarter growth in the 13-nation euro area should come to
0.5 percent, and the economy should expand by another 0.6 percent
in the second quarter, the statistical offices of France, Germany
and Italy said on Thursday.


The French institute Insee, and its German and Italian
counterparts Ifo and Isae added in a joint statement that the
eurozone economy should then grow by 0.6 percent more in the
third quarter of 2007.


The first-quarter figure was revised higher from a previous
estimate by all three national services in January of 0.3
percent.


"Industrial production is expected to stabilize at a reasonably
high level," the statement said to explain its optimistic
outlook.


In addition, the effect of an increase in value-added tax in
Germany "should have a weaker impact in eurozone consumption than
initially forecast."
