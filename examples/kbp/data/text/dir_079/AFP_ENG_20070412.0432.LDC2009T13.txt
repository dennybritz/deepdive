The European single currency surged past 1.35 dollars for the
first time since January 2005 in trading here Thursday after ECB
chief Jean-Claude Trichet signalled that eurozone rates will rise
in June.


European Central Bank President Trichet sent a clear signal that
the bank was set to raise its key interest rates -- already at a
five-and-a-half-year high -- still further in June.
