Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki condemned a suicide attack inside
Iraq's parliament building on Thursday as a "criminal and
cowardly act" and vowed such violence would not weaken MPs'
resolve.


"We strongly condemn this criminal and cowardly attack, and this
mean act will not weaken the will of the representatives of the
Iraqi people," Maliki said in a statement issued by his office.


The prime minister is currently in Seoul where he called on
international bodies to help rebuild his war-torn country.


"Terrorist gangs committed a henious crime resulting in the
martyrdom and injuries of some deputies," the statement from his
office said.


"This crime confirms that the terrorists are targeting people
through their representatives and they want to abort the
democratic experience and hinder the political process" of Iraq.


At least three people were killed when a suicide bomber wearing
an explosives vest and carrying a briefcase blew himself up in
the cafeteria of the parliament building.


A security official told AFP two of the dead were lawmakers and
the third a parliamentary employee, although state television
said all three were MPs.
