Iraq's parliament will hold an extraordinary session on Friday to
condemn "terrorism" following a suicide bombing that killed three
people including at least two MPs, the speaker said.


"The parliament will hold a session tomorrow as a challenge to
terrorism," Sunni speaker Mahmud Mashhadani told state television
Al-Iraqiya after Thursday's attack.


Two lawmakers and a parliamentary employee were killed when a
suicide bomber wearing an explosives belt and carrying a
briefcase blew himself up amid a group of lawmakers in the
canteen of the parliament building.


One of the dead MPs was from a Sunni parliamentary bloc, as were
five wounded lawmakers.
