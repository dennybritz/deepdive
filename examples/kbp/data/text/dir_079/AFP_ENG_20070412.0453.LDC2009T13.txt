An Ohio man has been accused of helping to train fellow Al-Qaeda
agents to carry out bombings in Europe and the United States, US
officials said Thursday.


Christopher Paul, 43, was indicted on charges of providing
material support to terrorists and conspiring to use weapons of
mass destruction.


Paul stored a large stock of items that could be used in a
terrorist attack, including a laser range finder, night vision
scope, books and literature on explosives, remote control items,
and other survival gear, at several homes in Columbus, the
indictment said.


He also began researching on commercial flight simulator programs
as well as remote-controlled boats and helicopters in 2006,
prosecutors said.


The indictment said that the man born in Columbus, Ohio traveled
to Germany in 1999 to provide explosives training and help
recruit Al-Qaeda agents.


He is also accused of traveling to Pakistan and Afghanistan in
late 1990 or early 1991 to join Al-Qaeda in a "commitment to
violent jihad."
