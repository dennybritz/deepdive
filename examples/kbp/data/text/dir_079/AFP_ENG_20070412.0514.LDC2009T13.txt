Macedonia's interior minister Gordana Jankulovska has promised
that she would return a BMW that she drives to the football star
David Beckham if it turns out to be the one stolen from him, the
BBC reported Thursday.


Macedonia took possession of the car, valued at 75,000 pounds
(110,000 euros, 145,000 dollars) after judicial procedures
concluded it had been illegally imported and no-one had claimed
it.


Jankulovska said it was legal for her to drive the BMW X5
impounded by the Macedonian police after it was shipped from
Greece.


"This car changed a number of owners before and some of the
numbers were changed in an illegal way," Jankulovska was quoted
as saying on the BBC website.


"If no owner claims the property, the car can be auctioned or
kept for state use," Jankulovska said.


It is the same model but a different colour from Beckham's
vehicle, which disappeared last year in Madrid.


"It is impossible to have a final confirmation that this is the
car," said Jankulovska.


The BBC said Macedonian press reports linked his car to the
minister, despite the difference in colour.


She told B92 radio in Belgrade that she was a fan of Beckham and
would like to meet him if it turned out that the car belonged to
him.


Beckham is leaving Real Madrid to the Los Angeles Galaxy for a
package worth a total of 250 million dollars, but the former
England captain will not join his new team until sometime after
his contract with Real runs out in June.
