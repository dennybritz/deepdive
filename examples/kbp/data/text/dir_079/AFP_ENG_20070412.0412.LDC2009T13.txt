Two major refugee organisations on Thursday urged the European
Union to open its doors to up to 20,000 Iraqis to ease the
pressure on the conflict-ridden nation's neighbours.


The European Council of Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) and Germany's
Pro Asyl said the EU should play a bigger role in easing the
plight of the 50,000 people who flee Iraq every month.


They also urged them to help the country's estimated two million
internally displaced persons.


"We face a growing humanitarian crisis," Richard Williams, the
ECRE's EU representative, told reporters.


"Europe has a particular responsibility because certain EU member
nations formed part of the coalition" to oust Saddam Hussein, he
added.


Williams said the practice of returning Iraqi refugees to their
home country as soon as possible was "deeply shameful" and all EU
27 member countries should ban it.


ECRE and Pro Asyl said Germany had a duty as EU president to make
the bloc adopt a more humane policy towards Iraqi refugees, but
accused the country of setting a poor example by taking in only
189 Iraqis in 2006.


Their call comes ahead of next week's two-day conference in
Geneva organised by the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, which
hopes to find homes for 20,000 Iraqi refugees this year.


The UNHCR meeting runs April 17 to 18. The issue of Iraqi
refugees is also expected to be on the agenda when EU justice and
interior ministers meet in Luxembourg next week.
