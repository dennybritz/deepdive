EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini   said here Thursday that
concrete results were needed despite some good signs in the
process of Croatia's justice reform.


"We have to accompany very important implementation of
legislative reforms with concrete implementation of the
investigations of petty corruption and high-level cases of
corruption," he said after attending a government session.


"I would need figures, data...there was an increase of cases of
corruption brought before courts last year. That's already a very
good message," he added.


Justice Minister Ana Lovrin said earlier that Croatia had cut the
number of backlog cases by 30 percent last year to about a
million, while the number of reported corruption cases in 2006
increased by 120 percent.


Reform of the judiciary is one of the key conditons set by
Brussels for Croatia which opened membership talks with the EU in
2005.


The Balkans country hopes to join the 27-member bloc by the end
of the decade.
