Eight members of a 14-strong crew have been rescued after a
Norwegian oil rig support vessel capsized off the Shetland Isles,
off the north-west Scottish coast, the coastguard said Thursday.


The ship capsized about 75 nautical miles (139 kilometres) west
of the north Shetlands near the Transocean Rather oil platform at
about 5:00 pm (1600 GMT), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency
said.


"There were 14 people on board. Eight people have been recovered
... There are other vessels in the vicinity assisting. Our
coastguard rescue helicopter is also on scene," MCA spokeswoman
Sophie Turner told AFP.


Michael Mulford, from the Royal Air Force base at Kinloss,
northeast Scotland, told Sky News television an RAF Nimrod plane
and a specialist North Sea rescue helicopter had been sent to the
scene.


"One moment that vessel would have been alongside a rig and for
some reason... she has capsized. That creates an immediate
emergency situation 100 miles away from the nearest island," he
said.


"That in itself is serious but... I'm encouraged that eight have
been rescued so far."


Neither Mulford nor Turner had details about the condition of the
eight, nor weather conditions in the area at the time.
