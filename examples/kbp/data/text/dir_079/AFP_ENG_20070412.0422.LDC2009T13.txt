The suicide bomber who blew himself up inside Iraq's parliament
building was probably the bodyguard of a lawmaker, a senior
security official at the national assembly said on Thursday.


"There is a strong indication that the suicide bomber was a
bodyguard of one of the lawmakers," the official told AFP on
condition of anonymity.


He said three lawmakers, for example, are known to regularly
refuse security checks inside the heavily guarded Green Zone
where parliament sits.


The official said police were also questioning the manager of the
cafeteria, who was new on the job after being hired last month,
as well as kitchen staff working at the cafe.


Two MPs and a parliamentary employee were killed in the bomb
attack a few minutes after lunchtime in the canteen of the
building.


On March 23, Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi was wounded in
a two-bomb assassination attempt outside his Baghdad home, after
which members of his private security team were detained on
suspicion of being behind the attack.
