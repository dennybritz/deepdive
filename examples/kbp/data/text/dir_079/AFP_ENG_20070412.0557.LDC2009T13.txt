South African President Thabo Mbeki said Thursday after meeting
Jacques Chirac here that he was pleased by the outgoing French
president's continuing commitment to be of service to Africa.


"Because even after he leaves office, he still has... a lot of
wisdom and experience and authority," he told reporters, noting
"the great attachment that President Chirac has toward the
African continent."


Mbeki, who arrived in Paris after a trip to Sudan, also said
Chirac had played "a very important role" in promoting the
African development programme known by its acronymn NEPAD.


The two presidents had a meeting followed by a lunch at the
Elysee presidential palace.


Chirac, whose term in office comes to an end next month, for his
part said he was "touched by this visit in which he saw a gesture
of friendship from a major African country with which France
wants to develop its relations," according to the president's
spokesman.
