The White House on Thursday condemned a deadly suicide bombing
inside Iraq's parliament complex but insisted that the attack did
not call into question the US-led crackdown in Baghdad.


"The United States condemns this attack on the democratically
elected government of Iraq," national security spokesman Gordon
Johndroe said after the bombing left three people dead, including
two Iraqi lawmakers.
