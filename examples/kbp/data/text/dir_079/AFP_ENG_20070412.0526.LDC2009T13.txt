AC Milan are facing a 100,000 euro fine after their players wore
shirts with a logo of a gambling firm in Wednesday's Champions
League quarter-final against Bayern Munich.


Advertising for gambling is illegal in Bavaria and the Italians
are set to be punished for their lapse, the Bavarian authorities
announced on Thursday.


AC Milan won the last eight second leg tie 2-0 to go through to
the Champions League semi-finals where they face Manchester
United.
