A US military spokesman in Iraq on Thursday said Al-Qaeda was one
of the networks that could have had an interest in staging a
deadly attack on Iraq's parliament building.


"Al-Qaeda is one of the organisations that would want to do
that," Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver told CNN television
in an interview.


"That would want to separate the population from the government,
that would want the government to fail, that wants the security
plan to fail in Baghdad."


Asked if he thought the most probable claim of responsibility
would come from Al-Qaeda, Garver replied: "We will wait and see
what the investigation identifies.


"Obviously the people who did this did not have the best
interests of the Iraqi people in mind... These are people who are
killing innocent civilians in order to try and make a point, in
order to try and discredit the government."


Earlier US military commander Major General William Caldwell said
that eight Iraqis were killed and 23 wounded in the blast inside
the parliament building.


An Iraqi security official said two of the wounded were
lawmakers.
