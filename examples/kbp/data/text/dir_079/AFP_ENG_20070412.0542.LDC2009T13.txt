A right-wing extremist who was deported from Canada to face trial
in Germany for spreading racist propaganda over the Internet was
denied an audience with Canada's top justices Thursday.


The Supreme Court of Canada rejected Ernst Zundel's appeal that
he was unlawfully detained and deported from Canada in 2005,
after being ruled a threat to national security because of his
links to white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.


Zundel, 67, had sought 10 million Canadian dollars (8.8 million
US) in damages.


In February, a German court convicted Zundel on 14 counts of
incitement of racial hatred, causing offence, and disturbing the
peace of the dead by publishing and distributing anti-Semitic and
neo-Nazi materials.


He was sentenced to five years in prison -- the maximum sentence
allowed under German law for denying the Holocaust.


Zundel authored "The Hitler We Loved and Why" and helped
disseminate several books denying the Holocaust, the systematic
murder of some six million Jews by the Nazis during World War II.


He was arrested on an international warrant issued in 2003 and
was held in Canada for two years while he fought extradition.


Zundel had lived in Canada from 1958.
