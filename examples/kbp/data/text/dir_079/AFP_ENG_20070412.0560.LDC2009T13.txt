Oscar-winning British actress Rachel Weisz has pulled out of
negotiations to star in the third instalment of the successful
"Mummy" adventure films, reports said Thursday.


Weisz, who won a best-supporting actress Oscar last year for her
performance in "The Constant Gardner," appeared in the first two
"Mummy" films, which have grossed 830 million dollars worldwide
since 1999.


However the hero of the previous films, Brendan Fraser, has
agreed a deal to appear in "The Mummy 3", which is due for
release in mid-2008, according to movie industry daily Variety.


Recent reports have said Chinese action hero Jet Li will play the
mummified monster in the new film as the plot moves to China.


Although plot details are being kept secret, the film would begin
in ancient times before switching to a post World-War II setting.
