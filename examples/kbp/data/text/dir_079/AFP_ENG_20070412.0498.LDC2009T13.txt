The German construction giant Hochtief has been cleared to buy
Budapest Airport from British airport operator BAA, the Hungarian
State Privatisation Agency APV said Thursday.


"The board of directors of APV today approved the emission of the
letter of agreement in the matter of the planned change of
ownership of Budapest Airport shares," APV said in a statement.


In October, a consortium comprising Hochtief AirPort, Caisse de
depot et placement du Quebec and the German state-owned bank KfW
had signed a memorandum of understanding to buy BAA's stake in
Budapest Airport of 75 percent minus one share.


BAA acquired the stake for around 1.9 billion euros (2.4 billion
dollars) in December 2005 but decided to sell the holding
following a change of strategy that accompanied BAA's acquisition
by the Spanish group Ferrovial last year.
