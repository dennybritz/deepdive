International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo Rato expressed
confidence Thursday in the World Bank's ability to resolve a
nepotism controversy swirling around its president, Paul
Wolfowitz.


"I have total confidence in the institution," Rato told reporters
when asked about the path ahead in the damaging row that has
engulfed the IMF's sister organization.


Wolfowitz is accused of favoritism over hefty pay rises given to
his girlfriend at the development lender.


Earlier Thursday the former deputy US defense secretary
apologized for a "mistake" over the employment terms of Libyan-
born Shaha Riza, but refused to say if he might quit as the World
Bank board met to debate the matter.
