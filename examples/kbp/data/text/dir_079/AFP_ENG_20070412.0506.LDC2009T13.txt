An Italian priest was sentenced Thursday to three and a half
years in jail for possessing cocaine with the intention of
selling it, the ANSA news agency reported.


Father Stefano Ciacca, 44, was arrested last September in
possession of half a kilogramme (about a pound) of cocaine with a
street value of about half a million euros (675,000 dollars).


A police dog had detected the drug in a package mailed from South
America and addressed to a certain Don Ziliotti in Perugia.


After some sleuthing, police identified Ciacca, arrested him and
searched his home, where they found a small scale, substances to
cut with the cocaine and some marijuana, ANSA said.


The priest claimed to be unaware of the contents of the package,
which he said was given to him by someone he was helping "on a
spiritual path."


On Thursday, Judge Paolo Micheli sentenced both Ciacca and an
accomplice to three and a half years in jail.


ANSA said the two men had gone to Colombia last year and used
Ciacca's savings to buy the cocaine, which they mailed to Italy.
