A roadside bomb attack killed six Iraqi civilians taking the bus
home from college and work near the northern oil hub of Kirkuk on
Thursday, security and medical sources said.


Doctor Abdallah Mohammed Khorsheed said the bodies of six
civilians were brought into hospital after the makeshift bomb
exploded alongside the bus as it was headed to a neighbourhood
outside Kirkuk.


Another 21 Iraqis were wounded in the attack, the latest violence
increasingly rocking the troubled oil hub ahead of a referendum
on its future status which under the constitution should take
place by year-end.


A security official said the bus was carrying students and
workers home from their place of study and employment in downtown
Kirkuk.


Insurgent attacks are common in Kirkuk, which sits atop a third
of the country's oil resources and is home to a fractious ethnic
and sectarian mix.


Longstanding Kurdish demands for the city to be incorporated into
their autonomous region in northern Iraq -- strongly opposed by
Iraqi Arabs and neighbouring Turkey -- is the focus of this
year's expected referendum.
