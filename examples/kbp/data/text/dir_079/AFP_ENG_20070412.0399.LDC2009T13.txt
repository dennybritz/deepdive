Senegal warned Thursday it might pull its troops out of Sudan's
troubled Darfur region, where it has recently lost five soldiers,
unless the African Union (AU) guaranteed peacekeepers' security.


"If the AU is not adequately equipped to ensure the security of
the contingents deployed on the ground, the government of Senegal
may consider pulling out its troops," the West African country's
cabinet said in a statement.


Five of Senegal's more than 500 troops taking part in an African
peacekeeping force in Darfur were killed in an April 1 attack
which Dakar blamed on the rebel Sudan Liberation Army.


The attack was the worst to hit the embattled and under-funded AU
contingent since it was first deployed in the western Sudanese
region in 2004.


Senegal demanded an "exhaustive inquiry into the attack to
identify as soon as possible the perpetrators, arrest and punish
the authors of the fatal attack."


Sudan has come under growing international pressure to accept a
plan put forward by former UN chief Kofi Annan to beef up the AU
peacekeeping force in Darfur with UN forces.


But Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir has repeatedly rejected the
plan, accusing the West of harbouring neo-colonial ambitions.


Senegal deployed at least 500 troops in Darfur in 2005 as part of
the AU's 7,000-strong force deployed in the region.


The ill-equipped AU contingent has failed to stem the violence
and 16 of its troops have been killed there since 2004.


Four years of civil war in Darfur have killed at least 200,000
people and displaced more than two million, according to United
Nations figures.
