UN chief Ban Ki-moon said he was "deeply troubled" by Thursday's
deadly suicide bomb attack on Iraq's parliament complex and urged
Iraqi leaders to come together in a spirit of unity.


"I am again deeply troubled by all the continuing violence,
particularly this time the attack on the Iraqi Parliament," he
told reporters. "Such violence, whatever the motives may be,
cannot be justified, can never be justified."


In a statement released by his press office, the UN secretary
general urged "all Iraqi leaders to come together in a spirit of
unity in order to stem the violence and work toward a more
peaceful and stable Iraq."


A suicide bomber blew himself up at the Iraqi parliament in
Baghdad's Green Zone, killing eight people including at least two
MPs in a major breach of security at Iraq's most heavily guarded
site.


A US military commander said eight people were killed and 23
others wounded in the explosion at the parliament's canteen, but
gave no other details.


The bombing occurred despite a massive US-Iraqi security
crackdown launched in the capital two months ago.


The attack -- a rare strike inside the heavily-fortified Green
Zone -- came just hours after an attack on a Baghdad bridge that
left 10 people dead.
