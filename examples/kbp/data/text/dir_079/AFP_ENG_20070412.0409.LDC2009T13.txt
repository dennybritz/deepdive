World famous opera soprano Montserrat Caballe celebrated her
birthday on Thursday together with one of Vienna's most famous
culinary specialties, a Sachertorte.


The Catalan singer, who is currently performing at the Vienna
Opera House, was presented with the chocolate gateau at a
surprise birthday party at the Sacher Hotel.


It was here that the trademark for the "Original Sachertorte" was
first registered by the son of Franz Sacher, the man credited
with inventing the gateau in 1832.


"I love surprises and I love giving them, too," Caballe said as
she posed before the one meter (three feet) wide cake in one of
the sumptious rooms in the five star Sacher Hotel.


However, she was at pains to point out the difference in their
two ages. "This cake is 101 years older than I am," she said.


The Sachertorte is made of two layers of dense chocolate dough
with a thin layer of apricot jam in the middle and dark chocolate
icing with shreds of chocolate on the top and sides.


Its recipe has been a closely guarded secret since its invention.


Caballe is currently performing in Donizetti's "La Fille du
Regiment" (Daughter of the Regiment) alongside Natalie Dessay and
Juan Diego Flores.
