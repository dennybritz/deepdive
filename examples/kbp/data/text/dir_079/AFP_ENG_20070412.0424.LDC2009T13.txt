The Hungarian parliament barred a Jewish lawmaker on Thursday
from saying a Jewish prayer during a session of parliament to
mark Holocaust remembrance day next week.


Tamas Suchman, a member of the ruling Socialist party, said he
wanted to say the Kaddish in parliament because this was where
the first anti-Jewish laws in Europe were passed in the inter-war
period.


But the parliament's rules committee said Thursday that while
Suchman -- who is Jewish -- could speak in parliament on
Holocaust remembrance day on Monday he would not be allowed to
say the Kaddish.


"It has not been customary to say prayers during the plenary so
the parliamentary groups decided not to create a precedent for
this," Speaker of Parliament Katalin Szili, a fellow Socialist
MP, told MTI national news agency.


The Kaddish forms part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all
prayer services as well as at funerals and memorialsis.


Suchman called the decision "disgraceful and humiliating."


The so-called numerus clausus, the first anti-Jewish law in 20th
Century Europe which limited the number of Jews that could attend
universities, was passed by the Hungarian legislature in 1920 at
a time of rising anti-semitism.


In a statement Suchman said the law had "laid the ground for the
deaths of 600,000 Hungarian Jews at the hands of Hungarian and
German fascist powers".
