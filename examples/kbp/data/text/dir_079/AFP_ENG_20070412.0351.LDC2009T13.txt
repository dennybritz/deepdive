Malaysia's ruling coalition Thursday won a key by-election in
western Malacca state, seen as a gauge of support for opposition
parties ahead of a possible early general election.


Lai Meng Chong from the Malaysian Chinese Association, part of
Malaysia's ruling coalition, won the tiny rural seat of Machap
with 5,533 votes, defeating his opponent by a margin of 4,081
votes, the state Bernama news agency reported.


Retaining the seat for the ruling National Front coalition, Lai
beat the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP)'s Liou Chen
Kuang, who won 1,452 votes.


The poll saw a 74.3 percent turnout from a total of 9,623
registered voters, according to data released by Bernama.


Analysts had said the DAP was not expected to win the by-
election, but were on the lookout for a reduced majority for the
ruling coalition as a sign of growing support for opposition
parties.


In the last state poll in 2004, the ruling National Front
coalition won Machap with 4,562 votes from a total of 5,847
voters, beating the DAP's Liou, who Thursday ran for the second
time.


Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak, who had been campaigning in
Machap, earlier hailed what he said was a peaceful election,
which was called after a ruling coalition state lawmaker died.


"Security is under control. There's no tension, just the normal
competition," Bernama quoted him as saying.


Malaysia must hold a general election by early 2009, but
opposition parties expect Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to
call a poll before then.
