Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Thursday denounced the
"vile terrorist attacks" in Algiers that killed at least 33
people and were claimed by Al- Qaeda's north African branch.


In a message of condolence to Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika, Prodi expressed "the strongest condemnation of these
horrible terrorist acts that can have no justification".


Prodi offered his support "to the Algerian people in the fight
against terrorism."
