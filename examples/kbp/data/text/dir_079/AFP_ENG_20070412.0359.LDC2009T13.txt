British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett condemned Thursday's
deadly blast inside the Iraqi parliament building as the product
of "twisted minds" seeking to disrupt the country's budding
democracy.


"I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear of this appalling
attack on the democratically elected members of the Iraqi
Parliament going about their day to day business," Beckett said.


"Nothing could highlight more the twisted minds of those who are
seeking to disrupt the democratic process in Iraq," Beckett said.


"Those who carry out these outrageous attacks offer nothing to
the Iraqi people except more murder and destruction. The Iraqi
people have shown great fortitude and courage -- they deserve our
full and continued support."


Her statement expressed sympathy for the families and friends of
the two lawmakers killed and 10 others hurt in what has been
described as a suicide bombing inside the parliament building
canteen.
