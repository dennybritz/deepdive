A deadly suicide bombing inside Iraq's parliament complex
Thursday was the work of "terrorists" trying to counter the new
US security effort in Baghdad, US Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said.


"It's obviously again the terrorists and those who wish to stop
the Iraqi people from having a future that would be based on
democracy and stability," Rice said after meeting with Senator
John McCain, a Republican presidential hopeful and strong
supporter of the administration's policy in Iraq.
