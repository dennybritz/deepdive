South Africa's controversial Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-
Msimang has been discharged from hospital after undergoing a
liver transplant, her ministry said on Thursday.


Tshabalala-Msimang was "recovering steadily" at her home in
Pretoria after the operation a month ago but would still require
regular hospital treatment as an out-patient.


Tshabalala-Msimang, 66, went on leave in October last year and
while she did briefly return to work in January, was later
readmitted to hospital.


Tshabalala-Msimang has been a major target of criticism both at
home and abroad over her approach to AIDS, earning the name of Dr
Beetroot for touting the use of vegetables to help combat the
disease.


Transport Minister Jeff Radebe has been acting health minister in
her absense.
