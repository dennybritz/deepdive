A Rome court on Thursday ruled that the football stadium in
Sicily where a police officer was killed during crowd violence
must continue to hold games behind closed doors, the ANSA news
agency reported.


The ruling, sought by the Italian Football Federation, overturned
an April 4 decision by a court in Catania.


After the violent February 2 clashes at the Sicilian derby
between Catania and Palermo, the Sicilian club was ordered to
hold its matches without fans until the end of the 2006-07
season.


But fans challenged the ruling, and a Catania tribunal on April 4
said they could return to the stadium.


About 50 Sicilian football fans and Catania Mayor Umberto
Scapagnini held a rally outside the Rome court to plead for their
right to attend matches, according to the website of the sporting
newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.
