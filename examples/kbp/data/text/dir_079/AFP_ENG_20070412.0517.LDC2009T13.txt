A German Tornado military jet on a training flight in the Swiss
Alps crashed into a mountain face on Thursday, the Swiss
authorities said.


At least one of the two German pilots survived the crash and was
retrieved by a mountain rescue team, police in the Swiss canton
of Bern said in a statement.


The rescue helicopter located the other crew member on a glacier
near the crash site near the village of Lauterbrunnen in central
Switzerland, but there was no news on his condition, it added.


Swiss Defence Ministry spokesman Martin Buehler said the fighter-
bomber had refuelled shortly beforehand at a Swiss airforce base
after flying in from Corsica.


Eyewitnesses told the Swiss news agency ATS that the jet had
flown low through a nearby valley before trying to climb. Police
said the jet reportedly exploded when it hit a mountain side.


At least one of the pilots on board ejected before the crash,
Buehler said.


The German Defence Ministry confirmed the crash.


Foreign military aircraft frequently take part in navigation
exercises in Swiss airspace.
