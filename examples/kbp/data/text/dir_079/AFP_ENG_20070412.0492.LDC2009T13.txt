Macedonia's interior minister Gordana Jankulovska promised to
return the BMW she is driving to football star David Beckham if
it is found to have been stolen from him, the BBC reported on
Thursday.


"This car changed a number of owners before and some of the
numbers were changed in an illegal way. It is impossible to have
a final confirmation that this is the car," Jankulovska was
quoted as saying on the BBC website.


Jankulovska said it is legal for her to drive a BMW X5 car
impounded by the Macedonian police after it was shipped from
Greece.


It is the same model but a different colour from Beckham's
vehicle, which disappeared last year in Madrid.


The BBC said Macedonian press reports linked his car to the
minister, despite the difference in colour.


Macedonia took possession of the car, valued at 75,000 pounds
(110,000 euros, 145,000 dollars) after judicial procedures
concluded it had been illegally imported and no-one had claimed
it.


"If no owner claims the property, the car can be auctioned or
kept for state use," Jankulovska said.


She told B92 radio in Belgrade that she was a fan of Beckham and
would like to meet him if it turned out that the car belonged to
him.


Beckham is leaving Real Madrid to join the Los Angeles Galaxy for
a package worth a total of 250 million dollars, but the former
England captain will not join his new team until sometime after
his contract with Real runs out in June.
