Scientists in Germany said Thursday they have found compelling
evidence of a genetic link to hyperactivity in children,
identifying three mutations prevalent in fidgety youngsters.


A research team led by Professor Johannes Hebebrand of the
University of Duisburg-Essen in western Germany studied 329
families in which one child had attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder syndrome.


They found that a great majority -- around 70 percent -- had a
combination of three mutations in the gene for the so-called
dopamine transporter linked to hyperactivity.


"People who have this combination in both copies of the gene have
a 2.5 increased ADHD risk. People with only one copy of this
variant still have almost twice the risk," Hebebrand said in a
statement.


"Of course, this doesn't mean that everyone who has the genetic
variants will automatically get the disease."


He noted that even healthy children can have such variations and
that it requires several gene mutations happening at once for
ADHD to result.


The study provides firmer genetic evidence for the role of the
dopamine transporter in hyperactivity than had been found to
date, Hebebrand said.


ADHD is the most common psychiatric disorder among children and
adolescents, with boys affected three or four times as often as
girls.
