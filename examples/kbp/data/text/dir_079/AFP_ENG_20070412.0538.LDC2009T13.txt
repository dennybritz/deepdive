A German airforce pilot was killed on Thursday when his Tornado
military jet crashed into a mountain face in the Swiss Alps, the
Swiss authorities said.


A rescue helicopter found the pilot on a glacier near the crash
site near the village of Lauterbrunnen in central Switzerland,
but he was later pronounced dead, a spokesman for police in the
canton of Bern said.


The other crew member was injured and was retrieved by a mountain
rescue team, the police said in a statement. Both pilots had
managed to eject before the crash.


Swiss Defence Ministry spokesman Martin Buehler said the German
fighter-bomber had refuelled shortly beforehand at a Swiss
airforce base after flying in from Corsica.


Eyewitnesses told the Swiss news agency ATS that the jet had
flown low through a nearby valley before trying to climb. Police
said the jet reportedly exploded when it hit a mountain side.


The German Defence Ministry confirmed the crash.


Foreign military aircraft frequently take part in navigation
exercises in Swiss airspace.
