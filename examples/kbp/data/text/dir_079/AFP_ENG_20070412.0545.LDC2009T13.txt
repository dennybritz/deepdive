Kyrgyzstan's opposition signalled an end late Thursday to a
political stand-off that brought thousands to the streets of this
unstable Central Asian state demanding the president's ouster.


"The president himself has taken a step toward us and is
beginning to initiate the process of a peaceful transfer of
power" by proposing constitutional changes curbing his power,
opposition leader Felix Kulov told journalists in the capital.


"We will therefore work through the deputies and wait for major
debates in parliament," said Kulov, who heads the United Front
for a Decent Future for Kyrgyzstan.


President Kurmanbek Bakiyev has faced opposition in parliament
and on the streets since he came to power in 2005 after a violent
uprising that drove out former veteran president Askar Akayev.


Turmoil has roiled this mountainous Central Asian state,
strategically located near Afghanistan and host to US and Russian
air bases, since the end of last year.


But Bakiyev made a series of concessions over the past week that
seemed to sap the energy of the United Front, which had
forcefully demanded Bakiyev's resignation in the run-up to
demonstrations it launched on Wednesday.


Kulov said the demonstrations that brought thousands to the
streets on Wednesday and Thursday would continue, but added: "The
number of protestors doesn't matter to us."


The opposition is still calling for early presidential elections
"but when it's realistic to hold those early elections is another
matter," Kulov said.
