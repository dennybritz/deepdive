US share indexes opened lower Thursday as investors remained
downbeat about Federal Reserve deliberations which suggested the
central bank is not poised to cut interest rates anytime soon.


The Fed minutes, dating from March but released Wednesday, said
that "further policy firming might prove necessary to foster
lower inflation," dashing hopes of a future rate cut.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 24.46 points (0.20
percent) at 12,460.16 several minutes after the opening bell was
rung.


The tech-rich Nasdaq composite fell 3.45 points (0.14 percent) to
2,455.86 while the Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index
lost 1.31 points (0.09 percent) to 1,437.56.


Shares had plunged sharply on Wednesday after the minutes were
released and also after the International Monetary Fund
downgraded its outlook for US economic growth, and traders said
the hangover appeared set to continue through Thursday.


Gerber, the biggest US baby food maker, was in focus after Swiss
food giant Nestle said it had agreed to buy Gerber for 5.5
billion dollars in a deal boosting its global footprint.
