Sandra Bullock will play a crossword fanatic who stalks a
television cameraman in a romantic comedy, entertainment industry
reports said Thursday.


The "Crash" and "Miss Congeniality" star will produce as well as
act in the film, to be titled "All About Steve," according to
movie industry journal The Hollywood Reporter.


The movie is about a crossword obsessive who becomes convinced
that a cameraman for cable network CNN is the love of her life on
the basis of a single date together.


Bullock's character then criss-crosses the country following the
cameraman to news hotspots, where she tries to convince him that
she is marriage material. The movie will begin filming later this
year and is to be directed by Phil Traill, reports said.
