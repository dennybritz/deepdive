The head of the UN atomic watchdog said on Thursday that the oil-
rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has the right to develop
nuclear energy for peaceful ends.


"It is a natural right for the GCC countries to possess nuclear
energy in order to use it for peaceful purposes," said the head
of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed
ElBaradei.


"There are some 150 countries which use nuclear energy," he told
a joint news conference in Riyadh with GCC chief Abdulrahman al-
Attiyah.


During their annual meeting in Riyadh last December, GCC heads of
state announced their determination to develop a joint nuclear
technology programme for peaceful use under international rules.


Their interest in developing atomic energy comes amid a
continuing standoff between the West and the GCC's neighbour Iran
over its programme to enrich uranium.


ElBaradei said he advised the GCC countries to begin by
constructing a plant for research purposes to train staff.


The six GCC countries are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
