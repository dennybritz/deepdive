South Africa's key lending rate is to remain unchanged at 9.0
percent despite upward inflationary pressure, central bank
governor Tito Mboweni announced on Thursday.


"The monetary policy committee has decided that despite the
slight deterioration in the inflation outlook, an unchanged
monetary policy stance continues to be appropriate for now,"
Mboweni told reporters.


"The repo rate will therefore remain at nine percent per annum,"
he added after a meeting of the committee in the capital
Pretoria.


Economists had been expecting the repo rate would remain the same
despite mounting oil prices, the effects of drought which have
driven up the price of basic foodstuffs and the impact of a weak
rand.
