The bodies of nearly 400 Afghan civilians killed during the
communist regime that ended in 1992 have been found in a mass
grave in northeastern Afghanistan, officials said Thursday.


The grave was found by local farmers in a desert just outside
Faizabad, the capital town of the remote Badakhshan province,
deputy governor Shams-ul Rahman Shams told AFP.


"We've so far recovered the bodies of some 380 people. They were
killed during the communist time," Shams said.


He said that most of the victims appeared to be civilians who had
been killed for opposing the Moscow-backed communist regime.


The discovery comes months after the Afghan parliament passed a
reconciliation law which grants amnesty to those behind the
decades of atrocities during the communist regime.


President Hamid Karzai also signed the law but with amendments
safeguarding the rights of individuals to seek justice for the
crimes against them.
