European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said Thursday
that the financial markets were not wrong in betting on a further
rise in eurozone interest rates in June.


Asked at a news conference whether market expectations for a June
rate rise were correct, Trichet said he "will not contradict" any
such expectations.


Nevertheless, the Frenchman insisted that the ECB had not "pre-
committed" to any pre-set timetable of interest rate moves.


The bank, known as the guardian of the euro, held its benchmark
"refi" refinancing rate steady at 3.75 percent at its regular
monthly policy-setting meeting on Thursday, just a month after
raising them by a quarter of a percentage point to their highest
level in five and a half years.
