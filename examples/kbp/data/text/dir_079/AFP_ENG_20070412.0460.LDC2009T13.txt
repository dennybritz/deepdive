Eight people were killed and another 23 people wounded in an
explosion at the Iraqi parliament building on Thursday, a top US
military commander said.


"Our reporting right now indicates eight killed and 23 injured,"
Major General William Caldwell told reporters in a statement read
out to AFP over the telephone by a military official, giving no
further details.


An Iraqi security official told AFP earlier that at least two
Iraqi lawmakers and a parliamentary official had been killed when
a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt walked into the
building's canteen with a suitcase.
