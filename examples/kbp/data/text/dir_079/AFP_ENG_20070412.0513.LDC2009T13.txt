Six leading trading groups said Thursday they would work to
conclude fragile global trade talks by the end of this year,
following a two-day meeting in the Indian capital.


Ministers from the United States, the European Union, Brazil,
India, Japan and Australia held two days of meetings in New Delhi
to salvage the Doha talks, billed as a once-in-a-generation
chance to lower trade barriers and bring millions out of poverty.


"We believe that by intensifying our work we can reach
convergence and thus contribute to concluding the round by the
end of 2007," said the six nations in a statement issued after
the second and final day of talks Thursday.


"The meeting in New Delhi inaugurates a new phase of our
discussions."


The countries -- the "G-6" -- said they would work "with the
entire WTO membership in the best interests of completing the
round in the time envisaged."
