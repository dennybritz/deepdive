The European single currency surged past 1.35 dollars for the
first time since January 2005 in trading here Thursday after ECB
chief Jean-Claude Trichet signalled that eurozone rates will
likely rise in June.


The euro hit 1.3503 dollars at about 1440 GMT, a level last seen
on January 3, 2005.


"Trichet said nothing much new and most investors were already
expecting a hike to rates in June, but his confirmation served as
an excuse" to buy the euro, CIBC economist Audrey Childe-Freeman
said.


European Central Bank President Trichet on Thursday sent a clear
signal that the bank was ready to raise its key interest rates --
already at a five-and-a-half- year high -- still further in June.


While the ECB, known as the guardian of the euro, held its
benchmark "refi" refinancing rate steady at 3.75 percent on
Thursday and signalled a continuation of the status quo again
next month, the financial markets were not wrong in betting on a
rise in eurozone borrowing costs in June, Trichet said.


Asked at a news conference whether market expectations for a June
rate rise were correct, Trichet said: "I would not say anything
today aimed at changing the expectations for a month or two."
