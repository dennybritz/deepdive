Indonesian prosecutors will lodge an appeal later Monday against
last month's verdict that cleared US mining giant Newmont of
dumping toxic waste into a pristine bay.


"We will register this afternoon an appeal against the ruling by
judges in the Newmont case," head prosecutor Purwanta told AFP.


Purwanta said legal reasons for the challenge would be submitted
to Indonesia's Supreme Court within two weeks.


"We will submit the document within fourteen days after the
appeal's registration," said Purwanta. Monday is the deadline for
registering an appeal.


Prosecutors had vowed to challenge Newmont's acquittal over
charges of pumping tonnes of waste including arsenic and mercury
into Buyat Bay from its now defunct gold mine on Sulawesi island.


Prosecutors had wanted to jail company executive Richard Ness for
three years in a high-profile case closely watched by
international business leaders and environmental groups.


Ness and the company's Indonesian unit, PT Newmont Minahasa Raya,
were also accused of damaging villagers' health and poisoning
marine life.


Newmont, the world's largest gold miner, had always denied the
charges, saying it disposed of toxins safely and levels of
mercury and arsenic were within acceptable levels.


It had warned a guilty verdict would prompt it to reconsider
investing in Indonesia, which is trying to lure foreign firms and
overcome an international reputation for corruption and
bureaucratic red tape.
