The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement on Sunday rejected a
proposal for the United Nations to establish an international
court into the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister
Rafiq Hariri.


"We say no to the establishment of a tribunal under chapter
seven" of the UN charter, Hassan Nasrallah told an Iranian
television channel.


The UN has already signed a deal with the pro-Western government
to set up a special court to try suspects in the killing, but the
pro-Syrian opposition has been blocking its ratification, saying
the UN would use it for political ends.


The Security Council has the power to impose the court on Lebanon
if the deadlock continues, under chapter seven of the UN charter.


Hariri was killed in February 2005 along with 22 others in a
massive bomb blast, widely blamed on Syria, which was then forced
to end nearly 30 years of military and political domination in
Lebanon.
