The king of the tiny French Pacific island of Wallis died Monday
at his home at the age of 88, authorities in France's most
distant territory said.


Tomasi Kulimoetoke had been ill for several years. The cause of
death was not given.


Kulimoetoke became king in 1959, when the inhabitants of Wallis
and Futuna voted to become a French territory.


Around 15,000 people live in Wallis and Futuna, which is made up
of three main islands located in the Pacific Ocean northeast of
Fiji.
