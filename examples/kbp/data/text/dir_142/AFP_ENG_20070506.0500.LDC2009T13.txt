World number one John Higgins of Scotland was well in control of
the snooker world championship final as he led English qualifier
Mark Selby 11-4 late on Sunday.


Higgins won seven frames in a row to open up a 9-3 lead by the
interval of the second session in the best-of-35 showdown.


Higgins, the 1998 champion, had initially been out of sorts by
his own high standards against 23-year-old Selby - who led 3-2 at
one juncture.


But the player conjured up some magical snooker and the
confidence seemed to drain out of Selby as he was kept off the
table for long periods.


Higgins resumed holding a 5-3 advantage and made Selby pay dearly
for a double kiss on a red when trying to play safe with an
opening break of 75.


It was a similar scenario in the next when a poor break-off shot
by Selby let in Higgins again and he put together a run of 75
before his opponent conceded.


Luck was against Selby in frame 11 when he had a large 'kick' on
the blue. It left him an awkward red which he failed to convert
and in stepped Higgins for a 100 clearance.


It was the 65th century of the tournament - only three short of
the record of 68 set at the Crucible Theatre in 2002.


Selby had to stop the rot and he looked favourite when a break of
40 helped him into a 61-23 lead.


But he failed to negotiate a Higgins snooker behind the green
which left his opponent an easy opening red and a 47 clearance
sealed the frame and meant a pre-interval whitewash.
