Right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy trounced Socialist rival Segolene
Royal in France's presidential election, taking 53 percent of the
vote against Royal's 47 percent, according to official results
Monday that did not include votes from French expatriates.


The figures from the interior ministry matched those announced
earlier based on projections.


The turnout of about 85 percent in Sunday's vote was the highest
since 1981, officials said, and reflected the widespread interest
in the election of a new generation of French leaders.
