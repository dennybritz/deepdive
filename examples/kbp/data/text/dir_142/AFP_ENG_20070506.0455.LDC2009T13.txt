Seven-time Cy Young Award-winner Roger Clemens will forego
retirement a little longer and return to the New York Yankees,
the veteran hurler said in a surprise announcement on Sunday.


Clemens, who has been mulling his options throughout the first
month of the season, revealed his plans over the public address
system from the Yankees' owner's box during New York's 5-0
victory over Seattle, telling fans it was "a privilege to be
back."


The return of Clemens, who helped lead the Yankees to a pair of
World Series titles in 1999 and 2000, couldn't come at a better
time for the storied club, which has struggled with its starting
pitching for most of the season.


Due to injuries to Mike Mussina, Chien-Ming Wang and Carl Pavano,
the Yankees have been forced already to start five rookies this
season, a first in the illustrious history of the franchise.


The Yankees have inked Clemens to a minor league contract that
will allow him to get in shape to join the rotation.


Clemens, 44, has 348 career wins, eighth on baseball's all-time
list. His career winning percentage of .662 trails only Lefty
Grove (.680) and Christy Mathewson (.665) among pitchers with at
least 300 wins.


Clemens' 4,604 career strikeouts put him second all time behind
Nolan Ryan's 5,714.


Clemens made 19 starts for the Houston Astros last season, and
it's thought both the Astros and the Boston Red Sox were courting
him in addition to the Yankees.
