A rocket fired by Gaza militants into southern Israel on Monday
morning struck near a nursery school in the town of Sderot but
caused no injuries, the Israeli army and media reported.


"A Palestinian rocket fired from the Gaza Strip fell Monday into
the courtyard of a home in Sderot but did not cause any
injuries," the army said in a statement.


Israeli public radio reported that the rocket fell near a nursery
school.


Five rockets were fired into Israel by Palestinian militants on
Sunday, moderately injuring one person, according to the army.


That attack was claimed by the Al-Quds Brigades, the military
wing of Islamic Jihad.


Islamic Jihad was not party to a November truce under which
Israeli troops pulled out of Gaza in return for a commitment from
militant groups to end rocket fire from the territory.


The Israeli army says some 250 rockets have been fired into
Israel since the November truce, with about 50 explosive devices
placed along the security barrier between Israel and the Gaza
Strip.
