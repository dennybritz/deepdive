South Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries said Monday it has won a
1.19-trillion- won (1.29 billion dollar) order from a European
company to build eight container ships.


The vessels will be delivered by 2011, the world's second largest
shipbuilder said in a regulatory filing which did not identify
the buyer.


Samsung Heavy said on April 30 that it has received 6.8 billion
dollars' worth of new orders this year, more than half of its
2007 target of 11 billion.


South Korea, home to seven of the world's top 10 shipyards,
secured record orders last year because of strong demand for
crude carriers and offshore exploration equipment amid rising oil
prices.
