Riot police fired tear gas Sunday at stone-throwing protestors
gathered in central Paris to demonstrate against the presidential
election victory of rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy, an AFP
journalist said.


The clashes took place on the Place de la Bastille where about
2,000 supporters of the defeated Socialist candidate Segolene
Royal had gone to await the election results.


Supporters of the right wing president elect held their own giant
celebratory party in another part of central Paris. Sarkozy beat
Royal by 53 percent of the vote to 47 percent, according to
projections.
