China shut down more than 3,000 businesses last year for
pollution offences, state media reported Monday, citing the
country's top environment watchdog.


Sources of potable water, industrial parks and construction sites
were the main targets in a campaign covering 720,000 companies,
according to the administration.


The State Environmental Protection Administration and five other
ministerial departments looked into 28,000 cases in detail, the
China Daily said.


A total of 3,176 enterprises were shut down.


Officials suspended 163 projects, many of which were highly
polluting, such as steel and power plants.


Despite government efforts to curb pollution, China last year
failed to reach its targets of reducing energy use by four
percent per unit of gross domestic product, and cutting emissions
by two percent.
