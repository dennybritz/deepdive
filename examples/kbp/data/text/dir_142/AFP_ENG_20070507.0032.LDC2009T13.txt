More than 50 people were fined over the past week for spitting in
the streets of Beijing and refusing to correct the bad habit,
Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.


Beijing has outlawed spitting, queue-jumping, littering and other
conduct likely to tarnish the city's image when it hosts next
year's Olympics.


According to Xinhua, 56 people were fined for spitting during the
week-long May Day holiday by five inspection teams patrolling the
city.


The city government said earlier this year that spitters and
litterers would face fines of up to 50 yuan (6.5 dollars).


Some two million Chinese and 550,000 foreigners are expected to
visit Beijing during August next year, when the Olympics take
place.


The Chinese out-of-towners are the biggest worry for the
government.


While Beijing's 15 million residents have been subjected to a
massive campaign to improve their conduct ahead of the Olympics,
Chinese visitors from outside the city have missed out on the
propaganda drive.


China's tourism administration is urging travel agents to demand
better conduct from the out-of-towners.


"We are supposed to remind people constantly throughout the tour,
and also lead an etiquette discussion at the end of the tour,"
Huang Xiaohui, a guide with a Beijing-based travel agency, was
quoted as saying.


"The Olympics are coming, and we don't want to get disgraced."
