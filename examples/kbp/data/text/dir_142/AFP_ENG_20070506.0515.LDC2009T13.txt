Two earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 6.0 struck off the
coast of Fiji on Monday, the US Geological Survey said, but no
tsunami warnings were issued and there were no early reports of
damage.


The first quake, with a magnitude of 6.4, was centred 265
kilometres (165 miles) southeast of the capital Suva and 165
kilometres northwest of the southern island of Ndoi, the USGS
said.


It struck at 9:11 am local time (2111 GMT Sunday) at a depth of
687.6 kilometres.


Another 6.2 magnitude quake struck nearby less than an hour
later.


The quakes occurred near fault lines in the Pacific "Ring of
Fire", where continental plates in the earth's crust meet and
earthquakes and volcanic activity are common.
