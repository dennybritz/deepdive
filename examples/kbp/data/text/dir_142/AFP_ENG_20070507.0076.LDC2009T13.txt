A strong undersea quake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale shook
the Greek Ionian Sea island of Zakynthos on Monday but there were
no reports of casualties or major damage.


The quake hit at 4:34 am (0134 GMT) with the epicentre south of
the island, some 240 kilometres (150 miles) west of Athens, the
Athens Observatory's Geodynamic Institute said.


"It was an isolated tremor, there was no particular seismic
activity either before or after," institute seismologist Maria
Ziazia told AFP.


The Ionian Sea is one of the most seismically-active areas in
Greece, which is itself the European country most at risk from
earthquakes, suffering about half of all the quakes registered on
the continent.


The island of Zakynthos was at the centre of significant quake
activity this time last year, with 10 tremors between 5.0 and 5.8
Richter recorded between March and May, the semi-state Athens
News Agency (ANA) said.
