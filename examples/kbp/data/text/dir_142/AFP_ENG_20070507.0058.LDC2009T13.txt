A flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney was forced to turn back
after a passenger appeared to cough up a bag of heroin, airline
staff said Monday.


A Vietnam Airlines attendant discovered Kant Nguyen vomiting a
red plastic bag a few hours after the plane took off from Tan Son
Nhat airport on Saturday night, said Tran Tien Dung, the
company's chief security official.


"Our medical staff on land immediately suspected that the
passenger had swallowed drugs as he showed typical symptoms of
heroin shock," he said, adding that Nguyen, an Australian of
Vietnamese origin, is under police watch in a city hospital.


According to several state media reports, doctors removed several
items from the 35-year-old's stomach, similar to the plastic bag
he vomited on board, which customs officials said contained
heroin.


Police refused to comment on the case.


Since the beginning of the year, two Australians of Vietnamese
origin have been arrested for carrying heroin on flights between
Ho Chi Minh and Australia.


Vietnam police have made a series of arrests for heroin
trafficking between the two cities in recent years.
