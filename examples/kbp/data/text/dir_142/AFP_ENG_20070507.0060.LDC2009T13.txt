Thailand's army-backed government plans to sue Internet video-
sharing site YouTube over clips it deemed insulting to King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, an official said Monday.


"We are considering taking legal action against the website,"
said Vissanu Meeyo, a spokesman for the information ministry.


Thailand plans to sue YouTube, owned by Google, over charges of
lese majeste -- insulting the monarchy, a serious crime here that
carries up to 15 years in prison, the spokesman said.


The government, which came to power after a September coup, has
continued to block YouTube since the first clip showing the king
next to a photograph of feet, considered deeply offensive here,
appeared in April.


The YouTube ban came a week after a Thai court jailed a Swiss man
for 10 years for insulting the monarch by vandalising his
portraits.


But the king later pardoned the man, who was then deported from
Thailand.


Since the first clip, more new videos mocking the king have
appeared on YouTube, including pictures of the monarch that had
been digitally altered to make him resemble a monkey.


Thailand's 79-year-old king, almost universally adored by Thais,
is the world's longest-reigning monarch, and one of the few who
is still protected by tough laws that prohibit any insult against
the royal family.
