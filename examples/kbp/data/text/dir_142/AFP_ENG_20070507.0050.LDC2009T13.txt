Dutch bank ABN Amro, the target of a friendly takeover bid by
British bank Barclays, announced Monday it had received a rival
offer from a European three- bank consortium.


The Royal Bank of Scotland, Spain's Banco Santander and the
Belgian-Dutch Fortis offered 38.40 euros per share for ABN Amro,
compared to Barclays' bid of 36.25 euros.


A separate statement by Fortis however said ABN Amro immediately
rejected the offer, which included a bid for the Dutch company's
US subsidiary LaSalle.


Under the terms of the offer from Barclays, LaSalle had been
promised to the Bank of America.


The consortium's offer valued LaSalle at 24.5 billion dollars
(18.0 billion euros), against Bank of America's estimation of 22
billion dollars.
