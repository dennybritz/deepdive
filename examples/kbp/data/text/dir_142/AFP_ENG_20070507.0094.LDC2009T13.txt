A mysterious pig epidemic is spreading in south China's Guangdong
province and has killed more than 300 of the animals, the Hong
Kong-based Ta Kung Pao reported Monday.


The disease was first found in Silao town about 10 days ago as
pigs stopped eating, developed fevers and started haemorrhaging,
the newspaper said.


Local authorities have disinfected tainted farms and markets and
banned the transportation and butchering of pigs in infected
areas, the report said.


The disease, which is highly infectious, has caused a panic in
the local areas as residents stopped buying pork for fear of
eating tainted meat.


Experts have said there was no risk the disease could spread to
human beings, it added.
