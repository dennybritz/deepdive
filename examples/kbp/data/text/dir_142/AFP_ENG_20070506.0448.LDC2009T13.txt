Riot police fired tear gas Sunday at stone-throwing protestors
gathered in central Paris to demonstrate against the presidential
election victory of right- winger Nicolas Sarkozy, an AFP
journalist said.


The clashes took place on the Place de la Bastille where about
5,000 supporters of the defeated Socialist candidate Segolene
Royal had gone to await the election results.


Up to 300 rioters, some of whom were masked, made running attacks
on riot police who took up positions at the entrance to
boulevards leading onto the square.


Earlier a small crowd of protestors, brandishing black and red
anarchist flags, set fire to an effigy of Sarkozy in the square
before tearing it limb from limb and then stamping on it.


Supporters of the president-elect held their own giant
celebratory party in another part of central Paris. Sarkozy beat
Royal by 53 percent of the vote to 47 percent, according to
projections.
