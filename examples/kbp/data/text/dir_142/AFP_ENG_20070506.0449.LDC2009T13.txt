Spain's left wing prime minister congratulated Nicolas Sarkozy on
his victory in the French presidential election on Sunday, saying
he represented an "open and modern" right wing.


"Sarkozy represents an open and modern right that is capable of
channelling the desire for change of a country called upon to
recover its self-assurance and keep being a part of the European
locomotive in the 21st century," a spokesman for Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero said.


Zapatero offered "his most sincere congratulations" and was
expected to phone Sarkozy later on Sunday.


Zapatero considers Sarkozy to be a "solid politician whose style
and proposals have convinced a majority of the French people,"
the spokesman said.


Throughout the election campaign, Zapatero did not conceal his
preference for Sarkozy's opponent, fellow leftwinger Segolene
Royal, appearing alongside her at a campaign rally in Toulouse
before the first round of voting.


In an interview with AFP on April 15 the Spanish prime minister
said he had "great political empathy" with Royal even as he said
he had "respect" and "admiration" for Sarkozy.


Royal "has proven herself to be a politician who is up to the
task and I am certain that she will play an indispensable role on
the French political scene," Zapatero said on Sunday, according
to the spokesman.
