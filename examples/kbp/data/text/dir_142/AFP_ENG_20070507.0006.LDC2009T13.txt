Chinese President Hu Jintao on Monday congratulated Nicolas
Sarkozy on winning the French presidential election, vowing in
his message to carry relations forward, state media reported.


"China will work to promote the development of bilateral
relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, and through
joint efforts, in order to turn a new page of friendly relations
and all-round cooperation," Hu said, according to Xinhua news
agency.


"China and France have witnessed in-depth development in their
comprehensive strategic partnership in recent years," he added.


"The two sides have made substantial progress in cooperation in
the areas of politics, economy and trade, science and technology,
education and the judiciary."


France's outgoing president, Jacques Chirac, was seen by China as
a close friend who recognised the economic and political
potential of the emerging Asian giant.


Chirac visited China six times, including four times as
president.


Hu said Sino-French ties "have become a fine example of mutual
respect and friendly coexistence between countries with different
historical backgrounds, cultural traditions as well as countries
at different development stages."


Sarkozy, a tough former interior minister and son of a Hungarian
immigrant, trounced his Socialist rival Segolene Royal, taking 53
percent against Royal's 47 percent, according to official
results.
