Most French expatriate voters in Canada backed Socialist
candidate Segolene Royal, who lost her bid for France's
presidency to Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday, government figures
showed.


Fifty-four percent of French voters in Canada chose Royal,
compared to 46 who voted for Sarkozy, according to electoral
results.


On the mainland, the results were the reverse: rightwinger
Sarkozy took 53 percent of the vote against Royal's 47 percent,
according to official results that did not include votes from
French expatriates.


In Montreal, the main center for French votes outside Europe
where 32,000 registered to cast ballots, Royal won 55 percent to
Sarkozy's 45 percent.


A poll in the daily Le Devoir said last week that most non-French
citizens in Quebec would have chosen Royal had they been able to
vote.


Still, parties erupted upon news of Sarkozy's win.


Around 200 Sarkozy supporters gathered in one Montreal restaurant
for a victory celebration, singing the Queen hit "We Are the
Champions" followed by the Marseillaise.


"We will go back to France happy and confident. There is going to
be a lot of change," said Nicolas Hochwelser, who was surrounded
by fellow French students exchanging congratulations and
brandishing campaign banners.
