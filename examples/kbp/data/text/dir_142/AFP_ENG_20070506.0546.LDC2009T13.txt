Indian tourists to London in 2006 spent more than their Japanese
counterparts for the first time, according to data released by
the agency responsible for promoting London to visitors.


The Guardian daily reported on Monday that according to Visit
London, the 212,000 Indian tourists who visited the capital last
year spent 139 million pounds (204 million euros, 277 million
dollars), compared with 107 million pounds in 2005, and 78
million pounds in 2003.


The number of Indians who visited London also rose in that time,
from 130,000 in 2003.


By contrast, 230,000 Japanese tourists visited London last year,
spending 127 million pounds. The number of visitors was down from
434,000 in 2000.


Overall, a record number of tourists -- more than 15 million, a
9.4 percent increase on the year before -- came to the British
capital last year and spent 7.5 billion pounds.


The biggest chunk came from the United States, with 2.4 million
tourist visits, 16 percent of the total, accounting for 1.5
billion pounds in spending.


French, German, Spanish and Italian tourists combined to account
for more than 30 percent of visitors.


Polish tourists, meanwhile, accounted for the biggest jump,
surging from just 80,000 in 2000 to 500,000 last year.
