Right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy trounced Socialist rival Segolene
Royal in France's presidential election, taking 53.06 percent of
the vote against Royal's 46.94 percent, according to official
results released early Monday.


The interior ministry figures, updated to include votes from
expatriate French voters, matched projections given after polls
closed.


The turnout of about 85 percent in Sunday's vote was the highest
since 1981, officials said, and reflected the widespread interest
in the election of a new generation of French leaders.
