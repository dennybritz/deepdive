Asafa Powell, the 100m world record-holder whose early season has
been slowed by a sore knee, is training at full strength and will
return to competition soon, his manager Paul Doyle said Saturday.


In the past three weeks, Powell has pulled out of the Mt. Sac and
Penn Relays, along with the Jamaica International Invitational on
Saturday as he battled tendinitis in his right knee.


Jamaica's Powell, who holds the 100m world record of 9.77
seconds, had to limit his training, but Doyle said the sprinter
was now back to full strength.


"This week he managed to do full speed starts and things felt
really good, so he is definitely (feeling better)," Doyle said.
"The body has healed and he is ready to run, the only thing is
that he missed three weeks of training and we are not sure when
we are going to get him started."


The Prefontaine Classic, in Eugene, Oregon, on June 10 is one
possibility, but Doyle said Powell could race sooner.


Powell's plans to compete in the Golden League remain intact,
Doyle said.


"We are hoping to run in the Golden League and so, Oslo, Norway,
is first," Doyle said of the June 15 Oslo meeting.


"He does have commitments to run in Eugene as well ... And there
are one or two that we are considering before then," Doyle added.
"It very well could be (June 10), but we considering other
options before that as well"
