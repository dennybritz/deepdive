A small fire broke out Monday at Kuwait's Burgan oilfield, the
second largest in the world, an oil source told AFP.


"It is not a major incident. The fire department of the Kuwait
Oil Company (KOC) has responded and it is under control," the
source said, requesting anonymity.


Burgan oilfield, south of Kuwait City, produces around 70 percent
of Kuwait's total output of around 2.4 million barrels per day
(bpd). It is the world's second largest after Saudi Arabia's
Ghawar.
