Israeli leaders on Monday welcomed the victory of Nicolas Sarkozy
in France's presidential poll, hailing him as a friend of the
Jewish state.


Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert congratulated "the French
people on the election of Nicolas Sarkozy to the French
presidency."


"I am convinced that the relations between Israel and France will
develop and deepen during his mandate ... and that our
cooperation will be fruitful and we will be able to launch a
policy of peace in our region," Olmert said in a statement.


Right-wing opposition chief Benjamin Netanyahu said that "with
Sarkozy, France's politics will be much more balanced."


"He is sensitive to Israel's security needs and can make himself
heard in Arab countries," Netanyahu, a former premier who today
is the leader of the main right-wing opposition party Likud, told
army radio.


"He is a man who sees the interests of France via a different
angle and his election is a gift for Israel and Franco-Israeli
relations," he said, adding that Sarkozy, who has a Jewish
grandfather, was "a friend of Israel."
