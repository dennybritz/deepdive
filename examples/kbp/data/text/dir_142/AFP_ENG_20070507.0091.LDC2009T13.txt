Macquarie Bank on Monday revised its takeover offer for energy
infrastructure group Alinta Ltd. in a move seen as edging out
investment and advisory firm rival Babcock & Brown.


Macquarie said the new offer involved three choices for
shareholders -- a full cash option, a full scrip option offering
tax incentives and a third balanced option -- but gave scant
further details.


"Macquarie is the consortium leader and has provided the
proposal," it said.


Alinta refused to comment on the details of the proposal, which
follows Macquarie's earlier failed offer pitched at 15.45 dollars
per share.


In March, a consortium led by Babcock & Brown and Singapore
Power International outbid Macquarie for Alinta with a 7.4
billion dollar (6.0 billion US) cash and scrip offer for the
utility.


The Babcock & Brown bid, now worth 15.99 dollars per share,
also won the support of the Alinta board.


"We are well advanced in preparation of documentation and are
confident that upon satisfaction of its fiduciary obligations,
the board will continue to recommend the consortium's proposal,"
Babcock & Brown chief executive Phil Green said.


The bidding for Alinta following a bungled management buyout
proposal in January.


Since its listing on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2000,
Alinta has grown from a small, Western Australian-based gas
distributor and retailer with a market capitalisation of 350
million dollars to Australia's largest energy infrastructure
company.


Alinta shares, which last traded at 15.25 dollars, were suspended
on Monday. Shares in Macquarie Bank fell 70 cents to 90.30
dollars while Babcock & Brown eased one cent to 30.09
dollars.
