Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
offered "his most sincere congratulations" to rightwinger Nicolas
Sarkozy on his winning the French presidential election Sunday.


Zapatero, who is expected to telephone Sarkozy later Sunday,
considers Sarkozy to be a "solid politician whose style and
proposals have convinced a majority of the French people," a
spokesman for Zapatero's office said.


"Sarkozy represents an open and modern right that is capable of
channelling the desire for change of a country called upon to
recover its self-assurance and keep being a part of the European
locomotive in the twenty-first century," the spokesman added.
