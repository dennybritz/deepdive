Canada's defense ministry on Sunday confirmed that a Canadian
soldier died along with eight French soldiers in a French
military plane crash in Egypt's Sinai peninsula.


The Canadian was identified as Corporal Benoit Chevalier, an
Aerospace Control Operator who "was on board to familiarize
himself with the Twin Otter aircraft operations," it said in a
statement.


According to the Multinational Force and Observers' website, the
aircraft was a DHC-6 Twin Otter which provides transport between
the force's two camps.


Egyptian security sources on the crash site said the light
aircraft suffered a technical failure and tried to perform an
emergency landing on a road near the town of Nakhl, a remote area
in the central Sinai mountains.


All the dead belonged to the MFO, a quarter-century-old
independent peacekeeping mission which suffered its greatest loss
with the accident.


The approximately 2,000-strong force was set up in 1982 and
includes troops from 11 countries, including a large US
contingent. It is based in two camps in the Sinai peninsula.
