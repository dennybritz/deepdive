Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Monday welcomed
the French presidential election victory of Nicolas Sarkozy,
saying the right-winger would be a good leader.


In Australia's first reaction to Sarkozy's election victory on
Sunday, Downer, a senior member of Canberra's conservative
government, said he had met the future president and felt he
could do the job.


"I have met Nicolas Sarkozy from time to time and I think he'll
make a fine president," Downer said in comments transmitted to
AFP by his spokesman.


Australian Prime Minister John Howard's office said he was in a
cabinet meeting but could comment on Sarkozy's victory later in
the day.


Sarkozy, a tough former interior minister and son of a Hungarian
immigrant, trounced his Socialist rival Segolene Royal, taking 53
percent of the vote against Royal's 47 percent, according to
official results.


The outcome sparked violence in Paris and other cities across
France, as riot squads fired tear gas at anti-Sarkozy protestors
who hurled stones, bottles and even acid at police.
