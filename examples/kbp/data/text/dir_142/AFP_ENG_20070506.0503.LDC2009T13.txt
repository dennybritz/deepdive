Most Canadians want troops to come home from Afghanistan if
deaths climb and believe the mission has increased the risk of
terror attacks in their country, according to a poll published
Sunday.


Fifty-five percent of those surveyed by the SES Institute study
for the Sun- Media group said they wanted Canadian troops to
withdraw if military losses were to rise.


The same number also said the NATO alliance had supplied
insufficient resources for the troops' mission in Afghanistan to
succeed.


And 67 percent said they thought Canada's presence in Afghanistan
made their country more vulnerable to potential terror attacks.


Canada has deployed a contingent of 2,500 soldiers in southern
Afghanistan. Fifty-four soldiers and one diplomat have lost their
lives since the mission began in 2002.


The poll surveyed 1,000 people between April 26 and May 1, and
had a margin of error of 3.1 percent.
