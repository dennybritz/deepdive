Three villagers were attacked and killed by a rogue buffalo in
two separate incidents in the north-eastern Mushumbi district in
Zimbabwe, a state daily reported Monday.


The Herald newspaper quoted police spokesman Michael Munyikwa as
saying that the animal attacked the couple, Adam Wesile and his
wife Felistas when they found it feeding on their cotton crops
and mistook it for a cow.


The wife tried to drive it away from her crops but it charged at
her.


"It was however too late for the woman to run away when she
realised it was a buffalo," the newspaper quoted Munyikwa as
saying.


"She was attacked and killed on the spot before the buffalo
charged towards her husband who had rushed to rescue her and
attacked him."


After attacking the couple, the buffalo went on to kill another
villager identified as Chimanga who was fetching firewood nearby,
the newspaper said.


Wesile died at a local hospital while Chimanga's corpse was found
two days later.


The incident came weeks after a lone elephant attacked and killed
a British tourist and her 10-year-old daughter and severely
injured a guide during a tour in the Hwange game park.
