Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni will visit Egypt this week
for talks on an Arab peace plan revived at a summit in Saudi
Arabia in March, her Egyptian counterpart said in remarks
reported Sunday.


Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit was quoted as saying
by the official Mena news agency that Livni would visit Cairo on
Thursday.


The talks would also be attended by Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdel Ilah Khatib, the report said.


A senior Israeli diplomatic source told AFP earlier that "Livni
is planning to go on an official Cairo visit on Thursday for
talks on several bilateral issues, including the Saudi peace
initiative."


The peace plan revived at an Arab summit in Riyadh offers Israel
normal relations if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967
Middle East war, and allows for the creation of a Palestinian
state and the return of Palestinian refugees.


Israel, which rejected the plan when it was first launched at a
Beirut summit in 2002, has recently said it could provide a basis
for talks, provided there are amendments to the refugee issue.


The Arab League has tasked Jordan and Egypt to persuade Israel to
accept the Arab peace initiative. They are the only two Arab
countries to have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state.
