Hong Kong share prices opened 0.45 percent higher Monday, led by
property stocks on expectations that a government land auction
Tuesday will see strong interest, dealers said.


They said that investors were in a positive mood after the market
hit a record close on Friday, with Wall Street's continued gains
also supporting sentiment.


The Hang Seng Index opened up 92.91 points at 20,933.99.


The property sector index was up 418.08 points or 1.61 percent at
26,466.67.
