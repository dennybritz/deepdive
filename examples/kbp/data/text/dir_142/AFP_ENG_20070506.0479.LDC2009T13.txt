Elections in the Portuguese-owned Atlantic archipelago of Madeira
offered no surprises on Sunday, with veteran President Alberto
Joao Jardim reelected with a massive majority, projections
showed.


The projections, reported by Portuguese media, showed that
Jardim, president since 1978, has been returned to power with his
largest ever margin.


Jardim's centre-right Social Democrat Party (PSD) garnered
between 62-67 percent of the vote, compared with 14-17 percent
for the opposition Socialists. Turnout was around 55 percent.


If confirmed, this would give the PSD 30 to 34 seats in
parliament and the Socialists six to eight seats.


Jardim sparked elections in February by resigning in protest at a
new law passed by Lisbon's Socialist government cutting funding
to Madeira by 34 million euros (46 million dollars).


Jardim was last elected in 2004 for an eighth consecutive term.


Madeira comprises two inhabited islands, Madeira and Porto Santo,
and is 900 kilometres (560 miles) southwest of Portugal and 550
kilometres from west Africa. In 2004 the population was 263,000.
