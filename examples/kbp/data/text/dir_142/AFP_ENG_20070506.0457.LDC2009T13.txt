Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt called Nicolas Sarkozy
Sunday to congratulate him on his victory in the French
presidential election, the premier's spokesman said.


Verhofstadt invited Sarkozy to visit Belgium as quickly as
possible, as well as the European Union's main institutions,
which are based in the capital Brussels.


He said that he hoped the excellent cooperation between their
countries of the last few years would continue, both bilaterally
and in terms of their EU ties, the spokesman said, according to
the Belga news agency.


The leader of Belgium's Socialist party congratulated the
defeated candidate, French Socialist Segolene Royal for the
campaign she waged.


"Without doubt, Segolene Royal succeeded in mobilising young
people and getting them interested in politics," he said, after
an extremely high turnout in Sunday's second round poll.
