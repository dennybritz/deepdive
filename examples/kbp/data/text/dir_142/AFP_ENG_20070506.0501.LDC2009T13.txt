Elections in the Portuguese Atlantic archipelago of Madeira
offered no surprises on Sunday, with veteran President Alberto
Joao Jardim reelected with a massive majority, final results
showed.


"Let us celebrate a victory party. And tomorrow to work," said
Jardim, president since 1978, after winning a ninth consecutive
term with his largest-ever margin.


Jardim's centre-right Social Democrat Party (PSD) garnered 64.2
percent of the vote, compared with 15.42 percent for the
opposition Socialists.


In 2004 the PSD won 53.6 percent and the Socialists 27.5 percent.


More than 40 percent of voters abstained.


The result gives the PSD 30 seats in the 47-seat parliament and
the Socialists seven.


Jardim triggered elections in February by resigning in protest at
a new law passed by Lisbon's Socialist government cutting funding
to Madeira by 34 million euros (46 million dollars).


Jardim was last elected in 2004.


Madeira comprises two inhabited islands, Madeira and Porto Santo,
and is 900 kilometres (560 miles) southwest of Portugal and 550
kilometres from west Africa. In 2004 the population was 263,000.
