About 18,000 people posed nude on Sunday for US photographer
Spencer Tunick in Mexico City's Zocalo Square, a new record for
the American artist known for snapping his subjects in the buff.


Thousands of naked volunteers formed a giant mosaic of flesh for
Tunick, who far exceeded his own previous record of 7,000 nude
models set in Barcelona.


He told reporters "all eyes are looking south from the United
States to Mexico City to see how a country can be free and treat
the human body with happiness and not as pornography or as a
crime."


According to a preliminary count by organizers, more than 18,000
people participated in the photo shoot held in the city's vast
Zocalo Square, the third largest in the world.


Tunick had the throng of volunteers, which included a broad
sample of ages and backgrounds, pose in the fetal position and
give a salute to an imaginary flag within sight of the capital's
main cathedral and National Palace.


"It was a work of art, a political statement and at the same time
an act of love with our bodies," said university student Juan
Lagos.


It took Tunick's associates five years to secure permission for
the shoot in which the Roman Catholic cathedral on the square and
the Mexican flag will not appear.


Tunick has carried out similar photo sessions in Belgium, France,
Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States.


In 1994 he was arrested in Manhattan after a nude model posed for
him in broad daylight.
