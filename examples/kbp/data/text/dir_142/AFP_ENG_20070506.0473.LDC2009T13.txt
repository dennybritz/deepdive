Nicolas Sarkozy arrived with his wife Cecilia in a packed Paris
square Sunday to make his victory speech after winning Sunday's
presidential election.


Thousand of supporters had waited for hours for the rightwing
leader to arrive at the Place de la Concorde, where they had
earlier watched on a giant screen as their hero made an initial
speech in a concert hall.


Sarkozy, who defeated the Socialast Segolene Royal, had dined in
a posh restaurant on the Champs Elysees while the crowd was
entertained by a series of French singers.
