Glenn Roeder has resigned as manager of Newcastle after 15 months
in charge, it was reported here on Sunday.


According to the BBC Roeder has quit St James' Park 24 hours
after Saturday's home loss to Blackburn which left them
languishing in 13th in the Premiership.


The club has yet to confirm the news.


Newcastle have not scored a goal at home for over eight hours,
their worst run since 1951.


Speculation has been rife that Roeder will be succeeded by former
Bolton manager Sam Allardyce who turned down the Newcastle job
before Graeme Souness, Roeder's predecessor, was offered it in
2004.


Allardyce resigned as Wanderers boss a week ago after seven-
and-a-half years at the helm amid rumours he could also be
appointed Manchester City boss in the summer.
