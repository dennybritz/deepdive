British Prime Minister Tony Blair telephoned French president-
elect Nicolas Sarkozy to congratulate him on his victorious
election campaign, Blair's Downing Street office said Sunday.


"The prime minister congratulated Sarkozy and Sarkozy thanked the
prime minister for his congratulations," a spokeswoman for
Blair's office told AFP.


"He (Sarkozy) said he looked forward to meeting the prime
minister soon. It was a very very friendly and warm conversation,
though a very short one."


Right-winger Sarkozy defeated Socialist rival Segolene Royal,
triggering wild celebrations among Sarkozy supporters in Paris as
soon as polls closed and projections said the 52-year-old former
interior minister had around 53 percent of the vote, against
Royal's 47 percent.


Sarkozy's victory comes just days before Blair is expected to
announce his own resignation after a decade in power in Britain
later this week.
