Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sunday
congratulated French president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy for his
victory and hoped to reinforce strong ties between the two
countries.


"I have the satisfaction of sending you, in the name of my
government and the Brazilian people, my warmest congratulations
after your victory in the presidential vote," Lula said in a
statement released by the foreign ministry.


Lula expressed his "firm resolve" to "strengthen historical ties"
between France and Brazil, whose relationship had experienced
"significant momentum in recent years."


France is currently the fourth-largest foreign investor in the
South American country, with more than 400 French companies
operating there, and has also backed Brazil's bid to become a
permanent UN Security Council member.


Lula and outgoing French President Jacques Chirac have a strong
rapport, and recently met to organize for 2009 a "Year of France
and Brazil" after the resounding success of the "Year of Brazil"
in France in 2005.
