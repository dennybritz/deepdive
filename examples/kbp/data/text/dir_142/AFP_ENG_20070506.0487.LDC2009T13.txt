British rock star Pete Doherty, partner of supermodel Kate Moss,
was arrested on Saturday night on suspicion of possessing "Class
A" banned drugs, The Sun tabloid reported.


Though a police spokesman declined to confirm whether Doherty
specifically was arrested, he said: "At 2200 hours (2100 GMT) on
the 5th (of May), police stopped a vehicle on Kensington High
Street.


"A 28-year-old male driver was arrested on suspicion of
possession of a class A drug. He was taken to a west London
police station, and later bailed to return in June pending
further inquiries."


According to The Sun, Doherty was held in the police station
overnight.


The troubled Babyshambles frontman, 28, has repeatedly sought
treatment for drug addiction in countries including Britain,
France and Thailand.


In December he was fined 770 pounds (1,129 euros, 1,536 dollars)
and banned from driving for four months for possessing illegal
drugs, including crack cocaine and heroin.
