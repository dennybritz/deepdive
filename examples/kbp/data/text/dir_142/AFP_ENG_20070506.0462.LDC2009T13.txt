Riot police fired tear gas and water canon Sunday at stone-
throwing protestors gathered in central Paris to demonstrate
against the presidential election victory of right-winger Nicolas
Sarkozy.


The clashes took place on the Place de la Bastille where about
5,000 supporters of the defeated Socialist candidate Segolene
Royal had gone to await the election results.


Up to 300 rioters, some of whom tied scarves around their faces,
made running attacks with bottles and stones on riot police who
responded with baton charges.


"Police everywhere, justice nowhere," shouted some of the
rioters, while others screamed "Sarko-fascist."


The majority of the Royal supporters, some of whom staged sit-ins
in front of police lines, continued their peaceful rally as the
riots went on in one part of the square.


Earlier a small crowd of protestors, brandishing black and red
anarchist flags, set fire to an effigy of Sarkozy in the square
before tearing it limb from limb and then stamping on it.


Supporters of the president-elect held their own giant
celebratory party in another part of central Paris. Sarkozy beat
Royal by 53 percent of the vote to 47 percent, according to
projections.
