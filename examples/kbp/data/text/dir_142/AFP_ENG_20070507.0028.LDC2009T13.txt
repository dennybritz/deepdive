Israeli right-wing opposition chief Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday
repeated his call on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to resign over a
damning Lebanon war report.


"The vast majority of Israeli opinion demands that the prime
minister resign and that is also what the opposition is
demanding," the head of the Likud party told public radio ahead
of a parliament session that is due to discuss several motions of
no-confidence in Olmert's government.


Olmert currently heads a 78-member coalition in the 120-seat
Knesset and observers say there is little chance that the motions
will pass.


"The people understand that you cannot fix the errors that you
have made," Netanyahu said, addressing Olmert's government.


"Judge Winograd's report clearly established that the government
has failed in its handling of the war" against Lebanon's
Hezbollah militia last summer, he said.


The Winograd Commission report released a week ago blasted Olmert
for serious failure during the war and said Defence Minister Amir
Peretz and former chief of staff Dan Halutz had failed in their
posts, but stopped short of calling for resignations.


Olmert, his ratings in the single digits over criticism over the
war and a series of scandals that have rocked his government, has
defied enormous pressure to resign over the interim report,
saying it would be irresponsible and vowing to correct the
mistakes uncovered.
