Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Monday said Malaysia will
build a seven billion dollar pipeline to transport Middle East
oil across the north of its peninsula to East Asian countries.


"Yes we have agreed," Abdullah told reporters.


Abdullah, who is also the finance minister, said the project was
one of the government's major initiatives to develop Malaysia's
northern region.


"Anything that happens there is part of that, we take into
account all of this. We have always wanted to do more for that
area and that also will take care of the eastern corridor," he
said.


Reports have said the proposal involved construction of two oil
refineries and a 312-kilometre (194-mile) pipeline from
northwestern Kedah state to northeastern Kelantan state.
