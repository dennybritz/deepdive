Four servicemen and three guerrillas were killed Sunday in
ongoing separatist violence in the Russian republic of Chechnya,
Russian news agencies reported.


In the first of two incidents, police surrounded six guerrillas
in a house in the North Caucasus republic's Vedensk region, news
agency RIA Novosti reported.


"As a result of the fire fight, a regiment inspector, a
policeman, and a Russian interior ministry commander were
killed," RIA Novosti quoted an unnamed law enforcement source as
saying.


Three of the guerrillas were killed, and an additional four
policeman were wounded.


In a separate clash in Shalinsk region, a policeman was killed
during the arrest of another guerrilla, the agency reported.


Russian forces have fought two wars in the last 12 years to crush
separatist rebellions in Chechnya. Moscow has repeatedly declared
victory over the rebels, but clashes continue.


An estimated 100,000 of Chechnya's one million people have been
killed in the conflict, as well as, according to official
figures, some 10,000 Russian servicemen.
