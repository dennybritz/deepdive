German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday that French
president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy would strengthen the French-
German axis at the heart of the European Union.


Congratulating her fellow conservative on his victory in the
presidential runoff, Merkel said she was convinced that under him
"the German-French friendship will continue to be the basis to
secure lasting peace, democracy and prosperity in Europe."


Merkel said she was looking forward to meeting Sarkozy in the
near future "for a first exhange of views."


The partnership between France and Germany is often described as
the "motor" of the EU and Berlin is expected to be one of the
first foreign visits Sarkozy makes.


Germany holds the rotating six-month presidency of the EU and
Merkel is keen to put the European bloc on track towards a
revised constitutional treaty before the German presidency
finishes at the end of June.


French voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in
2005.
