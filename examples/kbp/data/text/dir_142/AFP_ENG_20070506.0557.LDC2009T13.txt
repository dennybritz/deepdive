The leading US Jewish organization on Sunday hailed the election
of Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France, saying US Jews have
"long admired" him because of his dedication to democratic values
and "empathy for the threats" faced by Israel.


"We have long admired Nicolas Sarkozy as a political leader
deeply committed to France's democratic values, his readiness to
confront threats to those principles, and his dedication to
strengthening trans-Atlantic relations," David Harris, executive
director of the American Jewish Committee, said in a statement.


He went on to note that the AJC has enjoyed a cooperative and
productive relationship with Sarkozy since he became interior
minister in 2002.


At a time when Jews felt threatened by the rise of anti-Semitism
across France, Sarkozy played a critical role in moving the
French government to recognize the gravity of the problem, Harris
said.


The group also said that Sarkozy was instrumental in stepping up
police protection around Jewish buildings and schools and
arresting and prosecuting individuals who commit anti-Semitic
acts.


"Further, AJC appreciates Sarkozy's empathy for the threats
Israel faces, and looks forward to discussing with the new
president ways that France, working within the EU, can
effectively contribute to the quest for peace and security for
Israel and her neighbors," the organization said in a statement.
