French president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy appeared before cheering
crowds in central Paris Sunday and promised to be "president for
all the French without exception."


"This evening is a victory for France," he said to a crowd of
10,000 in the Place de la Concorde.


"I ask you to be generous, to be tolerant, to be fraternal. I ask
you to hold out your hand. I ask you to give the image of a
France that is united, together, which leaves no-one at the side
of the road.


"My dear friends, I have seen victories before in my career. But
victory is only beautiful if it is generous. Victory is not
vengeance - it is being open in spirit. Victory only has meaning
if it is victory for the country in its entirety.


"Millions of French are watching us. Millions of French have
placed their trust in us. You must understand that the first
people I wish to address are those who did not place their trust
in us.


"I want them to understand that I will be a president of the
republic for all the French without exception."
