A small crowd of protestors burned an effigy of Nicolas Sarkozy
in a central Paris square Sunday during a rally by supporters of
the defeated presidential candidate Segolene Royal.


The protestors, bearing black and red anarchist flags, set fire
to the effigy on the Place de la Bastille before tearing it limb
from limb and then stamping on it.


The burning came as about two thousand Royal supporters, who had
gathered in the square to await the election results, stayed on
to lament the Socialist candidate's defeat to the rightwinger.
