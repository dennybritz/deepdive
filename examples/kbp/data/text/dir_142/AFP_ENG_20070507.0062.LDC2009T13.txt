Vietnam, which faces frequent criticism from abroad for violating
religious freedoms, respects the religious beliefs of its
citizens, President Nguyen Minh Triet was Monday quoted as
saying.


"Religion and belief are spiritual needs and are part of our
people. They will be with us for the entirety of our socialist
construction process," Triet said at the weekend, the state
Vietnam News Agency reported.


Triet was speaking during a meeting Saturday with prominent
Buddhist monk and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh, who lives in
exile after being barred from Vietnam by the former southern
regime and the post-1975 communist government.


The 81-year-old monk, who first returned to Vietnam two years
ago, has built an international following from his monastery in
France. Last month, he prayed for post-war reconciliation with
thousands of Buddhists outside Hanoi.


Hanh's visits have been criticised by the banned Unified Buddhist
Church of Vietnam, whose leaders are under house arrest and who
charge that Hanoi is using Hanh's visits for propaganda purposes.


Last week, a US commission called on Vietnam -- which keeps a
tight check on all religious activity -- to be reinstated on
Washington's blacklist of countries violating religious freedoms.


In March, a dissident Roman Catholic priest, Nguyen Van Ly, was
jailed for eight years after a court convicted him of spreading
propaganda against the communist state.


In the coming week, three other trials of dissidents are expected
to begin in the capital Hanoi and southern Ho Chi Minh City.
