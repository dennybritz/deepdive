Trading in Qantas shares was suspended Monday pending an
announcement after an 11.1 billion dollar (9.2 billion US)
private equity takeover bid for the airline collapsed in chaos.


The shares will remain suspended until Wednesday pending an
announcement.


The move followed an announcement by the Airline Partners
Australia (APA) consortium that it may make a fresh bid for
Qantas after a refusal by the Takeovers Panel to consider late
acceptances after Friday's deadline passed without the set 50
percent target reached.


"In view of the fact that a majority of Qantas shareholders
lodged acceptances for APA's offer, APA is exploring a number of
alternatives, including the possibility of making a renewed offer
for Qantas at 5.45 dollars per share," APA said in a statement.


The bid initially collapsed late Friday after it failed to garner
the requisite 50 percent shareholder support by a 7:00 pm (0900
GMT) deadline, prompting the private equity group to publicly
concede defeat.


But a few hours later, APA declared that the deal was not dead as
a major American investment fund had decided shortly after the
deadline had passed to back the deal, pushing acceptances to 50.6
percent.


Those hopes were however dashed Sunday when the Takeovers Panel
refused to count the late acceptances. APA immediately appealed
the rejection but the panel ruled early Monday that the decision
would stand.
