A Japanese man strangled his newlywed wife after she snooped on
his mobile phone and discovered a pornographic image, police and
news reports said Monday.


Hitoshi Kawakami strangled his wife Kazuko on Sunday night at
their apartment in a Tokyo suburb, said a police spokeswoman,
without elaborating.


She died in hospital early Monday and the police are preparing to
charge the man with murder, Jiji Press and other news reports
said.


The 28-year-old victim was playing with her husband's mobile
phone while he was taking shower and found a pornographic image,
which he received from a friend, press reports said.


The couple, who registered their marriage in February, fought
over the image, and the husband strangled his wife.


He confessed to a friend, who later informed police, the
spokeswoman added.
