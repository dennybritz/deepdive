A private equity group that saw its 11.1 billion dollar (9.2
billion US) takeover bid for Qantas Airways implode in chaos at
the weekend said Monday it may make a new boosted offer of 5.45
dollars per share.


Airline Partners Australia (APA) made the announcement in a
statement to the Australian Stock Exchange minutes after the
country's takeover regulator rejected a desperate last-ditch
appeal against its decision to declare the original bid dead.
