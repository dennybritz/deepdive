German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Sunday he
hoped Berlin and Paris would work closely together on "important
European projects" under incoming French president Nicolas
Sarkozy.


"I hope for a close German-French partnership," Steinmeier, a
Social Democrat, said after right-wing Sarkozy won Sunday's
presidential election to succeed Jacques Chirac.


"Of course I hope the cooperation will lead to progress on
important European projects," he added in a reference to the
European Union's moribund draft constitution.


Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, is trying
to win approval from the 27 member states to revive as much as
possible of an existing draft treaty during an intergovernmental
conference later this year.


While 18 countries have ratified the draft the other nine,
including Poland, suspended the process after referendums in
France and the Netherlands rejected the document in 2005,
throwing the bloc into a profound crisis.
