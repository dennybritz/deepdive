A landslide in central Vietnam, triggered by heavy rains, sent a
massive rock crashing down on a family home at the weekend,
killing a couple and their three- year-old child, an official
said Monday.


The rock, weighing up to seven tonnes, crushed the one-storey
house in Nghi Quang commune, central Nghe An province, on Sunday,
a local official told AFP on condition of anonymity.


The couple's other two children remained in serious condition at
a nearby hospital, the official said.
