Pete Sampras, owner of 14 Grand Slam titles, completed a winning
return to competitive tennis Sunday with a victory in the
Champions Cup of Boston, part of the Champions Series for former
ATP stars.


Sampras rallied to beat Todd Martin 6-3, 5-7, 11-9 in the final.


Sampras, 35, dropped his first set of the tournament and trailed
9-6 in the first-to-10 tiebreaker before rallying. He closed the
match on his serve when Martin hit a return shot long.


"I thought it was very high-level," said Sampras, who was making
his first Champions Series foray. "I thought the tennis was the
best of the whole week, at least for me anyway. Todd can still
play, and the crowd enjoyed it.


"I really had fun competing again, not nearly the intensity it
used to be, but it's still competitive and you still want to
win."


The pairing was a rematch of the 1994 Australian Open final,
where Sampras defeated Martin 7-6, 6-4, 6-4.
