A Kenya Airways official said Monday there was "practically no
chance" of finding any survivors in the wreckage of a passenger
jet that crashed in swampland in southwest Cameroon.


"Given the situation there is practically no chance there will be
any survivors," said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.


The wreckage of the six-months-old Boeing 737-800, which carried
114 people was found on Sunday in swampland in southwest Cameroon
more than 36 hours after vanishing from radar screens in a
violent storm.
