French president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy was joined by his wife
Cecilia at the victory celebrations late Sunday in the Place de
la Concorde.


The 49-year-old was absent from his side earlier when he voted in
the morning in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine. Nor was she
with him later when he was driven across Paris to give his
victory speech.


Sarkozy, 52, married Cecilia in 1996 and they have a son Louis
born the next year.


Their marriage has been turbulent, but before the election family
friends insisted she would live with him at the Elysee palace if
he won.
