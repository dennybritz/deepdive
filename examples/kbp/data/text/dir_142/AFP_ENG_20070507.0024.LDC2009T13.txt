Seventeen people were killed and another 24 injured Monday when a
bus plunged off a highway in southwest China, state media said.


Three children were among those who died in the accident, which
happened early Monday in Qianxi county, Guizhou province, the
Xinhua news agency reported.


The bus was carrying 41 passengers at the time of the accident,
Xinhua said, adding that the cause of the accident was under
investigation.


China's roads are among the most dangerous in the world. More
than 18,000 people were killed and 90,000 injured in road
accidents in the first quarter of 2007, according to official
figures.


In 2006, some 245 people died on the roads every day, although
the World Health Organisation says the real number could be twice
that indicated in the official tally.


On Friday, 14 people were killed and another 45 were injured in
southwest China's Yunnan province when a truck smashed into a
group waiting for a bus.


Last month, 26 people were killed and five injured when a bus
plunged off an overpass in southwest China.
