A rocket was fired into the Afghan capital early Monday, killing
a young man and wounding five other people, three of them
children, the city's criminal department chief said.


The rocket was fired at around 7:30 am and landed in a
residential suburb in the east of the city, General Alishah
Paktiawal told AFP.


"Six people were injured. One has died," he said, blaming the
attack on "terrorists."


The man who was killed was aged between 25 and 30, Paktiawal
said.


Rockets have been fired into the city from time to time in the
past few years but few have caused casualties or hit any
significant target. Taliban militants have been linked to some of
those attacks.


Two rockets were found primed to fire on the outskirts of Kabul
last week.


Kabul has been relatively free of attacks linked to the Taliban-
led insurgency that affects mostly southern and southeastern
Afghanistan.


On Thursday, a bomb struck a bus taking soldiers to work, killing
the driver and wounding 25 more people.


On Sunday a man dressed in an Afghan army uniform shot dead two
US soldiers outside the high security Pul-i-Charki prison on the
outskirts of the city.


The man, who was himself shot dead, appeared to have been a rogue
soldier, the US-led coalition said. An investigation was under
way.
