Cecilia Sarkozy, wife of French president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy,
was noticeably absent from his side during the course of election
day Sunday.


The 49-year-old was not with Sarkozy when he voted in the morning
in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine. Nor was she with him
later when he was driven across Paris to give his victory speech.


Sarkozy was accompanied after his victory by his two sons from
his first marriage as well as Cecilia's two daughters from her
first marriage.


Sarkozy, 52, married Cecilia in 1996 and they have a son Louis
born the next year.


Their marriage has been turbulent, but before the election family
friends insisted she would live with him at the Elysee palace if
he won.
