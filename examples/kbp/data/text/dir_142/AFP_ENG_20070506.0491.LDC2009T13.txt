Jochen Hecht scored twice and Daniel Briere had three assists as
the Buffalo Sabres advanced to the National Hockey League Eastern
Conference finals for the second straight season on Sunday.


Hecht and Briere helped the Sabres to a 5-4 victory over the New
York Rangers that completed a four-games-to-two victory in their
best-of-seven second-round series.


Chris Drury also continued his playoff success with a goal and an
assist for the top-seeded Sabres, who will meet the fourth-seeded
Ottawa Senators for the right to play for the Stanley Cup.


The President's Trophy winners during the regular season when
they led the league with 308 goals, the Sabres had managed just
four goals in the last three games against Rangers netminder
Henrik Lundqvist.


Hecht had even been in a worse scoring slump, registering just
one assist in his previous 10 post-season games.


He had scored in 16 games overall dating to March 28 against New
Jersey. But Hecht scored once during a four-goal uprising in the
second and again in the third as the Sabres again looked like the
high-flying team they were during the regular season.


The sixth-seeded Rangers pressured in the waning moments but were
unable to get the equalizer against Ryan Miller, who finished
with 32 saves.
