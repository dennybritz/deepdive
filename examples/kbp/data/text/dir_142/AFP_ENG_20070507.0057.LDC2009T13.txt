EU troops in Bosnia on Monday raided the home of an alleged
supporter of top Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic in a
bid to track down the fugitive.


A number of items were seized at the home of Vojislav Topalovic
"with the aim of discovering further information regarding the
whereabouts of the former (Bosnian Serb) leader," a statement
from the EU force said.


Topalovic is suspected of being a member of Karadzic's support
network.


The raid which was conducted at the request of The Hague-based UN
war crimes tribunal took place in the town of Rudo, close to the
Serbian border in southeastern Bosnia.


Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader during the 1992-95
war, was indicted 12 years ago by the UN tribunal on charges
including genocide, but he remains at large.


The indictment of Karadzic and his army commander Ratko Mladic
includes the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys in
the eastern town of Srebrenica.


International peacekeepers have been trying to nab the two for
years but all attempts have so far ended in embarrassing failure.


Karadzic is thought to spend his time in either Bosnia or across
the border in Montenegro, while Mladic is widely believed to be
hiding in Serbia.
