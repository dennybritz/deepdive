Hong Kong share prices finished the Monday morning 0.94 percent
higher, with the main index hitting a new record as it swept past
the 21,000 points level on the back of gains in property counters
and China stocks, dealers said.


They said investors were in a positive mood after the market's
record close on Friday, with Wall Street's continued gains also
supporting sentiment.


Property stocks surged on expectations that a government land
auction Tuesday will see strong bids from major developers.


China-related stocks rose on hopes that mainland bourses will
post further gains when they resume trade Tuesday after Labor Day
holidays.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 195.89 points at
21,036.97, off a low of 20,924.76 and a high of 21,070.21.
Turnover was 39.86 billion Hong Kong dollars (5.1 billion US).


The index's previous all-time intraday high was 20,971.46, hit on
January 24 this year while the market chalked up a record close
of 20,841.08 on Friday.
