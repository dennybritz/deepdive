A South Korean woman's former boss has been ordered to pay her 30
million won (32,300 dollars) for forcing her to go drinking with
the rest of the staff after work, court officials said Monday.


They said the Seoul High Court ruled last week in favour of the
28-year-old employee of a software games developer who sued her
ex-employer.


"Forcing drinking against (an employee's) limit and willingness
infringes on personal rights," the court said in a statement.


"If he or she suffered mental stress through forced drinking, it
constitutes an illegal act," Judge Kang Yong-Ho said.


The judge also ruled that the boss violated the woman's rights by
forcing her to stay at drinking parties after work.


South Korean employees in the past often felt obliged to go out
drinking with their boss after office hours, but the custom is
becoming less common.


The unidentified woman said she had been forced to attend at
least two after- work drinking sessions a week, sometimes lasting
until 4 am, after joining the company in April 2004.


After two months she quit and filed her lawsuit. A lower court
ruled in her favour and awarded her seven million won in
compensation but the high court in its ruling last week increased
the compensation to 30 million.


The woman also filed a separate suit accusing the boss of sexual
harassment. He was fined two million won and fired from the
company.
