India's Supreme Court Monday ordered a stay on a death sentence
of a former politician who roasted his unfaithful wife in the
oven of a city restaurant.


The Supreme Court said the stay on the death sentence was valid
until it completed hearing an appeal against the verdict on
Sushil Sharma, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.


The Delhi High Court in February had confirmed the capital
punishment handed down to Sushil Sharma by a lower court in 2005,
officials said. Sharma had challenged the verdict.


Sharma shot 29-year-old Naina Sahni, a pilot, and stuffed her
dismembered corpse into the tandoor, a large clay oven used
widely in norther India, of the state- run Bagiya restaurant in
the heart of New Delhi in 1995.


Sharma loaded kilos (pounds) of clarified butter called ghee into
the oven in an attempt to incinerate the evidence, but the smell
of burning flesh brought police to the restaurant.


Sharma, who was an officer of the India's ruling Congress party's
youth wing, was expelled from the movement after he fled from
police. He was arrested after a five-week chase across India.
