The stress of modern life has caused one in five adults in south
China's Shenzhen city to suffer from mental health problems,
state media reported Monday, citing a government-sponsored
survey.


The survey found that 21 percent of the respondents had
experienced psychological difficulties at some stage in their
lives and 17 percent currently had mental problems, the China
Daily said.


The research covered more than 7,000 permanent residents and
migrants, aged 18 and above, across a broad social and economic
spectrum, the report said.


"If the same ratio applies to all residents, it would mean 1.64
million of the total 7.77 million adult population in Shenzhen
have mental problems sometimes in their lives and 1.34 million of
them need counseling right now," the report cited the survey as
saying.


Shenzhen is often described as one of the foremost examples of
China's merciless, take-no-prisoners style of capitalism.


The China Daily said that the stress of living in a highly
competitive and fast- paced society is affecting a growing number
of Chinese.


The Ministry of Health claims about 16 million people in China
suffer mental disorders, but experts claim up to 100 million,
including at least 30 million youngsters, may suffer from mental
or psychological discomfort.
