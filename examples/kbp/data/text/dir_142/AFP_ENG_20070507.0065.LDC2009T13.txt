At least 21 people were killed and seven injured when a minibus
they were travelling in plunged into a deep ravine in
northwestern Pakistan, police said Monday.


The driver of the speeding bus lost control while overtaking
another vehicle on a sharp bend near the hill resort of Khaira
Gali late Sunday and the bus fell into a 750-feet (225-metre)
deep ravine, local police officer Tauqir Ahmed told AFP.


Police and hundreds of villagers joined the rescue operation to
retrieve the dead and injured from the ravine, he said.


The driver was among the 21 people killed in the crash, he said
adding that the victims were returning from a nearby Muslim
shrine.


Pakistan has the world's third highest death rate from road
accidents, blamed on poor roads and reckless driving.
