Kenya Airways confirmed late Sunday that the wreckage of a Kenyan
Airways plane carrying 114 people was found in swampland in
southwest Cameroon more than 36 hours after it went missing.


"Kenya Airways regrets to confirm that its flight KQ 507 has been
located on a mangrove swamp around 20 kilometres (12 miles) south
of Douala on the planned flight path," the company's CEO Titus
Naikuni told a news conference in Nairobi.


"At this time search and rescue operations are in progress and we
have no confirmed information about survivors or any possible
casualties," he said.


"The reason, apparently, that it was not sighted much earlier was
that the aircraft was covered by trees."


A search and rescue team, including Kenya Airways staff, was
still at the accident scene, he said, adding that local fishermen
had helped them locate the wreckage.


The six-month-old Boeing 737-800 was carrying 105 passengers from
at least 23 countries and nine Kenyan crew. It sent out a
distress signal shortly after taking off from Douala in a violent
storm after midnight Friday, headed for Nairobi.
