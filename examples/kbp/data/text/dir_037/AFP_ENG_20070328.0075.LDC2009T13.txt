An overwhelming majority of Palestinians think US Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice is playing a negative role in efforts to
budge the stalled peace process, said a poll published on
Wednesday.


Eighty-two percent of those questioned think Rice is playing
either a negative or a very negative role, compared with 11
percent who think her contribution is positive, according to the
survey.


Forty-four percent think Rice's diplomatic efforts have worsened
the image of the United States in the region, compared with 46
percent who sse the image unchanged and five percent who think it
has improved.


The poll, conducted by the Jerusalem Media and Communications
Centre, was published a day after Rice ended her fourth visit to
the region in as many months after failing to broker a
breakthrough in the dormant peace process.


The poll questioned 1,198 people in both the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip and had a three percentage point margin of error.
