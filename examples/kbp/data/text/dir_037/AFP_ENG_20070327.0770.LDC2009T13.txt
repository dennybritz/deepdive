Three Shanghai policemen have been convicted of graft after being
found to have helped organised crime gangs expand quickly in
China's economic hub, state press reported Wednesday.


The policemen, including a city district deputy division chief,
were involved in the protection of mafia-run illegal gambling
dens, the China Daily said.


"They received bribes from criminal organisations and with their
help the organisations expanded fast," the newspaper quoted
prosecutor Gao Yongchang as saying.


Gambling of any kind is illegal in China.


The newspaper did not say what sentence the court had handed
down, and the names of the police were not released.


Two other officers remain under investigation, the paper said.


Zou Chuanji, a spokesman for the Shanghai Procuratorate, said
that crime in Shanghai involving government employees was a
serious problem.


Citing cheating, fraud and smuggling, Zou said that the
"behaviour encourages crime and had has caused huge losses to the
country and people."


In the most recent high-profile case of corruption in Shanghai,
its Communist Party chief, Chen Liangyu, was sacked for his
involvement in the siphoning off of around 400 million dollars
from the city's retirement fund.
