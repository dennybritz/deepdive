A private Malaysian cable operator has postponed the broadcast of
a popular television talent show scheduled on the Prophet
Mohammed's birthday after criticisms from Islamic scholars.


Operator Astro said it would move its regular Saturday broadcast
of the Akademi Fantasia program, which falls this week on the
Prophet's birthday, to Sunday instead.


"In view of the Prophet Mohammed's birthday celebration this
coming Saturday ... the live telecast of Akademi Fantasia 5 week
3 concert will be moved to Sunday," Astro said in a statement
released to AFP Wednesday.


Astro said it would instead air an episode of the programme on
Saturday with a special focus on the Prophet Mohammed's birthday.


Akademi Fantasia, which has legions of loyal fans, is a spin-off
from a Mexican talent show and features contestants performing in
a weekly Saturday concert broadcast live.


The network manager for Astro Ria, the channel which broadcasts
the programme, had last week refused to re-schedule the show.


However, influential Islamic scholars this week reportedly
questioned the programme's worth and said it was disrespectful to
air the show on the Prophet's birthday.


Their criticism followed a year-long ban imposed by state radio
and television on a well-known Malaysian actress earlier this
month after she compared gossip about one of her relationships to
the Prophet Mohammed's wife.


Her comments sparked outrage from viewers and attracted the
attention of the Islamic authorities.


A number of media outlets in the Muslim majority country have
also been punished in the past year for content deemed insulting
to Islam.
