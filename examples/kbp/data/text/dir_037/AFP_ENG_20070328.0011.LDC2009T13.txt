A suicide bomber blew himself up close to an intelligence
director's vehicle in the Afghan capital Kabul Wednesday, killing
four civilians and wounding another 12, the intelligence service
said.


The Taliban-style bombing took place during rush hour in the city
centre near many government and business buildings. Suicide
attacks are uncommon in the heavily-guarded capital.


Police had cordoned off the area and firefighters were washing
blood and pieces of flesh off the road. Parts of what appeared to
be the attacker's body were wrapped in a plastic bag, an AFP
reporter witnessed.


"In the attack four innocent civilians were martyred and another
12 civilians were wounded. The intelligence director survived the
attack," said an intelligence service press statement read over
the phone to AFP.


The bomber targeted Kamaludin Khan Achikzay, an intelligence
director who was driving to work. Achikzay and his guards escaped
the attack unhurt, said the statement.


Kabul criminal investigation police chief General Ali Shah
Paktiawal, speaking from the scene of the attack, blamed the
bombing on "enemies of people."


Afghan officials often use the phrase to refer to Taliban
militants who were ousted from power in late 2001 by the US-led
invasion of Afghanistan and have since waged a bloody insurgency.
