Australia's women's water polo team are to make an an official
complaint alleging an Italian opponent bit their star player Kate
Gynther.


The incident happened in Australia's 12-8 victory over the
Olympic champions at the world championships here and is not
isloated, said coach Greg McFadden.


"We love beating them because it's been happening for years like
that, so the girls have never got any worries about firing up
against Italy,'' McFadden said, adding that Gynther was bitten on
the forearm and the skin was broken.


"They just fall over the top and they bite. There are three girls
in the team who do it all the time," he claimed.


"The referees can't see it. It's pretty hard to see because a lot
happens underwater, so we've got to write an official complaint
about it and we will."


Australia are water polo's number one nation after beating Italy
in last year's World Cup final.
