Kyrgyzstan's prime minister sacked seven members of his cabinet
on Wednesday in what he described as a good-will gesture to
restive opposition forces.


Prime Minister Azim Isabekov told a news conference he had
dismissed deputy prime minister Daniar Usenov, economy minister
Sabyr Moldokulov, emergencies minister Janysh Rustenbekov and
health minister Shailobek Niyazov as well as the head of the
cabinet office, the head of the environment agency and the head
of the patents office.


These sackings from the 23-member cabinet follow the sacking last
week of the prosecutor general, who is also a cabinet member.


"I've dismissed these people so that new forces can enter the
government, new people with new ideas, so the government will be
rejuvenated and the opposition will be taken into account," the
prime minister said.


Opposition parties are planning mass protests for April 11 to
demand concessions from President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, in
particular the inclusion of their representatives in government.


This Central Asian country has experienced instability and
numerous street protests since a 2005 uprising in which Bakiyev's
predecessor fled the country.


The latest changes come amid growing discontent with Bakiyev and
the defection to the opposition of his election partner, former
prime minister Felix Kulov.
