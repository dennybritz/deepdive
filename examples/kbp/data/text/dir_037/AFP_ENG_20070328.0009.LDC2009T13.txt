A suicide bomber blew himself up close to an intelligence
director's vehicle in the Afghan capital Kabul Wednesday, killing
four civilians and wounding another 12, the intelligence service
said.


"In the attack four innocent civilians were martyred and another
12 civilians were wounded. The intelligence director survived the
attack," said an intelligence press statement read over the phone
to AFP.
