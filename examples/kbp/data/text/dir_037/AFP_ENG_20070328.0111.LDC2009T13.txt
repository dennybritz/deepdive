Hong Kong share prices closed 0.78 percent lower Wednesday
tracking falls on overseas markets after weak data renewed
worries over the US economy, dealers said.


They noted that blue chips such as HSBC and China Mobile were
also pressured by trade related to the expiry of March futures
contracts on Thursday.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 152.92 points at 19,553.87, off a
high of 19,729.31 and a low of 19,459.19. Turnover was 49.65
billion Hong Kong dollars (6.4 billion US).
