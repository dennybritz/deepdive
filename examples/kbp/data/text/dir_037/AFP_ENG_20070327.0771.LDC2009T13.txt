More than 40 percent of South Korean farmers and fishermen who
married last year found their brides overseas, notably in
Vietnam, government statistics showed Wednesday.


The National Statistical Office said that of the 8,596 men from
farming and fishing villages who married last year, 3,525 or 41
percent took foreign brides -- a 5.1 percent rise from 2005.


Some 2,394 were from Vietnam, 718 from China and 170 from the
Philippines.


The office said the number of Vietnamese brides in South Korea
totalled 10,131 last year, up 74 percent from 2005.


The rapid rise in international marriages in the countryside
reflects the increasing preference of South Korean women for city
life. Local matchmaking agencies often arrange weekend trips to
Vietnam for farmers and fishermen.


Vietnam's rural areas -- whose men have mostly moved to the
cities for work -- supply many of the brides, said Kim Hyun-Jae,
a professor who studied the topic at South Korea's Youngsan
University in Busan.


Kim said in a recent report quoted by Chosun Ilbo newspaper that
the rising popularity of South Korean dramas and films in Vietnam
also encourages them to come here.


But foreign brides face language and cultural differences and
occasionally domestic violence.


Overall, international marriages in South Korea fell eight
percent year-on-year to 39,690 in 2006.
