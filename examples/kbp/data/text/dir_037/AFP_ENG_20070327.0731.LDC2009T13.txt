Concerned parents have been buying stab- and bullet-proof vests
to protect their children in the wake of a string of fatal
stabbings in Britain, the Daily Mail reported on Wednesday.


VestGuard UK, which supplies stab- and bullet-proof vests to
government agencies around the world, said it had received more
than a hundred calls from parents in London alone, whereas it
usually receives about one or two inquiries from parents across
the country most years.


About 60 vests, which cost between 200 pounds and 425 pounds
(295-625 euros, 395-835 dollars) each, have been ordered.


The surge in the interest in stab-proof vests follows fatal
knifings in Britain, notably those of teenagers Adam Regis, and
Kodjo Yenga, both in London in the past two weeks.


"They (parents) are concerned by what is happening on the streets
-- the level of violence," Shaun Ward, VestGuard UK's sales
director, was quoted as saying by the Mail.


"We have been making really small vests that have a 28-inch
(71-centimeter) chest and weigh 800 grams. The children have been
mostly boys, but there are a few girls."


The vests sold by VestGuard UK are slightly softer and more
flexible than comparable versions worn by police, but have been
tested extensively and the company claims they can withstand a
shot from a crossbow.
