A lovelorn Chinese herdsman who is the world's tallest man has
finally found his other half in a sales clerk who comes up to his
elbow, state media reported Wednesday.


Bao Xishun, who stands 2.36 metres (seven feet nine inches), will
marry 1.68-metre Xia Shujun, who is also half the groom's age at
just 28, the Beijing News reported.


The 56-year-old Bao had conducted a worldwide search for a bride
who is up to becoming Mrs. Bao, but eventually found Xia, a
saleswoman in a clothing store, in his own home region of Inner
Mongolia in northern China, it said.


After a one-month courtship, they decided to get married and will
tie the knot this summer, Xinhua news agency said.


"Xia said that as they got to know each other she stopped
noticing how tall Bao was and was moved instead by his
thoughtfulness," it said.


After a lifetime as a bachelor, Bao, who is a celebrity in China,
began searching for a bride last year and heard back from more
than 20 interested parties from across the country.


Bao was confirmed last year by the Guinness Book of World Records
as the world's tallest living man.


He also made headlines late last year when he was called upon to
use his long arms to pull plastic trash from the stomachs of two
ailing dolphins at an aquarium in northeastern China.
