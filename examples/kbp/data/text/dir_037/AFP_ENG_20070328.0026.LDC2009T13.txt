Hundreds of Israeli police moved into a former settlement in the
occupied West Bank on Wednesday to clear about 300 settlers and
rightwingers occupying the site, an AFP photographer said.


The settlers had moved into Homesh, a settlement cleared as part
of Israel's so- called disengagement plan in 2005, on Monday.


Then prime minister Ariel Sharon evacuated Homesh and three other
West Bank settlements as well pulling out of the Gaza Strip as
part of the now-defunct plan for a partial withdrawal from the
West Bank.


Homesh, which was established as a military outpost in 1978, was
turned over to settlers in 1980. Many of its 70 families were
pious and militant zealots who believed they were doing God's
work resettling their biblical homeland of Samaria.
