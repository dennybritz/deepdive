Transactions in China's real estate market surged 69 percent in
2006, funded to a great extent by foreign investment, a leading
research firm said Wednesday.


"There is increasingly more investment going into industrial
property," Kenny Ho, a Shanghai-based head of research with Jones
Lang LaSalle, a real estate money management and services firm,
told AFP.


Despite government measures to cool the real estate market,
China's heady growth in the past and strong potential for the
future have made it "a magnet for cross-border investors," said a
report by the firm.


The Chinese economy saw its fourth consecutive year of double-
digit growth in 2006, and the report forecast the country's 2007
growth at 9.5 percent.


The report focused on the commercial real estate sector, which
excludes multi- family residential real estate.
