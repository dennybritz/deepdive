Forty-five Iraqi men were shot dead execution-style in the
northern town of Tal Afar after bombing attacks that killed 75
people there, a hospital medic said on Wednesday.


"We received 45 bodies of handcuffed and blindfolded men from al-
Wahada neighbourhood overnight. They were killed yesterday just
after the bomb," a doctor at Tal Afar hospital told AFP on
condition of anonymity.


The Iraqi army has slapped a strict curfew on the town, deployed
armoured vehicles in downtown Tal Afar and banned even police
from moving, an official said, also on condition of anonymity.
