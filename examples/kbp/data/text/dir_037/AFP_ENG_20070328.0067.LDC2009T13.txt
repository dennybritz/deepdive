Gunmen kidnapped an Afghan medical team of a doctor, three nurses
and a driver in the southern province of Kandahar, Afghan health
officials said Wednesday.


"The team from Kandahar Health Department was abducted by unknown
gunmen," the department's local chief Abdul Qayoom Pakhoa told
AFP.


Pakhoa said they were kidnapped from Zhari district, 30
kilometers (19 miles) west of Kandahar city on Tuesday.


Zhari has seen frequent Taliban activity in recent months.


The Taliban are known to have kidnapped Afghan officials,
journalists and members of governmental organisations.


They are still holding an Afghan journalist who was kidnapped
earlier this month along with an Italian journalist. The Italian
was later released.
