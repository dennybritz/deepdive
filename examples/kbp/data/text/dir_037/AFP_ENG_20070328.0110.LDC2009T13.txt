EU regulators approved on Wednesday plans by Japanese group NTN
to buy 80 percent of French car maker Renault's bearings business
SNR.


"After examining the operation, the (European) Commission
concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede
effective competition," the EU's antitrust watchdog said in a
statement.


Under an agreement reached in July, NTN is to buy at first a 35
percent stake in SNR, which will then be raised to 51 percent one
year later and two years after that the stake will be increased
to 80 percent.


The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal when it was
announced in July.


With headquarters in Annecy southeastern France, SNR employs
4,200 people at five sites in France and had sales of 560 million
euros in 2005.


It makes bearings for industrial, aeronautical and automotive
uses mainly for the European market.
