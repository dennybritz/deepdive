Malaysia, the chair of the 57-nation Organisation of the Islamic
Conference, called on fellow member Iran not to defy new
sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council, a report said
Wednesday.


Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he hoped Iran would
consider the implications of the sanctions imposed at the
weekend, the New Straits Times reported.


"This is a decision by all UN members and it is hoped Iran will
abide by it," Abdullah was quoted as saying by the newspaper.


"I hope Iran will study the sanctions. It will be difficult for
Iran to defy them," he said.


Abdullah reiterated Malaysia's stance that countries have a right
to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but noted Iran's refusal
to heed UN calls for it to suspend its uranium enrichment
programme.


"In this case, there are now problems arising that prompted the
UN to reach the decision. Iran should act quickly to abide by
it," he said.


Mainly Muslim Malaysia shares a range of business and economic
ties with Iran, and has in the past urged the West to be patient
in dealing with Tehran over its controversial nuclear programme.


The United States charges that the programme is a cover for
secretly developing nuclear weapons and has not ruled out
military action to prevent this.


Iran insists its programme is aimed exclusively at producing
nuclear energy.
