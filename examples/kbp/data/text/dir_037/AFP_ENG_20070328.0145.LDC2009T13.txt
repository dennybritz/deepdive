The British economy grew by 2.8 percent in 2006, which was faster
than last month's estimate of 2.7 percent, official data showed
on Wednesday.


British gross domestic product grew by 0.7 percent during the
fourth quarter of 2006 from the third quarter, the Office for
National Statistics added in its third and final estimate.


That was a slight downward revision from the previous estimate of
0.8 percent.


Last week, British finance minister Gordon Brown held his
economic growth forecasts as he unveiled his eleventh and
probably final budget before taking over from Prime Minister Tony
Blair later this year.


Brown predicted economic growth of 2.75-3.25 percent in 2007 and
of 2.5-3.0 percent in 2008 and 2009.


The British economy grew by just 1.9 percent in 2005.


Separately, the ONS revealed that Britain's current account
deficit ballooned to a record 12.7 billion pounds (18.7 billion
euros, 24.9 billion dollars) in the fourth quarter of 2006,
compared with 10.5 billion pounds in the third quarter.
