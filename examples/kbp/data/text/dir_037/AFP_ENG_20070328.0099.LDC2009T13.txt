HIV/AIDS is ravaging the large overseas work force of the
Philippines, posing a long-term threat to one of Manila's key
sources of foreign exchange, the health department said


Thirty-five percent of all documented cases of HIV carriers are
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), including 42 percent of the
newly reported cases in 2006, according to new data released by
the department.


The government estimates there were some 11,200 HIV carriers in
the Philippines as of December 2005.


"It is a must that we act now because OFWs are regarded as
modern-day heroes and are major contributors to the country's
gross domestic product and economic stability in general," said
Health Secretary Francisco Duque.


He said there were limited services to educate and support
families of overseas Filipino workers who return home suffering
from the virus that causes AIDS.


The health department is "aggressively bridging the gap in terms
of access to comprehensive HIV and AIDS services," Duque said.


Some 241 HIV carriers now receive free antiretroviral drugs from
the health department and their number should rise once other
sufferers register with the government, he added.
