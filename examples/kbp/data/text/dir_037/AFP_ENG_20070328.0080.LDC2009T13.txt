German inflation looks set to pick up this month, regional
consumer price data showed on Wednesday.


In the central state of Hesse, the consumer price index (CPI)
rose by 1.9 percent on a 12-month basis in March, fractionally
faster than the 1.8 percent recorded in February, the regional
statistics office in Wiesbaden said.


In the eastern state of Brandenburg, the 12-month rate of
inflation was steady at 1.9 percent.


But a slight pick-up was also seen in a number of other key
regional states.


In the eastern state of Saxony, CPI rose by 2.5 percent on a
12-month basis in March, compared with 2.3 percent in February.


In the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the cost of
living rose by 2.0 percent on a 12-month basis this month, up
from 1.9 percent in February.


And inflation in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous
state, accelerated to 1.8 percent on a 12-month basis in March
from 1.6 percent in February.


Regional inflation data from six so-called indicator states --
Baden- Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Brandenburg, Hesse, North Rhine-
Westphalia and Saxony -- are used to calculate preliminary pan-
German inflation.


In February, pan-German inflation had stood at 1.6 percent,
comfortably below the level of 2.0 percent that the European
Central Bank sees as a ceiling for inflation in the 13 countries
that share the euro.
