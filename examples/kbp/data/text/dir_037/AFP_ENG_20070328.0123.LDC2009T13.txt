Royal Dutch Shell said Wednesday that Jeroen van der Veer would
remain at the helm of the Anglo-Dutch oil group until 2009.


"Royal Dutch Shell plc announced today that Jeroen van der Veer
will continue as chief executive until 30 June 2009," Shell
announced in a brief statement to the London Stock Exchange.


Van der Veer, 59, has been chief executive since 2005. That year,
Royal Dutch Shell moved to a more traditional single-board
structure with one chairman and one chief executive, scrapping
its dual-board arrangements in Britain and the Netherlands.


"Jeroen's decision today provides clarity, and I am most pleased
that he will stay on longer, providing valuable continuity and
leadership in Shell," said chairman Jorma Ollila in the
statement.


Shell is the world's second-biggest oil group by stock market
capitalisation, behind US titan ExxonMobil.
