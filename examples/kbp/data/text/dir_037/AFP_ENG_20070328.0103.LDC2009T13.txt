A correspondent with Israel's leading daily, Yediot Aharonot, is
in Riyadh to cover the Arab League summit opening on Wednesday,
the paper said on its front page.


Orly Azulay, who has been Yediot's correspondent in Washington
for several years, arrived in Saudi Arabia's capital with other
journalists accompanying UN chief Ban Ki-moon, the paper said.


Moon is scheduled to address the summit, which opens later in the
day.


Yediot did not say whether Azulay had used an Israeli passport to
enter the kingdom, which does not have relations with the Jewish
state.


The summit is expected to formally adopt a five-year-old peace
plan for comprehensive peace in the Middle East, which offers
Israel full normalisation with the Arab world in exchange for
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory, the creation of a
Palestinian state and return of refugees.
