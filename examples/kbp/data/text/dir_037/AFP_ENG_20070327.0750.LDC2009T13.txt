China will soon allow companies to freely import a wide range of
steel materials and other products as part of efforts to shrink
its huge trade surplus, state press reported Wednesday.


From April, Chinese firms will no longer need to apply for import
licenses for 338 product categories, including steel plates and
slabs, plastic materials and some machinery and electronic
products, the China Daily said.


The relaxation of import license administration marks the latest
attempt by the government to rein in the country's widening trade
surplus.


China is under considerable pressure to address its trade surplus
as concerns are multiplying that its booming exports are wiping
out jobs in key trading partners, especially in European and US
manufacturing.


China's trade surplus last year soared 74 percent to hit a record
177.5 billion dollars and has continued to spiral upwards this
year.


China posted a near-record 23.8-billion-dollar trade surplus in
February on a 51.7 percent increase in exports.
