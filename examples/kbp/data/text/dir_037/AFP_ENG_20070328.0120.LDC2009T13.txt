Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya said on Wednesday that
substantial progress had been made towards securing the release
of an Israeli soldier captured by Gaza militants nine months ago.


"There have been contacts with our brothers in Egypt and the
resistance factions which captured the soldier and I can confirm
there has been major progress," Haniya told AFP in Riyadh, where
Arab leaders are meeting for their annual summit.
