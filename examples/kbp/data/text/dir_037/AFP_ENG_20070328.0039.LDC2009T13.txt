Two US servicemen and a contractor who worked with the American
embassy in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone have been
killed in separate attacks in Iraq, US officials said Wednesday.


The contractor, a US citizen, died on Tuesday after being wounded
a day earlier by rocket fire near the embassy in the Green Zone,
the seat of the US mission and the Iraqi parliament, US charge
d'affaires Daniel Speckhard said.


One soldier was killed on Tuesday and another wounded in a
separate indirect fire attack in the Green Zone, the military
said Wednesday.


A US marine also died on Tuesday after being attacked during
combat operations in the western Sunni province of Anbar, it
said.


The latest military casualties brought the its losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion to 3,237, according to AFP count
based on Pentagon figures.
