The Chinese government has blasted local officials for setting a
bad example in energy conservation with their luxurious office
buildings, state media reported Wednesday.


Some local governments pursue new, unique and special office
buildings, but totally neglect their energy efficiency, the China
Daily said, citing Qiu Baoxing, deputy minister of construction.


"This is not the White House," Qiu told a gathering of officials
in Beijing, while pointing at a slide showing a magnificent
office building. "This is the office building of a district
government."


Qiu said statistics showed most office buildings in China's major
cities were far less energy efficient than those in other
international cities with similar climates.


Part of the problem was that construction companies failed to
keep their promises for more energy-efficient buildings, Qiu
said.


The paper quoted Qiu as saying almost 95 percent of the new
designs proposed last year met energy conservation standards,
while more than half of the finished buildings did not.


China previously said it was aiming to cut energy consumption per
unit of gross domestic product by 20 percent and pollution by 10
percent by 2010 from levels in 2005.


But the project got off to a bad start, with Chinese officials
admitting recently they had come nowhere near reaching the
targets for 2006.


Energy consumption per unit of GDP fell by just 1.23 percent last
year, instead of 4.0 percent as planned.
