Ryan Whitney scored twice and Sidney Crosby added a goal and an
assist as Pittsurgh posted a 4-3 win over the Washington
Capitals, sweeping the season series.


Rookie Evgeni Malkin had two assists and Michel Ouellet tallied
for Pittsburgh (44-23-10), which remained tied with the New
Jersey Devils for first place in the Atlantic Division with 96
points. The Devils beat the New York Islanders, 3-2.


The win put Pittsburgh in the National Hockey League playoffs for
the first time since the 2000-01 season when they reached the
conference finals vs. New Jersey.


After the Capitals took a 2-0 lead on first-period goals by
Alexander Semin and Boyd Gordon, the Penguins used three power-
play scores between the opening and second stanzas to take
control of the contest.


Trailing, 2-1, after Ouellet banged in a rebound past goaltender
Olaf Kolzig with 7:52 left in the first, Whitney knotted the
score just 70 seconds into the second when he received a pass
from Crosby and one-timed a shot past the Washington netminder.


Crosby collected his 35th goal of the season on the power play
when he jammed in a shot between Kolzig and the right post
following a scramble, giving the Penguins a 3-2 advantage at 6:21
of the second. It was the two-time All-Star's league-leading
113th point of the season.
