Bank of China, the nation's second-largest state-owned commercial
bank, has launched a private banking service targeting only
millionaires, state media said Wednesday.


Clients will have to prove financial assets valued at more than
one million dollars to be eligible for the service, the China
Securities Journal reported, citing Yue Yi, general manager of
the bank's retail business.


"It is a bank for the top rich," said Yue.


Currently, the number of people in officially communist China
with financial assets exceeding one million dollars has reached
320,000, according to the paper.


Services will initially be available in Beijing and Shanghai, two
of the nation's wealthiest cities, the report said.


The service will provide clients with customised products and
they will receive advice from more experienced consultants than
the average customers.


As another sign of their value to the bank, they will be served
in private service rooms.


Yue said private banking has very large space to grow in China
and its contribution to the bank's profit will rise year by year.
