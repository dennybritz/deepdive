England striker Michael Owen, currently recovering from injury,
wrote in a comment piece published Wednesday that he could "count
on one hand" the number of times England had played excellent
football for an entire match in the last decade.


Writing in The Sun tabloid, the 27-year-old Newcastle player
said: "Maybe it is not something we want to admit, but I can
count on one hand the times we have played fantastically well
through 90 minutes in my decade with England."


"We were great against Germany in the famous 5-1 win in Munich in
2001, but mostly it has only ever been in patches."


Owen's comments come ahead of a match between England and Andorra
later on Wednesday, with England hoping to turn around a
struggling campaign to qualify for Euro 2008.


England have gone five matches without a win, and have scored
just one goal in that period.


"There is no doubt that most, if not all, of our players
consistently perform better at club level. We find it hard to
replicate that form for our country," wrote Owen, who injured his
knee playing for England in the 2006 World Cup in Germany.


"Is it the pressure? ... Are the expectations too high? Are we
not as good as we think we are? Is it because other teams raise
their game?"


The striker said that the "intense glare" of the English media
and fans made it "harder to have a relaxed atmosphere and it is
particularly trying when the team is not performing as they can."
