South Korea's LG Electronics said Wednesday it has reached a deal
with the world's leading search engine Google to pre-install its
services on millions of mobile phones.


Mobile users worldwide will be able easily to search for
information, find locations, update blogs and manage e-mail while
on the move, LG said in a statement.


"LG's mobile devices, combined with Google, will provide
consumers with easy access to their favourite Internet services
even without a PC, and make it easy for them to stay connected
while in motion," Paul Bae, vice president of product planning at
LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company, said.


Selected LG handsets, pre-installed with Google products and
services, will be shipped globally in the second quarter. They
will offer one-click access to Google's search engine as well as
Google maps, Gmail and Blogger Mobile.


Samsung Electronics in January signed a similar pact with Google.
