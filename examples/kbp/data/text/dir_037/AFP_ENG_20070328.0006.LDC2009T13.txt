Gunmen holding 32 children hostage on a school bus in the
Philippine capital Wednesday released a boy suffering from high
fever, police said.


Action movie star and Senator Ramon Revilla, who knows one of the
suspects, went inside the bus and later came out cradling a boy
more than four hours into the hostage drama, an AFP reporter on
the scene said.


Thirty-one pre-schoolers and two teachers are still believed held
by up to three gunmen aboard the bus, which has been surrounded
by police outside the Manila city hall.


The head of a day care centre where the children went to school
and up to two associates had hijacked the bus and taken his own
pupils hostage to demand free education and housing for the
children and their families, police said.
