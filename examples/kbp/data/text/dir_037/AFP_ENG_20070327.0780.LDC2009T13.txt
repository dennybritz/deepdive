A Pakistani soldier and two other people died Wednesday in
clashes between security forces and militants in a northwestern
town where rebels kidnapped a school headmaster, officials said.


Several buildings were damaged overnight as militants launched
rocket and mortar attacks on government installations and private
property in Tank, which borders the restive South Waziristan
region, they said.


Security forces retaliated and three people died in the five-hour
battle, local police official Noor Aslam told AFP, including a
soldier of the paramilitary Frontier Constabulary.


"Two other bodies were recovered from the town's main bazaar this
morning. The bodies have not yet been identified," he said.


Two guards at local private banks were also injured, he added.
Six of the banks were also hit, along with a paramilitary fort, a
college and some government installations.


Army helicopters were flying over the town early Wednesday after
the battle, witnesses said.


The attacks came two days after a deadly clash between police and
militant recruiters outside a high school in the town on Monday
in which a local extremist leader and a policeman were killed.


Armed gunmen late Tuesday abducted the principal of the school,
Farid Mehsud, and his brother, their family said. The kidnappers
told the family that the abduction was to avenge Monday's killing
of the militant.


The principal on Monday had called for police protection after a
group of local Taliban visited his school and others in a bid to
recruit youth to fight "jihad" or holy war against NATO and US
forces in Afghanistan.
