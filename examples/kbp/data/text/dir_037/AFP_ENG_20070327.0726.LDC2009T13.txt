The US farm state of Nebraska on Tuesday signed a 17.5 million-
dollar deal to sell food to Cuba, which lobbied to end an embargo
on the communist island.


Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman said the agreement represented a
continuation and deepening of the relations between his state and
Cuba, signed in 2005 and 2006 and totaling 60 million dollars.


Heineman was on his third business to Havana, heading a trade
mission of 30 companies, the largest ever to visit Cuba. They met
with Cuba's Alimport president Pedro Alvarez.


Although the United States has banned most commerce, exceptions
for food and medicines apply.


The Louis Dreyfus company will sell 75 tonnes of wheat and
Farmland company will sell pork. The 2005 and 2006 deals included
beef, turkey, beans, soy and corn.
