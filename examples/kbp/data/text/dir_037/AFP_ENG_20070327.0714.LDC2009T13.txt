Up to three men armed with grenades and handguns commandeered a
bus and took 32 children and two teachers hostage in the
Philippine capital Wednesday, police said.


A crack police team surrounded the bus which was stopped outside
Manila city hall. The children were apparently on a field trip.


"The initial report that we have is that 32 students and two
teachers are inside the bus and being held hostage by two men
armed with grenades and firearms," a Manila police officer told
DZBB radio.


Police later said they believed there were three hostage takers,
having miscounted in the confusion.


The armed men announced on a message written on cardboard in the
bus windscreen that they were holding the students and teachers
hostage.


The suspects said they had machine pistols and grenades and
demanded free housing and education for an unspecified group of
children.


Terrified children, who looked to be either pre-schoolers or
elementary school pupils, were seen peeking and waving from
behind the window curtains.


One of the hostage-takers was seen holding threateningly on to a
child while a woman, apparently one of the teachers, tried to
pacify the children.


"We have 32 children hostages and two teachers. We are armed with
two grenades, an Uzi (sub-machinegun), and .45 calibre pistols,"
they wrote in a notice they displayed on the bus windscreen.
