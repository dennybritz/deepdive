Chinese share prices closed mixed Wednesday as early morning
profit-taking was offset by strong capital inflows in afternoon
trade, with banking stocks and steelmakers gaining ground,
dealers said.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, closed up 34.19 points or 1.09 percent at 3,173.02,
another record finish made on turnover of 151.12 billion yuan
(19.51 billion US dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 36.23 points or 1.10 percent to
3,334.57 on turnover of 150.52 billion yuan.


The Shenzhen A-share Index, however, was down 6.26 points or 0.71
percent at 872.73 on turnover of 69.40 billion yuan, having
recovered from morning losses of 3.07 percent.
