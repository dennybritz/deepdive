The European Union on Wednesday kickstarted membership talks with
Turkey, which have been at a standstill since June, an EU
diplomat said.


EU ambassadors agreed that Turkey could begin negotiations,
probably on Thursday, on one of the 35 policy chapters that each
aspiring country must complete to join the rich European club.
