Consumer sentiment in Germany, the biggest economy in the
eurozone, is stabilising after a steep rise in value-added or
sales tax (VAT) weighed on sentiment in previous months, a new
poll showed on Wednesday.


The consumer sentiment index calculated each month by market
research group GfK was forecast to edge up to 4.4 points in April
from 4.3 points in March, the think-tank said in a statement.


"The period of weakness in the consumer climate appears to have
come to an end, at least for now," GfK said.


"The reason for this is the renewed rise in consumers'
willingness to spend. Improved income expectations are also
supporting the upward trend. By contrast, economic expectations
did not rise, but are nevertheless stabilising at a high level,"
it said.


For its monthly survey, GfK quizzes around 2,000 consumers on
their views on the economic outlook, income expectations and
their propensity to buy.


The responses are then used to calculate an overall consumer
climate index.


The survey found that consumers' willingness rose by 3.7 points
to minus 12.3 points.


And households are more optimistic with regard to their future
income than they have been in five and a half years, with that
sub-index rising by 10.1 points to plus 13 points.


The economic expectations sub-index slipped by 0.2 points to 53.1
points, GfK found.
