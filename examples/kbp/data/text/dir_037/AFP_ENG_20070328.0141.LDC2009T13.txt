Turkish diplomats may meet with 15 British military personnel
detained by Iran, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan
said Wednesday, the Anatolia news agency reported.


Erdogan was speaking to reporters after meeting Iranian Foreign
Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of an Arab League
summit in Riyadh.


He said to "expect a positive development at any moment" in the
crisis between the two countries, Anatolia said.


Asked if there was a possibility Turkish diplomats could meet the
15 captives, Erdogan replied: "There is."


The British Foreign Office was unable to confirm whether such a
meeting might take place and warned that the claim should be
treated with "caution."


"For the moment, the point is that we want access to them," a
Foreign Office spokesman said.


Britain was set to offer evidence Wednesday that its sailors and
marines being held by Iran were wrongly seized in Iraqi waters,
reports said, raising the stakes in the mounting stand-off with
Tehran.
