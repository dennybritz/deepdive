China has issued new rules intended to weed out "dead souls" and
other so-called employees at government departments who earn
salaries despite not doing any work, state press reported
Wednesday.


Government departments around the country often pay more out in
wages than they should, with far too many employees sitting
around doing nothing or continuing to be paid after they have
retired, the China Daily said.


"In some cases, former staff members' families receive their
salary after they have died," the paper said, referring to the
"dead souls" phenomenon.


Following the introduction of the new rules, which were unveiled
on Tuesday, the central government has urged people who know of
any job frauds to report cases to local authorities or ring a
special hotline.


Aside from the "dead souls," another high-profile problem is the
creation of far more plum positions than are required.


"In some places a director even has a dozen deputies," the paper
cited Wu Zhilun, a senior official with Ministry of Supervision,
as saying.


The new rules state that "heavy punishments" will be dealt out to
government departments, although the China Daily gave no details.
