Sri Lanka Wednesday set up a telephone hot line to receive
information about aircraft operated by Tamil Tiger rebels after
they staged their first aerial strike against the military.


President Mahinda Rajapakse initiated the dedicated telephone
number manned by the military as an early warning system about
intruding rebel aircraft, a spokesman for his office said.


"The toll free telephone number 116 is dedicated to receive
information about suspicious flying activity," the spokesman
said.


On Tuesday, the president said the Tamil Tigers' acquisition of
aircraft could be a threat to South Asian security.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on Monday flew over
the main military air base and escaped unscathed after dropping
several bombs that killed three airmen and wounded 16 in addition
to damaging two parked aircraft.


Rajapakse has also ordered an investigation into the major
security lapses that allowed the attack -- which has seriously
embarrassed the island's defence establishment -- to take place
even though the planes were spotted on radar.


The Tigers possess at least two Czech-built Zlin-143 single-
engine four-seater aircraft and an airfield.


Despite a February 2002 truce arranged by peace broker Norway,
both the Tigers and government forces have been locked in a new
wave of fighting since December 2005.
