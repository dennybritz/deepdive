Growth of the eurozone money supply, as measured by the broad
indicator M3, rose to a record high point in February, data
showed on Wednesday, reinforcing prospects of a further rise in
interest rates in coming months.


M3 growth stood at 10.0 percent on an annualised basis in
February, the highest level since the start of monetary union, up
from 9.9 percent in January, the ECB said in a statement.


M3 covers cash, overnight deposits, other short-term deposits,
repurchase agreements, shares and units in money market funds and
debt securities with a maturity of up to two years and is the
ECB's preferred indicator of medium-term inflationary trends in
the eurozone economy.


Because the monthly figures are subject to volatility, the ECB
also calculates a three-month moving average for M3 growth, which
accelerated to 9.9 percent in the period from December to
February from 9.7 percent in the period from November to January,
the ECB said.
