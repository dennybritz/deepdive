Media moguls were top of Australia's executive rich list released
Wednesday but mining managers benefitting from the country's
resources boom were also represented.


Australian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch topped BRW magazine's
first executive rich list, which ranks the managers of the
country's top 500 public companies according to the value of
their shareholdings.


The News Corp. Ltd executive chairman holds an 11.5 billion
dollar (9.3 billion US) shareholding, well ahead of nearest
challenger James Packer who has a 4.9 billion dollar stake in his
group.


Packer has been in charge of media and gaming company Publishing
and Broadcasting Ltd. since the death of his father Kerry Packer
in December 2005.


Third in line was the founder of the Westfield shopping centre
group Frank Lowy with a 3.6 billion dollar stake and fourth was
Fortescue Metals Group boss Andrew Forrest with a shareholding
worth 1.9 billion dollars.


BRW said the mining boom meant 39 of the top 200 executives were
in the resources sector.


"The incredible impact of the resources sector on the Australian
economy is highlighted by the executive rich," BRW said.


"On average, the resources companies produced share price growth
of 136.7 percent in the last twelve months. Junior copper miner
CuDeco recorded share price growth of 1,000 per cent."
