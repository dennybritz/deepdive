Australian police Wednesday arrested a Hong Kong man over the
seizure of cocaine worth some 68 million dollars (55 million US)
-- one of the largest hauls of the drug in the country's history.


Asian crime officers seized 141 kilograms (310 pounds) of cocaine
at Sydney Airport on March 15 after Customs officials discovered
the white powder hidden within the sub-frame of a crate
containing a water purifier.


"This is the fifth largest seizure of cocaine in Australia," the
Australian Customs Service said in a statement.


The crate was one of two carrying large water purifying equipment
which were shipped by air from Hong Kong and delivered to a
business premises in Sydney's inner west.


Police arrested a 59-year-old Hong Kong man at the business late
on Tuesday after he opened the crates.


He has been arrested and charged with importing and attempting to
possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, officials said. The
charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
