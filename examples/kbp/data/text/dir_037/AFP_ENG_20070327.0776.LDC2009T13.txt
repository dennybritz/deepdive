Chip giant Intel Corp will help establish a semiconductor
training site to support its planned 2.5-billion-dollar wafer
plant in the northeast Chinese city of Dalian, state media
reported Wednesday.


With a total investment of 348 million yuan (45 million dollars)
the facility will begin training enrollees on semiconductor
manufacturing when it opens in August 2008 to provide skilled
personnel for the chip plant, the China Daily newspaper reported.


"With the Intel investment, Dalian will not only become the
largest manufacturing base for semiconductor chips but also the
most advanced training base in the country," Dalian Mayor Xia
Deren was quoted as saying during a signing ceremony for the
project on Tuesday.


Intel announced on Monday its plans for the wafer plant, the
first of its kind for the company and a sign of a potential shift
for China from low-end manufacturing to high-tech output.


The training facility will be jointly set up by Intel, Dalian's
municipal government, and the Dalian University of Technology
(DUT), and managed by the university.


Intel will donate an 8-inch chip production line for training
purposes, the paper said.


Construction will begin later this year, Xia said.


"The development of a strong education base and an excellent
training environment will provide an important platform to the
city and the northeast to enhance their base of innovation,"
Intel China President Wee Theng Tan said.
