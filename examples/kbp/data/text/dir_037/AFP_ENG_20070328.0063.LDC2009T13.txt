The death toll from a suicide truck bombing and a car bombing in
the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar has risen to 75 dead, a
hospital doctor said on Wednesday.


The medic at Tal Afar hospital said overall 75 people were killed
in the attacks and another 190 people were wounded in Tuesday's
attacks, which occurred within minutes of each other.


The attacks were the deadliest in the mixed Shiite-Sunni town
since US President George W. Bush in March 2006 held up the
onetime militant stronghold as a model for coalition efforts to
create a stable Iraq.
