Australia's women's water polo team has lodged an official
complaint alleging an Italian opponent bit their star player Kate
Gynther.


The incident apparently happened in Australia's 12-8 victory over
the Olympic champions at the world championships here Tuesday and
is not isolated, said coach Greg McFadden.


"They just fall over the top and they bite. There are three girls
in the team who do it all the time," he claimed, adding that
Gynther was bitten on the forearm and the skin was broken.


"The referees can't see it. It's pretty hard to see because a lot
happens underwater, so we've got to write an official complaint
about it and we will."


Gynther said she was shocked at the tactics.


"It was a bit of a surprise, it is something you don't expect to
happen but I definitely felt it," she said, adding that she
considered lashing out but refrained.


"There was a bit of that feeling but in the game I went to the
bench and that calmed me down a bit.


"There is a lot that goes on, people are pulling and kicking and
stuff like that goes on but you can't defend yourself against
(biting).


"It is not good for the sport. We don't get much publicity and
then it is only when someone gets bitten."


The Italian team could not be reached for comment.
