Japanese share prices closed down 0.64 percent on Wednesday,
depressed by a slump in Asian equities and a stronger yen against
the US dollar, dealers said.


They said trade was cautious as the market waited a testimony
later in the day by US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and
the release of Japanese economic data on Friday.


Higher oil prices driven by tensions between the West and Iran
also dampened sentiment.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 110.32 points to 17,254.73.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section eased 12.80 points or 0.74 percent to 1,711.06.
