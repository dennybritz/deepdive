A suicide attacker blew himself up close to an intelligence
service vehicle Wednesday in the Afghan capital Kabul and
casualties were feared, police said.


The Taliban-style bombing took place during rush hour in the city
centre near many government and business buildings, Kabul
criminal investigation police chief General Ali Shah Paktiawal
told AFP.


"The suicide attacker targeted an intelligence vehicle, at this
stage I can only confirm that the attacker has died, we are
verifying casualties now," Paktiawal said.


Paktiawal blamed the attack on "enemies of people," a term often
used to refer to Taliban militants who were ousted from power in
late 2001 by US-led invasion of Afghanistan and have since waged
a bloody insurgency.


Kabul however has seen few of the suicide attacks that have
rocked the rest of the country.
