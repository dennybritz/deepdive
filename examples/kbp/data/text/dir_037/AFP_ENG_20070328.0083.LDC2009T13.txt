Japan on Wednesday launched a new, elite military unit to counter
terrorism and assist with the country's growing defence role
overseas.


The 3,200-strong "Combat Readiness Force" was formed some two
months after officially pacifist Japan created its first full-
fledged defence ministry since World War II.


The force will include specialists on biochemical weapons and a
sub-unit, to be operational by March next year, that can be
deployed to face terrorist attacks against Japanese cities.


It will also train troops on peacekeeping missions and serve as
an advance team for deployments overseas.


Japan in January upgraded overseas operations to consider them a
core mission of the armed forces. Deployments abroad had earlier
been considered "extraordinary," meaning that each one needed
parliamentary approval.


Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet on Tuesday approved the first
deployment since the change, sending a handful of defence
personnel to help monitor the ceasefire ending Nepal's civil war.


Abe has sought a larger military role for Japan and wants to
rewrite the pacifist constitution imposed by the United States
after World War II.
