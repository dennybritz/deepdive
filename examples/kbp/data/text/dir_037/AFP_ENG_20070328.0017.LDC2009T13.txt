The United States welcomed Indonesia's decision to lift a ban on
sharing bird flu samples with the World Health Organisation, an
official said Wednesday.


"We welcome the government of Indonesia's announcement that it
will immediately resume the sharing of influenza virus samples,"
US Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt said in a
statement issued in Jakarta.


"Responding to a pandemic will demand the cooperation of the
world community, as no nation can go it alone," he said after the
ban was lifted Tuesday.


Indonesia, the country worst hit by bird flu, stopped sending
samples to the World Health Organisation (WHO) over concerns drug
firms would end up using them to develop costly vaccines beyond
poorer countries' budgets.


Sample-sharing is said to allow experts to track the evolution of
the disease and better tackle the virus.


Firms will now need permission from a country for access to its
virus samples, under a deal agreed with the WHO after two days of
international talks in Jakarta.


Some 69 people have died in Indonesia from bird flu out of 89
confirmed infections. Most cases have occurred after contact with
sick birds.


The WHO says the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus has infected 282
people and killed 169 of them, mostly in Southeast Asia, since
the end of 2003.


Scientists worry the virus could mutate into a form easily spread
among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to
kill millions.
