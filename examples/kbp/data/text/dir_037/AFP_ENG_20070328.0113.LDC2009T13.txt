Gunmen holding 31 pre-schoolers and two teachers inside a bus in
the Philippines capital have agreed to free the hostages and
surrender at 7:00pm (1100 GMT), police and negotiators said
Wednesday.


"He will just let the hostages go and give himself up," police
spokesman Chief Superintendent Cipriano Querol said over local
television, referring to Amando "Jun" Ducat, head of a Manila
pre-school who hijacked a bus and held hostage a group of
students and teachers.


In exchange, police agreed to let the press cover the surrender.


"We acceded to that condition. We assured him that he will be in
safe hands after he surrenders and that nothing will happen to
him," Querol said.


Action movie star senator Ramon Revilla, who helped negotiate the
release of one child out of 34 people held by the gunmen, said
Ducat asked that candles be lit at dusk, when he surrenders.


"He wants the area around him to light up," Revilla told
reporters. "He said the candles would symbolise enlightenment."


Claiming to be armed with guns and grenades, Ducat and two
associates seized 32 children and two teachers they had tricked
into joining a field trip.


The bus was diverted to a street near the Manila city hall, where
the suspects demanded free education and housing for 145 students
at a pre-school that Ducat runs, including the hostages, in the
city's depressed Tondo district.


One of the children was later freed unharmed and taken to
hospital to be treated for fever.
