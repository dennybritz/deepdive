PetroChina Co Ltd estimated the reserves of a recently discovered
oil field at 2.2 billion barrels (297.3 million tonnes), China's
biggest oil discovery in 10 years, state media reported
Wednesday.


The daily output of the newly found oil field, located in Bohai
Bay region in offshore northeastern China, is likely to reach
200,800 barrels in three years, the Xinhua news agency said,
citing unnamed sources with the company.


Zhang Anping, a spokesman of PetroChina, declined to comment,
when contacted by AFP.


Han Xuegong, a Beijing-based professor with CNPC Managers
Training Institute confirmed that the discovery is the largest in
a decade.


China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country's top oil and
gas producer, is the parent of Hong Kong-listed PetroChina.


"This is the biggest oil discovery in 10 years... Oil output from
the oil field could exceed what PetroChina's drilled from Tarim
Basin, which was discovered in the 1980s," Han said.


PetroChina will announce details about the oil field in May or
June, Xinhua said.


China's consumption of crude oil and refined products in 2006 hit
346.6 million tonnes, up 9.3 percent from the previous year,
according to figures released by the Ministry of Commerce in
February.
