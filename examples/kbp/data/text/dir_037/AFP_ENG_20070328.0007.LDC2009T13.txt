Hong Kong share prices finished the morning session sharply lower
Wednesday, shedding 1.24 percent, following falls on Wall Street
overnight after weak economic indicators renewed worries over the
United States economy, dealers said.


They said blue chips such as HSBC and China Mobile were also
pressured by trade related to the expiry of March futures
contracts on Thursday.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended the morning down 244.05
points at 19,462.74, just off the session's low of 19,459.19.
