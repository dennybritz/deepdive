Two more major garment factories in the US-administered Northern
Mariana Islands have said they will close in the face of
increased foreign competition in the US market.


Michigan Inc said on Tuesday it would close on Friday, putting
150 migrant workers -- mostly Chinese -- out of work.


Grace International Inc. also said it would close its factory by
April 7, leaving 100 migrant workers without jobs.


Grace production manager Kam Wing Tam said the factory had to
close because of steadily declining orders from their buyers in
the United States.


The two announcements bring to 15 the number of factories which
have closed in the western Pacific territory since liberalization
of world textile trade rules in 2005.


Garments from the Northern Marianas are being squeezed out of the
US market because greater quantities were allowed in from cheaper
manufacturers in countries such as China and Vietnam.


Commerce Department data showed the value of garments exported
from the Northern Marianas last year fell 25.2 percent from 2005
to 486.5 million dollars.


In 1999, garment production in the main island Saipan was a
billion-dollar industry, contributing as much as 82 million
dollars in direct and indirect taxes to the government of the
archipelago of around 82,000 people.


The remaining garment manufactures in Saipan are hoping the US
will amend its trade laws to reduce the local content requirement
of garments imported from the Northern Marianas from 50 percent
to 30 percent.


This would put the territory on the same footing as countries
with which the US has free trade agreements.
