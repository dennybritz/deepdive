Japanese share prices rose 0.16 percent in morning trade
Wednesday on a technical rebound from a slump on Tuesday, finding
enough support to offset more disappointing US economic data,
dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares was
up 28.06 points to 17,393.11 by the lunch break after breaking a
five-day winning streak Tuesday.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section gained 2.29 points or 0.13 percent to 1,726.15.
