The European Union on Wednesday kickstarted membership talks with
Turkey, which have been at a standstill since June, an EU
diplomat said.


EU ambassadors agreed that Turkey could begin negotiations,
probably on Thursday, on one of the 35 policy chapters that each
aspiring country must complete to join the rich European club.


The chapter concerns "enterprise and industry policy", the
diplomat said, on condition of anonymity.


The move comes three months after the EU froze eight of the
chapters to punish the government in Ankara for its failure to
fully extend its customs agreement with the bloc to EU member
country Cyprus.


Turkey's membership talks, begun in October 2005, have been
plagued by difficulties and the only policy chapter to be opened
so far was "science and research" in June.


Turkey refuses to open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot
traffic until the EU lives up to its pledge to end the isolation
of the Turkish Cypriot statelet in the north of the island, which
is recognised only by Ankara.


Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkey seized its northern third
in response to an Athens-engineered coup in Nicosia aimed at
uniting the island with Greece.
