Chinese share prices fell 1.39 percent in Wednesday morning trade
as investors booked profits after a seven-day winning run that
drove stocks to record highs, dealers said.


They said prices touched new highs before a round of profit-
taking set in with investors focused on automakers and airlines
amid concerns about the potential for higher global fuel costs as
tensions over Iran pushed oil ahead.


However investor sentiment remained positive amid expectations
fresh funds and a set of strong corporate earnings will see
stocks move higher still.


"It's normal to see such a correction after the gains posted over
the past seven consecutive days," said Shen Jun, an analyst at
Shangzhenglian Consulting.


"However the overall bullish trend is unlikely to be disrupted by
these corrections as market fundamentals are still solid and fund
inflows remain strong."


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
down 43.70 points at 3,095.12.


The Shanghai A-share Index lost 45.83 points or 1.39 percent to
3,252.52 while Shenzhen A-share Index shed 26.97 points or 3.07
percent at 852.02.
