Japanese share prices rose 0.16 percent in morning trade
Wednesday on a technical rebound from a slump on Tuesday, finding
enough support to offset more disappointing US economic data,
dealers said.


They said trade was cautious as the market waited for testimony
later in the day by US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and
Japanese economic data on Friday.


Higher oil prices driven by tensions between the West and Iran
also dampened sentiment.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares was
up 28.06 points to 17,393.11 by the lunch break after breaking a
five-day winning streak Tuesday.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section gained 2.29 points or 0.13 percent to 1,726.15.


Gainers led decliners 939 to 621, with 158 stocks flat.


Volume was 1.04 billion shares, up from 862 million Tuesday
morning.


Relatively active trading by foreign investors contributed to the
volume increase, dealers said.


"Given recent rises in crude oil prices, market players are keen
to hear what Bernanke will say about the risks of inflation. They
are focused on whether he will make a comforting statement about
the outlook for the US economy," said Hiroichi Nishi, general
manager of equities information at Nikko Cordial Securities.


Oil-related stocks led the gainers, with Nippon Oil up 18 yen or
1.9 percent at 963 and Cosmo Oil up 12 yen or 2.44 percent at
503. Inpex gained 38,000 yen or 3.9 percent at 1.01 mln.


Exporters were mostly lower, hurt by a firmer yen.


Toyota Motor dipped 50 yen or 0.65 percent to 7,680, Nissan Motor
slipped 10 yen or 0.77 percent to 1,287 and Sony fell 90 yen or
1.45 percent to 6,120.
