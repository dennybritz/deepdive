Flaming space junk from a Russian satellite narrowly missed
hitting a Chilean airliner over the Pacific Ocean, reports said
Wednesday.


The pilot of a LAN Chile Airbus A340 en route to New Zealand told
air traffic controllers he had seen pieces of flaming space junk
falling about eight kilometres (four miles) in front of the plane
and behind it, TV3 said.


The aircraft was not struck by any of the debris and later landed
safely in Auckland.


Airways New Zealand, which manages New Zealand's air traffic,
said it had been warned by Russian authorities that an obsolete
satellite was due to fall into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday.


But the debris had apparently fallen into the area 12 hours
earlier than the time advised by the Russians.


A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority, which is
responsible for air safety, said it would launch an inquiry after
it was advised of the details of the incident.
