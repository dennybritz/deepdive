Beijing has banned sending pornographic text messages or pictures
via mobile phones after busting phone dealers who sold mass-
storage devices containing porn, state media reported Wednesday.


Violators face fines of up to 3,000 yuan (385 dollars) and two
weeks in detention, Xinhua news agency reported, quoting city
public security authorities.


Those who sell such content face jail terms between six months
and three years, it said.


In the past three weeks, Beijing police have arrested 19 second-
hand mobile phone dealers who were found selling storage devices
containing pornographic pictures or films.


The chips can hold an hour-long film and were being sold for only
five or six yuan (about 60 to 80 cents) each, a security official
told Xinhua.


Pornography in any form is banned in China but state media
reports have signalled a rise in porn traffic as Internet and
mobile phone use increases.


China has 461 million mobile phone subscribers and 137 million
people online, the second-largest number of Internet users in the
world after the United States.
