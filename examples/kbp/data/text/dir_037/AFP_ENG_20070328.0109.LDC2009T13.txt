A Palestinian militant was killed by Israeli troops in a pre-dawn
raid in the northern West Bank on Wednesday, Palestinian security
sources said.


Iyad Abu Khateb, 19, a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades
that is loosely linked to president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah faction,
was killed during an army operation in the Jenin refugee camp,
they said.


"A unit operating in the sector spotted a group of armed men and
opened fire in their direction. One of the men was hit," an army
spokesman said.


He added that the army had arrested 37 wanted Palestinian
militants in the West Bank.


Abu Khateb's death brings to 5,651 the number of people killed
since the launch of the intifada in 2000, the vast majority of
them Palestinians, according to an AFP count.


Later Wednesday, Palestinian militants fired two rockets from the
Gaza Strip, which struck near the southern coastal city of
Ashkelon without causing casualties. The Islamic Jihad group
claimed responsibility for the firing.
