Hundreds of Israeli police armed with batons moved into an
abandoned settlement in the West Bank on Wednesday to clear about
300 settlers occupying the site, an AFP photographer said.


Helmeted police had to drag out some of the right-wing Jewish
settlers who had moved this week into the ruins of Homesh, which
had been cleared as part of Israel's so-called disengagement plan
in 2005.


The settlers, mostly youths, marched on the hilltop settlement
under army protection on Monday vowing to reoccupy Homesh and
rebuild homes razed by Israeli troops a year and a half ago.


Then prime minister Ariel Sharon evacuated Homesh and three other
West Bank settlements as part of the now-defunct plan for a
partial withdrawal from the territory Israel has occupied since
1967.


Homesh, which was established as a military outpost in 1978, was
turned over to settlers in 1980. Many of its 70 families were
pious and militant zealots who believed they were doing God's
work resettling their biblical homeland of Samaria.


Israeli peace groups have blasted the army for caving into right-
wing threats and allowing the march on the evacuated settlement.


The West Bank settlements were cleared the same year that Israel
also evacuated 21 settlements and all army outposts from the Gaza
Strip after a 38-year occupation.
