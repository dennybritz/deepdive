Yemen downed an unmanned Iranian spy plane after it entered its
airspace a week ago, local media reported on Wednesday.


The air defence force brought down the plane last Wednesday after
it flew into Yemeni airspace over the Arabian Sea, the
independent Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper reported, citing sources in
the southern province of Hadramut.


There was no official confirmation of the report.


Tension is mounting around the world over accusations that Iran
is using its nuclear programme to secretly develop an atomic
weapon, a charge it vehemently denies.


Some pro-Western states in the Gulf region fear being sucked into
a military conflict between the United States and Iran if
concerns over the nuclear programme are not peacefully resolved.


The UN Security Council on Saturday imposed new economic and
trade sanctions on Iran after the country ignored repeated
ultimatums to suspend uranium enrichment.


The UN resolution blocks all Iranian arms exports and freezes the
overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions
linked to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
