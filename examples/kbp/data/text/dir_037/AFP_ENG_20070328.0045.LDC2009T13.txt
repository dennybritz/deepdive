A Palestinian militant was killed by Israeli troops staging a
raid in the northern West Bank before dawn on Wednesday,
Palestinian security sources said.


Iyad Abu Khateb, 19, a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades
which is loosely linked to president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah
faction, was killed during an Israeli military operation on the
Jenin refugee camp, they said.


"A unit operating in the sector spotted a group of armed men and
opened fire in their direction. One of the men was hit," an army
spokesman said.


He added that the army had arrested 37 wanted palestinian
militants in the West Bank.


The death brings to 5,651 the number of people killed since the
launch of the intifada in September 2000,  most of them
Palestinians, according to an AFP count.
