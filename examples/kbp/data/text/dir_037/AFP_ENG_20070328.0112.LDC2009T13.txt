Gunmen holding 31 pre-schoolers and two teachers inside a bus in
the Philippines capital have agreed to free the hostages and
surrender at 7:00pm (1100 GMT), police and negotiators said
Wednesday.


"He will just let the hostages go and give himself up," police
spokesman Chief Superintendent Cipriano Querol said over local
television, referring to Amando "Jun" Ducat, head of a Manila
pre-school who hijacked a bus and held hostage a group of
students and teachers.


In exchange, police agreed to let the press cover the surrender.


"We acceded to that condition. We assured him that he will be in
safe hands after he surrenders and that nothing will happen to
him," Querol said.
