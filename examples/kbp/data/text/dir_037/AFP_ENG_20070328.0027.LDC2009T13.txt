Tarence Kinsey scored a season-high 24 points and Rudy Gay added
20 and 12 rebounds as Memphis slowed down Kobe Bryant and posted
an 88-86 win over the Los Angeles Lakers Tuesday.


Last Thursday, Bryant blitzed Memphis for 60 points on 20-of-37
shooting for Los Angeles in a 121-119 triumph.


The league's leading scorer entered having scored 40-plus points
in his last five National Basketball Association games, including
four 50-plus efforts.


But Bryant and his teammates were cooled off by league-worst
Memphis, which held Bryant to just 23 points on a dismal seven-
of-26 shooting.


In the fourth quarter, Kinsey broke an 81-81 tied with his three-
pointer from the wing and added two free throws as the Grizzlies
built a five-point advantage with 13 seconds left.


Lamar Odom recorded his fourth straight double-double for Los
Angeles, which has just a two-game lead over Denver (35-34) for
sixth place in the Western Conference standings.
