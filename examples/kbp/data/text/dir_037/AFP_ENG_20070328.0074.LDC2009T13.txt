Sri Lankan troops Wednesday captured a key Tamil Tiger rebel
stronghold in the island's embattled eastern region, the military
said.


Troops took control of Kokkadichcholai in the district of
Batticaloa and seized a large haul of arms, ammunition and land
mines from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) base, the
army said in a statement.


"Marking one more milestone in the army's forward march to secure
the besieged eastern areas from LTTE clutches, valiant troops
this morning completely brought Kokkadichcholai under their
control," the statement said.


It gave no details of casualties.


The statement came a day after Tamil Tiger rebels drove a
tractor-trailer loaded with explosives to an army camp in the
same district, killing eight people.


On Monday, Tigers flew single-engined planes over the main
military air base adjacent to Sri Lanka's only international
airport and dropped bombs, killing three airmen, in the group's
first ever air raid.


More than 60,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's Tamil
separatist campaign since 1972. The two sides agreed to a truce
in February 2002, but subsequent peace talks have broken down.
