Powerful explosions were heard in the Sri Lankan capital early
Sunday and security forces fired tracer bullets into the air amid
fears of a Tamil Tiger attack.


Troops manning key positions in the capital lit up the night sky
with anti- aircraft fire following reports that Tiger planes had
entered the city's air space, official sources said.


Residents heard huge explosions as key military installations
began firing anti- aircraft guns, and authorities switched off
the power, plunging the city into darkness.
