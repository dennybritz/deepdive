Kei Igawa came out of the bullpen in the first inning on Saturday
and notched his best performance as a New York Yankee, pitching
six scoreless innings in a 3-1 win over the Boston Red Sox.


The victory snapped a seven-game losing streak, and denied bitter
American League East rivals Boston a fourth win in five games
over the Yankees.


Japan's Igawa, who was signed to five-year, 20 million dollar
contract in December, began the day with a 7.84 ERA and nine
walks in 20 2-3 innings.


Relegated to relief duty after his last start, Igawa came on to
relieve Jeff Karstens, who left the game after facing just two
batters.


Karstens, making just his eighth major league start, was hit in
the knee by a line drive by Julio Lugo on his first pitch. After
a single by Kevin Youkilis, Karstens was replaced by Igawa.


Igawa allowed two hits and four walks in six innings. He struck
out six and left with a 3-0 lead.


Jorge Posada hit a two-run home run in the fourth off Red Sox
starter Tim Wakefield to give New York a 2-0 lead. Posada scored
on a ground-rule double by Melky Cabrera in the sixth to make it
3-0.


Mariano Rivera allowed a hit in the ninth to pick up his first
save of the season. The legendary closer had been struggling of
late and was 0-2 with a 30.38 ERA in his last four appearances.
