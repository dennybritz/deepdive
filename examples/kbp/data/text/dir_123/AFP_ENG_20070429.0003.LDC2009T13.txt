China's central bank on Sunday ordered major commercial banks to
set aside more money in reserves in an effort to slow its economy
after higher-than-expected first-quarter growth figures.


The People's Bank of China announced the hike in the required
reserve ratio  to 11 percent a little more than a week after the
government unveiled 11.1 percent economic growth in the first
three months of the year.


The world's fourth-largest economy is fueled by a potent mix of
exports and investments, and monetary measures such as this are
meant to reduce the country's liquidity, which drives the massive
spending on new investment projects.
