Bangladesh's military-backed government signed a deal with
Myanmar to build the first road linking the Bay of Bengal
neighbours as part of efforts to expand trade, a statement said
Sunday.


Bangladesh signed the deal Saturday in the Myanmar capital,
Yangon, and will finance the 25-kilometre (18-mile) road from its
southeastern border city of Ramu to Baulibazar in Myanmar, the
statement released in the capital, Dhaka, said.


The two countries share a 300 kilometre-long border divided by
the Naf river.


Bangladesh's government, which cancelled planned polls and
imposed a state of emergency in January in response to political
unrest, has said it aimed to increase regional trade as part of
sweeping reforms before new elections are called sometime in late
2008.


Myanmar military leaders have held power since elections in 1990
won by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were
nullified.


Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. She has
repeatedly been placed under house arrest and occasionally freed
under international pressure. In 2003, she was arrested again and
remains locked in her home.
