A general election is to be held in Ireland on May 24, a
spokeswoman for Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said on Sunday.


In a surprise early morning move Ahern sought the dissolution of
the country's 29th Dail (lower house of parliament) by President
Mary McAleese at her official residence on the outskirts of
Dublin.


The president leaves later on Sunday for a five day visit to the
United States.


Ahern, who has been in power at the head of two administrations
since 1997, is facing an uphill struggle to get a record third
term according to opinion polls.
