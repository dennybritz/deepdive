Tamil Tiger aircraft bombed two key installations in and around
Sri Lanka's capital in retaliation for a military air strike
against their territory early Sunday, a rebel spokesman told AFP.


Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam planes targeted two oil storage
facilities, spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said.


"We sent two squadrons to target facilities that provide fuel to
military aircraft after two Sri Lankan airforce jets bombed a
suburb of Kilinochchi (inside rebel-held territory) just past
midnight," he said.
