The 2007 World Cup final ended in complete farce here on Saturday
when Australia celebrated victory over Sri Lanka before the game
had officially been declared as over.


With Sri Lanka struggling to reach the revised target of 269, the
batsmen went off for bad light but despite the celebrations of
the Australians, the umpires insisted that the last three overs
be bowled despite the gloom at the Kensington Oval.
