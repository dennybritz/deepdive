Britain's Ministry of Defence confirmed news reports Sunday that
the body parts of British airmen killed in the crash of a
reconnaissance plane in Afghanistan had been put in the wrong
coffins.


An MoD spokesman said there had been a "regrettable incident" but
that families of the dead had been made aware of the mix-up in
time for it to be sorted out for the funerals.


Trish Knight, whose 25-year-old son Ben was among those killed,
was quoted in The Observer weekly as saying she had thought of
cancelling her son's funeral and raised concerns of a wider
problem.


The Observer said the error occurred after a Nimrod
reconnaissance aircraft, suffering from an apparent technical
fault, crashed near Kandahar in September last year, killing 14
airmen, a soldier and a Marine.


The men's bodies were returned home in a moving repatriation
ceremony at the Royal Air Force base at Kinloss in Scotland.


But the Observer reported that at least one victim's body parts
had ended up in the coffin of another.


"We don't know how many mistakes were made over this but body
parts were found in a wrong coffin and there may well have been
more parts mixed up,"    the mother of Ben Knight told the
weekly.


"We just thought 'how can we go ahead if we are not sure if it's
Ben's body in there or maybe somebody else's?'" she added.
