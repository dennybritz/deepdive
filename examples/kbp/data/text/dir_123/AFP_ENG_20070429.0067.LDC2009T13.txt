A French woman freed by the Taliban after 24 days held as a
hostage has returned to France overnight, the French embassy in
Kabul said Sunday.


"She went back to France during the night," the embassy told AFP,
after it earlier said she had not yet left the country.


The matter had been treated with "due discretion," it said,
identifying the woman as Celine Cordelier, aged between 20 and
30.


The embassy would not release details of where she had flown to
or who had transported her.


She was released Saturday, but a second French national and three
Afghans who were abducted with her on April 3 remain in
captivity.


They all work for the non-government organisation Terre d'Enfance
(A World For Our Children) which runs a small children's
programme in Zaranj, near the border with Iran.


In a statement Saturday, the Taliban said they wanted France's
1,000 troops in Afghanistan to leave, or a response from the
government about an "exchange of prisoners."


They gave authorities a week to respond.
