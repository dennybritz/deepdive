Juan Diaz kept his undefeated string intact recording an eighth
round technical knockout over Acelino Freitas to hold onto his
World Boxing Association lightweight title.


The 23-year-old Diaz boosted his record to 32-0 with 16 KOs while
Freitas dropped to 38-2 following Saturday's bout at the Foxwoods
Resort Casino.


Diaz was the more aggressive of the two and hurt Freitas with
blows in the fifth and eighth. Brazilian Freitas quit in between
the eighth and ninth round rather than suffer more punishment.


Freitas was looking for his fourth straight win after losing his
title in embarrassing fashion to Diego Corrales in August 2004.


Freitas quit in the middle of the 10th round of that lopsided
encounter.
