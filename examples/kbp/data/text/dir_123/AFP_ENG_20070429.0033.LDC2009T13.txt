A series of loud detonations could be heard in southwest Baghdad
on Sunday during what Iraqi security officials described as a
joint Iraqi-US operation in support of the city's security plan.


Shockwaves rumbled over the city and blasts were audible 15
kilometres (nine miles) away in the heart of the war-torn
capital, which has seen no let up in insurgent bomb attacks
despite the 10-week-old old operation.


Brigadier General Qassim Atta, spokesman for the Iraqi forces
involved in the plan, told state television that the blasts were
the result of a joint operation, but did not say what was causing
them.


Security and defence officials told AFP that US forces were at
the origin of the detonations, but did not say whether they were
artillery or air strikes.
