A Pakistani solider and three suspected militants were killed
during a pre-dawn exchange of fire Sunday in a restive tribal
area bordering Afghanistan, officials said.


The soldier was killed when suspected militants fired rockets and
small arms fire at a military post in Nori Dogg village of
lawless North Waziristan tribal district, a security official
told AFP.


Three militants were killed when troops returned fire, the
official said.


Militants linked to Afghanistan's ousted Taliban militia
regularly attack Pakistani troops in the area despite a peace
deal in September last year.


Four militant bomb-makers were killed Friday in a blast at a
house in Saidgai village in North Waziristan, a known Al-Qaeda
and Taliban hotspot.


In late 2005 a top Egyptian Al-Qaeda explosives expert, Hamza
Rabia, was killed in an explosion in North Waziristan.
