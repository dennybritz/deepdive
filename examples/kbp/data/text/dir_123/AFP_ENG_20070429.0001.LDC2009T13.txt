Japanese chemists have devised a gel that swells up to 500 times
its size when in contact with solvents, an invention hailed as a
breakthrough for absorbing dangerous industrial spills.


The jelly-like substance is a successor to polyelectrolyte gels,
which expand when in contact with water and are best known in
nappies, also called diapers.


Polyelectrolyte gels, though, are useless in tackling organic, or
carbon-based, solvents.


Their structure typically collapses because of the aggregation of
charged atoms in such compounds, the only exceptions being
"polar" solvents that are particularly water-loving.


A team led by Kazuki Sada of Kyushu University found a way around
these by adding tetra-alkylammonium tetraphenylborate, a
substance that attracts less- polar solvents.


The gel has been successfully tested on carbon tetrachloride,
toluene, tetrahydrofuran and other common industrial solvents.
Their work is published online on Sunday by the journal Nature
Materials.
