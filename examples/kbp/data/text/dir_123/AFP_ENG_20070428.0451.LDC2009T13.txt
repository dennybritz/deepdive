Australia beat Sri Lanka by 53  runs on the Duckworth/Lewis
method to win the World Cup Final here Saturday.


Victory at Kensington Oval gave Australia an unprecedented third
straight World Cup Final win and fourth in all, the most by one
country in the tournament's nine-edition history stretching back
to 1975.


But the game ended in farce with Australia thinking the match had
been called off after 33 overs of Sri Lanka's innings only for
the game to resume in pitch- black conditions on a ground without
floodlights.


Wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist's 149, the highest individual score
in a final, beating the unbeaten 140 made by Australia captain
Ricky Ponting against India in Johannesburg four years ago, was
the centrepiece of the champions' 281 for four in an innings
reduced by rain to 38 overs.


In reply Sri Lanka, the 1996 champions and making their second
final appearance, were given a glimmer of hope by a second-wicket
stand of 117 between Sanath Jayasuriya (63) and Kumar Sangakkara
(54).


Chasing a revised target of 269 in 36 overs after a second rain
delay, they finished on 215 for eight.


Gilchrist, Ponting and fast bowler Glenn McGrath, in his last
match before retirement, became the only three players to appear
in three World Cup-winning teams after also starring in
Australia's 1999 and 2003 triumphs.
