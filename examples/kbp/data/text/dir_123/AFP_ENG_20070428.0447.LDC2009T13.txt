Five people were wounded when Sri Lankan troops fired anti-
aircraft guns at suspected Tamil Tiger planes that entered
Colombo's air space, doctors said.


The five victims were brought to the Colombo National Hospital
with bullet injuries, said director Hector Weerasinghe.


"All five have gunshot injuries and they seem to be a result of
friendly fire," Weerasinghe told AFP.


Security forces lit up the night sky with tracer bullets and
high-calibre anti- aircraft guns following reports that two light
aircraft belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were
flying over the capital.
