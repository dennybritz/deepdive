England's Luke Donald maintained his one-shot lead in the 6.3
million-dollar Byron Nelson Championship on Saturday with a
3-under 67 third round.


Donald shrugged off a slow start, picking up three strokes on the
back nine for a 10-under 54-hole total of 200.


He also stretched his streak of rounds in the 60s in this
tournament to 11.


Dallas-born Scott Verplank (66) was in second place at 9-under
201, with Michael Allen (64) another shot back in third.


England's Ian Poulter (65) was in fourth place on 204, while Phil
Mickelson (66) and Vijay Singh (69) were among a group on 205
that also included Japan's Ryuji Imada.


Donald made his big move with three birdies in four holes
starting at the 13th, but a bogey at the par-3 17th, where he
pulled his tee shot into a bunker, cut his lead.


Play was suspended for one minute late in the round to honor
former tournament host Byron Nelson, who died seven months ago.
