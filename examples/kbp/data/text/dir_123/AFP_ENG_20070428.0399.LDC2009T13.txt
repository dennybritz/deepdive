The Estonian police have been swamped with calls from would-be
volunteer constables after appealing for help in restoring order
in Tallinn following two nights of riots, a spokeswoman said
Saturday.


"Since the announcement on Saturday that we were looking for
volunteers, the phones have been ringing all the time," police
spokeswoman Marge Kohtla told AFP.


"Both Estonians and Russians have offered their assistance," she
said.


Registration for the volunteer force will begin Sunday, said
Kohtla, who was assigned to the capital from the southern county
of Valga where she is based, to help deal with the rioting in
Tallinn, triggered by a row between Russians and Estonians over
the removal of a Soviet war memorial.


One Russian citizen was killed in the first night of rioting on
Thursday.


More than 153 people, including 29 police, were injured and some
800 people were detained in the riots, which resumed Friday night
and saw gangs of youths rampage through Tallinn, smashing the
windows of the Art Academy, breaking into the National Theatre
and looting shops, police said.
