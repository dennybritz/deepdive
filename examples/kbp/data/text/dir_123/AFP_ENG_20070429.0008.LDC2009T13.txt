A South Korean tycoon is to be questioned Sunday by police after
an alleged gangster-style revenge attack for an assault on his
son, investigators said.


"Chairman Kim Seung-Youn plans to turn himself in for questioning
today (Sunday)," Hanwha Group spokesman Kang Ho-Kyun said,
confirming a statement by police chief investigator Jang Hee-Gon
on Kim's pending investigation.


Hanwha Group chairman Kim, 55, had rejected a police summons
twice on Saturday, the investigator said.


Police threatened to arrest Kim if he continued to reject the
summons, as the presidential Blue House called for a thorough
investigation Saturday.


Kim is accused of leading a group of his bodyguards to beat up
several people last month after his 22-year-old son was injured
in a brawl with them in a Seoul bar, according to local media and
police.


Kim's son, a Yale University student, reportedly received 10
stitches to a cut on his face after falling down stairs during
the fight.


Kim apologised in a statement Friday for "causing a stir" as the
case snowballed, making headlines and drawing criticism from
media and politicians.


It is rare here for a tycoon to be investigated for involvement
in violence. Hanwha is one of South Korea's top 10 conglomerates.


Some of those involved in the brawl with Kim's bodyguards said
that Kim himself participated in the violence at the Seoul bar,
while Hanwha officials denied the claims, according to police.


Kim's son, on an exchange student program at a Seoul university
now, has been in China since last week.
