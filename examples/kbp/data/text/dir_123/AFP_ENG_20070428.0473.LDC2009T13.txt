Children of US billionaire Donald Trump, the singer Julio
Iglesias and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta were among the
stars who gathered Saturday in the Dominican Republic's Cap Cana
to inaugurate a luxury marina, organizers said.


Touted as the "most complete and modern marina in the Caribbean,"
organizers said in a statement that the facility will, once
finished, be able to accommodate 1,000 yachts as well as mega-
yachts.


At the festivities on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic,
Eric and Ivanka Trump, whose father is one of the investors in
the complex, rubbed shoulders with 3,000 guests including
Iglesias, Dominican-born de la Renta and dancer Mikhail
Baryshnikov.


The inaugural bash was also to feature appearances by President
Leonel Fernandez, Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerra, the Santo
Domingo Philharmonic and performers from Canada's Cirque de
Soleil.


The complex is to stretch over 120 square kilometers (46 square
miles) and cost a total of two billion dollars.


It will include three golf courses designed by ex-champion Jack
Niklaus's company as well as four luxury hotels, a shopping
center and a Venice-like canal featuring seaview villas.
