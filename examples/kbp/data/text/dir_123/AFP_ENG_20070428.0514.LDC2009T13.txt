Prime Minister John Howard Sunday led the congratulations for
Australia's World Cup winning cricket team with praise for
outgoing fast-bowler Glenn McGrath.


Howard, often described as a "cricket tragic", said he got up in
the middle of the night to watch some of Adam Gilchrist's record
knock of 149 which put Australia on the road to victory against
Sri Lanka.


He then went back to bed before getting up to watch the last two
hours of the rain-delayed match played in Bridgetown, Barbados
which finished at about 8:30 am local time (2230 GMT Saturday).


Australia triumphed by 53 runs using the Duckworth/Lewis method
in a rain- shortened match concluded in gloomy light for an
unprecedented third straight World Cup win.


"My learned commentary is, my commentary is congratulations to
Ricky (Ponting) and the boys, but to Glenn McGrath, that lanky
bloke from Narromine, thanks for a wonderful contribution to
Australian cricket," Howard said.


"He's a wonderful bloke and he's been a wonderful player and he
went out on a very high note.


Australia scored 281 for four in 38 overs but Sri Lanka, in
reply, finished on 215 for eight after rain breaks reduced their
target to 269 off 36 overs.


McGrath, 37, finished his last match before retirement as the
tournament's leading wicket-taker with a record edition haul of
25 wickets and as the most successful World Cup bowler of all-
time.
