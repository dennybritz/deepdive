Actors and musicians including Elton John, George Clooney, Bob
Geldof and Mick Jagger called Saturday on world leaders to take
"decisive action" over atrocities in Darfur.


The statement was being released to coincide with the Global Day
for Darfur Sunday, marking the fourth anniversary of the
conflict.


"The international community must end its stalling and take
decisive action," the group, which also includes Hugh Grant, Mia
Farrow and Mark Knopfler.


"The perpetrators who carry out these atrocities must be
challenged and stopped."


The Global Day for Darfur was to be marked around the world by
activists overturning 10,000 hourglasses filled with fake blood.


The event has been organised by a coalition including Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch.


Protestors are to hold a march on Prime Minister Tony Blair's
Downing Street office plus a demonstration outside the Sudanese
embassy in London.


The conflict in the western region of Sudan has led to 200,000
deaths and two million people being displaced, according to the
United Nations.


Sudan contests the figures, saying that only 9,000 have died.
