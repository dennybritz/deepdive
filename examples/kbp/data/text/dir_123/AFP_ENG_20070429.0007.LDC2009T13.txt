An Indonesian man was executed by a firing squad for his 1999
conviction of killing a family of six on Borneo island, a jail
warden said Sunday.


Fourty-year-old Ayub Bulubili, was shot dead at 1:30 am Saturday
(1830 GMT Friday) at a shooting range in Central Kalimantan, said
Agustinus Siahaan, a warden at Palangkaraya jail where the
convict had been detained.


"He was executed early on Saturday morning and was buried near
here before noon," Siahaan said.


The convict, a catholic, was allowed to take part in a religious
service at the Palangkaraya jail before he was executed, he said.


Executions in Indonesia are usually by firing squad and are
carried out at night, in isolated locations. The prisoner is
notified of his execution date at least 72 hours beforehand.


Bulubili was found guilty of killing a family, including four
children, in Kapuas district in February 1999.


An appeal court and the Supreme Court upheld his death sentence.


Indonesia last carried out executions in September, when three
Christian militant leaders convicted of manslaughter during
sectarian violence in restive Central Sulawesi in 2000-2001 were
shot.


Their executions sparked international criticism and fuelled
further unrest between Christians and Muslims in the area.
