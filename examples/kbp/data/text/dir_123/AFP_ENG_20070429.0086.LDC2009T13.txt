Croatia's former prime minister Ivica Racan, who brought Croatia
closer to the European Union ending its international isolation,
has died after battling cancer, his party said Sunday. He was 63.


Racan, who served as prime minister between 2000 and late 2003,
died at 3:05 am (0105 GMT) on Sunday, the Social Democratic Party
(SDP) said in a statement.


"SDP and Croatia lost a man who marked our lives and the history
of this country in an inerasable way," the statement said.


Racan had been hospitalised in Zagreb since late March after
cancer spread to his brain. A month earlier he had undergone
surgery to remove a tumorous kidney.


He resigned as party leader earlier this month.


His government is credited with significantly improving Croatia's
post-war image and ending its international isolation after years
of autocratic rule by the late nationalist president Franjo
Tudjman, who died in 1999.


The Social Democrats have yet to elect Racan's successor ahead of
general polls later this year.
