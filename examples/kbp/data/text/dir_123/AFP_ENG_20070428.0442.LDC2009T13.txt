A Shell building in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo caught fire
early Sunday following a suspected aeriel attack by Tamil Tigers,
an official with the energy group said.


"There has been some explosion and we don't know the extent of
damage," said Shell Gas's media manager, Chamani Herath
Pathirage.


Fire engines were rushed to the scene after reports that three
buildings had been hit, but there were no reports of gas storage
tanks being affected.


Shell Gas Lanka, Sri Lanka's largest producer of gas, has a
storage facility just north of Colombo.


Shell, which acquired a 51 percent stake in the state-owned
Colombo Gas Company when it was privatised in 1995 for 37 million
dollars, is still partially owned by the government.
