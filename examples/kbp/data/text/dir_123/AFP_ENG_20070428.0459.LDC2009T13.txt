Adam Gilchrist admitted a third successive World Cup triumph was
an incredible achievement for the all-conquering Australians who
beat Sri Lanka by 53 runs in the final here on Saturday.


Gilchrist smashed a final record 149 off 104 balls to set up the
victory which was achieved in the gloom of Kensington Oval.


"It was really pleasing to do it on an important day. I've been
getting a lot of starts but hadn't converted," said Gilchrist
after a final marred by rain.


"It's terrific. The guys have worked so hard."


Gilchrist also hit eight sixes in his innings.


Australia coach John Buchanan, who now retires with another World
Cup triumph wrapped up, admitted his team were a class above
everybody else.


"It's like day and night between us and the rest," said Buchanan.


"It's a fairytale to win three World Cups in a row. It really is
an unbelievable achievement and it's due to the team and the
support team.


"We have great players and when you have great players this is
what happens."
