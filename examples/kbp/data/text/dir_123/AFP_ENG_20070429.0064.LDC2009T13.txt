A general election is to be held in Ireland on May 24, a
spokeswoman for Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said on Sunday.


In a surprise early morning move Ahern sought the dissolution of
the country's 29th Dail (lower house of parliament) by President
Mary McAleese at her official residence on the outskirts of
Dublin.
