A summit between Pakistan and Afghanistan aiming to cool
bilateral tensions in the fight against the Taliban insurgency
will go ahead as planned, officials here said Sunday.


Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf is expected to arrive in the
Turkish capital at 1100 GMT and Afghanistan President Hamid
Karzai at 1400 GMT.


Some reports had earlier suggested Musharraf could return home
after a suicide bomber killed 24 people and wounded Interior
Minister Aftab Sherpao at a political rally in northwest Pakistan
on Saturday.


Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer will host a dinner for the
two leaders before Monday's summit, the president's press office
said.


Mutual recriminations have clouded relations between Afghanistan
and Pakistan, both key US allies in the fight against terrorism.


Most Afghan officials, including Karzai, blame Pakistan for
failing to prevent Taliban-led militants from attacking their
country from bases in Pakistan's tribal areas along the border
with Afghanistan; some say Pakistan supports them.


Islamabad says it has taken effective measures and accuses Kabul
of shifting the blame for its own failures in tackling the
Taliban, a booming drug trade and the warlords undermining
government authority in the country.
