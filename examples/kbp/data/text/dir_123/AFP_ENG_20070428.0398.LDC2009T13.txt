Sri Lanka were 42-1 after 10 overs in the World Cup final against
Australia at Kensington Oval on Saturday chasing 282 to win off
38 overs.


Sanath Jayasuriya was on 21 with Kumar Sangakkara on 12.


Upul Tharanga was the first man out caught behind by Adam
Gilchrist off Nathan Bracken for six with the total on seven in
the third over.


Earlier, Gilchrist lived up to his billing as the most dangerous
one-day international batsman in the game with a record-breaking
149 as Australia piled up 281 for four.


Gilchrist's was the highest individual innings in a final,
surpassing the 140 not out made by Australia captain Ricky
Ponting against India in Johannesburg four years ago.


In all, Gilchrist faced just 104 balls with eight sixes and 13
fours as Australia set a daunting target in a match reduced to 38
overs a side because of rain.


Gilchrist, dropped on 31, and fellow left-hander Matthew Hayden's
stand of 172 was a new first-wicket record for a World Cup final,
surpassing the 129 shared by England's Mike Brearley and Geoff
Boycott during West Indies' 92-run win at Lord's in 1979.


It was the perfect platform for Australia as they set about
winning an unprecedented third straight World Cup and fourth in
all in a match reduced to 38 overs a side after rain delayed the
start.
