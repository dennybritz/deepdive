Tamil Tiger aircraft bombed oil and gas storage facilities in and
around the capital, but failed to cause substantial damage, the
defence ministry said in a statement.


The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) flew over the
Muthurajawela gas storage facility and dropped two bombs, but
they caused minor damages to a building and its water supply.


"The suspected LTTE aircraft have (dropped) four improvised
bombs," the ministry said in a statement.


The two bombs dropped on the oil facility failed to explode, the
statement added.
