Croatian Stipe Drews was crowned WBA light-heavyweight champion
here Saturday after a points decision over Italian veteran Silvio
Branco.


All three judges voted for Drews, 33, after the 12-round fight,
handing him his first world title and 32nd win in 33 contests.


It was a ninth defeat in 66 fights for Branco, 40, who inherited
the WBA crown in November after Frenchman Fabrice Tiozzo's
decision to retire.
