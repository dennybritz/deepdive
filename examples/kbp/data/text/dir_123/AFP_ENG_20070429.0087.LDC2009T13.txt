Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Sunday he wants to
avoid a military escalation in the Gaza Strip but warned the army
will react against rocket fire from the unruly territory.


"We do not wish to provoke an escalation, but we cannot ignore
the continuing firing of Qassam rockets into southern towns and
the attempts by terrorist commandoes to infiltrate" Israeli
territory, Olmert said at the opening of the weekly cabinet
meeting.


"We have sent a very clear signal on this matter to Palestinian
authorities and foreign leaders," he said.


"Under no circumstances will we abstain from taking necessary
measures to prevent these terrorists from putting in danger the
residents of the south of the country," Olmert said.


The armed wing of the Palestinian Hamas movement claimed to have
fired dozens of projectiles into Israel on its Independence Day
on Tuesday, declaring a five- month truce over after army raids
killed nine Palestinians the previous weekend.


Two days later Palestinian factions said they would continue to
abide by the truce, which took effect in the Gaza Strip on
November 26, provided Israel extends it to the occupied West
Bank.


Following Tuesday's rocket barrage, Olmert ruled out a widescale
operation inside Gaza but threatened to take "serious measures"
against Gaza militants.
