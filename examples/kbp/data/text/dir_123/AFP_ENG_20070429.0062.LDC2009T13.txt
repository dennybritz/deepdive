New Zealand Warriors left it until the final seconds to maintain
their eight- year dominance over South Sydney Rabbitohs to bring
off a last-gasp 18-16 National Rugby League victory here Sunday.


The Warriors, trailing 8-16 with three minutes left, scored two
tries to flatten the Rabbitohs, who looked to have worked their
way into a winning position.


Melbourne Storm lead the competition by two points from Manly
after seven rounds.


The Warriors leapfrogged Souths into joint third place on the
standings when winger Todd Byrne scored the winning try with 36
seconds left against the Rabbitohs.


Stand-off Michael Witt kicked for the corner and Byrne won the
sprint to cap off an improbable comeback in the dying minutes
after fullback Wade McKinnon had given the Warriors a lifeline
with a 45-metre try in the 77th minute.


Souths, rejuvenated this season under the coaching of Jason
Taylor, were looking to break an 11-match losing run against the
Warriors stretching back to 1999.


Newcomers Gold Coast Titans smashed the Parramatta Eels 38-12 in
Sunday's other match.


The Titans scored seven tries to two to thrill a sellout 18,000
crowd at Gold Coast Stadium.


Melbourne Storm remained unbeaten with a 28-18 win over champions
Brisbane Broncos in Brisbane on Friday to get the jump on Manly,
who went down 30-26 to the North Queensland Cowboys in
Townsville.
