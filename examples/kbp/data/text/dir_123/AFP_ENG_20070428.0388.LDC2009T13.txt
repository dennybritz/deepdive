The Red Cross has overseen the repatriation of more than 460
people people between war-torn African neighbours Ethiopia and
Eritrea, the international aid body said Saturday.


More than 430 people, including 40 unaccompanied children,
crossed from Eritrea to Ethiopia at their common border at the
River Mereb on Friday, the agency said in a statement.


ICRC said 33 people, including 10 unaccompanied children, crossed
the other way from Ethiopia into Eritrea.


The repatriation follows a similar large scale exchange of 400
people between the two countries in January.


They were displaced during the border war between the two
countries from 1998 to 2000.


The ICRC has been repatriating those displaced by the conflict
since the two Horn of Africa nations signed an agreement to end a
bloody conflict in December 2000.
