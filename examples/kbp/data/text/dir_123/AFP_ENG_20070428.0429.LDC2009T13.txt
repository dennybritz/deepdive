Lyon's Brazilian midfielder Juninho and international goalkeeper
Gregory Coupet are set to extend their contracts until 2010, club
president Jean-Michel Aulas said Saturday.


"I've accepted the principle of according the third year wanted
for Juninho but we have to now discuss the terms. It's a matter
of business," said Aulas.


"I've also accepted a third year for Gregory Coupet, who is a
very important leader within the squad. We must also talk terms
as well as things that should allow Lyon to still be at the top
for years to come.


"We're doing all we can to keep them by agreeing to their request
for a three- year contract, which for some fellows who already
have a bit of experience is a great vote of confidence because
they are players much admired by the public."


Lyon wrapped up the French championship a week ago, their record-
breaking sixth consecutive league title.
