Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has no intention of resigning
over the report on the failures of last year's Lebanon war,
expected to be critical of the premier, an aide told AFP on
Sunday.


"The prime minister has no intention of resigning, he will remain
at the head of the government," the aide said on condition of
anonymity a day before publication of the interim report by a
government commission.


Government spokeswoman Miri Eisin for her part told AFP that
Olmert, who according to published leaks will face harsh
criticism, "will not react to partial leaks in the media.


"We will wait patiently for the report to be published on Monday
afternoon before reacting," Eisin said.


According to leaks in the Israeli media, the interim findings by
a government commission led by retired judge Eliahu Winograd are
due to harshly criticise the way Olmert handled the 34-day war
against Lebanon's Hezbollah militia.


Defence Minister Amir Peretz and former army chief of staff Dan
Halutz, who resigned in January and became the most senior head
to roll over the war, are also expected to be roasted by the
findings, according to the leaks.


The report is expected to stop short, however, from calling for
the resignation of Olmert and Peretz.
