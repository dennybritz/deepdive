More than 100 Muslims protested on Sunday urging peace in
Thailand's restive south after an attack on a mosque killed a
retired teacher, local police said.


Suspected Islamic insurgents threw a grenade into a crowd of
people who were leaving the mosque after evening prayers late
Saturday in Pattani, one of three southern provinces beset by
separatist violence.


Moments later, the insurgents opened fire on the crowd outside
the mosque, police said, killing a former teacher and injuring
three people.


The attack sparked a protest at the mosque on Sunday, as up to
1,000 mourners gathered for the funeral of the 67-year-old
retired teacher.


Police said about 100 veiled women and their children staged a
short protest demanding peace in the south, where more than 2,100
people have been killed since the latest separatist insurgency
erupted in January 2004.


"Mostly women and children hiding their faces behind veils came
to protest and call for peace. They only protested for one hour
before leaving," said police colonel Thawal Nakrawong.


Violence against Muslims and Buddhists has surged recently in
Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat provinces despite efforts by the new
government to calm the tensions in the Muslim-majority region.
