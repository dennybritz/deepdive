England's Simon Dyson kept his nerve to move into contention for
a third European Tour title after the third round of the weather-
affected Spanish Open on Saturday.


Dyson, 29, birdied three of his first five holes to move to nine
under par for the tournament alongside Frenchman Gregory Bourdy
and Carlos Rodiles of Spain, who were both one under par for the
four holes they managed before play ended.


The first two rounds on Thursday and Friday were badly affected
by thunder and lightning, and thunderstorms forced a halt to play
on Saturday meaning a 1950 local time start for the leaders.


The delays mean that all 66 players who made the cut will return
Sunday morning to complete the third round before undertaking
their fourth and final round requirements.


The nearest challenger to the leading trio going into the final
day is Dyson's fellow Englishman Nick Dougherty, who is eight
under par for the tournament through four holes of his third
round.


However things are close going into the final day, with seven
players on seven under par while a further 10 are on six under
par at various stages of their third rounds.
