Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived on Sunday in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), the second leg of a tour aimed at
raising Japan's profile in a region vital for its supply of
energy.


Abe, who flew in from Saudi Arabia, was expected to meet senior
officials in the capital Abu Dhabi.


The emirate of Abu Dhabi sits on most of the country's oil and
gas reserves, ranked respectively as fifth and fourth in the
world. Proven oil reserves on their own are expected to last for
another 150 years.


In a visit to Saudi Arabia on Saturday, Abe met King Abdullah and
agreed to forge a "multi-layered partnership" beyond oil, while
urging Iran to take a constructive approach to resolve the crisis
over its nuclear ambitions.


Abe will also visit Egypt, Kuwait and Qatar on his five-day tour.
