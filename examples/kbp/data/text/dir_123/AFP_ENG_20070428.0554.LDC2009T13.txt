Robert Horry nailed a jump shot in the closing seconds and Tim
Duncan collected 20 points and 13 rebounds as San Antonio took a
two-games-to-one lead over Denver with a 96-91 win.


Tony Parker had 21 points and six assists for the Spurs, who used
a decisive third-quarter run to take control of Saturday's game.


The Spurs relied on their trademark defence in the final period
to secure the victory.


In his 15th season, Horry owns six championship rings as a member
of the Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers and Spurs.


But the lanky forward was more than just along for the ride on
those squads.


Horry built a reputation for hitting clutch shots in the biggest
moments and it was no different Saturday.


The 36-year-old forward, who already has hinted that this will be
his last season, made sure a Denver comeback was thwarted.


After two free throws by Marcus Camby cut the Nuggets' deficit to
five points, Horry came up huge on the ensuing possession.


Losing his dribble temporarily in the left corner, Horry righted
himself and drained an off-balance jumper with his foot on the
line to make it 94-87 with 43 seconds left.


Denver did not recover.


San Antonio went on a 14-5 run to end the third quarter, capped
by Horry's three-pointer with six seconds left to make it 75-67.
The spurt set the tone for the final period, which featured shut-
down defensive efforts from Duncan and Horry as the Nuggets tried
to drive to the basket.


But it has not been easy in the series for the Spurs, who won 13
more games than Denver during the regular season and entered the
series as a heavy favorite.
