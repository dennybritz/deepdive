A 25-year-old woodcarver arrested over the murder of a US Peace
Corps worker has said he hit her on the head with a rock when his
mind "went blank," according to news reports Sunday.


Juan Duntugan, who is in custody after being turned in by his
mother, told ABS- CBN television that he had an argument with
"someone" -- whom he did not name -- before bumping into Julia
Campbell.


"My mind went blank," he said during a reconstruction of the
crime. "I did not know who she was or what she was.


"I got a rock and I hit her on the head. If I can change my body
for hers I will do it. But that's not possible."


Duntugan will be charged with murder on Monday, ABS-CBN said on
its website Sunday.


The battered body of Campbell, 40, was found in a shallow grave
on April 18 near the hill country resort of Batad.


Campbell, who had worked as a volunteer teacher in impoverished
villages, disappeared after going trekking alone near Batad on
April 8.


She was last seen buying a soft drink at a store run by
Duntugan's wife.


Campbell's remains were cremated in Manila on Thursday.


She had worked in the Philippines for the past two years. She
previously lived in New York, where she worked as a freelance
journalist for publications including the New York Times.
