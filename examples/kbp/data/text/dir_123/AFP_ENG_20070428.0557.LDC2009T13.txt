Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his allies from other parts
of Latin America met here Saturday in a new bid to bolster their
"anti-imperialist" alliance.


Also taking part in the parley were Presidents Evo Morales of
Bolivia and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua as well as Cuban Vice
President Carlos Lage.


Haitian President Rene Preval and Ecuadoran Foreign Minister
Maria Fernanda Espinosa have been invited to take part as
observers.


In an opening speech, Ortega vowed to spare no effort to "put an
end to imperialist and capitalist domination" in the region.


Lage, for his part, emphasized the importance of political
integration over joint economic projects.


"We seek integration among our people rather than among our
markets," the Cuban official said.


Morales blasted US plans to unite all countries of the Western
Hemisphere in a free trade zone, calling instead for "fair trade
that allows countries to solve their economic problems."


The Bolivarian Alternative for the People of the Americas, as the
grouping is called, was launched in 2004 by Cuba and Venezuela.
Bolivia joined it last year and Nicaragua in January.


Members are focusing on development, education and health
projects. Venezuela has promised to address energy needs of the
members and sell them oil at a 50-percent discount.


"The Free Trade Area of the Americas is dead," Chavez told his
guests, referring to the US-backed project. "Meanwhile, the
Bolivarian Alternative has consolidated and will continue to
grow."
