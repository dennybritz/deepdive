China's central bank on Sunday ordered major commercial banks to
set aside more money in reserves in an effort to slow its economy
after higher-than-expected first-quarter growth figures.


The required reserve ratio will rise by 50 basis points to 11
percent with effect from May 15, the People's Bank of China said
in a brief statement on its website.


Speculation had been rife that the government would announce more
tightening measures after it unveiled 11.1 percent economic
growth in the first three months of the year.


The world's fourth-largest economy is fuelled by a potent mix of
exports and investments, and monetary measures such as this are
meant to reduce liquidity, which drives the massive spending on
new investment projects.


It is the fourth time the central bank has hiked the required
reserve ratio since the start of this year.


Last month, it also raised the benchmark one-year lending rate by
0.27 percentage points.


The central bank is fighting a rising tide of liquidity stemming
from export earnings as well as outstanding sterilisation paper
that is reaching maturity.


Sterilisation is a technical term for central bank operations
aimed at curbing liquidity rising as a result of an influx of
foreign funds in a tightly controlled exchange rate regime such
as China's.
