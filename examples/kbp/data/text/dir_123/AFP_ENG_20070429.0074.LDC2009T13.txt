The Iraqi capital awoke to a series of loud detonations on Sunday
as US artillery pounded targets in the violent southwest
districts of the city.


"Eighteen rounds of artillery were fired from Forward Operating
Base Falcon," said US spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Garver,
without identifying the target of a salvo that could be heard 10
kilometres (six miles away).


Occasional blasts could still be heard three hours after they
began, and Garver could not say whether or not the operation
would continue.


Falcon is a US base in the Rasheed district of south Baghdad,
surrounded by neighbourhoods that have seen some of the bloodiest
attacks on civilians and fiercest fighting between rival gangs in
Iraq's sectarian war.


Shockwaves rumbled over the city and blasts were audible in the
heart of the war-torn capital, which has seen no let up in
insurgent bomb attacks despite a 10-week-old security operation
by Iraqi and US forces.


Brigadier General Qassim Atta, spokesman for the Iraqi forces
involved in the security plan, told state television that the
blasts were the result of a joint operation, but did not say what
was causing them.
