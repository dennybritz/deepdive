Australia beat Sri Lanka by 53 runs here on Saturday to win the
World Cup for the third successive time and fourth overall.


But the match ended in farce.


With Sri Lanka struggling to reach the revised target of 269, the
batsmen went off for bad light and Australians started to
celebrate.


But the umpires insisted that the last three overs be bowled
despite the gloom at the Kensington Oval.


However, the game was eventually completed and the Australians
celebrated victory three overs later.
