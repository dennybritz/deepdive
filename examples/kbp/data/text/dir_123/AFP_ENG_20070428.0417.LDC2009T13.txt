Nine more US soldiers have been killed in fighting in Iraq, the
US military said Sunday, reporting casualties from incidents over
the previous two days.


The latest casualties brought US losses for the month to 91,
making April one of the bloodiest for the coalition in the four
years since its invasion, and total fatalities in the campiagn to
3,344.


"Three Task Force Marne soldiers were killed and one was wounded
when their patrol was struck by a roadside bomb southeast of
Baghdad today," the US command in Baghdad announced in a
statement.


Another Task Force Marne soldier was killed in a similar incident
on the same day. The US army unit patrols a violent belt of small
towns immediately south of Baghdad.


"Three soldiers and two marines assigned to Multinational Force
West were killed on April 27 while conducting combat operations
in Al Anbar Province," another statement said.


Anbar province in western Iraq is a hotbed of Sunni insurgents.
