The vast majority of listed companies in China saw their profits
more than double in the first three months of the year, state
media reported Sunday.


Of the 1,028 Chinese listed companies that have filed quarterly
fiscal statements so far, 941 have reported average profit
increases of more than 100 percent from a year earlier, the
Xinhua news agency said.


The performance of Chinese enterprises have ramifications for the
economy as a whole, as retained profits are a major source of
financing of corporate investments.


The combined profits of 941 companies listed on the Shanghai and
Shenzhen stock exchanges registered combined net profits of 67.9
billion yuan (8.8 billion dollars) in the first quarter of the
year, it said.


Business income of the 941 companies totaled 962.75 billion yuan
during the period, up 26.8 percent year-on-year, according to the
agency.


The average net profits of major steel makers grew by 216.6
percent year-on-year while companies in the petrochemical, power
and coal sectors also recorded big jumps, Xinhua said.
