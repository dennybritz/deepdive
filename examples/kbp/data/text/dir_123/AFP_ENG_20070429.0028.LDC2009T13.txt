Barry Bonds moved another step closer to Hank Aaron's major
league record by belting career home run No. 742 on Saturday.


Bond's heroics weren't enough though as Scott Hairston hit his
14th home run to power the Arizona Diamondbacks to a 5-4 victory
over Bonds and the San Francisco Giants on Saturday.


Bonds hit his eighth homer of the season and third off Arizona
pitcher Edgar Gonzalez to move to 14 shy of surpassing Aaron.


The Diamondbacks walked Bonds three times in the series opener on
Friday but they decided to change tactics in the first inning of
Saturday's contest by going right after Bonds.


Bonds hammered a 1-1 pitch from right-hander Gonzalez 428 feet
into right-centre field to give San Francisco a 2-0 lead.


The 42-year-old slugger remained on course to break Aaron's mark.


Bonds's heroics have been tainted by accusations of steroids
although he has said he never knowingly used steroids.


But Bonds's trainer, Greg Anderson, was among five men convicted
in the BALCO steroid scandal, and for much of Bonds's career,
Major League Baseball did not test for performance-enhancing
drugs.
