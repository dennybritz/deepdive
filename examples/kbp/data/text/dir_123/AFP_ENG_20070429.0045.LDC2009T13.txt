Iran's top national security official Ali Larijani is to visit
Baghdad for talks on next month's international conference on
Iraqi security, the foreign ministry spokesman said on Sunday.


"The visit of Mr Larijani is in the framework of bilateral
relations. He will probably talk about security questions and the
international conference" to be held in Egypt's resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh, Mohammad Ali Hosseini said.


Hosseini did not specify when the visit was taking place, but
state television cited a source in Iran's embassy in Baghdad as
saying Larijani would arrive on Sunday.


Iran has so far not announced whether it will attend the May 3-4
conference and Iraqi officials have been seeking to persuade
Tehran to take part.
