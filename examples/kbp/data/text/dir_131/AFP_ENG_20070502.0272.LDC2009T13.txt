US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in the Egyptian
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Wednesday for a landmark conference
aimed at stabilising conflict- torn Iraq.


She is expected to hold talks with Iraqi and other officials on
Wednesday to prepare for the two-day conference, which starts in
earnest on Thursday.


During a stopover in Ireland, Rice demanded a commitment from
Iraq's neighbours to work to stabilise the country.
