A former Iranian nuclear negotiator who served under the
presidency of Mohammad Khatami has been arrested, the state-run
IRNA  news agency and other media reported on Wednesday.


Hossein Moussavian was arrested on Monday "for security reasons"
at his house in Tehran, the agency cited unnamed informed sources
as saying.


The labour news agency Ilna quoted a judiciary source as saying
Moussavian had been arrested but did not give the reason.


The office of Moussavian, who now works for a research body,
declined to comment on the report.


Sources quoted by the Fars news agency said he had not been
arrested over any matter related to the nuclear issue but for his
"economic activities."


It also said he was likely to be released on bail later on
Wednesday.


Moussavian was a nuclear negotiator and also the negotiating
team's spokesman who served under Iran's then top national
security official Hassan Rowhani during the Khatami presidency up
to 2005.


During that period, Iran struck a deal with Europe that saw it
suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities, a halt
which was reversed under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
