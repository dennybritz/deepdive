A private helicopter carrying four people was reported missing
overnight, police said, adding that they were investigating
reports of a link with a Chelsea versus Liverpool match.


"We are investigating possible links to the Liverpool v Chelsea
football match but have not established anything so far," said a
police spokesman, after the helicopter went missing after taking
off from Liverpool late Tuesday.
