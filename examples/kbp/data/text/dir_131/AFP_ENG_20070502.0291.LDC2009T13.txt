A flurry of news on mergers and takeovers helped Wall Street keep
upward momentum Wednesday as media stocks led the upside in the
wake of a surprise bid by News Corp. for Dow Jones & Co.


In opening trades, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 30.88
points (0.24 percent) to 13,167.02, as the blue-chip index
extended its gains after closing at another record high Tuesday.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite increased 4.71 points (0.19
percent) to 2,536.24 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500
index rose 3.24 points (0.22 percent) to 1,489.54.


A driving factor "is renewed attention to media stocks," said
Joseph Hargett at Schaeffer's Investment Research after the hefty
five-billion-dollar bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for the
publisher of the Wall Street Journal.


The surprise bid has lifted other media stocks and fueled
speculation about more merger and takeover efforts in the sector.


Hargett added there were also "rumors circulating that NYSE
Euronext could make a bid for the International Securities
Exchange effectively crashing Deutsche Boerse's 2.8-billion-
dollar takeover of the American exchange."


Dick Green at Briefing.com said that after the merger frenzy news
passes, "we expect the momentum to fade."


"The indices were up about five percent in April, which is
historically the best month for the market. The economic numbers
will take on increasing importance, and there will be cause for
concern," Green added.
