Europe's biggest insurer Allianz saw a sharp rise in first-
quarter profits thanks to capital gains, it said on Wednesday.


Net profit rose 77 percent to 3.2 billion euros (4.3 billion
dollars), while group operating profit surged by more than 7.0
percent to 2.9 billion euros, despite claims of 340 million euros
from a winter storm that lashed Europe in January.


The results largely exceeded analysts' expectations.


Munich-based Allianz partly attributed the results to its sale of
stakes in carmaker BMW, reassurance giant Munich Re and retail
group KarstadtQuelle.


In early Frankfurt trading, Allianz shares were up almost one
percent to 168.35 euros on a market up 0.48 percent overall.
