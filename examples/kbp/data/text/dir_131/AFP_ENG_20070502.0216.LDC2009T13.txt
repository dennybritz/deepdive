A Palestinian man was killed on Wednesday by what medics said was
Israeli fire in the northern Gaza Strip, but the army denied the
incident.


Messaud Rajab Sabah, 35, was collecting scrap iron with his
brothers near the northern city of Beit Lahiya close to the
border with Israel when he came under fire from the army,
Palestinian medics said.


An Israeli army spokesman however said that a force performing
routine patrols along the Gaza-Israel border fence did not open
fire.


"There was routine activity along the security fence and the
force did not fire at anyone," a spokesman said.


Sabah's death brings to 5,675 the number of people killed since
the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000,
the vast majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP
count.
