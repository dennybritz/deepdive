The European Union is "watching very closely" WTO consultations
between Washington and Beijing over copyright piracy and is
demanding "results" from the Chinese, a European Commission
spokesman said Wednesday.


Commission spokesman Peter Power said the EU had joined the US
case against China at the World Trade Organisation as an
observer, as several other countries had done.


"We are watching very closely. This is of enormous importance for
the EU as for the US," Power said. "Consultations must yield
results now."


Last month, the United States formally lodged a complaint against
China at the World Trade Organisation over copyright piracy, with
fake DVDs and counterfeited luxury goods adding to existing
tensions between the trading giants.


Consultations with Beijing are under way with the aim of
resolving the dispute, but if they fail a WTO panel could then be
requested to referee the matter.


"It's up to the Chinese to reassure the parties that the issues
at stake are going to be dealt with in a way that will not
necessitate a full WTO panel," said Power.


With counterfeit DVDs and luxury goods widely available on the
streets of Chinese cities, China's position on intellectual
property rights is increasingly becoming a source of tension with
its main trading partners.
