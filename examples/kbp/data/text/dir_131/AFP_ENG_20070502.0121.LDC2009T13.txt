About 15 percent of government schools in Thailand's Muslim-
majority south have been torched while 71 teachers have been
killed in three years of bloody unrest, officials said Wednesday.


Separatist militants frequently attacks schools in the region
along the southern border with Malaysia because they are seen as
symbols of Thailand's attempt to impose Buddhist Thai culture on
this Muslim, ethnic Malay region.


A total of 71 teachers have been killed and 68 wounded in
shooting and bomb attacks, said Pradit Rasittanont, director of
the regional education office.


Some 166 of the region's 1,098 schools have been torched by
suspected Islamic insurgents, he added. Five of them had been
repaired and reopened only to be set ablaze again, Pradit said.


The attacks were more frequent during the just-ended six-week
school holidays, he added.


"There were 32 schools burnt during the holiday, which was
unprecedented," Pradit said.


"And there is a growing tendency for the militants to carry out
arson attacks during daytime," he said.


Armed soldiers escort teachers to and from school, and patrol the
campuses every day.


Education authorities have not compiled data on how many students
have been affected by the violence or how much the damage has
cost, Pradit said.


More than 2,100 people have been killed since the violence
erupted three years ago. Attacks have become more frequent in the
last six months despite a series of peace-building efforts by
Thailand's military-installed government.
