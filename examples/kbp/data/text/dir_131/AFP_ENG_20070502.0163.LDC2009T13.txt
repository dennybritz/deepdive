Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday
denounced a ruling by the Constitutional Court to annul the
first-round vote in the presidential election as "a bullet fired
at democracy."


"We respect the decision of the Constitutional Court, (but) it
will be much debated from the legal point of view," Erdogan told
members of his Justice and Development Party in parliament.


The ruling "blocked the way of electing a president in
parliament, almost made it impossible... This is at the same time
a bullet fired at democracy," he said.
