The unemployment rate in the 13 nations sharing the euro slipped
lower in March to a new record low of 7.2 percent, official
figures showed on Wednesday.


The rate, which the European Union's Eurostat data agency
adjusted to take seasonal variations into account, is the lowest
on Eurostat's books going back to 1993.


It marked a slight decrease from a rate of 7.3 percent reported
for February and a steady descent from the 8.2 percent registered
for March 2006.


Since peaking at 8.9 percent during an extended period ending in
September 2004, unemployment in the eurozone has steadily
declined as the economy gathers pace.


In the EU as a whole, unemployment was unchanged in March at 7.3
percent, after Eurostat revised the February rate down from a
previous estimate of 7.4 percent. It was down sharply from the
8.2 percent registered in March 2006.
