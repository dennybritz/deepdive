Nigeria has delayed an auction for 45 oil exploration blocs from
May 3 to May 11, Energy Minister Edmund Daukoru said Tuesday.


Nigeria, the world's sixth largest oil exporter, regularly puts
exploration fields up for auction to foreign and domestic
bidders. This latest round has been postponed several times since
late 2006.


Daukoru told oil operators and investors in Houston, in the US
state of Texas, that the deadline for registration has been put
back to May 5, Nigerian news agency NAN reported.


The minister assured his audience the electronic auction would be
"fair and transparent".


Last month, Daukoru announced that a mixture of Niger basin, deep
offshore and inland basin fields would be auctioned off.
Production sharing agreements would be signed two weeks after the
bidding round.


The new auction date of May 11 will take place before President
Olusegun Obasanjo hands over power on May 29 to his successor
Umar Yar'adua, who won contested elections last month.


Nigeria normally produces about 2.6 million barrels of crude per
day but hopes to raise this to four million by 2010. Current
production is being held back by unrest in the Niger delta.
