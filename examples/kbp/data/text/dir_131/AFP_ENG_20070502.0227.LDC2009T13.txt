A former Iranian nuclear negotiator who served under the
presidency of Mohammad Khatami has been arrested, the labour news
agency Ilna reported on Wednesday.


"Hossein Moussavian, a former member of the Iranian nuclear
negotiating team, has been arrested," the agency said, quoting a
judiciary source who declined to be named.


The office of Moussavian, who now works for a research body,
declined to comment on the report.


Moussavian was a nuclear negotiator and also the negotiating
team's spokesman who served under Iran's then top national
security official Hassan Rowhani during Khatami's presidency up
to 2005.


During that period, Iran struck a deal with Europe that saw it
suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities, a halt
which was reversed under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
