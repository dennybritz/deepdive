The European Commission urged Russia Wednesday to end a blockade
of Estonia's embassy in Moscow and said it wanted to send an EU
delegation to raise the issue with Russian authorities.


"We share the concerns about the increasing violence around the
Estonian embassy in Moscow," said an external relations
spokeswoman, calling on Russia to respect its international
obligations on embassies and their staff.


The spokeswoman said the Commission had launched a "troika
demarche" to send EU ambassadors to raise those concerns out of
"solidarity with Estonia".


"We have already requested for the appointment," she said.


On Wednesday, Estonia closed its consulate within the embassy
compound  after pro-Kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and
scuffled with the ambassador's bodyguards in protest at the
relocation of a Soviet war memorial in the Baltic state's capital
Tallinn.


Tallinn has called for help from the European Union and claims
that the Russian authorities are fomenting unrest in the former
Soviet republic.


"We hope that the whole issue behind this will be solved between
the Russian government and the Estonian government through
dialogue and negotiation," the Commission spokeswoman said.
