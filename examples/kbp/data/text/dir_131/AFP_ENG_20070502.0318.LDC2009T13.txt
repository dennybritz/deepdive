A US commission on Wednesday called for Vietnam to be reinstated
on Washington's blacklist of countries which violate the right to
religious freedom.


"We recommend that Vietnam be re-designated as a CPC (country of
particular concern) in 2007," the US Commission on International
Religious Freedom wrote in its annual report.


It said that since Hanoi was taken off the blacklist in November
2006 and it joined the World Trade Organization "positive
religious freedom trends have, for the most part stalled" amid a
crackdown on human rights activists.
