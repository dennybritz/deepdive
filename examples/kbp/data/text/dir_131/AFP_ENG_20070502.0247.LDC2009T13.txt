A modest 4.6-magnitude earthquake rocked a rural seaside area on
Japan's main island of Honshu Wednesday, but there was no fear of
a tsunami, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.


The epicentre of the quake, which occured at 8:44 pm (1144 GMT),
was located near Wajima, some 300 kilometres (190 miles)
northwest of Tokyo, which was hit by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake
on March 25.


The area has been rocked by numerous aftershocks of the massive
quake which killed one person and injured 218 others.


The focus of the latest tremor was about 10 kilometres (six
miles) deep, the agency said.
