Japan Airlines said Wednesday that it expects to post a net loss
of 16.2 billion yen (135 million dollars) for the year to March
2007 despite its earlier prediction of a return to profit.


Previously JAL, Asia's largest carrier, had forecast annual net
earnings of three billion yen.


JAL blamed the worse-than-expected performance on deferred tax
asset adjustments to its balance sheet and an extraordinary loss
resulting from a special early retirement program.


It is a second consecutive year of red ink for JAL, which made a
net loss of 47.2 billion yen in the previous financial year.
