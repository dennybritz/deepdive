A prisoner exchange between Israel and the Palestinians could
take place in "two or three weeks," Palestinian president Mahmud
Abbas said on Wednesday.


"There are negotiations mediated by Egypt between the Israeli
government and Hamas. From what I've learned recently, the
exchange could be concluded in two or three weeks," Abbas told
reporters in Ramallah after meeting with Israeli MP Yossi Beilin,
chief of the leftist Meretz party.


Israel and the Palestinians have engaged in drawn-out talks under
Egyptian mediation of a Palestinian prisoner release in exchange
for an Israeli soldier seized last June by Gaza-based militants,
including the armed wing of Hamas.


In April, Israel received a list of prisoners the Palestinians
wanted freed in exchange for the captured serviceman. The list
reportedly contained 450 names, including detainees involved in
attacks that killed Israelis and said by the Israeli government
to have "blood on their hands."


Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has so far ruled out releasing such
prisoners.
