Greece said Wednesday it wanted neighbouring Turkey to be
"stable, European and democratic", amid a crisis pitting the
Turkish government against the staunchly secularist army.


"We are following very closely and with great interest" political
developments in Turkey, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis
said, after talks with her visiting Tunisian counterpart here.


"Like all Europeans, we want a stable, European and democratic
Turkey," she added, declining to comment further on the internal
matters of a neighbouring state.


On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court annulled a first-round
presidential vote in which Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a
former Islamist, was the sole candidate.


Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-rooted Justice and
Development Party has now urged snap elections for June 24 to get
the country out of the crisis.
