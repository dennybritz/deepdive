Three years after joining the European Union, 86 percent of Poles
believe it has had a positive effect, compared to 69 percent who
supported entry in 2004, a poll published Wednesday revealed.


Seven percent of Poles are still against Poland's EU membership,
down from 22 percent in 2004, according to a CBOS poll of 937
people between March 30 March and April 2. Sixty four percent of
Poles believe that they have benefited from joining the EU, while
back in 2004 that figure was 40 percent.


Agriculture is the sector that has most benefited, according to
75 percent of those surveyed, an opinion shared by 73 percent of
farmers.


Other principal areas of Polish life that have been improved by
EU membership, are the environment (61 percent), productivity (57
percent) and  unemployment (56 percent).
