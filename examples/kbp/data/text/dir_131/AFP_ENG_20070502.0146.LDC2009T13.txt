A bomb tore through a minibus travelling south from Baghdad to
the town of Hilla through an area rife with insurgents on
Wednesday, killing at least eight passengers, local police said.


"We don't know exactly where the bomb exploded, either inside or
outside the minibus," said Captain Muthana Hassan of the
Mahmudiyah police.


Hassan said that "about ten" people were killed, while a security
source pegged the exact number of dead at eight, with four more
wounded.


At least three people were killed and 20 wounded in a mortar
attack on civilian areas of Mahmudiyah, the security offical
added.


The town is in area south of Baghdad that is often referred to as
the "triangle of death," and has remained volatile despite a new
security plan aimed at quelling the violence in Iraq.


Further south, a policeman was shot dead by unknown gunmen in the
city of Amara. Iraqi police and army soldiers have been frequent
targets in recent months as they have stepped up security patrols
across the country.
