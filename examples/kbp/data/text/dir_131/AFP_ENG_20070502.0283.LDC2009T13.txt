Former champion Shaun Murphy, trailing 11-5 overnight, produced a
stirring comeback to beat Matthew Stevens and book his place in
the last four at the snooker world championships here Wednesday.


Stevens of Wales looked to have the quarter-final wrapped up when
he took the first frame of the new session to go 12-5 and one
frame away from the semi- finals.


But Murphy knuckled down to reel off the next seven frames to
square an enthralling tie, the Englishman going on to clinch the
deciding frame 87-0.


He will now face the winner of the last eight tie between Ronnie
O'Sullivan and John Higgins who leads 11-5.
