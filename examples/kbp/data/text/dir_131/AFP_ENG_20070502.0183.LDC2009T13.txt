Southeast Asian economic ministers will meet in Brunei on
Thursday and Friday to discuss progress on efforts to establish
an economic community by 2015, the Singapore government said
Wednesday.


The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministers will
also meet with European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson
and Japan's Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Akira Amari, it
said.


In a statement, Singapore's trade ministry said the ministers are
expected to focus discussions on the progress of ASEAN efforts to
establish a unified market by 2015.


"In particular, ministers will discuss ASEAN's blueprint for
realising an ASEAN Economic Community by 2015, a document to be
endorsed at the ASEAN Summit in Singapore in November this year,"
it said.


Apart from meeting among themselves, the ASEAN ministers will
also meet as a group with Mandelson and Amari.


Japan and ASEAN officials who met in Tokyo last month had vowed
to try and work out the broad framework of a free trade deal,
which is expected to form the core of a more comprehensive
regional economic partnership agreement.


They said Japan and ASEAN hope to reach a broad accord on trade
during the Brunei meeting.
