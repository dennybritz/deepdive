Saudi Arabia on Wednesday executed four Pakistanis convicted of
murder and rape, the Saudi interior ministry announced.


Shah Mohammed, Mazhar Fathel Ilahi, Ijaz Ali and Mohammed Khan
were beheaded by sword in the western city of Medina in the
conservative Muslim kingdom, the ministry said in a statement
released by the official SPA news agency.


The group broke into the home of a Saudi national and assaulted
him, which led to his death. A member of the group then raped his
wife and stole money and jewellery.


The latest beheadings bring to 52 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in Saudi Arabia,
which applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law. Rape,
murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can all
carry the death penalty.
