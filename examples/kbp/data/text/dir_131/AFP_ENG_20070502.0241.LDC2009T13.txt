Germany's jobless rate fell to 9.5 percent of the workforce in
April from 9.8 percent in March, with the number of unemployed
dipping below four million to the lowest point in four and a half
years, official figures showed on Wednesday.


"The economic pickup continues to strongly stimulate the labour
market," said labour office chief Frank-Juergen Weise.


"Unemployment dropped below four million, the growth in
employment continues and the number of job vacancies went up
again," he said.


The number of jobless workers came to 3.967 million last month.


Labour Minister Franz Muentefering said Tuesday the April jobless
count had dropped below four million and predicted that the
number would continue to fall this year thanks to the booming
German economy, the largest in the eurozone.


After years of gloom, the German government last week raised its
growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent -- a clear improvement on
its previous prediction of 1.7 percent -- and consumer sentiment
and business confidence indices have also surged recently.


Analysts said they expected the jobless total to fall further in
the coming months.


Holger Schmieding, chief economist for Europe at Bank of America,
said the trend in the labour market "looks rock solid."


Chancellor Angela Merkel's left-right coalition government has
made cutting unemployment a priority since coming to power in
November 2005.


The German jobless total reached 5.216 million in February 2005,
the highest level since the end of World War II, largely as a
result of statistical changes connected with the government's
labour market reforms.
