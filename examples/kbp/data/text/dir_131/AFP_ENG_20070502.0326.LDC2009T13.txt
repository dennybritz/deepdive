Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni called on Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert to resign on Wednesday over a damning Lebanon war
report, upping the pressure on the beleaguered premier to step
down.


"I expressed my opinion that his resignation is the right thing
to do," Livni, a former close ally of the premier, told a press
conference after meeting Olmert.
