Iraqi security forces have banned trucks from all but two of
Baghdad's bridges in bid to prevent any more bomb attacks from
splitting the city, a security spokesman said on Wednesday.


"We have decided to ban the traffic of 1.5 tonne vehicles on all
bridges except for the al-Muthanna and Dura bridges," said
Brigadier General Qassim al-Musawi, spokesman for a 10-week-old
Baghdad security plan.


The measure will see heavy goods vehicles barred from 10 more
spans across the Tigris river, which divides the city into east
and west banks.


Any vehicle that parks on the bridges will be impounded for 10
days, added Musawi, quoting from an official statement from local
traffic authorities.


Bridges in the capital have come under attack twice in recent
weeks, including an April 12 truck bomb which destroyed one of
the city's oldest bridges and sent cars and twisted metal
plunging into the Tigris.
