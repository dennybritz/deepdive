Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived in Cairo on Wednesday,
on the final leg of a whirlwind Middle East and US tour, to hold
his first talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.


Abe flew in to the Egyptian capital from Doha, where he wound up
a trip to four Gulf states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates -- following his summit with US President
George W. Bush at Camp David.


Mubarak, who visited Japan in 1999, welcomes Abe for the first
time since the Japanese premier took office in September last
year.


Plans to widen dialogue among political, business and social
leaders of the two countries are expected to be high on the
agenda of the Japan-Egypt summit, a Japanese foreign ministry
official said.


Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the current
attempts to stabilise Iraq, as well as the standoff over Iran's
nuclear programme and the Arab-Israeli peace process were also
likely to be on the agenda.


Abe's visit came as world leaders were converging on the Egyptian
Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh ahead of a two-day conference
on Iraq due to kick off on Thursday.


Among other topics expected to be discussed is Tokyo's economic
support for Cairo, the official said. Egypt is the Middle East's
top recipient of Japanese financial assistance, which had
totalled 653.4 billion dollars by 2004.
