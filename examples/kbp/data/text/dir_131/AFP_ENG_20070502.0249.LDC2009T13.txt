Sweden on Wednesday issued a protest to Russia after its
ambassador there Johan Molander was attacked during a visit to
the Estonian embassy in Moscow, the foreign ministry said.


"The ambassador's car was stopped and attacked by a mob as he was
leaving the Estonian embassy," ministry spokeswoman Sofia
Karlberg told AFP.


"They kicked the car and tore off the Swedish flag. The
ambassador was not injured but the atmosphere was very
aggressive."


State secretary for foreign affairs Frank Belfrage on Wednesday
presented the Russian embassy in Sweden with a "strong verbal
protest."


The foreign ministry said in a statement that the Russian
ambassador had also been summoned to the ministry for a meeting
to be held later Wednesday.


"Russian police intervened too late and in an insufficient
manner," the ministry said, adding that the incident lasted 20
minutes.


Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told Swedish news agency
TT the incident was "serious and unacceptable", and reiterated
Sweden's support for the Estonian government.


Pro-Soviet youths have been camped outside the Estonian embassy
in Moscow for six days to protest against the relocation of a
Soviet war memorial in the Baltic state's capital Tallinn.


Molander visited the Estonian embassy to discuss the diplomatic
tension between Russia and Estonia.
