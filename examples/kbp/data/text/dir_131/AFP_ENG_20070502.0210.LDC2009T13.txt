Iran has arrested five people over the publication of caricatures
deemed insulting to Islam that sparked tensions at a prestigious
Tehran university, an official said on Wednesday.


"Five individuals who played a role in the publication of these
articles were arrested and an inquiry has been opened," said
justice ministry spokesman Ali Reza Jamshidi, according to the
ISNA agency.


Details of the incident remain sketchy but local reports said
that on Monday student members of the Basij vigilante militia
staged a protest at the university against the caricatures, which
appeared in four reformist student papers.


However members of the reformist student movement that run the
papers denied any involvement, saying the images were put into
papers bearing their insignia by unknown individuals as a "plot"
to discredit them.


Both sides on Tuesday then staged sit-in protests to denounce the
insults made against Islam in the papers, in an apparent show of
unity.


Jamshidi did not say whether the individuals arrested were
students and did not give their names. No details have been
released over the nature of the caricatures.


Amir Kabir university was involved in student demonstrations that
rocked Iran in 2002 and has often been seen as a hotbed of
student radicalism.


A speech by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the university last
year was interrupted by heckling and jeers as one student burned
his picture and another hurled a shoe.
