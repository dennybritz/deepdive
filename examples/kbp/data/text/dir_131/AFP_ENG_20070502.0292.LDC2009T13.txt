Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Wednesday he
is still considering whether to hold talks with US Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice at a conference on Iraq's security, the
Mehr news agency reported.


The agency said Mottaki, who is currently on a visit to Oman,
told its journalist that such a meeting is "under consideration
and no firm decision has been made."


Both Rice and Mottaki are due to attend the conference on
Thursday and Friday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-
Sheikh and there are mounting expectations of a rare bilateral
contact between the two sides.


Washington has repeatedly said it is ready for Rice to hold talks
with Mottaki at the conference, in what would be the highest-
level official contact between the two foes since the United
States cut relations in 1980.


However, Tehran has yet to give an unequivocal sign it is ready
for talks and Deputy Foreign Minister Mehdi Mostavafi said on
Tuesday the conditions were not right for a "dialogue" with Rice
at the conference.
