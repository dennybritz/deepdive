A bomb tore through a minibus travelling south from Baghdad to
the town of Hilla through an area rife with insurgents on
Wednesday, killing 11 passengers, local mayor Muayad Fadhil said.


Another three people were killed and 20 wounded when suspected
insurgents fired a salvo of mortar shells into a residential area
of his town, Mahmudiyah, 30 kilometres (19 miles) south of
Baghdad security officials said.


Another mortar attack was launched against a primary school in
the neighbouring town of Iskandiriyah, killing a young girl and
injuring her teacher, said Lieutenant Kadhim Kashash of the town
police.


In a separate attack, four people from the same family were
injured in a bomb blast targeting a house of a policeman in the
same area.


This region immediately south of Baghdad is often referred to as
the "triangle of death," and has remained volatile despite a new
security plan aimed at quelling the violence in Iraq.


Further south, a policeman was shot dead by unknown gunmen in the
city of Amara. Iraqi police and army soldiers have been frequent
targets in recent months as they have stepped up security patrols
across the country.
