Germany has proposed building a facility to enrich uranium under
the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent
countries from covertly developing nuclear weapons.


Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in the Handelsblatt
newspaper on Wednesday that a plant overseen by the UN nuclear
watchdog would ensure that "countries do not use uranium
enrichment secretly to build nuclear weapons."


"We must find ways in which each country can use nuclear energy
in a peaceful and unlimited manner without making access to the
bomb possible," Steinmeier wrote.


Such a facility would also "ensure the security of energy
supplies," Steinmeier added.


Germany, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the
European Union until the end of June, proposes that the
enrichment plant be built on neutral territory.


Along with France and Britain, Germany engaged in negotiations
with Iran over its contested nuclear programme.


Many Western countries suspect Iran is trying to build a nuclear
weapon, but the Islamic republic insists it is merely developing
a nuclear energy capability.
