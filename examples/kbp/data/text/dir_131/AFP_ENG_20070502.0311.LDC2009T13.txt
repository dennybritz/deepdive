The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and the Chairman of the
Irish Council of Imams issued an unprecedented joint appeal on
Wednesday for the release of kidnapped BBC journalist Alan
Johnston.


Johnston, 44, disappeared on March 12 in Gaza City and is feared
kidnapped, though there has been no confirmed word on his
whereabouts.


In the first co-operation of its kind between the two faiths in
Ireland, the Catholic and Muslim leaders pleaded in the "pursuit
of peace and freedom, values treasured by each of our religions"
for Johnston's captors to let him go immediately.


Doctor Diarmuid Martin and Sheikh Hussein Halawa, imam of the
Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland, said they represented the
majority faith in Ireland and the majority faith in Gaza.


"We stand here united in seeking the safe return of Alan Johnston
to his family, friends and colleagues," they said in a statement.


"We come together in solidarity with all those who have called
for his release. We note that these include the leaders of the
Palestinian people as well as many, many citizens of Gaza," they
added.


"Abducting a reporter can never help a cause, especially when the
reporter is as fair and honest as Alan. It can only harm the real
interests of the Palestinian people."
