A 27-year-old German tourist drowned Wednesday after attending
the famed full moon party on one of Thailand's most popular
holiday islands, police said Wednesday.


Maurice Pascal Kreuzer from Heidenburg was found dead early
Wednesday on Rin beach at Phangan island, 645 kilometres (400
miles) south of here, police said.


"He died around dawn after he went swimming while drunk,"
lieutenant colonel Kosol Keankaew of the local marine police
said.


The full moon party attracts thousands of revellers every month
for a night of drinking and dancing on Phangan island's lush
tropical beaches in the Gulf of Thailand.
