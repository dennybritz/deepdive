Everton's Andy Johnson is set to miss England's Euro 2008
qualifer against Estonia next month after his club confirmed he
must undergo surgery at the end of the season.


The 26-year-old striker suffered an injury to his right ankle but
it is his left ankle that requires an operation.


He is destined to miss out on England's friendly with Brazil on
June 1 and the trip to Estonia five days later.


Everton head physiotherapist Mick Rathbone told the club's
official website, on Wednesday: "After injuring his right ankle,
we were hopeful that the subsequent period of rest would help his
left ankle.


"However, that has not been the case and the player will have an
operation as soon after the final match of the season as
possible.


"Andy has had the problem for a number of months now and it is
getting no better."


The news comes as a blow to England boss Steve McClaren who will
now be hoping Michael Owen will have made a full recovery from
the injury he suffered in last year's World Cup.
