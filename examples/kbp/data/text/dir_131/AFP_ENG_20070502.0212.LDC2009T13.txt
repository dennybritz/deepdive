A key Janjaweed leader, Ali Kosheib, is being singled out for war
crimes committed in villages of Sudan's war-torn Darfur region
between 2003 and 2004, bringing the militia into sharp focus.


The International Criminal Court has issued its first arrest
warrants over the Darfur conflict for the Janjaweed leader and
Ahmed Haroun, Sudan's secretary of state for humanitarian
affairs, documents showed on Wednesday.


Mounted on camels and horses and wielding assault rifles, the
Janjaweed's name literally means "devils on horseback" in Arabic
and their brutal suppression of the revolt in Darfur since 2003
is central to the crisis there.


Once just raiding nomads, the Kalashnikov-wielding Janjaweed were
transformed into a more ominous force when they were recruited
and armed by the Sudanese government to crush the Darfur
rebellion in western Sudan.


The nomads are believed to have immigrated to the Darfur region
from neighbouring Chad back in the 1980s.


According to human rights organisations, the Janjaweed were
practically given free rein by the government to rape, pillage
and destroy the villages of the African tribes supporting the
rebellion.


Khartoum has never admitted to having links with the Arab
militia.


"If by Janjaweed, you mean outlaws ... that committed crimes,
well we are against them and police are pursuing them, arresting
them and taking them to justice," Sudan's President Omar al-
Beshir said in 2004.
