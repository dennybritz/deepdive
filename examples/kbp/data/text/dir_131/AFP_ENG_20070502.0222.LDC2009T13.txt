Dubai's Emirates Airlines said on Wednesday it would resume day-
time services to Sri Lanka which were suspended following Tamil
rebel air raids near the island's only international airport.


"Following a review of the situation in the Sri Lankan capital,
Colombo, Emirates will recommence services on Friday," a
spokesman said.


The airline stopped its services shortly after Sunday's latest
rebel air attack.


Emirates said it would only fly to Bandaranaike International
Airport -- which shares a runway with the Sri Lankan air force --
during daylight hours.


Emirates, which owns a 43.6 percent stake in the national carrier
SriLankan Airlines, operates flights from Dubai to the Maldives,
Singapore and Indonesia through Colombo.


The Dubai airline and Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific
earlier suspended their flights to Sri Lanka after Tiger
guerrillas flew light aircraft across the air space of the
international airport and bombed oil depots.


In Sunday's attack, a fuel storage tank was destroyed and two
buildings suffered fire damage.


Cathay, Asia's third-largest carrier, has yet to resume
operations while Singapore Airlines announced it would resume
daytime flights to Colombo.


Singapore Airlines, Cathay and Emirates account for about a
quarter of Sri Lanka's air passenger traffic, according local
travel agents.


Emirates' suspension of services left Sri Lanka's World Cup
cricket team stranded in London without a connecting flight home.


The players will now arrive on another airline, a Sri Lanka
Cricket spokesman said.


Sri Lanka lost to Australia in Saturday's final in Barbados.
