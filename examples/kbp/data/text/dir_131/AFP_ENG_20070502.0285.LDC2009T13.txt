A senior Ugandan army officer widely seen as a possible successor
to President Yoweri Museveni has died in Kenya, an official
statement said Wednesday.


Brigadier Noble Mayombo, 42, who last served as the defence
ministry's permanent secretary, died in Nairobi's Aga Khan
hospital on Tuesday where he was receiving treatment for multiple
organ failure.


"It is chilling that we have lost a person of such calibre, more
so at such a young age," said Ofwono Opondo, spokesman for the
ruling National Resistance Movement party.


"Some people were already beginning to think that he had the
qualities of Mzee (Museveni) and were seeing him as a probable
replacement," Ofwono said in an obituary published in the state-
run New Vision newspaper.


Defence Minister Crispus Kiyonga said the government had launched
an investigation into Mayombo's death in response to widespread
speculation that there had been foul play involved.


Mayombo, a former close aide to Museveni, was previously chief of
military intelligence and also a member of parliament
representing the army.
