The president of the European Parliament called on EU member
states to push for a European constitution ahead of the 2009
European elections, in a speech to the Polish parliament
Wednesday.


"We need to find a consensus on the content of the constitutional
treaty and we need to ensure that it can be ratified in time for
the European Parliament elections in 2009," said Hans-Gert
Poettering.


"We have a unique chance to advance the cause of freedom, unity
and solidarity in the European Union. Today we have a profound
obligation to tackle the challenge of our own time."


Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, is trying
to get approval from the 27 member states to renegotiate an
existing draft treaty during an intergovernmental conference
later this year.


While 18 countries have ratified the draft the other nine,
including Poland, suspended the process after referenda in French
and Dutch rejected the document in 2005.


Poettering visit to meet Polish deputies marked the anniversary
of Europe's first democratic constitution, adopted by Poland and
Lithuania on May 3, 1791.


"In Europe we live in peace and freedom thanks to Polish and
Lithuanian freedom," said Poettering.


The anniversary was also marked by Lithuania's parliament, and a
television link-up allowed lawmakers there and in Warsaw to
follow each other's debates.
