The ex-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan plans to double the number
of its soldiers serving with US-led coalition forces in
Afghanistan from 22 to between 40 and 44, the foreign ministry
said Wednesday.


"We understand there is a need in Afghanistan and as a
responsible member of the international community, Azerbaijan is
willing to commit more troops," Foreign Ministry spokesman Khazar
Ibrahim told AFP.


He said the troops would arrive in Afghanistan "soon" but that a
final date for their deployment had not been set.


Azerbaijan has contributed forces to Afghanistan, Iraq and Kosovo
as President Ilham Aliyev seeks closer ties with the United
States and NATO.


More than 50,000 NATO and US-led troops are in Afghanistan
fighting Taliban insurgents alongside the Afghan army and police.
