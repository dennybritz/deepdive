The remains of 12 soldiers, including one probable Red Army
officer, have been unearthed at the site of a Soviet war
memorial, whose removal by Estonia has sparked a heated row with
Russia.


"We uncovered 12 coffins in total, all of which had skeletons
inside," Ullar Lanno, director of the Estonian Forensic Medical
Bureau told AFP on Wednesday.


The human remains have been taken to a laboratory to be cleaned
up and undergo DNA testing, he said.


Six coffins had been uncovered and opened Monday, but the experts
working at the site had not then been able to access the
remaining six, buried in a separate nine-metre (30 feet) long
row.


Excavation work had begun Saturday at the site in central Tallinn
from where the monument to Red Army soldiers who died in World
War II was moved last week, sparking riots here and fury in
Moscow.


One Russian man was killed and more than 150 people injured,
including 29 police, in two nights of rioting in Tallinn last
Thursday and Friday.


Anti-Estonian protests have been held in Ukraine and around
Russia.


In Moscow, the Estonian embassy has been under siege for six
days, and the Estonian defence ministry said the ambassador to
Russia was physically attacked while attending a press
conference.
