Former world 800m champion Ludmila Formanova of the Czech
Republic announced her retirement here on Wednesday.


"I took this decision for two main reasons: the state of my
health and secondly, my son, Petr. I want to devote more time to
him," the 33-year-old said.


Formanova was crowned world champion of the two-lap event in
Seville, Spain in 1999 and also won the world indoor
championships in Maebashi, Japan in the same year.


A foot injury saw her pull out of her heat in the 2000 Olympic
Games in Sydney, and she has not competed at top international
level since 2002.


Formanova took a year out from competitive sport in 2005 to have
a baby but returned a year later only to be plagued by a muscle
injury from February that year.
