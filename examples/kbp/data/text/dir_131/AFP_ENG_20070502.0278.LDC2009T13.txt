Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) Wednesday
passed through parliament a new timetable for voting in a
turbulent presidential election, setting the first round for
Sunday.


The second round is scheduled for May 9, the third for May 12 and
the fourth and final round for May 15.


The Constitutional Court Tuesday, petitioned by the opposition,
annulled Friday's first round of presidential voting on the
grounds that the 550-seat parliament met without the required
quorum of 367.


The AKP insists that the first round be repeated, even though the
sole candidate, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, is unlikely to win
the required two- thirds support, with parliament concentrating
on early general elections.


The AKP earlier Wednesday called for early elections on June 24
as a way out of Turkey's current political crisis after the
Constitutional Court cancelled the first-round presidential vote.
