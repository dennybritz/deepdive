French magistrates investigating the 1995 death of a French judge
in Djibouti Wednesday asked the Paris military governor to allow
a search of the Elysee presidential palace, a source close to the
case said.


Gendarmes barred judges Fabienne Pous and Michele Ganascia
earlier from carrying out the search at the African affairs
offices of the presidency, said the source who asked not to be
named.


The half-charred body of French judge Bernard Borrel was found in
a ravine on October 19, 1995, some 80 kilometres (50 miles)
outside of Djibouti.


Djibouti authorities concluded that Borrel, who served as an
adviser to the justice ministry, had committed suicide but French
coroners have disputed this version and suspect he may have been
murdered.


Borrel's widow Elisabeth accuses Paris of wanting to bury the
case.


Two other searches were carried out last month at the offices of
the foreign and justice ministries.


French judges have unsuccefully sought to question Djibouti
President Ismail Omar Guelleh and other senior Djibouti officials
in the investigation.


The Borrel affair has been a source of tension between Djibouti
and France, which has a strategically important military base
there.
