The former chairman of ailing Egyptian football giants Zamalek
was sentenced to three years in prison Wednesday for defaming
court officials, judicial sources said.


Mortada Mansour was sentenced to three years in jail by a
criminal court in Cairo for "insulting" court officials and
levelling accusations of corruption against them.


Mansour was suspended from his club's presidency last year for
inappropriate behaviour during a derby against Cairo arch-rivals
Ahly.


He challenged the decision in court and was initially reinstated
before the supreme administrative court eventually upheld his
suspension.


Mansour, himself a former judge, was detained by police after
storming the offices of the court's top judge in March.


Zamalek currently sits third in the Egyptian league, 11 points
behind leaders and African champions Ahly.
