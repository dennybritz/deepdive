South African football international Jabu Mahlangu was arrested
and charged with raping a 19-year-old woman on Wednesday, police
said.


The 26-year-old Bafana Bafana star, who currently plays for the
Johannesburg- based Orlando Pirates, handed himself in at a local
police station, accompanied by his lawyers.


"He was charged with rape and will appear in court tomorrow
(Thursday)," police spokeswoman Captain Cheryl Engelbrecht told
AFP.


The Sowetan newspaper earlier reported that Mahlangu had agreed
to surrender to police after they had come looking for him during
a training session on Tuesday with the Pirates.


The midfielder, who has also previously played for Kaizer Chiefs,
joined the Pirates after being sacked by the Austrian club SV
Mattersburg after a night out drinking with friends.


Mahlangu represented the national team at the 2002 World Cup and
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney but he has been left out of
more recent squads.
