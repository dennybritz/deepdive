Several thousand Kosovo Albanians on Wednesday marched in support
of their former prime minister Ramush Haradinaj, as his war
crimes trial was being held in The Hague.


The peaceful demonstration was staged in the main street of the
capital of Pristina.


It was the last in a series of 15 marches held by his supporters
in Kosovo since his trial opened in March at the UN's
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.


"With Ramush", the protestors chanted, demanding his release,
waving Albanian and US flags alongside photographs of the former
guerrilla commander.


Haradinaj, 38, is accused of persecution, cruel treatment and
murder committed against Serbs, Roma and ethnic Albanian
civilians during Kosovo's 1998-1999 conflict.


He is considered a hero by many of the 90-percent ethnic Albanian
population in the UN-run province.


Ahmet Isufi, deputy president of Haradinaj's Alliance for the
future of Kosovo (AAK)  party, said the march was to show
Haradinaj' place "is not in The Hague but here."


Haradinaj was a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a
group of separatist rebels that fought forces loyal to late
Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic during the conflict.


The southern Serbian province of Kosovo has been a UN
protectorate since the conflict in mid-1999, in which NATO
bombing helped to end a bloody Serbian crackdown on Kosovo's
majority ethnic Albanians.


Haradinaj, who became leader of the AAK party after the conflict,
was indicted in 2005 while serving as prime minister.


After resigning, Haradinaj gave himself up to the ICTY.
