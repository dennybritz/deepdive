Former champion Shaun Murphy, trailing 11-5 overnight, produced a
stirring comeback to beat Matthew Stevens and book his place in
the last four at the snooker world championships here Wednesday.


Stevens of Wales looked to have the quarter-final wrapped up when
he took the first frame of the new session to go 12-5 and one
frame away from the semi- finals.


But Murphy, who beat Stevens to win the 2005 title, knuckled down
to reel off the next seven frames to square an enthralling tie,
the Englishman going on to clinch the deciding frame 87-0.


He will now face the winner of the last eight tie between Ronnie
O'Sullivan and John Higgins who leads 11-5.


Murphy said he was as shocked as anyone else by his remarkable
comeback win.


He told BBC Sport: "I went to bed last night and never believed I
could do it.


"Everyone says 'you can do it' but you never believe you can.


"I just hacked away at his lead and before I knew it, I was
shaking his hand at the end."


One person missing from the Crucible audience to witness the
drama was Murphy's father, Tony who hasn't spoken to his son for
over a year after a falling out.


"It's a great shame," Murphy junior said.


"Eveyone has trouble with their family, and I'm no different.


"The door's always open, I've been waiting for him to pick up the
phone - my number hasn't changed.


"He's not here but if he picks the phone up and sorts it out,
he'd be welcome."
