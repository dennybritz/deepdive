A Palestinian man was killed on Wednesday by Israeli army fire in
northern Gaza Strip, medics said.


Messaud Rajab Sabah, 35, was collecting scrap iron with his
brothers near the northern city of Beit Lahiya close to the
border with Israel when he came under fire from the army, they
said.


The Israeli army had no immediate comment.


His death brings to 5,675 the number of people killed since the
start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the
vast majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP count.
