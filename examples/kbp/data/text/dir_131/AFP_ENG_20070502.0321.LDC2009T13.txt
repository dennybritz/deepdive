The International Ski Federation (FIS) has received applications
from 12 candidates to host world championships in 2012 and 2013.


Cortina d'Ampezzo (Italy), Schladming (Austria), St Moritz
(Switzerland) and Vail (USA) all submitted applications to
organise the 2013 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships.


FIS said there were five applications for 2013 FIS Nordic World
Ski Championships submitted by Falun (Sweden), Lahti (Finland),
Oberstdorf (Germany), Val di Fiemme (Italy) and Zakopane
(Poland).


The Norwegian town of Vikersund will compete against Harrachov in
the Czech Republic for hosting rights for the 2012 FIS Ski Flying
World Championships.


There was only one application for 2013 FIS Freestyle World Ski
Championships, submitted by the Norweigan resort town of Voss.


No application had been received for the 2013 FIS Snowboard World
Championships by the May 1 deadline.


But interest has been expressed by a candidate and the deadline
has been extended until May 28, when the FIS Council meets next,
the federation said.


The FIS Council will elect the organisers of the 2012/2013 FIS
World Championships during the Congress Week in Cape Town, South
Africa, in May 2008.
