A Taiwanese opposition lawmaker and Olympic medalist Wednesday
launched a petition urging the government to allow the 2008
Olympic torch relay to visit the island on its way to Beijing.


"The Olympic torch relay will let the world see that Taiwan does
exist and help highlight its sovereignty. The people welcome the
torch," said lawmaker Huang Chih-hsiung of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).


Beijing Games organisers announced last week that the flame would
visit Taiwan after sweeping through the cities of Pyongyang and
Ho Chi Minh, before moving on to Hong Kong and Macau.


Taiwan immediately rejected the plan, saying the route was aimed
at belittling the island, which Beijing considers part of its
territory awaiting reunification.


Taiwan authorities demanded that the torch must arrive and leave
the island via a third country, excluding the Chinese territories
of Hong Kong or Macau, to highlight the island's sovereignty.


"If the government refuses the relay for political reasons, it
risks marginalising Taiwan and projecting an image as a
troublemaker. It would also affect Taiwan's chances of organising
international sporting events in the future," Huang warned.


Huang, a silver medalist in taekwondo at the 2004 Athens
Olympics, said he expected to collect at least 100,000 signatures
to petition the cabinet and the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports.


Taipei last hosted a leg of the torch relay for the 1964 Tokyo
Olympic Games.


China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since they split in
1949 at the end of a civil war.
