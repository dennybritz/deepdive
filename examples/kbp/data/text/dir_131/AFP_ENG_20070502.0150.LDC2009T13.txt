At least 22 people were killed and 24 injured in India's northern
mountain state of Himachal Pradesh Wednesday when a bus plunged
into a gorge, police said.


It was on its way from the town of Kiari when it plummeted 300
metres (980 feet) near Kotkhai, 64 kilometres (40 miles) from
state capital Shimla, regional police chief Anand Pratap Singh
told AFP.


"Eighteen people were killed on the spot, and four were declared
dead on arrival at the hospital," Singh said.


Himachal Pradesh authorities suspect the accident was caused by
mechanical failure as survivors reported hearing a "loud noise"
before the bus fell down the slope.


Three women were among the dead, Singh said.


Road accidents with high death tolls are common in India due to
bad roads, overloaded public transport and reckless driving.


Last week, 30 people were killed when their bus plunged into a
mountain river in India's Kashmir region.
