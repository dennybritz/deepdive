Suspected pro-Taliban militants in a remote Pakistan border town
beheaded an Afghan refugee on charges of spying for US troops in
Afghanistan, a security official said Wednesday.


Militants slaughtered Shamsuddin Afghani and dumped his body near
a military checkpost at Goorwak village in the tribal North
Waziristan district, the security official said.


A note left near the body said "this is the fate of American
spy," the official said, requesting anonymity.


Troops at a nearby post found the body along with the severed
head and handed it over to the villagers, who identified the man
as an Afghan refugee, he added.


Pro-Taliban militants have gunned down or beheaded several local
people and Afghan nationals residing in the area for allegedly
spying for US-led forces in Afghanistan.


The victims include tribesmen supporting Pakistan's campaign
against Al-Qaeda and Taliban fugitives in the rugged area.


Pakistan, a key US ally in the "war against terrorism", has
deployed some 80,000 troops to hunt down Taliban and Al-Qaeda
fighters believed to have sneaked into the tribal terrain after
the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in late 2001.
