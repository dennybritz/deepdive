Hong Kong share prices closed 0.34 percent higher Wednesday led
by index heavyweight HSBC following news that a unit of Dubai
International Capital (DIC) has made a substantial investment in
the global banking giant, dealers said.


Strong performances on Wall Street and in Tokyo also prompted
some bargain- hunting following losses before the Labour Day
holiday, although trading overall was lacklustre, they said.


The key Hang Seng index closed up 69.51 points at 20,388.49.


The market was closed Tuesday for a public holiday.
