Seven Chinese oil workers abducted during a deadly attack on an
oil facility in Ethiopia returned home Wednesday after their
release, state media said.


The workers were taken hostage last week when the rebel Ogaden
National Liberation Front (ONLF) raided the Chinese-run site in
an attack that left 77 people dead -- 68 Ethiopians and nine
Chinese.


The seven arrived back in China on a flight from the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa, Xinhua news agency reported.


The ONLF, which wants independence for ethnic Somalis living in
Ethiopia's Ogaden region, had released the hostages to the
International Committee of the Red Cross after a temporary
ceasefire was arranged with the Ethiopian army.


The group has urged China to stop cooperating with Ethiopia on
oil exploration until the group gains self-government in Ogaden,
but it said that the attack was not targeting China.
