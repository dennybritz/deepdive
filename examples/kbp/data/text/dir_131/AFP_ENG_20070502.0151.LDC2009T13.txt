A Scottish woman has admitted putting dog excrement in her
husband's curry after their relationship broke down, the state
prosecutor's office said Wednesday.


Jill Martin, 47, started laughing after placing the dish in front
of husband Donald and watching him eat it, prosecutor Margaret
Dunnipace told Paisley Sheriff Court in west central Scotland in
comments quoted by the BBC online.


Her lawyer, Terry Gallanagh, reportedly said the case was like
"an episode of 'Desperate Housewives,'" the award-winning United
States comedy which follows the lives of five women in suburbia.


The March incident came amid trouble in the couple's 21-year
marriage -- Gallanagh said Martin suffered mental abuse over five
years and that her husband had questioned her parenting skills
and started a business without her knowledge.


She also thought he had started an affair, although this belief
turned out to be groundless.


After Martin's arrest, she was banned from going near her husband
or their home in the plush suburb of Newton Mearns, Glasgow.


At first, she said she laced the curry with arsenic, but later
said it was actually dog excrement.


Martin pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct plus
breaching the peace Tuesday and will be sentenced on November 1.


The couple have now started divorce proceedings.
