Continental, the German maker of tyres and car parts, said
Wednesday it recorded a year-on-year rise of 21.9 percent in net
profit in the first quarter.


Net profit in the period was 270.5 million euros (368 million
dollars), outpacing analysts' expectations, which was reflected
in a 3.11 percent rise in its share price to 105.67 euros soon
after the markets opened.


Operating profit came to 436.8 million euros, up 24 percent
compared with the same period last year, while turnover was 3.96
billion euros, showing a year-on- year rise of 9.8 percent.


Continental boss Manfred Wennemer said the results were boosted
by buoyant car production in Europe and Asia.
