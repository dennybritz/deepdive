Two policemen have been killed and a third serviceman has been
found dead in Chechnya in the latest unrest in the rebel region,
law enforcement officials in Grozny said Wednesday.


The two policemen were killed Tuesday after their car hit an
explosive device in Grozny, Nikolai Kalugin, deputy prosecutor
for Chechnya, told AFP.


The body of a Russian soldier bearing signs of beating was
discovered in a car under a bridge near the southeastern town of
Shali, Interfax news agency quoted police as saying. However,
local officials told AFP that the soldier had probably died in a
car accident.


On Tuesday another two Russian soldiers were wounded in a blast
in Ingushetia, which neighbours Chechnya and has close links to
the mostly Muslim mountain province.


Russian forces have fought two wars in the last 12 years to crush
separatist rebellions in Chechnya. Moscow has repeatedly declared
defeat of the rebels, but clashes continue.


Last week rebels shot down a helicopter during a battle in the
mountains, killing 18 servicemen.


An estimated 100,000 of Chechnya's one million people have been
killed in the confict and, according to official figures, some
10,000 Russian servicemen.
