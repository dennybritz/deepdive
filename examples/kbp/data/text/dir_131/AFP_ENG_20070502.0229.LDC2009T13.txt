The European Commission on Wednesday issued a final warning
before taking the German government to court over a "regulatory
holiday" granted to Deutsche Telekom to build a high-speed
Internet network.


Commission spokesman Martin Selmayr said the European Union's
competition watchdog had decided to give Berlin a month to repeal
a new telecommunications law or face action before an EU court.


"If in this time the law ... is not changed and brought in line
with (EU) community law then the Commission will in June decide
to go to court," he told journalists.


The European Union's executive arm says that the new law, which
went into effect in February, effectively exempts from
competition a fast Internet access network that Deutsche Telekom
is building.


Deutsche Telekom, about 32 percent of which is owned by the
German state, enjoys a broad share of the national telephone
market, controlling the access of 9,400,000 lines in Germany out
of a total of 12,900,000 lines.


However, there is considerable scope for the former state
monopoly to strengthen its hand in the Internet access market
with Germany having a broadband penetration rate well below other
leading EU countries.


The Commission estimates that only 16 percent of the German
population has access to broadband Internet access compared with
nearly 30 percent in Denmark and The Netherlands.
