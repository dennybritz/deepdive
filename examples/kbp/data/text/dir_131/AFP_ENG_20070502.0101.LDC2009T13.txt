State secrecy laws in many countries hark back to the Cold War-
era, restrict the work of the media and help promote conspiracy
theories, according to a report released Wednesday.


"Excessive secrecy still remains in many areas," said the report,
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), into public and media access to government-held
information in most of its 56 members states.


The OSCE said some state secrets laws were simply dated but that
factors like the so-called "war on terror" launched by the United
States after the September 11, 2001 attacks have made countries
reluctant to reveal information.


"Many state secrets laws still retain the Cold War mentality and
structures and the recently heightened security concerns have
replaced it as the justification for secrecy," the document said.


It noted that "not all of the laws are effective. Many have
excessive exemptions and do not recognise the need to balance the
public's right to know with the need for secrecy."


The practice, the OSCE said, "can undermine public trust and
promote conspiracy theories".


It underlined that many governments involved in the conflict in
Iraq "have suffered a loss of public confidence" due to the
"origins and subsequent prosecution of the war".


The OSCE comprises countries from Europe, Central Asia and North
America, and aims to help provide stability through tasks ranging
from election monitoring to conflict resolution.
