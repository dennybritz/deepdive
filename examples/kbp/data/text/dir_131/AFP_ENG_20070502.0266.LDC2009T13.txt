Sudan rejected the first arrest warrants issued Wednesday by the
International Criminal Court (ICC) over the Darfur conflict for a
Sudanese minister of state and a militia leader accused of
murder, torture and rape.


"Sudan rejects the ICC prosecutor's decision and our position is
in line with international law because Sudan is not a member of
the treaty that founded this jurisdiction," Mohammed Ali al-
Mardhi told reporters.


In documents released Wednesday, ICC judges said there were
"reasonable grounds" to conclude that Ahmed Haroun, Sudan's
secretary of state for humanitarian affairs and a former minister
in charge of Darfur, and Ali Kosheib, a principal leader of the
Khartoum-backed Janjaweed militia, were "criminally responsible"
for war crimes and crimes against humanity.


The arrest warrants, dated April 27, charge the pair with a long
list of 51 counts including murder, torture, mass rape and the
forced displacement of entire villages during a series of attacks
in western Darfur in 2003 and 2004.
