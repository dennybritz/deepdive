Forty-five people were injured in Madrid overnight Tuesday when
hundreds of young people clashed with police for the second
consecutive night, emergency services said.


About 20 youths were detained for questioning, while a police
officer was taken to hospital with a broken hand, Spanish
national radio RNE reported.


The violence erupted about 3:00 am (0100 GMT) on Wednesday when
groups of young people gathered in the central Malasana
neighbourhood, which is famous for its nightlife, began to throw
missiles at the large police presence.


They set rubbish bins on fire and anti-riot police responded with
tear gas.


On Monday night, about 20 people including eight police officers
had been slightly injured in similar clashes, and a dozen people
were held.


Malasana is where young people, often teenagers, gather en masse
to drink alcohol in the streets on weekends and public holidays.
These include May 2, the anniversary of an uprising in Madrid
against Napoleonic troops.


The practice has been banned in the Spanish capital and other
towns for the past few years because of the disorder that often
follows, but despite a strong police presence, the crowds still
gather.
