A primary school in Indonesia has designated areas for students
and teachers to spit in an attempt to contain the unhygienic but
popular habit, a report said Wednesday.


Spittoons and tissues would be provided for those using the four
spitting areas at the school in East Java province, Detikcom
online news portal said.


Similar to the concept of designated smoking rooms, the spitting
areas were an attempt to ensure non-spitters were unaffected by
the habit, it said.


"This program is for all elements within the school environment,"
said Sudar Ardiansyah, principal of the Islamic school.


Those caught spitting in unofficial areas would pick up rubbish
in the school as punishment, while repeat offenders would have
their parents summoned to the school, Detikcom said.


The habit of spitting is widespread in rural Indonesia.
