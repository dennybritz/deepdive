Rescue workers Wednesday dug through the rubble of a collapsed
apartment building in northeast Spain for two people still
missing following a gas explosion that killed seven others, local
authorities said.


The body of a man was recovered from the debris Wednesday
morning, adding to those of six women found after the blast which
ripped through the five-storey building in central Palencia early
Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the regional administration said.


Around 12 people were also injured in the explosion, including a
six-year-old child who was in a serious condition. Dozens of
others were treated by emergency services for minor injuries.


Rescue teams with sniffer dogs searched for an 88-year-old woman
and a Romanian immigrant feared trapped in the debris. The
workers were concentrating their search on the lower part of the
building.


"We fear that there were two additional victims even if it is not
certain that these two people were actually present in the
building at the time of the explosion," the spokeswoman told AFP.


The apartment block was completely destroyed in the explosion,
blamed on a gas leak and which also damaged surrounding
buildings. Around 200 people were rehoused.


Local authorities in the town of 80,000 people declared three
days of mourning.
