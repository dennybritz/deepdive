Rangers are giving Turkey defender Erol Bulut a trial with a view
to possibly signing the 32-year-old for next season.


Bulut, a free agent from the end of this campaign, when his
contract with Greek champions Olympiakos expires, has spent the
week at the Ibrox club and will watch Saturday's Old Firm clash
with Celtic.


Assistant manager Ally McCoist said Bulut had a good chance of
winning a deal that will bring him to Scotland.


"He has been at Newcastle and we have had some good reports so we
are looking forward to working with him over the next couple of
days," McCoist said.


"We are both going into this with open minds and hopefully Erol
can impress in training."
