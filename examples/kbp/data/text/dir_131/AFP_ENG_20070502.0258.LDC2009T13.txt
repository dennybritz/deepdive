Sparta Prague have agreed terms for goalkeeper Jaromir Blazek to
join German Bundesliga club Nuremberg, the Czech first division
team announced on Wednesday.


Blazek, the second choice Czech national keeper after Petr Cech,
is set to sign a two-year contract with the German team if he
comes through medical tests due to take place on Wednesday, the
Czech club said.


"I wanted to play abroad and the move to Nuremberg will allow me
to fulfill this dream," the 34-year-old keeper said.


Financial terms of the transfer, due to take place after the
close of this season, were not revealed.
