The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) condemned Wednesday
the arrests of Turkish trade union leaders and members at a May
Day rally in Istanbul.


"It is unacceptable for the police to arrest peacefully
demonstrating trade unionists and to scatter hundreds of other
demonstrators by using tear gas," ETUC chief John Monks said in a
statement.


ETUC, whose members include Turkish trade unions, also expressed
concern "about the turn political events seem to be taking in
Turkey at the present time".


Almost 900 people were arrested Tuesday as Turkish police fired
warning shots and fought pitched battles with May Day marchers
intent on holding a banned rally in Istanbul's symbolic Taksim
Square.


It happened when police tried to prevent union groups marching to
the square to mark the 30th anniversary there of "Bloody May
Day," when 34 people died after unknown gunmen fired on a
peaceful crowd, triggering mass panic.


The violence came against a backdrop of tension between the army
and government over a disputed presidential election that was
annulled by the country's top court, paving the way for early
legislative elections.
