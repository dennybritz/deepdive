French luxury goods empire PPR has reached an agreement to buy
the 27.5 percent stake in Puma held by the Herz family, which
would trigger a public offer for shares in the German sportswear
manufacturer, the French business daily Les Echos reported
Tuesday.


Citing sources close to the deal, the daily said the deal which
values the company at 5.4 billion euros would be made public
later in the day ahead of a meeting of shareholders in the
world's number three sportswear maker behind Nike and Adidas.


The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday in Nuremberg.


The French retail group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR), which
owns a range of top-end fashion brands including Yves Saint
Laurent and Gucci, has declined to confirm or deny rumours that
it has designs on Puma.


On Thursday, shares in Puma leaped by more than 10 percent to a
record high of nearly 315 euros on rumours PPR was negotiating
with Daniela and Gunther Herz, who control the company.


Puma posted sales of 2.37 billion euros in 2006 and is upbeat on
prospects for this year.


In March, PPR said it was holding 1.070 billion euros in cash,
providing it with a well-stocked war chest if the retailer
decided to bid for another group.
