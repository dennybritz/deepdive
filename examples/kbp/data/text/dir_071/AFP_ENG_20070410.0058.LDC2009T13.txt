Another four US soldiers have died in violence in Iraq, the
military said on Tuesday, bringing to 32 the number of American
troops killed in the country this month alone.


Two roadside bomb blasts killed three soldiers and wounded
another while they were on patrol Monday in southeastern Baghdad
where a massive security crackdown is underway to quell daily
bloodshed.


The military announced that a fourth soldier died while
conducting combat operations on Monday in the restive province of
Al-Anbar, a known hotbed for Sunni insurgents and Al-Qaeda
militants west of Baghdad.


The latest fatalities brought to 3,280 the number of American
military losses since the March 2003 invasion, according to an
AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
