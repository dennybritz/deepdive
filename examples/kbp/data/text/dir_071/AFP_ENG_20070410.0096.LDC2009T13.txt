China said Tuesday that six-party talks aimed at ending North
Korea's atomic programme were not about to fail, even if a key
weekend deadline to push forward a disarmament deal was not met.


"We have encountered some difficulties which is very natural
because the six- party talks have never been a smooth process, it
is full of difficulties and twists and turns," foreign ministry
spokesman Qin Gang told journalists.


Qin was speaking as North Korea increasingly appeared unlikely to
meet a Saturday deadline to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear power
plant as part of initial disarmament actions agreed to during
six-nation talks in February.


"But I do not agree that if the initial actions are delayed in
implementation, then the six-party talks will fail or will be
invalid," Qin said.


North Korea has refused to budge on its commitment to close
Yongbyon until it receives 25 million dollars in funds that were
frozen in a Macau bank in 2005 under US anti-money laundering
sanctions.


Washington lifted the sanctions in March, but the return of the
money has been held up in a morass of international banking rules
and red tape.
