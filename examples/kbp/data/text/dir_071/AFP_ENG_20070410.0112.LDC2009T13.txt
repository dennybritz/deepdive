India's Suzlon Energy, the fifth-largest wind energy firm in the
world, said Tuesday it had raised its offer for German wind-
turbine builder REpower to 1.22 billion euros (1.6 billion
dollars).


Suzlon Wind Energie, the German unit of Suzlon, said in a
statement that the Indian wind turbine manufacturer had increased
its bid to 150 euros per REpower share from 126 euros previously.


The improved offer exceeded a rival bid of 140 euros per share
from French company Areva, Suzlon said.
