A bomb exploded outside a Bangkok shopping centre that had also
been targeted in a wave of New Year's Eve attacks, police said
Tuesday.


No one was injured when the device blew up at a phone booth in
front of the shopping and cinema complex in the northern Major
Ratchayothin district.


"There is a row of three phone booths and the bomb exploded in
one of them. The glass was shattered, but there were no
casualties," Bangkok city police spokesman Colonel Supisan
Pakdinarunart said.


The centre was among nine places in Bangkok bombed on New Year's
Eve, when three people were killed and dozens injured in blasts
around the capital.


Those blasts were followed by a coordinated arson and bombing
spree across the insurgency-hit southern provinces at the start
of the Lunar New Year. They left nine people dead and 44 injured
and were blamed on Islamic separatists.


Army officials have warned of possible attacks during upcoming
Buddhist New Year celebrations, which begin Friday and run over
five days.
