The husband of Philippines President Gloria Arroyo underwent
heart surgery and was recovering at a hospital here Tuesday, his
doctors said.


The wealthy 60 year-old lawyer was operated on for more than
eight hours for an aortic aneurism on Monday night, said his
doctor Juliet Cervantes of Saint Luke's Hospital.


He had been rushed to hospital a day earlier for suspected
chronic gastritis.


President Arroyo, also 60, cancelled her public appointments on
Monday to be at his bedside, aides said.
