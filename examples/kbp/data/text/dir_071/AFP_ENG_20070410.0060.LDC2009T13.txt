Japan said Tuesday it would "prudently" consider a US request for
its participation in a complaint at the World Trade Organisation
accusing China of copyright abuse.


"We have received a request for cooperation from the United
States," Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Akira
Amari told reporters.


"But since we are just about to hold a Japan-China summit, we
have to prudently determine the details of the request," Amari
said.


"And we also have to carefully assess efforts made by China," he
added.


Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will begin a four-day visit to Japan
on Wednesday to hold summit talks with Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe.


The United States announced on Monday it would file a case at the
World Trade Organisation over widespread copyright piracy in
China, a practice which US companies say deprives them of
billions of dollars each year.


Washington also said it would lodge another complaint at the WTO
accusing China of restricting distribution of foreign music,
films and books.
