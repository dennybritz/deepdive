Olympic swimming champions Grant Hackett and Jodie Henry and
World Championship stars Libby Lenton and Leisel Jones will lead
Australia's team to Europe's Mare Nostrum Series, officials said
Tuesday.


This year's edition of the meeting will unfurl in France's Canet
on June 9-10, in Barcelona on June 13 and 14 and in Monaco on
June 16-17 and usually boasts top global and European swimming
stars, Swimming Australia said.


Hackett's inclusion is a change from his usual routine and will
allow him to practice against some of his main rivals 14 months
ahead of his bid to win a historic third consecutive Olympic
1,500m freestyle crown.


The Olympian is rebounding from his disappointing performances at
the recent world championships in Melbourne, including his first
defeat in his pet 1,500m in a decade.


The Australian squad will include 22 swimmers who swam at this
year's World Championships as well as Athens Olympic relay gold
medallist Alice Mills and youngsters Angie Bainbridge and Belinda
Hocking.


Other swimmers could still be added to the line-up, Swimming
Australia said.


Australians dominated the Mare Nostrum in 2006 with Jones, Lenton
and backstroker Tay Zimmer taking the top three spots in the
individual trophy pointscore.


Lenton picked up five gold medals at the World Championships in
Melbourne that ended April 1 to become the most successful
Australian female swimmer to compete in the championships.
