A woman suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt blew herself up
opposite a police station in Iraq's restive province of Diyala on
Tuesday, killing 15 people, a police officer said.


The attack happened in the town of Muqdadiya in a province that
is now considered the second most dangerous area of Iraq after
Baghdad itself.


The woman, wearing an explosive belt approached a group of people
outside a kiosk opposite the police station who were seeking
recruitment forms to sign up for the police force, said First
Lieutenant Mohammed Ahmed.


Civilians and police recruits were among the victims, he added.
Seven people were wounded.


Interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Abdul Karim Khalaf
had earlier told AFP that the toll from the attack was nine.
