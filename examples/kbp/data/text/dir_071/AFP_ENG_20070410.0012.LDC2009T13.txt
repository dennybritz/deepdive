The US decision to file a WTO complaint against China over
copyright piracy is not sensible and ignores Beijing's efforts to
combat the problem, the top Chinese copyright official said
Tuesday.


"It's not a sensible move for the US government to file such a
complaint," the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Intellectual
Property Office commissioner Tian Lipu, as saying.


"By doing so, the United States has ignored the Chinese
government's immense efforts and great achievements in
strengthening IPR protection and tightening enforcement of its
copyright laws."
