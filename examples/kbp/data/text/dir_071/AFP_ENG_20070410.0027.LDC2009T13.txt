China's March trade surplus fell 38.6 percent from a year earlier
to 6.9 billion dollars, less than a third of the February figure,
customs figures showed Tuesday.


In March, exports rose 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 83.4
billion dollars but were outpaced by imports, up 14.5 percent at
76.6 billion dollars, according to the customs authorities'
website.


The surplus, sharply declining from February's near-record 23.8
billion dollars, resulted from a government decision to seek
better balance between exports and imports, according to state
media.


"The effect of last year's policy will be seen this year," said
Vice Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng, according to the China Daily.


"The surplus of roughly 40 billion dollars in January and
February is not indicative of the trend for the first quarter and
the rest of the year," Gao was quoted by the paper as saying.


For the first three months, exports totaled 252.1 billion
dollars, 27.8 percent higher than the same period in 2006.


Imports in the first quarter 205.7 billion dollars, a rise of
18.2 percent from a year earlier.
