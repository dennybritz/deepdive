US envoy Christopher Hill said Tuesday it was becoming difficult
to meet the "precise deadline" this week for North Korea to shut
down a nuclear site as part of an aid for disarmament deal.


North Korea has refused to budge until it receives funds that had
been frozen in a Macau bank due to US sanctions.


"Obviously every day this banking matter holds us up, and it
makes it more difficult to meet the precise deadline," Hill told
reporters in Tokyo.


North Korea pledged in a six-nation deal in February to shut down
its key Yongbyon nuclear facility and allow the return of UN
nuclear inspectors by April 14 in return for badly needed fuel
aid.
