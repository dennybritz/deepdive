China's March trade surplus fell 38.6 percent from a year earlier
to 6.9 billion dollars and was less than a third of the February
figure, customs figures showed Tuesday.


The surplus in February was a near-record 23.8 billion dollars.


In March, exports rose 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 83.4
billion dollars but were outpaced by imports, up 14.5 percent at
76.6 billion dollars, according to the customs authorities'
website.
