Hong Kong share prices finished the Tuesday morning session 0.60
percent higher on pent-up demand for blue chips and China stocks
following the market's five- day break, dealers said.


They said investors were encouraged by the strong performance of
markets in China and elsewhere in the last few days and news of
good sales of apartments in Hong Kong over the long holiday.


The market was closed from Thursday until Monday for public
holidays.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 121.24 points at
20,330.95, off a low of 20,248.04 and a high of 20,416.54.
