At least nine Maoist guerrillas were killed in an internecine
clash in the insurgency-racked Indian state of Jharkhand, police
said Tuesday.


Six others were wounded in the firefight late Monday in Latehar
district after members of India's largest Maoist force attacked
the leadership of a splinter unit called the Third Preparation
Committee.


The committee has refused to join forces with India's two largest
left-wing guerrilla groups -- the People's War Group and the
Maoist Communist Centre -- since September 2005.


Senior police officer G.S. Rath said rebels from the merged
organisation attacked the headquarters of the splinter unit in a
village killing seven guerrillas on the spot.


Two others died of their injuries later in hospital, Rath said in
Ranchi, capital of the eastern Indian state.


The committee's chief commander was also killed, Rath said and
identified him as Arjun.


Internecine fighting among outlawed insurgents almost ceased two
years ago when the Communist Party of India-Maoist umbrella forum
was set up.


The Maoist insurgency began in the 1960s in India as an armed
peasant movement.


The rebels who say they are fighting for the rights of landless
farmers operate in 15 of India's 29 states.


Last month they killed 55 policemen in neighbouring Chhattisgarh
state in one of their biggest recent attacks.
