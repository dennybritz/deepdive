The husband of Philippines President Gloria Arroyo underwent
heart surgery and was recovering at a hospital here Tuesday, his
doctors said.


Jose Miguel Arroyo, a wealthy 60 year-old lawyer, was operated on
for more than eight hours for an aortic aneurism on Monday night,
said his doctor Juliet Cervantes of Saint Luke's Hospital.


He had been rushed to hospital a day earlier for suspected
chronic gastritis.


President Arroyo, also 60, cancelled her public appointments on
Monday to be at his bedside, aides said.


Cervantes said the surgery was "uneventful" and that he was
recovering "faster than we thought."


She said the president's husband will be "monitored closely over
the next 48 hours, which is the most critical period in this kind
of surgery."


Gerry Pelayo, an Arroyo political ally, told reporters that the
president remained at her husband's side overnight, staying in a
hospital room while the surgery was carried out.


"The president is very tired but as a wife, she feels it is right
to be at the side of her husband," he said.
