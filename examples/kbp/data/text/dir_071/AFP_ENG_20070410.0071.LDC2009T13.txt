A prosecutor has charged a Jordanian man with  murdering his
daughter for "honour" after forcing her to undergo an abortion
for a pregnancy out of wedlock, the Jordan Times reported on
Tuesday.


The criminal prosecutor charged the 68-year-old suspect with
premeditated murder after he shot dead his 26-year-old daughter
on Monday "for reasons related to family honour," the daily said.


The victim was shot six times in the head and the neck and when
police arrived at their home, the suspect "fired several rounds
in the air, saying he was celebrating the killing of his
daughter," one official said.


"I have cleared the family's name and cleansed my honour," the
official quoted the suspect as saying, the newspaper said.


According to the report, the victim was allegdly involved with a
married man and two weeks ago her family discovered she was
pregnant.


"The family... arranged for her to undergo an abortion and an
operation to restore her virginity," and then locked her up at
home before the suspect shot her dead, the source said.


The victim was the seventh woman reportedly murdered in a so-
called "honour crime" in conservative Muslim Jordan since
January, the daily said.
