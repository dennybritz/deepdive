Ukraine's constitutional court will begin on Wednesday to
consider the legality of President Viktor Yushchenko's decree
dissolving parliament, the court said Tuesday.


"On Wednesday, April 11 the constitutional court... will begin to
examine" the matter, a court statement said. There was no
indication of when a ruling might be announced.


The anti-Yushchenko majority in the 450-seat parliament has
refused to comply with the president's April 2 decree and says
that new parliamentary elections, slated for May 27, will not
take place.


The stand-off has plunged the ex-Soviet republic into a
constitutional and political crisis, with large numbers of anti-
Yushchenko protestors camping out in central Kiev.


Leading the defiance is Moscow-backed Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych, arch rival of the Western-leaning Yushchenko.


The two first faced off in 2004-2005 when Yanukovych's defeat of
Yushchenko in a presidential race was overturned amid huge
demonstrations dubbed the Orange Revolution. Yushchenko then won
the re-run.


The European Union, Russia and the United States have all voiced
concern over the latest tensions in Ukraine.
