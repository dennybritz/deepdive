At least 1,086 people were killed in four days of recent heavy
clashes between Ethiopian forces and Islamist fighters backed by
clan militia in the Somali capital, elders from the dominant
Hawiye clan said Tuesday.


The fighting, which erupted late last month when Ethiopian forces
launched a bloody crackdown on suspected insurgents in Mogadishu,
also left 4,334 people wounded, Hussein Aden Korgab, the Hawiye
clan spokesman, told AFP.


"Our assessment team counted 1,086 people killed ... (and) 4,334
wounded," he said.
