A Russian Proton rocket blasted off early Tuesday carrying a
communications satellite for Telesat Canada, a spokesman for the
Russian Federal Space Center said.


The rocket lifted off at 04:54 am (2254 GMT Monday) and the Anik
3 satellite, a Eurostar E3000 built by EADS Astrium, should
separate from the rocket some nine hours later to achieve a
geostationary orbit, said spokesman Oleg Urusov.


The satellite, which has an expected life span of 15 years, will
provide radio, television, Internet and other telecommunications
services in Canada and the United States.
