Chinese share prices shrugged off morning losses to rise 1.33
percent Tuesday for a seventh consecutive record finish as the
market continued to power ahead despite occasional profit-taking,
dealers said.


They said trade was once again very heavy, running at record
levels around 30 billion dollars, with the early reverse seen as
just a modest technical correction as investors continued to pour
into the market.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, closed up 45.34 points at 3,444.29. Turnover hit a
record 152.94 billion yuan (19.79 billion US dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 47.89 points or 1.34 percent to
3,620.30 on turnover of 152.30 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index added 11.67 points or 1.23 percent at 960.77,
another record, on turnover of 76.16 billion yuan.
