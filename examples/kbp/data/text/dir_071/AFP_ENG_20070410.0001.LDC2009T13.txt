Florida Panthers players Ed Belfour and Ville Peltonen were
arrested early Monday during a boozy night in Miami's South Beach
entertainment district, the Miami Herald reported.


Belfour, of Carman, Canada, and teammate Peltonen were jailed on
separate charges. Police used a Taser gun to subdue Belfour who
was charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.


Police said Peltonen, of Vantaa, Finland, allegedly attacked a
fire truck with a metal pole. The left winger won a silver medal
for Finland in the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics.


Police said they did not have a motive for the attack on the fire
truck but that the man was smiling as he swung the bar.


The players were celebrating the end of the National Hockey
League's 2006-07 season in which the Panthers failed to make the
playoffs, the Herald reported.


Belfour was arrested after he refused to leave the Nikki Beach
club. Police said they tried to force a 41-year-old man out of
the club when he grabbed an officer's shirt. The man was stunned
with a Taser and, eventually, subdued.


The goalie won a gold medal with Canada at the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
