A woman suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt blew herself up
opposite a police station in Iraq's restive province of Diyala on
Tuesday, killing 15 people, a police officer said.


The attack happened in the town of Muqdadiya in a province that
is now considered the second most dangerous area of Iraq after
Baghdad itself.


The woman, strapped with an explosive belt, approached a group of
people outside a kiosk opposite the police station who were
seeking recruitment forms to sign up for the police force, said
First Lieutenant Mohammed Ahmed.


Civilians and police recruits were among the victims, he added.
Seven people were wounded.


Interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Abdul Karim Khalaf
confirmed from Baghdad that a woman dressed in the traditional,
all-enveloping black abaya had blown herself up in the mixed
Shiite-Sunni Muslim town.


The attack was the latest evidence of stepped up sectarian and
insurgent killings outside Baghdad where a massive US-Iraqi
security crackdown, now into an eighth week, has seen American
officials boast about signs of progress.


Diyala, in particular, has been rocked by a recent spike in
violence.


On April 2, suspected Sunni militants executed 21 Shiite workers
while they were travelling home to Diyala after a day's work in
Baghdad.


On March 29, coordinated bomb attacks in a market in the Diyala
town of Khalis killed more than 40 people.
