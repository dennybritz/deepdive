Chinese biofuel producers have ignored a government limit on the
amount of corn they are allowed to turn into ethanol, causing a
steep rise in the price of the grain, state media said Tuesday.


Last year they converted 16 million tonnes of corn into ethanol
despite an official order to convert no more than three million
tonnes, the China Daily reported, giving no sources.


The newspaper, blaming the problem mostly on "small, unlicensed
producers," said burgeoning industrial demand had caused corn
prices to rise by up to 15 percent since the second half of last
year.


There is no solution in sight, with demand for industrial use of
corn likely to rise by 30 percent annually until 2010, the
newspaper reported, citing the Chinese Grain Commerce
Association.


In an effort to meet the growing demand, China aims to step up
its annual corn production from 144 million tonnes now to 150
million tonnes by the end of the decade, it added.


As the nation's farmland is limited, howerver, the increase will
mainly come about by increased yield per hectare, using improved
strains, it said, citing Chen Mengshan, director of the
agriculture ministry's grain production division.


China is struggling to reduce its dependence on heavily polluting
coal, the source of two thirds of its energy, and ethanol mixed
with gasoline is considered to be a relatively clean substitute.
