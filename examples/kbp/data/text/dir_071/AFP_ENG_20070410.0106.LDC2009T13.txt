Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko and his political opponent
Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych met Tuesday in Kiev to discuss a
deepening political and constitutional crisis in the country, the
president's office said.


A worsening power struggle in the ex-Soviet republic pits
Yanukovych's Moscow- backed allies, who control parliament,
against Western-leaning Yushchenko, who has ordered the
dissolution of parliament and fresh elections.
