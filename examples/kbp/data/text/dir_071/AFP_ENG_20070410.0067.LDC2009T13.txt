Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta leads in East Timor's
presidential election with about 20 percent of votes counted, and
there will probably be a runoff, an election official said.


Fernando "Lasama" de Araujo, a former political prisoner in
Indonesia and the chairman of the opposition Democratic Party,
was close behind in second place, said Martinho Gusmao, a
spokesman for the national election commission.


Ex-guerrilla and ruling Fretilin party candidate Francisco "Lu-
Olo" Guterres was in third in the provisional count, he said.


"Perhaps no candidate will get 50 percent," Gusmao said.


A candidate needs more than 50 percent to win or there will be
runoff in early May.


Technical problems have delayed the count in most of the country.


"They couldn't start the tabulation because of the question of
technical support like computers, printers and generators,"
Gusmao said.


Overall results are due this week to select a successor to the
charismatic former guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao, who is not
seeking re-election.


Monday's vote, hailed as peaceful and transparent, was the first
in East Timor since its independence in 2002 following a bloody
split from occupying Indonesia three years earlier.
