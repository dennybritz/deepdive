South Africa's policy of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) is
flawed and in need of review, the country's finance minister said
in an interview published Tuesday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, Trevor Manuel said that the
legislation, clarified two years ago, had been abused.


Since 1994, South Africa has been promoting BEE as a central
plank of its growth strategy and says deals worth 285 billion
rand (30 billion euros, 40 billion dollars) have been concluded
in the last decade.


In the past two years, Manuel told the business daily, "there
were all kinds of things that businesses have done, good and bad,
cynical and genuine."


"There will have to be a review."


As evidence of many companies following only the letter, and not
the spirit of the programme by recruiting black managers and
board members only as token gestures, Manuel cited the example of
a friend of his.


"They (his white partners) say, 'We want you there. You are a
good man. But actually we do not need you close to what we do. We
will run the business, but we have bought an insurance policy
through you'," Manuel told the FT.


According to the FT, the BEE programme has also come in for
criticism because of accusations that its main beneficiaries are
those with strong links to the governing African National
Congress party.
