Four Muslims including two boys were shot dead by suspected
Islamic rebels as they were returning from a burial for another
victim of the unrest in Thailand's restive south, police said
Tuesday.


The ambush late Monday also injured seven in Yala, one of three
Muslim-majority southern provinces bordering Malaysia.


Two of the victims were aged 12 and 14. The others were men in
their 20s, police said.


The victims were on a pick-up truck returning from a burial
ceremony for a 55 -year-old man whose body was ripped in half
when a bomb exploded under his truck earlier.


Including the latest ambush, a total of nine people were killed
in attacks around Yala on Monday.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in Thailand's violence-
torn south since an insurgency broke out in January 2004.


Thailand's military-installed government has launched a raft of
peace measures, only to see the attacks escalate in the past six
months.


The attacks have also become more gruesome, including two
beheadings last month.
