French-Spanish tobacco group Altadis said on Tuesday that its
board had unanimously rejected an improved 47-euro-per-share
takeover off from British rival Imperial Tobacco.


Altadis said its board had studied the informal bid and had
concluded that it "does not reflect the company's strategic
value... nor the diversity of its assets, nor its growth
potential."


Imperial had initially offered 45 euros per share for Altadis on
March 15, valuing the group at 11.5 billion euros (15.2 billion
dollars).


A merger of the companies would bring together the Imperial
cigarette brands of Regal, Embassy and Davidoff with Altadis
best-sellers Gauloises and Fortuna.


Some analysts have suggested that that the board of Altadis is
looking for a bid of at least 50 euros per share.
