A Singapore court on Tuesday fined the former coach of Malaysia's
national football team 50,000 dollars (33,112 US) for match-
fixing after convicting him earlier.


Chow Kwai Lam, 64, was composed as the sentence was handed down
by a district court judge, and expressed relief that he was
spared a jail term.


"I already expected (this) ... I had hoped something of this
nature," he told reporters after the sentence was passed.


Chow was convicted last week of offering 200-300 dollars to the
goal-keeper of a Singapore football club he had formerly coached
as advance payment for letting the opposition score two or three
goals during a match in 2005.


He also promised to pay an unspecified amount after.


Chow, a Malaysian, had testified that he was only trying to test
the player's integrity by asking if he was interested in letting
in goals, but the judge rejected this.


Chow coached the Malaysian national team in 1978 and again when
the country sought to qualify for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.


He also brought Kuala Lumpur from obscurity to win three Malaysia
Cup finals from 1987 to 1989. He was president of the Football
Coaches Association of Malaysia in 1999-2000.
