Young footballers from communist North Korea are experiencing a
culture shock ranging from religion to pop music during a cross-
border training visit to capitalist South Korea, a report said
Tuesday.


"Why are so many crosses out there?" "Why do most children wear
glasses?" "Can I see your mobile phone?"


These were some of the many questions asked by members of the
under-17 squad during a break from training over the weekend,
according to the English-language website of Chosun Ilbo
newspaper.


The 23 players and nine coaches arrived on March 20 for a month-
long visit funded by South Korea.


On the field, the North Koreans are no different from their
southern neighbours.


But off the pitch, they had countless questions for South Korean
officials of the Sports Exchange Association accompanying them on
the trip, the website said.


The crosses denote churches in South Korea, which has East Asia's
largest Christian population after the Philippines.


When told this, one player responded: "What is a church?"


When an official explained that many young South Koreans wear
glasses because they use computers a lot, another team member
reportedly replied: "In North Korea, only a few children and
scholars who read lots of books wear glasses."


Cellphones, especially those with games or camera functions, were
also a source of fascination as was actress and singer Beyonce
Knowles.


When shown magazine photos and asked to pick the most beautiful
actress among two South Koreans and Knowles, they reportedly
chose the American.
