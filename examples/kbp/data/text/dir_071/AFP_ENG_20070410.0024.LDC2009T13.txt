At least 19 people died and 58 were injured when a crowded bus
and a truck transporting beer crashed head on in southern Sri
Lanka on Tuesday, officials said.


Most of the victims were trapped and burnt to death as the bus
caught fire at Induruwa, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of
Colombo, according to police.


"Fifty-eight people with injuries were brought in for treatment,"
said Jayampathy Senanayake, head of the area's main hospital. "A
few people are in a critical condition."


Many residents had initially thought a bomb exploded and had
alerted the local police.


The accident came amid tight security at bus stations following
fears of bomb attacks by Tamil rebels. Fifteen people were killed
when a parcel bomb exploded in the same area in January.


Tuesday's crash was along the coastal Galle Road, the same route
taken by a South Asian car rally which set off on the island
Tuesday.


Sri Lankan roads are some of the most dangerous in the world with
accidents claiming at least 2,000 lives each year on a poorly-
maintained network choked with more than two million vehicles.
