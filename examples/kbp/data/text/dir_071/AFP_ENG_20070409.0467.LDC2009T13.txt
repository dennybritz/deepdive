Portland Trail Blazers rookie forward-centre LaMarcus Aldridge on
Monday was diagnosed with a heart condition.


Aldridge underwent a series of tests and treatment at St.
Vincent's Medical Center where it was learned he had Wolff-
Parkinson-White Syndrome. Doctors said the condition was
treatable.


Aldridge, who will miss the final six games of the season, is
expected to make a full recovery.


Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome is recognized by certain changes
in the heart's electrical activity. A normal heart relies on
proper timing of the electrical signal.
