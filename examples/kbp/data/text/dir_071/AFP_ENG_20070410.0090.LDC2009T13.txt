Central Cheetahs fullback Bevin Fortuin was suspended from the
Super 14 rugby competition for two weeks Tuesday for a dangerous
tackle.


Fortuin admitted a dangerous tackle on Auckland Blues halfback
Steve Devine during the South African side's 26-8 defeat on
Friday, the New Zealand Rugby Union said in a statement.


Devine did not have the ball when he was up-ended by Fortuin, who
admitted lifting the Blues player into a dangerous position and
not ensuring that he was safely returned to the ground.


Fortuin will miss the Cheetahs' matches against the Wellington
Hurricanes in Wellington on Friday and the Queensland Reds in
Brisbane the following week.
