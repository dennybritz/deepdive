Chinese footballers accused of making obscene gestures to the
crowd have been told to control their middle fingers by league
officials, state media reported Tuesday.


Officials were examining two incidents involving crowd violence
this month in which the conduct of players was questioned.


On April 1, fans of Henan Jiangye smashed windows of the visiting
Shandong team bus after the home team were held to a 1-1 draw,
according to the report.


A week later Tianjin's Czech coach Josef Jarabinsky was
reportedly forced to flee from rampaging home fans after his team
beat Zhejiang 3-1.


"We don't have concrete evidence to prove they gave the finger to
fans but I can well believe it," Lang Xiaonong, secretary of
China's Super League, was quoted as saying in the Beijing Morning
Post.


"The cultural level of some of our Chinese footballers is
regrettably low."


"All we can do is to encourage them to improve their manners and
behave calmly whatever fans may do."


Crowd trouble is a common problem in China's Super league. Last
month hooligans surrounded and damaged a car carrying China's
national head coach Zhu Guanghu after a league match in Xiamen,
southeastern China. That match also involved Tianjin, who beat
home team Xiamen 2-1.


"It is obvious that our fans can behave in a pretty unreasonable
way, resulting in some unfortunate incidents," said Lang.
