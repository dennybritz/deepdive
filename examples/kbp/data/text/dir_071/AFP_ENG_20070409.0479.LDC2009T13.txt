Australian building materials maker Rinker Group said Tuesday it
had agreed to a revised 14.2 billion US dollar takeover offer
from Mexican cement firm Cemex SA.


The new bid offers 15.85 dollars per share, 2.85 dollars above
the intitial offer of 13 dollars which was rejected earlier as
opportunistic and significantly undervaluing the company.


Rinker chairman John Morschel said the main aim was to maximize
value for shareholders, noting that the impact of the downturn in
the US housing market over the current financial year is
difficult to predict.


"In light of the above, and following evaluation of the available
alternatives, including relevant regulatory, timing and other
execution risks, directors concluded that in the absence of a
superior proposal, the higher Cemex cash offer represents the
best risk-adjusted return for shareholders," he said.


Cemex, which wants to acquire Rinker to expand its presence in
the United States where the Australian company earns more than 80
percent of its income, said it has also agreed to waive all
conditions to the bid, except the 90 percent minimum acceptance
condition.


The Mexican group said that if the required level of acceptances
was not reached, the offer would lapse.


Any Rinker shareholders who have already accepted the initial
CEMEX offer will be eligible for the increased offer, which is
scheduled to close at 7:00 pm (0900 GMT) on May 18.


Last week, the US Department of Justice gave a conditional
approval to the takeover on anti-trust issues.
