Milwaukee Bucks star guard Michael Redd will miss the final six
games of the season after aggravating his left knee injury.


Redd missed 20 games earlier in the season with a strained
patellar tendon suffered January 5. He returned February 20 but
has missed three of the last five contests.


Redd played in Saturday's home loss to New York, scoring 25
points on 9-of-24 shooting.


Redd was averaging a career-high 26.7 points in his seventh
season, all with the Bucks. It is the highest scoring average for
Milwaukee player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar averaged 30.0 points
during the 1974-75 season.
