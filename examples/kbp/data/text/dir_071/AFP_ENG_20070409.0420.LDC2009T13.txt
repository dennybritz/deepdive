One of three Mauritanians held in  Guantanamo Bay has been
released from the US base after five years of detention, a group
of lawyers and human rights activists said on Monday.


Mohamed Lemine Ould Side Mohamed was arrested in Pakistan in
2002.


The US authorities were still waiting for Mauritania to accept
him back, the group said.


"Our embassy in Washington has expressed doubt as to his
nationality, which has delayed his liberation," the group's
president, Hamoud Ould Nabaghi, told a news conference here.


Two other Mauritanians are still being illegally held in
Guantanamo, he said.
