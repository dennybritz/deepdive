Japanese share prices closed down 0.45 percent on Tuesday as
investors locked in gains a day after the market hit the highest
level for almost six weeks, dealers said.


They said that a decision by the Bank of Japan to leave its key
interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent had been widely expected
and made little impact on the market.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 79.07 points to finish at 17,664.69. The broader TOPIX index
of all first-section issues declined 2.41 points or 0.14 percent
to 1,735.69.
