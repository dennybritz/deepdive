Two roadside bomb blasts killed three US soldiers and wounded
another in southeastern Baghdad, the military reported on
Tuesday.


The soldiers died on Monday when their patrol was struck by two
explosions at an intersection in the Iraqi capital where a
massive security crackdown is underway to quell daily bloodshed.


The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq to 31
this month alone and to 3,279 since the March 2003 invasion,
according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
