At least 17 people died when a crowded bus and a truck
transporting beer crashed head on in southern Sri Lanka Tuesday,
police said.


Most of the victims were trapped and burnt to death as the bus
caught fire at Induruwa, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of
Colombo, police said.


Thirty people escaped with injuries and were admitted to
hospital, police said.


The crash was along the same route to be taken Tuesday by a South
Asian car rally.
