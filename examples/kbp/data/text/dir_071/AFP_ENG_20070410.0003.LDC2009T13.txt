Dirk Nowitzki scored 26 points and Jerry Stackhouse added 18 off
the bench as Dallas clinched top spot in the Western Conference
with a 96-86 win over the Los Angeles Clippers Monday.


After missing Saturday's game with an ankle injury, Josh Howard
returned to score 16 points for Dallas (64-13), which moved six
games ahead of second-place Phoenix (58-19) with five contests
left to clinch home-court advantage.


Los Angeles (37-39) is just one-half game ahead of Golden State
(37-40) and two games ahead of the New Orleans Hornets (36-41)for
the eighth and final spot in the West.


Nowitzki shot 10-of-18 from the field and Stackhouse was five-
of-12, including two-of-two from the arc for the Mavericks, who
shot 50 percent (33-of-66) from the field, including five-of-
eight on three-pointers.


Dallas centre Erick Dampier scored two points in three minutes
before leaving with a strained right shoulder with 8:24 left in
the first quarter.


Corey Maggette scored 24 points and Elton Brand added 20 for the
Clippers, who shot 47 percent (34-of-72) and committed 15
turnovers.
