Tamil Tiger rebels shelled government military positions across a
de facto frontline in northern Sri Lanka on Tuesday, killing one
soldier and wounding three, the defence ministry said.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fired mortars at army
positions at Omanthai, the unofficial border between the
government and Tiger-controlled parts of the island, the ministry
said.


"One soldier was killed and three were injured in the attack," a
statement said.


Following the attack, the Omanthai "entry-exit point" was
temporarily closed, the ministry said, adding that the Tigers
wanted to obstruct the transport of supplies across the
frontline.


The latest attack came a day after the International Red Cross
expressed concern over a sharp rise in civilian deaths in the
northern and eastern regions.


"Only last week some 30 people were killed and more than 50
injured as a result of two bomb attacks on civilian buses and
other violent incidents," the Geneva- based International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.


On Saturday, suspected Tiger rebels blew up a passenger bus in
Vavuniya district, killing eight and wounding 25.


According to defence ministry figures, more than 4,000 people
died between December 2005 and the first week of March 2007,
including 675 civilians and 1,040 security personnel.


The Tamil Tigers have waged a 35-year campaign for independence
that has claimed more than 60,000 lives.
