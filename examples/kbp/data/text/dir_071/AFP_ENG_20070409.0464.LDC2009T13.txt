Singapore's economy grew 6.0 percent in the first quarter of the
year compared to the same period last year, according to
provisional government figures released Tuesday.


Preliminary estimates released by the trade and industry minister
showed gross domestic product increased 7.2 percent on a
annualised basis, compared with a 7.9 percent gain in the
previous quarter.


"The Singapore economy continued to grow at a healthy pace," the
ministry said in a statement.


The advanced estimates are computed largely from January and
February. The government will release a full report of first
quarter performance in May.


In 2006 Singapore's economy expanded at a better-than-expected
7.9 percent, one of the fastest rates in Asia.
