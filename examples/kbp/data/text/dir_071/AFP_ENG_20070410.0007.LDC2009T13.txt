Chinese share prices closed the Tuesday morning session lower on
profit-taking, with power and telecom stocks losing ground after
sustained record gains, dealers said.


They said the profit-taking is just a technical correction and is
to be expected in a record-breaking run.


"The market was weighed down by profit-taking after recent
continuous gains but it is simply a technical correction," Shen
Jun, an analyst at Shangzhenglian Consulting, said.


"In the near future, the market is expected to maintain its
bullish trend in a slow and steady manner, but there might be
some big corrections at the end of this month after most
companies issue their annual and quarterly reports," Shen added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
down 18.18 points or 0.53 percent at 3,380.77, after touching a
new all-time high of 3,422.83.


The Shanghai A-share Index was down 19.15 points or 0.54 percent
at 3,553.26 and the Shenzhen A-share Index fell 5.93 points or
0.62 percent at 943.17.
