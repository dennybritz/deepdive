An angry customer drove his car into the head office of South
Korea's leading mobile phone service operator on Tuesday to
protest at what he called poor service, police said.


The attack damaged a revolving door in the lobby of SK Telecom's
building in central Seoul, Yonhap news agency quoted officers as
saying. No one was hurt.


The 47-year-old man drove his Mercedes-Benz into the building
with a note that read "Inferior SK" attached to the front window.


Police said he was angry at the company's refusal to fix his
mobile phone despite his claim that the roaming service did not
work properly. It was not clear what charges he might face.
