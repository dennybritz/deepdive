The German trade surplus fell in February, as imports rose faster
than exports, official data showed on Friday.


The surplus -- the balance between the value of goods exported
and that of goods imported -- stood at 14.2 billion euros (19
billion dollars) in February, down from 16.2 billion euros in
January, the federal statistics office, Destatis, calculated in
preliminary figures.


That was because imports rose by 5.6 percent, while exports edged
up only 1.9 percent, the data showed.


On an annual basis, however, the trade surplus was wider than the
12.7 billion euros recorded in February 2006, the statisticians
calculated.


Taking into account trade in services and income, Germany's
current account showed a surplus of 8.4 billion euros in
February, down from 11.2 billion euros in January, but higher
than the 8.1 billion euros recorded in February 2006.
