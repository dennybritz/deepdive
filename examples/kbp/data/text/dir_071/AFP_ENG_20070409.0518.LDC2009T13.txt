An electrical fault forced the shutdown of a reactor at one of
France's nuclear power plants, the country's nuclear safety
authority said on Tuesday.


The Nuclear Safety Authority said Electricite de France (EDF)
informed it that an electrical fault Monday evening forced the
shutdown of reactor number 3 at its Dampierre facility and that
safety systems had been engaged.


The incident was rated as one out of seven on the international
nuclear event scale, or an anomaly caused by technical failure or
human error without direct safety consequences.
