The Bank of Japan said on Tuesday that it will leave its
benchmark interest rate on hold at 0.5 percent, a decision widely
expected by markets after the first drop in consumer prices for
10 months.


It was the second meeting in a row that the central bank has left
its monetary policy unchanged after a quarter point hike in
February, which was the first increase since July when it ended
over five years of virtually free credit.


The nine-member board voted unanimously to keep the overnight
call rate at 0.5 percent, the Bank of Japan said in a brief
statement.


BoJ governor Toshihiko Fukui has said he hopes to keep raising
interest rates gradually but he faces political resistance to
further monetary tightening, particularly after consumer prices
fell 0.1 percent in February.


The BoJ's closely watched Tankan survey of business sentiment
released last week also showed big manufacturers have become less
upbeat for the first time in a year due to caution over slowing
US economic growth.


Analysts say that political sensitivities linked to July
elections in Japan's upper house of parliament mean that the
BoJ's next increase in interest rates is unlikely to come before
the second half of 2007.


Dealers said the market was now keen to hear remarks from the BoJ
governor at a post-meeting news conference later Tuesday.
