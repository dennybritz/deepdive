Moroccan security forces killed one militant and another blew
himself up during a raid Tuesday in the city of Casablanca,
police said.


In a statement, police said the pair died at dawn as they were
being chased by security forces in the el Fida district of
Casablanca. The statement said both were carrying explosives.


"One of the two was hit by bullets and died from his injuries
while the other blew himself up just as police officers were in
the process of arresting him," the police statement said.


It added that police had been looking for the pair in connection
with an investigation into an attack on a Casablanca internet
cafe on 11 March.


That attack killed a member of a militant gang who was carrying
explosives at the time. An accomplice and three clients in the
cafe were injured.


Thirty one people have been arrested since the March 11 attack.
