Two police officers drowned after their patrol motor boat hit a
rock and capsized on Lake Malawi, police said Tuesday.


Four other colleagues survived the accident which happened around
3:00 am on Monday at Monkey Bay area in the prime tourist
district of Mangochi, according to chief police spokesman Willie
Mwaluka.


He said the marine officers were on "routine Easter patrols" of
Monkey Bay, at the tip of the vast lake, which covers around a
third of the impoverished southern African nation.


"Investigations are still under way to establish the cause of the
accident," Mwaluka told AFP.


Divers from the marine unit of the Malawi Army, which is
headquartered at Monkey Bay, had joined the search for bodies of
the policemen, Mwaluka added.


A constable at Monkey Bay police station, who identified himself
as Levison Ntara, said the two appeared to have drowned as they
lacked life jackets. The four survivors had been wearing jackets.
