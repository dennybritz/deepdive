Former Test player Justin Vaughan was named Tuesday as the new
chief executive of New Zealand Cricket.


Vaughan is a board member of New Zealand Cricket and chairman Sir
John Anderson said he had all the attributes needed to lead the
organisation.


He takes over in June from another former Test player Martin
Snedden, who has been appointed as chief executive of the
organisation staging the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand.


Vaughan played in six Tests and 18 one-day internationals between
1992 and 1997. He qualified as a doctor and currently heads a
medical technology company.


"I have had a long association with cricket and hope to build on
the hard work which has taken cricket in New Zealand from a
largely amateur structure in the early 1990s to the professional
sport that it is today," Vaughan said.
