A Chinese rights activist and veteran of the 1989 Tiananmen pro-
democracy movement who was jailed for his political views has
been granted permission by China to visit Hong Kong, a report
said Tuesday.


Ren Wanding will spend a week in the southern territory where he
will meet local supporters and also have a medical examination,
the South China Morning Post said.


According to Amnesty International, Ren, 63, was jailed for a
total of 11 years for his role in drafting a Chinese declaration
of human rights in 1979, for setting up the China Human Rights
Alliance and for joining the 1989 Tiananmen movement that ended
in the bloody June 4 military crackdown.


Ren told the Post he believed the authorities had approved his
visit in a spirit of openness ahead of next year's Beijing
Olympics.


"They have allowed foreign journalists to interview freely all
kinds of people, including people of our kind," he was quoted as
saying.


The Post said Ren lived under surveillance in Beijing and had
been under house arrest between August and December for
unspecified reasons.


He said he would meet leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy
movement, including Martin Lee, Szeto Wah and Democratic Party
chairman Albert Ho.
