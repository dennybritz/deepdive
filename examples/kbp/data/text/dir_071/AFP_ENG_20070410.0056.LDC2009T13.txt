A US military helicopter came under small arms fire in Baghdad on
Tuesday but returned safely to its base, a military spokeswoman
told AFP.


"We had an incident. A helicopter took small arms fire but
returned safely to the base," Lieutenant Colonel Josslyn Aberle
said.


"It did not go down. The pilot had control all the time. It
happened somewhere in Baghdad. We are still gathering details."


Since January 20, at least 10 US helicopters -- including two
operated by private security firms -- have come down in Iraq,
most of them to hostile fire.
