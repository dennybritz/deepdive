North Korea Thursday abruptly cancelled planned visits by dozens
of Seoul-based journalists who had been invited to cover a major
festival.


Kim Chayon, an official at the North Korean consulate in the
Chinese city of Shenyang, said by email she had been told that
the foreign ministry in Pyongyang would not authorise visas for
the April 14-18 tour.


No reason was immediately given but the isolated communist state
has a long history of authorising media trips and then denying
visas at the last minute.


Saturday, April 14, is the deadline for the North to shut down
its Yongbyon reactor under a February 13 six-nation agreement on
scrapping its nuclear programme. Envoys to the talks say the
deadline may be missed due to a continuing row over the return of
North Korean funds frozen in Macau.


Sunday, April 15, is designated the "Day of the Sun" -- the 95th
anniversary of the birth of founding father Kim Il-Sung, who died
in 1994.


Pyongyang had originally invited journalists to cover a mass
gymnastics event staged as part of the Arirang festival from
April 15 to May 20.


The festival was held in 2002 and 2005 but was cancelled last
year due to floods.
