Iran will not accept any suspension of its sensitive nuclear
activities, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Tuesday,
urging world powers to accept the "new reality" of its industrial
uranium enrichment.


"The suspension of enrichment is not acceptable either as a
precondition to negotations or as a result of such talks," said
Mottaki.


"We are ready for dialogue (with world powers) if they have
something new to say," he told reporters.


"The other party must accept the new reality" of Iran's nuclear
programme, he added, referring to Tehran's announcement on Monday
that it could now enrich uranium on an industrial scale.


Enrichment of uranium is the key sticking point in the standoff
between Iran and the West as the process can produce nuclear fuel
but in highly extended form can also make the fissile core for an
atomic bomb.
