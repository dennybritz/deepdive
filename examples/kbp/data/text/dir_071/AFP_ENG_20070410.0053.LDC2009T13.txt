Japanese camera maker Pentax Corp. said Tuesday that it has
scrapped a plan to merge with optical glass manufacturer Hoya
Corp. while its president resigned amid an apparent boardroom
rift over the deal.


Pentax will shelve the planned merger for now because of the
situation within the company and the views of shareholders, but
will keep studying the possibility of a tie-up with Hoya, Pentax
said in a statement.


Pentax also said its president Fumio Urano, 63, had stepped down
and board member Takashi Watanuki, 54, will replace him.


Urano took the initiative to push for the merger with Hoya, but
some directors at Pentax are reportedly unhappy with the merger
plan.


Japan's camera industry has been transforming itself in the face
of falling prices and stiff competition, with leading makers
giving up on traditional film cameras in favor of digital models.


The two companies agreed last December to merge their operations
through a share swap, but Hoya said last week that it may offer
to buy Pentax shares instead through a tender offer.


A spokeswoman for Hoya said the optical glass maker had decided
to continue negotiations with Pentax over a possible merger
including through a tender offer.


Hoya has reportedly proposed a new merger plan under which it
will raise its proposed offer for Pentax by about 20 percent to
770 yen per share to secure the support of shareholders.


The two companies, which are both manufacturers of medical
equipment, had said in December they planned to sign a contract
in April and integrate into Hoya Pentax HD Corp as of October 1.
