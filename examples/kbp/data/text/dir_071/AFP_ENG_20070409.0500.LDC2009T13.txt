China Petroleum Chemical Corp (Sinopec), the nation's largest
refiner, said Tuesday its 2006 net profit rose 30.1 percent to
53.9 billion yuan (7 billion dollars) under international
accounting standards.


Sinopec's strong performance was boosted by a one-off subsidy of
5.0 billion yuan from the central government last year along with
higher crude oil and gas prices, the company said in a statement
posted on its website.


In order to insulate consumers from high crude oil prices, the
Chinese government sets the price of refined oil products below
market value and then provides a subsidy to refiners, which
partially covers the difference.


In its annual report, Sinopec said revenue in 2006 grew 29.3
percent to 1.1 trillion yuan.


Crude oil output in 2006 was 285.2 million barrels, up 2.3
percent, while natural gas output increased 15.6 percent to 7.7
billion cubic metres (256.5 billion cubic feet).
