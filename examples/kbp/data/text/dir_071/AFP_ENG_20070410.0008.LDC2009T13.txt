Malaysian authorities seized methamphetamines with a street value
of more than 12.0 million ringgit (3.5 million dollars) in a
major drug bust, a report said Tuesday.


Police raided a house in Klang district in western Selangor state
late Sunday and discovered several men processing liquid "syabu"
or methamphetamine.


They seized 123 kilograms (271 pounds) of liquid "syabu" which
could produce 67 kilograms of the drug in crystal form, police
said.


"This is by far the largest-ever syabu processing laboratory that
we have busted so far," Federal Narcotics Crime Investigations
director Abang Abdul Wahap Abang Julai was quoted as saying by
The Star daily.


Barely 24 hours before, police had conducted simultaneous raids
in three states and discovered two laboratories in a palm oil
plantation in southern Johor state where they found 12 kilograms
of "syabu" worth 2.0 million ringgit.


"We believe that this racket has dealings with the one raided in
Johor and is linked to various international drug syndicates
based on the recovery of the cash in various currencies," Abang
Abdul Wahap said.


Police seized 5.8 million ringgit in cash in various currencies
from the house in Klang.


"The syndicate carried out its activities in remote areas such as
plantations and new housing estates that were not fully
occupied," Abang Abdul Wahap said.


A total of 32 people, including nine Indonesians, were arrested
after two days of raids.
