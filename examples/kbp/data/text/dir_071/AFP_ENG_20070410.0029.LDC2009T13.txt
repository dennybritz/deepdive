Five people including two boys were shot dead by suspected
Islamic rebels in separate shootings in Thailand's restive
Muslim-majority south, police said Tuesday.


A 53-year-old Buddhist man was gunned down in a drive-by shooting
Tuesday in Yala, one of three insurgency-torn southern provinces
bordering Malaysia.


Four Muslims, including two boys aged 12 and 14, were shot dead
in Yala late Monday as they were returning from a funeral for
another victim of the unrest, police said. The other two victims
were men in their 20s.


The ambush also wounded seven as they were on a pick-up truck
returning from the funeral for a 55-year-old man whose body was
ripped in half when a bomb exploded under his truck earlier.


Including the latest shootings, a total of 10 people have been
killed in attacks around Yala since Monday.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in Thailand's violence-
torn south since an insurgency broke out in January 2004.


Thailand's military-installed government has launched a raft of
peace measures, only to see the attacks escalate in the past six
months.


The attacks have also become more gruesome, including two
beheadings last month.
