The United Nations on Tuesday began storing weapons from Nepal's
army, a key part of a peace deal that ended a decade-long armed
conflict in the Himalayan nation, officials said.


"The UN arms monitoring team began registering weapons of Nepal
Army from Tuesday noon," Kieran Dwyer, spokesman of the United
Nations Mission in Nepal, told AFP.


"We expect to complete the arms storage process in the next 3-4
days."


The weapons are being locked up in an army camp on the outskirts
of Kathmandu.


"We have begun storing equal numbers of arms to those of the
Maoist army under the monitoring conditions," said army spokesman
Ramindra Chhetri.


The weapons will be sealed in 14 UN containers at a barracks in
Chhauni and the army will keep the key, said Chhetri.


The UN was invited by Nepal's government and Maoists to register
and monitor the former rebels' weapons and army.


It has registered just over 31,000 Maoist soldiers and 3,430 of
their weapons at seven different sites across the country.


A second phase of UN monitoring, which includes verification of
Maoist arms and fighters, is slated to begin only after the
completion of the registration of Nepal Army weapons.


The Maoists entered government earlier this month after waging a
decade-long bloody "people's war" that killed at least 13,000
people.
