Nearly half the prisoners in jail in Indonesia's staunchly Muslim
province of Aceh have escaped after a mass breakout involving
more than 100 convicts, a warden said Tuesday.


Some 108 inmates out of 238 in the state jail escaped on Sunday
after a gang of 15 took one prison guard hostage at knifepoint,
the warden Jalil said.


"Only 12 of the prisoners have been captured again, while another
voluntarily surrendered himself," said Jalil.


The gang unlocked other cells in the state jail in Jantho and
forced the guards to open the main gates, triggering the
breakout, although 120 inmates decided not to flee, Jalil said.


Most of the prisoners had been jailed on drug offences.
