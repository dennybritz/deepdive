Iran is still seeking to install 50,000 uranium enriching
centrifuges at its nuclear plant in Natanz, the head of the
Iranian atomic energy organisation said on Tuesday, the IRNA
agency reported.


"The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is not just the
installation of 3,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant but we are
doing everything to install 50,000 centrifuges," Gholam Reza
Aghazadeh said.


Iran said on Monday it could now enrich uranium on an industrial
scale but did not disclose how many centrifuges it had now
installed at the Natanz plant in central Iran to enrich uranium.
