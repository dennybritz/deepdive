Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov on Monday dismissed
his interior minister Akmammed Rakhmanov for "incompetence",
state television reported.


Berdymukhammedov accused Rakhmanov of making serious mistakes and
lacking firmness towards his staff.


"I have a whole file with evidence against you. I could dishonour
you like a dog, but I won't do it in public," Berdymukhammedov
told Rakhmanov in the presence of his cabinet colleagues and the
president of parliament.


Berdymukhammedov took power in February after the death in
December of the country's first post-Soviet leader, the dictator
and president-for-life Saparmurat Niyazov.


Rakhmanov had already served under Niyazov.
