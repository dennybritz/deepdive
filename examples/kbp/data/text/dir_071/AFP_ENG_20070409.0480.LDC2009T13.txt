Hong Kong share prices opened sharply higher Tuesday, gaining
1.02 percent, as the market tried to catch up with gains in
overseas bourses following a five-day break, dealers said.


The strong performance in China and elsewhere in the last few
days prompted local investors to pick up blue chips and H-shares
after the long holiday.


The market was shut from Thursday until Monday for the Ching Ming
Festival and Easter holidays.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index opened up 206.83 points at
20,416.54.
