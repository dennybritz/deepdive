The World Bank is sending a team to the tsunami-battered Solomon
Islands to assess the damage to infrastructure in the
impoverished nation with a view to rebuilding, it said Tuesday.


A three-strong team will arrive in the South Pacific island
nation later this week after Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare
accepted an offer for the bank to help with recovery and
rebuilding.


"The Solomon Islands government has now asked the Bank to assist
with a detailed assessment of reconstruction and rehabilitation
needs," it said in a statement issued in Sydney.


One of the three World Bank experts heading to the Solomons is an
infrastructure specialist who worked alongside the Indonesian
government in assessing the damage wrought in Banda Aceh by a
major tsunami in 2004.


The Boxing Day tsunami killed more than 220,000 people around the
Indian Ocean.


At least 39 people have been confirmed killed in the April 2
undersea earthquake packing a magnitude of 8.0 and the tsunami
that it unleashed on the western Solomon Islands.


Nearly 5,500 other people were left homeless by the double
disaster that hit one of the remotest regions of the archipelago.
