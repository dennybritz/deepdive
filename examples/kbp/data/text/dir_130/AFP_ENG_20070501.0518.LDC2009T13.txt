The dollar received a boost from unexpectedly robust US
manufacturing data on Tuesday that eased concerns about soft
conditions in the world's biggest economy.


The euro was changing hands at 1.3606 dollars at 2100 GMT, from
1.3649 dollars in New York late on Monday.


The dollar fetched 119.78 yen, compared with 119.41 on Monday.


In the United States all eyes had been on US industrial activity
data, with the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) index coming
ahead of key US jobs data on Friday.


The index jumped much more than expected to 54.7 from 50.9 in
March. The index had been expected to edge up slightly to just
51.0.


Analysts said the data made it more likely that the US Federal
Reserve would maintain interest rates at current levels when it
meets on May 9, and not be induced to cut rates.


"After four quarters of soft growth, worries about the economy
slipping into a recession have grown. This report should ease
those concerns a little bit," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic
Advisors.


"This is the best number that we have seen in 11 months which
suggests the manufacturing sector may really be bottoming out,"
added Kathy Lien at Forex Capital Markets. "All of the numbers
released today continue to support the Federal Reserve's need to
keep interest rates steady."


The euro had hovered near its record high against the dollar on
Monday after a US government report revealed a benign inflation
reading, raising the odds of a rate cut, analysts said.


In late New York trade, the dollar stood at 1.2143 Swiss francs
after 1.2067 Monday.


The pound was being traded at 1.9985 dollars from 1.9994.
