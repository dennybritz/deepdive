Two former world champions Ronnie 'Rocket' O'Sullivan and John
Higgins were locked in an enthralling encounter at bthe snooker
world championships here on Tuesday with their quarter-final tied
at 4-4 after the first session.


The winner of the best of 25 frames clash could well be the only
former world champion left standing as Englishman Shaun Murphy
was trailing 11-5 to Welshman Matthew Stevens - who was beaten in
the 2005 final by Murphy - going into Wednesday's final session.


Elsewhere English qualifier Mark Selby's dream tournament was
continuing as he led Ali Carter - victor over seven-time champion
Steven Hendry in the second round - 5-3.


Higgins' fellow Scotsman Stephen Maguire will go into the final
session on Wednesday with his nose just in front of Englishman
Anthony Hamilton as he holds a 9-7 lead.


Higgins looked more like the player that should be nicknamed
'Rocket' as he blazed into a 3-1 lead but two-time champion
O'Sullivan stormed back to make it 3-3 with two breaks of over
50.


Higgins, the 1998 champion, hit back with his 350th career
century break when he made a 110 clearance in the seventh frame
but again he was pinned back by O'Sullivan, who made a break of
76 to leave the match beautifully poised.


Murphy was also tied at 4-4 going into the second session with
Stevens but was never at the races as Stevens won seven of the
eight frames, leaving his best break to the 16th and final frame
when he had one of 81.


All the matches will come to a conclusion on Wednesday.
