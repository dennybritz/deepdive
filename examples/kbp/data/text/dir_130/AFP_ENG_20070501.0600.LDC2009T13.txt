A candidate in the May 14 mid-term elections has been killed in
the central Philippine province of Cebu, police said Wednesday.


Rogelio Illustrisimo died from his wounds after two gunmen shot
him at close range before escaping, officers said.


Police said they are investigating the motive for the Wednesday
morning attack, but said it apparently was connected to local
politics.


A man is being held for questioning, but it was not clear whether
he was one of the suspects, officers said.


The victim was a candidate for mayor in the town of Santa Fe in
Cebu's Bantayan island and there has been heated rivalry for the
post.


President Gloria Arroyo last week ordered the armed forces to
help police dismantle "private armies" employed by local
politicians amid a spate of vendetta killings ahead of the May 14
mid-term vote.


Illustrisimo is the 26th victim of hired guns this election
season, although that is still below the toll for the 2004
presidential elections -- when 148 deaths were recorded -- and
the 2001 mid-term polls with 111 killings.


On Monday, the mayor of the northern city of San Carlos, Julian
Resuello, died at a Manila hospital where he was being treated
after being ambushed at the weekend.


Last week, a town council candidate and a policeman were also
killed in an ambush by suspected political rivals in the town of
Jaen in northern Nueva Ecija province.


Seventeen others were wounded, including three policemen, leading
the election commission to place the province under its security
watch to prevent further bloodshed.
