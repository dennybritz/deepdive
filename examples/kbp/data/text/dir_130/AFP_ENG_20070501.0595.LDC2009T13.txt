Fourteen miners were killed in an explosion at an illegally
operating mine in northern China, the government said Wednesday,
the latest accident in the nation's dangerous mining industry.


The blast occurred early Monday morning at an illegal mine in
Liujiacun village, Shanxi province, the State Administration for
Work Safety said on its website.


Four miners were rescued following the blast, which is currently
under investigation, it said.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world. More than 4,700 workers were killed last year, according
to official figures, but independent labour groups put the death
toll at up to 20,000 annually.
