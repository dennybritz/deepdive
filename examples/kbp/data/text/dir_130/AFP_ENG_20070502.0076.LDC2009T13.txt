Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party submitted a formal
proposal to parliament Wednesday for early general elections to
be held on June 24, the Anatolia news agency reported.


The proposal, which is like a draft law, must be approved in
parliament for elections to be held on that date. It was not
immediately known when it would be debated.


Elections are currently scheduled for November 4.


Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced overnight that his
party is ready for early elections on June 24 or July 1 after the
Constitutional Court annuled the first-round of a turbulent
presidential vote.


The crisis erupted over widespread opposition to the presidency
of the sole candidate, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, because of
his Islamist background.
