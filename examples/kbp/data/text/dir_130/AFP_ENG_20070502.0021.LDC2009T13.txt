The Thai junta leader Wednesday mocked the naming of ousted
premier Thaksin Shinawatra as head of the Professional Golf
Association of Thailand.


"It's ridiculous. I think Thais are in a confused condition. Some
may not be able to separate what is good from what is bad.
Perhaps we should ask a psychiatrist to help them," General
Sonthi Boonyaratglin said in the Nation newspaper.


The PGAT on Tuesday unveiled Thaksin as its new president,
despite the fact that the fallen premier has been living in exile
since his government was toppled in September.


But other Thaksin critics warned against underestimating golf's
political clout, and said Thaksin's move to the head of the PGAT
could mark an effort to return to the political limelight.


"Politicians and golf courses can't be divided. When Thaksin was
PM, he made decisions about many projects on the golf course,"
said Suriyasai Katasila, who helped lead street protests against
Thaksin last year.


"Either golf or football was linked to a network of politically
influential groups," he said in the Nation.


The ousted premier reportedly has also made a surprise bid worth
108 million pounds (215 million dollar) to buy English Premier
League football club Manchester City, following a failed bid for
Liverpool three years ago.


Thaksin was picked for the PGAT job despite living in exile since
he was toppled. He is currently in Beijing, where he opened a
Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course last week.
