Chinese Internet company Alibaba.com Corp is planning an initial
public offering in New York or Hong Kong this year for one of its
business units, a Chinese financial website said Wednesday.


Alibaba, which is part-owned by Yahoo! Inc, plans to list its
core business-to- business operation that helps match suppliers
in China and elsewhere with purchasers over the Internet, the
China Financial Online website said.


The company, which hopes to list this year, is seeking up to 7.8
billion yuan (one billion dollars) in the listing, it said. The
other units of the company would not be a part of the offering,
it added.


The website cited a Wall Street Journal report earlier this week
that said Alibaba last month selected Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley to be lead underwriters for the offering.


Officials at the company were unavailable for comment on
Wednesday due to China's week-long May Day holiday.


Earlier this year, Alibaba's chairman Jack Ma said the company
was ready to list, but he gave no timetable.


"We are very ready (for an IPO) compared with other dotcom
companies," Ma said, "however, there is no schedule yet ... we
should find the right time."


He noted the firm's current focus is to build up a strong team,
and make its companies more profitable.


In August 2005, Yahoo invested one billion dollars for a 40
percent stake in Alibaba, which also agreed to run the Chinese
operations of the US Internet giant.
