Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) said Wednesday it
expected to see a slight improvement in its profitability in the
second quarter, with a stronger pickup in the third on an
increase in shipments.


The world's second largest contract chipmaker said wafer
shipments are expected to increase 6.0-8.0 percent sequentially,
while the average selling price (ASP) in US dollar terms may
remain flat,


The company said it expects its capacity utilization rate to
increase to about 75 percent in the current quarter from 74
percent in the first three months of the year.


"There will be considerable earnings growth in the third
quarter," said UMC chairman and chief executive officer Jackson
Hu.


"Our clients will continue to bring down their inventory levels
in the second quarter," he told an investor conference.


UMC said it is leaving its previously announced capital
expenditure for 2007 unchanged at 1.0-1.2 billion US dollars.


The company announced on Monday its net profit for the quarter to
March fell 88 percent from a year earlier to 1.46 billion dollars
(43.84 million US).


Sales in the quarter stood at 23.03 billion dollars, compared
with 24.38 billion dollars a year earlier.
