Former Socceroo Aurelio Vidmar was on Wednesday appointed coach
of A-League club Adelaide United on a full-time basis, beating 40
other applicants for the job.


Vidmar, aged 40, has been interim coach since John Kosmina
resigned at the end of last season and steered the side through
the opening games of their inaugural AFC Champions League
campaign.


"Looking towards the future of the A-League, Aurelio has got all
of the characteristics and qualities that we want and believe is
required to be successful as a modern day coach," chief executive
Sam Ciccarello said in a statement.


Vidmar said he was thrilled to get the job.


"It's a privilege and a great honour to be coaching this great
club and I look forward to sinking my teeth into the work that is
ahead of us," he said.
