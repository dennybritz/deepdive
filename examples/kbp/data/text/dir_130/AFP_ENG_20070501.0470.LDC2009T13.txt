A US soldier attached to the operational command of the force in
Iraq died of "non-battle causes" Tuesday, according to a
statement from the military.


The death brought the number of US personnel to die or have been
killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion to 3,352, according to an
AFP tally based on Pentagon figures.
