A group of four North Korean defectors has crossed the tense
maritime border in a small wooden boat to reach South Korea,
intelligence sources said Wednesday.


The four were spotted Saturday near the South's frontline
Yeonpyong island in the Yellow Sea and are now being questioned.


The National Intelligence Service refused to comment on news
reports of the incident but intelligence sources confirmed the
defection to AFP.


"We cannot comment on the details for the safety of their
families left behind in the North," one source said.


Chosun Ilbo newspaper said they were found on the tiny boat with
two diving suits, snorkel masks and a 100-metre (330-foot) long
oxygen hose. It gave no explanation for the equipment.


A group of five North Koreans, four of them from one family,
defected in March 2006 to South Korea after crossing the sea
border in the East Sea.


Chosun, quoting a government source, said relatives of the five
left behind in the North had been purged after news reports of
their defection.


Thousands of North Koreans have tried to flee poverty and
repression to the wealthier South. But defections across the
heavily-guarded inter-Korean border are rare, with people usually
opting to flee via China.


More than 10,000 people have arrived in the South since the
1950-1953 war ended.


Human rights groups say hundreds of thousands more may be hiding
out in China, with many awaiting an opportunity to travel to
Seoul via a third country.


Beijing repatriates those whom it catches as economic migrants.
