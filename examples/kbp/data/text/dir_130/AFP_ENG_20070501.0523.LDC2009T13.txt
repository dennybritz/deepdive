Five-time champions Liverpool reached the Champions League final
here on Tuesday after beating Chelsea 4-1 on penalties after the
tie ended 1-1 on aggregate.


Liverpool had levelled the clash through Daniel Agger in the 22nd
minute - Chelsea won the first leg 1-0 - while the hosts had a
goal by Dirk Kuyt ruled out in the first-half of extra-time for
offside.


Kuyt, though, had the last laugh as he rifled home the decisive
penalty after Pepe Reina had saved two of Chelsea's penalties by
Arjen Robben and Geremi.


For inspirational captain Steven Gerrard it was a nice way to
respond to Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's remarks that Liverpool
were a 'little' side.


"Jose Mourinho has been a credit to English football," said
Gerrard.


"However he makes us laugh some times.


"It was a bit disrespectful to call us a little club, yeah a
little club that has reached two European Cup finals in three
years."


Kuyt, who had said on Sunday that they regarded Mourinho as a
laughing stock in the Liverpool dressing room because of his
increasingly laughable comments, said it was almost like a dream.


"It is very special for me, my first final in my first year at
Liverpool," said the Dutch international striker.


"We believed in it. Pepe was marvellous."


Reina, who had also been the hero in Liverpool's shootout victory
over West Ham in last season's FA Cup final saving three of the
four penalties, was typically modest.


"It was an important win. We've reached the last step and now we
must climb it," he said.


Liverpool will meet either AC Milan or Manchester United in the
final on May 23 in Athens.
