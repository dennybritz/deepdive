US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday said she was
prepared to discuss "any question" if she holds talks with her
Iranian counterpart at this week's Iraq conference in Egypt.


"I think I could handle any question as asked," Rice told
reporters travelling with her to the conference in the Egyptian
Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.


She indicated she would be prepared to discuss subjects other
than Iraq at the conference with Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki, including the standoff over Iran's nuclear
programme.


"Our position on the nuclear issue is well known and I think that
the Iranians know it as well," said Rice.


"But obviously if we encounter each other and we wander on other
subjects, I am prepared to at least address them, in terms of the
American policy," said Rice, indicating she would go no further
than restating the US position.


The United States accuses Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, a
charge vehemently denied by Tehran, and wants the Islamic
republic to immediately freeze uranium enrichment operations.


Washington has repeatedly said it is ready for Rice to hold talks
with Mottaki at the conference, in what would be the highest-
level official contact between the two foes since the United
States cut relations in 1980.


However, Tehran has yet to give an unequivocal sign it is ready
for talks and Deputy Foreign Minister Mehdi Mostavafi said on
Tuesday the conditions were not right for a "dialogue" with Rice
at the conference.
