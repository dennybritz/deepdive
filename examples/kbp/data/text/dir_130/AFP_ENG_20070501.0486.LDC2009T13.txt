Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that he
would ask for early legislative elections after the country's top
court annulled a parliamentary vote to elect the next president.


"We will apply to parliment at once, tommorrow (Wednesday)
morning, to bring general elections forward," Erdogan told a news
conference after a meeting of his Justice and Development Party's
(AKP) leadership.


"For us, the election date could be June 24 or July 1 because
those are the earliest possible dates to hold elections," he
added.


Legislative elections are currently set for November 4.
