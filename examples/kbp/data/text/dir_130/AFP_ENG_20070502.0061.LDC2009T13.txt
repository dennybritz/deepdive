Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is expected to ask
beleaguered Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to resign during a meeting
later on Wednesday, a senior official in her office told AFP.


Livni, a member of Olmert's Kadima party widely tipped to take
over party leadership should he quit, is due to meet with Olmert
at 1300 GMT, the official said on condition of anonymity.


"She is expected to ask him to resign," he said.


Should she issue the call, Livni would become the most senior
member in Olmert's ruling coalition and within his party to join
the chorus clamouring for the premier's scalp in the wake of a
damning report of his handling of last year's Lebanon war.


Monday's partial report by a government commission accused Olmert
of "serious failure in exercising judgement, responsibility and
prudence," of acting "hastily" and personally contributing to
"over-ambitious" and unfeasible war aims.


Speaking late on Monday, Olmert told the nation it would be
"incorrect" for him to resign. He vowed that his government,
already reeling from a string of sex and corruption scandals,
would now focus quickly to correct the faults.
