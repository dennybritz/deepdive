The dollar firmed against the euro and the yen in Asian trade on
Wednesday, shored up by better-than-expected US manufacturing
data, dealers said.


Trading in Asia was relatively quiet as traders took to the
sidelines ahead of a four-day holiday weekend in Tokyo, they
added.


The dollar edged up to 119.87 yen in Tokyo morning trade from
119.78 in New York late Tuesday.


The euro eased to 1.3595 dollars after 1.3606 and to 162.95 yen
from 162.99.


"Traders seem to be adjusting their positions after massive
purchases of euros in the past few days, a move which is
certainly prompted by the brisk US manufacturing data," said
Marito Ueda, a currency trader at FX Prime.


The Institute of Supply Management's index of US industrial
activity rose to 54.7 from 50.9 in March, beating market
expectations for a slight gain to 51.0.


Analysts said the data made it more likely that the US Federal
Reserve would maintain interest rates at current levels when it
meets on May 9, and not be spurred to cut them.


The euro has edged down from its all time high of 1.3682 against
the dollar struck on Friday, while the greenback is also on an
upswing against the yen, dealers said.


"The dollar may briefly reach above 120 yen level as there's no
reason to buy the yen for the moment," added Ueda.


"Traders are seeking new market-moving factors, namely US
payrolls data due out Friday," said Ueda.
