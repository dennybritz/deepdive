St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Josh Hancock was involved in a
traffic accident less than three days before the one that took
his life on Sunday, American media reported said Tuesday.


Hancock was killed in an early-morning accident on Sunday. He was
29.


Hancock walked away uninjured from a crash on Thursday, but was
late for the team's afternoon game a few hours later. Club
officials claimed Hancock had overslept. However, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch newspaper reported that Hancock was hung over.


Then after pitching in the Cardinals' Saturday afternoon game
against the Chicago Cubs, Hancock spent the night at Mike
Shannon's Steaks and Seafood Restaurant.


A couple at the restaurant informed the Post-Dispatch that
Hancock appeared to be drinking to a point of impairment.


A few hours after being at the restaurant, Hancock was in the
deadly crash.


Police said Hancock was driving a 2007 Ford Explorer when he
struck the back end of a tow truck just after midnight local
time.


The truck was in the far left lane with its hazard lights on
helping another vehicle that was involved in an earlier accident.


According to police, Hancock did not attempt to avoid the
collision until the last second and appeared to be killed
immediately.


The police also stated that speed was not a factor and no alcohol
was found in the vehicle.


Autopsy results are still pending.
