An Argentine military pilot died Tuesday when his fighter plane
crashed during a demonstration flight, steering his aircraft to
avoid hitting a populated area, military sources said.


"The aircraft crashed to the ground. The airman, who was a
fighter pilot, died," an air force spokesman said. The causes of
the crash of the Mirage 3 fighter plane were not known and an
investigation was underway.


"The pilot steered the plane towards an unpopulated area,
avoiding a higher toll through this heroic act," the air force
said in a statement.


The plane was overflying an air force base in the town of Tandil,
375 kilometers (233 miles) south of the capital Buenos Aires.


The jet was part of a display to mark the 25th anniversary of the
Argentine air force's first combat flights, which took place May
1, 1982 during Argentina's war with Britain over the Falkand
Islands.
