Hong Kong share prices finished the morning session 0.43 percent
higher Wednesday following a strong performance on Wall Street
overnight and gains in index heavyweight HSBC, dealers said.


HSBC found solid support from news that a unit of Dubai
International Capital has made a substantial investment in the
global banking giant.


The benchmark Hang Seng index ended the morning up 86.36 points
at 20,405.34.
