General Motors posted a 2.2 percent drop in its April sales
Tuesday to 311,687 vehicles as planned reductions in fleet sales
to rental companies offset a 3.6 percent increase in sales at
dealerships.


"April sales were consistent with the pattern of the last few
quarters - retail sales up, daily rental down, and continued
strength of our launch vehicles," said Mark LaNeve, vice
president, GM North American sales, service and marketing.


"As we continue to execute our North American marketing plans,
we've seen positive results, including increased residual values
for our products."


Car sales fell 2.6 percent to 121,009 vehicles in April while
truck sales fell 2.0 percent to 190,678 units.


Year-to-date vehicle sales were down 6.7 percent at 1,220,781
following an 8.7 percent drop in car sales and a 5.4 percent drop
in truck sales.


GM also reduced its forecast for second quarter production in
North America by 1.3 percent to 1.145 million vehicles (403,000
cars and 742,000 trucks). Production forecasts were unchanged in
Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, Africa and the Middle
East.
