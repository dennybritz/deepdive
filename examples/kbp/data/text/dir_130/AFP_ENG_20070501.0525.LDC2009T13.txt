Former Super Bowl winning wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was
released by the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League
on Tuesday.


In his only season with Carolina, Johnson caught 70 passes for
815 yards and four touchdowns.


Johnson, who turns 35 in July, is known for his ability to catch
passes over the middle. He caught 71 passes for 839 yards and six
touchdowns with the Dallas Cowboys in 2005, but was released
after the season to make room for Terrell Owens.


Carolina then signed Johnson in March 2006 to a four-year
contract worth 19 million dollars.


Johnson has played for four teams in 11 seasons and is tied for
15th in league history with 814 catches for 10,571 yards and 64
touchdowns.


The No. 1 overall pick in the 1996 draft, Johnson spent his first
four years with the New York Jets, compiling 305 catches and
making the Pro Bowl twice.


In 2000, Johnson was traded to Tampa Bay where he helped the
Buccaneers win a Super Bowl in 2002.
