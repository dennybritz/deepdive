President George W. Bush Tuesday vetoed a bill setting an Iraq
withdrawal timeline, defying his Democratic foes exactly four
years after he declared major combat over in the war-torn
country.


"Members of the House and Senate passed a bill that substitues
the opinions of politicians for the judgment of our military
commanders, so a few minutes ago, I vetoed the bill," Bush said.


"Setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure,
and that would be irresponsible," he said as protesters outside
the White House chanted "stop the war now" and "how many more
will die?" through a bullhorn.
