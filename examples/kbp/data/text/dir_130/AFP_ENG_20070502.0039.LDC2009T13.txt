Japanese share prices closed up 0.69 percent Wednesday after Wall
Street notched up another record finish and the dollar hit a two-
month high against the yen, dealers said.


They said, however, that trading was relatively quiet ahead of a
four-day holiday weekend in Tokyo.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
gained 119.94 points at 17,394.92.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares added 10.97
points or 0.65 percent to 1,704.22.
