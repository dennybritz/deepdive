The New York Yankees won just their second game in their last 10
tries with a 10-1 victory over the Texas Rangers, but suffered
another key loss to the pitching staff.


Philip Hughes (1-1), the Yankees' top prospect, was pitching
masterfully Tuesday and carried a no-hitter through 6 1/3 innings
before he went down with a left hamstring injuring, thus becoming
the latest New York pitcher to head to the sidelines.


"It's significant," New York manager Joe Torre said. "He felt a
little pop and while he seems to be feeling pretty good, my guess
is that we're thinking in terms of four-to-six weeks."


The Yankees already have Mike Mussina (hamstring), Carl Pavano
(forearm) and Jeff Karstens (leg) on the disabled list.


If Hughes joins them this will be a night more remembered for his
injury than the near no-hitter and win.


"There is a bit of, 'Why me?' in all this especially with a
youngster like Hughes when everything seems to going fine. It's
just another freak thing," Torre said.


Hughes (1-0), who earned his first major league win, had yielded
just three walks until he suffered the injury after an 0-2 pitch
to Mark Teixeira.


Torre and the team trainers rushed out to the mound after Hughes
walked off to the side grabbing behind his left leg.


"It's definitely frustrating because it puts a bit of a damper on
my first major league win," Hughes said.


Hughes was well aware of what he was on the verge of
accomplishing.


"I knew the whole game that I had a no-hitter working," said
Hughes, who was helped by three double plays. "I knew that I
hadn't given up a hit, but I was always just concentrating on the
next hitter and never thinking about the last out in the ninth."
