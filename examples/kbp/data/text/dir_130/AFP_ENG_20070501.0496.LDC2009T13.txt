The Ugandan military on Tuesday said Lord's Resistance Army
rebels had killed seven civilians, jeopardising a truce with the
Ugandan government.


"They undressed the seven, tied their hands on their backs and
used clubs to smash them on the heads and kill them," Lieutenant
Chris Magezi, who is based in northern Uganda, told AFP.


The LRA rebels could not immediately be reached to comment on the
attack that happened on northern Uganda on Monday.


The rebels signed a truce with the government in August last year
and renewed it on April 14 after the intervention of the UN
special envoy to the talks, Mozambique's former president Joaquim
Chissano.


"This is a blatant violation of a (truce) agreement we recently
signed and an indication of the lack of seriousness on the part
of the rebels to pursue a peace deal with the government," Magezi
added.


LRA supremo Joseph Kony and his deputy Vincent Otti -- among five
LRA commanders indicted by the International Criminal Court for
war crimes -- have refused to participate in the talks and have
instead delegated the responsibility to junior officials.


Kony has vowed never to sign a peace deal unless the ICC
indictments are withdrawn.


The LRA took over a two-year-old rebellion in northern Uganda in
1988 and vowed to overthrow President Yoweri Museveni. Its
campaign has been marked by brutality against civilians.


The fighting has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced
up to one million people.
