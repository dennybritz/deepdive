The United States on Tuesday said leftist Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez was "digging a hole for the Venezuelan people" by
withdrawing his country from key world financial institutions.


Chavez, one of Washington's fiercest critics, announced late
Monday that he was taking steps to quit the Washington-based
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which he called
"tools of US imperialism".


"You can't take the shovel out of the man's hand, he just keeps
digging," US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said of
Chavez when asked to comment on his actions.


"I think he's digging a hole for the Venezuelan people,"
McCormack said.


"It's sadly the case that it is not just the Venezuelan elites
around President Chavez who suffer as a result of these
decisions, it's really the Venezuelan people who suffer," he
said.


Chavez, who has made a habit of demonizing the Bush
administration, claimed the IMF and the World Bank were dominated
since their conception by the United States and Europe.


Both financial institutions have come under renewed scrutiny in
South America.


Long subjected to the IMF's austerity policies, Brazil, Argentina
and Uruguay have now reimbursed ahead of time a large part of
their debt, thanks to renewed economic growth.


The US administration accuses Chavez of being a destabilizing
force in Latin America, and US Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice claimed last week that he was wrecking Venezuela
"economically and politically".
