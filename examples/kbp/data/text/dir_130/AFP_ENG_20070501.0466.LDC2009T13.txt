US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed Tuesday a
bill tying funding to the war in Iraq to a timeline for
withdrawal, despite President George W. Bush's pledge to veto it.


"I urge the president to sign the war on terror supplemental,"
Pelosi said as she signed the bill after it was passed by both
chambers of Congress.
