Former Leeds star Mark Viduka says he is devastated by the fate
that has befallen the former English football giants, but said
they had the potential to bounce back.


The three-time English champions and 1975 European Cup finalists
are almost certain to be relegated to the third tier of English
football for the first time in their history next weekend.


They must beat Derby by a hatful of goals and hope Hull City lose
at home to Plymouth if they are to stay up.


Middlesbrough's Viduka made 130 appearances for Leeds and scored
59 goals when he first arrived in English football from Celtic in
2000 before departing in 2004 after a falling-out with the club
hierarchy.


"I still live in Yorkshire and know just how much the club means
to the people in that area," the Socceroo was quoted as saying by
Australian Associated Press.


"And it still means a lot to me as a former player, as it was a
great club to be a part of and it's a really big shame the way
things have gone.


"Leeds still have the potential to bounce back because of their
support base and the reputation of the club, which is still
massive.


"I definitely still regard Leeds as a great club and that it will
always be."


Speculation is gathering pace regarding the future of the club
with some reports in England claiming the former Premiership side
could go into administration or be taken over.
