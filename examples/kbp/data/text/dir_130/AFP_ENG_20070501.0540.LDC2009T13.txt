A Chinese student in Moscow was beaten by unknown assailants, the
Interfax news agency reported late Tuesday quoting a police
source.


The victim, identified as Liu Yan, student of Moscow's highway
and road institute, was hospitalised with head injuries after he
was attacked near his house.


It was not immediately clear if the attack was due to racist
motives.


According to analysts, people originating from former Soviet
republics like Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Georgia, along
with Asians and Africans, were the most likely to fall victim to
racist attacks.
