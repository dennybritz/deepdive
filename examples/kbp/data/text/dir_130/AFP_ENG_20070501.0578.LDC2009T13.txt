All Black winger Sitiveni Sivivatu has been found guilty of
serious misconduct by the New Zealand Rugby Union over an assault
on his wife.


Sivivatu was discharged without conviction by a New Zealand court
over the assault last month after pleading guilty, with the judge
saying the publicity surrounding the case was sufficient penalty.


But he also faced a NZRU hearing for being in breach of his
contract.


The 25-year-old Fijian-born player received a formal warning and
agreed to counselling, the NZRU said in a statement Wednesday.


"Siti has faced the courts, and as a result of that verdict was
subject to intense public scrutiny," NZRU deputy chief executive
Steve Tew said.


"In the context of our misconduct process, it was important to
ensure that any additional punishment from the NZRU was
commensurate with the offence."


"The formal warning puts him on notice that we take the matter
very seriously while the requirement for counselling is to help
Siti work to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again."


Sivivatu, who has scored 14 tries in 12 Tests for the All Blacks,
said he was looking forward to being able to concentrate on his
rugby in the future.


"My wife and I are pleased with this result and we will move
forward together from now on," he said.


He was charged after police were called to his home on March 19
after twice slapping his wife.
