A senior official within Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's
Kadima party on Wednesday called on him to resign in the wake of
a damning report over his handling of the Lebanon war.


"The prime minister must act... He must take the decision to
resign so that Kadima can continue with his mandate, as I don't
think that there are early elections in sight," Avigdor Itzchaky,
the chairman of Kadima's parliamentary bloc, told public radio.


"The Kadima party must choose its chief for the three years that
remain for the (current) legislature," he said.
