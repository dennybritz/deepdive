US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed Tuesday a
bill tying funding to the war in Iraq to a timeline for
withdrawal, despite President George W. Bush's pledge to veto it.


"I urge the president to sign the war on terror supplemental,"
Pelosi said as she signed the bill after it was passed by both
chambers of Congress.


The bill, which calls for troops to start withdrawing in October,
now goes to President George W. Bush, who earlier Tuesday
reiterated he would veto the measure, just his second veto in six
years in office.


The bill was presented four years to the day that Bush stood on
the deck of an aircraft carrier returning from the Middle East
under an enormous banner that read "Mission Accomplished," and
declared the end of major military operations in Iraq.
