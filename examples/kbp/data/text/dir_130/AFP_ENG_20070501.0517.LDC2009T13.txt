Five-time champions Liverpool reached the Champions League final
here on Tuesday after beating Chelsea 4-1 on penalties after the
tie ended 1-1 on aggregate.


Liverpool had levelled the clash through Daniel Agger in the 22nd
minute - Chelsea won the first leg 1-0 - while the hosts had a
goal by Dirk Kuyt ruled out in the first-half of extra-time for
offside.


They will meet either AC Milan or Manchester United in the final
on May 23 in Athens.
