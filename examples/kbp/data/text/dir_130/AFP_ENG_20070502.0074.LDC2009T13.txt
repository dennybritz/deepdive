Egyptian police imposed a tight security cordon around the Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Wednesday as world leaders were
poised to gather for key talks on Iraq.


The police were deployed in force around the conference centre
where two day of talks involving officials from close to 50
countries are due to open on Thursday.


Security screening was tightened at the airport and roadblocks
were set up in and around the Sinai town of Sharm el-Sheikh,
which was rocked by deadly suicide bombings in July 2005.


Checkpoints were set up at the entrance of every hotel in the
resort, as US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others
officials were expected to arrive for preliminary talks on
Wednesday.


The popular holiday resort will then on Friday also host wedding
celebrations for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's son, timed to
coincide with his father's 79th birthday.
