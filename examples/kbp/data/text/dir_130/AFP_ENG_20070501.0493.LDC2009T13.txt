Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday unveiled a
reform package, including having future presidents elected by
popular vote instead of by parliament.


The package, which could change the face of Turkish politics,
would require constitutional changes. A current crisis triggered
by a vote to select the next president would first have to be
resolved, however.
