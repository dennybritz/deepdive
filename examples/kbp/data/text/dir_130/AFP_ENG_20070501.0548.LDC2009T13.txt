Australia's central bank on Wednesday left interest rates on hold
at 6.25 percent following a surprise easing of inflationary
pressures.


The Reserve Bank of Australia is now likely to leave interest
rates unchanged for the rest of the year with inflation expected
to fall below the central bank's 2.0 to 3.0 percent target in the
coming quarters, economists said.


The move came after official figures last week revealed that the
consumer price index (CPI) in the three months to March rose just
0.1 percent from the previous quarter and was up 2.4 percent
year-on-year.


Those figures quashed more than a month of frenzied speculation
of an interest rate hike following several indications fears of
inflationary pressure.


The reserve bank made no formal statement on its decision, but it
will release its quarterly monetary policy statement on Friday,
which could provide clues to its thinking on the inflation and
interest rate outlook.
