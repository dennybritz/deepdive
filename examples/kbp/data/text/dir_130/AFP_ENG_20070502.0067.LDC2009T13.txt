The head of the United Nations mission in East Timor started a
tour of the tiny nation Wednesday to assess security ahead of
next week's runoff vote for the presidency.


Atul Khare would meet with local officials in areas where unrest
and intimidation of voters were reported during the presidential
poll last month, the mission said in a statement.


A runoff between Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta and parliament
speaker Francisco Guterres will be held next Wednesday after
neither candidate gained a majority of the vote in the April 9
election.


"In particular, the SRSG (Special Representative of the Secretary
General)  will visit districts that reported incidents of
violence or intimidation, as well as those that experienced lower
voter turn-out during the first round," the statement said.


Khare will visit 16 areas starting Wednesday in western Ermera.


The election, the troubled nation's first since it gained
independence in 2002, was hailed as peaceful and voter turnout
was high, although isolated reports of intimidation were
reported.


Australian-led foreign peacekeepers have been on the streets for
almost a year after unrest between factions of the military and
police descended into gang violence that killed 37 and forced
150,000 to flee their homes.
