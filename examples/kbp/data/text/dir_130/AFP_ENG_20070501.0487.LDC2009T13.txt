Wall Street shares swung higher Tuesday as the market got a late
lift from declining oil prices, pushing the blue-chip Dow Jones
index to its fourth record high in the past five sessions.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 72.33 points (0.55
percent) to 13,135.24, a new all-time high based on provisional
data at the final bell.


The Nasdaq composite gained 6.02 points (0.24 percent) to
2,531.11 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index
added 3.75 points (0.25 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,486.12.


The main indexes had initially opened stronger and then wobbled
after a weaker- than-expected report on pending home sales, amid
a wide-ranging housing downturn.


Analysts at Briefing.com said a two percent drop in crude oil
prices heading into the close "helped improved sentiment" amid
"speculation tomorrow's weekly inventories report will show a
build in oil supplies as some refineries were shut down for
maintenance.
