A Palestinian farmer was wounded Tuesday when Israeli soldiers
opened fire at him near the West Bank village of Ibna, a
Palestinian security source said.


Ibrahim Tmezi, 45, was shot while working in his fields in the
village, near the southern West Bank town of Hebron, the source
said.


An army spokesman said the shooting occurred after the
Palestinian threw stones at an Israeli vehicle, damaging it.


"The soldiers first fired into the air but when this did not help
they aimd at his legs," the spokesman said.


"The Palestinian was taken to hospital in Ashkelon (south of Tel
Aviv) with serious injuries," he added.
