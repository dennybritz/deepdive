Sweden's centre-right government will sell eight percent of its
stake in semi- public Swedish-Finnish telecom operator
TeliaSonera, the biggest in northern Europe, it said on Monday.


"With this sale we will reduce our stake in TeliaSonera in a
responsible way, and at the same time we will remain the biggest
shareholder and thereby have full freedom to make strategic
decisions," Financial Markets Minister Mats Odell said in a
statement.


The Swedish state currently holds 45.3 percent of TeliaSonera and
the Finnish state 13.7 percent.


TeliaSonera's market capitalisation is 246 billion kronor (2.19
billion euros, 2.97 billion dollars), according to Swedish news
agency TT.


The eight percent up for sale, which will be sold only to
institutional investors, is worth 20 billion kronor, it said.


The government, which came to power in October, has announced
plans to sell state holdings in six companies. The other five are
banking group Nordea, OMX stock exchange, wine and spirits
manufacturer Vin och Sprit, real estate company Vasakronan and
mortgage lender SBAB.
