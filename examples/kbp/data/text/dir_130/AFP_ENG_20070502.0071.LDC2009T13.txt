South Korea's top automaker Hyundai Motor said Wednesday its net
profit dropped in the first quarter to March as higher raw
material costs and a stronger won undercut sales.


Net profit fell 10.2 percent year-on-year to 307.4 billion won
(323 million dollars) in the first quarter.


Sales fell 2.6 percent year-on-year to 6.68 trillion won, with
operating profit down 13 percent to 291.4 billion won during the
period.


The firm said it expects profitability to improve in the second
quarter. In April alone, Hyundai Motor's sales came to 225,178,
up 10.4 percent from a year earlier.


Hyundai along with affiliate Kia Motor is the world's sixth-
largest automaker.
