Afghan border police and US-led coalition forces manning a
checkpoint in troubled southern Kandahar province killed five
militants in a gunfight overnight, a military press statement
said Wednesday.


Eight militants driving in three cars opened fire as they were
stopped midnight Tuesday in Maruf district bordering volatile
Zabul province, sparking a gun battle, it said.


"Eight insurgents came out from the vehicles and started firing
on the checkpoint. Afghan border police and coalition forces
returned fire killing five of them," said the statement.


The three remaining insurgents managed to escape during the fire-
fight, it said, adding that there were no casualties among Afghan
police and coalition forces.


In another incident Afghan and coalition forces detained a
suspected organiser of suicide attacks in a raid on a house in
Tani district of southeastern Khost province Wednesday, said a
coalition statement.


"Facilitators like this are simply cowards, exploiting
impressionable people for their own purposes," said spokesman
Major Christopher Belcher.


There are more than 50,000 NATO and US-led troops in Afghanistan
fighting Taliban insurgents alongside Afghan army and police.
