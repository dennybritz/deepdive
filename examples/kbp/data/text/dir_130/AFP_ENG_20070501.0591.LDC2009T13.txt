Jose Calderon scored a career-high 25 points as Toronto stayed in
contention in their first-round playoff series against New Jersey
with a 98-96 victory in game five on Tuesday.


Anthony Parker had 18 points and Morris Peterson added 17 for
Toronto, which bounced back after suffering a pair of double-
digit road losses and trails the series, 3-2.


Game six will be in New Jersey on Friday.


Calderon came through with a clutch performance after T.J. Ford
was hurt at the end of the first period.


The Spaniard took over at the point and scored 10 of his total in
the second quarter for the Raptors, who took a 59-42 lead at
halftime.


Ford was hurt when Nets forward Vince Carter landed on his upper
torso scrambling for a loose ball near the end of the first
period.
