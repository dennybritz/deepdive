A grenade exploded outside a mosque in Indonesia's restive Ambon
city as worshippers gathered for prayers early Wednesday, but
there were no injuries, police said.


"It can now be ascertained that the blast was caused by a hand
grenade, although we do not yet know the precise type of grenade
involved," provincial police spokesman Tommy Napitupulu told AFP.


He said morning prayers at the mosque on the island of Ambon
continued despite the explosion.


The grenade attack was the latest in the past week.


An explosion at a bus station in the city injured nine people on
April 25 and a few hours later, another grenade was thrown at a
house.


Police are investigating whether pro-independence rebels were
behind the blasts. The separatist movement was crushed shortly
after its declaration in 1950 but the rebels regrouped following
the fall of dictator Suharto in 1998.


Ambon was also ravaged by clashes between Muslims and Christians,
which erupted in January 1999.


A peace pact in February 2002 mostly brought an end three years
of strife that left more than 5,000 people dead and hundreds of
thousands homeless.
