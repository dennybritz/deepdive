Japan Airlines Corp. (JAL) remained stuck in the red in the year
to March despite its earlier prediction of a return to profit, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.


JAL has booked a net loss of about 16 billion yen (133.5 million
dollars) for the year to March, missing its forecast of a profit
of three billion yen, the Nikkei said in an online report,
quoting unnamed company sources.


It would be a second consecutive year of red ink for JAL, Asia's
largest carrier, which made a net loss of 47.2 billion yen in the
previous financial year. JAL said it would hold a press
conference later Wednesday.


The Nikkei said the worse-than-expected result was due to a
decision not to count 45 billion yen in deferred tax assets as
profit.


The big loss is likely to prompt JAL to push ahead even more
quickly with restructuring measures, the business daily said.


In February, JAL announced plans to slash 4,300 jobs over three
years as part of a plan aimed at returning the carrier to steady
profits in the face of high oil prices and sluggish demand.


JAL said then that it aimed to reduce its personnel costs by 50
billion yen by March 2008 and boost its workforce productivity by
10 percent.


The move came less than two years after JAL announced it would
axe almost 6,000 positions.


The airline has suffered a series of highly publicised safety
scares that sent customers into the arms of rival All Nippon
Airways.
