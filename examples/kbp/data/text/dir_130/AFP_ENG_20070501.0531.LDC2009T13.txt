Vonage on Tuesday asked a US appeals court to undo its conviction
for violating patents of rival Verizon and to grant it a new
trial under the auspices of a recent Supreme Court ruling.


The cut-rate, Internet-based telephone service contends a Supreme
Court finding Monday set a new and relevant standard concerning
when an invention is too obvious to merit patent protection.


"We are very encouraged by the Supreme Court's decision and the
giant step it represents towards achieving much-needed patent
reform in this country," said chief executive Jeffrey Citron.


"The Supreme Court's decision should have positive implications
for Vonage and our pending patent litigation with Verizon."


Verizon filed suit against Vonage in US District Court for the
Virginia Eastern District in 2006, accusing the Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP) firm of infringing on five of its
patents involving online telephony.


A two-week trial ended on March 8 with jurors finding that New
Jersey-based Vonage had infringed on three Verizon's patents.


The jury ordered the start-up to pay Verizon 58 million dollars
for its transgressions and to pay Verizon royalties amounting to
5.5 percent of revenues if it continues using the technology.


Vonage said in April that it is paying royalties of 5.5 percent
into an escrow account to be held for Verizon until the appeals
process is exhausted.


Vonage is appealing the award, arguing that Verizon is due no
money in the case.
