Canada's giant basking sharks face extinction because of
government measures decades ago to stop them disrupting salmon
fishing, an official committee on threatened species said on
Tuesday.


"Up until 1970, there was a government sponsored program to
eradicate these sharks because they were interfering with the
net," Jeff Hutchings, president of the Committee on the Status of
Endangered Wildlife in Canada, told AFP.


He said the government fisheries department ran a program in
which it "took boats and rammed into these sharks to kill them
because these large fishes were interfering with salmon nets."


The toothless basking shark swims near the surface with its jaws
wide open to swallow plankton and small fish. It is the biggest
fish in the sea and can grow to the length of a bus.


Hutchinson estimated the decline in their numbers at more than 90
percent. The trend threatens the species with extinction,
compounded by the creature's extra long three-and-a-half year
gestation period to produce young.


Salmon fishers in western Canada often used to find basking
sharks caught in their nets, but only six of the huge creatures
have turned up since 1996, he said.


"When the population collapses it's going to take a very long
time to recover if they can at all," Hutchinson said. "If only
six have been seen in the last decade there must be very few of
them left in the Pacific Ocean."
