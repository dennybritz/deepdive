Hong Kong share prices opened 0.32 percent higher Wednesday with
investor interest sparked by another strong Wall Street finish,
and HSBC helping to drive a market rebound, dealers said.


HSBC found solid support following news that a unit of Dubai
International Capital LLC (DIC) has made a substantial investment
in HSBC Holdings PLC.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index opened up 65.05 points at
20,384.03.


The market was closed Tuesday for a public holiday.
