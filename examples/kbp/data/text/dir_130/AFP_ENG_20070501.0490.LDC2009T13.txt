Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that he
would ask for early legislative elections after the country's top
court annulled a parliamentary vote to elect the next president.


"We will apply to parliament at once, tomorrow (Wednesday)
morning, to bring general elections forward," Erdogan told a news
conference after a meeting of his Justice and Development Party's
(AKP) leadership.


"For us, the election date could be June 24 or July 1 because
those are the earliest possible dates to hold elections," he
added.


Legislative elections are currently set for November 4.


The first-round presidential poll was declared invalid after the
court found a quorum of lawmakers was not present when it passed
a vote on Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, the sole candidate and a
member of the AKP.


Parliamentary minutes show there were only 361 lawmakers present
for the vote. Gul needed an absolutely majority of 367 to be
elected but only secured 357 votes.


The election process has triggered a deep crisis in Turkey, with
the military threatening to intervene if it felt the country's
secular system was threatened. It is wary of the AKP, which has
Islamist roots.
