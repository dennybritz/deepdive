Canada expects very soon to reach a free trade deal with South
Korea and to see a ban on its beef exports lifted, visiting
Foreign Minister Peter MacKay said Wednesday.


A free trade agreement "offers a very valuable win-win
opportunity. We also hope to see a successful resolution in the
very near future to the ban on Canadian beef," he told a press
conference.


South Korea suspended US and Canadian beef imports in 2003 after
mad-cow cases were discovered in animals in the two countries.
Free trade talks between Seoul and Ottawa began in July 2005.


The minister said the two issues were not directly linked. "But
there's no question it would be politically unpalatable for us to
have an ongoing beef ban and to expect we will be able to finally
ink this free trade agreement."


Seoul, he said, is "very close" to lifting restrictions on
Canadian beef, with the World Organisation for Animal Health due
to decide this month on the safety of US and Canadian beef.


"Similarly, I would say we are extremely close to reaching that
point where we can sign (an FTA)," MacKay said.


South Korea last month signed a landmark free trade deal with the
United States and begins talks Monday with the European Union.


It has signed FTAs with Chile and Singapore. A pact with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, excluding Thailand, will
take effect on June 1.


MacKay, who arrived from Beijing where he had talks with his
Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi, also said China "is prepared to
work with the international community to push North Korea in the
right direction" on denuclearisation.
