South Korea on Wednesday confiscated the property of nine people
who collaborated with Japan when the Korean peninsula was
colonised in 1910, a state agency said.


The Investigative Commission On Pro-Japanese Collaborators'
Property said the nine included Lee Wan-Yong, Song Byung-Joon and
Kwon Jung-Hyun and six others who helped Japan colonise the
country.


As reward for their work, they received Japanese court titles and
money from Tokyo.


"This is only the beginning," Jang Mi-Jeong, spokesman of the
commission, told AFP, adding the agency would continue
investigating and confiscating assets acquired as a result of
collaborating with Japan.


Under a special law enacted in 2005, the commission has listed
452 people who collaborated with the 1910-1945 colonisation.


Land seized by the state Wednesday was estimated to be worth 3.6
billion won (3.9 million dollars).


The government plans to use the proceeds from the confiscated
assets to compensate pro-independence activists and their
offspring, the commission said.


It marks the first time since the peninsula was liberated in 1945
that South Korea has taken action against alleged collaborators.


A similar move was foiled in 1949 due to strong protests from the
collaborators backed by the then president Syngman Rhee.
