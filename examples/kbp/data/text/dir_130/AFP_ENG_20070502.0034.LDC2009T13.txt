A senior official within Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's
Kadima party on Wednesday called on him to resign in the wake of
a damning report over his handling of the Lebanon war.


"The prime minister must act... He must take the decision to
resign so that Kadima can continue with his mandate, as I don't
think that there are early elections in sight," Avigdor Itzchaky,
the chairman of Kadima's parliamentary bloc, told public radio.


"The Kadima party must choose its chief for the three years that
remain for the (current) legislature," he said.


Olmert has called an extraordinary cabinet meeting on Wednesday
to discuss the interim report by the Winograd Commission on last
year's 34-day war against Lebanon's Hezbollah militia that was
made public on Monday.


Monday's partial report accused Olmert of "serious failure in
exercising judgement, responsibility and prudence," of acting
"hastily" and personally contributing to "over-ambitious" and
unfeasible war aims.


Speaking late on Monday, Olmert told the nation it would be
"incorrect" for him to resign. He vowed that his government,
already reeling from a string of sex and corruption scandals,
would now focus quickly to correct the faults.


Israel failed to achieve its two main objectives of liberating
two soldiers whose capture by Hezbollah sparked the war on July
12, and to stop the Shiite militia from firing rockets into the
Jewish state.
