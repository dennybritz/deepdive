Geoff Hoon, the British defence secretary during the March 2003
invasion of Iraq, admitted in an interview published Wednesday
that Britain and the United States had not properly planned what
would happen after the invasion.


Hoon, now in the lesser position of minister for Europe, also
said that he and his colleagues had disagreed with their American
counterparts over key decisions taken in the Iraq war, but had
under-estimated the role of the US vice- president.


Speaking to The Guardian, Hoon conceded that "we didn't plan for
the right sort of aftermath."


"Maybe we were too optimistic about the idea of the streets being
lined with cheering people," he said.


He continued to say that history would have to be the judge of
whether coalition planners should have anticipated the level of
violence between rival Sunni and Shiite communities in Iraq.


"Given what we know now, I suppose the answer is that we should
(have known), but we did not know that at the time."


Hoon told the daily that US Vice-President Dick Cheney wielded
more power than the British had anticipated, in comparison to
then defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and secretary of state
Colin Powell, in terms of President George W. Bush's decision-
making.


Sometimes, Prime Minister Tony Blair "had made his point with the
president, and I'd made my point with Don and (then foreign
secretary) Jack (Straw) had made his point with Colin, and the
decision actually came out of a completely different place."


"And you think: what did we miss? I think we missed Cheney."


The British defence ministry declined to comment on the
interview.
