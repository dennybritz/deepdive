Former Japan striker Keiji Tamada has been sidelined for about
five weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot, his J-League
club Nagoya Grampus Eight said on their website.


Tamada, who scored the only goal for Japan in a 4-1 loss to
Brazil in the 2006 World Cup first round, has since not been
called up by Bosnian Ivica Osim who took over from Brazilian
legend Zico as national coach last July.


The 27-year-old Tamada broke the fifth metatarsal in his right
foot during training on April 24, according to the Nagoya
statement posted on Tuesday.


Former Messina reserve forward Yanagisawa, another World Cup
veteran who has failed to make Osim's squad after their nine
international matches, has also been put on the injured list.


The 29-year-old Kashima Antlers striker suffered a broken bone in
his left foot in a J-League match 10 days ago and will be out for
some three months.
