Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday night
unveiled a reform package, including presidential election by
popular vote, that could change the face of Turkish politics.


"Going to the nation is the best way," Erdogan said, speaking
after a two-hour meeting of the leadership of his Islamist-rooted
governing Justice and Development Party.


The Turkish president is currently elected by the single-chamber
parliament.


Erdogan told reporters he hoped to push the proposal for a two-
round presidential election by popular vote through the current
session of parliament, before early general elections he said
should take place on June 24 or July 1.


He also proposed modifying the presidency to run for a once-
renewable, five-year mandate instead of the current single,
seven-year mandate.


Erdogan suggested holding legislative elections every four years
instead of the current five, and asked for a speedy
constitutional amendment that would allow an already enacted
change in the basic law, reducing the age of parliamentary
eligibility to 25, to be applied in the coming vote.
