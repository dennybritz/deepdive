Japanese share prices rose 0.21 percent in morning trade on
Wednesday after Wall Street's Dow Jones index set another record
high overnight, dealers said.


They said, however, that trading was quiet ahead of a four-day
holiday weekend in Tokyo.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
gained 37.05 points to 17,312.03 by the lunch break.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares edged up 0.84
points or 0.05 percent to 1,694.09.


Decliners outnumbered gainers 813 to 726, with 183 issues flat.


Volume declined to 790 million shares from 884 million on
Tuesday.


Fumiyuki Nakanishi, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities,
said the market managed to stay in positive territory after the
Dow hit another record high overnight and the yen traded weaker.


But he added: "Trading was quiet and investors did not want to
take new positions" before the holidays.


As Japan's financial market will be closed Thursday and Friday,
investors were looking ahead of Friday's US employment report for
April.


Bridgestone Corp advanced 70 yen or 2.9 percent to 2,510 after
the largest Japanese tyre maker upgraded its earnings projections
for the half year to June, citing the positive impact of a weak
yen and brisk sales.


Steel makers were higher. Nippon Steel added nine yen or 1.1
percent to 806, Kobe Steel rose 11 yen or 2.6 percent to 429 and
JEF Holdings gained 160 yen or 2.4 percent to 6,820.


Among automakers, Nissan Motor lost 13 yen or 1.1 percent to
1,207, Isuzu Motors fell nine yen or 1.4 percent to 642 and
Toyota Motor dropped 70 yen or 0.96 percent to 7,200, while Mazda
Motor advanced 22 yen or 3.5 percent to 654.
