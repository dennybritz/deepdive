AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini will miss his side's crucial
Champions League semi-final second leg clash against Manchester
united at the San Siro stadium, his coach Carlo Ancelotti said on
Tuesday night.


"Maldini is with the team but he is not available for tomorrow's
(Wednesday's) game," Ancelotti told Milan's official television
channel.


The 38-year-old veteran of four previous Champions League and
European Cup victories left the field at half-time of the first
leg in Manchester.


Milan were leading 2-1 at the time but went on to lose 3-2
without his services at the back to contain United's forwards.


He should be replaced by either Daniele Bonera or Kakha Kaladze
as Alessandro Nesta's centre-back partner.
