Japanese share prices rose 0.21 percent in morning trade on
Wednesday after Wall Street's Dow Jones index set another record
high overnight, dealers said.


They said, however, that trading was quiet ahead of a four-day
holiday weekend in Tokyo.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
gained 37.05 points to 17,312.03 by the lunch break.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares edged up 0.84
points or 0.05 percent to 1,694.09.
