Sri Lankan military jets bombed suspected Tamil Tiger targets for
a second straight day Wednesday, carrying out "successful
attacks," authorities said.


A suspected communications facility of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was bombed at Puthukkudiriruppu, the defence
ministry said.


"Another air strike hit a Tiger intelligence leaders' gathering
at a place east of Kilinochchi today," the ministry said in a
statement. "The air force confirms the attacks were successful."


The statement did not detail what damage was caused. The ministry
said a suspected Tiger training camp was also bombed on Tuesday,
but gave no details.


Air force spokesman Group Captain Ajantha Silva said there was no
immediate information about rebel casualties.


More than 4,000 people were killed between December 2005 and the
first week of March 2007 across the island, including 675
civilians and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence
ministry figures.


The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
