Security officials at Cairo airport confiscated 400 freshwater
turtles being smuggled into the country by a Syrian on an
EgyptAir flight from Damascus, an airport source said on
Wednesday.


"The passenger was carrying a cooler and had an anxious look on
his face which aroused the suspicions of customs agents," who
then opened the container to find 400 tiny living turtles, added
the source.


The import of these turtles is forbidden under Egypt's
environmental laws and the creatures, discovered late on Tuesday,
were taken by the airport veterinary service and sent to Giza
Zoo.
