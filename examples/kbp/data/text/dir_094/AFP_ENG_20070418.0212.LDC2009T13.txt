British anti-nuclear campaigners voiced shock and dismay
Wednesday at the killing of the mayor of Nagasaki Iccho Ito, shot
allegedly by a member of the nation's largest underworld gang.


"We are shocked and saddened by the death of Mayor Ito," said
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament head Kate Hudson after Ito was
shot outside his offices in Nagasaki, a city forever linked to
the 1945 atomic bomb that devastated it.


"This senseless act of violence has taken from the world a strong
voice for peace and sanity through the abolition of nuclear
weapons," she added.


Hiroshi Taka, General Secretary of Gensuikyo, the Japan Council
against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said Ito "stood in the
forefront in the effort to abolish nuclear weapons."


"The role played by the mayor in pursuit of a nuclear weapon-free
world was irreplaceable," he added, in a CND statement.


Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe branded the slaying as a
challenge to democracy, and authorities pledged to tighten
security around political leaders ahead of local polls Sunday in
which the mayor was campaigning for re-election.


After the shooting Japanese police immediately arrested a gunman
who is said to be connected to Japan's largest underworld
syndicate, the Yamaguchi-gumi.
