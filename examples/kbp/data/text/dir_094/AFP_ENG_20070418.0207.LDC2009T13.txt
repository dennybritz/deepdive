Sri Lanka warned Wednesday it may expel foreign diplomats who
meddle in the island's internal affairs and said at least one
unnamed envoy was being investigated.


The threat comes amid growing international criticism of Sri
Lanka's human rights record and Colombo's resistance to
suggestions that United Nations monitors should be sent to the
island.


Sri Lanka's government has also been highly critical of
international non- governmental organisations and often accuses
them of supporting Tamil Tiger guerrillas.


Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said several diplomats were
interfering in local politics and action was being taken against
at least one.


He noted that the country had deported the former British high
commissioner (ambassador) David Gladstone in August 1991 after he
complained to local police about election rigging.


"We will not compromise our sovereignty and we will take action
against anyone exceeding their mandate and meddling in our
affairs," said Rambukwella.


More than 4,000 people have been killed since December 2005 as
fighting between government troops and separatist Tamil Tiger
rebels escalated despite a truce that is in place since 2002.
