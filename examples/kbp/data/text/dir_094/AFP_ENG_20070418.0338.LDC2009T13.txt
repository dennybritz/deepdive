The star of Oscar-winning South African film "Tsotsi" pleaded
guilty Wednesday to a charge of being in possession of a fake
driving licence as he appeared before a court in the capital
Pretoria.


Presley Chweneyagae, who gained international fame last year when
the movie, a raw depiction of Johannesburg's criminal underworld,
scooped the best foreign film award, was given a fine of 5,000
rand (700 US dollars) or six months in jail.


He only managed to pay 3000 rand which was in his possession on
the spot and he will settle the outstanding amount at a later
stage, SAPA news agency reported.


Chweneyagae, 22, was arrested in January and charged with fraud
after trying to convert an Ivory Coast driver's licence into a
South African one.


Several local and foreign suspects have already been prosecuted
for their part in a syndicate involved in converting stolen
foreign licences into local ones. Chweneyagae agreed to help in
the inquiry as part of a plea bargain.


In the movie, Chweneyagae plays a tsotsi, a colloquial term for
thug, who undergoes a sea change when he carjacks a vehicle with
a baby in the back seat.
