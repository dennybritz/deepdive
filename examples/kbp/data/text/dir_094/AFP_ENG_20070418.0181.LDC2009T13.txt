Sri Lanka is investigating the conduct of a unidentified foreign
diplomat for allegedly meddling in the island's internal affairs,
the government said Wednesday.


Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the government was aware that
several diplomats were interfering in local politics and action
was being initiated against at least one individual.


He declined to name the diplomat or elaborate on the meddling
allegations, but noted that Sri Lanka had deported a British high
commissioner (ambassador) in August 1991.


"It has been brought to the notice of the foreign ministry that
certain diplomats are working outside their mandate and
meddling," Rambukwella told reporters. "We have informed the
relevant authorities."


His remarks came amid growing international criticism of Sri
Lanka's human rights record and Colombo's resistance to
suggestions that United Nations human rights monitors should be
sent to the island.


More than 4,000 people have been killed since december 2005 as
fighting between government troops and separatist Tamil Tiger
rebels escalated despite a truce that has been in place since
2002.
