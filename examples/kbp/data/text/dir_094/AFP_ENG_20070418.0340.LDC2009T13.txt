A small bomb hidden in a motorcycle killed a businessman leaving
his office just outside central Moscow on Wednesday, the
prosecutor general's office said.


The victim was identified as the head of Blagvest, a company
listed in local business directories as a supplier of alcoholic
drinks.


A device containing the equivalent of 500 grams of explosives was
planted in the motorcycle and left near the entrance to the
company's office, the statement said adding that four people had
been injured in the blast.


Prosecutors opened a criminal case into the incident.
