Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski appealed to the European
Commission Wednesday to stop making decisions that might slow
down development in the former communist state.


"I come to Brussels with kind of an appeal: let us develop
rapidly. Avoid decisions that will increase our development
costs," he told reporters travelling with him.


"Several decisions of this kind have been taken recently," he
said.


While Kaczynski did not specify any, tensions between the
Commission, the EU's executive body, and Poland have been high
notably over a number of environmental issues.


The Commission, for example, has taken action at Europe's top
court to stop road work undertaken by Warsaw in a significant and
fragile forest ecosystem in the northeast of the country.


The planned stretch of highway is part of the so-called Via
Baltica corridor, a major roadlink for the Baltic states meant to
smooth the way for increasing trade between eastern and western
Europe.


To ease traffic near the town of Augustow, Polish transport
authorities are building a bypass road through the Rospuda River
valley and Brussels is trying to get the work halted.


Poland has been earmarked significant EU funds in the 2007-2013
budget for the Via Baltica project, although none have yet been
allocated. Warsaw has said it will use its own money to pay for
the Rospuda River bypass.


The Commission has also contested Poland's plan to cut carbon-
dioxide emissions for the 2008-2012 period.
