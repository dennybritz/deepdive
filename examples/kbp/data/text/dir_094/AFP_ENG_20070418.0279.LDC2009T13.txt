Chopping down Amazonian rainforest to plant soybeans is even more
damaging to the environment than using the land for cattle
pasture, according to a study reported on Wednesday.


Soybean fields in Brazil reduce local rainfall by four times as
much as pasture land, the British weekly New Scientist said.


The reason: soybean fields are light in colour, which means they
reflect a lot of solar radiation.


As a result, the surface of the field is heated less, which in
turn reduces the amount of warm air convected from the ground.
That means fewer clouds form, and ultimately less precipitation
falls.


The study, by Federal University of Vicosa researchers in Brazil,
appears in a specialist journal, Geophysical Research Letters.


On forest plots that had been cleared for soybean there was a
15.7 percent decrease in rainfall, while the same clearance for
pasture produced a 3.9 percent decrease, the scientists found.


Around a seventh of the original Brazilian rainforest has been
destroyed for agriculture so far, New Scientist said.


Eighty-five percent of this land use had gone to cattle pasture,
and 15 percent to soybean, a crop whose popularity is fast
expanding as a food and biofuel.
