EU trade chief Peter Mandelson said Wednesday that he could "not
rule out" opening a case against China for its failure to protect
intellectual property rights, like the United States has done.


"I do not rule out initiating or joining action at the WTO (World
Trade Organisation) if in our view China is failing to take its
responsibilties seriously," he told journalists in Brussels.


"China has agreed to protect (intellectual property rights). It
did so when it joined the WTO and despite considerable efforts by
the Chinese government, IPR protection in China reamins patchy
and uneven," he added.
