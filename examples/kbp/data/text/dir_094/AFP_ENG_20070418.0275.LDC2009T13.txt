In a hurry to get hitched? How about boarding the "wedding train"
being offered by a Saint Petersburg rail company to start your
married life?


The rail project is to be unveiled by the Oktyabrskaya railway
company at a ceremony in Russia's romantic former capital Saint
Petersburg on Wednesday.


"Newly weds will have the chance to marry, celebrate their
wedding, and go on honeymoon on their own wedding train," the
company said in a press release.


Holding the ceremony in the specially designed chapel provided on
board could mean a slightly jolting start to married life.


But the company insisted in a press release that there would be
plenty of space for guests and none of the metallic squeals and
painful bumps that sometimes accompany Russian train journeys.


With a reception carriage, an entertainments carriage and two
restaurant cars there will be room for 100 guests, the company
said.


A video facility will be in place for relaying congratulations
from absent friends.


And if the newly-weds tire of the company they have brought with
them, they can at least retreat to their own "Grand De Luxe"
compartment, tastefully decorated with flowers and balloons, to
continue their roll through Russia's vast expanses.
