EU trade chief Peter Mandelson refused to rule out Wednesday
opening a case against China for its failure to protect
intellectual property rights, like the United States has done.


"I do not rule out initiating or joining action at the WTO (World
Trade Organisation) if in our view China is failing to take its
responsibilities seriously," he told journalists in Brussels.


"China has agreed to protect (intellectual property rights). It
did so when it joined the WTO and despite considerable efforts by
the Chinese government, IPR protection in China remains patchy
and uneven," he added.


Earlier this month, the United States formally lodged a complaint
against China at the World Trade Organisation over copyright
piracy, with fake DVDs and counterfeited luxury goods adding to
existing tensions between the trading giants.


Mandelson stressed the European Union expected a "dialogue" with
Chinese authorities about improving protection of intellectual
property rights to bear fruit.


"As we're seeing in the United States, Europe's patience could
wear thin if we do not see our dialogue with the Chinese
authorities delivering more change when it comes to IPR and other
market access issues," he said.


Chinese officials say that they have limited resources to combat
the trade of counterfeit goods, such as DVDs, music CDs, apparel,
and other brand-name fashion items, which are freely available in
large cities in China.
