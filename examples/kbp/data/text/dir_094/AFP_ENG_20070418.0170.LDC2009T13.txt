Saudi Arabia has agreed to cancel 80 percent of Iraq's multi-
billion-dollar debt to them in a major gesture to the county's
mainly Shiite government, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.


The oil-rich kingdom agreed to the write-off at a meeting here
with Iraq's Finance Minister Bayan Jabr, the daily said, citing
Jabr and Saudi officials.


The Saudis resisted a call from Jabr to cancel 100 percent of the
debt.


It is nevertheless a major step for the predominantly Sunni
Muslim kingdom, which has previously been reluctant to provide
financial help to the Shiite- dominated government in its war-
torn neighbor.


United States President George W. Bush in January urged the
international community to follow its example by canceling Iraq's
foreign debts and helping rebuild the war-torn country.


The newspaper said Jabr in an interview placed his country's
total foreign debts at 140 billion dollars (103 billion euros),
most of it due to loans dating to the time of Iraq's war with
Iran from 1980 to 1988.


Saudi officials estimated Iraq's debt to their country at between
15 to 18 billion dollars, it said.
