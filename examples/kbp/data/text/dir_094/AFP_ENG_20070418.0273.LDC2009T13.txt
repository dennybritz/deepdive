Nigerian soldiers on Wednesday shot dead at least 25 Islamic
militants during an operation to dislodge them from northern city
of Kano, an army spokesman said.


"I understand that our troops killed at least 25 members of the
criminal group terrorising Kano. The operation to flush them out
is still on," Colonel Ayo Olaniyan told AFP.


Members of the Islamist group had attacked a suburban police post
in broad daylight on Tuesday, killing the station chief, his wife
and 11 officers.
