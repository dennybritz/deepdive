Iran's political and military influence is growing in
neighbouring Afghanistan with Iranian-made weapons reaching the
Taliban militia, a US official said Wednesday.


"It's been a developing issue of concern about Iran," US
Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs
Richard Boucher told reporters in Brussels.


While Iran had been playing a helpful role in areas such as
tackling the narcotics trade and in cultural and educational
areas, the latest signs were worrying, he said.


"There have been a series of indicators that Iran is getting
involved in a more unhealthy way," he said.


US military chief General Peter Pace said Tuesday that coalition
forces had intercepted Iranian-made mortars and explosives in
Afghanistan destined for the Taliban.


Boucher confirmed these reports while adding that it remained
unclear exactly who was providing the weapons.


"We don't know who is doing this or why but we know that these
are Iranian origin weapons that have shown up in the hands of the
Taliban," he said.


There were also "reports of involvement in political areas," he
added.


The way to tackle the Taliban militia is to expand the control of
the Afghan government, he said, but neutralising its military
threat, particularly its suicide attacks, would be a lengthy
process.


He urged the international community to make a greater effort in
Afghanistan and for NATO member countries to drop their "caveats"
which impose conditions on what their troops do and where they
are sent.
