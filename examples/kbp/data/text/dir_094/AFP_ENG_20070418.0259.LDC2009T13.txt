An explosion at a munitions depot near the eastern French city of
Metz killed two people and injured another Wednesday, police
said.


Two employees of the interior ministry's mine-clearing services
were killed in the blast that occurred late morning in a building
where conventional munitions from both world wars were stored,
said police.


Munitions found in nearby former battlefields were kept at the
storage site in Ressaincourt pending their destruction.


Police said there were no chemical weapons at the storage depot,
located in a wooded area far from residential areas.


An investigation into the causes of the explosion was under way.
