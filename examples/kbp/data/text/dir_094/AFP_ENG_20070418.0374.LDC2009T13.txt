Wall Street shares retreated in opening trade Wednesday as
disappointing earnings from the high-tech sector prompted profit
taking a day after blue chips flirted with record highs.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.43 points (0.07 percent)
to 12,763.61 in the first exchanges after the blue-chip index
ended just shy of its all-time record closing high on Tuesday.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dropped 8.37 points (0.33
percent) to 2,508.58 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's
declined 2.95 points (0.20) percent to 1,468.53.


The market action came amid a lukewarm response to earnings
reports from the tech sector, especially Yahoo, which said
profits sagged 11 percent under the weight of operating expenses
despite the promising launch of its overhauled Panama advertising
platform.


Meanwhile earnings from Intel and IBM were "uninspiring,"
according to Dick Green at Briefing.com, prompting some selling.


"The technology sector is forecast to supply a good portion of
the earnings growth for the S&P this year, but these
companies are off to a decidedly mixed start," Green said.
