Sri Lanka's military Wednesday removed a suspected limpet mine
from the hull of a cargo ship, but later found it to be a
magnetic device used for fishing, the navy said.


Navy spokesman D. P. K. Dassanayake said they were alerted to the
device attached to the hull of a ship which docked at the port of
Trincomalee in the northeast of the island.


"We have removed it and found it was a sonar device used to track
fishing grounds," Dassanayake said. "There were no explosives in
it."


Trincomalee port is in government-held territory but close to the
frontline with the rebel Tamil Tigers' territory in the north of
the island.


"As the ship was being unloaded, dock workers noticed the device
attached to the hull and alerted the navy," a police source said.


The port is used as the main naval base for operations against
Tamil Tiger guerrillas.


The Tigers last year shelled the port using long-range artillery.
