South Africa has no magic solution to the problems in its
troubled neighbour Zimbabwe, Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-
Zuma said Wednesday.


Dlamini-Zuma was hopeful that efforts by President Thabo Mbeki to
mediate between veteran leader Robert Mugabe's government and
opposition Movement for Democratic Change would yield positive
results but said it would take time and the outcome was up to the
people of Zimbabwe.


"South Africa can't do any magic," said Dlamini-Zuma.


Mbeki was mandated last month by fellow leaders in the region to
defuse the crisis in Zimbabwe, characterised by a brutal
crackdown on opposition members.


As the country, faced by an economic meltdown and mounting
political violence, celebrated 27 years of independence from
Britain, Dlamini-Zuma said the day was a time for reflection.


"When you celebrate your independence you look at your past but
also look at your present and your future. I'm sure they'll do
that," the SAPA news agency quoted her as saying.
