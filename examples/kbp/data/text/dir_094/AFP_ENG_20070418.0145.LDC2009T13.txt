British private equity firm Apax Partners is interested in buying
a major stake in German sportswear maker Adidas in a move that
could lead to a full takeover bid, the Financial Times reported
on Wednesday.


The newspaper quoted traders as saying that Apax was preparing a
tender offer to Adidas shareholders at 50 euros (68 dollars) per
share to buy a 25-percent stake in the German firm.


A successful tender offer would help fend off competition from
rival private equity groups known to be circling Adidas, FT said.


The newspaper said that Apax had refused to comment on the
information.


Adidas is the world's second biggest supplier of sportswear and
apparel after Nike in the United States.


Adidas' close German rival, Puma, is being bought by French
luxury goods empire PPR.


Adidas shares were the top gainers on the Frankfurt stock
exchange on Wednesday, where they were showing a gain of 1.23
euros or 2.73 percent at 46.33 euros in late morning trade.
