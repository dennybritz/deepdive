An Australian scientist called Wednesday for an end to the age-
old tradition of cremation, saying the practice contributed to
global warming.


Professor Roger Short said people could instead choose to help
the environment after death by being buried in a cardboard box
under a tree.


The decomposing bodies would provide the tree with nutrients, and
the tree would convert carbon dioxide into life-giving oxygen for
decades, he said.


"The important thing is, what a shame to be cremated when you go
up in a big bubble of carbon dioxide," Short told AFP.


"Why waste all that carbon dioxide on your death?"


Short said the cremation of the average male in Australia, during
which the body is heated to 850 degrees Celsius (1,562 degrees
Fahrenheit) for 90 minutes, produced more than 50 kilograms (110
pounds) of carbon dioxide.


And that doesn't include the carbon cost of fuel, or the cost of
the emissions released during the production and burning of the
wooden casket.


Short, a reproductive biologist at the University of Melbourne,
said the contribution of cremation to harmful greenhouse gases
was small, and he did not wish to prevent people from choosing
how their body was disposed of according to their religion.


But to bury the hatchet with environmentalists, he suggested it
would not be a bad idea to bequeath one's body as food for a
forest.


"You can actually do, after your death, an enormous amount of
good for the planet," he said. "The more forests you plant, the
better."
