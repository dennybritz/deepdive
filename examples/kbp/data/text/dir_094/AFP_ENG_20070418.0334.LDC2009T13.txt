Russia's Nikolay Davydenko became the first major seed to exit
the Monte Carlo Masters on Wednesday, after his 6-4, 6-7 (6/8),
6-3 second round defeat to Sweden's Robin Soderling.


Davydenko, the third seed, has thus been beaten twice in his only
two clay contests this season having been beaten in a Davis Cup
rubber by Frenchman Paul- Henri Mathieu.


Three other seeds advanced to the third round on another sunny
day on the Mediterranean coast.


Spain's Tommy Robredo overwhelmed Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-3,
6-2 while fast- rising Serb Novak Djokovic, seeded sixth, put out
2004 French Open winner Gaston Gaudio.


The Argentine, a 2006 semi-finalist here, has hit the skids on
his favoured surface this season, winning just four of ten
matches. He lifted his last title at Kitzbuehel in 2005.


Djokovic, who made his top ten breakthrough in recent weeks after
an Indian Wells final and his title in Miami, said: "Today's
match was difficult for me.


"It's a first match on the clay, different surface, different
style of the game, and different movement. I had to be more
focused.


"I still cannot find exactly the game for the clay."


Czech Tomas Berdych mowed down Benjamin Becker, defeating the
German  6-1, 6-2.


Two-time defending champion Rafael Nadal was putting a 62-match
clay winning streak on the line against Argentine Juan Chela.


The Spaniard's run of form began in Monte Carlo two years ago
with a first round win over France's Gael Monfils. His last loss
on clay came to Igor Andreev in the quarter-finals of Valencia
that spring.
