Taliban militants shot dead the principal of a girls' school in
eastern Afghanistan Tuesday, police said, in their latest assault
on the war-shattered country's education system.


Ghulam Haider, the headmaster of Kundi girls' school in Khost
province, was killed while heading to the mosque for his morning
prayers, police official Wazir Padshah told AFP.


"The terrorists, the enemies of education in this country killed
him," Padshah said, using the phrase employed by Afghan officials
to refer to the fundamentalist Islamic Taliban militia.


Another headmaster was killed in a similar shooting in the
province's Gorboz district on Sunday. The Taliban were also
blamed for that killing.


Khost province borders Pakistan, where Afghan officials say
Taliban militants take shelter and regroup after launching
attacks in Afghanistan. Islamabad says it is doing all it can to
clamp down on them.


More than 40 teachers have been killed in Taliban attacks on
schools and colleges in 12 months, most of them in southern
Afghanistan, Education Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar told AFP in
March.


The Taliban were ousted by US-led forces in 2001 and have since
led an increasingly violent insurgency.


Human Rights Watch said on Monday that nearly 700 civilians were
killed in rebel-linked violence since the start of 2006.
