Thailand's top energy firm PTT said Wednesday it would buy local
petrol stations run by Conoco Phillips, the third-largest US oil
company, for about 200 million dollars.


Under a deal worth over seven billion baht (200 million dollars),
PTT will take over 147 gasoline stations in Thailand, which are
currently operated by Conoco Phillips, a senior Thai company
official said.


The state-controlled petroleum giant controls some 30 percent of
the Thai oil market and its biggest shareholder is the Thai
finance ministry with a 52.48-percent stake.
