Rwanda has filed a complaint with the UN's highest court over a
French judge issuing arrest warrants against close associates of
President Paul Kagame, Rwandan officials told AFP Wednesday.


In the documents filed with the International Court of Justice
(ICJ), Rwanda says the arrest warrants issued as part of an
investigation into the death of Kagame's predecessor "violate its
sovereignty and curtail its capacity to function freely and
normally as a sovereign state" and "set a dangerous precedent".


However, the case is highly unlikely to ever come before the
United Nations judges as France must recognise the competence of
the ICJ in this case, something that is not expected to happen,
before it can move forward.


The court will now send the complaint to France, but if Paris
does not respond or refuses to recognise the competence of the
ICJ in the matter the process will grind to a halt.


Last November, Jean-Louis Bruguiere, France's top anti-terrorism
judge issued warrants for nine top Rwandan officials and said
Kagame should face trial for the assassination of his
predecessor, Juvenal Habyarimana.


Bruguiere is heading an investigation into the deadly 1994 attack
against Rwanda's former president that triggered the African
nation's genocide in which some 800,000 people perished.


The international arrest warrants state that the nine officials,
all close associates of Kagame, are wanted for assassination or
complicity in assassination.
