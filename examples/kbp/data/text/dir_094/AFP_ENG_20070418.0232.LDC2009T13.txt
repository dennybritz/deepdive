A string of bombings killed at least 17 people in Baghdad on
Wednesday, said security officials, in the latest defiance of a
massive Iraqi-US security crackdown in the war-torn capital.


The deadliest attack killed at least 10 civilians when a car bomb
exploded on a main road near a private hospital in the central
Karrada district, formerly upmarket but fallen on hard times
since the 2003 US-led invasion.


Security officials confirmed women and children were among the
casualties.


An official at the interior ministry said 10 people died and 12
were wounded, but an official at the defence ministry put the
number of dead at 11 civilians with another 13 people wounded.


On the western outskirts of Baghdad, a suicide bomber blew up his
car targeting a police patrol, killing four policemen and
wounding six civilians, the security official in the defence
ministry said.


In another attack, a bomb hidden in a parked car killed three
civilians and wounded five in the central Al-Jhumuriyah district,
the official added.


Insurgents continue to stage daily lethal bombings in Baghdad,
more than two months after Iraqi and US forces launched a massive
security crackdown designed to quell daily bloodshed.
