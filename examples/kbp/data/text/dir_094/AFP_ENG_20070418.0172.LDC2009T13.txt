National flag carrier Philippine Airlines will take delivery of
seven Airbus aircraft this year, the company president said
Wednesday.


Four Airbus 320 planes purchased by PAL will arrive in April and
May while three A319 planes will be leased from the Airbus Co.
and will arrive by November, PAL president Jaime Bautista said.


"These new aircraft will boost our domestic and regional
operations," he told reporters without specifying the routes.


Bautista said the airline had allocated 250 million dollars for
the purchase of the four aircraft.


PAL last year said it would embark on an 840 million-dollar
aircraft upgrade programme with the acquisition of four new
Airbus A-319s and six A-320s.
