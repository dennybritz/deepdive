The Zimbabwean opposition is trying to create a state of anarchy,
veteran President Robert Mugabe said in an independence day
speech on Wednesday.


"We have observed how of late this conspiracy has attempted to
transform into a militant, criminal strain, characterised by the
puerile attempts of misguided opposition elements to create a
state of anarchy," Mugabe said in a keynote speech at a Harare
football stadium.


"As government, our message remains clear: that we will never
hesitate to deal firmly with those elements who are bent on
fomenting anarchy and criminal activities," added the 83-year-old
who has been in power since the former Rhodesia gained
independence from Britain on April 18, 1980.
