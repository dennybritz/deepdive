Iran on Wednesday said that it had seized four million litres of
illicit booze during the last Iranian year, ending March 2007,
the ISNA news agency reported.


"Last year we seized four million litres of alcohol. It is very
shocking, and this is only 25 to 30 percent of what is
distributed in the country," police commander General Esmaeel
Ahmadi-Moghadam said.


Only recognised Christian minorities in Iran, such as the
Armenians, are allowed to produce and consume alcohol, discreetly
and behind closed doors so as not to offend Islamic
sensibilities.


Production, sale or consumption of alcohol are otherwise
punishable by jail or the lash, although this has not stopped
significant smuggling from neighbouring countries.


Earlier this month, 12 people died after drinking homemade hooch
in a holy city of Qom in Iran and another 100 became sick.


Most of the alcohol that comes to Iran comes over its western
border from Iraqi Kurdistan.
