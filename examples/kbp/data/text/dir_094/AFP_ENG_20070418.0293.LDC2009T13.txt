Malaysian police in this mainly Muslim nation said Wednesday they
had charged a scantily-clad woman who was dancing on table tops
in a food court to attract customers.


Police also charged the owner of the food court in the town of
Kluang, in southern Johor state, as well as the disc jockey
providing the music for the event.


"We charged them for operating at an outlet without an
entertainment licence and the lady was charged for indecent
behaviour," said Kluang district police chief, Mohamed Fawzi
Arshad.


"She was wearing very short pants, hot pants, and her top was
normal for a woman who is trying to attract men," he told AFP,
saying the charges were filed on Monday.


Mohamed Fawzi said the police had received calls from outraged
customers at the food court and had sent plainclothes police, who
arrested the three during a performance last Thursday.


The New Straits Times Tuesday published a photo of a dancer in a
black bikini gyrating in front of a large crowd at the food
court.


The police chief said the owner of the food court had said
business was bad and he was just trying to lure customers.


Public displays of sexuality are rare in the conservative mainly
Muslim country.
