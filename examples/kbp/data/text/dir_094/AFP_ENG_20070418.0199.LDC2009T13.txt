Spain's Football Federation has been asked to investigate
comments by Real Madrid sports director Predrag Mijatovic and
Valencia coach Quique Sanchez Flores that appeared to question
the impartiality of referees.


The federation's referees' committee has sent transcripts of the
statements made by the two to its competitions committee, the
federation said on its Web site.


Speaking to reporters after Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat by Racing
Santander on Saturday, Mijatovic criticized the refereeing,
saying "some very strange things have happened".


"It isn't normal what they have done to us," he said.


The referee in charge of the match, Javier Turienzo Alvarez, said
Tuesday he had received over 50 telephone death threats after the
match and now feared for his family's safety.


Alvarez angered Real fans when he awarded Santander two penalties
in the last 20 minutes of Saturday's match and sent off two Real
Madrid defenders, Ivan Helguera and Alvaro Mejia, in the 87th and
90th minutes respectively.


Valencia coach Flores meanwhile blasted referee Manuel Gonzalez's
rejection of two penalty appeals after his side lost 1-0 to
Athletic Bilbao on April 7.
