German flag carrier Lufthansa is "in a position" to make major
acquisitions, but is looking to "keep a cool head", chief
executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber told shareholders at the annual
meeting here on Wednesday.


"We want to grow under our own steam, but would be in a position
for mergers like the one with Swiss," which Lufthansa acquired in
2005, Mayrhuber said.


Nevertheless, for that to happen, "an opportunity needs to arise
for both parties," he added.


"We won't lose our imagination, but one thing is clear: we'll
definitely keep a cool head."


Recently, speculation has reached fever pitch that Lufthansa
wants to buy Spanish airline Iberia.


And while Mayrhuber has repeatedly said that such a tie-up would
be attractive, the current asking price for Iberia would be too
high.
