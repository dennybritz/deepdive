Board members in Swiss companies are the best paid in Europe,
receiving almost twice as much in fees compared to their European
counterparts, a study by a consultancy firm showed on Wednesday.


Company directors in Switzerland received 140,000 euros (189,000
dollars) each on average in 2006 against an average of 72,000
euros in ten European countries surveyed, the corporate
consultancy Heidrick and Struggles said.


Switzerland also has a very high proportion -- 45 percent -- of
foreign executives on company boards, according to the study.
They include US nationals (27 percent), Germans (22 percent),
British (15 percent) and French (11 percent).


About 18 percent of company directors in European countries are
non-nationals.


Women fare even worse on Swiss company boards than in the rest of
the continent. Just 7.2 percent of board seats are occupied by
women compared to 8.4 percent for Europe.


The study was based on a survey of 294 major companies in 10
countries.
