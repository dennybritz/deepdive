The death toll from last month's blast in Siberia climbed to 110
as two more bodies were discovered in the wreckage, the mine's
owner said Wednesday.


The bodies were discovered overnight and identified, almost a
month after the March 19 accident at the Ulyanovskaya mine in
Kemerovo province, Interfax news agency said, quoting a spokesman
for the owner, Yuzhkuzbassugol.


The accident was the worst in Russia in the post-Soviet era.


Funerals for the two will take place on Thursday.


On Tuesday an official inquiry said that the explosion has
happened because someone had tampered with a safety system
designed to cut off the electricity supply if dangerous levels of
methane were detected.


Kemerovo governor Aman Tuleyev described the accident as a
"conscious crime committed with the aim of increasing coal
production".


Yuzhkuzbassugol is owned by the Evraz metals giant in which the
billionaire Roman Abramovich holds a 41-percent stake.
