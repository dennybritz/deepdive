East Timor Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta and a former guerrilla
fighter will contest a runoff vote in the nation's presidential
election, final results from the poll confirmed Wednesday.


The ruling Fretilin party's Francisco "Lu-Olo" Guterres won 27.89
percent or 112,666 votes in the closely fought April 9 race, the
country's first presidential poll since its independence in 2002.


Nobel Peace laureate Ramos-Horta took 21.81 percent or 88,102
votes, according to results released by the National Election
Commission (CNE).


The results are final pending a 24-hour window for candidates to
appeal, CNE chairman Faustino Cardoso told reporters.


The two leading candidates did not garner 50 percent of the vote,
leaving Guterres and Ramos-Horta to contest the runoff on May 8.


"Participation rate was 81.79 percent from 705 polling stations
all over East Timor," said Cardoso, releasing the figures.


"We give 24 hours to the public to claim their case to the appeal
court. If there are no objections after that period, CNE will
verify the results to the appeal court," he said.


Opposition Democrat Party chairman Fernando "Lasama" de Araujo
was third with 19.18 percent and a total of 77,459 votes.


Voter turnout was high and Timorese are hoping the election
stalemate will not plunge the impoverished nation into more
turmoil and bloodshed.


Confusion and irregularities with the poll count had threatened
to undermine the election's credibility, and had prompted some of
the eight candidates to demand a recount.
