Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Wednesday there were
limits to what Israel would give in return for a soldier seized
by Palestinian militants last summer.


"Israel cannot pay any (exorbitant) price to secure the release
of Gilad Shalit. We can't say that everything is possible and
permitted," army radio quoted Olmert as telling parliament's
foreign affairs and defence committee.


Shalit was seized last June 25 after Palestinian militants,
including members of the armed wing of Hamas, tunnelled out of
Gaza and attacked an army border post.


Egypt has been mediating drawn-out talks between Israel and the
Palestinians over a possible Palestinian prisoner release in
return for Shalit.


Last week it handed Israel a list of some 450 prisoners that the
Palestinians want freed in exchange for Shalit, but Israel
expressed reservations because it contained the names of those
involved in attacks that killed Israelis.


The Jewish state has thus far refused to free any prisoners "with
blood on their hands."


The fate of Shalit has been a major stumbling block in relations
between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
