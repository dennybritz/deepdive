A man believed to be planning a bomb attack was killed when the
device exploded prematurely in southern Cotabato after senatorial
candidates visited the city, police said Wednesday.


The improvised bomb went off while the victim was riding the
motorcycle, killing him, said police senior superintendent
Paniares Adap.


The dead man was believed to be carrying the bomb to an
undisclosed location but it went off prematurely, said Adap. He
would not speculate on what the bomber's target was.


The incident came hours after senatorial candidates of President
Gloria Arroyo's Team Unity (TU) visited Cotabato City to meet
with local officials at the city hall.


However police would not say if the attempted bombing was related
to the visit of the candidates, who had already left Cotabato
when the explosion took place.


Police said they had no intelligence information about any bomb
plot.


The motorcycle and the dead body were in too many pieces to be
immediately identified, they added.


This city has seen other bombing incidents blamed on Muslim
extremists in previous years. In the last incident in January,
two people were killed in Cotabato amid a series of bombings of
various cities in the southern Philippines.
