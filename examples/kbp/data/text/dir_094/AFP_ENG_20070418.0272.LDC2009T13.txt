Shares in French banking group Societe Generale hit record high
points on Wednesday on rumours than Italian bank Unicredito is
planning a takeover bid.


In late-morning trade the shares had climbed 5.05 percent percent
to 146.30 euros, after earlier hitting a peak of 146.45 percent
on an overall market which was only slightly percent lower at
0.05 percent.


"The shares are profiting from manoeuvres around ABN Amro but
mainly rumours around Unicredito which is interested in the
dossier," Guillaume Garabedian, a manager at Meeschaert asset
management said.
