A Beijing court has thrown out a case against a woman arrested
for organising nude online chatting because China's pornography
laws do not mention chat rooms, state media reported on
Wednesday.


The 36-year-old, identified by Xinhua news agency only by her
surnamed Li, was arrested three years ago on pornography charges
after taking off her clothes and chatting with other Internet
users via webcam, the agency said.


Li, who also organised chat rooms for other nudists, has said she
was "seeking excitement", Xinhua said.


However, prosecutors subsequently determined they were in a legal
"blind spot" as online chat rooms are not defined in pornography
laws.


New laws introduced since her arrest also failed to address the
issue, it said.


"Under the existing laws, it is inappropriate to treat this as a
criminal offence," Li Kai, a prosecutor in western Beijing's
Shijinshan district, was quoted as saying.


He added that his office could not prove that Li had committed
the criminal act of disseminating pornographic materials.


Members of China's rubber-stamp lawmaking bodies are routinely
criticised for having little knowledge of the complex issues they
are charged with legislating.


Authorities plan to stage a major crackdown on cyber-porn, which
is booming in China, Xinhua reported last week.


Ten government departments will spend the next six months
removing pornography from the Web as part of the campaign.


Online pornography is already illegal and China takes great
efforts to ban offending sites, but cyber-sex remains widely
available to anyone who wants to search hard enough.
