US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates arrived in Israel on
Wednesday on the third leg of a Middle East tour aimed at
countering Iran's influence in the region and shoring up support
for Iraq.


Gates is to meet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defence Minister
Amir Peretz, US officials said.


The trip, which follows stopovers in Jordan and Egypt, is also
aimed at reinvigorating the Palestinian-Israeli peace process --
a top agenda issue in the US official's talks with Jordan's King
Abdullah II and with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.


The visit is the first to Israel by a US defence secretary since
William Cohen in November 2000.
