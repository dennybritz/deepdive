Taliban militants fought a day-long battle with anti-narcotics
police near the main US base in Afghanistan, leaving four
militants and a policeman dead, officials said Wednesday.


Another five police were wounded in the fighting which erupted
late Tuesday and continued on Wednesday at Tagab, a village in
Kapisa province just northeast of the capital Kabul, a provincial
official said.


It began when rebels attacked a police unit which went to the
village to eradicate poppy fields under a government
counternarcotics programme, deputy provincial governor Sayed Daud
Hashimi said.


"Four Taliban and one policeman have been killed in the fighting.
It started on Tuesday and has continued until today," Hashimi
told AFP.


Tagab lies 25 kilometres (15 miles) north of Bagram Airfield,
which is the base for the 12,000-strong US-led coalition. A
separate force of around 37,000 NATO troops is also based in
Afghanistan.


The fundamentalist Taliban were ousted by US-led forces in 2001
but have since hit back with a bloody insurgency that has already
left around 1,000 people dead this year, most of them rebels.


A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report in March
highlighted "clear correlations" between the Taliban insurgency
and the drugs trade in Afghanistan, which accounts for 90 percent
of the world's heroin.
