China's first high-speed rail services got off to a slow start in
southern China on Wednesday when an engine breakdown halted rail
traffic in the area for five hours, state media reported.


A train travelling from the city of Guangzhou to nearby Shenzhen
suffered a "mechanical glitch" that delayed 32 trains, including
21 of China's new high- speed locomotives, Xinhua news agency
reported.


Guangzhou Railway Group officials declined to confirm whether the
broken down engine was one of the high-speed engines, it said.


The railways ministry told AFP it deployed 52 of the high-speed
trains, capable of speeds of up to 250 kilometres (155 miles) an
hour, for inaugural short- distance services around China on
Wednesday.


The trains are aimed at alleviating overcrowding on China's
extensive yet plodding rail system and put the country in an
exclusive club of nations such as Japan and the United States
that offer "bullet train" services.


By the end of the year, the ministry said 108 more trains will be
added.
