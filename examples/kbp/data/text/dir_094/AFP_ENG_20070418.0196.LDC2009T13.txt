German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger insisted on Wednesday he
will shake off his troublesome knee infection and play again for
his club Bayern Munich and his country again this season.


Even though there are only five games left this season, which
finishes on May 19, Schweinsteiger is desperate to help Bayern's
quest for a Champions League place and play in Germany's Euro
2008 qualifier against San Marino in June.


But the doctors have yet to tell the 22-year-old exactly what is
wrong with his problematic left knee which has kept him out of
action for two weeks.


"I want to play again this season," said Schweinsteiger.


"There are another five games left and I am sure that I can still
help Bayern get in the Champions League next season."


The results of tests on Schweinsteiger's knee are expected in a
few days, but for the time being the 43-times capped midfielder
is out of action.


"I can't do much at the moment, I can't jog or do any leg
exercises. I can't even do any upper body work. The doctor has
said I must rest."


Schweinsteiger is definitely out of Saturday's key Bundesliga
clash with VfB Stuttgart which with the winner taking pole-
position in the race for next season's third Champions League
place.
