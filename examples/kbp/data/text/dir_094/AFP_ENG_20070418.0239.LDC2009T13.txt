An Arab League delegation could arrive in Israel in the near
future to discuss the Arab peace initiative, Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert was quoted as saying by media on Wednesday.


Olmert was quoted as telling parliament's foreign affairs and
defence committee that such a delegation may visit the Jewish
state in the wake of Wednesday's meeting of the league's foreign
ministers in Cairo.


Twelve Arab foreign ministers were meeting in the Egyptian
capital to discuss a peace blueprint revived during a summit last
month in Riyadh.


The plan offers Israel peace and normal ties in exchange for a
withdrawal from Arab territory occupied in the 1967 war, allowing
the creation of a Palestinian state and a return of Palestinian
refugees.


Israel initially rejected the plan when it was first proposed in
2002, but on Sunday Olmert said that the Jewish state was ready
for talks over the blueprint.


Israel currently has full relations with only two Arab countries
-- Egypt and Jordan.
