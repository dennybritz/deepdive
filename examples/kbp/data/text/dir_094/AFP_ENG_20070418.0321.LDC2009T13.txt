The death toll from last month's coalmine blast in Siberia, the
worst in modern Russia, climbed to 110 Wednesday as two more
bodies were discovered, the mine's owner said Wednesday.


The bodies were found in the wreckage overnight and identified,
almost a month after the March 19 accident at the Ulyanovskaya
mine in Kemerovo province, Interfax news agency said, quoting a
spokesman for the owner, Yuzhkuzbassugol.


Funerals for the two will take place on Thursday.


On Tuesday an official inquiry said the explosion happened
because someone had tampered with a safety system designed to cut
off the electricity supply if dangerous levels of methane were
detected.


Kemerovo governor Aman Tuleyev described the accident as a
"conscious crime committed with the aim of increasing coal
production".


Yuzhkuzbassugol is owned by the Evraz metals giant in which the
billionaire Roman Abramovich holds a 41-percent stake.
