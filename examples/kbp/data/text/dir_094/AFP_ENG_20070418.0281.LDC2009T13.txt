A German nurse confessed on Wednesday to killing four patients
during her murder trial in which she is accused of killing six
people and attempting to murder two others.


Irene Becker, 54, said in a statement to the Berlin court that
she regretted giving the seriously ill patients lethal drug
overdoses but had wanted to spare them further suffering.


"I am sorry to have intervened in the destiny of people," she
said, and asked the families of her victims for forgiveness.


Becker did not refer to the other patients who died under
suspicious circumstances while in her care at Berlin's Charite
hospital, Europe's biggest university hospital. Most of the
victims were elderly.


She was arrested in October 2006 after a fellow nurse alerted a
doctor about the alarmingly high number of patients dying in
their ward.


State prosecutor Thorsten Neudeck said the nurse believed that
she had the right to decide over life and death.


In 2006, a male nurse was sentenced to life in prison in Germany
for administering lethal injections to 28 mostly elderly
patients.
