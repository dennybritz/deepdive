Arab foreign ministers on Wednesday mulled the formation of a
contact group to raise awareness among Israelis about a recently-
revived Arab peace initiative, said a high ranking official.


"One of the proposals submitted to the meeting is the creation of
an Arab team composed of the states that have official diplomatic
ties with Israel... to make contact with Israeli parties," a
diplomat who attended the closed-doors meeting told AFP on
condition of anonymity.


The group would be composed of Egyptians, Jordanians and
Palestinians and would seek to explain the 2002 Arab peace
initiative to Israel's political parties, government, unions and
intellectuals, he added.


Foreign ministers from a dozen Arab countries met Wednesday at
the Arab League to discuss how to reactivate their 2002 peace
proposal, which Israel originally rejected out of hand, but has
since expressed more interest in.


The Arab plan promises normalised relations in exchange for Arab
land captured in 1967, the creation of a Palestinian state and
the return of refugees.


Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Wednesday also told the
Israeli Knesset that an Arab League delegation could soon visit
Israel to discuss the initiative.
