A car bomb near a central Baghdad market killed 82 people
Wednesday, a defence ministry official said, bringing to at least
127 the death toll from a spate of bombings in the capital.


The explosives-rigged car blew up in the Al-Sadriyah district,
home to a mixed Kurdish and Shiite population.


The defence ministry official said another 94 people were
wounded, with women and children among the casualties.


Another security official put the death toll at 75 with 105
wounded, although a medic at the capital's Al-Kindi hospital said
doctors there had received 69 bodies alone.


Markets are a frequent target for bombings by Sunni extremists
bent on slaughtering Shiites, the majority community in Iraq
which now heads the government and dominates the security forces.


The bombings have continued despite a massive security crackdown
launched more than two months ago that has seen tens of thousands
of Iraqi and US troops patrolling the capital's streets.
