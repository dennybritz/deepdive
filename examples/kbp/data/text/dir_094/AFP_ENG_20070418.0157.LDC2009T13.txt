A string of bombings killed at least 10 people in Baghdad on
Wednesday, a security official said, in the latest defiance of a
massive Iraqi-US security crackdown in the war-torn capital.


A suicide bomber blew up his car targeting a police patrol in
Baghdad's western Uwairej area, killing four policemen and
wounding six civilians, a security official in the defence
ministry said.


Another car bombing ripped through a main road near a private
hospital, killing three civilians and wounding seven others, in
the central Karrada district, formerly upmarket but fallen on
hard times during the war.


In another attack, a bomb hidden in a parked car killed three
civilians and wounded five in the central Al-Jhumuriyah district,
the official added.


Insurgents continue to stage daily lethal bombings in Baghdad,
more than two months after Iraqi and US forces launched a massive
security crackdown designed to quell daily bloodshed.
