Chinese President Hu Jintao offered his condolences to the United
States on Wednesday in the aftermath of the shooting rampage that
took 33 lives at an American college.


"On behalf of the Chinese government, its people and myself, I
extend my sympathies and sincere condolences to your excellency
(US President George W. Bush), the American government and its
people at this difficult hour and express my grief for the
victims and wish the injured an early recovery," Hu said in a
brief statement.


Hu said he was "shocked by the tragic massacre" at Virginia Tech
University, according to the statement released by the foreign
ministry.


The incident on Monday was the worst shooting in US history.


Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing had conveyed his condolences
in a message to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Tuesday.


The gunman was identified as Cho Seung-Hui, 23, an English
student originally from South Korea and known by his peers as a
loner who exhibited strange and anti-social behavior. Cho took
his own life in the shooting.


Foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao on Wednesday criticised
"irresponsible" early US media reports which said a student from
China may have been the shooter, in remarks quoted by state-run
Xinhua news agency.


Liu said it was "terribly wrong" to issue such reports before the
truth was known, and that the reports violated press principles.
