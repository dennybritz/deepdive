Croatian officials expressed shock Wednesday after European
football's governing body UEFA chose rivals Poland and Ukraine
ahead of its joint bid with Hungary to host the Euro 2012
championships.


"I am shocked! Not surprised, but shocked," Croatian football
association chief Vlatko Markovic was quoted as telling Croatian
journalists in Cardiff, where the decision was earlier announced.


"Two days ago, a UEFA commission for national teams said the
Poland-Ukraine candidacy was inadequate, so I don't know what has
happened within the past 48 hours."


"In the future, small countries should ask themselves whether it
is worth competing with those who have 100 to 120 million
inhabitants," Markovic stressed.


Miroslav Blazevic, who coached Croatia to third place at the 1998
World Cup in France, echoed his views.


"I'm shocked, saddened. Our candidacy was impeccable and I was
convinced that we would have been chosen to host" the event,
Blazevic said.


Another former coach of Croatia, Otto Baric, said the decision
was disappointing.


"I was convinced that we could get this and that if we lost out
that it would be to Italy," said Baric, who led the national team
in 2002-2004.


The UEFA decision was a major shock as world champions Italy had
been hot favorites, while the rank outsider was the bid by Poland
and Ukraine, neither of them having hosted a major football
competition in the past.
