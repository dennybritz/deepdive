At least 18 Egyptian students were killed in a head-on collision
between two trucks south of Cairo while on their way to school on
Wednesday, police said.


Another eight students, all between 15 and 16 years old, were
injured in the early morning accident that took place on the
desert highway between Cairo and the southern city of Assiut.


According to the interior ministry, a truck carrying sand swerved
into the oncoming lane to pass another car and then struck a
pickup truck carrying the students.


About 6,000 people die and 30,000 are injured in road accidents
each year in Egypt. The transport ministry says they are the
second-highest cause of death in the country and experts estimate
they cause annual losses of up to 350 million dollars.


Traffic regulations are often badly enforced while maintenance of
vehicles is also poor. Many of the country's coastal and desert
roads allow for high speeds and accidents caused by reckless
overtaking are frequent.
