Bordeaux are set to make a second attempt to lure Norwegian coach
Trond Sollied to the French first division club, Norwegian daily
VG reported on Wednesday.


Bordeaux currently sit seventh in the French top flight and
currrent manager Ricardo has come under fire as the prospect of
another season out of European competition beckons.


VG did not reveal their sources but reported: "Sollied is a very
'hot' candidate to take charge of the French team this summer."


Bordeaux approached Sollied two years ago but were turned down by
the Norwegian, who instead joined Olympiakos before being fired
by the Greek first division side in December 2006.
