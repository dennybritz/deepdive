A moderate earthquake struck northern California early Wednesday
morning, the official United States Geological Survey said.


The quake, measuring five on the open-ended Moment Magnitude
scale, hit at 0842 GMT near Lake Pillsbury, at a point about 170
kilometers (100 miles) northwest of the state capital Sacramento.


The Moment Magnitude scale measures the area of the fault that
ruptured and the total energy released.
