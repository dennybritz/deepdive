An eastern German town is set to build a Chinatown complete with
apartments, hotels and shops, which it hopes will became a
tourist attraction, a spokesman for the town said on Wednesday.


The development is planned for a disused airfield in Oranienburg
which lies 35 kilometres (22 miles) north of Berlin in the
predominantly rural state of Brandenburg in the former communist
East Germany.


The Chinatown would be home to 2,000 people and surrounded by an
ornamental wall.


The plans were passed by the town council's planning committee on
Tuesday and will go before the full council in May. If the plans
get final approval, construction work could begin in 2008, the
spokesman for the Oranienburg town authorities said.


The development would cost around 500 million euros (680 million
dollars).


Unlike in many European capitals, there is no Chinatown district
in Berlin.
