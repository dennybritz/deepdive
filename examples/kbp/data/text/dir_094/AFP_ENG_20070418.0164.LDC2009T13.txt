Japanese retail giant Aeon Co. said Wednesday that it would set
up a wholly- owned subsidiary in Beijing to manage its shopping
mall business in northern China.


Beijing Aeon will be set up in June with paid-in capital of 1.5
billion yen (12.6 million dollars) and some 600 workers.


The unit will open its first shopping mall in Beijing in 2008,
with a plan to open 50 outlets in northern China over the next
five years, the group said.


Another subsidiary, Aeon Stores Hong Kong, will continue to
manage Aeon's retail business in southern China, including Hong
Kong.
