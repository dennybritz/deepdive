Nigerian soldiers on Wednesday clashed with members of an Islamic
fundamentalist group that killed 12 police and a civilian the
previous day in the northern city of Kano.


"The insurgents were supposed to be dislodged from their enclave
this morning by a combined team of soldiers and police. They are
right now doing that," federal police spokesman Haz Iwendi told
AFP.


Iwendi could not confirm any casualities from the operation,
although at least one witness spoke of seeing the bodies of three
soldiers.


AFP saw some 500 residents fleeing the fighting.


"The entire place is under troops' bombardment. That is why we
have to flee," a resident told AFP.


Members of the Islamist group, comprised of men and women wearing
red turbans and scarves, attacked a suburban police post in broad
daylight on Tuesday, killing the station chief, his wife and 11
officers.


The attack came despite attempts by the authorities to step up
security following weekend violence across Nigeria that claimed
21 lives in the wake of regional elections.


Presidential elections are due to be held on Saturday.


The assailants briefly occupied the police station before
escaping into a nearby abandoned building.


Last Friday assailants shot and killed a radical Muslim cleric
and two of his followers in a mosque in a Kano suburb.
