Visiting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday expressed
"shock and regret" over the assassination of Nagasaki Mayor Iccho
Ito, whom he praised as a "champion of peace."


"Mayor Ito was a champion of peace, for a world where nuclear war
will never happen again," Ban told a news conference, noting
Ito's leadership role in a mayors' campaign to rid the world of
nuclear weapons by 2020.


The UN chief said he had "expressed (his) deepest condolences to
his family and friends and the citizens of Nagasaki and Japan."


Ito, a political independent who was running for re-election as
mauor, was an outspoken pacifist born a month after the atomic
bomb that devastated Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.
