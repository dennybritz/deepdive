A Japanese gang affiliate said Wednesday it was disbanding after
one of its members shot dead the Nagasaki mayor in a rare
assassination, police said.


A member of Suishinkei, an affiliate in this southern city of
Japan's largest crime syndicate, the Yamaguchi-gumi, on Tuesday
gunned down Mayor Iccho Ito after an apparent personal dispute.


Motohisa Mizuta, the local affiliate's leader, went in person to
a police station and handed a letter saying that Suishinkei was
disbanding, a senior police officer told reporters.


"Our organisation has caused trouble to society," the officer
quoted the letter as saying.


The Suishinkei, whose membership is estimated to be in the
dozens, is the Nagasaki affiliate of the Yamaguchi-gumi, which
has more than 40,000 rank and file across Japan.


The Japanese mafia, known as the "yakuza," have interests in the
underworld including show business.
