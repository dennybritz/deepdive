Poland and Ukraine were chosen in a shock vote by European
football's governing body UEFA on Wednesday to jointly host the
Euro 2012 championships.


They won the fight to host the quadrennial tournament involving
the continent's top nations ahead of Italy and another joint bid
from Hungary/Croatia.


Next year's Euro 2008 finals will be joinly held by Austria and
Switzerland.


It will be the first time that either Poland or Ukraine have
hosted a major football championship.


The decision, announced by new UEFA president Michel Platini, was
a huge shock as world champions Italy had been hot favourites,
while the Polish/Ukraine bid was the rank outsider.


The Italians had been calling for a fresh start following
concerns over the match-fixing scandal that rocked their domestic
football last year and the crowd violence that halted all play
earlier this year.


The quadrennial tournament was jointly hosted by Belgium and the
Netherlands in 2000 and will be shared between Austria and
Switzerland next year, but organisational problems were raised in
the cases of Poland/Ukraine and Hungary/Croatia.


But UEFA officials pushed these concerns aside and instead
grabbed the chance to award the finals to former Eastern Bloc
countries for the first time since Yugoslavia hosted the 1976
finals.


The 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite UEFA
examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries.


Greece are the current European champions having won the title in
Lisbon in 2004.
