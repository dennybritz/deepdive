Three people were killed in an attack on a publishing house in
the eastern Turkish city of Malatya that published books on
Christianity, officials and media reports said.


An aide to the Malatya governor confirmed to AFP that three
people were killed, adding that the publishing house "was engaged
in missionary activities."


"We do not know the details, but we heard they were killed with a
knife," he said.


Two men were seriously injured -- one who jumped from the third-
storey office and a second whose throat was slit, the chief
physician of the hospital where they were taken, Murat Cem Miman,
told the NTV news channel.


"They are in serious condition," he said.


NTV said two of the dead, both men, were employees at the Zirve
publishing house. The company had earlier received threats for
printing books on Christianity, it said.


The Anatolia news agency said police were questioning four
people, but it was not immediately clear whether they were
suspects or witnesses.


The Malatya police chief and a prosecutor were investigating at
the scene.
