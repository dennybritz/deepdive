Iran on Wednesday refused to rule out using oil as a weapon if
the standoff with the West over its nuclear programme
intensifies, saying that the Islamic Republic would use every
means if attacked.


"The Islamic Republic of Iran's policy is to supply energy as a
responsibility. We are never seeking to cut the energy supplies
to the world," Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh told an oil
conference in Tehran.


"But naturally every country, which is subject to danger or
attack, should use all its possibilities to defend itself and
this is every country's right," he said.


His comments came in response to a question over whether Iran
would use oil as a weapon if the UN Security Council passed a
third resolution imposing more sanctions against Tehran over the
atomic drive.
