The military chiefs of Burundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of
Congo and Uganda met in Bujumbura Wednesday to agree a joint
military strategy against rebels in the volatile Great Lakes
region.


The document being considered by the commanders, a copy of which
was obtained by AFP, calls for joint operations against the rebel
groups in the region.


And it adds: "It will be imperative to carry out a series of
substantial offensives."


The aim was to create a common command that might even involve
joint operations against the armed groups, Burundi Defence
Minister Fermain Niyoyankana told reporters.


The meeting is expected to run into the evening.


"These propositions are important. We could all attack the
negative forces based in the east of the Democratic Republic of
Congo," a Burundi officer, who requested anonymity, told AFP.


Africa's Great Lakes region has been wracked by violence since
the early 1990s, with the civil war that began in Burundi in
1993; the Rwandan genocide in 1994; and the regional war that
raged in the DRC between 1998 and 2003.
