Rwanda has filed a complaint with the UN's highest court over a
French judge issuing arrest warrants against associates of
President Paul Kagame, Rwandan officials told AFP Wednesday.


In the documents filed with the International Court of Justice,
Rwanda says the arrest warrants "violate its sovereignty and
curtail its capacity to function freely and normally as a
sovereign state" and "set a dangerous precedent".
