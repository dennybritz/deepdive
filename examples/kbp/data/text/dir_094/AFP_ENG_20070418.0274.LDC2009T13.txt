A car bomb ripped through Baghdad's Shiite slum of Sadr City on
Wednesday and killed 10 people, security officials said.


Another 15 people were wounded when the vehicle exploded near a
main square inside the district, officials said.


The crowded district has long been infamous as a bastion of
militia faithful to radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and has
frequently been targeted by car bombings blamed on Sunni
extremists.
