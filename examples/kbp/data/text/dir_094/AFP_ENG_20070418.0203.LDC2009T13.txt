Some 89 Spanish shareholders in the French construction group
Eiffage were stripped of their voting rights at Wednesday's
general assembly, amid a dispute over management control and a
possible takeover.


The shareholders concerned are alleged to have clubbed together
to help Spanish construction group Sacyr Vallehermoso in its bid
for five seats on the management board.


Sacyr Vallehermoso has bought a 33.2-percent stake in Eiffage and
its demand for seats on the management board has sparked concern
in France about a foreign takeover of one of the country's
biggest construction groups.


Sacyr is the biggest shareholder in Eiffage. Several Spanish
groups have recently snapped up Eiffage shares.


Following the decision by French shareholders to deprive some
Spanish shareholders of their voting rights, representatives of
Sacyr walked out of the general assembly but returned later to
exercise their own rights.
