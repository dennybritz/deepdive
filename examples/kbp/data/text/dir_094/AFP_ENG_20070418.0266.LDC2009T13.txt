Nearly a third of Irish babies are now born to unmarried mothers,
according to official figures published Wednesday.


The Central Statistics Office (CSO) reported that 32.7 percent of
births in the third quarter of 2006 involved single mothers in
the predominantly Roman Catholic country.


That was substantially higher than the 26 percent figure recorded
for the same period in 1997.


The highest percentage of births outside marriage was in the city
of Limerick in the southwest, where 59 percent of babies were
born to single mothers.


The youngest first-time mothers were also in Limerick, with an
average age of 24.6 years.


The figures also show women are waiting longer to have children.


The CSO said the average age of mothers having their first child
was 28.7.


"The average age at which women have their first child has risen
by well over a year in the last decade and by over three years in
the last three decades," the CSO said.
