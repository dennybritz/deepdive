A German nurse confessed on Wednesday to killing four patients as
she went on trial for the murder of six people and the attempted
murder of two others.


Irene Becker, 54, said in a statement to the Berlin court that
she regretted giving the seriously ill patients lethal drug
overdoses but had wanted to spare them further suffering.


"I am sorry to have intervened in the destiny of people," she
said, and asked the families of her victims for forgiveness.


"With hindsight I realise that what I did was wrong."


Becker did not refer to the other patients who died under
suspicious circumstances while in her care at Berlin's Charite
hospital, Europe's biggest university hospital. Most of the
victims were elderly.


She was arrested in October 2006 after a fellow nurse alerted a
doctor about the alarmingly high number of patients dying in
their ward.


State prosecutor Thorsten Neudeck said the nurse believed that
she had the right to decide over life and death.


Neudeck disputed Becker's claim that she had acted out of
sympathy for the patients.


He alleged that she gave a male patient a lethal injection in
2005 simply because she was angry that he would not calm down.


In another case, he told the court Becker gave a woman with a
weak heart a fatal dose of blood pressure medication while the
patient's husband was sitting by her bed.


If convicted, Becker could be sentenced to life in prison.


A male nurse was given a life sentence in Germany in 2006 for
administering lethal injections to 28 mostly elderly patients.
