WBA cruiserweight champion Virgil Hill challenged Germany's Henry
Maske on Wednesday to come out of retirement again and give him
the chance to avenge last month's unanimous points defeat.


Maske, 43, returned to the ring to beat American Hill, also 43,
over 12 rounds at Munich's Olympic Hall on March 31, ten years
after his last fight against the same opponent in the same venue
when he lost his IBF light heavyweight crown.


But Hill insists he only lost the non-title fight because of a
knee injury and with both boxers now claiming a win, the American
wants a third and decisive fight against the man nicknamed "The
Gentleman" to settle the score.


"Henry, let's just fight one more time, man to man," challenged
Hill in a press conference in Munich.


"I won once, and you have won once. So it's 1-1 and a third fight
would settle the matter."


It remains to be seen whether Maske will accept the challenge
having said he was bidding farewell to the boxing ring for the
last time after beating Hill - and his wife may have something to
say about another re-match.


After the fight, Maske revealed he had promised his wife never to
box again.
