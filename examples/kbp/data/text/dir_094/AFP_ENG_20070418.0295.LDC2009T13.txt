Thailand's top energy firm PTT said Wednesday it would buy local
gas stations run by Conoco Phillips, the third-largest US oil
company, for about 200 million dollars.


Under a deal worth more than seven billion baht (200 million
dollars), PTT would take over 147 gasoline stations in Thailand,
which are currently operated by Conoco Phillips, a senior Thai
company official said.


"The deal also includes the acquisition of convenience stores at
each gas station," said a PTT official who declined to be named.


PTT and the US firm are expected to hold a news conference on the
deal Thursday.


The deal came as foreign investors grew jittery over economic
policies of Thailand's military-backed government, which recently
announced a new business law that limits foreign ownership of
Thai firms.


The state-controlled petroleum giant controls some 30 percent of
the Thai oil market and its biggest shareholder is the Thai
finance ministry with a 52.48 percent stake. Shares in PTT fell
2.00 baht to close at 214.00 Wednesday.
