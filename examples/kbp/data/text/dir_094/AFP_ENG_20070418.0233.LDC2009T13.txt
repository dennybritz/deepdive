The head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jean-
Claude Juncker, warned financial markets on Wednesday against
excessive currency speculation as the euro hit new high points.


"The markets should not embark on one-way bets," said Juncker,
who is also Luxembourg's prime and finance minister, after the
shared European currency raced past 1.36 dollars for the first
time since December 2004.


Asked about the apparently resigned attitude of European
countries at a recent G7 meeting in Washington on exchange rates,
Juncker advised the markets not to interpret the final statement
in the wrong way.


"I don't think that we can only trust the G7 communique," he said
after a cabinet meeting. "There were also exchanges on the
sidelines."


Despite growing concern in Europe about the euro's strength,
finance chiefs from the seven richest countries stuck at their
meeting to their long-standing line on exchange rates, saying
that excessive volatility was "undesirable".
