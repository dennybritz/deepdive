Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche upgraded its earnings outlook
for 2007 on Wednesday as first-quarter sales rose 16 percent to
11.4 billion Swiss francs (9.5 billion dollars, 7.0 billion
euros).


"Roche began 2007 with an impressive growth far ahead of the
industry... based on the successful first three months we raise
the outlook for 2007 and expect core earnings per share to grow
above group sales," chairman Franz Humer said in a statement.


Roche said it expected both group and pharmaceutical sales to
grow at double- digit rates in local currencies over the course
of the year.


"We continue to strengthen our future growth potential through
targeted acquisitions, alliances and in-licensing deals," Humer
said.


Earlier this month Roche said it would buy US immunochemistry
company BioVeris for 600 million dollars, which it will integrate
in its Diagnostics division.
