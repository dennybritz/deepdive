The Pakistan Cricket Board has named a new three-member committee
to select a national team following the country's recent shock
exit from the World Cup, officials said Wednesday.


Former Test offspinner Salahuddin Ahmad was appointed as new
chief selector, with Shafqat Rana and Saleem Jafer, also former
Test players, both members of the committee.


PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf "in consultation with the ad-hoc
committee members has approved the new selection committee for a
tenure of two years," a board spokesman told the official
Associated Press of Pakistan news agency.


The final team for each match would be picked by a tour selection
committee comprising the team manager, coach, captain and vice
captain, he added.


Pakistan is struggling to recover from its World Cup debacle in
the Caribbean and the murder of its coach Bob Woolmer a day after
the country lost to minnows Ireland.


They are also looking for a replacement for captain Inzamam-ul-
Haq, who stood down after the fiasco. Vice-captain Younis Khan
has already turned down the top job.
