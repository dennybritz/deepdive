A flap over flammable Japanese toilets escalated Wednesday after
another major manufacturer revealed problems with its electric
bidets spewing smoke or catching fire.


INAX, the country's second biggest porcelain toilet maker,
reported eight such cases to the government and the industrial
association between 1985 and 2005, although only one was made
public, spokesman Kunitaka Fujita said.


No one was injured but the incidents could fuel consumer worries
about the increasingly popular household appliances in Japan.


TOTO Ltd., the world's top toilet maker, said Monday it would
provide free checks and repairs on 180,000 electric bidet-toilets
after a defect in their heating systems caused three units to
catch fire and 26 others to spew smoke.


INAX publicly announced only the first case which was attributed
to an electric leakage due to erosion to a circuit terminal
caused by urine, Fujita said.


The company recalled some 32,000 units of the same type to
correct the defective part, he said.


"But we could not attribute the other cases to specific parts or
specific causes," he added.


The TOTO "Washlet" and the INAX "Shower Toilet" jet water at the
push of a button located on the seat, or via a remote control,
and come in different models with air fresheners, seat heaters
and even dryers.
