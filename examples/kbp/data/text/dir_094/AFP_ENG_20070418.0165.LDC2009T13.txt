Hong Kong has lifted a ban on poultry imports from most parts of
Japan after health officials sounded the all-clear following
deadly bird flu outbreaks, the government said Wednesday.


"In view of the control measures taken by Japan and the fact that
there are no other cases of avian influenza reported, we decided
to resume processing of applications," said a spokesman for the
Centre for Food Safety.


But the ban remained on produce from Miyazaki and Okayama
prefectures after poultry farms there reported outbreaks of the
deadly H5N1 avian flu in January and February this year,
respectively.


"Restrictions are not lifted for Miyazaki and Okayama as we are
still monitoring the situation there," the spokesman said.


Hong Kong, which was the scene of the world's first reported
major bird flu outbreak among humans in 1997, imported some 1,800
tonnes of frozen poultry products from Japan from January to
September last year.
