Zimbabwe's cabinet has approved a proposal by the ruling party to
bring forward parliamentary elections and hold them at the same
time as next year's presidential ballot, state media reported
Wednesday.


The plan will see future presidential terms reduced from six to
five years and therefore automatically coincide with
parliamentary polls.


It was first put forward at a central committee meeting of
President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union
Patriotic-Front (ZANU-PF) last month.


The goverment-run Herald newspaper quoted Justice Minister
Patrick Chinamasa as saying that the changes would also see the
number of lawmakers increase from 150 to 210.


The proposal still needs the formal approval of MPs but that is
seen as a formality as ZANU-PF enjoys a large majority in
parliament.
