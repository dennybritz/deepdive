Spanish construction group Sacyr Vallehermoso failed on Wednesday
in its bid to get seats on the management board of French
construction group Eiffage.


The snub came after some 89 Spanish shareholders in Eiffage were
stripped of their voting rights at Wednesday's general assembly,
amid a dispute over management control and a possible takeover.


The shareholders concerned were alleged to have clubbed together
to help Sacyr in its bid for five seats on the management board.


Sacyr Vallehermoso has bought a 33.2-percent stake in Eiffage and
its demand for seats has sparked concern in France about a
foreign takeover of one of the country's biggest construction
groups.


Sacyr is the biggest shareholder in Eiffage. Several Spanish
groups have recently snapped up Eiffage shares.


Following the decision by French shareholders to deprive some
Spanish shareholders of their voting rights, representatives of
Sacyr walked out of the general assembly but returned later to
exercise their own rights.


Sacyr said it planned to take legal action to challenge the
validity of the general assembly.
