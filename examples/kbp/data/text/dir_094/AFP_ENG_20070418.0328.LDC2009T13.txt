Shoaib Malik will be named as Pakistan's new cricket captain in a
bid to give the team a new look after their dismal World Cup
exit, two senior Pakistan Cricket Board sources said Wednesday.


The board chose 25-year-old batsman Malik to succeed Inzamam-ul-
Haq over more established names like Mohammad Yousuf because they
wanted a fresh start, the sources told AFP.


"Shoaib Malik is going to be the new captain. There is a
consensus on his name, he is young and he is talented," one of
the senior sources said on condition of anonymity.


Malik's appointment is expected to be announced on Thursday.


"We hope he will lift the team's performance. We want to give a
new look to the national team and he is a good choice in that
respect," the source added.


Malik will be appointed "for more than a year so that he gives
stability to the team."


Malik emerged the favourite after Younis Khan, the current vice-
captain, turned down the job.
