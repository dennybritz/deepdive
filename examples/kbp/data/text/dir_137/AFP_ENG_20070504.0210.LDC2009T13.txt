French-Spanish tobacco group Altadis said on Friday that it had
received a preliminary 50-euro-per-share takeover offer from
private equity groups CVC and PAI Partners that values the firm
at 12.8 billion euros (17.4 billion US dollars).


The offer trumps a rival bid of 47 euros per share by British
cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco.


Altadis, the world's fifth-largest tobacco company, said in a
statement that its board would meet in the coming days to
evaluate the bid by CVC and PAI Partners.


The board has rejected the offer by Imperial Tobacco as too low.


Formed in 1999 through the merger of France's Seita and Spain's
Tabacalera, Altadis has more than 27,000 employees.
