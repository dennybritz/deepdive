Six people died on Friday after a blaze swept through country
cottages in the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, destroying 150
holiday homes, RIA Novosti news agency reported.


"Because of the dry, windy weather the fire spread quickly
through the dachas" and the fire took five hours to put out, a
local law enforcement official was quoted as saying.


The official said that 11 other major fires had broken out in the
central Siberian region in the past 24 hours, destroying a total
area of more than 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres).
