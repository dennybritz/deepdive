US employers added 88,000 jobs in April, the government said
Friday, a sign of weaker-than-expected economic activity as job
growth slowed to its weakest reading since November 2004.


The unemployment rate ticked up a notch to 4.5 percent from 4.4
percent a month earlier, the Labor Department said.


The slowdown in nonfarm payroll hiring, seen as one of the best
indicators of economic momentum, was notably worse than expected.
Most analysts had expected employers to add 100,000 new positions
last month.


Additionally, the job picture for recent months was also
downgraded as the government revised lower its estimate for March
job growth to show 177,000 new jobs were created instead of
180,000, and for February to 90,000 from 113,000.


The sharp slowdown in job growth was fairly widespread across the
job market, as manfacturing shed 19,000 jobs, and job losses in
the retail sector amounted to 26,000 posts.


The overall worse-than-expected snapshot on the nation's job
market comes amid a weakening of other economic gauges and days
before the Federal Reserve meets to review US interest rates.
