Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer has confirmed the
club's interest in signing Italian World Cup-winning striker Luca
Toni from Serie A side Fiorentina.


"He's a guarantee to score goals, he has character and always
helps the team; he's a special type of player," Beckenbauer was
quoted as saying in Friday's Gazzetta dello Sport.


"I really hope he comes."


Asked if Bayern had already agreed a deal with Fiorentina to sign
Toni, Beckenbauer said: "I don't know, I can only say that Bayern
needs new blood. All transfers are handled by (Karl-Heinz)
Rummenigge and (Uli) Hoeness."


Last weekend German magazine Sport-Bild reported that Toni had
already agreed to sign for Bayern at the end of the season in a
deal worth 18 million euros.


Having been part of Italy's 2006 World Cup squad, Toni scored two
goals in the quarter-finals win over the Ukraine. He also netted
both goals in Italy's 2-0 victory against Scotland in last
month's Euro 2008 qualifier.


Bayern, currently fourth in the Bundesliga, nine points off the
pace with three games left, have had an indifferent season and
coach Ottmar Hitzfeld has promised sweeping changes for the next
campaign.
