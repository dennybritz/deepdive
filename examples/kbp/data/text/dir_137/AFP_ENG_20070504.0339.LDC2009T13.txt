A 52-year-old Greek mother has given birth to her two grandsons,
after getting legal permission to be a surrogate mother for her
daughter, a doctor in Crete said Friday.


The woman, who was implanted with embryos from her daughter's
fertilised eggs by her son-in-law, gave birth to twin boys in
good health and weighing 2.5 kilos (5.5 pounds), the
gynaecologist, Charalambos Batakis, told journalists.


In July last year a Greek court gave permission for the woman to
carry out a surrogate birth because her daughter was unable to
carry a pregnancy to term due to health problems.


Greek law allows for surrogate mothers as long as the parties
concerned reach an agreement with no financial compensation.


In principle, the surrogate mother should not be more than 50
years old, but in this case, the court agreed to an exception.
