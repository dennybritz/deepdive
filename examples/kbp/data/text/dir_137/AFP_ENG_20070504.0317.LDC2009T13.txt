The Cuban coast guard shot and killed two suspected drug
traffickers, thought to be Bahamian nationals, and seized almost
600 kilograms (1,300 pounds) of marijuana from their boat,
authorities said Friday.


Another suspect was wounded as the alleged smugglers tried to
escape arrest in the waters off the eastern coast of Cuba on
Monday, according to a statement published by the state-run
Granma daily.


A fourth person was arrested. The Cubans rammed the boat after
the crew ignored orders to stop.


The statement said the coast guard crew shot back when the
suspected smugglers opened fire.


The alleged smugglers were believed to be Bahamian nationals, the
statement said.
