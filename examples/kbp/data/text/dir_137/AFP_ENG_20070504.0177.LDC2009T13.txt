Nokia Siemens Networks, the Finnish-German telecom networks
manufacturer, said Friday it would cut 9,000 jobs by 2010, or 15
percent of its workforce, including some 3,000 jobs in Germany.


Nokia and Siemens merged their telecoms equipment and network
activities in 2006. At the time, they said they would reduce by
10 to 15 percent their workforce, which then amounted to 60,000
people.


"Nokia Siemens Networks is confirming today that it expects its
adjustment to remain within that range, at approximately 9,000
employees, subject to required consultations with employee
representatives," it said.


The company is the world's third-largest telecoms equipment
manufacturer behind Sweden's Ericsson and French-US group
Alcatel-Lucent.
