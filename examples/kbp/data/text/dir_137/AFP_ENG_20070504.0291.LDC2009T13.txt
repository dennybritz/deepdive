The European Commission warned Friday that it would not support
Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organisation before the end
of the year unless Moscow shows it is ready to resolve
outstanding issues.


"We should make clear that the EU is ready to support early
conclusion of Russia's WTO accession but not at any price," said
the Commission's spokesman on trade affairs, Peter Power.


"We need real political commitment," he said.


"A small number of issues remain to be resolved," he went on,
listing export duties, railway fees and the compatibility of
Russian legislation on trade barriers among them.


Russia is the largest economy in the world that is not yet a WTO
member.


The United States had promised to help Russia complete its push
to enter the 150-country trade body before a crucial election
cycle opens at the end of the year, but US officials have said
Moscow is only making "slow progress".


Parliamentary elections are set for December followed by a
presidential election in March 2008, when President Vladimir
Putin is due to step down.


"Russia's WTO membership is both in Russia's and the EU's
interest," Power underlined, adding that he expected some of the
problems -- "mostly technical" -- to be addressed at an EU-Russia
summit in Samara on May 17-18.


His remarks came amid growing tensions over Moscow's attitude
toward Estonia and a ban on Polish foodstuffs, as well as its
threat to veto "supervised independence" for Kosovo and a tough
stance on energy supplies.
