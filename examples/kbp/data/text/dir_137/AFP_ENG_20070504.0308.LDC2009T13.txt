A NATO soldier was wounded and two Taliban militants killed
Friday when insurgents attacked a patrol in Afghanistan, the
force said.


The attack was in the southeastern province of Paktika, the NATO-
led International Security Assistance Force said. It does not
give details of its casualties until an announcement by the
nations involved.


There are about 37,000 troops from 37 nations in ISAF, which is
working besides a US-led coalition and Afghan security forces to
put down a Taliban insurgency that has grown steadily since the
militants were toppled from government in 2001.


A British soldier was killed and an Australian wounded in attacks
around the country Thursday, while Denmark suffered its first
combat loss in Afghanistan when a soldier died in a Copenhagen
hospital.


More than 40 foreign soldiers have been killed in action in
Afghanistan this year, most of them US nationals. Most of the
troops in Paktika are American.
