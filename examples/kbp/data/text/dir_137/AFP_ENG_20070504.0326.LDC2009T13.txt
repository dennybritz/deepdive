Thomson Corporation is in talks to buy British financial data and
news provider Reuters Group Plc, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported Friday, citing unnamed sources close to the companies.


However, the bid is not a reaction to a bid by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. for Dow Jones & Co., owner of The Wall Street
Journal in a rapidly consolidating media market, the Toronto-
based newspaper said.


"Thomson is a big thoughtful company that makes long-range plans
and doesn't do hostile deals," one source told the newspaper.
"Reuters is not an instant decision on Thomson's part."


Thomson sees a complementary fit with Reuters, a "hand-in-glove
opportunity," another source said. Both provide financial data
and news, and a merger would combine Thomson's strong presence in
the United States with Reuters' popularity in Britain and
continental Europe.


Jason Stewart, vice-president of public relations for Thomson
refused to comment, telling AFP: "Thomson does not comment on
rumors and speculation."
