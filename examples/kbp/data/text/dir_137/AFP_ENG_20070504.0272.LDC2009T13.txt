Fourteen people were killed and another 45 were injured in China
Friday when a truck smashed into a group waiting for a bus, state
media said.


Nine were killed instantly when the driver of the truck lost
control and ploughed into them, the Xinhua news agency reported.
Another five died on the way to hospital and the 45 injured were
receiving treatment.


The accident in Yunnan province, southwest China, occurred when a
heavy truck crashed into the back of the smaller truck, before
colliding with a minibus.


China's roads are among the most dangerous in the world. More
than 18,000 people were killed and 90,000 injured in road
accidents in the first quarter of 2007, according to official
figures.


In 2006, the figures showed around 245 people died on the roads
every day, although the World Health Organisation says the real
number could be twice that.


Last month, 26 people were killed and five injured when a bus
plunged off an overpass in southwest China.
