A powerful traditional chief in northern Malawi has been jailed
for nine years for growing and possessing marijuana, court and
police officials said Friday.


Wonderson Msowoya, 48, admitted the charges in a Rumphi district
court after being arrested last month following a tip-off by
villagers.


Police spokesman Victor Khamisi said 122 kilograms (268 pounds)
of the illegal drug were found in raids on the homes of Msowoya's
two wives.


Many poor Malawians have turned to the growing of marijuana in
the fertile hills of the north of the country.
