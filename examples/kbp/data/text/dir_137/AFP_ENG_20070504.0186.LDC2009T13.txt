Cycling chiefs on Friday agreed to a "sacred union" to fight
doping by stepping up random drugs tests in the run-up to the
Tour de France.


Most teams are also ready to drop riders while they are formally
implicated in the Spanish 'Operation Puerto' doping
investigation, said the president of the International Cycling
Union, Pat McQuaid, Tour de France chief Christian Prudhomme, and
Quick Step manager Patrick Lefevere, representing the teams.


Prudhomme said cycling must wipe out the notion that the sport
was rotten and dominated by doped riders "because it's not true".


"We can only break out of that if we are together, and the
presence of the three of us on this issue is precisely the proof
of a sacred union in the fight against doping," he added.


McQuaid said the two-pronged agreement, despite other diffrences
between teams, race organisers and cycling governing body, was a
defining moment for cycling.


"It's important for cycling," McQuaid told journalists.


"Cycling is suffering, suffering hard now, with all the affairs
going on with Puerto, with Ullrich and with (Ivan) Basso now...
We've got to get all these affairs behind us, we've got to get to
the end of Puerto."


Lefevere said most teams -- about 90 percent -- were ready not to
select about 50 riders formally implicated in the Puerto affair
but cautioned that there were legal issues involved.


"We will call on the teams to take their reponsibilities," he
said.


Random drugs tests, including out of competition, will be
increased in the run- up to the Tour de France and for the rest
of the year, McQuaid said.
