Mascalzone grinder and CEO Vincenzo Onorato joked Friday as the
sun came back out at the Louis Vuitton Cup that the icecreams
were on the Italians after they picked up their second
10,000-euro fine of the event.


Mascalzone initially thought the team had closed the gap on
Spain's Desafio, a key rival for a semi-final place, by winning
Wednesday's encounter.


Instead, they must replay the encounter after being found guilty
of illegal backstay tampering.


Only three days earlier the jury had dished out another
10,000-euro fine to Onorato's squad and ordered a respray for
inadvertently using a non-sanctioned type of paint.


Asked why he thought the new fine had been imposed in addition to
the provisional docking of the two points for beating Desafio,
Onorato smiled ruefully and told reporters: "Maybe it's pocket
money for the icecream!" for the Cup's organisers.
