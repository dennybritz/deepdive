Hundreds of teenage pro-Kremlin activists rallied outside the
European Union's Moscow headquarters on Friday to call on
Brussels to wake up to the "fascism growing in Estonia."


Around 300 members of the Nashi youth group waved banners calling
for the release of a fellow teenage activist arrested in Tallinn
for organising demonstrations against a decision to move a Soviet
war memorial.


"The EU and NATO watched our protests at the Estonian embassy
very carefully... but no one wants to know why a school kid is in
prison," Nashi head Vasily Yakemenko said in an angry speech.


"We won't let the EU forget... that today fascism is growing in
Estonia."


On Friday, Nashi ended a week-long protest outside the Estonian
embassy to protest Estonia's controversial decision to move the
World War II monument from central Tallinn to a military
cemetery.


Dozens of activists, many of whom had arrived straight from
school, wrote letters in support of Nashi member Mark Siryk, who
the organisation says is being held at a secret location in
Estonia.
