Spain will provide the European Union's border control agency
with more equipment to help it stem the flow of illegal
immigrants from Africa to the bloc, the Spanish government said
Friday.


Madrid will contribute eight reconnaissance ships, two
helicopters, six experts and other border surveillance equipment
to Frontex, Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la
Vega told reporters following a cabinet meeting.


Based in Warsaw, Frontex launched its patrols in August 2006. It
aims to stop migrants from arriving by boat on mainland Europe's
southern Mediterranean shores or on Spain's Canary Islands in the
Atlantic.


Last month the agency said EU countries had promised to increase
their support for its patrols by making available a total of 21
planes, 27 helicopters and 116 boats.


De la Vega did not say if the equipment which Spain intends to
provide Frontex was part of this tally that Frontex unveiled in
April.


Frontex patrols helped cut the number migrants arriving at Canary
Island beaches by boat by 60 percent in the first three months of
the year to 1,525 from 3,914 in the same period last year,
according to government figures.
