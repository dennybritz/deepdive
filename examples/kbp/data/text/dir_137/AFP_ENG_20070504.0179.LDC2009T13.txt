The number of job seekers in Spain fell 1.7 percent in April from
the previous month to stand at 2,023,124 people, the labour
ministry said Friday.


The fall in the number of jobseekers in April when compared to
the same month in 2005 was 2.5 percent, it added in a statement.


The labour ministry only publishes the total number of job
seekers on a monthly basis instead of on a quarterly basis.


Spain's jobless rate, as reported by the national statistics
institute, stood at 8.47 percent of the active workforce in the
first quarter of 2007, up from 8.3 percent in the last quarter of
2006.


The unemployment rate had stood at 9.07 percent in the first
quarter of 2006.


The government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
expects the jobless rate will fall below 8.0 percent by the end
of 2007.
