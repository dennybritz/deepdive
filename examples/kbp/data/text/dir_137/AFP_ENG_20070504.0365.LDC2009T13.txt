AC Milan have opted to wear their all-white strip for the
Champions League final against Liverpool in Athens on May 23, a
repeat of the 2005 final which the English Premiership side won
on penalties.


Milan were drawn as the home side for the final and could have
worn their famous red and black striped shirts.


But just as in the 2005 final, Milan have chosen their second
strip, allowing Liverpool to wear their traditional red kit.


Milan's white strip had proved lucky before they lost the
Istanbul final two years ago.


Before that the Serie A giants had won four European Cups wearing
white, in 1963, 1990, 1989 and 2003.


Liverpool were 3-0 down at half-time in the 2005 final but pegged
Milan back with three goals in a six-minute spell.


Extra-time failed to separate the two sides and Liverpool won the
shoot-out to lift the trophy.
