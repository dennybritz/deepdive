African magistrates meeting on Friday demanded better security
and working conditions, and complained of corruption and
cumbersome procedures that hinder their decisions.


Concluding a three-day symposium, representatives of the African
Group of the International Association of Judges (UIM) sought
"improvement in living and working conditions ...to ensure moral
and material independence of magistrates".


They also deplored "the obsolete material, the slow pace of
justice system, the high cost of procedures" and "difficulties of
executing court decisions."


The judiciary officials, drawn from over a dozen African
countries, denounced corruption and lack of adequate personnel in
their profession.


Citing an example of staff shortages in Africa, an Ivory Coast
judge Roger Yapi, said one magistrate in the country caters for
60,000 people, instead of the internationally recommended 15,000
inhabitants per magistrate.


The meeting brought together magistrates and experts from South
Africa, Cameroon, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Togo and
Tunisia.


Algeria, Benin, Gabon, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) sent in observers.


IUM is a professional and non-profit making international body of
national associations of judges, whose headquarters is in
Salzburg, Austria.
