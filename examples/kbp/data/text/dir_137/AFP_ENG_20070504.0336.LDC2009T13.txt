Turkey's prime minister met the head of the military on Friday,
the first such encounter since the influential army threatened to
intervene in national politics last week, an official said.


Recep Tayyip Erdogan received General Yasar Buyukanit in his
office in Istanbul, the prime minister's spokesman, Mehmet Akif
Beki, told AFP. He declined to give other details.


Last Friday the army, which has toppled four governments in as
many decades, issued a statement accusing Erdogan's government of
tolerating rising Islamist activity and threatening to act to
defend the country's secular identity.


The government responded equally harshly, calling the army to
order and saying that it is answerable to the civilian authority.


Erdogan and Buyukanit had spoken over the telephone a day after
the army statement, which was issued hours after Foreign Minister
Abdullah Gul narrowly missed being elected president in
parliament.


It was widely seen as a signal that Gul, a former Islamist, is
unwelcome as head of state by the generals.


The Constitutional Court Tuesday annulled the first-round
presidential vote on the grounds that quorum rules were violated.


The crisis prompted Erdogan to call snap general elections.
Parliament Thursday set the election date for July 22, more than
three months ahead of schedule.
