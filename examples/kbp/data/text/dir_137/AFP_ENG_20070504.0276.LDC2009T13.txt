Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych agreed Friday to hold early parliamentary elections,
signalling an end to a bitter power struggle in the ex-Soviet
republic.


"Today we reached agreement in principle on holding early
elections," Yushchenko said after meeting with Yanukovych in
Kiev, Interfax news agency reported.


Speaking to a crowd of several thousand of his supporters who
have rallied on Independence Square in central Kiev for weeks,
Yanukovych confirmed that a deal had been reached.


"We have reached the same conclusion that there is no other way
to resolve this crisis than to organise honest and democratic
elections," Yanukovych told his supporters.


There was no immediate indication of the date when elections
would be held.


Ukraine has been in crisis since Yushchenko issued an order on
April 2 to dissolve parliament and hold early elections after
months of dispute with his arch rival Yanukovych, who heads up a
pro-Russian coalition in the parliament.


Yanukovych defied the order and brought thousands of his
supporters into central Kiev, who held round-the-clock protests
against Yushchenko outside key government buildings.


The power struggle has paralysed political life in Ukraine and
led to heated debate in the country's constitutional court, which
Yanukovych supporters appealed to against Yushchenko's order.
