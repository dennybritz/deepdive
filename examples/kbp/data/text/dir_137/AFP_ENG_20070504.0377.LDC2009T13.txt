The Netherlands turned back a Palestinian minister with the
Islamist movement Hamas on Friday who was headed for a conference
on refugees, the minister said.


Speaking to Arab news channel Al-Jazeera from his plane, sports
and youth minister Bassem Naim said he was stopped at Brussels
airport where he was to have made a stopover and told his
Netherlands visa had been revoked.


Belgian police told him that the justice ministry in the
Netherlands had cancelled the entry visa on the grounds that he
was "dangerous for the security of the Dutch people", the
minister said.


Since the formation of a unity government in March between Hamas,
which is branded a terrorist group in the EU and United States,
and the mainstream Fatah party, some countries have restored
contacts but only with non-Hamas ministers.


In the West Bank political capital of Ramallah, information
minister Mustafa Barghouti said: "We are surprised by this
decision and we expect the Netherlands to take a balanced stand
between Israel and the Palestinians."
