Portuguese police were searching Friday for a missing British
three-year-old girl who disappeared in the Algarve while on
holiday with her parents.


A Portuguese police spokesman said they had no immediate idea why
the girl had disappeared, despite reports that her parents fear
she had been abducted.


The parents left the child in their hotel room along with two
other children to go out for dinner while staying at the Mark
Warner Ocean Summer Club near the village of Praia da Luz in the
Algarve on Thursday evening.


When they returned at around 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) they discovered
their daughter missing and the door of the hotel room and a
window open.


Britain's daily Guardian named the girl on its online version as
Madeline McCann, saying her parents Gerry and Katie -- from
Leicester in the English Midlands -- were dining in a tapas
restaurant near their rented apartment.


Gill Renwick, a family friend, told British television channel
GMTV that the distraught parents were certain that Madeline had
been abducted. "They were just watching the hotel room and going
back every half-hour."


"She's obviously been taken as she couldn't have gone out on her
own and the shutters had been forced open," she said, cited by
the Guardian online website.
