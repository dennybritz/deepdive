Iran's foreign minister walked out of dinner attended by
Condoleezza Rice claiming the dress of a Russian violinist who
was also present was inappropriate, US officials said Friday.


But the officials argued the incident which took place Thursday
night may have had more to do with Manouchehr Mottaki discovering
"with consternation" that he had been seated right opposite the
US secretary of state.


"I am not sure which woman he was afraid of: the woman in the red
dress or the secretary of state," said state department spokesman
Sean McCormack.


Iranian officials did not immediately comment on the incident.


The dinner was organised by Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul
Gheit on the sidelines of an international conference in the Red
Sea resort of Sharm el- Sheikh aimed at stabilising war-torn
Iraq.


On Thursday, Rice had a brief exchange with Mottaki at a foreign
ministers' lunch.


Speculation has mounted in recent days over possible talks
between Rice and her Iranian counterpart, in what would be the
highest-level bilateral discussions between the two countries
since they broke off ties in 1980.


Despite Thursday's brief encounter being void of political
substance, it was believed to reflect a new willingness on the
part of both Washington and Tehran to engage in some form of
dialogue.
