Switzerland will return to Kazakhstan some 84 million dollars (62
million euros) that were blocked in Swiss banks over a corruption
case involving a US businessman and Kazakh oil concessions, the
Swiss Foreign Ministry said Friday.


Following an agreement with the United States, Kazakhstan and the
World Bank, the money released by Switzerland will go to fund
projects for needy children in the former Soviet republic, the
ministry said.


The funds were blocked in Switzerland in 1999 following a request
by the United States for international judicial cooperation in
the case, the head of the ministry's directorate of international
law, Paul Seger, told AFP.


He did not specify the US businessman by name.


In 2004, US prosecutors charged oil consultant James Giffen with
passing bribes to Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev and
former Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev in the 1990s.


The US indictment against Giffen alleged that Nazarbayev and
Balgimbayev used money channelled through offshore, Swiss and
Liechtenstein-based accounts to pay for -- among other items --
fur coats, holidays, jewellery, housing and the education of one
of the president's daughters.


Under the agreement signed in Washington on Wednesday, the
humanitarian projects will be managed by an international non-
governmental organisation, the Swiss foreign ministry said.


Switzerland and the United States will retain a veto if they feel
the funds are not being properly used.
