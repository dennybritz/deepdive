An Italian mountaineer has fallen to his death in Nepal while
attempting to scale the world's seventh-highest peak, a tourism
official said Friday.


Sergio Dalla Longa, 40, died climbing the 8,167 metre (26,794
feet) Dhaulagiri on Sunday, tourism official Dhruba Sharma said.
Mountaineering websites reported he was close to the summit when
the accident occurred.


Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000 metres,
including the world's highest mountain, Everest.
