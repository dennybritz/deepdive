Russia and the United States have agreed to hold top-level
meetings in a bid to resolve an escalating dispute over US plans
to put anti-missile bases in eastern Europe, a senior US official
said Friday.


The meetings would involve foreign and defense ministers of both
countries, Assistant Secretary of State Dan Fried told reporters.


"We have agreed to a Russian suggestion that the secretaries of
defense and state meet with their Russian counterparts and do so
in a so-called 2+2" format," he said.


Fried said the first meeting was tentatively planned for around
September, though no dates had been set, and could be expanded to
include the two governments' national security advisers.
