Two municipal board candidates in the Sicilian town of Corleone
were arrested on Friday for suspected drug trafficking, Palermo
police said.


Eight suspects were detained in total in Corleone and Palermo as
part of an investigation into cocaine and hashish trafficking.


Corleone, the birthplace of major Mafia bosses who are now behind
bars or dead, is about 30 kilometres (19 miles) south of the
Scicilian capital Palermo.


Author Mario Puzo named the central crime family in his seminal
book "The Godfather" after the town.


The two arrested candidates are Leoluca Lanza, 25, of the
Christian-Democrats For Independence party, and Giovanni Riina,
32, from Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.


Those arrested were accused of being involved with a criminal
organisation with the aim of drug trafficking, Ansa news agency
reported.


Municipal elections are scheduled for May 13 and 14 in Corleone.


The village was the birthplace of Mafia bosses Luciano Leggio,
who died in 1993, Salvatore "Toto" Riina, arrested the same year,
and Bernardo Provenzano, who was arrested in April 2006 after 43
years on the run.


Last month, Palermo police chief Giuseppe Caruso told the daily
La Repubblica that "Corleone is no longer the stronghold of
godfathers."
