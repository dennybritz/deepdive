After Leeds United's near certain relegation to League One last
weekend, the club's Supporters Trust has claimed it is ready to
buy club.


Leeds will be relegated to the third tier of English football for
the first time in their history, barring the most unlikely turn
of events this weekend - which would see them needing to overturn
a goal difference disadvantage of nine to Hull City.


The club is in major financial difficulty but according to the
BBC the Supporter's Trust claims it has the funds to buy Leeds.


Leeds also face a possible 10-point penalty next season if they
enter administration, something that happened to Rotherham this
season and eventually saw them relegated to League Two.


It is only 15 years since Leeds last won the title, when Eric
Cantona was on their books, and only six years since they reached
the Champions League semi- finals.
