US employers added 88,000 jobs in April, the government said
Friday in a sign of weaker-than-expected economic activity.


The unemployment rate ticked up a notch to 4.5 percent from 4.4
percent a month earlier, the Labor Department said.


The slowdown in nonfarm payroll hiring, seen as one of the best
indicators of economic momentum, was notably worse than expected.
Most analysts had expected employers to add 100,000 new positions
last month.
