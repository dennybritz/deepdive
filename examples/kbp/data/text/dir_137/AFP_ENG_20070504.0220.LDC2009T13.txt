Pope Benedict XVI and visiting former Iranian president Mohammad
Khatami on Friday offered their support for the international
meeting in Egypt on security cooperation in war-torn Iraq.


"Concerning the situation in the Middle East, the need for strong
initiatives by the international community, such as that taking
place in Sharm el-Sheik (Egypt) was reaffirmed," a Vatican
statement said.


The two-day conference at the Red Sea resort, to wrap up later
Friday, is being attended by delegates from Iran, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, the United States, the European Union and the United
Nations.


The pope met privately with Khatami for about half an hour Friday
morning.
