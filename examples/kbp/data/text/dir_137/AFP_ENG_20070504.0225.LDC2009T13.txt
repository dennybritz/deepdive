German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel hailed the findings of
a UN climate conference on Friday as proof that it was not too
late to save the world from the effects of global warming.


"The report shows that climate catastrophe is not inevitable. We
can prevent it," Gabriel said in a statement after the UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released the third part
of its report in Bangkok.


"We have no time to lose. We must act decisively to avoid the
severe and ever more unmanageable consequences of climate
change," Gabriel said.


The German minister appealed for the increased use of technology
to increase energy efficiency and an expansion in the use of
biofuels.


He also said that negotiations in Bali in December to find a
successor to the Kyoto Protocol must be productive.


"It's important that we set the right course at the climate
conference in Bali. Science has done its work, now politics must
do its work."


Meanwhile, a high-ranking official in the German environment
ministry who attended the talks in Bangkok accused China of
impeding progress towards cutting greenhouse gases.


Michael Mueller said China's representatives had been "masters of
deception and the art of interpretation" during the negotiations.


China, he said, had dragged its feet over moves to blame coal as
a major contributor to global warming over recent years.


China relies largely on coal-fired power stations.


The IPCC concluded on Friday that nations have the money and
technology to save the world from the worst ravages of global
warming, but they must start acting immediately to succeed.


Gabriel said last month he wanted Germany, the biggest economy in
the eurozone, to become the world leader in energy efficiency.
