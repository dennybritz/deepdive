An official Jordanian delegation met Welfare Minister Isaac
Herzog on Friday to discuss efforts to revive the stalled Middle
East peace process amid growing political tensions in Israel.


The head of the delegation, former prime minister Abdel Salam al-
Majali, "arrived in Israel for talks on finding ways to push
forward the peace process and increase Jordan's role in it," an
Israeli official told AFP.


"Majali called on Israel to take brave steps and move towards a
diplomatic process with (Palestinian president) Mahmud Abbas
which would lead to a two- state solution," the official added.


Majali was a key player in the signing of the 1994 peace treaty
between Israel and Jordan, which has since been at the forefront
of mediation efforts between the Jewish state and the
Palestinians.


Herzog briefed the delegation on the political situation in
Israel in the wake of the crisis surrounding Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert and his cabinet following a scathing interim report on
last year's Lebanon war.


"Once the storm subsides Israel will have to formulate a starting
position for talks on final status talks with Palestinians," the
Labour party minister was quoted as saying.


Olmert has so far weathered calls to quit over the 34-day Lebanon
war, which a commission of inquiry report on Tuesday said was
marked by "serious failures."
