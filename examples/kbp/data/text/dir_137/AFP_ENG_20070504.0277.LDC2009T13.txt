A Czech soldier was killed and six others were injured when a
landslide crashed onto their convoy in northern Afghanistan, the
Czech Republic's defence ministry said Friday.


A violent storm caused the landfall that crashed onto a road
where the convoy of four vehicles, carrying 14 members of the
Czech military, was travelling in Faisabad late Thursday.


Mud completely buried the vehicle carrying the solider who died.
The defence ministry added that two of the soliders were
seriously injured.


The soldiers involved in the accident formed part of a battalion
based at Chrudim in the central Czech Republic.


The country has a military contingent of about 200 in
Afghanistan.
