Media rights groups have called on Nigeria's national assembly to
override a presidential veto and sign into law the Freedom of
Information Bill.


"We urge the National Assembly without further delay to override
the President's veto... that the law could come into existence
immediately", Media for Democracy (MDS) said in a statement to
mark World Press Freedom Day Thursday.


An umbrella body of Nigerian media rights groups, MFD noted that
the bill was passed by the national assembly in October 2006 and
criticised President Olusegun Obasanjo's failure since then to
sign it into law.


"No meaningful war can be waged against corruption where the
citizens are denied the right of access to information," MFD
said.


The media rights groups also said they were worried by attacks on
journalists and human rights activists in the period around
Nigeria's recent elections.


Reporters without Borders said that Dare Folorunso of the state-
owned radio- television station was beaten unconscious by several
policemen including a senior officer at a May 1 workers' rally in
the Ondo state capital Akure.
