A majority of Qantas shareholders appear to have rejected a
multi-billion dollar takeover bid, meaning it will not proceed,
the private equity consortium behind the offer said Friday.


The Airline Partners Australia (APA) consortium said it did not
believe it had the 50 percent acceptances it needed from
shareholders to meet a 0900GMT deadline to extend the bid.


"As at 7:00pm (Sydney time) on May 4, 2007, it appears that
acceptances have not reached the 50 percent level required to
extend the offer," APA said in a statement sent to AFP.


"If this is confirmed,  APA's offer for Qantas Airways Limited
will not proceed."
