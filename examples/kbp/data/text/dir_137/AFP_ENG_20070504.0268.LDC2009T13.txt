Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he had
agreed with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on early
parliamentary elections, after a weeks-long power struggle in the
ex-Soviet republic, Interfax news agency reported.


"Today we reached fundamental agreement on holding early
elections and on what needs to be done for these elections to
take place honestly and democratically," Yushchenko was quoted as
saying by Interfax after a meeting with Yanukovych.
