The head of Romanian public television, Tudor Giurgiu, handed in
his resignation Friday, denouncing what he called "pressures" on
him as well as fears about the independence of the station.


"I am afraid I can no longer guarantee the editorial independence
of TVR, which is at risk of not being able to fulfill its
mission," Giurgiu said in a letter.


Named to head the TVR by the ruling National Liberal Party of
Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu in 2005, Giurgiu, 35, said he has
been the target of a press campaign.


He said his one "fault" was in "hoping to change at any cost the
image of TVR," an institution once criticised for favouring the
Social Democrats, now in opposition.


Giurgiu has been criticised for poor management of TVR, which has
run up significant debt and lost to a private channel the rights
to broadcast national championship football matches.
