Spain's largest power producer, Endesa, posted Friday a
40-percent drop in first-quarter profits as a mild winter in
Europe led to lower energy consumption in its core market.


The company, the target of a takeover bid from Italy's Enel and
Spanish builder Acciona, said net profits fell to 633 million
euros (858 million US dollars) during the first three months of
2007 from 1.05 billion euros during the same time last year.


Analysts had forecast the company would post a net profit of
between 806 and 860 million euros.


In Spain and Portugal -- which accounts for over two-thirds of
Endesa's results -- the firm posted a first-quarter net profit of
437 million euros, a 23-percent decrease from the same year-ago
period.


In the rest of Europe, Endesa posted a net profit of 100 million
euros, a 15 percent decrease over the first-quarter of 2006.


The company said the decline was "mainly as a result of the
impact of weather conditions on market performance in Italy and
France."


Much of central and northern Europe has experienced milder-than-
average temperatures during the first three months of the year
leading consumers to forego the use of electric heaters.


In Latin America, Endesa said it recorded a net profit of 96
million euros, a 50.8-percent drop over the same time last year.


Enel and Acciona are offering 41.3 euros per share of Endesa in a
bid which values the company at 43.7 billion euros. The two firms
already jointly hold 46 percent of Endesa.


The offer follows a failed 40-euro bid by German power company
E.ON for the Spanish power firm.
