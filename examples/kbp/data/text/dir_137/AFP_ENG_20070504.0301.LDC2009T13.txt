Several people were hurt Friday when police fired shots and used
teargas and batons on Muslims protesting damage to a mosque in
Indian Kashmir, witnesses said.


Dozens of Muslim youths poured on to the streets near Srinagar's
main mosque and threw stones at police and paramilitary forces.


Police fired on the crowd and injured a civilian, while several
others were hurt in a baton charge, witnesses said.


The protesters said the mosque, in a historic fort used by
paramilitary forces, had been damaged and accused the
paramilitaries of neglect.


Muslim visitors said a Hindu and a Sikh temple inside the fort
overlooking Srinagar, capital of Indian Kashmir, remained intact.


The Authorities denied the allegations, saying the mosque had
been in a "dilapidated" state for a long time.


The Hari Parbat Fort, built in 1808 when Kashmir was under Afghan
rule, was thrown open last month, 17 years after the deadly
separatist insurgency launched by Muslim militants against New
Delhi forced it to close.


Authorities had feared the strategically-located building
overlooking Srinagar could be misused by the rebels, who have
carried out bombings, suicide attacks and shootings in the city.


The design of the fort, built by Afghan governor Atta Mohammed
Khan, is similar to those in Central Asia characterised by small
brick and stone work and it contains a series of small
apartments.


The fort's surrounding wall was constructed in the 16th century
by Mughal Emperor Akbar and the area served as an army
cantonment.
