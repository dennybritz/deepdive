Two US F-15 fighter jets made emergency landings Friday in the
Hungarian capital Budapest, airport spokesman Domokos Szollar
said.


"Two F-15 fighters were forced to make emergency landings on
Friday," Szollar told commercial news radio, InfoRadio.


"This is not an extraordinary event, this is an international and
a NATO airport so the military presence is not unusual," he
added.


Szollar said he did not know where the fighter jets were headed.


Hungary and the United States are both members of the NATO
military alliance.


Hungarian defence officials refused to comment on the incident.
