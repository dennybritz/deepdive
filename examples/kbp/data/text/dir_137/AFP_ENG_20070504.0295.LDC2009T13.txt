Germany's powerful IG Metall union said on Friday it had agreed a
4.1-percent pay rise for its 3.4 million members in Germany,
effective from June.


That would be followed by a further pay rise of 1.7 percent a
year later.


The deal was thrashed out during 20 hours of negotiations with
employers in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg but will be applied
across Germany.


Workers covered by the deal will also receive 400-euro payments
in April and May, before the new agreement comes into effect.


The negotiations sought to find an end to a dispute punctuated by
one-day strikes.


IG Metall had originally demanded a 6.5 percent rise, while
employers made an initial offer of 2.5 percent with a 0.5 percent
bonus.


The union hailed a good deal for its members. "A nice sum of
money will be going into the wallets of employees," said one of
its negotiators, Joerg Hofmann.


The employers admitted they had wanted to keep any deal under
four percent, but put on a brave face.


"It is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing
exceptionally well," said Stefan Roell, who represented Baden-
Wuerttemberg in the talks.


After years of gloom, the German government last month raised its
growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent, representing a clear
improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent.


Consumer sentiment and business confidence indices in the
eurozone's biggest economy have also shown sharp rises recently.


Economists have been closely watching the IG Metall negotiations,
with many fearful that handing out big pay rises could slam the
brakes on Germany's economic growth.
