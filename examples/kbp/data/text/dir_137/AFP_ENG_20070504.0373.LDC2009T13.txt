A group of 80 people rallied outside the Russian embassy in the
Lithuanian capital Vilnius Friday to show their support for
Estonia, which is locked in a row with Moscow triggered by the
removal of a Soviet war monument.


The protesters waved Lithuanian, Estonian and European Union
flags, and chanted "Hands off Estonia" and "Estonia, we are with
you".


Some held banners that read: "Russia has forgotten that Estonia
is an independent country".


The action was organized by the right-wing Young Conservative
League and Lithuanian Movement. More protest actions are planned
next week.


Estonia suffered the worst unrest since independence from the
Soviet Union in 1991 when riots broke out last week over a plan
to remove a monument to Red Army soldiers from central Tallinn
and place it in a military cemetery.


The monument was removed from the place where it has stood in
downtown Tallinn on Friday, after a first night of rioting in
which a young Russian national was stabbed to death.


AFter the statue was removed, two pro-Kremlin youth groups began
staging noisy protests outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow,
and on Wednesday tried to attack the Estonian ambassador.


The United States, several European Union members, NATO and the
European Commission have thrown their support behind Estonia in
the row.


Like Estonia, Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet
Union at the end of World War II. It regained independence in
1991 as the USSR disintegrated.
