Dozens of Portuguese police aided by dogs were searching Friday
for a missing British three-year-old girl who disappeared from
her hotel room in the Algarve while on holiday with her parents.


A senior police officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Costa Gabral, quoted
by the Lusa news agency, said Madeline McCann vanished while her
parents were out to dinner and could have been snatched.


Her parents, named by the British daily the Guardian as Gerry and
Katie, from Leicester in the English Midlands, said they had left
her asleep with her two- year-old twin brothers.


They had checked back regularly from the nearby restaurant, and
when they returned at around 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) they discovered
their daughter missing and the door of the room and a window
open.


Gill Renwick, a family friend, told British television channel
GMTV that the distraught parents were certain that Madeline had
been abducted. "They were just watching the hotel room and going
back every half-hour."


"She's obviously been taken as she couldn't have gone out on her
own and the shutters had been forced open," she said.
