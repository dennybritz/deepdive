Authorities in the most populous state in northern Nigeria have
made it compulsory for pupils in all schools in the state to
abide by an Islamic dress code.


"All private schools in the state are hereby directed to ensure
their ... pupils observe the dress code in accordance with the
tradition and beliefs of our people," Kano governor Ibrahim
Shekarau said late Thursday in the state capital.


"This is in line with our resolve to bring about a positive
change in the attitude of our students and to strengthen their
morality," Shekarau told a large crowed of veiled schoolgirls.


"We do not expect any private school in this state to fail in
this regard", Shekarau said without giving details about
penalties.


State schools in Kano have been obliged to follow a Muslim dress
code since 2003 when Shekarau was elected on the strength of his
promise to implement a stricter version of the Islamic sharia
legal system.


Under the dress code school girls wear a kaftan and trousers or
long skirts with a veil and boys wear a kaftan and trousers with
a cap.


Among the more than 2,000 private schools in the state a large
number are Islamic, many are mixed with both Muslim and Christian
students and a small minority are run by Christians.


Owing to the low standard of education in state-run schools, many
parents send their children to private schools.


Between 90 and 95 per cent of the population of Kano state are
estimated to be Muslims, and most of the remainder Christians.
