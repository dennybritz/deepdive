Northampton winger Ben Cohen has pulled out of England's summer
tour to South Africa and made himself unavailable for the World
Cup starting in September for family reasons.


Cohen, a World Cup winner in 2003, was included in Brian Ashton's
30-man squad for England's two-Test tour to South Africa on
Tuesday.


But he has decided to put his international career on hold for
the year in order to spend time with his wife, Abby, who is
expecting twins.


"Ben was very pleased to hear the news that he would be touring
with England but he has reflected on his selection and his
current personal circumstances," said Ashton.


"His wife is expecting twins later in the year so I understand
his reasons for withdrawing from the tour and from contention for
the Rugby World Cup squad to spend time with her."


Ashton will announce Cohen's replacement in the England squad on
Tuesday.
