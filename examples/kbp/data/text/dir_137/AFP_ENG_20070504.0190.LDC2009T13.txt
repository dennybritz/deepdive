Rioting Guinean soldiers shot dead a night watchman and wounded
dozens of others as they rampaged through five cities and towns,
witnesses said on Friday.


The soldiers riddled the man with bullets after he said he would
denounce them after they left their barracks in the town of
Nzerekore in the east of the country, a member of his family told
AFP by telephone.


It is the second night of trouble involving the military who are
demanding unpaid salaries totalling 300 million Guinean francs
(75.000 euros, about 100.000 dollars).


A military source said at least 25 people were injured in cross
fire on Wednesday night alone. There was no updated toll on
Friday.


According to several witnesses, gunfire reverberated all night
from military camps in Conakry, Macenta, which is some 800
kilometres south of Conakry, Kankan which is about 600 kilometres
east of the capital and from southeastern Nzerekore and Faranah.


Calm was reported to have returned Friday to the affected areas.


The army alleges that the authorities have been holding back
their salaries since 1996, the year when one mutiny claimed the
lives of 300 soldiers.
