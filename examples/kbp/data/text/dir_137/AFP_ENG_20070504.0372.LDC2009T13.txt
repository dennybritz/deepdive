Mali's leader Amadou Toumani Toure was confirmed on Friday as the
winner of the presidential election, a victory already disputed
by the opposition.


The minister of territorial administration, General Kafougouna
Kone, confirmed Toure had won with 70.88 percent of the vote in
last weekend's ballot.


According to the corrected figures which include the diaspora
vote, Toure garnered 1,622,579 of the 2,288,993 votes, Kone told
a press conference.


His closest rival, speaker of the national assembly Ibrahim
Boubacar Keita, trailed far behind with 436,781 of the votes or
19 percent of the ballots.


Toure's re-election, is yet to be validated by the constitutional
court.


But the opposition, alleging gross irregularities, filed a suit
on Thursday with the west African country's constitutional court
to have the election annulled.


Toure, 58, who ousted dictator Moussa Traore in 1991, installed a
multi-party system before stepping aside the following year. He
later stood for presidential elections and won easily in 2002.


The former general who is politically unaffiliated enjoyed the
backing of two large coalitions and a myriad of small parties.


A total of eight candidates were vying for the top job in this
vast west African country sitting on the edge of the Sahara
desert.
