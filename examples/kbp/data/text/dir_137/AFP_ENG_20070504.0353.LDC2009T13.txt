At least 20 people died and dozens more were missing after a
sailboat crowded with Haitian migrants capsized on Friday as it
was being towed by a Turks and Caicos police boat, the US Coast
Guard (USCG) reported.


Rescue crews were searching for about 58 Haitians who were
unaccounted for, the USCG said.


Early Friday, Coast Guard officials working in the area had been
notified that a Haitian vessel capsized while being towed by a
police boat about 800 meters (half a mile) off Providenciales,
one of the Turks and Caicos islands.   A USCG helicopter located
about 20 bodies, while police from the British overseas territory
rescued 73 people.


The 10-meter (30-foot) sail-freighter was apparently headed for
the United States, 900 kilometers (560 miles) away, with some 150
people aboard.


Every year, hundreds of Haitians fleeing their impoverished
nation make the illegal sea voyage aboard often overcrowded boats
in search of a better life in the United States.


The Coast Guard estimates more than 200 Haitians have died over
the past five years while trying to make their way to the United
States.


In March, a US Coast Guard crew recovered five bodies after a
sail freighter with 56 people aboard caught fire and capsized off
the Dominican Republic.


Since January, 909 Haitians have been interdicted by the Coast
Guard as they tried to make their way illegally to the United
States.
