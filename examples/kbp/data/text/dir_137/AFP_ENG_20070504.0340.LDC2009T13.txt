At least 20 people died and dozens more were missing after a
sailboat crowded with Haitian migrants capsized on Friday as it
was being towed by a Turks and Caicos police boat, the US Coast
Guard (USCG) reported.


Rescue crews were searching for about 58 Haitians who were
unaccounted for, the USCG said.


Early Friday, Coast Guard officials working in the area had been
notified that a Haitian vessel capsized about 800 meters (half a
mile) off Providenciales, one of the Turks and Caicos islands,
while being towed by a police boat.


A USCG helicopter located about 20 bodies, while police rescued
30 people.


The 10-meter (30-foot) sail-freighter was apparently headed for
the United States, 900 kilometers (560 miles) away, with some 150
people aboard.


Since January, 909 Haitians have been interdicted by the Coast
Guard as they tried to make their way illegally to the United
States.
