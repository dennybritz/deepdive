Shots have been fired in a bank in Budapest where an unknown
number of armed men are holding civilian hostages, police
spokesman Laszlo Bartha told AFP Friday.


"There may be one or more hostage armed hostage takers inside the
bank and shots have been fired inside the bank," Bartha said.


"The area around the bank has been sealed off," Bartha said.


The bank is located near Moszkva Square, one of the major traffic
