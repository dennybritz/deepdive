Five Iraqi policemen were killed on Friday when a bomb detonated
as they patrolled a Baghdad neighbourhood on the frontline of the
Iraqi capital's sectarian war, defence and security sources said.


Two more policemen were wounded as the blast tore through their
vehicle in the southwest Amil neighbourhood that has been the
scene of frequent clashes between Sunni and Shiite gunmen, they
said.


A massive joint US-Iraq security operation has put more than
80,000 troops on the streets of Baghdad in an effort to quell the
violence but the attacks have continued, especially insurgent
bombings.


In northern Iraq, a car bomb exploded near the city of Mosul
outside the home of Lieutenant Colonel Raad Harush, commander of
a local army battalion, injuring him and 13 others, including
five family members, said Brigadier General Mohammed al-Wagaa.


In the disputed oil city of Kirkuk, police raised the death toll
from a pair of car bombs targeting the homes of a police officer
and a local politician late Thursday to six dead and 41 wounded.


Four of the dead were children, including an infant of five
months, as were most of the wounded.
