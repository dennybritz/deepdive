Four members of staff were injured Friday in unrest at a high-
security London prison which holds some of Britain's most high-
profile Islamist militant suspects, a spokeswoman said.


The disturbances at Belmarsh prison in southeast London were
sparked after an inmate refused to hand over a laptop computer,
she said, adding that those injured were taken to hospital.


It was not immediately clear who was involved in the troubles,
but the prison has been home to suspects of the July 21, 2005
failed bomb attack in London, which came two weeks after four
suicide bombers killed 52.


Inmates are sometimes allowed to use computers to work on their
legal cases, although they are not allowed access to the
Internet.


"A prisoner was suspected of tampering with his ... laptop and
refused to hand it over, punching a member of staff. An
altercation ensued involving a member of staff and prisoners,"
said the spokeswoman.


"The incident was brought under control quickly."


The prison governor paid tribute to the guards involved. "Prison
officers are in the front line of protecting the public, said
Claudia Sturt.


"I am really proud of the bravery displayed by my staff, whose
courageous response brought this incident to an end quickly."
