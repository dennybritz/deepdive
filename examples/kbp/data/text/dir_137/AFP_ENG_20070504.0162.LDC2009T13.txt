Three Georgian students have been freed after spending more than
two months captive in Abkhazia, a rebel region of the ex-Soviet
republic, a spokesman for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili
said Friday.


The three, who were imprisoned on March 1 after entering the
rebel region on the Black Sea, were freed late Thursday, the
spokesman said.


Saakashvili, who has made a priority of restoring central control
over Georgia's two Russian-backed breakaway regions, issued a
statement criticising the Abkhaz authorities for "terrorising
people peacefully expressing an opinion."


The students had crossed into Abkhazia to urge ethnic Georgians
living in the south of the rebel province to boycott local
elections being organized by the separatist authorities.


Abkhaz authorities had said the three faced up to seven years in
prison.


Thousands of Georgians rallied in support of the students during
their imprisonment.


Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili denied that any deal had been
done to secure their release.
