Eight Pakistani soldiers were wounded Friday when a suspected
pro-Taliban militant hurled a hand grenade at a their convoy in a
remote tribal town bordering Afghanistan, a military official
said.


A man standing by the road lobbed a grenade when the convoy of
several vehicles reached Mir Ali in the restive tribal zone of
North Waziristan, the official said.


"Eight soldiers were injured and their vehicle was badly
damaged," said the official, who requested anonymity. The
attacker fled into the mountains.


Troops had cordoned off the area and an investigation was
underway, he added.


Militants linked to Afghanistan's ousted Taliban militia
regularly attack Pakistani troops in the area despite a peace
deal in September last year.


Pakistan poured thousands of troops into parts of the tribal belt
to hunt down Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants who fled the 2001
fall of Afghanistan Taliban's regime.


Operations in the area have left 700 soldiers and 1,000 militants
dead.


In late 2005 a top Egyptian Al-Qaeda explosives expert, Hamza
Rabia, was killed in a blast in North Waziristan.
