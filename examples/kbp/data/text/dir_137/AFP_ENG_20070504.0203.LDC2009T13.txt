Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya warned on Friday that
militants would put up a fight against any Israeli incursion into
the troubled Gaza Strip.


"It is the right of military factions to defend our homes against
any Israeli aggression," Haniya, of the Islamist group Hamas,
told worshippers during Friday prayers in Gaza City.


In recent weeks, numerous Israeli officials have advocated an
incursion into Gaza to stop militants from firing rockets on the
Jewish state and the alleged smuggling of weapons into Gaza from
Egypt.


The premier again accused Israel and its main ally, Washington,
of futile efforts to foment factional unrest among the
Palestinians.


"The Zionists and the Americans are working day and night to stir
up civil war between the Palestinian factions and Palestinian
brothers, but we confirm our unity," he said, repeating a charge
he first levelled in January.


Scores of Palestinians were killed in Gaza in factional violence
before the creation of a unity cabinet between the Hamas and
president Mahmud Abbas's secular Fatah party on March 17 put a
lid on the tensions.
