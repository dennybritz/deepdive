Italian cyclist Michele Scarponi, who is implicated in the
Operation Puerto doping scandal, will not take part in the Giro
D'Italia (Tour of Italy), Italian news agency ANSA reported on
Friday.


ANSA said Scarponi has opted out of the event, which runs starts
on May 12 and ends on June 3, as the 27-year-old rider feared the
controversy would have a negative effect on his Acqua and Sapone
team.


On Wednesday Scarponi, winner of the International Coppi and
Bartali Week stage race in March, agreed to give a DNA sample to
the Italian Olympic Commitee (CONI) in a bid to clear his name.


Last year's Giro D'Italia winner Ivan Basso, who is also
implicated in the scandal, had already ruled out defending his
Giro title.


Operation Puerto was the name given to a raid on the premises of
Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes in May 2006.


Madrid police uncovered bags of blood and doping products, along
with codenames of cyclists and documents which pointed to
organised doping.


Investigators in Germany recently confirmed that blood attributed
to 1997 Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich during Operation Puerto
turned out to match a DNA sample from the German.


Ullrich has proclaimed his innocence and since retired from the
sport.
