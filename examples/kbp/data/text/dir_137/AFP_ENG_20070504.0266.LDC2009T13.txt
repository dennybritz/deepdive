Sri Lanka's coach Tom Moody will decide his future with the World
Cup runners-up later this month, a Sri Lankan Cricket official
said Friday.


"Tom departed for Britain on a holiday," K. Mathivanan, secretary
of the Sri Lanka Cricket board, told AFP.


He said Moody, an Australian national, was expected to return to
Colombo on May 12 and will then discuss his future with the team
and the governing body.


"We will be announcing a decision on Tom's future on May 14,"
Mathivanan said.


Moody's contract ends on May 31 and he is due to tour Abu Dhabi
with the Sri Lankan team for a One Day International series with
Pakistan before then.


The former Australia and Worcestershire all-rounder was appointed
Sri Lanka's national coach in 2005 succeeding compatriot John
Dyson.


His name has been linked with Western Australia, the Australian
state side, after his contract with the Sri Lankans expires.


Moody has been reticent about his plans, repeatedly saying that
he would discuss them with the Sri Lankan authorities after the
World Cup.


Under Moody's tutelage Sri Lankans have had a remarkable run
overseas.


They swiped out England 5-0 in a One Day series while drawing the
Test series 1-1 in the summer of 2006, and early this year drew
1-1 in Test matches in New Zealand.
