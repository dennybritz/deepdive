A South Africa court dropped fraud, theft and corruption charges
on Friday against a former senior official with South Africa's
elite Scorpions crime- fighting unit, SAPA news agency said.


Ayanda Dlodlo who headed the force's strategic operations unit,
handed herself in to the police last October following an
investigation fraud and corruption in the National Prosecuting
Authority which houses the Scorpions.


She resigned in 2004 before taking up a senior position at the
department of safety and liaison in the province of Guateng which
covers Johannesburg and Pretoria.


The Scorpions are the South African equivalent of the United
States FBI and are answerable to President Thabo Mbeki.
