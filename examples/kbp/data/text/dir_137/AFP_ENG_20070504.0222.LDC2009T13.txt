Hochtief, Germany's biggest construction company, said on Friday
that net profit in the first quarter of 2007 was up 11.6 percent
to 9.6 million euros (13 million dollars) despite difficulties in
its domestic market.


Pre-tax profit was 66 million euros, a 31.5-percent increase on
the same period last year.


Hochtief said it was maintaining its aim for the whole year of
net profit of 100 million euros, compared with 89.1 million euros
in 2006, despite an expected loss in its Hochtief Europe unit,
which concentrates largely on activities in Germany.


It said that profits in construction and services such as airport
management would compensate.
