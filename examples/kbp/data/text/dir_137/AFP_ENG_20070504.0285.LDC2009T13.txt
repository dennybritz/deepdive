India's northern Punjab state Friday said it would probe reports
that police faked gunbattles to claim cash bounties during an
insurgency 14 years ago.


A police spokesman said the investigation was in response to news
reports that at least three Sikh separatists purportedly killed
by officers had been found alive.


"The state government has viewed these news reports with great
concern and considering the gravity of the issue involved, it has
ordered the probe," the spokesman said in Punjab's holiest Sikh
city, Amritsar.


Local media reports said the officers had claimed the 2.5 million
rupees (55,555 dollars) bounty offered by the state for the
capture or slaying of the three Sikh guerrillas.


A statement from Punjab police chief N.P.S. Aulakh's office also
said the investigation was in response to media reports.


However, some analysts linked the probe to bitter rivalries
between India's ruling Congress party and the main opposition
Hindu nationalist party, which wrested power in the Punjab from
the Congress in recent state polls.


The order followed the recent arrest of three police officers in
western Gujarat state on charges of killing a Muslim couple in a
staged gunbattle, and ongoing protests in Kashmir over extra-
judicial executions by Indian troops.


The armed rebellion for a Sikh homeland called Khalistan waned
following hard- fought elections in the northern state in the
early 1990s.


Around 50,000 people lost their lives in the conflict that
erupted in 1982.
