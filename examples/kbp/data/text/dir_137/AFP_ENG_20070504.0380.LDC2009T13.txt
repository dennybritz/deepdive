Slain Pakistani cricket team coach Bob Woolmer was on Friday
cremated during a private family function in Cape Town, the
family said.


"Yes, my father was cremated this morning (Friday). The service
was held at Doves (parlour) in Salt River at 11a.m (0900 GMT),"
Woolmer's son, Dale, told AFP.


"It was private and only family members attended," he said.


The body of Woolmer, who is believed to have been poisoned while
at a World Cup in Jamaica, arrived in South Africa last Sunday,
six weeks after his corpse was discovered in a Jamaican hotel
room.


A public memorial service for the 58-year-old former South
African coach, whose widow Gill lives in Cape Town's Pinelands
neighbourhood, was held in the city last month.


The English-born Woolmer was found dead in his Kingston hotel
room on March 18, the day after Pakistan crashed out of the
cricket World Cup in an upset loss to Ireland.


His body was held in legal limbo for weeks after an autopsy
indicated the former England Test player had been strangled, but
investigators have yet to make any arrests.


The Kingston coroner in charge of the case ruled that Woolmer's
body could not be released until after an inquest that had been
scheduled to begin on April 23 was completed.


Woolmer's death led to a fevered round of speculations. The most
common theory is that his death was linked to match-fixing and
illegal betting in cricket.


Some 30 police investigators are working full-time on the Woolmer
case and more than 100 witness statements have already been
taken.
