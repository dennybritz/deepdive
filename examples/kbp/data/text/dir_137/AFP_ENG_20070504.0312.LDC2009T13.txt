Police have decided to step up security measures ahead of
Saturday's French first division match between Paris St Germain
and champions Lyon at Paris's Parc des Princes.


Metro stations in the city will be under surveillance and a
greater number of stewards have been drafted in to patrol
entrance gates.


Police will also be operating metal detectors and have banned any
form of bottle or flammable material from being brought into the
ground.


In addition, 229 people have been barred from attending the game.
