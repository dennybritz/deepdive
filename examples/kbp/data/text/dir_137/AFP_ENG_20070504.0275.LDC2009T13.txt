Stephen Maguire and fellow Scot John Higgins were all square at
8-8 in their semi-final clash at the snooker World Championships
here on Friday.


They had previously shared the opening eight frames and were
still level at 6-6 at the mid-session interval in the best-of-33
showdown.


The initial session had been high on quality with two centuries
and four other 50-plus breaks and continued in the same vein
after a scrappy opening frame lasting 32 minutes.


Maguire eventually won that with the aid of a 31 break after
Higgins played a poor safety shot on the final yellow and left it
hanging over the middle pocket.


Higgins, the 1998 world champion, has yet to lead in the match
but he was quickly back on level terms with a 90 break in frame
10.


His opponent, competing in his first world semi-final, again
nosed ahead with a run of 63 in frame 11 proving decisive.


But Higgins responded and, although breaking down on 45, Maguire
was unable to capitalise after going in-off with the cue ball
after potting a red.


The other semi-final, an all English affair, sees 2005 champion
Shaun Murphy lead Mark Selby 5-3 going into their second session
on Friday.
