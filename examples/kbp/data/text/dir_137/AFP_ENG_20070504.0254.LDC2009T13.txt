A flashflood struck northeastern Afghanistan Friday, leaving 23
people dead and hundreds of homes without drinking water, a
provincial governor said.


The flood hit the mountainous Badakshan province, governor Abdul
Majid said.


"The flood left 23 dead. We have found 19 of the bodies; three
people are still missing," he said. More than 200 hectares (500
acres) of land was destroyed and 300 houses were without drinking
water.


Dozens of Afghans have been killed in flooding and avalanches as
winter snows melted.
