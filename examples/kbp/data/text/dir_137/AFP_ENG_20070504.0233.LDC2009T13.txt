German union IG Metall said on Friday it had agreed a 4.1-percent
pay rise for its 3.4 million members in Germany effective from
June.


That would be followed by a further pay rise of 1.7 percent a
year later.


The deal was thrashed out in 20 hours of negotiations with
employers in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg but will be applied
across Germany.
