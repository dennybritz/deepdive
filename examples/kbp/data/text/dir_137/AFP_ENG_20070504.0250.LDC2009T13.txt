Robbers hijacked, robbed and stripped a South African man before
glueing him on to his exercise bike, a report said Friday.


Kobus van Deventer, 50, was hijacked on Wednesday by an armed
gang of four robbers who forced him to take them to his home in a
suburb north of Johannesburg, SAPA news agency reported.


"The victim was then forced to strip, after which he was
superglued to the seat of an exercise bicycle, his hands were
superglued, as were his feet and then his mouth was superglued
shut," spokesman for emergency rescue service Netcare 911, Mark
Stokoe told SAPA.


While in the house, the "nicely dressed" robbers helped
themselves to the man's Chivas Regal whisky while ransacking the
house stealing seven firearms in the safe, Krugerrands, jewellery
and construction equipment worth about 250,000 dollars (180,000
euros).


Van Deventer told The Star newspaper Friday in an interview that
it had never crossed his mind that he would end up being
superglued, saying he had feared that he was going to be gang-
raped.


The asthmatic property developer was only rescued from the
bicycle by his wife, Elmarie, when she returned from work five
hours later.


"I couldn't believe it. I saw him sitting there on a bike trying
to free himself. His eyes were popping out... He was red with
sunburn and I thought he was having a heart attack," she said.


Chemicals were needed to help loosen the superglue.
