Africa's largest trading bloc will hold a 12-day meeting starting
next week in Nairobi to discuss ways of enhancing its free trade
zone, Kenya's trade ministry said Friday.


The meeting of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) will run from May 11 and cap with a heads of state
summit on May 22 and 23, the ministry said in a statement.


"The summit of the heads of state and government ... will be to
strengthen and consolidate the Free Trade Area," the statement
said.


"The summit will consider the progress made on the road map to a
customs union," it added.


The bloc was founded in 1994 when it replaced the Preferential
Trade Area which had been in existence since 1981.


COMESA groups Angola, Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles,
Sudan, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
