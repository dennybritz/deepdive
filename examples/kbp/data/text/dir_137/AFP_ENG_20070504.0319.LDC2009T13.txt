The German presidency of the European Union on Friday said the
jailing in Uzbekistan of activists Umida Niyazova and Gulbahor
Turaeva sent a "worrying signal" about human rights in the
country.


The EU had learned with "great concern" about the "harsh
sentences" passed on the activists, it said in a statement.


"The EU also deplores the fact that international observers were
not allowed to observe the trial despite previous requests," it
said.


Niyazova, 32, was sentenced on Tuesday to seven years in jail for
illegally crossing the Uzbekistan border, smuggling and
distributing publications threatening public order. Turaeva was
jailed for six years the week before.


"The EU urges the Uzbek authorities to immediately review the two
cases and to fully respect the principles of due and fair trial
according to Uzbekistan's commitments to international human
rights standards," the statement said.


It said the sentences were worrying at a time when the EU was
considering whether to renew sanctions adopted in 2005 after
Uzbek security forces cracked down on demonstrators in Andijan.


The Uzbek authorities claim that 18 people were killed, but human
rights organisations claim the true death toll is in the
hundreds.
