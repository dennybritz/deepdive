US software giant Microsoft and web portal Yahoo have revived
talks to explore a merger or alliance, The Wall Street Journal
reported Friday.


Citing people familiar with the situation, the newspaper said
that executives at Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. appeared to be
in early-stage discussions to take "a fresh look at a merger of
the two companies or some kind of match-up that would pair their
companies' respective strengths."


A year ago, the two companies had explored the idea of combining
to form a greater competitor to search-engine giant Google Inc.,
but the talks "led nowhere," the paper recalled.


Management changes at both companies since then could help
facilitate a pairing, it said.


The talks were first reported in the New York Post.


Microsoft and Yahoo could not be reached for comment, The Journal
said.
