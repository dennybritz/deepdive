A convicted sex offender was jailed for life Friday for the rape
and murder of a Polish student, in a case which shocked Britain
last year.


Peter Tobin, 60, was found guilty of murdering 23-year-old
Angelika Kluk last September, and hiding her bound and gagged
body beneath the floor of a church.


Tobin, who had been jailed for 14 years for a sex attack on two
schoolgirls in 1994, was ordered to spend at least 21 years in
jail after his conviction by a jury at the High Court in
Edinburgh.


Kluk's sister Aneta shouted "Thank you" to the jurors, while the
judge told him he was evil.


"What you did to Angelika Kluk was inhuman," Judge Lord Menzies
told Tobin. "You are, in my view, an evil man."


Kluk's body was found dumped beneath the floor of Saint Patrick's
church in a suburb of Glasgow after the killing last September.
She had suffered severe head injuries and multiple stab wounds.


During the investigation it emerged that the Tobin had befriended
Kluk after turning up at the church in August 2006 using the
alias Pat McLaughlin and asking for odd jobs, revealing nothing
about his past crimes.


"In the course of my time in the law I have seen many bad men and
I have heard evidence about many terrible crimes which have been
committed but I have heard no case more tragic, more terrible
than this one," said the judge.
