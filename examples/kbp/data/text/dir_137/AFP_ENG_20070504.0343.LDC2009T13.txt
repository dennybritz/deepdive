Shots were fired Friday in a bank in Budapest where an unknown
number of armed men were holding civilian hostages, police
spokesman Laszlo Bartha told AFP.


"There may be one or more armed hostage takers inside the bank
and shots have been fired inside the bank," Bartha said.


"The area around the bank has been sealed off."


Hungarian public television quoted private news agency Fuggetlen
as saying that one armed robber fired a shot at the bank wall and
took the gun of a security guard.


One of Fuggetlen's journalists was reportedly inside the bank at
the time of the robbery.


More than 30 police vehicles were reportedly at the scene,
together with a police commando team.


The bank, a branch of Hungary's OTP, is located near Moszkva
Square, one of the major traffic hubs on the western side of the
Hungarian capital. Huge snarl-ups were reported across the city.
