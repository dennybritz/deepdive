Germany's powerful IG Metall union said on Friday it had agreed a
4.1-percent pay rise for its 3.4 million members in Germany,
effective from June.


That would be followed by a further pay rise of 1.7 percent a
year later.


The deal was thrashed out during 20 hours of negotiations with
employers in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg but will be applied
across Germany.


Workers covered by the deal will also receive 400-euro payments
in April and May, before the new agreement comes into effect.


The negotiations sought to find an end to a dispute punctuated by
one-day strikes.
