Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Friday he
would cease to respect US pharmaceutical giant Merck's patent on
the AIDS drug Efavirenz after refusing the company's 30 percent
price-cut offer.


The decision marked the first time that Brazil decided to
disregard the patent of a medication, and Brazil will now go
ahead and import the generic medicine from three laboratories in
India.


The government, which has programs to distribute free AIDS
medicine to patients, had threatened such a move in the past but
was holding out for the possibility of a last-minute agreement
with drug company.
