The Netherlands said Friday it will appeal against a Swiss
surpreme court ruling that it could not recover a ransom of
nearly one million euros paid to free a kidnapped MSF relief
worker in Russia.


Dutch citizen Arjan Erkel was abducted in the Russian republic of
Dagestan, near Chechnya in August 2002 while on an aid mission
and held for 20 months.


The kidnappers demanded a ransom of one million euros (1.4
million dollars), and MSF reportedly paid 230,000 euros while the
Dutch foreign ministry raised 770,000 euros.


On March 15 the Swiss court ruled that Medecins Sans Frontieres
(Doctors Without Borders, MSF) does not have to pay back the
Dutch state.


The Dutch foreign ministry said in a press release Friday that it
was launching an appeal as a matter of principle.


"The ruling gives the impression that the Dutch state helps with
paying ransoms," the ministry said.


"The Netherlands maintains its position that it never negotiates
with kidnappers and never pays ransoms," it added.


The Hague has always said that the money raised to free Erkel was
a loan to MSF.


MSF meanwhile claimed the money they raised was a loan to the
Dutch government. The organisation also insists that it never
pays ransoms to kidnappers to prevent their aid workers from
becoming likely kidnap targets.


The dispute is fought out before the Swiss courts because Erkel
was employed by the Swiss branch of MSF.


The Dutch foreign ministry said it expected it would take at
least a year before the appeal is heard.
