A state government in northern India has announced plans to
sterilise tens of thousands of monkeys after complaints from
farmers that the animals are destroying crops.


Thousands of farmers and activists gathered outside the state
legislature of northern Himachal Pradesh state in capital Shimla
this week to demand action.


"We now plan to operate on 65,000 monkeys in urban areas of the
state," state forest minister Ram Lal Thakur told reporters late
Thursday.


After sterilisation, the monkeys will be observed for five days
before being released again.


The government is training veterinarians for the massive
sterilisation programme. Thakur did not say how long the
sterilisation scheme would take.


There are more than 300,000 monkeys in the state, up from an
estimated 60,000 in 1985, according to government figures.


Wildlife experts say monkeys come into conflict with humans when
their natural habitat in forests is destroyed.
