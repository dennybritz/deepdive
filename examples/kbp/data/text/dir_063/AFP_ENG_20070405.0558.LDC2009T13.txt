Oxford's hopes of springing a surprise against favourites
Cambridge in the boat race between the English Universities rests
on the first Pole ever to compete in the annual event.


Oxford have won the race five times in the last seven years, but
they are regarded as underdogs for Saturday's 4.25-mile contest
on London's River Thames because they have only one oarsman with
experience of the gruelling event.


So Poland's Michal Plotkowiak will play a key role if the
defending champions are to retain their crown.


Plotkowiak grew up in Poznan, which boasts Poland's best rowing
course, and has spent four years in the Polish junior and
under-23 national squads, as well as winning the German national
sprint singles title.


He won a fully-funded scholarship to study biomedical
engineering, but it is the Boat Race that is the focus of his
attention now.


"It's good that someone from Poland is finally rowing in the
race," Plotkowiak told the Daily Telegraph. "I hope that this way
rowing can some day become more popular in Poland."


Cambridge's bid to regain the title they last won in 2004 rests
on their crew's experience. They include British Olympians Kieran
West and Tom James, plus German world champions Thorsten
Engelmann and Sebastian Schulte.


Their cox, Russ Glenn, would love to land another knockout blow
on Oxford after he also represented Cambridge in the Varsity
boxing match earlier this year.
