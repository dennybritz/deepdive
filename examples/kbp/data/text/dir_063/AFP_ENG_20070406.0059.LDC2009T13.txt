An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.5 hit Japan's central
peninsula of Noto Friday in the latest aftershock following last
month's initial 6.9-magnitude quake, officials said.


The latest jolt occurred at 3:18 pm (0618 GMT) with its epicentre
below the Wajima area on the west coast of the main island of
Honshu, the meteorological agency said.


There was no danger of a tsunami, the agency said. It had warned
that strong aftershocks were forecast to continue to strike the
region. There was no immediate news on casualties or damage.


The region has been hit by hundreds of aftershocks since the
March 25 quake which killed one person and injured more than 200.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes.
