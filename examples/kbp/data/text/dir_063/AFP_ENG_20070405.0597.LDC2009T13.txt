South Korea and China plan to set up military hotlines to handle
unforeseen situations in the Yellow Sea as part of efforts to
strengthen their security ties, officials said Friday.


The deal will be finalised at talks next week between South
Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao,
military officials said. Wen is scheduled to visit Seoul on April
10-11.


South Korean Defence Minister Yoon Kwang-Ung offered to set up
military hotlines at talks with his Chinese counterpart Cao
Gangchuan in Seoul last April. Yoon also proposed holding joint
naval rescue operations.


"The issue of setting up hotlines has been discussed at working-
level meetings following talks between the defence chiefs of the
two countries," a defence ministry official told AFP on condition
of anonymity.


"A final deal should be made at talks between Roh and Wen," he
said.


Chinese troops fought for North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean
War. But Seoul and Beijing have stepped up economic and
diplomatic cooperation since they normalised ties in 1992.


Military officials said the hotlines would help China and South
Korea exchange information on the infiltration of any
unidentified aircraft or ships onto the Korean peninsula.


The hotlines will also help the two countries reduce tensions in
the Yellow Sea, where dozens of Chinese vessels engage in illegal
fishing every day, they said.


Currently, South Korea operates naval hotlines with Japan,
Russia, Indonesia and Malaysia.
