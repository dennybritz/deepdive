A member of North Korea's International Olympic Committee arrived
in South Korea Friday heading a delegation for talks on launching
a united governing body for taekwondo.


"I have just come here to celebrate the inauguration of the ITF
(International Taekwondo Federation) office in Seoul," Jang Ung
told reporters, according to Yonhap news agency.


Jang heads the ITF, which is run by North Korea. It opened a
branch in Seoul in January.


On Sunday, Jang is scheduled to meet Choue Chung-Won, head of the
World Taekwondo Federation, which is led by South Korea.


The two federations agreed in Qatar last December to form a
coordinating body to discuss a merger. Its first meeting will be
in Beijing on March 31.


"Progrees is being made. A roadmap is already in hand but we need
more discussion," Jang said.


ITF officials said earlier that Jang would reaffirm North Korea's
support for the bid by South Korea's eastern alpine resort of
Pyeongchang to host the 2014 Winter Olympics.
