The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest bourse, has
joined Nasdaq in the hunt for more listings by Chinese companies,
state media reported Friday.


"We expect a very good year in terms of Chinese companies coming
to our market and will easily surpass last year's performance,"
said Noreen Culhane, executive vice-president of NYSE Group,
according to the China Daily.


During a visit to China, Culhane had talks with more than 20
companies in Shanghai, Beijing and the eastern city of Nanjing
and several have expressed an interest in listing on the New York
bourse.


Robert Greifeld, the chief executive officer of Nasdaq, visited
China earlier this week on a mission seen aimed at attracting
more Chinese listings.


So far 21 Chinese companies have listed on the New York stock
exchange, the China Daily said.


"The performance of these Chinese companies in the US market has
been extraordinary, both in terms of price appreciation and
liquidity," Culhane said.


The average share price appreciation of the three Chinese
companies that went for initial public offerings on New York
stock exchange last year was 127 percent, the report said.


The three firms were named as Trina Solar, New Oriental Education
and Technology Group Inc, and Mindray Medical International, it
added.
