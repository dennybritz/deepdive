A two-year-old Egyptian girl has been diagnosed with bird flu,
the 33rd human case of the disease reported in the country, the
official news agency MENA reported on Friday.


Fatima Faruq Abdel Gauwad, from the governorate of Minya, south
of Cairo, was hospitalised on Wednesday with a high fever, health
ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahin was quoted as saying.


The girl, who had been in contact with birds suspected of having
the H5N1 strain of the virus, was treated with Tamiflu and her
condition is said to be stable.


Women and children have borne the brunt of the virus because of
their role in caring for domestic fowl. Egypt has been the
country hardest hit by the virus outside Asia.


The government says it is conducting a vigorous campaign to
combat the spread of the virus through vaccinations and raising
awareness, but cases continue to appear. So far the virus has
claimed 13 lives in Egypt.
