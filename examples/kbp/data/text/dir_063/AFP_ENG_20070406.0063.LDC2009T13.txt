Doctors deemed by Myanmar's military rulers to be overcharging
for their services could face up to five years in prison under a
law enacted this week, official media said Friday.


Private doctors who overcharge their patients or who work without
a license now face unspecified fines and up to five years in
prison under the new law, which was signed by junta leader Than
Shwe on Thursday, the official New Light of Myanmar newspaper
said.


The health minister Kyaw Myint in November had accused private
hospitals and clinics of overcharging for their services and had
promised to take action.


The report did not give details on what would be considered
overcharging.


Myanmar, with one of the world's worst health care systems, has
20 small private hospitals where only the very wealthy can afford
to seek treatment, mainly in its biggest city Yangon.


The vast majority of the population has only limited health care
from government clinics, in a country that the United Nations
estimates spends just 0.5 percent of its gross domestic product
on health.


Myanmar's top leadership prefers to seek medical treatment
overseas.


Than Shwe spent two weeks in Singapore for medical checks in
January, and Prime Minister Soe Win has been hospitalised in the
city-state since mid-March.
