A suspect in the killing of four Frenchmen in Saudi Arabia was
shot dead by police on Friday, and a policeman was killed, in a
shoot-out in the holy city of Medina, the interior ministry said.


The official news agency SPA quoted a ministry source as saying
"this person implicated in the foul crime perpetrated against the
four French citizens ... had been hunted by the security services
and is called Walid Motlaq al-Raddadi."


The four victims were in a party of nine French people from three
families living in Riyadh, the capital. On February 26 they were
on an outing to Madain Saleh in northwest Saudi Arabia, a popular
destination among expatriates.


Three adults and a teenager were killed when two people opened
fire on them with machine guns after they lost their way 90
kilometres (55 miles) from Medina.


No claim of responsibility was ever made for the attack.


The attack was the first in three months against Westerners in
Saudi Arabia. The oil-rich kingdom was rocked by a spate of
bombings and shootings blamed on suspected Al-Qaeda militants
that started in May 2003, triggering a relentless security
crackdown on Islamist extremists.


The interior ministry has since warned Western governments of the
danger of further attacks on foreigners, and the British and US
embassies joined the French in issuing warnings to their
nationals.
