Defending National Basketball Association champions Miami, who
have battled injuries all season, booked their playoff berth
Thursday with a thrilling overtime victory over Cleveland.


Shaquille O'Neal and Antoine Walker scored 20 points apiece as
the Heat downed the Cavaliers 94-90.


Udonis Haslem scored 15 points for the Heat, improved to 41-34
and hold a 1 1/2-game lead over Washington for the top spot in
the Southeast Division and the fourth seed in the Eastern
Conference.


Miami, which has been without its two best players - Shaquille
O'Neal and Dwyane Wade - for a combined 67 games this season, has
gone 14-7 in Wade's absence.


Even more remarkable, the Heat have made up six games on the
Wizards during that span.


The Heat have won four of their last six games and appear to be
picking up steam heading into the postseason thanks to O'Neal,
who shot 9-of-13 and grabbed eight rebounds.


Walker was 7-of-11 for the Heat, who outscored the Cavaliers 11-7
in the extra period to secure the victory.


Superstar LeBron James collected 35 points, nine rebounds and
five assists for the Cavaliers, who are 3 1/2 games behind idle
Detroit for the top spot in the Central Division and the East's
best record.
