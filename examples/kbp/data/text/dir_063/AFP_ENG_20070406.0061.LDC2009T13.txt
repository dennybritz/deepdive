Publication of a key UN scientific report on the impacts of
global warming, due to be issued at 0800 GMT Friday, has been
delayed, officials confirmed, as delegates said the US, China and
Saudi Arabia had objected to the tough-worded text.


The objections sparked a protest that politicians were meddling
in the scientific assessment about climate change, the delegates
said.


"This is the first time that the science is being questioned by
politicians," they quoted one angry delegate as saying.


A spokesman for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) said a press conference that had been scheduled to take
place at 0800 GMT to unveil the landmark document had been
delayed.


He did not give a new time.


The report is part of the IPCC's first review in six years of the
evidence for man-made climate change.


The dispute centres on a "summary for policymakers" about the
known effects of climate change and a prediction of these impacts
for the 21st century.


The United States, China and Saudi Arabia lodged objections to
sections of text and graphics that gave high-level warnings about
some of these effects.


The summary accompanies a 1,400-page report, a copy of which was
obtained by AFP.


It predicts that damage to Earth's weather systems from
greenhouse gases will change rainfall patterns, punch up the
power of storms, boost the risk of drought, flooding and water
stress and accelerate the existing meltdown of glaciers and
erosion of ice sheets.
