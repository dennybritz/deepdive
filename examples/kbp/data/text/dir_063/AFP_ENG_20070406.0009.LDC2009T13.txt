Group of Seven finance chiefs are likely to discuss currencies at
their meeting in Washington next week but will not focus on the
weakness of the yen, Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi said
Friday.


"Discussion on exchange rates is likely to include the yen, the
dollar, the euro and the yuan," he said.


But finance ministers and central bank heads from the G7
industrialised nations "will not particularly focus on the yen"
at their meeting on April 13, Omi told reporters.


The G7 ministers opted for a relatively soft line on the sliding
Japanese yen at their February meeting in Germany, despite
European concerns about the currency's weakness which hurts
eurozone exporters.


Omi said the finance chiefs from Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States will also discuss the
health of the global economy and the future of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).


"We will focus on the outlook for the world economy including
Japan, as well as IMF reforms and various other issues," he said.
