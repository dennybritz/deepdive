Global steel giant Arcelor-Mittal said Friday it has raised its
offer for minority shares in Arcelor Brazil to 51.27 reals per
share from 32.79 reals after the Brazilian market regulator CVM
demanded an increase.


In September, the CVM ordered Arcelor Mittal to make an offer for
minority holdings in its Brazilian unit, but an initial offer in
October drew complaints from shareholders and prompted the CVM to
demand a higher price.


The new offer, involving a mixture of cash and shares, would
result in a maximum cash payout of 10.9 billion reals, or 4.0
billion euros (5.4 billion dollars), and a maximum of 76 million
new shares being issued.


This amount of shares would equal five percent of Arcelor
Mittal's total share capital on a fully diluted basis.
