The Pentagon will call up 12,000 National Guard soldiers for
service in Iraq to fill gaps in the overworked army, a report
said Thursday.


The National Guard is a volunteer militia, but, said NBC News,
they will receive an involuntary call-up to report for duty in
Iraq.


Guard units are based in each US state. Four states will provide
the troops from four brigades, the television network said,
citing unnamed Defense Department sources.


The call-up follows closely President George W. Bush's
controversial "surge" of 21,000 troops, meant to quell the
sectarian violence among Iraqis as well as Al- Qaeda fighters
determined to sow chaos.


However, US troops are being rotated in and out of Iraq,
sometimes without the customary training, sometimes without the
customary 12 months' rest at US bases.


Pentagon sources told NBC that the orders for the deployment
awaited Defense Secretary Robert Gates's approval.


Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, have been trying
to hem in Bush, by conditioning continued war funding on setting
a timeline for drawing down troop levels in Iraq.
