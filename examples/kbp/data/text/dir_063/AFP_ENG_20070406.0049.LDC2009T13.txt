A veteran FBI agent was shot and killed  Thursday by another
agent while they were staking out a heavily armed gang of bank
robbers, according to law enforcement officials.


The death of the first Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in
the line of duty since the September 11, 2001 terror attacks was
announced by the bureau in a statement. It did not confirm he had
been shot by his fellow agent.


FBI spokesman John miller said in a statement that the man "was
shot and mortally wounded while working a criminal investigation
into a series of armed bank robberies."


But citing unnamed officials, the New York Daily News reported
that, while waiting to move in on the thieves as they hit a bank
in Readington, New Jersey, one agent accidentally fired his rifle
as he jumped out of a van, striking long- time agent Barry Lee
Bush, 52, in the armpit where he was not protected by body armor.


The stakeout, with a Swat squad, captured three of the gang
members, but a fourth managed to flee.


Heavily armed with AK-47 assault rifles and .380 semi-automatic
pistols, the gang had robbed several banks in the same area in
recent weeks and the FBI considered them extremely dangerous.
