Sri Lankan naval craft sank a suspected Tamil Tiger boat off the
island's northwestern coast Friday, killing at least two rebels,
the military said.


Naval patrol craft engaged five boats believed to belong to the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) off the coastal district
of Puttalam and one was sunk, a military spokesman said.


"We believe one was carrying at least two suicide cadres and it
exploded and sank when we opened fire at it," the spokesman said,
adding the other four boats escaped.


A naval craft was damaged and a sailor was wounded during a
firefight, the spokesman said.


The sea battle came two days after the Sri Lankan air force said
it had destroyed the main Sea Tiger headquarters. The Tigers
denied the air force claim and said a charity had been bombed by
aircraft.


The Sri Lankan air force suffered a humiliating blow last week
when Tiger light aircraft bombed its main base next to the
island's only international airport and managed to escape
unchallenged.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005.
