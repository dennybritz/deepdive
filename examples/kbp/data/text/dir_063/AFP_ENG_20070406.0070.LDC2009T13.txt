Chinese share prices rose 0.13 percent for another record finish
Friday despite a further hike in bank reserve requirements as the
government seeks to cool the fast growing economy, dealers said.


The People's Bank of China said Thursday the required deposit
reserve ratio for commercial lenders would rise by 0.5 percentage
points to 10.5 percent after two similar increase this year and
three in 2006.


Dealers said the market managed to shrug off early credit-
tightening fears and was back to the positive territory once
again backed by the strong fund inflows.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, added 4.45 points at 3,323.59. Turnover continued heavy
at 121.98 billion yuan (15.8 billion dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 4.59 points or 0.13 percent to
3,492.96 on turnover of 121.38 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index put on 13.29 points or 1.45 percent at 929.39, also
a record, on turnover of 65.48 billion yuan.
