A suicide bomber slammed his car into a police checkpoint on
Friday in the restive western city of Ramadi, killing at least 20
people and wounding another 30, police said.


"At least 20 people are killed and another 30 wounded," police
Colonel Tark al- Dualiami told AFP.


He said two of the dead were policemen, adding that at least
another two police officers were wounded.


Ramadi, the provincial capital of the Sunni Anbar province, is a
stronghold of Sunni insurgents and a prime base of Al-Qaeda
operators.
