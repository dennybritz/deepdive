The opposition-party mayor of Bangladesh's fourth-largest city
was arrested Friday as part of the military-backed government's
nationwide crackdown on corruption, police said.


Badruddin Ahmed Kamran, mayor of the northeastern city of Sylhet,
was taken from his government house after a warrant was issued
for several corruption cases, police sub-inspector Harunur Rashid
said.


"He has already been sent to jail," the officer said.


Kamran, also the regional party chief of the main opposition
party Awami League, is a two-time mayor of the city of half a
million people.


But he has been widely accused of selling state-owned properties
at throwaway prices.


Last month the mayor of Chittagong, Bagnaldesh's second-largest
city, was arrested in the anti-graft drive.


Nearly 50 top-ranking politicians including the son of outgoing
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia have been arrested since the crackdown
was launched in February.


On Wednesday an anti-graft watchdog issued an arrest warrant for
Harris Chowdhury, Zia's once-powerful political secretary, after
he failed to follow orders to submit a wealth statement.


The military-backed government came to power in January after the
president suspended polls and declared a state of emergency
following months of political turmoil.
