China's 18-year-old striker Yu Dabao has signed a three-year
contract with Portuguese club Benfica, the Beijing Times said
Friday.


Currently on loan from Chinese club Qingdao Hailifeng, Yu has
agreed a more permanent move worth 400,000 euros (535,000
dollars) to join Benfica, which is currently second-place in the
Portuguese league, the paper said.


While on loan since the beginning of this year, Yu, an Under-18
international last season, scored 12 goals in just eight
apperances for Benfica's development side.


Following his full contract deal, Yu, considered one of China's
most promising attackers, will be assured of regular first team
football in the Portuguese league, the report said.
