The son of the late French president Francois Mitterrand and
former interior minister Charles Pasqua are among 42 defendants
who will stand trial in the arms-to-Angola case, a judicial
source said Friday.


Jean-Christophe Mitterrand has been charged with bribe-taking in
connection with the sale of 790 million dollars (590 million
euros) in arms to Angola from 1993 to 2000, the source said.


Judge Philippe Courroye signed the indictment for the trial late
on Thursday. It also cites former Mitterrand adviser Jacques
Attali, novelist Paul-Loup Sulitzer and member of parliament
Georges Fenech as defendents.


Dubbed "Angolagate" by the press, the case revolves around
illegal arms sales negotiated through businessmen Pierre Falcone
and his associate Arcady Gaydamak to shore up the forces of
President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos in his war against UNITA
rebels.


Angola's 27-year war ended in 2002 after claiming half a million
lives.


Falcone and Gaydamak, who served as go-betweens for the arms
deliveries from eastern Europe, are facing charges of influence-
peddling and illegal arms sales.


French prosecutors last week requested that the 42 including
Mitterrand, who was his father's Africa adviser from 1986 to
2002, be put on trial in a 500-page summary of a case that dates
back to 2000.


The trial could begin as early as next year.
