More than 100 Taliban militants seized control of a district
headquarters in southern Afghanistan's Zabul province early
Friday, the provincial governor's spokesman said.


Police made a "tactical" withdrawal from Khak Afghan district
after the Islamist rebels attacked from several directions at
once, spokesman Ghulam Shah Alikhil told AFP.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, which has
tens of thousands of troops in Afghanistan, said it was checking
the information.
