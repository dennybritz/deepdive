A car belonging to the Cypriot embassy in Athens sustained
serious damage in an arson attack by unknown assailants early on
Friday morning, a police source said.


The car, which bore diplomat license plates, was parked in the
Athens suburb of Neo Faliro, near the port of Piraeus.


It was not immediately clear whether the attackers specifically
meant to target the embassy of Cyprus, which is considered a
sister nation by Greeks, police said.


Cars with diplomat plates are frequently targeted in Greece in
attacks attributed to self-styled anarchists. The attacks occur
late at night and rarely cause any injuries.
