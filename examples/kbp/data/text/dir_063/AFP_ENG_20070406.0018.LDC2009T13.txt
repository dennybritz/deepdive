Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has called for talks with South Korea
on a free trade area to be fast-tracked ahead of his visit to
Seoul next week, state press reported Friday.


"China and South Korea should come up with a win-win FTA proposal
at an early date so as to pave the way for the FTA," Xinhua news
agency quoted Wen as telling South Korean journalists on
Thursday.


Wen will be in South Korea on Tuesday and Wednesday for the first
visit by a Chinese premier in eight years.


Trade between the two nations has increased 26-fold since the two
countries forged diplomatic relations in 1992, reaching 130
billion dollars last year, according to Chinese figures, and Wen
said he expected ties to deepen further.


"As a result of economic globalization, China-South Korea trade
ties have entered a new era, requiring us to expand cooperation,
improve quality and cope with challenges together," Wen said.


South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-Chong said Wednesday that
his country would consider launching free trade talks with China
after a joint study by Seoul and Beijing on costs and benefits is
completed in December.


The United States and South Korea on Monday reached a free trade
agreement which scraps tariffs on thousands of items and will
boost commerce by billions of dollars a year, wrapping up 10
months of tough negotiations.
