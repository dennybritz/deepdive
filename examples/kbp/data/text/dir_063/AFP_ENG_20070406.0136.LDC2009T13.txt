US Treasury official Daniel Glaser left here Friday with the
impasse over millions of dollars in frozen North Korean bank
accounts that has stalled disarmament talks unresolved, the US
embassy said.


"The US government team has departed to Washington but our
discussions in common with all parties continue," said
spokeswoman Susan Stevenson.


Glaser met with Chinese, North Korean, South Korean and Macau
officials during 13 days of talks here in an effort to arrange
the return of about 25 million dollars frozen in a Macau bank by
US financial sanctions.


North Korea is demanding the return of the money before it will
cooperate further on a new nuclear disarmament accord it signed
in February.
