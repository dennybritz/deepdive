A priest accused of starting a brawl after tempers boiled over
during a round of golf on Thursday pleaded not guilty to felony
assault charges during a court appearance in California.


Michael Babin, a bishop at the Genesis Ministries International
outside San Diego, together with his son Gabriel and a third man,
Ruchell Robinson, are alleged to have attacked another golfer
following a dispute over a golf ball.


Prosecutors say Babin accused the victim, Jason Jennings, of
trying to steal his ball after it plunged into a water hazard at
the Oceanside Municipal Golf Course on February 17 this year.


Jennings was knocked to the floor by Babin and beaten unconscious
by Robinson, according to witnesses. He was taken to a hospital
with severe facial trauma.


All three men are charged with assault to produce great bodily
injury, battery with serious bodily injury and misdemeanor
battery, charges which carry a maximum sentence of four years in
prison and a 10,000-dollar fine.


Babin's lawyer said the priest was "100 percent innocent."


"I think everyone at at the sixth hole handled the situation
wrong," said Neal Gibbons following the hearing at Vista,
southern California.
