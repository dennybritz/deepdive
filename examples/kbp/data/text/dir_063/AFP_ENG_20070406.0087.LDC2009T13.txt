More than 100 Taliban militants seized control of a district
headquarters in southern Afghanistan's Zabul province early
Friday, the provincial governor's spokesman said.


Police made a "tactical" withdrawal from Khak Afghan district
after the Islamist rebels attacked from several directions at
once, spokesman Ghulam Shah Alikhil told AFP.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF),
which has tens of thousands of troops in Afghanistan, said it was
checking the information.


The seizure of the district comes at the same time as a massive
offensive launched last month by ISAF and Afghan army troops in
nearby Helmand province, where rebels have held a small town for
nearly two months.


The Taliban, who are leading a bloody insurgency more than five
years after US- led forces toppled them from government, have
also occupied other districts in southern and western Afghanistan
this year.


In most cases foreign and government forces have driven out the
rebels after a short time.
