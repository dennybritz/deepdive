Bird flu has killed a teenage girl in Indonesia, taking the death
toll in the country worst hit by the deadly virus to 73, an
official said Friday.


"The girl died (Thursday)," said a spokesman from Indonesia's
bird flu information centre. "She has been confirmed positive for
the virus by two labs."


The 15-year-old girl had been admitted to intensive care in the
capital Jakarta and was the sprawling archipelago nation's 93rd
confirmed case, the spokesman said, declining to be named.


A 29-year-old man showing bird flu symptoms died Wednesday in
Solo, about 500 kilometres (300 miles) from the capital. Tests
are being conducted to confirm he had the virus.


Most human infections have occurred after contact with sick
birds. The government has banned the popular practice of keeping
chickens in backyards in Jakarta to try and curb the disease's
spread.


Indonesia had hoped to eradicate human fatalities from the virus
this year, but has recorded at least 15 deaths.


The World Health Organisation says the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu has infected 288 people and killed 170 of them, mostly in
Southeast Asia, since 2003.


Scientists say multiple strains of the disease originated in
southern China and spread elsewhere.


They worry the virus could mutate into a form easily spread among
humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to kill
millions.


The fear stems from the lessons of past influenza pandemics. One
in 1918, just after the end of World War I, killed 20 million
people worldwide.
