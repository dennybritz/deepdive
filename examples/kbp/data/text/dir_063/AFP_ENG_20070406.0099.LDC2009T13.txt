A suicide bomber slammed his car into a police checkpoint on
Friday in the restive western city of Ramadi, killing at least 20
people and wounding another 30, a security official said.


Two of the dead were policemen, the official told AFP, adding
that at least another two police officers were wounded.


Ramadi, the provincial capital of the Sunni Anbar province, is a
stronghold of Sunni insurgents and a prime base of Al-Qaeda
operators.
