China plans to build 12 new highways linking its northwestern
Xinjiang region and Central Asia, state media reported.


The planned roads will connect the region with China's neighbours
including Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan, the Xinhua
news agency reported late Thursday, citing the regional transport
administration.


The longest one will stretch from Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, to
Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, the report said.


From Tashkent onwards, people travelling by car will be able to
reach Iran's Mashhad, Turkey's Istanbul and ultimately Europe,
the report said.


The road will be completed before 2010, it said, without
detailing when the other highways will be opened.


Energy-hungry China has actively courted central Asia's resource
rich nations over the last few years as it seeks to power an
economy that continues to roar ahead at average growth rates of
around 10 percent.
