A roadside bomb blast killed one more US soldier and wounded two
others in the restive Diyala province, north of Baghdad, the
military reported Friday.


The soldier died on Thursday when the bomb exploded near his
vehicle.


The latest fatality brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the invasion to 3,262, according to an AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.
