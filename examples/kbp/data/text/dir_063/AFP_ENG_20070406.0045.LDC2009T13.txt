The publication of a key UN scientific report on the impact of
global warming was set to be delayed on Friday amid objections
from the United States, China and Saudi Arabia, delegates said.


The objections sparked a protest that politicians were meddling
in the scientific assessment about climate change, they said.


"This is the first time that the science is being questioned by
politicians," an angry delegate said.


The report had been due to be issued at 0800 GMT Friday by the
UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as part of
its first review in six years of the evidence for man-made
climate change.


The main document is a "summary for policymakers" about the known
effects of climate change and a prediction of these impacts for
the 21st century.


The United States, China and Saudi Arabia lodged objections to
sections of text and graphics that gave high-level warnings about
these effects.


The body of the report, a copy of which was obtained by AFP,
predicts that damage to Earth's weather systems from greenhouse
gases will change rainfall patterns, punch up the power of
storms, boost the risk of drought, flooding and water stress and
accelerate the existing meltdown of glaciers and erosion of ice
sheets.
