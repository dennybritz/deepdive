Martin Brodeur continued to add to his list of achievements as
one of the best goaltenders to play in the National Hockey League
on Thursday.


Brodeur turned away 34 shots as he set the league's single-season
record for victories with 48 as the New Jersey Devils defeated
the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2.


Brodeur (48-23-7) surpassed the mark set by Bernie Parent with
the Flyers in the 1973-74 season.


He added another distinguished mark to a Hall of Fame career that
includes two Vezina Trophies, three Stanley Cups, six 40-win
seasons and nine All-Star Game appearances.


The 32-year-old netminder collected 13 saves in the first period,
eight in the second and stopped all 13 shots he faced in the
third as the Devils took control of the game.


Jim Dowd's shorthanded goal 8:46 into the third snapped a 2-2 tie
en route to New Jersey clinching both an Atlantic Division title
and the second seed in the Eastern Conference for the upcoming
Stanley Cup playoffs.
