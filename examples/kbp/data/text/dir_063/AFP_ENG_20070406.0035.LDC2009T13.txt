A 13-year-old girl has died of bird flu in Cambodia, the
country's seventh fatality from the H5N1 virus, the health
ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Friday.


"She died midday on April 5. Samples from the girl tested
positive for the influenza A/H5N1 virus at the Pasteur Institute
of Cambodia in Phnom Penh," they said in a joint statement.


The girl, who was from eastern Kampong Cham province on the
border with Vietnam, fell ill with a fever and diarrhoea on
Monday and was brought to a local hospital the next day, they
said.


The girl was sent to a hospital in the capital Phnom Penh on
Wednesday after her condition worsened, the statement said.


It was the first human case of bird flu in Cambodia so far this
year, the statement said.


"The Ministry of Agriculture is conducting a detailed
investigation into poultry in the area around the village, but it
appears that some chickens had been dying in the village before
the girl become ill," it said.


A team of investigators from the health ministry, the WHO and the
Pasteur Institute have gone to the area to determine whether
there were any more cases, the statement added.
