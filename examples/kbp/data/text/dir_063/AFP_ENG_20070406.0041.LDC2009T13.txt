Chery Automobile became the first Chinese auto maker to top the
domestic car sales list since 1987 by selling 44,568 vehicles in
March, state media reported Friday.


The company's sales last month beat the 40,071 units at Shanghai
GM, a General Motors joint venture, 38,627 at Shanghai VW and
37,016 at FAW-VW, two joint ventures of Volkswagen AG, the
official Xinhua news agency said.


The four best sellers held a combined 33 percent of China's car
market in March, the report said.


Wang Chao, a spokesman for Chery, told AFP that his company sold
10,019 units abroad in March and exports in the first three
months were close to 30,000 vehicles.


Chery said earlier this year that it aimed to boost its exports
to 70,000 units this year from 50,000 in 2006.


"Our business (overseas) is going well," Wang said. "We will
definitely meet the goal of 70,000 and are trying our best to do
even better."


The company, based in the eastern province of Anhui, became
China's seventh largest auto maker and fourth largest producer of
sedans in 2006, with sales of 305,200 vehicles including 272,400
sedans, Xinhua said.


It has or is setting up seven assembly plants in Russia, Egypt,
Iran, Indonesia, Ukraine and Uruguay.
