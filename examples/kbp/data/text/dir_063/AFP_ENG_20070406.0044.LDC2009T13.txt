An Iraqi detainee at the US-run detention facility Camp Cropper
near Baghdad airport died two days ago, the military reported on
Friday.


The detainee was pronounced dead on April 4 and an investigation
is on to determine the cause of death, the military said.


Almost half a dozen security detainees have died since November
in US-run facilities in Iraq which hold thousands of Iraqis
without charge but who are considered security threats.
