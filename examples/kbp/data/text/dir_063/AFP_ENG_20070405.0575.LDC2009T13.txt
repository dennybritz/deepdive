Japanese share prices dropped by 0.31 percent in morning trade on
Friday as investors continued to pocket recent gains ahead of the
release of key US jobs data, dealers said.


They said that with US and European stock markets closed Friday
for the Good Friday holiday, investors in Tokyo were also taking
a breather.

fell 54.38 points to 17,437.04 by lunch.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
