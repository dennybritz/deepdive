Four people including a policeman were killed Friday in a suicide
car bomb attack near the Afghan parliament in the capital Kabul,
police said.


The bomber detonated a car filled with explosives a few hundred
meters (yards) from the legislative building, killing three
civilians and one policeman, Kabul criminal investigation police
chief General Alishah Paktiawal told AFP.


"It was a suicide bombing. Four people were killed and four
others were injured," he said.
