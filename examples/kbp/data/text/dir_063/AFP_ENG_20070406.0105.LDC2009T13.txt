South Korea sent 400,000 dollars in cash to North Korea Friday to
help the cash- strapped communist country purchase more equipment
for video reunions of separated families, officials said.


The Red Cross said its members left for Pyongyang with the money
on a ship which was also carrying 50 trucks for North Korea flood
victims. It was to arrive in the North later Friday.


"This is the first time South Korea has sent cash aid to North
Korea through Red Cross channels," Red Cross spokesman Kim Hyung-
Sup told AFP.


The money will be used to purchase computers and flat panel TV
monitors, which will be set up at a family reunion centre in
Pyongyang, he said.


South Korean officials said the cash aid was inevitable because
Seoul is not allowed to ship sensitive items such as computers to
Pyongyang under a US law on the control of strategic goods.


More than 90,000 people in South Korea alone have not seen loved
ones since the end of the 1950-53 war.


The two Koreas have held more than a dozen rounds of face-to-face
reunions involving 13,000 from both sides since their 2000
reconciliation summit.


Some 2,700 others have greeted each other by video link using
existing facilities, sometimes because they are too old and
infirm to travel for physical reunions.
