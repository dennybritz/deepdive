Five South Korean workers were killed and seven others injured
after the collapse of parts of a bridge being built between two
southern islands, police said Friday.


At least two of the injured were in critical condition after the
accident Thursday, they said.


The roadbed of the bridge collapsed while being hoisted onto
supports, killing at least two workers instantly.


More than 160 police and rescuers searched for others buried deep
under the wreckage. The rescue was halted early Friday after a
fifth body was recovered.


The cause of the accident was still being investigated.


The bridge is intended to link the island of Sorok to the nearby
island of Geogum, off the south coast of the peninsula.
