Half the candidates in East Timor's presidential poll said Friday
they fear many attempts have been made to manipulate the election
process ahead of Monday's vote.


"We fear that there are a lot of attempts to manipulate the whole
election process," the candidates said in a joint statement.


"There's been a lot of intimidation, a lot of violence, and a lot
of threats. We fear that violence can occur on the day of the
vote."
