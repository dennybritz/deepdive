At least 27 people were killed when a vehicle modified to take
passengers and cargo blew a tire, flipped into a creek and caught
fire in northern Colombia, police said Thursday.


The regional police commander, General Rafael Parra, said that at
least 14 people were also injured.


"The death of these people was caused by the vehicle catching
fire more than by the impact," Parra said, adding that the driver
was killed in the accident.


The accident occurred on the highway linking the cities of Santa
Marta and Riohacha, police said.


Passenger Agustin Salas told reporters he survived because he was
thrown from the vehicle at the moment of impact. "I had my
grandson on my lap, so when I fell out I began to pull him by his
feet because people had landed on top of him," he said.


Salas however did not know the fate of his daughter and other
grandson who were also traveling in the vehicle, and said he
hoped to find among the injured rushed to area hospitals.


Up to now 13 women, two men and six children were confirmed
killed in the accident. Six other burnt adult bodies were
recovered from the wreckage but were so damaged police could not
determine their sex, Parra said.
