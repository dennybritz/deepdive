The Russian parliament condemned on Friday an order by Ukrainian
President Viktor Yushchenko to dissolve parliament, saying it
violated the constitution and "sends the most dangerous signal".


"Deputies share the assessments of Ukrainian lawmakers and
constitutional law experts that this decree contradicts relevant
articles of the Ukrainian constitution," the parliament said in a
declaration, adopted by a vote of 342 to three.
