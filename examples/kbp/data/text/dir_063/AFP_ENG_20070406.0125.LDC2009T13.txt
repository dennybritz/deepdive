The Russian airline Aeroflot is to hold talks next week with Air
France-KLM on a possible joint bid for the troubled Italian
carrier Alitalia, the newspaper Vedomosti reported Friday.


Vedomosti quoted a source close to Aeroflot as adding that
negotiations could nonetheless be complicated owing to Alitalia's
accumulated debt of one billion euros (1.34 billion dollars).


The Russian airline declined to comment on the report.


It surprised the airline sector last week by announcing that it
would head a group in bidding for Alitalia, in which the Italian
government plans to sell a stake of at least 39.9 percent.


The state currently owns 49.9 percent of the Italian airline, and
any buyer of 39.9 percent would be obliged to make an offer for
the rest.


Air France-KLM and Alitalia each own 2.0 percent of each other's
capital, and all four airlines belong to the Skyteam alliance.


The Franco-Dutch carrier has repeatedly been the subject of
rumours concerning an Alitalia takeover, despite its repeated
denials.


Bidders for the government's shares in Alitalia have until April
16 to present preliminary offers, including business plans for
the Italian airline.
