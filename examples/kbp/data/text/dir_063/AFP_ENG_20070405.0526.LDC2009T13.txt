Japanese video game giant Nintendo is likely to post a record
current profit of 260 billion yen (2.2 billion dollars) for the
year to March 31 thanks to brisk sales, a report said Friday.


The figure would be up 62 percent from a year earlier, exceeding
the company's January projection by 50 billion yen, the Nikkei
business daily said without citing sources.


Nintendo's net profit is believed to have risen 47 percent from a
year earlier to roughly 145 billion yen, beating the forecast by
about 25 billion yen, the newspaper said.


Its operating profit is seen to have jumped some 120 percent to
more than 200 billion yen, up from an earlier projection of 185
billion yen.


The stronger-than-expected performance was mainly due to robust
sales of Nintendo's DS hand-held game device and compatible games
as well as the yen's weakness compared with the previous fiscal
year, the Nikkei said.


Sales of DS machines are likely to have surpassed the firm's
target of 23 million units, while sales of the company's new Wii
game console are believed to have exceeded six million units, the
report said.


On Thursday, Nintendo revised its overall sales forecast to 966
billion yen, up 66 billion yen from previous expectations, while
providing no fresh profit forecasts.


The Kyoto-based firm is to disclose its full financial figures on
April 26.
