Ferrari's Felipe Massa topped the times in Friday morning's
opening practice session for Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix.


The 25-year-old Brazilian clocked the best time of one minute and
34.972 seconds to finish two-tenths of a second ahead of
defending champion Spaniard Fernando Alonso in a McLaren.


Formula One rookie Lewis Hamilton of Britain was third in the
second McLaren and Finn Kimi Raikkonen was fourth in the second
Ferrari on a hot day at the Sepang circuit.


There were few major incidents in the session and only a sparse
crowd braved the torrid conditions to turn out for the action.


With the leading contenders for the championship swiftly out and
setting the pace on a hot morning, Alonso slid off the circuit at
turn nine after 42 minutes.


Soon after that unscheduled excursion, Japan's Kazuki Nakajima
followed suit and went off at turn 15, the final hairpin before
the start-finish straight.


The top four were already half a second quicker than their rivals
within an hour's practice, a clear signal that the weekend is
likely to see a reprise of the Ferrari-McLaren duel at the
season-opening Australian Grand Prix.


Alonso, in his efforts to reduce the advantage enjoyed by the
Italian team, went off and over the kerbs again at turn one, a
long looping right-hander at the end of the straight.


In the closing stages of the session, Hamilton trimmed his time
to take third place.
