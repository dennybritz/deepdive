Four Muslim men have been killed in shooting attacks by suspected
Islamic militants in Thailand's restive south, police said
Friday.


Two Muslim men, aged 26 and 35, were gunned down in a drive-by
shooting on their way to a mosque late Thursday in Narathiwat,
one of the three insurgency-plagued provinces bordering Malaysia.


Two other men were killed in separate attacks in Narathiwat --
one 52-year-old was gunned down in an ambush, while a 51-year-old
was killed when militants opened fire on his home, police said.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in Thailand's Muslim-
majority south since an insurgency broke out in January 2004.


Thailand's military-installed government has launched a raft of
peace measures, only to see the attacks escalate in the past six
months.


Although Buddhists in the region feel increasingly vulnerable,
Muslims with links to the government are often targeted for
attack.
