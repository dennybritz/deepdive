Water supplies for about 150,000 people in southwest China may
have been contaminated after high levels of heavy metals were
discovered in a local river, state press reported Friday.


Excessive lead and other heavy metals were this week registered
in a 100-kilometre (60-mile) section of the Honghe River in
Guangxi region, the Xinhua news agency reported.


Tests on pollutant levels are under way and the cause of the
pollution is being investigated, the report said, adding that the
supplies for about 150,000 people may have been affected.


One of the seven water plants in the area has already suspended
supplies, while the impact on the other six has yet to be
determined, it said.


The incident is the latest to highlight major water problems in
China, where around 300 million people do not have access to
clean water, according to previously released official figures.


In November 2005, around 100 tonnes of the carcinogens benzene
and nitrobenzene poured into the Songhua River in China's
northeast, after a blast at a chemical plant operated by oil
major Petrochina.


The explosion killed eight people and forced water supplies for
millions of people living along the Songhua to be suspended for
days, with the pollution eventually flowing into Russia's
waterways.


In another high-profile incident in August last year, a tanker
loaded with 25 tonnes of liquid caustic soda crashed into a river
in northern China's Shaanxi province, threatening the water
supply for 100,000 residents.
