China will not see any major power shortages in 2007, easing
concerns over energy bottlenecks that have hampered the economy
since the start of the decade, state press reported Friday.


"With a number of power stations coming on line, there will be a
balance between supply and demand this year," the China Daily
reported, citing Vice Chairman of the State Electricity
Regulatory Commission Wang Yeping.


China first reported failures to meet power demand in 2000 and
the problem has recurred over the years since then as the economy
has grown faster than supply could keep up.


The country suffered its worst power shortages in 2004, with more
than two thirds of all provinces and regions affected, despite
power generation rising 14.9 percent that year.


In the following two years, the southwestern Yangtze River delta
and the southern Pearl River delta, the nation's two economic
powerhouses, grappled with shortages.


The state planning body has said that after 2007 the shortages
would be remedied.


Most areas in the country will achieve a balance between demand
and supply, and overall and there will even be a surplus, it
said.


China's installed generation capacity rose 20.3 percent in 2006
to 622 gigawatts, of which coal-fired power units accounted for
77.8 percent. Output is expected to reach 700 gigawatts this
year, according to Wang. One gigawatt is equal to one billion
watts of electricity.
