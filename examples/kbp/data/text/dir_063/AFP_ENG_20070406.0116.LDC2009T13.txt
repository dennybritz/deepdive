Students and skilled workers will have to meet higher English
language standards if they want to migrate to Australia under new
laws announced on Friday.


The changes, which come into force in September, are designed to
ensure migrants have a better chance of securing a job amid a
shortage of skilled workers.


"We need to improve that level of English if they're going to
stay on and work in Australia," Immigration Minister Kevin
Andrews told ABC radio.


"It's important from the position of the student who wants to
stay here and have a job.


"It's also important from the position of the employer to ensure
that somebody coming here and staying on a skilled migration visa
is able to understand English and therefore do the job."


Under the new laws, migrants with professional, technical or
managerial skills will be required to achieve a score of six, or
competent English, on the International English Testing System.


Previously the acceptable level was five, the same standard
required of applicants with recognised trade skills.


Students who want to apply for a general skilled migration visa
will also have to have a stronger understanding of the English
language and undertake relevant work experience, Andrews said.


Opposition immigration spokesman Tony Burke said the new measures
were long overdue.


"We can't continue to have highly qualified engineers who aren't
able to converse at the workplace, ending up driving Sydney
cabs," he said.
