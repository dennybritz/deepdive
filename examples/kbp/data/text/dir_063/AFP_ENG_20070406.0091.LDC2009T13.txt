US plans to deploy elements of a missile defence system in
eastern Europe risk triggering a new international arms race, the
lower house of the Russian parliament said on Friday in a
declaration.


"Such decisions are already today bringing about a new split in
Europe and unleashing another arms race," read the declaration,
which was approved unanimously.
