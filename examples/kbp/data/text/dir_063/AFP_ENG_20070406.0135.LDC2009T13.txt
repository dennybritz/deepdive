The European Cup, which was all but fatally holed on Thursday
with next season's boycott announced by clubs from France and
England, could still be saved, the Rugby Football Union (RFU)'s
chairman Martyn Thomas said Friday.


A dark cloud hangs over the future of the elite event after
France and England, who between them have supplied nine of the
past 11 European champions, announced they were going ahead with
their forecast pull outs.


But Thomas told the BBC: "We remain available 24/7 to meet
Premier Rugby and seek a solution. The Cup can be saved."


And Leicester chairman Peter Tom also suggested all might not be
lost for the competition.


"There would have to be meetings in a very short period of time
in which all of the current issues can be agreed. I don't think
we can continue in the way we have before with lots of different
sets of talks.


"We need to be prepared to lock ourselves in a room for 24 hours
to sort it out."


The RFU have threatened to take legal action if English clubs did
not compete because they would be breaching contractual
obligations.


Both the French and the English have claimed that they share the
same reason for the boycott - the RFU granting English clubs
equal shareholding in the European Cup.
