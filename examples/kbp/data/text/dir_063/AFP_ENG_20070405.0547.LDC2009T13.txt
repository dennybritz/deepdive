Japan's foreign exchange reserves rose to an all-time high of
908.96 billion dollars at the end of March from the previous
record of 905.05 billion dollars in February, the finance
ministry said Friday.


Tokyo's foreign exchange reserves remain the second largest in
the world, after China, whose holdings reached 1.07 trillion
dollars at the end of 2006, according to official data from
China's central bank.


Foreign exchange reserves consist of securities and deposits
denominated in foreign currencies, plus International Monetary
Fund reserves, IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) and gold.


Japan's large foreign exchange reserves are the result of years
of currency intervention by the government to keep the yen down
against the dollar and help exporters stay competitive.


However, Japan's monetary authorities have not intervened since
March 2004, allowing the yen to find its own level against the
dollar.
