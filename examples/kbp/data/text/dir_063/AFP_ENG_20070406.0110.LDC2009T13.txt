Agreement was reached here Friday on a key UN report on the
impacts of global warming, the chairman of the  Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, told
reporters.


"We have just completed a marathon meeting. It was a productive
but tiring exercise," Pachauri said, adding however, "In the end
we have what I think is a very good document."


Publication of the report had been delayed after the US, China
and Saudi Arabia had objected to tough-worded text, delegates
said.


The amended and agreed text would be submitted to a full session
of the IPCC later Friday for its approval, a delegate said.


The report is part of the IPCC's first review in six years of the
evidence for man-made climate change.


The dispute centred on a "summary for policymakers" that
accompanies a 1,400-page report.


The document paints a grim panorama of current and future damage
to Earth's weather systems from fossil-fuel pollution and other
greenhouse gases.


Global warming will change rainfall patterns, punch up the power
of storms, boost the risk of drought, flooding and water stress
and accelerate the existing meltdown of glaciers and erosion of
ice sheets, according to the main report.


The impacts for human settlement and wildlife are almost
universally bad and, in some computer models, catastrophic if
carbon emissions continue to grow unabated.
