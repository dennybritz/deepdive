The number of ducks and swans wintering in Shanghai has dropped
by 90 percent in the past two years due to the soaring
temperatures caused by global warming, state media reported
Friday.


Shanghai ornithologist Yuan Xiao said that "extremely warm winter
weather" was behind the massive decline.


However, the first survey of its kind by local bird experts
showed that the number of species visiting Shanghai's wetlands, a
key habitat on China's eastern coast, has remained relatively
stable, reported the China Daily.


During the past winter, average temperatures were 8.1 degrees
Celsius (46.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Shanghai, the highest since
records began in 1873, state media reported last month.


The Shanghai Meteorological Bureau said global warming was to
blame and the figures were in line with other data released in
recent months showing unprecedented temperature highs throughout
China.


According to the Shanghai ornithologists' report, 117 species
spent the past winter in the city's wetlands, including 13
regarded as rare.


Three new bird types were also seen in the city for the first
time -- sand cranes, Siberian swans and little stints, according
to Yuan.


The newspaper said the project was the first thorough survey of
Shanghai's water birds.


The city's wetlands are regarded as internationally important
habitats for water birds.
