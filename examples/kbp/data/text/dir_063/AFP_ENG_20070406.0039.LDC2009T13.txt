Japanese share prices closed flat Friday as investors waited for
the release of key US jobs data later in the day, dealers said.


They said that with many overseas markets closed for the Good
Friday holiday, investors in Tokyo were also taking a breather.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 6.64 points to 17,484.78.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section shed 3.64 points or 0.21 percent to 1,717.08.
