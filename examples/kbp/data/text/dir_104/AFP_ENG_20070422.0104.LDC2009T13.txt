Suspected Muslim rebels have slit the throats of two Hindus,
police said Sunday, as hundreds protested the killing of a Muslim
woman in Indian-held Kashmir.


Police said the two Hindus were abducted when they went into the
forest on Friday to collect firewood. Their bodies were found
late Saturday in the insurgency-wracked Himalayan region.


"They have been killed by terrorists," a police statement said.


Indian security forces battling a separatist insurgency that
erupted in the restive region in 1989 often refer to rebels as
"terrorists."


No rebel group has claimed responsibility for the killings, which
came as several hundred villagers chanted anti-government slogans
Saturday following the death of a Muslim woman.


Police said the woman died in cross-fire between militants and
Indian troops.


But residents said troops had fired at a group of women
collecting firewood, killing one of them on the spot.


Nine people were hurt in the protests when riot police fired
teargas and used batons to disperse the demonstrators, police
said.


The 18-year-old insurgency against Indian rule has left more than
42,000 people dead, according to official figures.


Police also on Sunday recovered the bodies of three militants
killed by an avalanche after heavy snowfall in Doda district.
