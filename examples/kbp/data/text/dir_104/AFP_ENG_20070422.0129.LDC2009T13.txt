Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki met  Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Sunday to discuss preparations for next month's
international conference on Iraq.


Ministers from the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, the Group of Eight and Iraq's neighbours are
set to meet in Sharm el- Sheikh on May 3-4 to try to find ways to
end Iraq's bloodshed.


Maliki's talks with Mubarak and Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed
Nazif were also due to focus on bilateral relations and how Egypt
can contribute to the search for stability to the war-torn
country.


After the regional security conference, talks will be held on the
UN-backed "International Compact", a framework agreement for
foreign donors to contribute to Iraqi reconstruction and
development projects.


Maliki was accompanied by Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani,
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rafie al-Issawi and
National Security Advisor Muwaffaq al- Rubaie.


Maliki will go to Kuwait after Egypt, his office said.
