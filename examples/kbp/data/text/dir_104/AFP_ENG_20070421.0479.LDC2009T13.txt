Jamaica's World 100m record holder Asafa Powell has pulled out of
upcoming meetings because of tendinitis in his knee, his manager
said Saturday.


Powell was scheduled to run at next weekend's Penn Relays in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and at the Jamaica International
Invitational Meet on May 5 here. In Kingston he was to have run
his first individual 100m race this year.


However, Powell's manager Paul Doyle said his athlete is not 100
percent and therefore they will not rush him into action.


Doyle also said the minor injury was the same one that prompted
Powell to withdraw from the Mt. Sac Relays in California last
weekend.


Powell had made the trip to Walnut, east of Los Angeles, but
decided it was too windy and chilly to risk aggravating the knee.


"It's the same injury, but it's not too serious," Doyle said. "We
don't want him to race at full speed if he is not 100 percent."


Powell has said his main focus will be on the World Championships
in Osaka this summer, and he would race a light schedule leading
up to the year's main competition.


Although the Jamaica International Invitational is two weeks
away, Doyle said, "There is a big possibility that he will miss
that as well".


Doyle said Powell "is still training, but we are just going play
it day by day. We just want to play it safe."
