Rightwing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday cast his vote along
with his wife Cecilia at a polling station in a Paris suburb, in
France's presidential election.


The pair, accompanied by two of Cecilia's daughters, were watched
by a small crowd of onlookers as they arrived on foot at the
polling station in the town of Neuilly-sur-Seine.


Sarkozy is favourite to make it through Sunday's first round to
the run-off vote on May 6.


The socialist Segolene Royal is in second place, according to
opinion polls, with centrist candidate Francois Bayrou and far-
right veteran Jean-Marie Le Pen in third and fourth place.
