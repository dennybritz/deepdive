Insurgents killed two more US soldiers in Baghdad, taking the
military's losses to 57 in this month alone, the military
reported Sunday.


Both the soldiers were attacked and killed on Saturday.


One soldier died and another was wounded when their combat patrol
was attacked with small arms fire in an eastern section of
Baghdad.


Another soldier was killed and three more were wounded when their
vehicle came under a coordinated attack of a roadside bomb
followed by small arms fire in a southwestern region of Baghdad.


The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,317, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
