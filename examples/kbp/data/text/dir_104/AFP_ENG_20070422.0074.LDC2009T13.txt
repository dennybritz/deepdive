Japan is considering asking Washington to lift a current ban on
exporting US stealth fighters so it can buy the high-tech
aircraft, a press report said Sunday.


The defence ministry may want the radar-evading F-22As after
acquiring cheaper upgraded F-15FX fighters, Kyodo News reported.


These fighters would replace Japan's ageing fleet of F-4s to be
scrapped beginning in April 2008, the report said, quoting
sources close to the matter.


The acquisition of the state-of-the-art fighters is aimed at
boosting Japan's air defence in the face of North Korea's nuclear
arms threat and improving joint operations with the US air force,
it said.


Japan's current five-year military plan calls for the purchase of
seven planes to replace the F-4s by March 2010.


The total procurement cost for Japan's next-generation mainstay
fighters is estimated at one trillion yen (8.4 billion dollars),
sources said.


Although the export of the F-22A, codenamed as the Raptor, is
currently banned by the US Congress, Japanese defence officials
believe the ban will be lifted in the future, Kyodo said.


Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma said in an interview published
Saturday he would ask for information on advanced fighters when
he meets his US counterpart Robert Gates in Washington on April
30.


"Information must be made available to us for the selection of
aircraft," Kyuma said. "I want to convey this feeling to the US
side."
