One of Nigeria's leading opposition parties on Sunday blasted the
country's landmark presidential election as "a mess" and
complained of "widespread irregularities."


The Action Congress (AC) party said in a statement that in
preparing Saturday's poll, the national electoral commission
(INEC) had devoted its time to trying to exclude the AC
candidate.


It had not spent enough time preparing the poll, the AC said.


INEC had barred AC candidate, Vice President Atiku Abubakar, from
running for the presidency as he is facing corruption
allegations. But the commission's decision was overturned last
week in an 11th-hour ruling by the Supreme Court that caused
severe last-minute delays to printing ballot papers.


"INEC has turned what would have been a landmark election into a
mess of unimaginable proportion, due to a combination of sheer
incompetence and lack of political will," the AC statement said.


The party also said that in every state where AC has a large
following INEC "deliberately ensured inadequate supply of voting
materials."


"If this is not rigging, we don't know what else to call it," the
statement continued.


AC also complained that many of the ballot papers used for the
election lacked serial numbers.


This last concern was also voiced Saturday by the European
observer mission monitoring the poll, due to lead to the
country's first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power since
independence in 1960.
