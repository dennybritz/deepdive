Fred Rodriguez won the sixth and penultimate stage of the Tour of
Georgia here Saturday, as Discovery Channel's Janez Brakovic
retained the overall lead.


Predictor-Lotto rider Rodriguez took the win in a sprint finish
to the 182.9km stage from Lake Lanier Islands to this suburb east
of Atlanta.


He was gratified by the victory, after battling illness this
year.


"It has just been in the last couple of weeks coming back on
form," said California's Rodriguez, who sprinted from the pack
with 150m left. "I didn't even know myself how good I was going
to feel."


CSC rider Juan Jose Haedo of Argentina was second and George
Hincapie of Discovery Channel third.


Hincapie's Discovery teammate Brajkovic finished in the leading
pack to retain the leader's yellow jersey heading into Sunday's
seventh and final stage, a circuit race that starts and ends in
Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park.
