Iran rejects any suspension of its sensitive uranium enrichment
activities, the foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday, ahead of
key talks next week with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.


"Halting uranium enrichment is definitely deleted from the
literature of Iran's nuclear activities," foreign ministry
spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told reporters.


"In our negotiations the halting of this activity has not been on
the table and going back on time is not envisaged," he added.


His comments come ahead of eagerly awaited talks on Wednesday at
a location that has yet to be confirmed between Solana and Iran's
top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani in a bid to break the
deadlock in the nuclear standoff.
