North Korea has named a career field army commander as its new
military head, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency
(KCNA) indicated in a story filed late Saturday.


Kim Kyok-Sik, who is believed to be 67, succeeded his predecessor
Kim Yong-Chun as the chief of the general staff of the communist
country's 1.1-million-strong army, it said.


Yong-Chun was appointed this month as the deputy of the National
Defence Commission (NDC) following 12 years in the top military
post.


Chaired by leader Kim Jong-Il, the NDC is the most powerful
organisation in North Korea.


Kyok-Sik's rise to the key post remained unknown until KCNA
called him the head of the general staff in a report Saturday on
Kim Jong-Il's inspection of two military units.


"(Kim Jong-Il) was accompanied by the head of the general staff
Kim Kyok-Sik" and other military leaders, the agency said.


South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Kyok-Sik had spent most of
his career in the field army.
