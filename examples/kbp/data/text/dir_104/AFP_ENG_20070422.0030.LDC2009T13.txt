A young woman was injured in a bomb blast in the troubled
southern Philippines Sunday -- just days after another attack.


Police said the 20-year-old woman was injured when an improvised
device was thrown at a roadside stall in a remote village in
North Cotabato on Mindanao island.


Superintendent Chino Mamburam told AFP the woman, Arlene Nilgas,
"sustained shrapnel injuries but has been declared out of
danger."


Witnesses told police that two men on a motorbike threw a
backpack at the stall and sped off. They were arrested later at a
police roadblock.


Police refused to identify the suspects, who are still undergoing
interrogation.


It was the second bomb blast in Central Mindanao in four days.


Last Wednesday, a man was killed when the bomb he was carrying
exploded prematurely in Cotabato City just hours after an
election rally for the May mid- term elections.
