Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Sunday that recent
repeated overtures by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were
"vague declarations" that were not sufficient to reach a peace
deal.


"The vague declarations by Bashar al-Assad do not suffice to show
a strategic change with a view on reach a real peace agreement,"
Olmert told public radio.


"The Americans continue to think that Syria is a part of the axis
of evil and no country that matters to us, notably in Europe,
thinks that Syria truly aspires to peace," he said.


"We wish to make peace with all Arab countries, including Syria,
but during the past 12 years there have been three attempts at
negotiation with Syria that have failed," he said.


Assad has repeatedly made peace overtures in recent months to
Israel, but the Jewish state rejected them, saying Damascus must
first stop supporting militant groups in Lebanon and the Gaza
Strip.


Peace talks between Israel and Syria collapsed in 2000, mainly
because of deadlock over the return of the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and unilaterally annexed in
1981.
