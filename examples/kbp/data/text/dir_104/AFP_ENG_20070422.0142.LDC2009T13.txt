Italian Simone Corsi, riding an Aprilia, won the 125cc Turkish
Grand Prix here on Sunday, edging out Spain's Joan Olive and
Japan's Tomoyoshi Koyama.


It was Corsi's first Grand Prix victory in his 64th race and was
merited after a thrilling battle with Olive that he won only in
the final bends.


Italian Mattia Pasini, who started on pole, developped a
mechanical problem after the third lap and fell down to 30th.
