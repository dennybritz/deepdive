Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki left on Sunday for Cairo to discuss
preparations for next month's international conference on Iraq to
be held in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, his office
said.


Maliki will travel on to Kuwait after the Egypt stopover, a
statement from his office said.


Ministers from the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, the Group of Eight and Iraq's neighbours are
set to meet in Sharm el- Sheikh on May 3-4 to find ways to end
Iraq's bloodshed.
