India on Sunday successfully tested a surface-to-surface version
of the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile developed jointly with
Russia, official sources said.


"Sunday's test was just routine. A user trial," a defence
official told AFP on condition of anonymity. The missile was last
successfully tested on February 4.


The missile was fired from a mobile launcher from the Integrated
Test Range at Chandipur-on-sea, 200 kilometres (125 miles)
northeast of eastern Orissa state capital Bhubaneswar, official
sources said.


First tested in June 2001, the missile named after India's
Brahmaputra River and Russia's Moskva River has a range of 290
kilometers (180 miles) and can carry a 300-kilogram (660 pound)
conventional warhead.


The eight-metre (26-foot) missile weighs about three metric
tonnes and can be launched from land, ships, submarines or
aircraft, traveling at a speed of up to Mach 2.8.


Sunday's test came just 10 days after India successfully tested
the Agni-III, an intermediate-range missile that for the first
time gives New Delhi a device capable of hitting targets inside
China, including capital Beijing.


The Indian army is set to start deploying the missile this year,
the CEO of its manufacturer BrahMos Aerospace A. Sivathanu Pillai
said last month.


A version of the BrahMos is already used by the Indian navy.


Defence sources said India and Russia are now working towards
developing a hypersonic missile, a more advanced version of the
BrahMos.
