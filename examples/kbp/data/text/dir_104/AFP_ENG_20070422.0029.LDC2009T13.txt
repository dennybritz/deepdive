Frenchman Raphael Jacquelin captured his second career title at
the BMW Asian Open here on Sunday with a two-shot win in
atrocious weather conditions after leading the tournament from
day one.


The 32-year-old survived strong winds, heavy rain and the
pressure of shooting for a wire-to-wire victory to card a final-
round one-over 73 and pick up the winner's cheque of 383,000
dollars.


Jacquelin, whose only other European Tour title came at the 2005
Madrid Open, finished the tournament at 10-under, two clear of
Dane Soren Kjeldsen, with Scot Simon Yates and Australian Scott
Hend a shot further back.


World number five Ernie Els, the top ranked player in tournament,
began the day five shots adrift of Jacquelin and the South
African could not make a charge, having to settle with an even-
par 72.
