A Bangladesh court has issued an arrest warrant for former prime
minister and opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed, wanted on
murder charges, an official said Sunday.


The warrant came as Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in London,
said she would attempt to board a plane for Dhaka later in the
day in defiance of efforts by the military-backed government to
bar her return and keep her in exile.


"The court has issued an arrest warrant against Sheikh Hasina on
the Paltan murder case," said Mohammad Shipu, a court official at
Dhaka metropolitan magistrates court.


It is alleged that Sheikh Hasina is responsible for killings at
Paltan, an area of the capital, where Awami League activists beat
at least four people to death last October.


The charges were filed against Sheikh Hasina earlier this month
while she was visiting relatives in the United States.


Although she vowed to fight the charges in person, the military-
backed government of the emergency-ruled country has barred her
from returning and informed airlines operating flights to
Bangladesh.


Aides, however, said that Sheikh Hasina would attempt to board a
British Airways flight at London's Heathrow airport later on
Sunday.


The government is attempting to exile Sheikh Hasina as well as
Khaleda Zia, the leader of the country's other main political
party, as part of a campaign to clean up Bangladesh's notoriously
corrupt political system.


Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led a coalition
government until last October.
