UEFA has discarded 1.6 million Euro 2008 ticket requests,
believing them to be destined for the black market, the
competition's commercial director Martin Kallen said Sunday.


Speaking in an interview with SonntagsZeitung, Kallen said only
8.7 million of the 10.3 million ticket requests made will take
part in the ticket draw.


The others, mostly multiple requests from the United States and
Norway, were considered to be destined for the black market.


Those lucky in the draw will be informed by the end of the month.
