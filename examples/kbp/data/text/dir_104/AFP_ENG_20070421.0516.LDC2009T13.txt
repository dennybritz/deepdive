China's women said a narrow win over a World Stars team had given
them a massive boost for the World Cup.


China snatched a 3-2 victory in the dying seconds against the
international side brimming with talent late on Saturday, giving
them new hope for the September tournament.


The World Cup hosts, runners-up in 1999, have slumped to ninth in
the rankings after a dismal run including four straight defeats
at the recent Algarve Cup.


Wang Haiming, who coached the side for the last time before newly
appointed Marika Domanski-Lyfors takes the reins, said the result
of the friendly was significant.


"It means a lot for the Chinese team and it helps our
confidence," he said.


"This was a good chance for us to get experience and learn how to
deal with mental stress.


"The game showed how we have improved. Of course we still have a
long way to go but we should get better over time."


China and the World Stars shared four headed goals in the first
half before Ji Ting's 90th-minute winner.


"This game will give us a lot of confidence for the World Cup in
September," said Liu Sa, who scored China's opener.


The match was a prelude to Sunday's World Cup draw, when 16
countries will be split into four groups for the September 10-30
tournament held across five Chinese cities.


China, Germany, the United States and Norway are seeded, with the
remaining teams -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark,
England, Ghana, Japan, New Zealand, North Korea, Nigeria and
Sweden -- all going into the pot.
