Two men and a youth have confessed to desecrating the gravestones
of French Muslim soldiers in a military cemetery in northeastern
France, the local prosecutor announced on Sunday.


The men, both aged 22, and a 16-year-old admitted carrying out
the attack for racist reasons, prosecutor Jean-Pierre Valensi
said.


The graves of 52 soldiers were daubed with swastikas and Nazi
slogans like "Heil Hitler" in the ossuary of the Notre Dame de
Lorette cemetery, France's biggest military graveyard, near the
town of Arras, where the remains of many thousands of soldiers
killed in World War I are buried.
