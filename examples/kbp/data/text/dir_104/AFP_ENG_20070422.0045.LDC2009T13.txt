Israel's Finance Minister Avraham Hirshson has decided to take a
three-month leave of absence amid a police probe into corruption
in a labour union he once headed, his lawyer said on Sunday.


"My client told the prime minister (Ehud Olmert) that he would
suspend himself from his duties as finance minister and member of
the government in order to be able to defend his honour," Yaakov
Weinroth told army radio.


Hirshson, of Olmert's centrist Kadima party, has been grilled by
police four times over the past several weeks over suspicions of
involvement in aggravated robbery and fraud, embezzlement,
obstruction of justice and conspiring to commit a crime.


Hirshson has denied the allegations.


In January, police confirmed media reports that a graft probe had
been launched against Hirshson, the latest in a string of Israeli
officials to face corruption charges.


The allegations are part of an investigation into embezzlement of
millions of dollars from the right-wing National Workers
Federation labour body.


Corruption probes and other scandals involving senior Israeli
officials have rocked the Jewish state in the past six months.


Among them have been several graft probes against Olmert and a
looming rape indictment against president Moshe Katsav, who has
since taken a leave of absence from the largely ceremonial post.
