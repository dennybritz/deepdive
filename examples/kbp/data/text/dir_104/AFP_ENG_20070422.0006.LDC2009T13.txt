A top Vietnamese official will visit Seoul this week to discuss
ways to curb illegal match-making as an increasing number of
South Korean bachelors find brides in Vietnam, news reports said
Sunday.


Ha Thi Khiet will visit from Monday to Thursday, Yonhap news
agency said, quoting the South Korean embassy in Hanoi.


She will have talks with South Korea's minister for gender
equality and family, Jang Ha-Jin, and other officials to discuss
ways to put an end to illegal match- making operations.


International marriages are legal in communist Vietnam but match-
making services for commercial gain are not.


Vietnam has become a popular destination for bachelors from South
Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere searching for a spouse, often on
week-long marriage tours that include medical checkups, visa
procedures and speedy honeymoons.


The marriage market has been fuelled by a traditional preference
for sons in parts of Asia, a trend exacerbated by sex-screening
technology for pregnant women, with has left proportionally more
bachelors fighting over fewer women.


According to the South Korean National Statistical Office, the
number of Vietnamese brides in South Korea totalled 10,131 in
2006, up 74 percent from the previous year, with most married to
farmers and fishermen.


In South Korea, thousands of agencies now offer marriage tours to
China, Vietnam and other Asian countries, often subsidised by
rural authorities battling declining populations.
