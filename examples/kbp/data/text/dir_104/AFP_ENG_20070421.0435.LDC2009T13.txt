Authorities in the west African state of Guinea have detained
scores of Asians trying to reach Spain by boat, sources told AFP.


"Nearly 100 Asians" are being held by police at Conakry's
cultural centre, a resident of the mining town of Kamsar, 300
kilometres (180 miles) north of the capital, said.


"They were trying to reach Spain by boat but were intercepted
today (Saturday)," he said, adding that the migrants were being
questioned.


An official of the Boke region, where Kamsar is located,
confirmed the detentions but did not give details.


"Police are investigating," he said.


No details were immediately available on the nationality of the
Asians, the circumstances surrounding their interception or the
type of boat used.


Citing other witnesses, the Kamsar resident said they were
Indians and Pakistanis.


They had boarded the boat at Kamsar but returned to Guinea after
they were detected by an unidentified patrol in international
waters.
