Five babies died Sunday after a fire broke out early morning in
an orphanage in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, officials said.


The blaze started in one room on the third floor of the orphanage
where six babies were sleeping.


"We rushed two firefighting engines to the orphanage after
receiving the call about thick smoke rising from there at 5:37 am
(0337 GMT)," firefighter Senad Vladovic told AFP.


Vladovic said the fire was burning in the room where the babies
were sleeping. Children from that floor had been evacuated and
rushed to hospital.


Vladovic said it was not been a major fire and that babies had
probably died from smoke inhalation.


"Twenty-three children, including two babies who were already
dead, arrived at the hospital this morning. One more baby died in
the hospital," a spokeswoman for the Sarajevo clinic, Biljana
Jandric, told AFP.


Later prosecutors said another two babies had died at the scene
of the fire.


Jandric said that two more babies were in critical condition,
while others were stable.


The Sarajevo orphanage is home to 110 children and all the babies
sleep on the third floor where the fire broke out.


Police said they were still investigating the cause of the fire.
