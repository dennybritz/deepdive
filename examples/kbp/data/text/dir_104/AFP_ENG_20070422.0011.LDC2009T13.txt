A show crocodile in a Chinese amusement park has been shot to
death after it dragged a nine-year-old schoolboy into its pond
and devoured him.


Several youths had climbed over the fence at the Yintan resort in
Beihai and were hitting animals with sticks and rocks when one
croc took hold of the boy's clothes and pulled him into the
water, the Beijing Morning Post said Sunday.


A swarm of up to 11 crocodiles then ate the boy, the report said.


The crocodiles are still being bred even though their
performances at the park were halted several years ago, it said.
