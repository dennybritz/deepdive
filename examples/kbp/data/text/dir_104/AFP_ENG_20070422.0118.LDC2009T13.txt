A ban on selling chicken in bird flu-hit areas of Yangon has been
lifted after three weeks passed with no new reported cases of the
virus, state media said Sunday.


Officials imposed restrictions on the transport and sale of
poultry, eggs and animal feed after the deadly H5N1 strain of
avian influenza was detected at seven poultry farms in military-
run Myanmar's biggest city, the New Light of Myanmar reported.


The discovery prompted the slaughter of 65,812 birds, hitting
farmers and vendors hard, but all the restrictions have now been
lifted, the newspaper said.


The paper said the country hoped to officially declare itself
bird-flu free within three months, and urged people to report any
suspicious bird deaths.


The international community, usually quick to criticise secretive
Myanmar, has praised the junta-run country for its quick response
to bird flu, which has killed 172 people worldwide.


Myanmar has not reported any human cases of bird flu.
