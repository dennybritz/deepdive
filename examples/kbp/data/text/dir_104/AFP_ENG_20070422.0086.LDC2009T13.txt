Two near simultaneous car bombs at a police station in Baghdad on
Sunday killed 10 people and wounded 75, security officials told
AFP.


Two of those killed in the co-ordinated attack on the Al-Bayaa
police station in southwest Baghdad were policemen, while 30
policemen were among the wounded, the officials said.


Insurgents have managed to set off bomb attacks in Baghdad
despite a massive security crackdown in the capital involving
nearly 80,000 US and Iraqi troops.
