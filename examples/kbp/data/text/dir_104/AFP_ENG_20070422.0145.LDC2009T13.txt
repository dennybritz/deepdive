Two men and a youth have confessed to desecrating the gravestones
of French Muslim soldiers in a military cemetery in northeastern
France, the local prosecutor announced on Sunday.


The men, both aged 22, and a 16-year-old admitted carrying out
the attack on Wednesday night for racist reasons, prosecutor
Jean-Pierre Valensi said.


He said their motivation was "somewhat confused, a mix of Nazi
and neo-Nazi and skinhead ideology, one of them said Hitler was
his idol."


The graves of 52 soldiers were daubed on with swastikas and Nazi
slogans like "Heil Hitler" in the ossuary of the Notre Dame de
Lorette cemetery, France's biggest military graveyard, near the
town of Arras, where the remains of many thousands of soldiers
killed in World War I are buried.


All three have been remanded in custody. The two adults will
appear in court in Arras on Wednesday, where they could face
being jailed for five years and fined 75,000 euros (102,000
dollars). The minor will be dealt with by a juvenile court.


The prosecutor said they all lived locally and had no previous
criminal convictions.
