An explosion in the rabbit population has "trashed" the World
Heritage listed Macquarie Island, which is home to endangered
penguins and albatrosses, the World Wide Fund for Nature said.


The conservation group is calling on the government to implement
a 25 million dollar (21 million US) strategy to eradicate
rabbits, rats and mice on the sub- Antarctic territory.


WWF spokesman Andreas Glanznig said it was possible that mice,
which have been shown to become carnivorous on an island in the
Atlantic, could evolve enough to threaten endangered bird species
on the remote scrap of land.


"It's a scary scenario but it's not outside the realm of
possibility," he said. But he added that rabbits posed the more
immediate threat.


"The rabbits are changing the whole ecosystem. The ecosystem is
literally falling apart," Glanznig told AFP. "The whole island
has been trashed."


Glanznig called on Canberra to take control of the island from
the Tasmanian government to put an end to the plague.


"(Macquarie Island) has got the highest protection under state,
federal and international law yet it's just allowed to be trashed
by rabbits," he said.


"Rabbits are now in plague proportions and they are eating out
all the island's vegetation."


The rabbits, which were introduced by sealers in the 1870s but
until recently had been kept in check by cats, have destroyed all
the vegetation holding the land together, causing dangerous
landslides, Glanznig said.
