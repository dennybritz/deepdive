Israeli troops early Sunday killed two Palestinian militants in
the West Bank town of Nablus after surrounding the house in which
they were hiding, Palestinian security sources said.


Fadel Nur, 23, and Amin Lubadi, 25, both members of the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigades, a violent offshoot of president Mahmud Abbas's
Fatah movement, were killed by Israeli fire, the sources said.


Troops surrounded the house they were hiding in and killed them
during heavy exchanges of fire, the sources said.


The Israeli army had no comment immediately available.


The deaths brought to 5,668 the overall toll since the eruption
of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the vast majority
of them Palestinians, according to an AFP count.


This incident follows one of the bloodiest days in recent months
in Israeli- Palestinian violence when six Palestinians, including
a teenaged bystander, were killed by Israeli fire in the West
Bank town of Jenin and the Gaza Strip.
