The Israeli cabinet on Sunday appointed David Cohen as new police
commissioner, replacing a predecessor who stepped down amid
scandal two months ago.


The cabinet approved Cohen's appointment unanimously, a senior
government official who was present at the meeting told AFP.


Cohen replaces Moshe Karadi, who stepped down in mid-February
after a board of inquiry chaired by a judge found that he had
mishandled a scandal linking officers in his department to an
Israeli crime family and recommended his dismissal.


The scandal dates back to September 1999 when police officer
turned criminal Tzahi Ben-Or, acting on behalf of an Israeli
crime family, murdered a rival crime lord while he lay in bed in
a Tel Aviv hospital.


Ben-Or was arrested during a botched burglary three months later
and confessed to the murder. Placed under house arrest, he
escaped to Mexico where he was subsequently murdered.


Prior to his appointment on Sunday, Cohen served as commander of
the police central district and is also a former chief of the
police intelligence branch.
