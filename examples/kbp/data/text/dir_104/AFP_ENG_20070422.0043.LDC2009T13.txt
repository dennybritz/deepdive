Israel's arch-foe Iran is still a long way from acquiring
technology necessary to produce nuclear weapons, Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert told public radio in an interview aired on Sunday.


"Iran is far from attaining the technology threshhold and this
country is not close to getting it, contrary to statements by its
leadership," he said.


Olmert also said that he preferred diplomacy in dealing with the
Islamic republic's controversial nuclear programme.


"I don't think that a military operation would ensure that Iran
doesn't get nuclear arms," he said.


"The enormous diplomatic efforts, with which Israel is
associated, are attaining their objective," he said.


"Iran is the biggest danger for us, but we shouldn't give in to
panic and hysteria, which result in nothing," he said.


The Jewish state, widely considered the sole if undeclared
nuclear power in the Middle East, considers Iran its arch-foe
following repeated calls by its President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for
Israel to be wiped off the map.


The UN Security Council has imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran
over its refusal to comply with demands issued last year that it
suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing work.


Israel and the West fear Iran's nuclear programme is aimed at
developing atomic weapons. Tehran insists it is solely for
civilian purposes.


In December, the chief of Israel's Mossad spy agency estimated
that Iran could have its first atomic weapon within three or four
years if its nuclear programme continues at its present pace.
