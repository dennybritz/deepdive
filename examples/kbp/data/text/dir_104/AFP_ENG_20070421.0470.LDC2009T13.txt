A man was wounded overnight when a bomb exploded outside a tax
office in this seaside town on the island of Corsica, as France
prepared to vote in presidential elections, police and judicial
officials said Sunday.


The life of the 22-year-old man, possibly a passer-by who
suffered injuries to his face, was not in danger, sources added.


Another attack, 10 minutes earlier, damaged the Bastia office of
maritime affairs but no one was hurt in this blast.


The attacks came a day after an island police post was targeted
in a shooting incident and within hours of a major rally in
Corsica's main town Ajaccio called by separatist movements and
condemning "French colonial rule".


Five police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrators.


Corsica has been plagued by more than 30 years of low-level
violence waged by separatists opposed to French rule.
