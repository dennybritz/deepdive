A homemade bomb blew up three video and music shops in a market
in northwest Pakistan where hardliners believe the businesses are
un-Islamic, police said Sunday.


The blast happened late Saturday in Swabi, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) northeast of Peshawar, the capital of the deeply
conservative North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan,
they said.


"It destroyed one shop and partially damaged two others, but
there were no casualties as the market was closed," local police
chief Fazal Elahi Badshah told AFP.


The blast occurred in the Gulzada Market which has some 80 shops
of CDs, DVDs, tape recorders and also houses groups of bands
usually hired to perform in wedding ceremonies, residents said.


Islamic hardliners who say music and movies are un-Islamic have
dubbed the shopping complex the "Hell market," they said, adding
that some shopkeepers had received warning letters in the past.


The province has seen previous attacks on video and music shops
blamed on extremists emulating the ultra-orthodox Taliban, who
ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001.


There has been growing concern about the "Talibanisation" of
Pakistan and the introduction of Islamic sharia law in areas
along the Afghan border where last month two men and a woman were
stoned and shot to death for adultery.


The Taliban outlawed music and most other forms when they were in
power.
