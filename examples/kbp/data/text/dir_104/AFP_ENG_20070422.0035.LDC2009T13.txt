A Bangladesh court has issued a warrant for the arrest of
opposition Awami league leader and former prime minister Sheikh
Hasina Wajed on murder allegations, an official said Sunday.


"The court has issued an arrest warrant against Sheikh Hasina on
the Paltan murder case," said Mohammad Shipu, a court official at
Dhaka metropolitan magistrates court.


It is alleged that Sheikh Hasina, currently abroad, is
responsible for killings at Paltan, an area of the capital, where
Awami League activists beat at least four people to death last
October.
