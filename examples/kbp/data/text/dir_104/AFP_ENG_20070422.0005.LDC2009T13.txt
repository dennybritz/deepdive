Chinese police have arrested three people suspected of setting up
a fraudulent website to sell bogus tickets to the Beijing 2008
Olympic Games, state press said Sunday.


The website was offering the online purchase of Games tickets and
other "fradulent ticketing information," Xinhua news agency
reported.


Police have confiscated computers and bank cards being used by
the site and are stepping up their investigation into the fraud,
it added.


The mad scramble for Olympics tickets began last Sunday with
organisers putting on sale more than seven million seats for the
world's premier sporting event.


Nearly 60 percent of saleable tickets will be reserved for
residents of China, while the rest of the world will get 25
percent, said Rong Jun, director of the organising committee's
ticketing department.


The remainder will got to schools, college students and young
athletes as part of an educational programme, he said.


Organisers said high-tech methods had been employed to deter
forgers and that each ticket would be identified with individual
purchasers and have its own embedded computer chip.
