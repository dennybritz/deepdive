Tamil Tiger rebels and government forces fought two gunbattles in
Sri Lanka's restive north and east leaving at least six rebels
killed, the defence ministry said Sunday.


Gunmen of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) clashed
with troops at Vavuniya, 260 kilometres (160 miles) north of
Colombo, on Saturday drawing fire from security forces, the
ministry said.


It said five Tiger rebels were killed in the confrontation but
did not say if troops suffered any casualties.


In a similar clash in the eastern district of Ampara, a Tiger
rebel was shot dead by Special Task Force police commandos on
Saturday, the ministry said.


There was no immediate reaction from the Tigers, who have been
fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils from the
majority Sinhalese island.


More than 4,000 people have been killed since December 2005 in a
new wave of fighting despite a truce in place since February
2002. The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
