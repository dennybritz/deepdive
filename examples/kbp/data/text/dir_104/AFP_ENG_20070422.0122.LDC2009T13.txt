A leading Canadian think-tank said Sunday it had handed its
annual award to Anson Chan, Hong Kong's former deputy leader who
has become a champion of democracy in the Chinese territory.


Chan received the Fraser Institute's T Patrick Boyle Founder's
Award, which is given to individuals who exemplify the
institute's libertarian values.


Chan's tenure as deputy leader of Hong Kong spanned the 1997
handover of sovereignty when the city reverted to Chinese rule.


She resigned soon after amid disagreements with former leader
Tung Chee-hwa and made a surprise return to the public eye in
2005 when she emerged as proponent of democracy here.


She has since joined anti-government marches and formed a group
of intellectuals to propose reform of Hong Kong's political
system from one where China effectively chooses city leaders to
one where they are elected by popular vote.


The Fraser Institute champions free market economics and personal
freedom, and famously rates the openness of each country's
economy in an annual list, which Hong Kong regularly tops.
