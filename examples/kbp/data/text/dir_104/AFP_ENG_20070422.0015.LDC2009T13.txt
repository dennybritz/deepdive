Studies by a Thai scientist have found that a native herb used
here for breast enhancement could help prevent the bone disease
osteoporosis, local media reported Sunday.


Tests on laboratory mice over three months found that pueraria
mirifica, known as kwao krua in Thailand, helped prevent bone
thinning in females, the Bangkok Post newspaper said.


Nontakorn Urasopon of Chulalongkorn University published the
study in European journal Maturitas, it said.


The report said the herb contains a high amount of
phytoestrogens, a chemical produced by plants which has similar
properties to oestrogen, the female hormone commonly used to
treat osteoporosis.


"Oestrogen has been well documented to prevent bone loss," the
newspaper quoted Nontakorn as saying. "However receiving high
amounts of the hormone over a long period of time could also pose
health risks.


"That is why we would like to do more research and find a
substitute from a natural source that reduced health problems in
ageing people without producing side-effects."


Pueraria mirifica is found in Thailand and neighbouring Myanmar,
and is sold as a hormone replacement, anti-aging and breast
enhancement therapy.


The Bangkok Post said that Nontakorn and his team would now test
pueraria mirifica on monkeys ahead on a human trial, with
conclusive research taking another five years.


Osteoporosis is a debilitating and painful bone thinning disease
which leads to fractures and is particularly common in post-
menopausal women and men over the age of 50.
