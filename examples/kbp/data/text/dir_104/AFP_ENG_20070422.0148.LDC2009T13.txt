Thirty-one percent of French voters had turned out by midday to
vote in the first round of the country's presidential election,


The turnout was running 10 percentage points higher than in the
last presidential poll in 2002.


Five years ago more than half the electorate either abstained or
voted for the extreme left and right candidates, allowing veteran
far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen to qualify for the second
round of the vote in which he was beaten by Jacques Chirac.


Around 44.5 million registered voters -- an increase of 3.4
million on 2002 -- were eligible Sunday to choose a successor to
Chirac, 74, who steps down next month after leading the country
for 12 years.
