Prince Albert II of Monaco arrived in Japan on Sunday for a
three-day visit to attend a travelling exhibition of memorabilia
of his late mother, Hollywood star Grace Kelly.


The prince will also meet with Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko, and hold talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on ways to
further expand bilateral ties, the Japanese foreign ministry
said.


The 49-year-old prince's visit follows the establishment of
formal diplomatic ties between Monaco and Japan in December.


The Grace Kelly exhibition has toured Japan since December, with
items ranging from her wardrobe and accessories to a collection
of pressed flowers belonging to the princess, who died in a car
accident in 1982 at the age of 52.


Japan could not post an ambassador to the seaside Mediterranean
principality for years due to a 1918 treaty that put Monaco under
limited French protection.


But the treaty was replaced by a new agreement in December 2005
which allows foreign envoys in Monaco which, with 32,000
residents, is the world's smallest state after the Vatican.
