Spanish tenor Placido Domingo cancelled a concert at the 11th
hour on Saturday evening because of hoarseness.


A few minutes before the recital was due to begin, Domingo, 66,
appeared on stage to announce that he was suffering from
"persistent hoarseness" and would be unable to sing.


Only around 2,000 spectators had turned up for the concert in the
Atlantic Pavillon, which has a capacity of 10,000.
