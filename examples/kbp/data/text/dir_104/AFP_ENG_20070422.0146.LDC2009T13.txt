Israeli Arab MP Azmi Bishara, a virulent critic of Israeli
policies toward the Palestinians who is under a police inquiry,
tendered his resignation from parliament in Cairo Sunday.


"I have decided to resign. According to law, you can tender
resignations either in an embassy or the Knesset," he told the
Al-Jazeera satellite news channel.


The Israeli embassy in Cairo confirmed that the fiery lawmaker
submitted his resignation during a meeting with the ambassador.


"Mr Bishara was here today at the embassy and met Ambassador
Shalom Cohen. He submitted his resignation to the ambassador,"
embassy political advisor and spokesman Benny Sharoni told AFP.
