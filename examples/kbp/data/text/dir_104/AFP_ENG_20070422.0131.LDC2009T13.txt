An air and sea search for a 22-year-old Briton who went missing
from an overnight ferry between Portsmouth and Saint Malo has
been called off, maritime officials said here Sunday.


"The search was suspended on Saturday evening and has not resumed
this morning," a spokesman said, adding that the regional
prosecutor's office had been charged with establishing the
circumstances of the man's disappearance.


The man, last seen in the early hours of Saturday, was travelling
with three friends who raised the alarm after he did not show up
when the ferry docked in Saint Malo.
