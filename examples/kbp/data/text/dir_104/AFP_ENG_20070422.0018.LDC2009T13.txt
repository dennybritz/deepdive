An independent autopsy found no signs of torture on a Maldives
dissident who died shortly after being released from custody,
officials here said Sunday.


The body of Hussein Salah was flown to Sri Lanka on Friday for a
medical examination following allegations that he had been killed
while in police custody and his body dumped in a lagoon.


Sri Lanka's chief judicial medical officer, LBL de Alwis, said
the man had drowned and ruled out torture.


Attempts by the Maldivian authorities last week to bury the
victim in Male without an autopsy led to angry protests. The
government in the Maldives archipelago sent the body here on
Friday following a request by his family.


The opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) accused police of
killing the man.


The MDP is leading a campaign against Maldivian President Maumoon
Abdul Gayoom, who is currently the longest serving president in
Asia, elected in 1978.


Political parties were allowed in the Maldives for the first time
in June 2005 in line with reforms announced by Gayoom.


The Maldives, home to around 300,000 Sunni Muslims, is yet to
hold multi-party elections and Gayoom's opponents have accused
him of clinging to power in one of Asia's most exotic tourist
destinations.
