Former Portugal star striker Eusebio may need to undergo surgery
on his carotid arteries, doctors in the Hopistal of Light in
Lisbon said Sunday.


The 65-year-old is suffering from a bloackage to the arteries
that carry blood to the brain.


"After conducting some tests we have found some obstructions to
the internal carotid arteries. We believe an eventual operation
will be necessary," said Germano do Carmo, a doctor at the
hospital.


"It would require a delicate but uncomplicated operation."


According to the hospital director Jose Roquette, Eusebio is well
and not complaining of anything.


The 'Black Panther', as he was known in his playing days, hails
originally from former Portuguese colony Mozambique and lit up
the 1966 World Cup, scoring nine goals as Portugal reached the
semi-finals.


He was a major star for Benifca during the 1960s and 1970s,
winning 10 titles, five cups and one European Cup, whilst also
playing in three other finals of Europe's top competition.
