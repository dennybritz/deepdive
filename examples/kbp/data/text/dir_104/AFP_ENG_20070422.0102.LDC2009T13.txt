New Zealand and India are to explore the prospects of a free
trade pact while acknowledging there are "significant obstacles"
ahead, New Zealand Trade Minister Phil Goff said Sunday.


The announcement came following talks here with his Indian
counterpart Kamal Nath.


"While achieving a free trade agreement with India would require
us to overcome significant obstacles, agreement in principle to
conduct a study into what such an agreement would mean for both
of our countries would be a good start," Goff said.


Trade between the two counties is small but growing, with New
Zealand exports to India reaching 355 million dollars (262
million US) in the year to February 2007.


"That trade still only represents a fraction of its potential,"
Goff said.


"New Zealand-India two-way trade at less than 650 million dollars
compares with nearly seven billion dollars in our two-way trade
with China."


Goff said he had raised his concerns with Nath about significant
barriers New Zealand goods faced entering India.


"Tariffs on key New Zealand food and beverage items are high and
food safety controls, which exceed international standards, can
prevent trade in areas such as dairy and meat."


Progress on a study is expected to be made at a joint trade
commission meeting between the two countries likely to be held in
September.
