South Korea has agreed to provide 400,000 tonnes of rice to North
Korea starting in late May, the two Koreas said Sunday.


"Out of humanitarian considerations and brotherly love as the
same nation, the South will provide 400,000 tonnes of rice loan
to the North," a  joint statement issued at the end of bilateral
economic cooperation talks said.


The 10-point statement did not mention the South's demand that
the North must start moves to freeze its nuclear weapons
programmes under a February deal.


But South Korean delegates made it clear to the North Korean side
that the rice aid would be conditional on the North taking steps
towards denuclearisation, media pool reports said.
