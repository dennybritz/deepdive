Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki left on Sunday for Cairo to discuss
preparations for next month's international conference on Iraq to
be held in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, his office
said.


Maliki will travel on to Kuwait after the Egypt stopover, a
statement from his office said.


Ministers from the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, the Group of Eight and Iraq's neighbours are
set to meet in Sharm el- Sheikh on May 3-4 to find ways to end
Iraq's bloodshed.


"The prime minister will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak focusing on bilateral relations ... and the horizons of
regional cooperation to curb the terrorism and support Iraq's
unity," the statement said.


"Talks will focus particularly on ways to make a success of the
conferences on the International Compact and of Iraq's neighbours
that will be held back to back to support Iraq."


Following the regional security conference, there will be talks
on the United Nations backed "International Compact", a framework
agreement for foreign donors to contribute to Iraqi
reconstruction and development projects.


Maliki will be accompanied by Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani,
his Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rafie al-Issawi and
National Security Advisor Muwaffaq al-Rubaie.
