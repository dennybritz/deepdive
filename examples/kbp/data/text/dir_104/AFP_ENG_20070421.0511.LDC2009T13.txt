Israeli troops early Sunday killed two Palestinian militants in
the West Bank town of Nablus after surrounding the house in which
they were hiding, Palestinian security sources said.


Fadel Nur, 23, and Amin Lubadi, 25, both members of the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigades, a violent offshoot of president Mahmud Abbas's
Fatah movement, were killed by Israeli fire, the sources said.


Troops surrounded the house they were hiding in and killed them
during heavy exchanges of fire, the sources said.


The Israeli army had no comment immediately available.
