Malaysia has won an extention to keep hosting a Formula One Grand
Prix until 2015, despite concerns about its course and talk of a
bid from Singapore, the head of the Sepang circuit said Sunday.


"We have secured a five-year extension from 2011 to 2015,"
Mokhzani Mahathir, chairman of the Sepang International Circuit
(SIC), told AFP.


The announcement comes just weeks after Formula One boss took SIC
to task, saying the Sepang circuit was "shabby" and needed to be
updated.


Mokhzani said there were plans for a major upgrade that would
include building an "automotive-related theme park with bike and
go-kart tracks."
