Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapakse will head to the West
Indies if the country makes it to the cricket World Cup finals
this week, his aides said Sunday.


Rajapakse, who returned to the island early Sunday after a four-
day visit to Italy and the Vatican, plans to travel to the
Caribbean if Sri Lanka beats New Zealand in their semi-final
match Tuesday, an aide said.


The president had earlier shot down moves by several politicians
and cricket officials to have a Caribbean cruise at state
expense.


Few Sri Lankans are splashing out between 700,000 and one million
rupees (6,500 to 9,300 dollars) to watch their team play this
week.
