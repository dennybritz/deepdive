Tracy McGrady came alive just in time to help Yao Ming lead the
Houston Rockets to an 84-75 victory over Utah in their National
Basketball Association playoff series opener.


Yao had 28 points and 13 rebounds, and McGrady scored 22 of his
23 points in the second half as the Rockets took the lead in the
best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series.


Rafer Alston collected nine points, 11 rebounds and eight assist
for Houston, which overcame a lackluster 39-percent shooting
effort.


The Rockets trailed 42-33 at halftime, largely because of the
lack of offensive production by McGrady.


The Jazz held him to just one point on 0-for-6 shooting - a
career postseason first-half low.


However, McGrady regained his All-Star form in the third period,
scoring 16 points - highlighted by a deep pull-up jumper from the
top of the key with 10 seconds left to cap an 18-4 burst and help
Houston take a 59-53 lead into the decisive quarter.


Utah pulled within 65-63 on Matt Harpring's driving layup at the
8:27 mark.  But the Rockets pulled away for good as Alston and
Luther Head hit back-to-back 3-pointers, sparking an impressive
15-3 surge to push the lead to 80-66 with 3:33 remaining.


Two quick 3-pointers by Derek Fisher helped Utah cut the deficit
to 80-74 with 32 seconds left, but McGrady split a pair of free
throws to seal the victory.


All-Star Carlos Boozer struggled with just 11 points but did pull
down 12 rebounds for the Jazz, who fell to 13-14 all-time in the
postseason against the Rockets.
