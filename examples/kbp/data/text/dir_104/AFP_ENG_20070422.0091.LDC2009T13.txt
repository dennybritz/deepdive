Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday defended the sanctity of life "in all
its phases" during a visit to a hospital in Pavia, a town in
northern Italy.


"The hospital is a place that one could say is 'sacred' in a way,
where you see at firsthand the fragility of human nature but also
the potential and the enormous resources of human genius and
technology at the service of life," the pope told hospital staff.


Technological advances, however, should "always be accompanied by
attention to the promotion of... the basic values of respect and
defence of life in all its phases," he added.


Speaking to patients, the pontiffe said "suffering is repugnant
to the human soul," but added: "When it is accepted with love and
enlightened by faith, it becomes a means of purification and
redemption for the entire world."


The pope, who rarely leaves the Vatican, on Saturday began a two-
day visit to Lombardy with a stop in the renaissance town of
Vigevano where he concelebrated an open-air mass with bishops of
the Lombardy diocese.


His programme here Sunday includes another open-air mass, a
meeting with cultural figures, and a vespers evening church
service.


Benedict will also visit the tomb of Saint Augustine, a fifth-
century theologian considered a father of the Latin Church whom
the pope quotes frequently in his writings and speeches.


The trip is Benedict's fourth in Italy since the start of his
papacy two years ago.


The pontiff, who turned 80 last week, will travel to Brazil next
month.
