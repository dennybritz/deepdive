Malaysia's long-haul budget carrier AirAsia X has decided to buy
15 Airbus A330-300, selecting the plane over the Boeing 777-200,
an executive familiar with the deal said on Sunday.


"AirAsia X decided to pick the A330-300 because Airbus came with
a better commercial deal and the delivery of the aircraft will be
faster," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. He said the
official announcement would come Monday.


AirAsia X was unveiled in January by low-cost aviation pioneer
Tony Fernandes, who launched AirAsia as a regional budget carrier
more than five years ago.


The new carrier will be operated by Fly Asian Express (FAX),
which currently operates rural air services on Borneo island. It
expects to carry half a million passengers in its first year of
operation.
