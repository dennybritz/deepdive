A US Peace Corps worker whose body was found in a shallow grave
in the northern Philippines last week was beaten to death, media
reports Sunday quoted police as saying.


Julia Campbell, 40, died from severe beatings to the head and
face, the Philippine Star reported.


"The cause of death involves multiple blunt traumatic injuries of
the head," the daily said, quoting police medicial officer Chief
Inspector Mamerto Bernabe.


A a full report will be submitted to the Philippine National
Police within a week, the paper said.


Campbell's remains were turned over to the Peace Corps on
Saturday after the autopsy, which was observed by US forensic
experts.


Police are looking for a man who lived close to where Campbell's
body was found in the northern mountain town of Batad.


A 10-year-old witness saw the suspect loitering at the site where
the victim was last seen, Superintendent Joseph Adnol said
Friday.


Although the suspect has vanished from his home, "police here...
already have an idea of where we can find him but we're
withholding that information," he said.


The police are investigating reports that the suspect was seen
carrying Campbell's knapsack after she went missing.


President Gloria Arroyo's spokesman, Ignacio Bunye, said she was
"saddened by the death."


A former journalist, Campbell was on holiday and had come to the
Batad area to see its world famous rice terraces. She had been
working as a teacher in the eastern city of Legaspi.
