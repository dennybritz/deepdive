Polls opened Sunday in France's hotly contested presidential
election that heralds the transfer of power to a new generation
of political leaders.


Right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy and socialist Segolene Royal
were favourites to reach the all-important second round on May 6,
according to the last opinion polls issued Friday.


Some 44.5 million registered voters -- an increase of 3.4 million
on 2002 -- are choosing a successor to Jacques Chirac, 74, who
steps down next month after leading the country for 12 years.
