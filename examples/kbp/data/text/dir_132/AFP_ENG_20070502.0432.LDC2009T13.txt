Uzbekistan on Wednesday defended the jailing of a rights
activist, saying she had threatened the state by financing non-
governmental organisations with foreign money.


Umida Niyazova, 32, was sentenced on Tuesday to seven years in
jail for illegally crossing the border, smuggling and
distributing publications threatening public order on May 1.


New York-based Human Rights Watch and other rights groups
condemned the verdict as politically motivated.


"Niyazova had financed different unregistered non-governmental
organisations and rights groups operating in Uzbekistan...
receiving money from a number of foreign diplomatic
representative offices," said a foreign ministry statement.


"These facts could be considered as an attempt to interfere in
the internal affairs of a sovereign state."


On Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) added its voice to the chorus of disapproval saying
the ruling was unfair and far too harsh.


OSCE representative on media freedom Miklos Harazsti said in a
statement released in Vienna, where the organisation is based,
that the sentence was "especially cruel for someone who did
nothing but exercised her right to inform society.


"I hope the case can be dismissed in appeal, and freedom of
reporting even on controversial issues restored," he said.
