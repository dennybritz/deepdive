Former world number one Ivan Lendl revealed on Wednesday he does
not have a single racket left from his playing career.


The American of Czech origin told German magazine Stern that he
has given away all of the rackets from a glittering career which
saw him win 21 million dollars and 94 ATP tour titles.


"I do not have any tennis racket left," said the 47-year-old, who
retired in 1994.


"I gave them all away. When I want to play, I have to borrow
one."
