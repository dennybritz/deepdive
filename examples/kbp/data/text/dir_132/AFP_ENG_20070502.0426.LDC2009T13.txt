Strong economic growth has given Indians the capacity to buy more
cars and electronic goods than ever, a national survey said on
Wednesday.


For instance, the number of households owning TV sets in urban
areas rose to 66.1 percent in 2004-05 from 40.5 per cent in
1993-94, according to the National Sample Survey Organisation
(NSSO).


In rural districts -- the areas of greatest poverty in India --
the number of TV-owning households jumped by nearly 19 percentage
points to 25.6 percent in 2004-05 from 7.0 percent in 1993-94.


"The survey results reflect the country's expanding economy," the
NSSO said in its latest survey, sponsored by India's ministry of
statistics.


The economy has expanded by an average of more than 8.5 percent
annually for the past four years.


In urban areas, households possessing cars or jeeps have gone up
to 4.6 percent in 2004-05 from 1.2 percent in 1993-94. Similarly,
households owning a motorcycle or scooter have increased to 26.0
per cent from 11.6 percent.


In urban areas, the percentage of families owning a refrigerator
increased to 31.9 percent from 12.3 per cent in 1993-94.


Refrigerators have also made inroads into rural households, with
about 4.4 percent possessing a fridge in 2004-05 as against 0.9
percent in 1993-94.


Commerce Minister Kamal Nath has said 25 million Indians annually
join the country's middle class, estimated at around 300 million
people, thanks to the high economic growth.
