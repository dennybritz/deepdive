Six-nation talks are underway Wednesday in London on Iran's
controversial nuclear programme, Britain's Foreign Office said.


Officials from the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States -- plus Germany were meeting to discuss their next moves
on Tehran's uranium enrichment programme.


Iran is under UN sanctions due to nuclear activities that have
fuelled fears that it is seeking to build atomic weapons.


"It's part of a pattern of exchanges that are ongoing all the
time, except that in this case it's face to face," a Foreign
Office spokesman told AFP.


"These are the political directors discussing essentially tactics
and reviewing where we are."


He said the diplomats were hearing from European Union foreign
policy chief Javier Solana's representative about his talks with
Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani, which took place in
Ankara on Wednesday and Thursday last week.


"They are hearing from the Russian and Chinese representatives
about how they see the way ahead," the spokesman added.


Earlier, senior US official Nicholas Burns said Iran must enter
negotiations over its nuclear programme or face increasing
international isolation.


Solana has called for the United States to open a "channel of
communication" with Iran on all subjects.


Washington broke off relations with Tehran in 1980.
