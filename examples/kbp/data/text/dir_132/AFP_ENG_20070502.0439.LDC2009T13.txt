After local favourite Tommy Haas' first round exit from the ATP
tournament in Munich, his German compatriots were left to battle
their way into the quarter- finals on Wednesday.


Alexander Waske, ranked 121 in the world, struggled early on in
his second round match before the 31-year-old eventually defeated
qualifier Daniel Brands 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5), to reach the last
eight.


"You've got to hand it to the boy, in a few more years, he'll be
a real threat," Waske said of his teenage opponent.


"He's a good guy with his head in the right place," Waske added
of the 19-year- old who is ranked 370 in the world and was
playing in Munich for the first time.


Waske faces Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in the last eight, and the
2006 Australian Open finalist took his time to find his rhythm
before beating qualifier Matthias Bachinger 6-7 (6-8), 6-2, 6-4.
