Six-time winners AC Milan reached the Champions League final here
on Wednesday beating Manchester United 3-0 in their semi-final
second leg match and winning 5-2 on aggregate.


Goals by Kaka - his third of the two legged match - Clarence
Seedorf and Gilardino ensured Milan reached their third Champions
League final in five seasons and denied the English Premiership
of having their first ever all- England final.


Instead Milan - who have won six of their 10 previous finals -
have the chance of avenging the 2005 final defeat to Liverpool
when they meet in Athens on May 23.
