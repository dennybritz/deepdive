The US Food and Drug Administration raised concerns Wednesday
about the link between antidepressant medications and suicidal
behavior in young adults.


The government drug regulator recommended that producers of some
three dozen antidepressants add warnings to labels pointing out
the increased risks of "suicidality" -- suicidal thinking and
behavior -- in people 18-24, in the first stages of their
treatment.


An announcement from the agency cited studies showing "a slight
increase in suicidality for patients taking antidepressants in
early treatment for most of the medications."


In 2005 the FDA asked drug manufacturers to add a similar warning
regarding children and adolescents prescribed antidepressants.


However, it said in the statement Wednesday that the same drugs
do not increase suicidal behavior in people over 24 and, indeed,
among those over 65, the tendency is reduced.
