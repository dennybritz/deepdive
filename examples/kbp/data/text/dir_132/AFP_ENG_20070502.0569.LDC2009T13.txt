An adventurous tabby took an unexpected trip this week, after
slyly crawling into her keeper's luggage and clearing lax
Canadian airport security, local media said Wednesday.


Mary Martell unwittingly traveled 1,400 kilometers (870 miles)
from Saint John Airport on Canada's Atlantic coast all the way to
Toronto, then to Niagara-on- the-Lake by car with the live cat in
her suitcase.


She told public broadcaster CBC the bag was scanned at the
airport, but she was not stopped and it was eventually loaded
into the airplane's cargo bay.


"They had asked me, when they put ... the luggage through the
X-ray, whether I had a turkey," she said.


"(Airport security) kept going back and forth with (the
suitcase)," Martell said. "I was adamant: 'Look, I have no
turkey.'"


Martell said she only discovered Ginger, the family pet, when she
opened her luggage in a hotel room, after the three-hour journey.
The cat had apparently snuck into a bag while Martell was
packing.
