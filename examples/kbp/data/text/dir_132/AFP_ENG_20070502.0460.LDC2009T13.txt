Ghana's agriculture minister on Wednesday reported the West
African country's first case of the deadly H5N1 strain of the
bird flu virus in poultry.


Minister Ernest Debrah told journalists the case was "detected
April 24 near Tema", a port city to the east of the capital
Accra.


The area has been sealed off and some 1,700 birds have been
culled, he said.
