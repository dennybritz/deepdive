A flurry of news on mergers and takeovers helped US stocks keep
upward momentum Wednesday as media stocks led the upside and blue
chips rose to yet another record.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 76.06 points (0.58
percent) to 13,212.20 at the closing bell, as the blue-chip index
posted its 17th record close this year and 21st gain in 24 days.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite increased 26.31 points (1.04
percent) to 2,557.84 and the broad-market Standard & Poor's
500 index rose 9.65 points (0.65 percent) to a preliminary close
of 1,495.95.


A driving factor was "renewed attention to media stocks," said
Joseph Hargett at Schaeffer's Investment Research after the hefty
five-billion-dollar bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for the
publisher of the Wall Street Journal.


The surprise bid has lifted other media stocks and fueled
speculation about more merger and takeover efforts in the sector.


Hargett added there were also "rumors circulating that NYSE
Euronext could make a bid for the International Securities
Exchange effectively crashing Deutsche Boerse's 2.8-billion-
dollar takeover of the American exchange."


Also in takeover news, Cablevision Systems signed a deal that
would transfer the big cable TV operator to a private entity
headed by the founding Dolan family for 22 billion dollars.


Sentiment was helped by news that US factory orders rose a
stronger-than- expected 3.1 percent, helping ease concerns about
softening economic conditions.
