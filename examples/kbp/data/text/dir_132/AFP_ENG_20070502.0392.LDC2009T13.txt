Police in Mauritania have seized a record 625 kilogrammes of
hashish that arrived in the country aboard a small airplane,
police said Wednesday.


One person, a Moroccan, was arrested in connection with the
seizure. The drugs, which amounted to 1,375 pounds, had been
stored in 21 separate crates and had come from Venezuela.


It was not clear where the plane had left from.


It landed illegally on the tarmac at the airport in northern
Nouadhibou despite it being closed because of renovation work.
The plane took off after unloading its haul.


Western Africa, especially Guinea-Bissau, has increasingly become
a transit point in recent years for South American drugs destined
for Europe.
