Germany's Nico Rosberg on Wednesday was hospitalised following a
crash in private testing in Barcelona, though his Williams team
said he had emerged unscathed.


Rosberg, the son of former world champion Keke and ninth in the
new season standings, wrecked the side and front of his FW29 car
after the crash at turn 10 which came barely 36 hours after the
team's test driver Kazuki Nakajima damaged his chassis in a
shunt.


A Williams spokesman confirmed Rosberg, who began his season with
a seventh- place in Australia for his only points to date, was
not hurt.


But he added the team would now not take part in a session
scheduled for Thursday which had been slated after rain ruined
Tuesday's practice.
