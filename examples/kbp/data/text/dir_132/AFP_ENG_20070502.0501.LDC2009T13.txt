Seven new EU countries plan to hire a lobbyist in the United
States in a bid to persuade lawmakers there to eliminate visa
entry requirements, Slovakia's foreign minister said Wednesday.


The seven countries, including three Baltic states and four from
central Europe, will share costs for the lobbyist, Jan Kubis told
journalists.


Slovakians need a visa to enter the United States, but Americans
do not need one for travel to Slovakia.


The requirement has been a thorn in relations between the United
States and Slovakia, and Bratislava has tried for several months
to convince Washington to remove it.


Besides Slovakia, countries participating in hiring the lobbyist
are Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania.
