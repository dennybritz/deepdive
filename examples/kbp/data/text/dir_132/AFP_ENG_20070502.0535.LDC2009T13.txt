A train carrying solid rocket booster parts for NASA's space
shuttle program derailed in Alabama, injuring six people, but
none of the material spilled, officials said.


"There was a train wreck, six injuries," a spokesman for the
Alabama Emergency Management Agency said.


The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said the
train was carrying parts for the solid fuel rocket boosters used
in space shuttles.


NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said the train was traveling from
Utah, where the segments are manufactured, to the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida where the space shuttles are launched.


He said the parts were destined for shuttles to be launched in
October and December.


Twin solid rocket boosters are used to give most of a space
shuttles thrust on liftoff. The solid fuel they use is very
stable and has a high ignition point.


Alabama media said the train derailed in a swampy area after a
bridge tressel collapsed.
