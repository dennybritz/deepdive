Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said on Wednesday that he
respects Israel for issuing a damning report on last year's war
against his Shiite guerrillas in Lebanon.


"It is worth every respect when an inquiry commission ... is
appointed by (Prime Minister Ehud) Olmert ... and it condemns
Olmert," Nasrallah said at a book fair in Beirut's southern
suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold.


"I will not stand here to rejoice at the misfortunes of Olmert,
(Defence Minister Amir) Peretz and (former army chief Dan)
Halutz," he said.


"One can only respect the butchers' enemy leaders ... when they
work day and night for their prisoners," he added.


On Monday, the inquiry accused the three men of "serious failure"
in handling the 34-day war sparked by Hezbollah's capture of two
Israeli soldiers.


"They study their defeat in order to learn from it," unlike Arab
states that "do not probe, do not ask, do not form inquiry
commissions ... as if nothing has happened," Nasrallah said.


"It is a pity that we have to wait for an Israeli commission to
confirm our victory.


"The first important result of the commission is that it has
settled -- officially and for good -- the issue of victory and
defeat," Nasrallah said.


"The commission has admitted the defeat. The word 'defeat' has
appeared more than 100 times" in its interim report.


The publishing of the damning report prompted Israeli Foreign
Minister Tzipi Livni, a longtime ally of Olmert, to call on
Wednesday for the premier to quit.


Israeli media reported that Peretz was preparing to step down.
