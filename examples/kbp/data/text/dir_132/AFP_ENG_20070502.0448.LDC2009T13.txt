The Belgian oil sector began reducing production on Wednesday
amid threats of strike action, the BRAFCO industry association
said.


Wage negotiations between unions and big international oil groups
such as ExxonMobil and Total active in Antwerp failed to lead to
an agreement, BRAFCO official Olivier Neirynck told AFP.


Christian trade union CSC has warned of a strike if an agreement
is not found by May 9 while Socialist union FGTB has threatened
to down tools from May 20 if a deal is not struck.


"Refineries can't be shut down all of a sudden, so companies have
slowly started to reduce their (refining) activity," Neirynck
said.


ExxonMobil, Total and the Belgian Refining Federation all
declined to comment when contacted by AFP.


Belgium's refiners are mostly based near the northern port city
of Antwerp and pump 700,000 barrels of product per day.


"We've asked our associates to build up stocks in order to make
up for a halt in production if a strike happens," Neirynck said.


He said that fuelling stations should be able to get by for a
week or two before being hit by shortages.
