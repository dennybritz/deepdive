A man suspected of helping a terrorist mastermind plot attacks in
Britain and the United States effectively admitted his guilt
after he was arrested, a London court heard Wednesday.


After his arrest in 2004, Qaisar Shaffi, 28, was allowed to make
a telephone call prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw told the high-
security Woolwich Crown Court.


In that call he "effectively admitted his part in the terrorist
planning", the lawyer said.


"During a tearful conversation with his father he was heard to
say: 'Dad, I don't know when I'll be out. I won't be out soon.


"'I might not be out for five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20
years, ever, I don't know.'", Laidlaw told the court.


Shaffi, 28, is one of seven men accused of conspiring with Dhiren
Barot, a Muslim convert who was jailed for life last November
after pleading guilty to planning synchronised attacks in Britain
and the United States.


Shaffi is the only one of the accused to have pleaded not guilty.


In the United States, Barot plotted to target the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, as well as the New
York Stock Exchange, the Citigroup headquarters in Manhattan and
the Prudential building in Newark, New Jersey.


Laidlaw told Woolwich Crown Court that Shaffi was one of seven
"trusted" lieutenants who aided Barot.


"When (Shaffi) went to the US, he was knowingly assisting Barot
with reconnaissance for murderous terrorist attacks," Laidlaw
said.


Searches of Shaffi's house uncovered pages of a book, the
Terrorist Handbook, referring to chemicals, explosives and
recipes for producing explosions, Laidlaw said.


The six other men, who pleaded guilty, have been remanded in
custody and are expected to be sentenced in June.
