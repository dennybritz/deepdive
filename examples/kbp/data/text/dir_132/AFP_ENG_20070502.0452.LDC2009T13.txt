Former England defender Sol Campbell has been ruled out of
Portsmouth's remaining two Premiership clashes in a setback for
the south coast club's chances of clinching a UEFA Cup spot for
next season.


Campbell, who has successfully resurrected his career at Pompey
after a difficult 2005/06 season with Arsenal, is suffering from
an Achilles tendon problem which is expected to require surgery.


There was better news for manager Harry Redknapp however on the
coaching front following confirmation that his assistant, Tony
Adams, will stay at the club for at least another season.


Adams had indicated that he would be looking for his own club to
manage next season but has had a change of heart after helping
Portsmouth to their current position.


"The fans here have been fantastic, I want to stay part of this,"
Adams said. "I think Harry wants me here and ... if we can come
to some arrangement then why not?"


Portsmouth, who face Everton on Saturday and then Arsenal at home
in their final fixture on May 13, are in a six-team battle for
the three available UEFA Cup places with Everton, Bolton,
Tottenham, Reading and Blackburn.


David James has been voted player of the year by team-mates and
fans. The goalkeeper, 36, picked up the twin-award during a
ceremony at the city's Guild Hall.
