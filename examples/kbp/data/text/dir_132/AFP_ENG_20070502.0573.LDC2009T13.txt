Two men on Wednesday robbed 1.8 million dollars from an armored
truck outside a check-cashing store in Hialeah Gardens, just
west of Miami, the FBI said in a statement.


The theft took place as a messenger got out of the truck to
deliver a bag containing the cash.


"A subject approached the messenger and pointed what felt like a
handgun to his back," the FBI said in a statement.


"The subject told the messenger in Spanish to walk over to a dark
blue Mitsubishi, four-door car, and throw the money in the back
seat."


The suspect tried to take the messenger's gun, but failed and got
into the car, where another man was sitting behind the wheel.


"The messenger fired three shots as the car drove away," the
statement said.
