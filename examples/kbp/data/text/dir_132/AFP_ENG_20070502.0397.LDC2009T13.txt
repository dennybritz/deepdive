Two newborn babies whose frozen bodies were found in a French
couple's freezer in South Korea were suffocated to death,
according to autopsy results revealed on Wednesday.


French national Veronique Courjault, 38, has confessed to killing
three babies to whom she gave birth between 1999 and 2003,
including the two found by her husband Jean-Louis in their home
in Seoul last July.


She is in jail in France under criminal investigation for murder,
the first stage before formal charges are brought.


Philippe Varin, state prosecutor of the western French city of
Tours, told reporters one of the babies was suffocated through a
piece of cloth, while the other suffocated after his face was
crushed, also through soft fabric.


He said the autopsy findings were not fully consistent with
Courjault's statements to police, in which she claimed to have
strangled both infants, and that she could still ask for a
counter-expertise.


South Korean tests had not conclusively established the cause of
the babies' deaths.


After initially denying any knowledge of the babies, Courjault in
October admitted killing them and an earlier infant, whom she
says she suffocated and burned in the family fireplace in 1999.


Her confession followed DNA tests by police from both countries,
which showed the couple were the babies' parents.


Her husband Jean-Louis, who worked for the US car parts company
Delphi in South Korea, says he knew nothing about the infants. He
has also been placed under investigation in France but has not
been detained.
