The mother of the governor-elect of southern Nigeria's oil-rich
Rivers State has been released by the armed men who kidnapped her
earlier this week, a state government spokesman said Wednesday.


Wahia Omehia, the mother of Celestine Omehia, was released late
Tuesday night, Emmanuel Okah told AFP.


"No demands were made. She was released unconditionally," he
said.


The gunman abducted her Monday night from her village, Ubima,
near the state capital Port Harcourt.


Although her abductors have still not been identified, police
sources in Port Harcourt said the abductors were people who had
worked for the governor-elect during the election campaign and
who had not been paid.
