The foreign ministers of Greece and Tunisia agreed on Wednesday
to boost bilateral ties between their countries, ahead of an
accord on avoiding double taxation.


"We examined the possibilities of increasing our bilateral
cooperation and proceeding to regular high-level exchanges,"
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said after talks here with
her Tunisian counterpart Abdelwalab Abdallah.


She announced that an accord would be signed in Tunis within two
weeks on a double taxation deal.


The two ministers were also due to discuss the Middle East and
the situation in the Mediterranean region during their meeting
here.


Greece favours a "more substantial" relationship between Tunisia
and the European Union within the framework of European-
Mediterranean cooperation, the Greek minister added.


For his part, Abdallah appealed to Greek tourists to visit
Tunisia, just "one hour and 50 minutes by airplane" from Athens.
"Tunisia is not a competitor destination to Greece," he said.


Abdallah had earlier been received by Greek President Karolos
Papoulias to whom he passed on a "message of friendship' from
Tunisian counterpart Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
