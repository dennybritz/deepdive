President George W. Bush said Wednesday that his bitter feud with
Democrats over Iraq had entered a "new phase" and hinted he would
accept "benchmarks" for progress -- but not a withdrawal
timetable.


One day after vetoing legislation tying war funding to a pull-out
timeline, "that phase of the process is now over and a new phase
has begun," said Bush, who was to host his top Democratic foes at
the White House.


"I am confident that, with good will on both sides, that we can
move on both sides that we can move beyond political statements
and agree on a bill that gives our troops the funds and the
flexibility they need to do the job that we have asked them to
do," he said.


Bush, an unpopular president waging an unpopular war, was to
welcome top lawmakers to the White House later for talks on the
way forward after he vetoed a 124-billion-dollar bill to fund the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.


Amid increasing talk of imposing "benchmarks" but no withdrawal
timetable on the Baghdad government, Bush indicated his support
for setting standards for progress while rejecting any
"precipitous withdrawal."


"Iraq's leaders still have got a lot to do, don't get me wrong",
he told a friendly audience at a national builders' meeting here.


"They've got a lot more to do and the United States expects them
to do it, just like I expect them to remain courageous and just
like they expect us to keep our word," he said.
