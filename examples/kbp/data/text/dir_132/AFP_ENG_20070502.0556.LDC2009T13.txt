Ten days after Nigeria's controversial presidential election, no
petition had been filed with the tribunal set up to hear
complaints over the conduct of the poll, state media reported
Wednesday.


NAN agency said there were also no complaints filed at tribunals
with jurisdiction over regional and legislative elections in the
Federal Capital Territory, the region that includes the capital
Abuja.


Nigeria's electoral law says complaints must be filed within 30
days from the date of the declaration of the election result.


Results of the presidential poll, in which the ruling party
candidate Umaru Yar'Adua was declared winner, were announced
April 23.


Last month's polls have been widely criticised for falling short
of international standards.


Foreign and domestic observers have condemned them as being
marred by fraud and violence, while Nigeria's electoral
commission said that 50 people including 39 police officers were
killed during state elections alone.


European Union observers monitoring the polls put the estimated
death toll for the two voting rounds together at 200.
