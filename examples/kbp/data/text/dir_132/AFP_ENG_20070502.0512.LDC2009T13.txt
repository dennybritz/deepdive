Japan's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Midori Matsushima was
in Cuba Wednesday for bilateral talks, in a rare visit by a
Japanese official to the communist-run Caribbean nation.


"We will address reforms of the UN Security Council, the
situation in North Korea, including the human rights situation in
that country," Matsushima said ahead of talks with Cuban Foreign
Minister Felipe Perez Roque.


"There are respectful and cordial relations between Cuba and
Japan," said Perez Roque.


"There is a structured political dialogue at the level of foreign
ministries, which is conducted annually," he said.


Roque said bilateral trade, which amounted to 300 million
dollars, would grow as the Cuban economy improves. "There is an
economic relationship that has historical bases and that in
recent years has gained new momentum," he said.


"There is a wide field of possibilities in the economic sector,
in particular sectors like biotechnology where first joint deals
are starting to emerge," the Cuban official said.


Matsushima said a Japanese company had decided to buy a
biotechnical drug from Cuba, but gave no details.


During her stay in Cuba, Matsushima visited installations of the
Cuban- Venezuelan Operation Miracle, which runs a free eye
surgery aid program. She also toured the Center for Molecular
Engineering in Havana.


Matsushima is the most senior Japanese official to visit Cuba to
discuss bilateral issues in the past 10 years.
