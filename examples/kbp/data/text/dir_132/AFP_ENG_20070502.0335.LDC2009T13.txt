The chairman of Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC) and former trade unionist, Isaac Matongo, died on
Wednesday aged 60, a party spokesman said.


"The MDC sadly announces the death of (Isaac) Matongo who passed
away this morning (Wednesday) in his sleep around 3 am," Nelson
Chamisa said in a statement.


"Matongo's death comes as a blow not only to the party but to the
nation at large, particularly considering the challenges that our
country is facing. His experience, wisdom and vision will be
irreplaceable," he said.


The cause of death was not disclosed.


Matongo, who was born on March 12, 1947, in the southern town of
Masvingo, played a pivotal role in the formation of the MDC in
1999.


He was elected founding national chairman of the MDC, a position
he held until his death, Chamisa said.


He had been elected vice-president of the National Engineering
Workers' Union in 1988 and served as vice-president of the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions together with the then
secretary-general, Morgan Tsvangirai, now leader of the MDC.
