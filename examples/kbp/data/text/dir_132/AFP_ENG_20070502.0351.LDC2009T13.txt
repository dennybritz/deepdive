Five soldiers were killed in an ambush while they were conducting
an anti-drug operation in northern Mexico, officials said.


The five were killed during operations in Michoacan state, 350
kilometers (218 miles) northeast of Mexico City, said Lieutenant
Colonel Binicio Prea.


Drug-related violence has killed more than 600 people in Mexico
so far this year.


Mexico is the main transit route for cocaine smuggled into the
United States and is a main supplier of marijuana and
methamphetamine.
