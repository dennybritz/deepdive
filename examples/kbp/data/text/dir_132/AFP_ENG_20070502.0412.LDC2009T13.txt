German striker Miroslav Klose has ended talk of a possible switch
to Barcelona or Bayern Munich by announcing on Wednesday he will
stay with Werder Bremen until June 2008.


The 28-year-old, top scorer at last summer's World Cup, has been
the subject of intense recent speculation with Munich-based
newspaper, the Suddeutsche Zeitung, reporting on Wednesday Klose
would move to Bayern Munich this summer.


But Bremen have announced the 67-times capped Klose will honour
his contract and stay with them after the player met with club
officials at the northern German club on Wednesday.


"We are glad that the decision has finally been made," said
Bremen general manager Klaus Allofs.


"We only wish the matter could have been resolved earlier, but
now we can concentrate on the final few games of the season and
trying to win the league."


The Suddeutsche Zeitung reported both Klose and Italian World Cup
winner Luca Toni, from Fiorentina, had agreed terms with Bayern
who are seeking to strengthen their squad after a dismal season.


While Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello sport reported
Toni's switch as a done deal last weekend, neither the player nor
the club have confirmed the move.


"The rumour kitchen is bubbling slowly," was all Bayern Munich
coach Ottmar Hitzfeld would say.


Toni's agent, Tullio Tinti, denied any contract had been signed
between the 29 -year-old striker and Bayern. No official
announcement is likely to be made before the Italian league
concludes on May 27.
