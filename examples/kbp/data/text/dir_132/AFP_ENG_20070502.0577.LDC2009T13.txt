French Socialist Segolene Royal launched a stinging attack on
right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy in a crucial presidential debate on
Wednesday, accusing him of "political immorality."


Reacting to comments in which Sarkozy called for handicapped
children to be guaranteed a place in school, Royal said that he
had "reached a pinnacle of political immorality".


Royal accused his governnent of dismantling Socialist education
measures on handicapped children, accusing him of exploiting the
issue, "with a tear in your eye."


Sarkozy, who remained calm throughout the attack, retorted
sharply: "I would never have spoken to you this way" -- to which
Royal fired back: "Because I don't lie."


Wrapping up the explosive exchange, Sarkozy said: "I don't
question your sincerity, don't question my morality... You lose
your temper very easily."


Four days before the election, more than half the country's adult
population was estimated to be watching the televised
confrontation, seen as crucial to the outcome of the election.
