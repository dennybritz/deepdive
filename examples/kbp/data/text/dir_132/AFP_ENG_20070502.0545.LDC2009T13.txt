Nigeria's president-elect, Umaru Yar'Adua, said Wednesday that he
will, on taking office, examine last month's polls that have been
widely criticised for falling short of international standards.


"We all have a stake in ensuring a lasting democratic culture and
raising the conduct of the electoral process," Yar'Adua said at a
ceremony officially finalizing the results of the April 21
presidential poll.


"We will .. examine as a matter of urgency the last elections and
find ways and means by which all players within the system would
improve their conduct so that we raise the standard ... of our
general elections," Yar'Adua said.


Foreign and domestic observers alike have condemned the two-stage
polls as being marred by fraud and violence.


The electoral commission itself admitted that 50 people including
39 police officers were killed during the state elections alone.


European Union observers monitoring the polls put the estimated
death toll for the two rounds together at 200.


Last week, in his first public address after the results were
announced the president-elect, who was the ruling party's
candidate, had defended the polls, saying that some people
believed they were the "best elections Nigeria has held".


A coalition of opposition parties and civil society groups had
scheduled a mass protest on the flawed polls to coincide with the
workers day on Tuesday but the plan flopped in the face of
threats by the police to teargas any protesters.


Yar'Adua is due to be sworn in on May 29 when President Olusegun
Obasanjo is expected to complete his two-term eight years in
office.
