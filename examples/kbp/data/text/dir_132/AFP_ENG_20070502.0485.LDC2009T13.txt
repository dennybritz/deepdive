Japan's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Midori Matsushima was
in Cuba Wednesday for bilateral talks in a rare visit by a
Japanese official to the communist-run Caribbean nation.


"We will address reforms of the UN Security Council, the
situation in North Korea, including human rights in that
country," Matsushima said ahead of talks with Cuban Foreign
Minister Felipe Perez Roque.


"There are respectful and cordial relations between Cuba and
Japan," said Perez Roque.


He said bilateral trade, which amounted to 300 million dollars,
would grow as the Cuban economy improves.
