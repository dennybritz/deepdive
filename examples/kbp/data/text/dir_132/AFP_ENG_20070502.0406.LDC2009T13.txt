Democratic leaders said Wedednesday a vote on a new Iraq war
budget in the House of Representatives could come within two
weeks, after President George W. Bush vetoed their troop
withdrawal timetable.


Democratic Majority leader Steny Hoyer said despite their
showdown with Bush for control of the war, the party would not
cut off the funding spigot for US troops in the war-torn nation.


"My hope is within the next two weeks," Hoyer told reporters when
asked how long new legislation would take to go through the
House. "We will not allow this to languish."


Such a schedule would allow the Senate to take up its own version
and send the new emergency bill to fund the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan to Bush at the end of May, he said.
