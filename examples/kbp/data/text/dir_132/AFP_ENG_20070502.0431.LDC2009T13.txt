A UN conference considering ways to improve the nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty suspended its work Wednesday following
Iranian objections to a call for full compliance with the treaty.


Conference chairman Japanese ambassador Yukiya Amano told the
meeting that Thursday morning's session had been cancelled but
would resume in the afternoon.


"I am still conducting intensive consultations and and I need
some more time. I thank you for your understanding," Amano told
the meeting in Vienna of the 189-nation NPT.


Diplomats have said they feared the Vienna meeting could descend
into procedural wrangling as happened at the last review
conference in New York in May 2005.


Iran is under United Nations sanctions due to nuclear activities
defying UN resolutions and which had fuelled fears that it seeks
atomic weapons.


Iranian ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh told reporters Wednesday:
"Our position has not changed" in opposing the agenda item, which
states there will be discussion on "reaffirming the need for full
compliance with the treaty."


On Monday, Soltanieh surprised the opening session when he
insisted that the agenda item could "create disputes by creating
too much focus on one country. We don't want a direction given"
against Iran.
