A top official with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's party
resigned from his post on Wednesday in protest at the premier's
refusal to quit over a damning Lebanon war report, sources told
AFP.


Avigdor Itzhaki, who headed the parliamentary bloc of centrist
Kadima, resigned during a meeting of the party's 29 MPs,
parliamentary sources said.
