Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech has described his team's defeat in
the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool on penalties as
the lowest point in his career.


"I am tired and disappointed. A semi-final defeat in such a
competition always hurts. It is the biggest disappointment in my
career," the Czech national keeper said in an interview with
local media.


Five-time European champions Liverpool sealed their ticket for
the May 23 Champions League final with a 4-1 win on penalties
after Tuesday's semi-final tie ended 1-1 on aggregate.


"During the penalty shoot-out I have always succeeded until now
in stopping at least two of the opponents' attempts. This time I
had no chance," Cech added.


"Liverpool have a string of players who can score from penalties.
It was only the choice of (Bolo) Zenden that surprised me," Cech
said in reference to the home side's choice of Dutch
international midfielder as the first penalty-taker.


"Life goes on. You cannot do anything. Time will clearly help."
