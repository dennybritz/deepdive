Rape charges against South African football international Jabu
Mahlangu were dropped Wednesday on the grounds of insufficient
evidence, police said.


The 26-year-old Bafana Bafana star had been charged earlier in
the day with raping a 19-year-old woman after he handed himself
in at a local police station, accompanied by his lawyers.


However police spokeswoman Captain Cheryl Engelbrecht told the
Sapa news agency that the charges had been formally dropped when
he appeared at the Johannesburg high court.


"The case was thrown out because of insufficient evidence so he's
a free man," she said.


The midfielder has been playing recently for the Johannesburg-
based Orlando Pirates after being sacked by the Austrian club SV
Mattersburg following a night out drinking with friends.


Mahlangu represented the national team at the 2002 World Cup and
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney but he has been left out of
more recent squads.
