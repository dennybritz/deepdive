A conservative Afghan senator who was prime minister for a few
weeks in 1992 was assassinated outside his home in Kabul late
Wednesday, police said.


Abdul Sabur Farid Kuhestani, aged in his mid-fifties, was shot
dead by unknown assailants who had set up an ambush for him, the
head of the city's criminal investigation department, Alishah
Paktiawal, told AFP.


Witnesses heard three shots fired at the prominent
parliamentarian as he left his home to go to a mosque, the
Pahjwak Afghan News agency reported.


Kuhestani was prime minister for just over a month from July 1992
in the chaos of the civil war that erupted between the commanders
of groups that had forced the withdrawal of the Soviet army in a
10-year resistance struggle.


He was a member of the radical Islamist Hezb-i-Islami Afghanistan
party led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who succeeded him as prime
minister.


Hekmatyar's anti-Western party is among the groups, which include
the Taliban, involved in an insurgency against the government of
President Hamid Karzai.


The motive for the senator's killing was not clear.


In January this year another parliamentarian, Mawlawi Islam
Mohammadi, was shot dead as he left his house in Kabul to walk to
a local mosque.


Mohammadi had been Taliban governor of Bamiyan province when the
Islamists blew up two 1,500-year-old statues of Buddha months
before the Taliban government was toppled by a US-led coalition
in late 2001.
