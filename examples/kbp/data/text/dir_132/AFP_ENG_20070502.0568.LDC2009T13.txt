Human Rights Watch called on Sudan's government Wednesday to hand
over two key figures in the Darfur bloodshed to be tried by the
International Criminal Court.


In a statement following the ICC's first arrest warrants over the
Darfur conflict, New York-based HRW said Sudan is now obligated
to turn over State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs Ahmed Haroun
and Janjaweed militia leader Ali Kosheib, aka Ali Mohammed Ali.


The two face a long list of 42 and 50 charges of crimes against
humanity and war crimes respectively, including torture, mass
rape and the forced displacement of entire villages during a
series of attacks in western Darfur in 2003 and 2004.


"Today's ICC decision is an important step for victims in
Darfur," said Richard Dicker, HRW's International Justice Program
director.


"The (UN) Security Council has obligated Sudan to cooperate with
the ICC, and Sudanese officials should stop flouting their
responsibility to comply," said Dicker.


"The council needs to monitor Sudan's conduct and insist that it
hands over the suspects as required."
