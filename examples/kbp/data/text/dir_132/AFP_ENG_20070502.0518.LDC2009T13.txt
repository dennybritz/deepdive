Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday failed
in a formal bid to override President George W. Bush's veto of
their planned timelines from troop withdrawals from Iraq.


As expected, Democrats could not amass the two-thirds majority
needed to trump Bush's move on Tuesday for the war, which has
killed more than 3,350 US soldiers and is increasingly unpopular
among Americans.


The final vote was 222 to 203 in favor of the Democratic move.


The Senate, where even tighter electoral mathematics will hamper
the Democrats, was not expected to hold a formal vote on the veto
of the bill which would have required troop withdrawals to start
by October.
