Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora said Wednesday he regretted
an Israeli inquiry into last year's war had failed to learn the
real lesson -- that military offensives do not bring security.


"Israel's offensives against Lebanon have not brought security"
for the Jewish state, he said in reference to successive major
operations against its northern neighbour in 1978, 1982, 1993,
1996, and 2006.


"The Winograd report failed to draw the lesson ... These wars
have shown that they do not guarantee the security of Israelis
and they do not lead to peace."


The Winograd commission of inquiry's interim report published on
Monday accused Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of "serious
failure in exercising judgement, responsibility and prudence," of
acting "hastily" and personally contributing to "over-ambitious"
and unfeasible war aims.


But it did not criticise the principle of the war itself despite
the huge destruction and loss of life it entailed.


An estimated 1,200 people died in Lebanon, most of them
civilians, as well as 162 Israelis, most of them soldiers, after
Israel retaliated for a deadly cross- border raid by Shiite
militant group Hezbollah in which it captured two soldiers.


Lebanon's Western-backed premier said peace would only come to
the region once Israel accepted a five-year-old Arab peace
initiative offering it full normalisation of relations in return
for a full withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967.


"A just peace will only be established through the Arab peace
initiative and UN resolutions," he said.
