The Romanian parliament on Wednesday approved the stationing of
US forces at four bases in the southeastern European country.


Even before the vote, backed by 257 deputies with one against
while 29 abstained, a US contingent had already begun exercises
at one of the Romanian bases.


Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu was quoted by the Mediafax news
agency as saying that the vote would "contribute towards
consolidating relations with the United States."


But he added that "the activities of American forces on and from
Romanian territory will be the result of consultations and joint
decisions."


Bucharest and Washington signed an agreement in December 2005 to
open four US bases in Romania which joined NATO the previous year
and the European Union in January.


The accord allows for some 1,500 US troops to be rotated between
sites at Mihail Kogalniceanu and Babadag in the southeast,
Smardan in the south and Cincu in central Romania.


An initial series of US-Romanian exercises -- with about 200 US
troops and more than 250 Romanian troops participating -- began
on April 20 at Kogalniceanu and is due to end Friday.


Kogalniceanu was also used as a US base from February to June
2003 for operations related to the Iraq war.
