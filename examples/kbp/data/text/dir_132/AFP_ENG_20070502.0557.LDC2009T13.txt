The head of UNESCO on Wednesday hailed Ecuadoran President Rafael
Correa for imposing flight and construction restrictions aimed at
protecting the threatened ecosystem of the Galapagos Islands.


"President Correa took a very important measure to confront the
problems in the Galapagos by declaring them in a state of
emergency," said Koichiro Matsuura, who heads the UN Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).


Correa recently issued orders to restrict tourist traffic,
overhead flights and residence permits on the islands located
hundreds of kilometers (miles) from Ecuador's coast, which are
listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.


Experts say tourism, overpopulation and non-native species are
threatening the ecosystem of the archipelago famed for its vast
number of endemic species and which inspired British naturalist
Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.


The 8,000 square kilometer (3,088 square mile) islands and 45,000
square kilometers (17,374 square miles) of surrounding waters are
home to giant tortoises, penguins, sharks, Darwin finches, marine
iguanas, and sea lions, as well as rare trees and insects.


They are also visited by 100,000 tourists each year.
