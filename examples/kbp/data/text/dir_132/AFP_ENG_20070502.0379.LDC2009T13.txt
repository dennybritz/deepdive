Austrians will be able to vote in all elections from the tender
age of 16 under a new law adopted by ministers on Wednesday.


The new voting age, the lowest in the European Union, is one of
several reforms promised by the coalition of social democrats and
conservatives that took power in January.


The minimum age to stand for election has also been lowered to
18, except for presidential candidates who must be at least 35
years old.


The reforms are expected to be approved by parliament before the
summer.


Elsewhere, the government established postal votes for those
electors who live abroad, and extended the term of the
legislature from four to five years.


Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer, a social democrat, said that with
the new reforms Austria "has taken a great step forward in
democratic progress."


The conservative Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Wilhelm
Molterer, who was originally opposed to lowering the voting age,
praised the introduction of postal voting and the extension of
lawmakers' terms.


"We have modernised the right to vote," he said.


Most of Austria's political parties were in favour of lowering
the voting age, which is now below the legal age of majority of
18, and it was a key election campaign demand by the opposition
Green party.
