Vandals have attacked the grave of Janos Kadar, the country's
last communist leader, prying open the coffin and possibly
stealing his remains, a Budapest police spokesman Endre Kormos
said Wednesday.


"The marble top of the grave of Janos Kadar and his wife was
removed and the earth was dug out. The coffin was pried open,"
Kormos said.


"Police are in the process of lifting out the entire coffin and a
medical examination will be conducted to see if any of the bones
are missing, which may be the case," Kormos said.


A graffiti reading "killer and traitor cannot rest in holy
ground" was daubed on the nearby communist workers' pantheon.


In a statement, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany condemned the
"appalling, inhumane and cowardly act".


Kadar, who ruled Hungary for more than three decades, was
installed as the leader of communist Hungary by the leadership in
Moscow after Soviet tanks crushed the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising.


Although he initially spearheaded a crackdown on supporters of
the uprising, Kadar later became known for his relatively liberal
economic policies.


The higher standard of living under his "goulash communism"
compared favourably with those in the more hardline regimes in
the Soviet bloc.


He remains a controversial figure, with many in Hungary still
nostalgic for the period basic economic needs taken care of by
the state and jobs were provided for everyone, although political
freedom was stifled.


Kadar died on July 6, 1989, less than a year before the country's
first multiparty elections.
