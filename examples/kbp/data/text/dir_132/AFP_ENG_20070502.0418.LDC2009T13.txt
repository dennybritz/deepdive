US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Iraqi Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki Wednesday as officials began preparatory
consultations ahead of a landmark two- day conference on Iraq.


The two went into talks almost immediately after Rice arrived in
the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.


Their talks come after Washington demanded an explanation from
Maliki, a Shiite Islamist, on reports that Sunni army generals
had been purged by some of his close aides.


"In fact it is a question that we've asked of the Iraqi
government through the ambassador and I'm certain that it's a
question that will come up," Rice said before her meeting with
Maliki.


"But I know that Prime Minister Maliki has been very concerned to
try and have his generals have the authority to do what they need
to do," she added.


The Washington Post reported on Monday that some of Maliki's top
aides were involved in firing high-ranking army and police
officials who tried to rein in Shiite militias, and having some
of them arrested.


Rice was due to meet later Wednesday with UN Secretary General
Ban Ki-moon and her new Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, who was
named last week.
