Sierra Leone's national football team has been refused visas to
travel to Britain for friendly matches with a British side,
sporting sources said Wednesday.


A 20-strong contingent of players and officials was due to have
travelled to London next Monday for an encounter with British
League One team Leyton Orient.


But only two players and the team manager, Ibrahim Mansaray were
granted visas, sources told AFP.


The British high commission (embassy) here confirmed turning down
the visa applications but gave no reasons.


Last year 14 Sierra Leonean athletes disappeared during
competition from the Commonwealth Games village in Melbourne,
Australia, but later handed themselves over to immigration
seeking asylum arguing they risked persecution if returned to
their impoverished west African country.


Three years ago almost the entire junior national football team
vanished in Finland during the FIFA World Cup.


Sierra Leone football officials said the planned series of
matches in Britain were to be "warming up sessions" in view of
qualifying games lined up next month with Togo and Ghana for the
2008 African Cup of Nations.
