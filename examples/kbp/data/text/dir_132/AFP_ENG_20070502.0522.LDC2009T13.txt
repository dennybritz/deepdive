US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates has written to Poland's
prime minister to apologise after his plane was prevented from
flying over Iraq, a news agency reported Wednesday.


Gates said in the letter that officials would learn lessons from
the incident and ensure that it does not happen again, said
Polish government spokesman Jan Dziedziczak, cited by PAP agency.


The plane carrying Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski on a working
visit to Qatar and Kuwait on Saturday was barred from flying over
Iraq for security reasons.


An official in Kaczynski's cabinet had said air traffic control
for one of Iraq's internal zones did not approve the flight, so
it turned back and landed in Ankara. After a six-hour wait, the
premier decided to put off his visit and the aircraft returned to
Warsaw.


Kaczynski, accompanied by his defence and economy ministers, had
hoped to discuss cooperation in the energy and naval production
sectors while in Qatar and Kuwait.


Warsaw, which has backed Washington since the start of the US-led
invasion of Iraq in March 2003, has 900 soldiers there. Twenty-
five Polish soldiers and journalists have since died in the
conflict.
