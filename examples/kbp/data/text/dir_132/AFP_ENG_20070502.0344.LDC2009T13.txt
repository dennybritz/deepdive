Saudi Arabia refused to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-
Maliki because it believes he is deepening the Shiite-Sunni
sectarian conflict in Iraq, a Riyadh- based Arab diplomat said on
Wednesday.


King Abdullah declined to meet Maliki before a conference on Iraq
opening Thursday in Egypt because Riyadh "believes he entrenched
sectarian divisions in the political process in Iraq," the
diplomat told AFP, requesting anonymity.


The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Abdullah refused to
receive Maliki because he was skeptical of Maliki's Shiite-
dominated government.


The next day, the White House urged the Saudi monarch to meet
with Maliki, saying it was in Riyadh's long-term national
security interest to do so as a neighbour of Iraq.


Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said the Post's report was
"not true." He acknowledged a requested visit had been denied,
but said this was because a suitable timing could not be agreed.


The Arab diplomat said Saudi Arabia, the region's Sunni
heavyweight, had informed Washington of its "reservations" about
Maliki's policies.


It had previously refused to see him head the Iraqi delegation at
the annual Arab summit it hosted at the end of March, when
President Jalal Talabani led Iraq's team.


Opening the summit, the king, whose country is a close US ally,
slammed the "illegitimate foreign occupation" of Iraq. Saudi
leaders had previously criticised US policy in Iraq but never
termed its presence as "illegitimate."
