International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo Rato refused Wednesday
to react to Venezuela's decision to withdraw from the
institution, saying he had yet to receive an official request
from Caracas.


The IMF and World Bank have yet to comment on leftist Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez's announcement Monday that he was pulling
his country out of the global financial institutions.


"I have not yet received any official request. I think I'm not
entitled to react on a such serious matter until I receive an
official request," Rato told reporters when asked about Chavez's
announcement.


Chavez said Monday he ordered Finance Minister Rodrigo Cabezas to
begin proceedings to withdraw Venezuela from the global lender
bodies, calling them "tools of US imperialism" and claiming they
are dominated since their conception by the United States and
Europe.


Venezuela has proposed to create a Bank of the South as an
alternative to the two Washington-based organizations.
