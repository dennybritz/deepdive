After battling security forces for a decade, Nepal's Maoist
former rebels said Wednesday they face a new enemy in the UN-
monitored camps where they are confined -- snakes.


"At least 700 snakes were killed by People's Liberation Army
(PLA) fighters at a cantonment in Kailali in far western Nepal
during April alone," Ananta, the deputy commander of the Maoist
army, told AFP.


Around 31,000 former guerrillas have been registered by the
United Nations in 28 camps around the country as a crucial part
of a peace deal reached late last year between the Maoists and
the government.


But the former rebels have frequently complained that conditions
in the camps are dismal.


"Our comrades are living in miserable conditions. Generally, they
are housed in buildings that have thatched roofs and no cement
walls," said Ananta, who goes by one name.


Rebel leader Prachanda said Tuesday that camp conditions were
among the reasons the Maoists announced a series of mass protests
for later this month.


"The PLA has to stay awake all night just to kill the snakes.
These are the kinds of conditions our army is facing, and the
government is not serious about improving the conditions," he
said.


The ultra leftists launched their "People's War" in western Nepal
in 1996. However, they now say they have renounced violence and
will work within a democratic system.


At least 13,000 people had been killed in the conflict by the
time the government and Maoists signed the peace deal last year.
