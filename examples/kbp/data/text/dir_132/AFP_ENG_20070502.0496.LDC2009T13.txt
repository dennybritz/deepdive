Early general elections to end the political crisis in Turkey
will be held on July 22, nearly a month later than originally
suggested by the ruling party, parliament's constitutional
committe decided Wednesday.


The committee's decision will have to be voted into law by the
parliament to become official, which should be a simple formality
since all parties represented in the house favour the snap vote.


The date was determined by Turkey's Electoral Council, which is
responsible for organising elections, as the earliest possible
date for a "healthy" vote to take place.


The governing Justice and Development Party of Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan had earlier on Wednesday suggested June 24
for the vote, which was originally scheduled for November 4.
