A train carrying solid rocket fuel derailed in Alabama, injuring
six people, but none of the fuel spilled, the southern US state's
Emergency Management Agency said.


"There was a train wreck, six injuries," a spokesman for the
agency said.


He said the train was transporting solid rocket fuel for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA,) but that
"there was no spillage."


Alabama's WBRC television said the crash occurred after a bridge
tressel collapsed as the train was crossing.
