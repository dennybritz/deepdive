Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said on Wednesday that he
respects Israel for issuing a damning report on last year's war
against his Shiite guerrillas in Lebanon.


"It is worth every respect when an inquiry commission ... is
appointed by (Israeli Prime Minister Ehud) Olmert ... and it
condemns Olmert," Nasrallah at a book fair in Beirut's southern
suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold.


"I will not stand here to rejoice at the misfortunes of Olmert,
(Defence Minister Amir) Peretz and (former army chief Dan)
Halutz," he said.


"One can only respect the butchers' enemy leaders ... when they
work day and night for their prisoners," he added.


On Monday, the inquiry accused Olmert, Peretz, Halutz and
Israel's top brass of "serious failure" in handling the 34-day
war sparked by Hezbollah's capture of two Israeli soldiers.


"They study their defeat in order to learn from it," said
Nasrallah.


On Monday, just hours after the report was released, Hezbollah's
chief for southern Lebanon, Nabil Qaouk, hailed what he called
"an admission of Israel's historic defeat in the face of the
fighters of Hezbollah".
