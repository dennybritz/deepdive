Sensitivity to water is a major factor in determining which plant
species succeed in tropical habitats, a finding that suggests
climate change could reshape rainforest diversity, a study says.


Biologists led by Bettina Engelbrecht of the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute in Panama looked at the distribution of 48
species of trees and shrubs, growing in study plots on the
Panamanian isthmus.


The 122 plots ranged from damp Caribbean to dry Pacific slopes.


Where trees and shrubs grew depended crucially on how resistant
they were to drought during the local dry season, they found.


Rainforests are commonly thought of as saturated places, but the
true picture is complex.


Even though temperatures are relatively stable in tropical
regions, water availability and local soil moisture can vary a
lot and over small distances.


These differences are expected to amplify under global warming,
which will change rainfall patterns and the duration of rainy
seasons, making some places wetter and other places drier.


"Our research shows that changes in rainfall patterns will have
considerable consequences for tropical forests," said co-author
Ben Turner in a press release.


In tropical rainforests where global warming lengthens the dry
season and where human development has already fragmented forest
lands, the outcome could be "loss of diversity and perhaps
species extinction," said University of Utah biologist Tom
Kursar.


The study appears on Thursday in the British journal Nature.
