Media watchdog the International Press Institute on Wednesday
said it would give its annual Free Media Pioneer award to
Myanmar's exiled news agency Mizzima News.


Despite a "clampdown on anybody who provides information to
foreign news outlets" by Myanmar's military government, "Mizzima
News has continued to provide accurate and timely news and
information on Burma for both Burmese and English readers and
viewers," IPI said in a statement published in Vienna.


Created in 1998 by a group of journalists exiled from Myanmar
(previously known as Burma), Mizzima News puts out a monthly
newsletter and provides daily print and broadcast news in Burmese
and English by email and on its websites ww.mizima.com and
ww.mizzima.tv.


The New Delhi-based news agency employs some 30 people, including
correspondents in China, India and Thailand, which all house
large communities of Burmese refugees.


The 2006 Free Media Pioneer award went to the Yemen Times daily
newspaper.
