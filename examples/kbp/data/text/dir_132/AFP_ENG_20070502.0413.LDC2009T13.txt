Uzbekistan defended on Wednesday defended the jailing of a rights
activist, saying she had threatened the state by financing non-
governmental organisations with foreign money.


Umida Niyazova, 32, was sentenced on Tuesday to seven years in
jail for illegally crossing the border, smuggling and
distributing publications threatening public order on May 1.


New York-based Human Rights Watch and other rights groups
condemned the verdict as politically motivated.


"Niyazova had financed different unregistered non-governmental
organisations and rights groups operating in Uzbekistan...
receiving money from a number of foreign diplomatic
representative offices," said a foreign ministry statement.


"These facts could be considered as an attempt to interfere in
the internal affairs of a sovereign state."
