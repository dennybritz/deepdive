A Pakistani official rejected Wednesday an Afghan army general's
claim that some Pakistanis were killed along with Taliban in an
anti-militant operation in southern Afghanistan.


Afghan General Moheydin Ghori said Tuesday that up to 56 fighters
were killed on Monday, including "lots of Pakistanis," in a NATO-
led sweep through a Taliban stronghold in the southern province
of Helmand.


But a military spokesman in Islamabad said the NATO-led
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan,
and Afghan officials, after being contacted by Pakistani
officials, had "denied that they made any such claim in the press
about killing of Pakistanis in the operation."


ISAF has said that "a significant number of insurgents" were
killed in the operation in Helmand's Sangin Valley.
