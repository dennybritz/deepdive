Iraqi leaders were sharply criticized for the "alarming and
deteriorating" abuse of religious freedoms in war-torn Iraq, as a
US panel Wednesday called for the country to be put on a watch
list.


"Although non-state actors, particularly the Sunni-dominated
insurgency, are responsible for a substantial proportion of the
sectarian violence and associated human rights violations, the
Iraqi government bears responsibility," the panel said.


Iraqi leaders had used the state security forces to commit human
rights violations through arbitrary arrests, prolonged detentions
and torture, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom
said in its annual report.


And "the Iraqi government tolerates religiously-based attacks and
other religious freedom abuses carried out by armed Shi'a
factions" it added.


The government panel said that if the situation did not improve,
Iraq should next year be put on a blacklist of countries of
particular concern which violate religious freedoms.


On Wednesday the commission recommended that 11 countries should
be put on the blacklist: China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea,
Myanmar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan
and Vietnam.
