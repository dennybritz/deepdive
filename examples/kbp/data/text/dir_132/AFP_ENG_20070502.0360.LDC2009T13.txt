Former world number one Serena Williams announced on Wednesday
she has been forced to withdraw from next week's German Open in
Berlin with a troublesome groin strain.


The 25-year-old, currently ranked 12th in the world, has
struggled with injury recently and also withdrew from the US team
halfway through last month's Fed Cup victory against Belgium with
a knee injury.


Williams, who has won every Grand Slam tournament, stunned the
tennis world by shaking off injury and poor form to win January's
Australian Open, destroying Maria Sharapova in the final despite
her then-ranking of 95th.


Although she may have one eye on the French Open in four weeks'
time, Williams admitted she was disappointed to have to withdraw
from the Berlin event, where eight of the world's top 10 will be
in action.


"Unfortunately, because of a groin injury which has not
completely healed yet, I am forced to withdraw," she said.


"The Berlin tournament is a fantastic event and I hope to be able
to play again there in the future."


Williams has only played in four tournaments this year and had to
withdraw in her first match from a tournament in Charleston last
month.


Former French Open winner Anastasia Myskina of Russia has also
pulled out of the German Open with a toe injury. Myskina played
her last match on the Tour at the beginning of January.
