A UN-backed voluntary repatriation exercise to return Liberian
refugees from Sierra Leone is winding up at the end of June, a
government official said Wednesday.


"June 30 ... is the end of organised voluntary repatriation of
Liberian refugees to their homeland," said Sidi Bah, director of
a government-funded resettlement commission, which works jointly
with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).


"We shall not have an organised convoy taking refugees back to
Liberia after this deadline," he added.


Only 6,000 refugees are expected to stay behind out of some
54,600 who fled into the country during Liberia's civil war that
ended in 2003.


The remaining refugees' status will be considered "on a case-by-
case basis but there will be the possibility of local integration
for them", he said.


Fourteen years of vicious civil war left no corner of the tiny
west African country unscathed and claimed hundreds of thousands
of lives.


At the height of the Liberian crisis, some 850,000 people were
displaced by violence, the majority of whom sought asylum in
neighbouring countries.


Last year some 169,000 registered Liberian refugees remained in
various countries across west Africa.
