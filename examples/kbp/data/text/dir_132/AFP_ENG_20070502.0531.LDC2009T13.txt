A Palestinian fund will be created to receive financial aid from
foreign donors while allowing them to maintain their boycott of
the Hamas-led coalition government, the information minister said
on Wednesday.


"The Palestinian government has approved the creation of a fund
to receive international aid in the name of the PLO (Palestine
Liberation Organisation)," Mustapha al-Barghuti said.


The moneys would be controlled directly by the PLO's economic
department, to which PLO chief and Palestinian president Mahmud
Abbas recently named finance minister Salam Fayyad, widely
respected in the West, as head.


When Hamas formed a government following an election victory in
January 2006, the Palestinian Authority was boycotted by the
United States, the European Union and others because they
consider the Islamist group to be a terrorist organisation.


Hamas, which does not belong to the PLO, agreed with Abbas and
his Fatah party in March to form a coalition government. However,
the boycott is still being applied, and the Palestinian
territories continue to suffer severe economic hardships.


Barghuti said creation of the fund would allow banks to transfer
funds without fear of falling foul of sanctions.
