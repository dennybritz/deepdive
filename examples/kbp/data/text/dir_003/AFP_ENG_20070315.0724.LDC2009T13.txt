Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has formally asked to
attend a UN Security Council meeting when new sanctions against
his country are to be voted on, the council president said
Thursday.


"He (Ahmadinejad) wants to come when the resolution is being
adopted," South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo, who chairs
the council this month, told reporters after being informed by
his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif.
