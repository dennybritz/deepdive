Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Friday he expected his visit to
Japan next month would further warm relations between the two
nations.


Addressing reporters at the end of parliament's annual session,
Wen highlighted how Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to
Beijing in October last year had kick-started the improvement of
bilateral ties.


"If Prime Minister Abe's visit to China... can be described as an
ice breaker, then I hope my visit to Japan will be an ice
thawer," Wen said.


Wen said that, during his visit, he expected agreements would be
signed on bilateral economic cooperation, as well as in the
fields of science and education.
