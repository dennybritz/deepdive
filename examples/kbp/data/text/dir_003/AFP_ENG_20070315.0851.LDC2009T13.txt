Milwaukee Bucks rookie Lynn Greer helped make Larry Krystkowiak's
first game as a National Basketball Association head coach a
success.


Greer scored a career-high 14 points and Michael Redd added 29 as
the Bucks used hot shooting en route to a 101-90 victory over San
Antonio, snapping the Spurs' season-high 13-game winning streak.


Milwaukee's Australian center Andrew Bogut collected 13 points
and 12 rebounds as the Bucks shot 53 percent from the field.


A day after replacing the fired Terry Stotts as coach of reeling
Milwaukee, Krystkowiak guided his squad to an upset victory over
one of the NBA's hottest teams.


Stotts was fired on Wednesday after one-plus seasons with the
team.


Krystkowiak was originally hired on June 22 as an assistant
coach. He takes over a team mired in last place in the Central
Division and tied for 13th out of 15 teams in the weak Eastern
Conference.


But the inexperienced coach got help from the little-used Greer,
who shot 4-of-6 from the floor, including 3-of-3 from 3-point
range, in 15 minutes.


An undrafted rookie, Greer had played only six minutes the entire
season entering Thursday's game.


Redd shot 13-of-20 from the field and Bogut was 6-of-9.


Brent Barry scored 20 points and Tim Duncan added 13 and 13
rebounds for the Spurs, who had outscored opponents by an average
of over 15 points during their streak.
