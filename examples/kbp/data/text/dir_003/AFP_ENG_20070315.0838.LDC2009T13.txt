Hong Kong share prices opened 0.65 percent lower Friday on fresh
worries that China may announce further measures to tighten
credit and slow economic growth, dealers said.


They said the fears were renewed by economic data announced
Thursday, which showed China's industrial output expanding by
18.5 percent in the first two months of 2007, a figure that was
stronger than expected.


That data came on top of other recent economic indicators from
the mainland, including a record trade surplus of 23.8 billion US
dollars in February and loan growth accelerating to 17.2 percent.


Dealers said a weaker Japanese market and continuing concerns
over the US mortgage sector also dampened investor sentiment.


The Hang Seng Index opened down 122.95 points at 18,846.49.
