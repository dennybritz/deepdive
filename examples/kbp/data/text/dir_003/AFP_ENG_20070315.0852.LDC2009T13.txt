Central Tokyo saw its first snow of the season Friday, after the
first snowless winter in the Japanese capital on record,
meteorologists said.


Sleety rain turned into very light snow early Friday, but only
lasted 15 minutes.


"The snow system is moving away from Japan and the snow has
ended," said an official at the Japan Meteorological Agency.


The central area of Tokyo saw no snow during the winter, which
the Meteorological Agency defines as finishing at the end of
February, although some outlying parts of the metropolis had
flurries.


It was the first snowless winter since records began in 1876.


Tokyo usually sees its first snowfall of the season by early
January.


Japan's unseasonably mild winter came amid growing concern about
global warming. The Meteorological Agency has said a main reason
for the warm winter was the El Nino effect in the Pacific.
