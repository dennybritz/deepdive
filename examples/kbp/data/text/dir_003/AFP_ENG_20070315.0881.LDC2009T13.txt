Andy Roddick defeated Ivan Ljubicic 7-6 (9/7), 7-6 (10/8) in the
quarter-finals of the ATP/WTA Pacific Life Open on Thursday.


Third seeded Roddick moves to the semi-finals where he will play
Rafael Nadal of Spain on Saturday.


Roddick has not lost a set in the 5.3 million dollar hardcourt
tournament as he fired eight aces and 32 winners on Thursday in
front of a crowd of about 11,000 at the main Indian Wells Tennis
Garden stadium.


"It was a little more exciting in those tie breaks than I
wanted," Roddick said. "I kept thinking I had him and then he
came up with those great shots."


Nadal and Roddick have not played since the 2004 Davis Cup final,
where Nadal avenged a loss to Roddick in the US Open two months
earlier with a four-set victory.


The 24-year-old American and former world number one Roddick is
seeking his 22nd career singles title and first in Indian Wells.


Ljubicic fought off three match points in the second set tiebreak
before Roddick clinched the match on the fourth match point when
the Croatian's final shot sailed wide.


"I didn't convert the chances I had but luckily I was able to
squeak through on the breakers," Roddick said.


Nadal and Roddick have stepped up their bids for their first
Pacific Life Open title with the early elimination of Swiss
superstar Roger Federer who lost in the second round.
