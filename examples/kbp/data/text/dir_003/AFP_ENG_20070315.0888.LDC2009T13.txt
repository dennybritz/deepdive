Canadian company Bombardier apologised Friday after one of its
passenger jets operated by a Japanese carrier failed to lower its
front wheels, forcing the plane to make a dramatic belly-landing.


Company vice president Todd Young held talks at Japan's transport
ministry to discuss this week's incident, which was caught on
television and led to a nationwide investigation of Bombardier
planes.


"Let me send our sincere regrets and apologies to all concerned,"
Young later told reporters, offering a Japanese-style bow.


On Tuesday, a Bombardier DHC-8 run by All Nippon Airways had to
circle the skies above a regional airport to try various ways to
get its front wheel down. It finally landed with only its rear
wheels deplyoed, with the nose skidding on the runway.


None of the 60 people on board were injured.


The transport ministry immediately ordered checks on the landing
gear of all 36 Bombardier DHC-8 planes in operation in Japan
before they can fly again.


All Nippon Airways indefinitely suspended flights using its 13
DHC-8 planes.


Young was also due to visit Kochi airport in southwestern Japan
where the incident took place.
