China's urban fixed asset investment rose 23.4 percent in the
first two months of 2007 from the same period a year earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics said Friday.


The slightly lower figure compared with a 24 percent rise for all
of 2006 will be a relief to regulators after a slew of data
pointing to an economy that continues to pick up speed after
breakneck growth of 10.7 percent last year.


"The figure is not very high compared with last year so I don't
think it will make the government issue more tightening policies
on investment," said Ma Qing, an analyst with Citic Securities
based in Beijing.


In January and February of 2006, investment in fixed asset
increased 26.6 percent from a year earlier.


Total new fixed investment, a key indicator of state-funded
spending on major infrastructure, for January and February was
653.5 billion yuan (84 billion dollars), the statistics bureau
said in a statement.


Much of that investment was poured into China's state-owned
enterprises and projects, which for the two months to February
totalled 294.6 billion yuan.


Real estate, a sector that regulators have long worried is
overheated, received fresh funds of 178.6 billion yuan, it added.


Fixed asset investment is being driven by huge amounts of
liquidity in China's financial system.


China publishes combined figures for the first two months of the
year to minimise the distortion of the week-long New Year
holiday, which falls in either January or February.
