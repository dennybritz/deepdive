The National Basketball Association champion Miami Heat are on a
hot streak.


Udonis Haslem collected 21 points and 12 rebounds and superstar
center Shaquille O'Neal scored 17 of his 19 points in the second
half on Thursday as the Heat extended their season-high winning
streak to eight games with a 93-86 victory over the New Jersey
Nets.


After winning all six games on their homestand, the Heat are one-
half game behind first-place Washington in the Southeast
Division. The Heat are also just 2 1/2 games behind Chicago for
fifth place in the Eastern Conference.


The Heat rapidly are climbing toward one of the top four seeds in
the East and home-court advantage in the first round of the
playoffs.


Much of their success can be attributed to their interior play.


On Thursday, they scored 44 points in the paint led by Haslem and
O'Neal, who combined to shoot 15-of-23 from the field.


Reserve center Alonzo Mourning also played well, scoring 11
points on 5-of-7 shooting in just 17 minutes.


Improving to 9-2 without superstar Dwyane Wade, who will be out
at least another month rehabilitating a dislocated shoulder,
Miami has relied on O'Neal. O'Neal put the Heat on his back once
again Thursday, using his trademark power to dominate after
halftime.
