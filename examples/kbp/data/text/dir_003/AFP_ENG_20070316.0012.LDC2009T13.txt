The FBI raided the North American headquarters of All Nippon
Airways, halting the Japanese carrier's ticket reservations for
the region for several hours, a spokeswoman said Friday.


US law enforcement agents searched the office in Los Angeles on
Thursday but ANA "doesn't know the reason as the FBI's warrant
for the raid did not state what kind of suspicions they have,"
she said.


"Our flight ticket reservations were suspended temporarily but
have now returned to normal," she added.


The US government said in February of last year that it was
investigating possible price fixing by the air cargo industry in
a joint probe with European Union authorities.


But ANA said it was unclear whether the search of its Los Angeles
office was connected with the air cargo probe.


"We are trying to establish the purpose of the raid but it is not
connected with flight operations or terrorism," ANA said in a
statement.
