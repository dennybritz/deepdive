Doing well at the world swimming championships is crucial ahead
of next year's Beijing Olympics, Australian head coach Alan
Thompson has told his team.


While Australia's women have gone from strength to strength in
recent years, their men have struggled, drawing widespread flak
after winning just one gold at the Commonwealth Games, their
biggest international meet last year.


Competing without Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett, the normally
dominant men won only the final relay. In stark contrast, the
Australian women claimed 16 gold medals.


Thompson said he expected an improved performance at the worlds
here from the men with the Olympics in 2008 the ultimate goal.


"It's an important meet for them to make a mark on the rest of
the world and show where they are at this stage," he was quoted
as saying in the Herald Sun.


"There are a lot of good conversions from performing well here to
having good results at the Olympics.


"They can really set themselves up."


The Australians will go head-to-head with the United States when
the main swimming events start here on March 25, with Thompson
forecasting one of the fastest world championships ever seen.


"The depth of the finals is going to be faster than we have ever
seen before," Thompson said.


"There is probably two ways to judge how fast a meet is -- one
will be by the number of world records (that) are broken and the
other will be by the depth of finals.


"There is a multitude of events where to try and pick a winner
would be very difficult."


The world swimming championships officially open on Saturday,
with the first medals being decided on Sunday in open water
swimming and synchronized swimming.
