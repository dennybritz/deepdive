Top French insurer AXA on Friday signed a contract to acquire
South Korea's largest on-line auto insurance company, company
officials said.


Under a memorandum of understanding signed here, Kyobo Life
Insurance Co will sell all its 74.7 percent controlling stake in
its online auto insurance unit Kyobo Auto Insurance to AXA, Kyobo
Life said in a press statement.


Given a greenlight for the deal from financial watchdogs here,
AXA will become the first foreign insurance company to gain
access to South Korea's auto insurance market. South Korea has
some 13 million registered vehicles.


Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed but Yonhap
News Agency said the deal was worth 90.5 billion won (95.7
million dollars), including 40 billion won in a management
premium.


The per-share nominal value of the auto insurance unit is 5,000
won.


"Kyobo Life decided to spin off Kyobo Auto Insurance as synergies
between life insurance and auto insurance operations will be
weaker-than-expected in the long-term," Kyobo Life said.


Launched in October 2001, the auto insurance company has 1,200
employees and total assets worth 220.6 billon won. It had a 35
percent share in the local on- line auto insurance market as of
the end of December.


Kyobo Life said AXA has given a full job guarantee to Kyobo
Auto's employees.
