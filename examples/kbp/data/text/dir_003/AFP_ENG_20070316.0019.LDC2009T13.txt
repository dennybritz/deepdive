Indonesia will use the names of characters from Javanese
mythology to name cyclones when it begins a new weather warning
service, a report said Friday.


Indonesian meteorology official Sri Woro Harijono said "we will
issue all tropical cyclone warnings in southern Indonesia,
including naming them" when the service starts later this year,
the Media Indonesia newspaper reported.


Ten names running in alphabetical order such as "Arimbi," a
giantess, "Bima," a master of wisdom, and "Cakil," a demon, are
to be prepared, she said.


Indonesia has informed the World Meteorological Organization that
it is ready to begin operating the cyclone warning centre from
November, the paper said.


Javanese mythology evolved from ancient Indian epics. Ethnic
Javanese make up around 40 percent of Indonesia's 220 million
people.
