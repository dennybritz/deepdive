China's parliament on Friday passed a long-anticipated law that
will unify tax rates for local and foreign companies, adding
billions of dollars to the total tax bill paid by non-Chinese
firms.


A total of 2,826 lawmakers voted for the law, or 97.8 percent of
those present in Beijing's Great Hall of the People as the annual
full session of parliament was approaching its conclusion.


The Enterprise Income Tax Law will force most foreign-invested
companies to eventually return 25 percent of their income to the
government in tax, compared with the current preferential tax
rate of 15 percent.
