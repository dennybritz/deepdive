France's defence minister called Friday for diplomacy to resolve
the Iranian nuclear crisis, warning that military action risked
inflaming the Islamic world.


The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany
on Thursday agreed on a new package of sanctions on Iran for its
refusal to suspend sensitive nuclear work.


"This crisis should be resolved through diplomatic pressure,"
French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie told a news
conference in Tokyo.


"One cannot completely rule out military intervention, but that
represents a real risk," she said.


She referred to "the risk of a kind of solidarity developing
among people in the Muslim world towards Iran and creating a gulf
between the Muslim world and the rest of the world that together
we have been able to prevent after the September 11 attacks."


"We first have to do our utmost diplomatically to drive Iran to
abide by its signature on non-proliferation treaties and
international norms," she said.


She welcomed the deal on a sanctions package, which paves the way
for the Council to pass a new sanctions resolution next week.


"It's because all the countries are in agreement that the
resolution can have an effect," Alliot-Marie said.


Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has vowed never to
surrender to the Council's demand to suspend uranium enrichment,
a process that can be used both to make nuclear fuel and the
explosive core of an atomic bomb.


The new resolution would bar Iran from exporting arms and
restrict the sale or transfer to Tehran of equipment including
battle tanks, combat aircraft, attack helicopters and missiles.
