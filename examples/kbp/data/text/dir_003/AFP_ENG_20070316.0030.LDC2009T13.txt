Australian shares closed down 0.29 percent Friday as market
sentiment remained cautious following heavy sell-offs on global
markets earlier in the week on concerns at problems in the US
housing market, dealers said.


The key S&P/ASX 200 dropped 16.7 points at 5,836.3 while the
broader All Ordinaries index fell 14.0 points to 5,817.8.
