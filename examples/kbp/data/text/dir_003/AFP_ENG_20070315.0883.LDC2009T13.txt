The Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen were quickest in
opening practice here Friday for Sunday's season-opening
Australian Formula One Grand Prix.


Massa and Raikkonen lived up to their winter pre-season testing
performances by dominating the second practice session to give
Ferrari the early edge ahead of the weekend.


Massa clocked the fastest lap of one minute 27.353 seconds around
the 5.3-kilometre Albert Park street circuit.


The Brazilian shaded his teammate Raikkonen by 0.397secs in the
second session, with reigning world champion Fernando Alonso,
driving for his new McLaren team, seventh best with 1:28.040,
some 0.687secs behind.


Raikkonen, who was recruited last season by Ferrari to replace
retired seven- times world champion Michael Schumacher, was timed
at 1:27.750.


Briton Lewis Hamilton, Alonso's rookie teammate at McLaren, was
third-fastest with 1:27.829 ahead of Renault's Giancarlo
Fisichella on 1:27.941.


BMW-Sauber's German driver Nick Heidfeld clocked in fifth
quickest with 1:27.970.


Alonso, who was fastest in opening morning practice, got in 25
laps in the afternoon session and improved on his morning best of
1:29.214.
