Japanese share prices closed down 0.69 percent Friday as
investors remained wary about a stronger yen and problems brewing
in the US housing sector, dealers said.


They said the market was cautious despite modest overnight gains
on Wall Street, with sentiment still fragile after the recent
sharp falls on global bourses.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index of leading
shares fell 116.24 points to 16,744.15.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section dropped 17.12 points or 1.01 percent to 1,677.06.
