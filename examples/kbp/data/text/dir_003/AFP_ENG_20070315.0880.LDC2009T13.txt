An influential Buddhist master started a mass requiem for those
killed on both sides of the Vietnam War Friday, on his second
return visit since he was exiled four decades ago.


Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, 81 -- who opposed the war and was
barred from his homeland by both the former US-backed South
Vietnamese regime and the post-1975 communist government -- said
he hoped to aid reconciliation.


Some 5,000 people attended the start of the three-day chanting
ceremony, held under close police supervision in Vinh Nghiem
pagoda in Ho Chi Minh City. It is the first of three such events
planned during Hanh's three-month trip.


The aim of the ceremonies is "to send compassionate and healing
energy to all those who died unjustly during the war, no matter
what their political views, religions or ideologies were," he
said earlier.


Speaking on the eve of the prayer meeting, Hanh, a religious
leader, peace activist and best-selling author, said: "We have to
recognize this pain in order to transform it and not to pass it
on to the next generation."
