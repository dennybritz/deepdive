Corruption is worsening in China and needs to be addressed by
reforming the country's communist political system to reduce
"over-concentration" of power, Premier Wen Jiabao said Friday.


"Corruption has become more serious, sometimes involving high-
ranking officials in this country," Wen told a press conference
at the conclusion of the annual session of the National People's
Congress, China's parliament.


Wen blamed an "overconcentration of power without effective and
proper restraint and oversight", vowing that corrupt officials
and businesspeople would be brought to justice.
