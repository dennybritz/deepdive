A new company charged with investing part of China's huge forex
reserves "will not have any adverse impact" on US-dollar
denominated assets, Premier Wen Jiabao said Friday.


"I can assure you that instituting such a foreign exchange
reserve investment company will not have any adverse impact on
US-dollar denominated assets," Wen told reporters after
parliament's annual meeting.


The company, which China is now in the process of setting up, is
expected to be charged with investing about 200 billion dollars
of China's more than one trillion dollars of foreign exchange
reserves.
