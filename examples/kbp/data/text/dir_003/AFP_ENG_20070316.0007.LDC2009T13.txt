Hong Kong share prices ended the Friday morning session 0.85
percent higher as gains in China Mobile and CITIC Pacific helped
the market reverse early losses driven by worries over possible
policy-tightening measures in China, dealers said.


CITIC Pacific gained after announcing 107 percent rise in 2006
net profit while China Mobile was up ahead of its full-year
results next week.


Dealers said some short-covering activity in HSBC also helped the
market turn around.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 160.66 points at
19,130.10, off a low of 18,770.28. Turnover was 24 billion
dollars (3.1 billion US).


China Mobile was up 2.0 dollars or 2.91 percent at 70.65 dollars,
CITIC Pacific was up 0.50 or 1.88 percent at 27.15 and HSBC
gained 0.50 or 0.37 percent to 134.80.
