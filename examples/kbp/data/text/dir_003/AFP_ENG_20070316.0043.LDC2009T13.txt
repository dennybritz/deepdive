Afghanistan's Taliban movement, which threatened to kill an
Italian journalist unless its demands were met, said Friday the
ultimatum was over but could be extended on request.


Daniele Mastrogiacomo, 52, was kidnapped with two Afghan
colleagues in southern Afghanistan on March 4.


A top Taliban commander told AFP last Saturday that the Italian
would be killed in seven days unless two captured Taliban
spokesmen were released and Italy set a date for the withdrawal
of its 2,000 troops in Afghanistan.


"The ultimatum is over," Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP
by telephone Friday.


He said the group had however told "the Italians we are in
contact with" that it could be extended. "We told them if you
request for time via media, we will give you more time," he said.


"There has been some progress in negotiations and if our demands
are accepted, we will release the journalist."


Ahmadi did not make clear who the group was in talks with.


Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said Thursday his
government was not negotiating with the Taliban but that there
were "humanitarian sources which maintain the contacts."


Mastrogiacomo's employer, La Repubblica newspaper, on Thursday
made an appeal for the "necessary time" to allows the
negotiations to continue.


In a recorded message obtained by Afghanistan's Pajhwok News
Agency, the correspondent said if nothing was done by Friday "it
will create problems for me."
