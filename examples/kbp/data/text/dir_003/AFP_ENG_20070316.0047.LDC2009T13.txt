British driver Jenson Button has backed his Honda team's efforts
to take a lead on environmental issues in Formula One with their
new 'Earth' cars in this year's world championship.


The Honda Racing F1 team have revealed a revolutionary new livery
for their RA107 Formula One car, with which they aim to raise
awareness of the environmental issues of climate change and
greenhouse gasses facing the planet.


The car features a huge image of the Earth instead of the
customary advertising and sponsor logos.


Button, who along with teammate Rubens Barrichello visited a
local primary school here this week to update the school's
lighting system with eco-friendly fluorescent globes, voiced his
support for the team's commitment.


"I don't think a lot of people are aware of the big issues and I
think it's a great idea," Button told a press conference after a
free practice ahead of Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand
Prix.


"We get through to hundreds of millions of people and I wasn't
aware of the issues six months ago and now I am, and it's changed
my life in a little way.


"It might not be in a big way, but it makes a difference if we're
all capable of making those changes."


Honda have also developed a revolutionary vehicle which emits
only water and which will be available in lease sales in Japan
and the United States next year.
