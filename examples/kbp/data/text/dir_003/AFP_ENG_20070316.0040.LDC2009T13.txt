Chinese web portal Sina.com announced it will tie up with five
foreign record companies to build a digital music platform that
could become the largest of its kind in China, state media said
Friday.


Sina.com said the digital music platform will provide services
including online music, downloads and other wireless value-added
services, the Shanghai Securities News said.


The company said its five partners are Sony BMG, Universal,
Warner, EMI and Rock Records, who reportedly hold a total of 80
percent of the world's music recording market.


The tie-up involves an unspecified profit-sharing scheme from
advertising, download fees and revenue from wireless value-added
services.


Sina.com is exploring the "Internet plus mobile phones" format of
music access on the strength of the rapid development of
broadband and mobile phone networks, according to the report.


Government figures showed that by the end of 2006 the number of
mobile phone users in China has exceeded 460 million, with
Internet subscribers at more than 130 million.


The research firm iSuppli forecast earlier last year that digital
music will become a much more lucrative business for both the
record and the Internet industries in the next few years.


The global digital music market by 2010 is likely to hit nearly
14.9 billion dollars, a six-fold increase from in 2005, and see
its share in the whole music industry rise from 12 percent in
2006 to 40 percent, iSuppli said.
