Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Friday that the mainland
government had not interfered in Hong Kong's internal affairs in
the 10 years since the former British colony returned to Chinese
sovereignty.


"Since Hong Kong returned to the motherland, we have not
intervened in Hong Kong matters," Wen said at the close of the
annual full session of parliament. "Hong Kong has the strong
backing of the mainland."


Since it returned to China in 1997, Beijing has handpicked the
territory's top leader and has controlled Hong Kong legislative
elections through a system greatly favouring those loyal to
Beijing, most notably the business community.


Wen also tried to quell concern that booming Chinese cities like
Shanghai and Shenzhen could replace Hong Kong as a regional and
international finance and shipping centre.


"Hong Kong has a unique geographic situation ... and the freest
economy in the world," Wen said. "Hong Kong's role as an
international financial centre, shipping centre and trading
centre cannot be replaced."


The 10th anniversary of the handover to China is on July 1.
