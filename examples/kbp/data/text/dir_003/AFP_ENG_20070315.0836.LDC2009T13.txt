Beijing authorities are replacing hundreds of kilometres of old
and rusting water pipes to ensure ensure tap water at the 2008
Olympics sites is safe to drink, state media reported on Friday.


"Tap water in the Olympic gyms and the athletes' village will be
safe to drink," Jiao Zhizhong, head of the Beijing Water
Authority, was quoted as saying by the China Daily newspaper.


"Beijing's old water pipes are being replaced at a rate of 300
kilometres (190 miles) a year," he said.


The paper said the Olympics would place "enormous pressure on the
already parched city," which is in the grip of a long drought.


The Beijing Water Works Group, responsible for ensuring the
city's water supply, has earmarked 256 million dollars to upgrade
the city's water system to guarantee sufficient supplies during
the games next August, and a further 22 million to repair leaky
water pipes, it said.


"New water-pipe systems have already been installed in the
Olympic zone and surrounding areas to ensure the provision of
safe drinking water," the paper said.


State media said recently that there was only enough water in
Beijing to adequately supply a little over 14 million people in
2005, but at the end of last year the city had some 15 million
permanent residents and four million migrant workers.


A project to divert water from the Yangtze River basin will
provide Beijing with an additional 400 million cubic metres of
water a year, the paper quoted sources with the Beijing Water
Works Group as saying.


The city currently uses more than one billion cubic metres of
water a year, it said.
