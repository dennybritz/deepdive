Suspected Muslim separatists briefly detained 20 fishermen who
strayed into a rebel-claimed area in the southern Philippines,
releasing all but one a day later, police said Friday.


The fishermen were snatched Wednesday near the town of Midsayap
in a marshland controlled by rebels from the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), local police chief Superintedent Chino
Mamburam said.


Nineteen were freed on Thursday, and they told police the MILF
rebels -- who are fighting for an independent Islamic state on
southern Mindanao island -- had demanded a firearm as ransom for
the last captive, he said.


"They want a M-16 Armalite rifle in exchange for the victim's
liberty," Mamburam said.


Security forces have given the MILF 72 hours to release the
hostage or risk facing a police assault, he added.


The 12,000-strong MILF, which has been fighting for nearly four
decades, signed a truce with Manila in 2003, paving the way for
peace talks.


But the negotiations stalled last year over when the MILF
demanded economic control of ancestral lands.


Heavy clashes near Midsayap last week left 17 rebels and a
soldier dead.


President Gloria Arroyo then ordered a halt in military
offensives in a bid to salvage the peace talks.


It was not immediately clear how the hostage-taking would affect
the peace process. The MILF could not be reached for comment.
