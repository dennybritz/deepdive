China's parliament Friday overwhelmingly approved a property law
that had sparked controversy by offering unprecedented protection
to both the government and private sector.


A total of 2,799 lawmakers voted for the law, or 96.9 percent of
those present in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on the final
day of the annual full session of parliament.


The law, by offering protection for private as well as public
ownership, reflects how far the nominally socialist state has
moved over nearly three decades of reform.
