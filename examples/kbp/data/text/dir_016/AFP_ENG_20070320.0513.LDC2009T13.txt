Belgium's nearly 10 million mobile phone users could soon use
text messages to pay for everything from a taxi ride to a pizza
in what organisers of the new system describe as a "world first."


"No other country has developed an equivalent system," said
Vincent Roland, the chief executive of Belgian firm Banksys,
which is developing and will run the service.


"In some countries, it's possible to pay for a soda or parking
with a text message, but those are less secure solutions for the
user and have fewer payment guarantees for the seller," he said.


When the service is launched in mid May, users will need a bank
account in Belgium and a mobile phone subscription for one of the
three Belgian networks: Proximus, Mobistar and Base.


A trader or service provider sends a request for payment in a
text message to the customer, who then confirms the purchase with
a secret code. Both then receive a text message confirming the
transaction.


There are no subscription fees for the service but buyers will be
charged 25 euro cents, including value added tax, per purchase
while sellers will have to pay 49 cents excluding VAT.


The profits will be shared out between Banksys, mobile operators
and the banks.


The service will only be applicable for purchases over six euros.


Banksys' Roland said that the service could be particularly
attractive for plumbers, taxi drivers and delivery people who
cannot take payments with traditional debit or credit cards.


If it takes off in Belgium, Banksys and its French parent company
Atos plan to develop the service in Britain, France and Italy.


Development of the system has taken three years and cost "several
hundred thousand euros per operator," according to an official at
Mobistar.
