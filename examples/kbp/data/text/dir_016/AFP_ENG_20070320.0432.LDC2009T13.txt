England captain Michael Vaughan suffered a fresh injury problem
after a freak accident during practice here Tuesday.


Vaughan tripped on a pot-hole during fielding practice and had to
have ice- treatment on his right knee.


The Yorkshire batsman spent most of last year sidelined with
problems to his right knee, which required a fourth operation,
and missed the climax of England's victorious one-day series
triumph in Australia with hamstring trouble.


However, England spokesman Andrew Walpole said: "He's absloutely
fine. He fell in a small hole that was in the outfield and banged
his knee."


Vaughan was not taken to hospital, England deciding the injury
did not require an X-ray.


Meanwhile paceman James Anderson, who played in the 51-run win
over Canada on Sunday with a broken right little finger, didn't
bowl in the nets but England said he was being rested.


England, who lost their Group C opener to New Zealand, play Kenya
on Saturday.
