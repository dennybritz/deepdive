Seychelles President James Michel on Tuesday dissolved the Indian
Ocean island nation's parliament to pave the way for early
legislative elections.


Polls for the 34-member parliament will take place within the
next three months instead of mid-October. The nation's election
board is due to announce the voting date soon.


"I call upon the people of Seychelles to elect a new assembly
which is responsible and consistent in its decisions and
actions," said Michel in his annual address to parliament.


Eleven opposition lawmakers have been absent from parliament
since police dispersed an illegal meeting in October where
opposition supporters were protesting legislation banning
political parties and religious groups from owning radio
stations.


"Democracy does not mean that the opposition should use different
ways and means such as encouraging illegal gatherings to incite
violence and create disorder so that they can attain what they
did not in the democratic electoral process," he said.


Michel won a five-year term in August presidential elections in
the archipelago of some 84,000 inhabitants.


The Seychelles is known for its white sandy beaches, translucent
green waters and luxury resorts, but is saddled with one of the
world's highest per capita debt burdens and a chronic foreign
exchange shortage.
