The African Union asked the UN Security Council on Tuesday to
support a peace deal between the Ivory Coast government and
rebels by gradually withdrawing UN troops from the country.


Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo and rebel chief Guillaume
Soro signed an accord in Burkina Faso on March 4 that called for
the creation of a transitional government by mid-April and the
scaling down of UN and French troops.


The AU Peace and Security Council "recommends to the United
Nations Security Council the gradual drawdown of the impartial
forces deployed in Cote d'Ivoire in line with the provisions for
the implementation of the Ouagadougou Accord and for the
restoration of peace and normalcy in the country," it said in a
statement.


The AU has endorsed the agreement that also called for the
gradual dismantling of a ceasefire zone in a country which is
currently patrolled by more than 10,000 UN and French troops.


The accord demanded progress on an electoral census ahead of
future polling, the disarming of rebels and their integration
into a future national army, which were seen as stumbling blocks
on previous agreements.


Soro led a 2002 abortive coup against Gbagbo which triggered a
brief civil war and divided the country into two zones, with the
rebels controlling the north.


The current transitional government in Ivory Coast is headed by
UN-backed Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny, who was sidelined
from the peace deal.
