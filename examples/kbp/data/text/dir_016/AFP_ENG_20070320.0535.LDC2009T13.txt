The 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
on Tuesday reminded Nigerians of the international community's
expectations that they will hold successful democratic elections
next month.


"ECOWAS calls on the Nigerian authorities, leaders of political
parties and heads of constitutional institutions to demonstrate
the highest sense of responsibility in ensuring the success of
the April 2007 general elections," the group said in the
statement.


"All Nigerian stakeholders should be mindful of the high
expectations of West Africa, Africa and indeed the entire world
in the ongoing electoral process in Nigeria and desist from any
actions or pronouncements likely to inflame tensions, cause
violence or undermine the credibility of the elections," it said.


The landmark poll, which should lead to Nigeria's first civilian-
to-civilian transition, is important not only for deepening
democracy in Nigeria but also for consolidating the gains made in
the sub-region in the areas of peace, stability and good
governance, it added.


The bloc had earlier this year sent to Nigeria a pre-election
mission, led by former Gambian president Dawda Jawara, to
appraise the preparations for the poll.


ECOWAS also plans to send an observer mission for the April
elections.


Nigeria is a founding member of ECOWAS, established in 1975 to
promote economic integration, peace and stability of the region.


ECOWAS has its headquarters in the Nigerian capital Abuja.
