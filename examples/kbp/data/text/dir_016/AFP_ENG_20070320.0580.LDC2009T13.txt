Football's world governing body FIFA banned Valencia defender
David Navarro from all football for seven months backing up
UEFA's decision to suspend him for breaking the nose of Inter
Milan's Nicolas Burdisso in their Champions League match a
fortnight ago.


UEFA had asked FIFA to extend the ban to all world football and
the Spanish club confirmed on Tuesday they had received a
statement from FIFA.


"Valencia received FIFA's official statement on Tuesday which
confirmed the ban had been extended," announced the club.


Earlier on Tuesday both Valencia and Inter Milan filed appeals
with UEFA over the penalties incurred after a mass brawl in their
Champions League tie two weeks ago.


The appeals hearing will take place at the UEFA headquarters in
Nyon, Switzerland on March 28, and all of the players have been
summoned to attend, UEFA said in a statement.


UEFA fined both clubs 155,772 euros (207,223 dollars).


Burdisso picked up a six match ban for his part in the flare up
at the end of the acrimonious last 16 second leg tie on March 6
which ended goalless but saw Valencia go through to the quarter-
finals on the away goals rule.


Burdisso's teammate Maicon was also hit with a six match ban
while UEFA's disciplinary committee dished out three and two
match suspensions respectively to two further Inter players, Ivan
Cordoba and Julio Cruz.


Valencia player Carlos Marchena was also hit with a four-match
ban for his role in the incident.
