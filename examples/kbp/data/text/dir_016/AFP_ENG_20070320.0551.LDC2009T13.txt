US shares ended higher Tuesday as Federal Reserve policymakers
met in Washington to mull interest rates with most economists
expecting the Fed to announce no change in rates Wednesday.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 61.05 points (0.50
percent) at 12,287.22 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite finished 13.80 points (0.58 percent) higher
at 2,408.21 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 rose a
strong 8.71 points (0.62 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,410.77.


Shares gained with most analysts expecting the Fed to announce
Wednesday that it would keep its short term interest rate
anchored at 5.25 percent and await further economic developments
before changing rates.


The US markets had initially opened lower, but gained some
momentum as investors digested a government report that showed a
surprise rebound in housing starts.
