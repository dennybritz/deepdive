Around 100 Spanish lawmakers marked the fourth anniversary of the
war in Iraq with five minutes of silence in parliament on Tuesday
before demanding an end to war.


The pro-Communist United Left opposition grouping called for the
symbolic move, four years after the former conservative
government of Jose Maria Aznar backed the US-led invasion by
committing Spanish troops to the undertaking.


Tuesday's gesture involved lawmakers from all parliamentary
groups, save for the Popular Party (PP), which Aznar led before
stepping down as prime minister following a 2004 general election
won by the Socialists.


One of the group broke the silence by shouting "No to war!" and
others followed his example.


Socialist Party spokesman Diego Lopez Garrido said the invasion
had proved "catastrophic" and increased "terrorism and
instability."


Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero swiftly withdrew the
troops Aznar had sent within weeks of taking office to fulfil a
manifesto pledge.


The Socialists won office just three days after the Madrid train
bombings which killed 191 people and which were claimed by
radical Islamists sympathetic to Al- Qaeda and who wanted to
punish Spain for backing the invasion.
