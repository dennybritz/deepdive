French cyclist Jean-Patrick Nazon collided with a car in training
and will not be competing in Saturday's Milan-San Remo one-day
classic, his AG2R team said.


Nazon, who won the first stage of last week's Paris-Nice race,
skidded on a puddle of oil during a training ride with Nicolas
Roche around Antibes in the south of France.


He then collided with a car, but, after being taken to hospital,
he was deemed to have bumps and bruises but nothing broken. The
30-year-old rider was ordered to have a week's rest however.
