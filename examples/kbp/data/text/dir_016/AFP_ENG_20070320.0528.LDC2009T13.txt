Auxerre's Benoit Pedretti, who tore a muscle in his right leg
during the 1-0 French league win over Lens at the weekend, will
be out for three weeks.


The 26-year-old midfielder, who had to leave the pitch in
Sunday's match in the 70th minute, had tests early Tuesday which
revealed the extent of the problem.
