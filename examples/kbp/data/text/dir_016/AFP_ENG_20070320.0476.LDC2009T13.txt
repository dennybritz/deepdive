Morocco and Greece on Tuesday signed three agreements to promote
cooperation on renewable energy, an official here said.


The accords are designed to give Moroccan companies export
insurance and fight tax evasion, the Moroccan news agency MAP
said.


They were signed by Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Euripides
Stylianidis and  the Moroccan Foreign Trade Minister Mustapha
Mechahouri in Rabat on Monday and Tuesday.


Commercial exchange between the two countries "remains weak",
said Mechahouri in a report. Trade figures rose from 47.8 million
euros (63.5 million dollars) in 2001 to 107.61 millions euros in
2006.
