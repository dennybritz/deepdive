Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo, freed Monday after
being held for two weeks by the Taliban in Afghanistan, arrived
in Rome late Tuesday on an Italian military plane to be welcomed
by his wife and two children.


Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Mastrogiacomo's boss, La
Repubblica director Ezio Mauro, were also present to greet him
when he arrived at Ciampino airport.


Mastrogiacomo had told Monday how he was forced to watch his
Afghan chauffeur being beheaded by their suspected Taliban
abductors.


Mastrogiacomo, 52, said in interviews with the Italian media
after his release on Monday that he was bound by his hands and
feet and feared execution at any moment during his two-week
hostage ordeal in Afghanistan.


He said the death of his chauffeur had been the most terrifying
moment of his captivity.


"I saw him being decapitated, it was horrific," the journalist
for told the TG3 televisions channel.


The driver had "his eyes covered and he was on his knees with his
hands tied behind his back," Mastrogiacomo said in the interview.


Mastrogiacomo, his interpreter and driver were abducted on March
4 in Helmand, a Taliban stronghold. The militia accused the
journalist of spying for Britain and announced last week through
an Afghan news agency that the driver had been "executed" for
spying. His interpreter Adjmal Nashkbandi was also freed Monday,
the Italian foreign ministry said.
