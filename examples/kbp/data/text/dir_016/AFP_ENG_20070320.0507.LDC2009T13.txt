Former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will not be
traveling to South Africa for an appearance in May despite
reports he planned to attend a boxing tournament, his agent said
Tuesday.


Harlan Werner said Tyson would not appear at Emperors Palace on
May 12, adding that a South African firm approached him about
securing Tyson but nothing came of the one conversation on the
matter.


"Mike never had a deal in place with any South African company to
appear on their behalf," Werner said. "These were unfounded
rumors, and it is unfortunate that these types of rumors get
started."


Tyson did not want supporters to be disappointed or misled by
rumors he would be appearing.


"Mike does have a very loyal following in Africa and he wants all
his fans to know he looks forward to going there some day in the
future," Werner said.
