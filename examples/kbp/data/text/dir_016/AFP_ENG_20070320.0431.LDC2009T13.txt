Another two journalists have been killed and two media workers
are missing in Iraq, press freedom group Reporters Without
Borders (RSF) said on Tuesday.


The body of Hamid al-Duleimi, 37, a producer for television
channel Al-Nahrain was found in a Baghdad morgue on Monday after
he was abducted two days earlier as he left the channel's
studios, a statement said.


"Autopsy reports revealed that the journalist had been tortured.
Two other employees of the channel were killed in May 2006 after
being stopped at a fake military roadblock in the Iraqi capital,"
RSF said.


The statement said the editor of the daily As-Safir, Hussein al-
Jaburi, 63, died from his injuries in a hospital last Friday in
Amman, where he was taken for treatment after being ambushed
outside his Baghdad home on February 11.


RSF said there has been no news of Karim Manhal, 48, a
commentator on Radio Dijla, who was snatched from his car by four
armed and masked men outside the radio's studios with his driver,
Thamir Sabri.


"There has been no claim of responsibility for the kidnapping,"
RSF said, without specifying when the abductions took place.


The latest deaths bring to 155 the number of media staff killed
since the invasion of Iraq by a US-led force four years ago.
