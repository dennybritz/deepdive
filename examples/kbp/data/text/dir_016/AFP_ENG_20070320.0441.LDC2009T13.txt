President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday decreed Wednesday a national
day of mourning in memory of at least 175 people killed over the
last four days in three separate disasters.


On Wednesday flags across the country will be flown at half-mast
and television and radio companies asked to take entertainment
programming off air.


The decree expresses "sorrow for the dead and condolences for
their relatives and loved ones."


Russia has suffered three major emergency incidents in just four
days.


The most deadly was a coal mine blast on Monday in Siberia. At
least 106 people have been killed, the worst death toll in a
mining accident since the Soviet collapse of 1991.


Another 62 people, nearly all of the elderly Russian pensioners,
died on Tuesday in a night blaze at their residential home in the
Krasnodar region of southern Russia.


Last Saturday, seven people died and 50 were injured when a
passenger jet crashed on landing in the central city of Samara,
the latest blow to the country's aviation industry still reeling
from its deadliest year on record in 2006.
