A former Serbian spy chief told a court on Tuesday that he met
two men suspected of organising the murder of Serbia's prime
minister Zoran Djindjic in 2003.


Aco Tomic, a former head of army intelligence, was speaking at
his first appearance in the trial of the former commander of an
elite paramilitary unit who is charged with organising the 2003
assassination of Djindjic.


Lawyers for the family of Djindjic, a reformer and pro-Western
leader, argue the killing was politically motivated and inspired
by then president Vojislav Kostunica and his inner circle.


Tomic told the court that Milorad "Legija" Ulemek, the alleged
mastermind of the killing, and Dusan Spasojevic, whose crime gang
carried out the shooting, had come to his office in 2002, Beta
news agency reported.


Spasojevic was killed in a shootout with police days after
Djindjic was shot dead in March 2003.


In his testimony, Tomic admitted to having accepted the gift of a
mobile telephone from Spasojevic at the meeting.


Djindjic was a reformist who led the first democratic Serbian
government after Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic was
overthrown in a popular uprising on October 5, 2000.


The court has already rejected a request by a Djindjic family
lawyer for Kostunica, currently prime minister, and several other
officials including Interior Minister Dragan Jocic to appear in
the trial as witnesses.


The prosecution said Ulemek and others had planned Djindjic's
murder to ovethrow his government and bring Milosevic's forces
back to power. Five suspects still remain at large.
