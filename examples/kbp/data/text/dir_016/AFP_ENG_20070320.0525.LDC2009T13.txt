US President George W. Bush urged Americans Tuesday to drive
hybrid automobiles that use less gasoline and said Congress
should pass his energy plan by the May 31 start of summer
driving.


"See, I believe that when you're dependent on oil from parts of
the world where people may not necessarily like us, that creates
a national security problem," he told workers at a Ford Motors
factory here that makes hybrids.


Against the backdrop of a hybrid pickup truck, Bush reassured
Americans accustomed to big powerful cars that a more
environmentally friendly vehicle "doesn't have to look like a
golf cart if you're running on electricity."


"It can be a normal size vehicle that people like to drive.
Texans like to use pickup trucks, as you well know. And it makes
sense to have these technologies fit in the kind of trucks that
people like to drive," he said.


The president, who has assailed US dependency on oil from the
Middle East, also urged the US Congress to approve his energy
plan, saying it was a matter of "national security" to wean the
US economy off foreign petroleum.


Bush has proposed setting mandatory fuel requirements that would
result in quintupling the current consumption of renewable and
alternative fuels to 35 billion gallons (133 billion liters) by
2017.


He has also said fuel economy standards for cars need to be
tightened to reduce gasoline consumption.
