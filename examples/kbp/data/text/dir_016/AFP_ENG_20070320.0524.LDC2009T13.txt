British novelist Jeffrey Archer and Vatican theologist Francis
Maloney on Tuesday launched a book defending Judas' betrayal of
Jesus at a papal institution in Rome.


"The Gospel According to Judas" claims the disciple acted over
concern that Jesus' failure to chase the Romans out of Jerusalem
would lead to the destruction of the Jewish people.


Its publication follows last year's discovery of an ancient
Coptic manuscript known as the Gospel of Judas, which maintains
that Jesus actually asked his disciple to betray him.


It was launched at the Vatican-funded Pontifical Biblical
Institute in Rome two days before its worldwide distribution on
Thursday.


The institute's rector, Father Stephen Pisano, was quoted by the
Ansa agency as saying he hoped the book would encourage more
people to read the Bible.


The book has been written from the point of view of Judas' son,
Benjamin Iscariot. As well as describing the betrayal, it rejects
claims the disciple later killed himself.


Archer, a successful novelist who was a conservative party
lawmaker before being jailed for four years for perjury in 2001,
said in January that the book was "a gospel, not a short story
and not a novel".


Australian scholar Maloney is an expert on Christian texts and a
member of the Vatican's International Theological Commission,
where he rubbed shoulders with Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope
Benedict XVI.
