The US Senate on Tuesday passed legislation meant to ensure the
independence of US attorneys, amid a growing scandal over the
Justice Department's firing of eight federal attorneys.


The "Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act," which
passed by a vote of 94 to two, would ensure that individuals
nominated to the powerful federal prosecutor posts on an interim
basis would serve a maximum 120 days. A permanent replacement for
the post would be subject to Senate confirmation.


"This bill will go a long way toward restoring the independence
of federal prosecutors," said Democratic Senator Ken Salazar, a
key backer of the legislation.


At present, an individual named to fill a federal prosecutor
vacancy can serve indefinitely.


Democrats allege that the eight US attorneys were fired because
they either investigated Republicans or declined to prosecute
Democrats.


The ousted prosecutors were replaced with individuals deemed more
likely to pursue prosecutions to the liking of President George
W. Bush's adminstration, in what has become one of the most
explosive scandals of the Bush presidency.


The controversy has led to calls for the resignation of US
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, the country's top cop.
Democrats allege Gonzales was a major architect of the
controversial policy on US attorney firings.
