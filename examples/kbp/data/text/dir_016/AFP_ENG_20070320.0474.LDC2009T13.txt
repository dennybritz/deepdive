Private satellite carrier SpaceX will launch its Falcon 1 rocket
into space from the Marshall Islands Tuesday, nearly a year after
its first attempt failed, the company said in a statement.


"The flight readiness review conducted shows all systems are 'go'
for a launch attempt but the launch could be delayed if we have
even the tiniest concern," chief executive Elon Musk said in the
statement.


Space Exploration Technologies, better known as SpaceX, is
shooting for a four- hour launch window opening at 2300 GMT at
its Pacific Ocean launch pad at the US Kwajalein military base in
the Marshall Islands, the company said.


SpaceX has pushed back the launch time for the second attempt on
several occasions for technical and safety problems.


SpaceX was founded by Internet billionaire Musk in 2002. The
second attempt is being financed by the US Defense Department's
Defense Advanced Research Agency.


A fuel leak sparked a fire that destroyed a Falcon 1 rocket on
the first attempted launch, SpaceX said.


The 21-meter (70-foot) two-stage rocket burned up in March 2006
just after launch at the US military base.


The rocket was propelled normally through takeoff by its mix of
liquid oxygen and kerosene, but high-definition images showed
that a fire broke out seconds after lift-off in the first stage
of the vehicle.


SpaceX has signed at least nine contracts to launch satellites
worth 200 million dollars.
