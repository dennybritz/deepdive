Fidel Castro, who has been recovering since intestinal surgery he
underwent almost eight months ago, could return to lead communist
Cuba "soon," a top cabinet member said Tuesday.


"What we are expecting is that we will have him back (at work)
with us, in a more active way, soon," Communist Party Politburo
member and Basic Industry Minister Yadira Garcia told reporters.


Castro, 80, handed over power for the first time in more than
four decades in July to his brother and regime number-two Raul
Castro, 75, following the surgery.


"Our comandante is recovering, his recovery process is making
progress," Garcia said. "I would say that he is already with the
leadership that agrees on the main issues, and the country's most
important decisions. And he also very involved in all these
areas: oil and energy, on which he always has been in the lead."


"We have been receiving his direction, the instructions he gives,
and the outlook is very good, very favorable," added Garcia, in
an unusual level of detail on Castro's health which Cuba regards
as a state secret.
