The autopsy into the death of Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer
has proven inconclusive, police officials said on Tuesday.


Further tests will be carried out, they added, on the body of
Woolmer who died on Sunday at the age of 58.


"The pathologist's findings were inconclusive," Pakistan team
media manager PJ Mir confirmed.


"He is awaiting the results of toxicology and histology tests
from the national laboratory and the government forensic
laboratory.


"The body of Bob Woolmer has been taken to a local funeral
parlour and arrangements are being made for the shipment of the
body to Cape Town via London."


Woolmer's body is expected to be carried on the same plane which
will take the Pakistan team home on Saturday.


Pakistan, who were knocked out of the World Cup after losing to
Ireland on Saturday, play their final game of the tournament
against Zimbabwe at Sabina Park here on Wednesday.
