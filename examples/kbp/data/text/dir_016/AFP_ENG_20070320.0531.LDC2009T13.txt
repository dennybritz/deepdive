In a protest against racism, more than 500 Belgian couples are to
symbolically wed Wednesday in a small Flemish town where three
couples had refused to allow a black official help them tie the
knot.


The "wedding ceremony" will take place at the Grand Place in the
town of Saint- Nicolas, near the northern city of Antwerp, under
the guidance of Wouter Van Bellingen, a deputy mayor of Rwandan
origin.


Van Bellingen, 34, speaks Flemish with an Antwerp accent and was
elected last October. But his period in office was quickly soured
when three couples cancelled their wedding plans rather than have
him lead the ceremonies.


"Racism has never really been a surprise for me," he told AFP.
"But I think this is more their problem than mine."


He has been surprised, however, by the public support for him.


At least 2,000 letters and emails have poured in since his story
made headlines at the beginning of February.


Wednesday's events are to start with hundreds of people joining
together in the "world's biggest cuddle" before exchanging vows
-- or renewing them for some -- with Van Bellingen's help.


A "multi-cultural buffet" has been planned to round off the day.
