England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff's wife Rachael and their two
children will fly to the West Indies next week to be with the
maligned cricketer at the World Cup, the Daily Mirror said on
Wednesday.


In an interview with the tabloid, Rachael, a 28-year-old model,
said the first thing she will say to her husband is: "Stupid
bugger!"


Flintoff, the star of England's 2005 Ashes success, was one of
six players fined following a late-night drinking session after a
six-wicket defeat by New Zealand on Friday.


He was also stripped of the vice-captaincy and dropped for the
team's match against Canada.


His alcohol-fuelled exploits culminated in him being helped to
shore after falling off a pedalo.


Flintoff's wife defended him, however, telling the Mirror:
"Andrew is extremely hard-working and extremely loyal."


"What you see is what you get. You can see how hard-working he is
with his cricket. He can be in complete pain and covered in
blisters and will still keep going for five more days."


Flintoff has received several warnings about his off-field
behaviour in the past, most recently while captaining England
during their 5-0 Ashes thrashing in Australia when Michael
Vaughan was injured.


But he said being dropped meant he would, unlike previous
occasions, make good on his promises to change his ways.
