The US group Tyson Foods produces nearly as much greenhouse gas
emissions as a major car manufacturer, according to a study by a
Swiss environmental ratings agency released on Wednesday.


The Centre Info study said the impact was partly down to the US
group's focus on meat products, an environmental quarterly,
LaRevueDurable, reported.


Tyson produced 1,600 units of carbon dioxide under the rating's
scale, compared to just over 2,000 for cleaner rated car
companies like Renault or Fiat, and about 900 for dairy group
Danone.


The Centre Info rating factors in the entire life cycle of
products, taking into account items like forest clearance for
grazing land, emissions from cattle feed, meat processing and the
large amounts of methane naturally produced by cattle.


Producing one kilo of cut veal produces as much greenhouse gas
emissions as travelling 220 kilometres (137 miles) by car, the
magazine said.


However, meat from non ruminants turns out to be more
environmentally friendly.


One kilo of pork is equivalent to a car journey of just 20
kilometres, while a kilogramme of chicken is worth just 10
kilometres.


Dairy products are slightly higher up the scale. A kilogramme of
yoghurt pumps out as much as driving eight kilometres, the
magazine said.
