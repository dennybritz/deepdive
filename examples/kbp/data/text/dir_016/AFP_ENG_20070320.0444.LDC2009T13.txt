Valdas Ivanauskas on Tuesday became the third head coach to quit
Hearts in the last 18 months after leaving the Scottish Premier
League club "by mutual consent."


The Lithuanian's departure had been expected following Hearts
majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov's recent decision to
replace him "temporarily" with Anatoly Korobochka.


Ivanauskas took over as head coach in March 2006, succeeding
Graham Rix who was himself sacked by Romanov less than than six
months after taking over from George Burley.


Ivanauskas, who took two weeks off last October because of
unspecified health problems, told the club's website that he had
been proud to have served as Hearts coach.


"In my career as a young coach, it has been my best and most
interesting experience," he said.


Ivanauskas guided Hearts to victory in last season's Scottish Cup
but he leaves with the club lying fourth in the SPL table and
with little prospect of catching second-placed Rangers in the
race for a place in the Champions League qualifying competition
next season.
