England fans' trip to Israel to watch the Euro 2008 qualifier in
Tel-Aviv on Saturday has been thrown into doubt by the
possibility of a general strike in the country.


It was expected that Israel would come to a halt on Wednesday as
more than 400,000 state workers took industrial action in protest
at the delayed payment of salaries.


Israel's powerful workers' union Histadrut has already confirmed
the England team's plane will be allowed to land but it was not
clear if the fans themselves would have such free passage.


"The English team will be allowed to land, but the Histadrut
(workers' union) has not yet authorised the arrival of the planes
carrying the fans," an airport authority spokesman told AFP.


Four days after the Israel game, England play Andorra in
Barcelona in another Group E game and poor performances would
jeopardise their chances of competing in the finals in Austria
and Switzerland next year.
