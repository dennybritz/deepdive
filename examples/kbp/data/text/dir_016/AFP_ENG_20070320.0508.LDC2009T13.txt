The European Union made its first official contact on Tuesday
with a member of the new Palestinian unity government, EU foreign
policy chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman confirmed.


She said that the EU's Middle East envoy, Marc Otte, held talks
in Gaza City with Palestinian foreign minister Ziad Abu Amr, who
is an independent member of the cabinet, grouping Western-backed
moderates and Islamic radicals.


The spokeswoman gave no details about their meeting.


The militant group Hamas, which stunningly swept to power a year
ago, is on the EU's terror black list and the bloc has refused to
meet its members.


The EU, in line with the Middle East diplomatic Quartet, of which
it is a member, refuses to lift a financial embargo on the
Palestinian cabinet until it recognises Israel, renounces
violence and respects past peace agreements.


France, Austria and Belgium have also announced the first
tentative steps toward resuming contacts with members of the new
unity government who are not part of Hamas.
