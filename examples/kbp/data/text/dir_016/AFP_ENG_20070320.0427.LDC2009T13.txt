British bank Barclays outlined plans Tuesday  for a merger with
Dutch peer ABN Amro but declined to give financial details of an
expected takeover offer for the company.


Talks between the banks were "at an early and exploratory stage"
and the plans were conditional on the two sides reaching an
agreement.


In a joint statement issued after the close of trading on
European stock markets, the banks said the new group would have
its main stock market listing in London with headquarters and
secondary listing in Amsterdam.


It would have a single management board, with the first chairman
nominated by ABN Amro and the chief executive named by Barclays.


The banks said they had begun talks with regulators to make the
Dutch Central Bank the lead regulator for their combined
operations.


"Talks are at an early and exploratory stage and there can be no
certainty that they will lead to a transaction or the form it
will take," the statement said.


Barclays had issued a statement late on Monday confirming that it
had entered exclusive talks with ABN Amro about a takeover.
