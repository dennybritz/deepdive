The bodies of two Algerian soldiers have been found in woods near
the capital, security officials said on Tuesday.


The pair had been stabbed though precise details of the incident
were not immediately known.


Their bodies were found close to army barracks in the Algiers
suburb of Beni Messous on Monday.


An unofficial version of events said the two men were part of a
drunken group who had taken a shortcut through the woods.
