A Russian court fined accountancy group PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC) 16.8 million rubles (484,000 euros, 645,000 dollars) on
Tuesday for its role in tax evasion by bankrupt oil group Yukos
in 2002-2004.


The case was brought against PwC by the Russian revenue service
last December and involved allegations that PwC had drawn up two
versions of the Yukos 2002 accounts: one for shareholders and
another for management.


PwC rejected the accusations at the end of 2006 and said on
Tuesday that it would appeal the decision.


Its Moscow offices were raided at the beginning of this month and
documents relating to the year 2002 were seized.


"We regret that the tribunal has taken this decision to uphold
the complaint of the revenue service ... we will appeal," a
statement from PwC said, according to the Interfax report.


Yukos collapsed under claims for tax arrears and its founder
Khodorkovsky is in prison for tax evasion.


Many observers suggested at the time of the demise that the moves
against the group had been inspired by political motives, given
Khodorkovsky's opposition to Putin.


Yukos was declared bankrupt in August 1 last year.
