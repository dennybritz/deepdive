Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said on Tuesday that the four-month
gap without playing an international match may have a negative
effect on his Azzurri side.


The world champions, whose last game was against Turkey last
November, host Scotland in Bari a week on Wednesday in a crucial
Group B Euro 2008 qualifier.


Italy should have played Romania in February but the match was
cancelled after a brief ban on all domestic and international
matches following crowd trouble at a league match in Catania
where a policeman was killed.


"I don't want to make excuses, but it's worth pointing out that
the national team has not played for four months and that's a big
disadvantage," said Donadoni at Italy's training camp in
Coverciano, Florence.


"The decision to stop matches was the right one, but not playing
against Romania has been a real handicap for us."


Donadoni, who took over at the helm after Marcello Lippi stepped
down following the World Cup, said he would be in Glasgow on
Saturday to see Scotland's Group B qualifier against Georgia.


"I want to see how they play under their new coach," Donadoni
said referring to Alex McLeish who took over from Walter Smith in
January.


"It's a big game as Scotland could have 12 points by the time
they face us."


Donadoni said he would trim his 25-man squad down to 20 on Friday
evening.


France - whom Italy beat in a penalty shootout in the World Cup
final - and Scotland are currently tied for top spot in Group B
on nine points, followed by Italy on seven points.
