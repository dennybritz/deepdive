The United States called on Cuba Tuesday to stop repression and
to free political prisoners, four years after Havana rounded up
and jailed 75 political dissidents.


Cuba is the only one-party communist regime in the Americas.


"In March 2003, the regime arrested members of Cuba's independent
civil society, rounding up 75 independent thinkers, journalists,
librarians, and academics," said State Department spokesman Sean
Mccormack in a statement.


"These individuals were sentenced to as many as 25 years in
prison for carrying out activities that citizens living in
democracies across the globe participate in every day.


"Four years later, 59 of the original 75 remain behind bars.
Those who have been released know that it is 'conditional' and
live with the constant threat of being sent back to jail. They
also know, as all Cubans do, that repression is on the rise,"
McCormack said.


"Cuba's future will be decided by the Cuban people. For this
process to begin, it is time for Cuban authorities to stop the
cycle of repression, to end the practice of holding political
prisoners, and to release all political prisoners to their homes
and families in Cuba," he said.
