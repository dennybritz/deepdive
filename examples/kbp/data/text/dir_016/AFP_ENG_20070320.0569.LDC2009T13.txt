Knee injuries to Houston defender Ricardo Clark and Chicago
striker Chris Rolfe forced changes to the US squad for upcoming
friendlies with Ecuador and Guatemala, US Soccer announced on
Tuesday.


Clark suffered a right knee ligament sprain in a 2-0 victory over
Mexico's Pachuca in the North American Champions Cup last week
and will be sidelined up to a month while Rolfe has a sprained
knee.


US interim coach Bob Bradley named a pair of Houston players,
defender Wade Barrett and midfielder Brian Mullan, to replace
them for matches on Sunday against Ecuador in nearby Tampa and
March 28 against Guatemala in Dallas.


There will be 11 members of the 2006 US World Cup squad in the
lineup for the matches, including Los Angeles Galaxy forward
Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey and Carlos Bocanegra of Fulham and
defender Oguchi Onyewu of Newcastle.


Kasey Keller of Borussia Monchengladbach and Everton's Tim Howard
are the top goalkeepers.
