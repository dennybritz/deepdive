The European Union's top anti-trust regulator said Tuesday she
expected to break up as many as nine or 10 cartels this year and
set a new record in annual fines handed out to offending firms.


After hitting seven cartels last year, 2006 was a "fruitful
year", although 2007 would be even better, Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes told the European Parliament.


"I wouldn't be surprised if the number of cartel rulings in 2007
reaches that in 2001 and 2002," she said, adding that it would
bring the tally to "nine or 10."


EU regulators, in the midst of major drive against cartels,
slapped a record 1.8 billion euros (2.4 billion dollars) in fines
on companies found to be in the illegal clubs in 2006.


That record is likely to be quickly surpassed this year because
Kroes's department has already imposed fines worth 1.7 billion
euros in just two cases -- and more are in the works.


"I fear (the total fines are) going to be very high and beat the
record again," she said.


Kroes said she was "saddened" by the number of cartels being
uncovered and looked "forward to the day when my services come to
me and say that no matter how hard they have worked they have not
found a single cartel."


Since taking up her job as Europe's top antitrust regulator in
late 2004, the Dutch commissioner has made fighting cartels one
of the top priorities of her five-year term.


Her comments came hours after EU regulators took the first legal
steps against a cartel of professional videotape makers and less
than a week after launching a case against glassmakers.
