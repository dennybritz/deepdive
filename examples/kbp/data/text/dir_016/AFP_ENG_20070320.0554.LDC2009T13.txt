A Man who ripped out his wife's eyes in a fit of rage was
sentenced by a French court to 30 years behind bars on Tuesday.


Mohamed Hadfi, 31, tore out his 23-year-old wife Samira Bari's
eyes following a heated argument in their apartment in the
southern French city of Nimes in July 2003 after she refused to
have sex with him.


Bari, who had demanded a divorce before the attack, was
permanently blinded.


Hadfi, a Moroccan, initially fled to Germany. He was finally
arrested and sent back to France, where he was indicted for "acts
of torture and barbarity leading to a permanent disability".


Prosecutor Dominique Tourette demanded that Hadfi be sentenced to
30 years in prison, two thirds of which must be served in full,
calling the defendant a "diabolic torturer".


Once his sentence is served, Hadfi will be deported and barred
from ever returning to France.


His lawyer Jean-Pierre Cabanes meanwhile insisted there were
extenuating circumstances.


"This is the result of a marriage that was arranged, not chosen,"
he said, pointing to the gulf separating his client, who came
from southern Morocco, and his young wife, who had grown up in
France.


Cabanes begged the jury for leniency, claiming his client's
action "appeared to stem from a mental illness."
