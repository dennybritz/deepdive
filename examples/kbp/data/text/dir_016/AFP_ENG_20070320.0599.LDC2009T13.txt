Daniel Vettori hopes his emergence as a world-class off-spinner
can help propel New Zealand to a first World Cup title.


The 28-year-old left-armer is playing in his third World Cup but
has yet to leave his mark on the competition.


After taking 2-45 on Tuesday to help the Black Caps to a 148-run
win over Kenya and into the Super Eights, Vettori stressed that
he has a major role to play in the Caribbean.


"I'm probably a better bowler now than I was in 1999 and 2003 and
a lot more is expected of me," said Vettori after taking his
career one-day tally to 189 wickets.


"Shane Bond and myself are the strike bowlers and we both have to
live up to it if we want to do well."


Vettori believes he has the variety to trouble the tournament's
batsmen.


"I bowled a lot of arm balls today because the conditions were
quite slippery," he said.


"It was hard to get turn on the ball and against teams like this,
they try to slog you first and block later, so you try and get it
under the bat.


"I'm struggling to buy a decision at the moment but the team are
coming along quite nicely and it's two out of two," added Vettori
referring to wins over England and Kenya which have guaranteed
the Black Caps a place in the Super Eights.
