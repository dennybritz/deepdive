Democrats in the US Congress introduced legislation Tuesday to
fight corruption in the US reconstruction effort in Iraq, which
has been riddled with fraud and waste.


They said their "Iraq Reconstruction Improvement Act" would
increase accountability and oversight of American reconstruction
projects in Iraq.


"Reconstruction has been beset by gross corruption and massive
American and Iraqi bureaucratic confusion," said Democratic
Representative Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, and the bill's main author.


"The Iraqi people, hoping that the fall of Saddam would bring
peace and prosperity to their country, have instead been handed
half-built hospitals, failed water projects, and a power grid
that is more off than on," he said.


"It is unacceptable that we have failed to deliver the basic
services that would allow Iraqis to live dignified, peaceful
lives."


His bill would increase monitoring of reconstruction efforts in
Iraq and would expand the powers of the Special Inspector General
for Iraq Reconstruction, among other enhanced oversight measures.


"Conscience demands that we consider not only how our country
conducts itself in Iraq and how and when our troops will come
home, but also what we leave behind," said Lantos.


"This legislation creates accountability for our efforts to set
Iraq back on its feet," he said.
