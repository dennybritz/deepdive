Glen Davis, the bulky big man better known as "Big Baby" to
college basketball rivals, announced here Tuesday he will skip
his final season to join the National Basketball Association.


Fifteen years after Shaquille O'Neal announced he was skipping
his senior season at Louisiana State University, Davis followed
in the footsteps of the Miami Heat superstar who has won four NBA
titles.


Davis has career totals of 1,587 points, 916 rebounds and 110
blocks, joining "Shaq" as the only Louisiana State players with
such lofty numbers in all three categories.


"This is a move I want to do and am ready to do," Davis said.
"This is a dream of mine and one that I have given a great deal
of thought. I feel I grew a lot this season and I know in my
heart the time is right."


Davis, a wide 2.04m center with quick moves, averages 17.7 points
and 10.4 rebounds in 29 games this season.


But the Tigers were a disappointing 17-15 this season after
reaching the US college semi-finals in 2006, when Davis was the
Southeastern Conference Player of the Year with 18.6 points and
9.7 rebounds a game.


"I was fortunate to be on one of LSU's four Final Four teams,"
Davis said. "One of my reasons for not leaving last year was my
hope I could go even further this year. Unfortunately, that
didn't happen.


"After one of the toughest years I have had mentally and
physically, I feel I am ready mentally and physically to play in
the NBA."
