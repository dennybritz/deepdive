Conservative members of the German parliament launched a bid on
Tuesday to strengthen rules to prevent English words being used
in signs at rail stations and other public places.


The members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), which forms one half of the coalition
government, have taken particular aim at German rail operator
Deutsche Bahn.


In German stations, travellers are directed to a "Service-Point"
and can rent a bicycle from "Call a Bike", but the MPs say many
Germans cannot understand the signs.


"We need a wider form of consumer protection based on the
understanding of language," said a statement from lawmakers Julia
Kloeckner, Laurenz Meyer, Erika Steinbach and Gitta Connemann.


If consumers fail to understand the language used in signs, "they
feel limited and can no longer participate" in daily life, the
MPs said.


Deutsche Bahn rejected the criticism.


"We operate on an international level," a spokesman said.
