Brandon Stokley, a receiver who missed most of the Super Bowl
championship season for the Indianapolis Colts with an injury,
signed a one-year contract with the Denver Broncos here on
Tuesday.


Stokley becomes the fourth player to leave the Colts since their
29-17 victory over Chicago in Super Bowl 41 last month, following
linebacker Cato June, cornerback Nick Harper and running back
Dominic Rhodes.


A torn Achilles tendon limited Stokley to eight catches for 85
yards and one touchdown in three games for the Colts last term.


Stokley, 30, set career highs with 68 catches for 1,077 yards and
10 touchdowns in 2004 with the Colts.


Stokley spent his first four seasons with Baltimore and the past
four at Indianapolis. His 38-yard touchdown reception opened the
scoring in Baltimore's 34-7 rout of the New York Giants in the
2001 Super Bowl.
