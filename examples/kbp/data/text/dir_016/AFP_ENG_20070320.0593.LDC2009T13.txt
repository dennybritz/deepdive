Police in Britain said Tuesday they had agreed to provide the
Church of Scientology, which includes Tom Cruise and John
Travolta among its celebrity members, with special security
information.


"Church of Scientology asked to be placed on a database of groups
and individuals that are provided with regular information
bulletins from the Metropolitan Police," a spokeswoman told AFP.


It has also been placed in a database of organisations whose
contact details, if requested, will be passed along to victims of
crime or in the aftermath of an emergency for support.


The Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said the Church of
Scientology, which is regarded with suspicion in many European
countries, would not be receiving any "confidential or sensitive
material".


Founded in the United States in 1954 by science-fiction writer L.
Ron Hubbard, Scientology was accorded the status of religion
there in 1993, and even enjoys a tax exemption.


The Church of Scientology, which is accused by its opponents of
manipulating members for financial ends, says it is working for a
world free of "war, crime and insanity". It is against psychiatry
and anti-drugs.
