President George W. Bush Tuesday vowed to resist any attempt by
Congress to compel testimony under oath by top aides in a row
over fired prosecutors, warning against a "partisan fishing
expedition."


"I will oppose any attempts to subpoena White House officials,"
Bush said in a statement from the White House.


The administration earlier agreed to let key figures in the drama
like Bush's key political advisor Karl Rove meet congressional
investigators, but not to testify under oath.


But Bush vowed "we will not go along with a partisan fishing
expedition."
