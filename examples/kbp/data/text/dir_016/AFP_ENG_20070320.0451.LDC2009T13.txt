Bermuda teenage seamer Malachi Jones admitted that he was so
overjoyed with taking a wicket with his first World Cup delivery
that he couldn't help bursting into tears.


Jones, the third youngest player to feature in the World Cup,
claimed the wicket of India opener Robin Uthappa with his very
first delivery at the Queen's Park Oval on Monday.


Giant Dwayne Leverock, all 255 pounds (116kg) of him, dived to
his right to pouch the chance.


"I knew it wasn't going to be easy. I just tried to get my line
and length. But I couldn't believe getting a wicket with my first
ball," said Jones.


Jones's mother and grandmother were at the ground to witness his
big moment.


"I was up all last night and couldn't sleep because all I wanted
was to see Malachi to do something special," grandmother Winnie
told the Bermuda Royal Gazette.


"But I never expected he would do anything like this. I am so
proud of Malachi and this has certainly made my vacation."


Despite the family celebrations, the final outcome of the Group B
match was enough to make anyone weep as India romped to 413-5,
the highest ever World Cup total made.


The winning margin of 257 runs was also the biggest in one-day
internationals.
