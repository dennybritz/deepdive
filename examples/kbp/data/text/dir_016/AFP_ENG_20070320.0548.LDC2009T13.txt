Eighteen US Olympians will visit elementary and middle school
students in hurricane-ravaged New Orleans next month and present
some much-needed sports equipment to 10 schools.


The US Olympic Committee announced Tuesday that the athletes
would take part in Project Rebound on April 20 to help children
still coping with the aftermath of the deadly storm Katrina.


Walter Davis, the 2006 world indoor and 2005 world outdoor triple
jump champion, and Tom Dolan, a 1996 and 2000 Olympic 400m
individual medley swim champion, are among those who will speak
with students.


"It provides us with an opportunity to help the schools and
students most affected by the hurricane," said Olympian Courtney
Johnson, a 2000 US water polo Olympian.


"(We) are excited about meeting and interacting with the students
in the 'Recovery School District' as they continue to heal."
