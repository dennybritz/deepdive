A Leipzig court ruled on Tuesday that two Iraqi political asylum-
seekers could remain in Germany due to the increasing violence in
Iraq.


The Iraqis obtained asylum in 1997 and 2002 but it was withdrawn
in 2005 by the German immigration office, who argued that the
fall of Hussein in 2003 would change the political situation.


However the court ruled that due to the increasing violence in
Iraq their asylum status could be prolonged.
