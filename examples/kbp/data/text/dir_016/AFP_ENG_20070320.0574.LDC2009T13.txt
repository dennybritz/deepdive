Children treated for leukemia face a higher risk of developing
other cancers later in life, according to a new study Tuesday.


While children hit with acute lymphoblastic leukemia -- one of
the most common childhood cancers -- show high cure and high
survival rates after treatment, the chance that they will come
down with a secondary cancer within 30 years of their treatment
is significantly higher than the general population, according to
a summary of the study.


The study of 2,169 young patients treated for leukemia between
1962 and 1998 by Dr. Nobuko Hijiya of St. Jude's Children's
Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, found that among the
1,290 patients who remained in complete remission, 123 subjects,
or 9.5 percent, developed a second cancer.


Cancer reappeared in 4.17 percent of those patients within 15
years of their treatment. After 20 years, 5.37 percent were
affected by cancer, and 10.85 percent after 30 years.


The cancers most often seen in these patients were meningioma, a
tumor near the brain and spinal cord, and basal cell carcinoma,
the most common form of skin cancer.


"The risk for high-grade tumors, especially carcinomas,
significantly exceeds the risk in the general population,
underscoring the need for continued careful followup of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia survivors," the study's authors said in
the summary.


The study will be published in the March 21 edition of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
