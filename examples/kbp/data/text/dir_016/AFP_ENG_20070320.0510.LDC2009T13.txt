A fire swept through a downtown Cairo shanty town Tuesday,
destroying a stretch of wooden huts and leaving some 1,000 people
homeless, security sources said.


A gas cylinder explosion in one of the huts most likely caused
the blaze, the source said, adding that it spread quickly because
of strong winds.


It took emergency services about four hours to extinguish the
fire in the Qalaat al-Kabash neighbourhood, with 10 residents
suffering minor burns.


Residents who lost their homes will be placed in temporary
housing, the source said.
