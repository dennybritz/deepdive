Hong Kong share prices opened 0.12 percent higher Wednesday as
investors took positions in China Mobile on expectations the
company will report strong earnings results today, dealers said.


They said investors also expect Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa
to report strong earnings due out Thursday.


However, some caution lingered capping the market's overall rise
ahead of the US Fed decision later Wednesday on interest rates,
they added.


The Hang Seng Index opened up 24.08 points at 19,380.98.
