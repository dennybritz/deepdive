The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said in a statement on
Tuesday they had made a request to take up civil action involving
Spain's "Operation Puerto" scandal.


Spain's judiciary decided to throw out the case on March 12
though state prosecutors appealed that decision two days later.


Last year's probe uncovered an alleged doping network said to
involve 58 cyclists from a total of 200 sportsmen and women.


Revelations implicating top cyclists led to several yellow jersey
favourites being suspended by their teams two days prior to the
2006 Tour de France.


Ivan Basso of Italy and Germany's 1997 Tour winner Jan Ullrich
were among over a dozen riders pulled out of the race for
allegedly being directly or indirectly involved in the affair.


Olivier Niggli, WADA's director of legal affairs, told AFP on
Tuesday if WADA's civil action was given the go-ahead, they would
work hand in hand with the sport's world governing body, the UCI,
to get to the bottom of the case.


However doubts remain about whether WADA would get access to any
information after the judge said it could not be used by sporting
authorities to punish athletes because the criminal inquiry had
not been completed.
