German Andreas Kloden of the Astana team retained his overall
lead after the seventh and final stage to win the 42nd Tirreno-
Adriatico cycling race on Tuesday.


Koldo Fernandez of the Euskaltel team won the 177km stage between
Civitella del Tronto and San Benedetto del Tronto in 4hr 38mins
43secs after a bunch sprint. It was the Spaniard's first win
since he turned professional in 2004.


Australian Stuart O'Grady came in second and Italian Gabriele
Balducci was third.


Italian sprint king Alessandro Petacchi was a notable absentee at
the finish line after another competitor fell in front of him.


"At about two kilometres from the finish line there was a fall in
front of me," he explained.


"Thankfully I wasn't involved, but it spoiled my finish."


Kloden finished top of the overall standings with a time of
28:31:26.


Luxembourg's Kim Kirchen was second and Alexander Vinokourov of
Kazakhstan was third.


The Tirreno-Adriatico race runs between the Tyrrhenian and
Adriatic coasts and is an important warm-up for the Milan-San
Remo classic race, which takes place on March 24.
