A UN convoy heading to the Somali capital Mogadishu was attacked
on Tuesday when gunmen set off a roadside bomb and then opened
fire, wounding three policemen, officials said.


The bomb exploded near the town of Afgoye, about 30 kilometres
(18 miles) south of Mogadishu. Three policemen escorting the
convoy were injured but the two United Nations staff escaped
unharmed, a police official told AFP.


Witnesses confirmed the incident, which came as African Union
Commissioner for Peace and Security Said Djinnit held talks with
Somali leaders in Mogadishu, where at least 1,500 Ugandan
peacekeepers are deployed.
