A court in Algiers sentenced an Islamist to 20 years in jail in
absentia for membership of a terrorist group and attacks on the
state, the Algerian APS news agency reported on Tuesday.


Kamel Sebane was one of several Islamists to be condemned by the
Algerian courts in the past few weeks.


Also on Tuesday, the same court postponed the trial of suspected
Islamist Boudiaf Nourredine, alias Abou Othmane and Abou Hakim,
until its next session in May or June because he did not have a
defence lawyer.


Noureddine, who has been in jail since 1995, is accused of mass
murder, sabotage, membership of a terrorist group, attacks on the
state and on property, possession of illegal weapons and forgery.
