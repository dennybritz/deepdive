A former Serbian transport minister and eleven others have been
charged with embezzlement linked to the reconstruction of
Belgrade airport, local media reported on Tuesday.


Marija Raseta Vukosavljevic was charged with "misuse of power"
during the reconstruction of a VIP lounge and an airport
terminal, deputy prosecutor Sasa Ivanic told Serbian state
television.


Raseta Vukosavljevic served as transport minister from 2000 to
2003 in the government of assassinated prime minister Zoran
Djindjic.


The then transport minister and several other officials -- among
them a former airport manager, his deputy and two executives of
the companies in charge of the reconstruction -- were briefly
detained in November 2004, but were soon released pending
judicial investigation, Ivanic said.


All were suspected of embezzlement worth 220 million dinars (2.8
million euros, 3.7 million dollars) during works performed at
Belgrade airport up to April 2004.


The reconstruction of the airport, damaged badly by the 1999 NATO
bombing campaign, was a top priority of the reformist Serbian
leadership after the fall of former strongman Slobodan Milosevic
in October 2000.


Despite international financial assistance, work has been
dragging on for more than six years, and the airport -- the main
international gateway in this former Yugoslav republic -- has
only been functioning at about 70 percent capacity.
