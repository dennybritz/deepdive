Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said Tuesday that Britain was
using every channel it can to secure the release of BBC reporter
Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped last week in Gaza City.


The 44-year-old was snatched at gunpoint on March 12 as he drove
home from work.


"For our part, we are using every channel and opportunity that we
can to try to secure his release," Beckett told parliament.


She said she had raised the disappearance with Palestinian
president Mahmud Abbas.


"I'm assured by President Abbas that it is very much a goal of
the Palestinian government and authorities," Beckett said.


"It's extremely important that we try to secure this and I think
it is particularly sad... when someone who has been a long-
standing friend of the people of Palestine suffers in this way
and it does nothing to help."


Beckett responded to calls in parliament for the release of
Johnston and Israeli soldier Corporal Gilad Shalit, who was taken
hostage in June.


"Few things could do more to breathe fresh life into the Middle
East peace process than the early release of Corporal Shalit and
indeed the BBC reporter Alan Johnston," she said.


Earlier, European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said
his officials had been "doing the utmost" to secure Johnston's
release.


On Monday, the BBC said it was "increasingly concerned" for
Johnston and called for a redoubling of efforts to find him.
