Australian singer Tina Arena is to star as Roxie Hart in the
London version of the musical "Chicago" for five weeks from April
2, the show's producers said Tuesday.


Arena, known for hits including "Chains" and "Burn", has already
starred in "Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" and
"Cabaret" in her home country.


Hart was played by US actress Renee Zellweger in the 2002 film
version of the classic show, written by John Kander and Fred Ebb
and choreographed by Bob Fosse.


In November, "Chicago" will celebrate its 10-year anniversary on
the London stage. The show is also currently playing in New York.
