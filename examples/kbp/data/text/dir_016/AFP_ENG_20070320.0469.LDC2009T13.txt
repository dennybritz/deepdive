Nigeria suffered a huge blow just days ahead of their 2008
African Nations Cup qualifier with Uganda when first choice
goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama was ruled out on Tuesday because of a
knee ligament injury.


"Enyeama has been ruled out of the game due to injury," team
spokesman Danusa Ocholi informed reporters.


Enyeama suffered the injury during a league game involving his
Israeli club Bnei-Yehuda at the weekend.


Enyeama, who has been Nigeria's number one choice in goal since
the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, is now likely to be
replaced by Austin Ejide, who plays for French second division
club Bastia.


Group Three leaders Nigeria host closest rivals Uganda on
Saturday in Abeokuta, southwest Nigeria.


The Super Eagles have recorded six points from two matches while
Uganda have four points. Niger and Lesotho are the other teams in
the group which will produce an automatic qualifier for the bi-
ennial competition to be staged by Ghana in January.
