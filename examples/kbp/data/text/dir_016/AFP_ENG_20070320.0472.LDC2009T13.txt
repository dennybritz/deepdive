Shares in Spanish carrier Iberia soared Tuesday in Madrid amid
signs EU transport ministers will Thursday clear plans to open up
the transatlantic aviation market to tougher competition.


Shares closed 8.81 percent higher at 3.58 euros while the Madrid
IBEX-35 index closed up 0.51 percent at 14,323.2 points.


Dealers said Iberia also benefited from takeover speculation.


Iberia, a partner of British Airways, and other major airlines
hopes the pending "open skies" agreement can take off after EU
and US negotiators hammered out a tentative deal at the beginning
of the month to liberalise transatlantic air traffic, a move
forecast to slash fares.


Last week, dealers had dampened speculation that the deal would
lift shares in Iberia, in which BA has a ten percent stake as
well as right of first refusal over a further 30 percent held by
the founders of the Spanish carrier.


Iberia is a member of the oneworld alliance which includes
American Airlines and British Airways and flies to over 100
destinations in more than 40 countries. It is the leading carrier
between Europe and Latin America.
