Federal Reserve policymakers opened a two-day meeting Tuesday
expected to keep interest rates steady, with financial markets
awaiting clues in the panel's policy statement to any future rate
moves.


A central bank spokesman said the Federal Open Market Committee,
headed by Ben Bernanke, began its meeting at 1830 GMT. A
statement from the panel was expected Wednesday at 1815 GMT.


Analysts say mixed signals on the US economy will induce
policymakers to keep the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent,
where it has been since August.


But some Fed-watchers say the FOMC may redraft its policy
statement to reflect the most recent economic developments.


In the past few weeks, the Fed has seen hotter-than-expected news
on the inflation front, but also signs of economic weakness,
especially in housing and manufacturing.


Some economists predict inflation will cool, as the Fed expects,
allowing the central bank to cut rates later this year. Others
are less certain.


The latest economic data "limits the Fed's room to manuever and
makes their life more complicated," said Nariman Behravesh, chief
economist at the research firm Global Insight.


"I think this will be reflected in the statement with a more
balanced outlook for the risks on inflation and growth,"
Behravesh added, saying he expected "a little more emphasis on
the weakness in housing."
