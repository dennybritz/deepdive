South Africa has extended by a year its peacekeeping troop
deployments to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Darfur and along
the Ethiopian-Eritrean border, the government announced Tuesday.


The cabinet approved the extension "as part of our commitment to
contribute to peace and stability on the continent, and to
fulfill our international obligations to the United Nations and
the African Union," said a statement issued after Tuesday's
fortnightly cabinet meeting in Cape Town.


The deployment of 750 troops to the troubled western Sudanese
region of Darfur, 1,264 to the DRC and 10 to the volatile border
between Ethiopia and Eritrea were all to have expired within the
next three months, government spokesman Themba Maseko said.


The term of 22 South African National Defence Force personnel
assisting with military integration and training in the DRC was
also extended by a year.


"The meeting further approved the deployment of five SANDF
personnel to be part of the UN Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN)
as military observers and staff officers," the statement said.
