A pilot from a recently deployed US aircraft carrier was rescued
shortly after ejecting from his fighter jet in the North Arabian
Sea on Tuesday, the Bahrain- based US Fifth Fleet said.


"A pilot assigned to Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 9 aboard USS John C.
Stennis (CVN 74) was rescued shortly after ejection Tuesday
afternoon from an aircraft in the North Arabian Sea," a statement
said.


The pilot was recovered 16 minutes after ejecting from his
F/A-18C Super Hornet and is in good condition, it said.


"The cause of the incident is currently under investigation," the
statement added.


In January, US President George W. Bush ordered the Stennis to
the Gulf to join another carrier battle group and announced the
deployment of a Patriot missiles to the region to protect allies
against potential missile strikes.


The buildup came amid mounting tension with Iran over its nuclear
programme, which Washington suspects is aimed at developing
nuclear weapons. Tehran denies the charge.


"The John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group is currently supporting
(the US-led anti-terror) Operation Enduring Freedom as well as
conducting Maritime Security Operations in the US 5th Fleet area
of operations," Tuesday's statement said.
