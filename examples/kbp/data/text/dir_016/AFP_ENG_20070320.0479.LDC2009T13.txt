The World Trade Organisation said Tuesday it would rule on
Ecuador's complaint about the European Union's banana import
rules.


The WTO's Disputes Settlement Body formally set up a panel to
consider the dispute at a meeting here after an EU veto against
the move earlier this month automatically lapsed. The process is
expected to take three months.


Ecuador formally lodged a complaint with the WTO last November.
It is the first such challenge to revised EU rules on banana
imports from outside the African- Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) zone
that took effect last year.


Ecuador's ambassador said earlier this month that the new 176
-euro-per-tonne customs duties had added 131 million dollars to
the country's export bill.


The EU's changed import policy was partly a response to a
landmark WTO ruling in favour of several Central American banana
exporters in 2001 that had forced Brussels to cut duties.


Citing EU statistics, Ecuador said its share of the EU banana
market had fallen to 27.5 percent in the first eight months of
2006, down from 29.9 percent in the corresponding period one year
earlier.


The United States supports Ecuador's claim, while the EU stance
is backed by ACP members such as the Dominican Republic, Saint
Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Cameroon.
