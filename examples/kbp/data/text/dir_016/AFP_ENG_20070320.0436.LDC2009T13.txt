The price of shares in British leisure group Whitbread soared by
more than 11 percent on Tuesday on speculation that a private
equity group was set to launch a takeover bid for the company,
dealers said.


At the close of trading, Whitbread stood at 1,934 pence, a rise
of 11.09 percent compared with Monday's closing price.


Dealers said investors were reacting to rumours that Whitbread
would face a private equity bid worth 2,300 pence per share, or
4.5 billion pounds (6.63 billion euros, 8.81 billion dollars).


One London-based anonymous dealer was sceptical, adding that the
market was being inundated with takeover stories.


"It's just people trying to create a bit of mischief," the dealer
said.


Whitbread owns hotels, restaurants as well as health and fitness
clubs, including Premier Travel Inn, Brewers Fayre, Beefeater,
Costa and David Lloyd Leisure.
