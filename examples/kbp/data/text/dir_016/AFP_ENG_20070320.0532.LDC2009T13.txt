Israel and the United States on Tuesday concluded a joint
computer-based exercise simulating a non-conventional missile
strike, military sources said.


The joint air-defence drill, called Juniper Cobra 2007, was
designed to improve "understanding and cooperation" between
Israeli and US military forces, the Israeli army said.


The exercise included the testing of Israel's Arrow missile
interception system as well as the US-produced Patriot system.


No real missiles were intercepted during the computer
simulations, which took place over several days, but "both sides
were pleased with the results of the exercise," the sources said.


Israel has in recent years been concentrating efforts on
countering the threat of missile attacks from neighbouring Arab
states and Iran, which has conducted several long-range missile
tests in recent years.


Coupled with Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad's calls to wipe
Israel "off the face of the map," the Jewish state -- believed to
be the region's sole nuclear power -- has come to consider Iran's
controversial nuclear plan as an "existential threat."


Israel and the United States accuse Iran of using its civil
atomic energy programme as a cover for developing nuclear
weapons, something Tehran strongly denies.


Israel and the United States conduct bilateral training exercises
"on a regular basis," the army said.
