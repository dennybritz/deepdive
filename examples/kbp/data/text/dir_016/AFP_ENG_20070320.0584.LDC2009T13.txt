Los Angeles Dodgers manager Grady Little had his contract option
picked up by the Major League Baseball club on Tuesday with an
additional option year added for 2009, the team announced.


Little guided the Dodgers to an 88-74 record and a wild-card
playoff berth last year in his first season with the National
League club.


"Last season was the start of some very good things for the
Dodgers and I'm honored to be a part of this team," Little said.
"I look forward to even bigger and better things in the future."


Little, 57, has a 276-210 record in three seasons as a major
league manager and his .568 winning percentage is the best among
all current major league managers.


Only former Baltimore field boss Earl Weaver's .583 mark is
better among all managers with more than 400 major league games
of experience.


Little guided the Boston Red Sox to a 188-136 record over the
2002 and 2003 seasons. His 93 wins in 2002 were the most in 22
years by a rookie manager.


"Grady has shown invaluable leadership and proven that he
understands what it takes to win," Dodgers general manager Ned
Colletti said.
