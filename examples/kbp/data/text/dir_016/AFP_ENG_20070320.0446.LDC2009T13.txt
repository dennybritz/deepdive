Saudi King Abdullah discussed Palestinian developments on Tuesday
with the exiled leader of the Islamist Hamas movement, Khaled
Meshaal, the official SPA news agency reported.


It said the monarch and Meshaal, who arrived in Riyadh earlier in
the day, "discussed developments pertaining to the Palestinian
issue."


Last month, Saudi Arabia brokered a deal between Hamas and the
secular Fatah party of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas that
led to the formation of a unity government that took office on
Saturday.


Palestinians hope that the cabinet will lead to a lifting of a
Western aid boycott that has devastated their already crippled
economy.


The blockade was imposed after Hamas won an overwhelming and
surprise victory over the long-dominant Fatah in elections early
last year.


Israel, its major ally the United States, and the European Union
continue to refuse to deal with Hamas unless it recognises Israel
and renounces violence. The Islamist movement insists on the
right of resistance against Israeli occupation of Palestinian
lands.


The Saudi cabinet on Monday called on world powers to recognise
the new Palestinian government and lift the boycott.


Riyadh has been engaged in a flurry of diplomatic contacts ahead
of the annual Arab summit it will host on March 28-29.
