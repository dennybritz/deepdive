UN nuclear inspectors visited the Iranian nuclear facility in
Natanz on Tuesday, diplomats said, but it was not clear if they
resolved a dispute over monitoring a strategic underground
bunker.


"The inspectors were able to carry out their inspection work in
Iran on Tuesday," said a diplomat close to the UN watchdog
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who asked not to be
named due to the sensitivity of the issue.


A second diplomat said the IAEA experts visited the underground
bunker where Iran is building an industrial-scale plant to make
enriched uranium, which can be either nuclear reactor fuel or
atom bomb material.


Iran had stopped IAEA inspectors from visiting Natanz last
Saturday, in a move a third diplomat said was designed to hide
work they have done underground in installing centrifuges, the
machines which spin at supersonic speeds to enrich urnaium.


Iran has refused to let the IAEA install cameras to monitor the
hall where Iran has already set up hundreds of centrigures, deep
underground as protection against air attack.


But Iran had promised "frequent inspector access" to the site,
the IAEA reported in February.
