James Plant, the chief executive of Cyberkey Solutions, was
charged by US officials Tuesday with falsely claiming his firm
had won a lucrative deal with the Department of Homeland
Security.


The Securities and Exchange Commission, America's top securities
watchdog, said it had filed civil charges against Plant and
Cyberkey, a Utah-based technology firm, over claims Cyberkey had
won a 24 million dollar contract from the DHS.


"Cyberkey had no business relationship at all with DHS," the SEC
said.


Plant, who was arrested by FBI agents last week, and Cyberkey
pocketed at least 1.5 million dollars through selling company
shares while spreading phony claims that the DHS was going to buy
flash memory drives from the firm.


"The perpetrators of this scheme carried out an extensive fraud,"
said SEC enforcement director Linda Thomsen.


The DHS is charged with protecting the United States from terror
attacks.
