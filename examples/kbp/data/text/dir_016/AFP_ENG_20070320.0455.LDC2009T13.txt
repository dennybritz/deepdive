South African fast bowler Andrew Hall said he was adjusting to
local conditions as he put in an impressive bowling spell against
Scotland in their World Cup Group A match here Tuesday.


Hall claimed 3-48 off his 10 overs, including two maidens,
against a dogged Scottish side that came to life only at the end
of the innings.


With Scotland tailender Paul Hoffmann accelerating the painfully
slow runrate, including hitting Charl Langeveldt for an
outrageous six over deep point and two fours in the penultimate
over, Hall knew which line to take.


"He was stepping away and hitting out so I had to bowl inside the
wide line," said Hall, a useful bits-and-pieces cricketer who has
hit three half-centuries in 77 one-day internationals.


"You always try not to be too predictable.


"It's one of the rules of (playing in) the sub-continent and West
Indies," said Hall, who was shot at point-blank range during a
robbery and lived to tell the tale.


South Africa are chasing 187 runs for victory at Warner Park and
a place in the Super Eight phase of the tournament.
