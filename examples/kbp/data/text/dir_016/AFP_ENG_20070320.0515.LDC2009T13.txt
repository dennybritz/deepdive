Belgium on Tuesday admitted that a visa was issued in error to a
close aide of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, despite being
on a European Union black list and banned from travelling in the
bloc.


The Belgian consulate in the South African city of Johannesburg
issued the visa, which gives access to most of the EU countries,
to Edward Chindori-Chininga, a member of Mugabe's Zanu-PF party
"on the basis of a passport with an incomplete name," Belgium's
foreign ministry said.


"If the name had been complete, Belgium would not have issued the
visa since this person is on a black list," a ministry spokesman
said.


He added that once the ministry became aware of the error, it
took steps to ensure that the Zimbabwean official did not enter
Belgian territory, though he did not say whether he had arrived
in Europe.


The EU is concerned about the deteriorating political situation
in Zimbabwe where Mugabe has stepped up a crackdown on the
opposition.


Mugabe and his entourage are banned from travelling to Europe
under sanctions imposed by the EU on Zimbabwe since 2002 for
human rights violations.


Chindori-Chininga had wanted to take part in a meeting at the
European Parliament building in Brussels.


EU rules allow people who are on black lists to obtain
"restricted" visas to respond to invitations from international
organisations, a spokesman for the European Commission said.
