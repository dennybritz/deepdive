US President George W. Bush will make a statement Tuesday on a
scandal over the firing of federal prosecutors, the White House
said.


The president will make the statement at 5:45 pm (2145 GMT), the
White House said.


The event comes as Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is under
mounting pressure to resign. Recently published official
documents Bush implicate White House intervention in the
extraordinary firing last year of eight US attorneys for reasons
which the attorneys have claimed were wholly political.


But Bush's statement will not be an announcement of Gonzales's
resignation, said a senior administration official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.


"No announcement, this isn't about an announcement on the AG,"
the official said. "You can expect that he will probably offer
words of support for the attorney general."


The official said the focus of Bush's statement would be to
highlight his position on an offer of cooperation made to
Congress. The White House would allow Bush administration
officials to be interviewed by congressional committees, but has
refused to allow them to give sworn testimony.
