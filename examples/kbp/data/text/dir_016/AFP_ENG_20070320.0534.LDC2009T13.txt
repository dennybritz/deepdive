The White House on Tuesday rejected calls for top aides including
political guru Karl Rove to testify in a mushrooming controversy
over a mass firing of federal prosecutors.


US President George W. Bush's official government lawyer, Fred
Fielding, told leading lawmakers in a letter released by the
White House that current and former administration officials
would accept private interviews instead.


"Such interviews would be private and conducted without the need
for an oath, transcript, subsequent testimony, or the subsequent
issuance of subpoenas," Fielding said.


Fielding indicated that his offer covered his predecessor,
Harriet Miers; Rove; and other officials tied to the December
2006 purge, which critics charge was politically motivated.


The judiciary committees of the Senate and House of
Representatives, run by Bush's Democratic foes since January, had
been in discussions with Fielding in an attempt to question such
current and former top aides.
