Sevilla beat Real Betis 1-0 on Tuesday night to qualify for the
semi-finals of the Spanish Cup after playing the final 33 minutes
of a match interrupted last month because of crowd violence.


Sevilla coach Juande Ramos was knocked unconscious by a bottle
thrown from the crowd during the quarter-final tie on February 28
after Sevilla had gone into the lead with a 57th-minute goal by
Frederic Kanoute.


The completion of this match was ordered to be played behind
closed doors at first division side Getafe, who are based in the
Madrid suburbs. Real Betis were also handed a three-match stadium
ban by the Spanish football federation.


Sevilla join Barcelona, Deportivo La Coruna and Getafe in the
last four.
