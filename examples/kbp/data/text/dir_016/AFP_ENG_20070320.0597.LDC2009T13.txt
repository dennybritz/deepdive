French President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday threatened Sudan with
sanctions if the "crimes against humanity" in the war-torn region
of Darfur continued.


"I say solemnly: if the attacks continue, if agreements are not
respected, the (United Nations) Security Council will have no
other choice but to adopt sanctions. We are already working on
it," he said in a message read out during a meeting organised by
French group Urgence Darfur in Paris.


"And everything must be done to ensure the UN and African Union
forces can be deployed to Darfur," he added in the message made
public by his office.


Fighting between rebels and armed pro-government groups in Darfur
has killed 200,000 people and displaced more than two million in
the last four years, according to the UN.


In August, a UN security council resolution called for the
gradual deployment of a joint UN-AU force of 20,000 to the
region, to bolster the under-equipped AU force deployed in 2004.


Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir rejected the resolution but in
November agreed to a compromise plan for a hybrid AU-UN
peacekeeping operation -- an agreement he has now backed away
from.


Both Britain and Washington have threatened new sanctions against
the Khartoum government if it does not support the troop
deployment, and on Monday UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also
urged Beshir to accept it.
