The United Nations Children's Fund has helped launch a survey in
Nigeria aimed at monitoring the well-being of women and children,
officials said Tuesday.


UNICEF, along with Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),
began on March 14 to collect data for the third Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 3), the UN agency said in a
statement.


The first and second MICS, developed by UNICEF to assist
countries in tracking the conditions of women and children, were
carried out in Nigeria in 1995 and 1999 respectively.


The current survey will be conducted throughout all 36 of
Nigeria's states, including in hard-to-reach areas, and a total
of 41,600 households will be visited by more than 400 surveyors,
the UNICEF statement said.


MICS 3 aims to compile a wide range of data including on
nutrition, education, child and maternal health, HIV-AIDS,
immunisation, access to safe drinking water, sanitation, child
labour, and birth registration.


UNICEF, with 1.5 million dollars, has paid for most of the
project, but the British government has also committed a quarter
of a million dollars in funding.


Final results are due in August.
