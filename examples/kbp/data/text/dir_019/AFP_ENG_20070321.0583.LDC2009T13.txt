The Democratic Republic of Congo's embargo on trading raw
minerals with neighbouring Zambia will not be lifted until
illegal exports and fraud are stamped out, DRC officials said
Wednesday.


Dozens of lorries have been blocked in the border town of
Kasumbalesa since its governor, Moses Katumbi, announced last
week's ban.


Mining experts claim that up to 90 percent of the exports of
heterogenite -- a compound of cobalt and copper traded in its raw
form before being refined in South Africa and Zambia -- elude DRC
custom controls.


DRC mining minister Martin Kabwelulu Labilo said the ban was
imposed because of the poor monitoring of exports and checking of
declarations of transport tonnages.


Hours before Wednesday's announcement, around 100 vehicles were
seized in mineral-rich Katanga province which were suspected of
not declaring proper tonnages to customs, according to local
press.


"We are conscious of the annoyance caused to some partners, but
they must understand that we have to combat fraud and illegal
exports," Alexis Mikandji, chief advisor to the mining ministry,
told AFP.


Mikandji said the government wanted to encourage and develop ways
to treat heterogenite and introduce greater regulation.


He added that trade in other materials would remain open between
the countries as normal.
