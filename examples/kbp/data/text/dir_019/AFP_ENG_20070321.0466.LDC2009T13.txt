Guyana on Wednesday turned back a ship carrying 900 tonnes of
soya believed to be contaminated with salmonella and ordered the
vessel to return to France, the agriculture ministry said.


French authorities also want the cargo, being transported aboard
a Bahamian- registered vessel, to return to France so it can be
destroyed, Guyana's agriculture ministry said in a statement.


"Based on additional information supplied by French
authorities... the Ministry of Agriculture's quarantine
department has decided it would not allow the offloading" of the
shipment, it said.


The cargo was earlier refused by authorities in Guadeloupe. The
ship headed for Guyana after a privately-owned poultry company
offered to buy the contents to make feed, Agriculture Minister
Robert Persaud told AFP.


However, the government warned that all agricultural supplies
must meet international sanitary and safety requirements before
entering the South American country.
