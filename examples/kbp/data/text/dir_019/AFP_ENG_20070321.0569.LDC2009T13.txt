Slovenia's Petra Majdic won the 1.1km sprint classic here on
Wednesday as the World Cup sprint season drew to a close.


World championship silver medallist Majdic beat Finland's Virpi
Kuitunen into second with Sweden's Anna Dahlberg third.


Three-time world champion Kuitunen had already ensured she would
finish the season on top of the pile in the sprint section, the
longer distances and the overall World Cup standings.


The last World Cup race of the season will take place in Falun,
Sweden on Saturday.
