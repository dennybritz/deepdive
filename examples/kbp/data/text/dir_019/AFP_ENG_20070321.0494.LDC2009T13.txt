Birmingham boosted their attack on Wednesday in their final push
for promotion back to the Premiership by signing former England
international striker Andy Cole on loan from Premiership side
Portsmouth for the rest of the campaign.


The 35-year-old will be reunited with his former Manchester
United team-mate and now Birmingham manager Steve Bruce.


Cole has found a regular starting spot with Pompey hard to come
by since joining last August for 500,000 pounds from Manchester
City - though he has scored four times in the five matches he has
played for them.


Bruce, who has guided Birmingham into the second and last
automatic promotion spot after a difficult start to their season,
said he had felt the team needed an experienced striker up front.


"Andy can help us get across the finishing line in what is a very
tight promotion battle," said Bruce, who played with Cole at
United from January 1995 until May 1996.


"I played with him at United - although it was a long time ago -
and he is a top, top professional who looks after himself. That's
why he is still a Premiership player.


"We have very young players at the top end of the pitch, people
like Cameron Jerome, DJ Campbell and Nicklas Bendtner although
they all have great potential.


"I just feel we need that extra bit of experience and quality up
front."


Birmingham trail leaders Derby County by two points, but only
have a one point advantage over third-placed Sunderland - though
Bruce's side have eight games remaining to the other two's seven.
