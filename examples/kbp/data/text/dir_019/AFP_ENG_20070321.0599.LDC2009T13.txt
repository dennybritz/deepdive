The US and South Korean governments will head into a last round
of talks next week in a race against time to forge an ambitious
free-trade agreement (FTA), the chief US negotiator said
Wednesday.


After wrapping up three days of informal talks at a Washington
hotel, US trade official Wendy Cutler said the two sides were
"closing in" on the most sensitive areas covered by the
prospective FTA, including agriculture and automobiles.


"It will come as no surprise that we have not wrapped up the
negotiations this week," Cutler, the assistant US trade
representative (USTR), told reporters.


But she stressed that next week in Seoul, the two nations shared
the "aim and the determination" to conclude what would be the
biggest FTA since the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement.


The US delegation for the talks with South Korean Trade Minister
Kim Hyun-Jong will be elevated to include Deputy USTR Karan
Bhatia.


The two sides have scant time left to wrap up a deal under the US
political calendar.


The US administration's power to fast-track trade agreements
through Congress expires at the end of June. That gives US
negotiators up to March 31 to present a deal for a mandatory
90-day congressional review.
