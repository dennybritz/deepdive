New terminals were opened at Albania's only airport on Wednesday
following the single biggest investment in the country's air
transport infrastructure since the 1960s, officials said.


The passenger and cargo terminals at the Mother Teresa Rinas
airport near the capital Tirana were built by a German-American
consortium at a cost of about 50 million euros (66.5 million
dollars), said company spokesman Arlinda Causholli.


The passenger terminal is capable of accommodating up to one
million passengers a year, while the cargo terminal can handle
4,500 tonnes a year.


The international airport in Rinas, a suburb of Tirana, will be
run by the Tirana Airport Partners consortium for the next 20
years.


Last year, it registered about 15,850 flights on 15 international
airlines.
