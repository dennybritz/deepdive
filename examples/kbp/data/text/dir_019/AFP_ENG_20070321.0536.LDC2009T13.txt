Three Democratic Republic of Congo police officers were killed
and three civilians were injured in an attack on a vehicle in the
eastern city of Mugogo, authorities said Wednesday.


The assailants have not been identified, a local government
official said.


The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon when a group of armed
suspects attacked a transport vehicle carrying passengers and
goods. A UN-financed local radio station reported that the
attackers included 11 men wearing uniforms.


The attackers stole the police officers' weapons and other
passengers' mobile phones, the government official said.


Near-daily clashes occur between military officers and Rwandan
Hutu rebels in the Rutshuru region, where the attack occurred.
The rebels are allied with a local militia.
