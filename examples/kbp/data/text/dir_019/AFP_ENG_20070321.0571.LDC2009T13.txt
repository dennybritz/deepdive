The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector
arm of the World Bank, announced a 50 million dollars loan to one
of Nigeria's largest banks, an IFC statement said on Wednesday.


The beneficiary of the IFC loan, the United Bank for Africa
(UBA), is Nigeria's largest bank in terms of commercial assets,
IFC said.


"The deal highlights IFC's continued strategic partnership with
select Nigerian financial institutions and is expected to both
deepen confidence in the country's financial sector reforms," it
said.


The 50 million dollars convertible loan is part of a 75 million
dollars financing and advisory services package that IFC's Board
approved for the bank. The package also includes a 25 million
dollars partial credit guarantee for bonds and medium-term notes
that UBA plans to issue to finance mortgage lending and other
strategic businesses.


That portion of the deal is expected to be signed in the near
future, IFC said.


Nigeria became a member and a shareholder of IFC in 1961.  Since
then, IFC has invested more than one billion dollars in the
country, including 113 million dollars in syndicated loans, to
finance over 68 projects across a variety of sectors.


IFC's committed portfolio in Nigeria currently stands at 719
million dollars.


The international lender has invested in key sectors including
banking, infrastructure, general manufacturing, oil and gas,
healthcare, tourism and education in Nigeria, it said.
