Tom Cruise is to star in a World War II thriller about a plot to
assassinate Adolph Hitler, reports said Wednesday.


The 44-year-old "Mission Impossible" star will take a central
role of the untitled film, which will be directed by Bryan Singer
of "The Usual Suspects" and "Superman Returns" fame, reports
said.


Movie industry press said the film would be the second made by
United Artists since Cruise took over the company last year
following his acrimonious split with Paramount.


The movie is based on a real-life plot hatched by German generals
to kill Hitler during World War II.


Cruise, regarded as one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood
with 2.7 billion dollars in receipts, is currently working on
political drama "Lions for Lambs," with Robert Redford and Meryl
Streep.
