The Federal Reserve held its base interest rate steady Wednesday
at 5.25 percent, saying the latest indicators on the economy were
"mixed."


The decision, widely expected by economists and financial
markets, leaves the federal funds rate where it has been since
last June.


"Recent indicators have been mixed and the adjustment in the
housing sector is ongoing," the Federal Open Market Committee
said. "Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to
expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters."


The statement said inflation pressures have been "somewhat
elevated" but "seem likely to moderate over time."


However, the Fed said the "high level of resource utilization has
the potential to sustain those (inflation) pressures."
