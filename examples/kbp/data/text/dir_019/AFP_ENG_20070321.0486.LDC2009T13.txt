Latvians who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II
are to be honoured with a museum, officials in Riga said
Wednesday.


The museum will be named after Zanis Lipke, the Latvian labourer
who rescued 56 Jews during the Nazi occupation of the Baltic
state, and will be set in the Riga suburb of Kipsala, where Lipke
used to live, Riga City Council said in a statement.


"Similar museums have been created in other European cities --
Amsterdam, Berlin, Tallinn. Our difference will be that this
memorial will be about memories of escape, of hope and faith, of
the perseverance of humanity at a time when it was threatened
with total destruction," the statement said.


The museum's mazelike architecture will resemble "a never-ending
journey through passages to symbolic freedom," it added.


Lipke died in 1987. He and his wife were granted the title of the
Righteous Among Nations -- a title conferred by Israel's Yad
Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Authority on non-Jews who saved Jews
from extermination by the Nazis.


Around 85,000 Jews resided in Latvia before World War II, but
many were deported or murdered when the Baltic state was occupied
by Nazi Germany.


Today, Latvia's Jewish community numbers fewer than 10,000 people
in a country of 2.3 million.
