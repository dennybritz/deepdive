A suspect acquitted in the 1985 Air India bombing that killed
hundreds is suing Canada's attorney general, saying the failed
prosecution cost him his fortune and reputation, media said
Wednesday.


Ripudaman Singh Malik and a co-accused were acquitted two years
ago of bombing Air India Flight 182 off the coast of Ireland on
June 23, 1985.


The blast killed 329 passengers and crew members, including 280
Canadians.


Prosecutors blamed radical orthodox Sikh immigrants to Canada,
saying the bombing was payback for the Indian government's 1984
army attack on the Sikhs' Golden Temple at Amritsar.


But the only person jailed over the attack was bomb-maker
Inderjit Singh Reyat, who now faces perjury charges over his
testimony at the trial of Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri.


The alleged mastermind of the plot, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was
killed in a police shootout in India in 1992.


Malik was a wealthy businessman in Canada's westernmost British
Columbia province when he was charged in 2000.


According to court documents, cited by the Globe and Mail, Malik
is claiming unspecified damages "for malicious prosecution,
wrongful imprisonment, breach of (his) Charter rights, conspiracy
to injure, negligent performance of duty and damage to (his)
reputation in connection with the wrongful prosecution."


The attorney general of British Columbia was also named in the
suit, the newspaper said.
