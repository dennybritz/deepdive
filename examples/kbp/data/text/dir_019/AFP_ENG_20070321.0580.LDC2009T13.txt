European Union election observers deployed to Nigeria for April
polls will stay away from the three most volatile states in the
oil-rich Niger Delta, the EU's chief observer said Wednesday.


"We are not able to be in three states -- Rivers, Delta and
Bayelsa -- because there, the environment for international
observers is not really conducive," Max van den Berg told
reporters.


"We don't like it but it is the reality. It is also the decision
taken. For the other 33 states, we will be there," he said.


The EU official said in view of the "whole set of different
events and judgments made by people... it will be irresponsible
on our side as international observers to observe there."


Since last year, the three states have accounted for almost all
the kidnapping of more than 100 foreigners, killings of about 40
security officers and destruction of oil facilities.


The EU mission is due to issue a preliminary statement after each
election and a final report within three months of the completion
of the entire poll, he added.
