The father of Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, whose
controversial lifestyle was a favourite topic for the tabloid
press, died on Wednesday at the age of 70, his son announced.


Sven Hoeiby, a former journalist thrust into the limelight by his
daughter's marriage to heir to the throne Prince Haakon in August
2001, was diagnosed with lung cancer last year.


"On behalf of my family, I would like to announce that Sven
Hoeiby died today, Wednesday March 21," his son Espen told
Norwegian agency NTB.


Hoeiby, who divorced Mette-Marit's mother in the 1980s, caused a
scandal several years ago by marrying Renathe Barsgaard, a former
stripper half his age, for three months.


The Crown Princess had sought to distance herself from her
father, partly to move away from her own past which includes a
wild adolescence and an illegitimate child.
