A top aide of radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has been
released after nearly three years in US military detention, a
media officer at Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's office said on
Wednesday.


"Ahmed Shibani was released at the prime minister's request,"
Haider Majid told AFP.


Sadr's office in Baghdad confirmed Shibani's release.


Sadr is a key political ally of Maliki's embattled Shiite-led
national unity government.


The cleric's political bloc has six ministers in the cabinet and
32 lawmakers in the 275-member Iraqi parliament.


Shibani was a prominent spokesman for the cleric during the
August 2004 rebellion when Sadr's Mahdi Army militia fought US
forces in the central holy city of Najaf.


He was arrested by the US military after the rebellion in which
hundreds of Mahdi Army militants were killed.


The US military considers the Mahdi Army to be the greatest
threat to Iraq's security in the continuing Shiite-Sunni
sectarian conflict gripping the country.
