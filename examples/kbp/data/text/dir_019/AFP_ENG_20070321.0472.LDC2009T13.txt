Russian President Vladimir Putin named a new representative to
the European Court of Human Rights, where his country has come
under increasing scrutiny, his office announced on Wednesday.


Putin named Veronika Milintchouk to replace Pavel Laptev at the
court. No futher details were given.


The court has seen a large number of complaints filed by Russian
citizens recently.


Many of the 9,000 complaints originating from Russia that are
currently before the court -- far more than any other European
country -- involve accusations of kidnappings or assassinations
by Russian forces in Chechnya.


Between 1999 and 2006, court judgments have gone against Russia
in 101 out of 105 cases that often involve murders and
disappearances in Chechnya, the separatist Russian republic.


Putin and others in Russia have criticised the court, with the
Russian president condemning the "politicisation of cases."


The Russian lower house of Parliament in December rejected a
measure aimed at increasing the court's efficiency thereby
blocking its adoption. All other Council of Europe members have
ratified the measure.


The court is based in Strasbourg, France.
