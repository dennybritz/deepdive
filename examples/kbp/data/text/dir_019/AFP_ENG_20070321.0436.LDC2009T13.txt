Five Pakistani paramilitary soldiers were killed and two others
were injured Wednesday when armed men attacked them near the
border with Afghanistan, officials said.


The soldiers at Bramcha post in southwestern Baluchistan province
near the frontier with Afghanistan's Helmand province were
attacked around 5.30pm local time, they said.


"Five soldiers have embraced martyrdom and two others were
injured," a paramilitary commander told AFP.


It was not immediately clear whether those responsible were
Taliban-linked militants, drug smugglers or other Afghan groups,
the commander said on condition of anonymity.
