European foreign ministers will hold an informal two-day EU
meeting next week to discuss Kosovo, Iran and the Middle East,
Germany said Wednesday.


The meeting in Bremen, northern Germany, will start on March 30
with talks on the future status of Kosovo, the Serbian province
whose Albanian majority is demanding independence.


The ministers will devote a working session to the Middle East
peace process the following day, with the EU expected to expand
its wait-and-see position on dealing with the new Palestinian
unity government.


Germany, which currently holds the EU presidency, said foreign
ministers from aspiring EU members Turkey, Croatia and Macedonia
had been invited to a discussion on relations with Iran.
