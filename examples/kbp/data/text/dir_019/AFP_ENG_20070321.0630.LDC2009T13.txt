Britain hit out Wednesday at the exchange of Taliban fighters for
an Italian journalist kidnapped in Afghanistan, saying it sent
the wrong message to the hostage takers.


The Afghan government admitted to exchanging five Taliban
prisoners for the Italian Daniele Mastrogiacomo on Tuesday,
saying it was "an exceptional measure" and would not be repeated.


"The UK has serious concerns about the implications of releasing
Taliban in return for hostages," the foreign ministry spokeswoman
told AFP. "This sends the wrong signal to prospective hostage
takers."


Mastrogiacomo was captured in the southern province of Helmand on
March 4 with a translator and a driver. The journalist said the
driver was beheaded in front of him. The translator was still
being held, an official said.


Britain has 6,300 troops in Afghanistan as part of the
International Security Assistance Force, most of whom are in the
Helmand province, with 1,400 more due to join them.
