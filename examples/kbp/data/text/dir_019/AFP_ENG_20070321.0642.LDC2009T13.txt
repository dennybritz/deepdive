Sacramento Kings star forward Ron Artest faces four charges,
including battery and corporal injury to a spouse, in connection
with allegations of domestic abuse.


Artest will also be arraigned on misdemeanor charges of false
imprisonment and dissuading a witness from reporting a crime, the
Sacramento Bee reported on Wednesday.


"There are four misdemeanor counts - inflicting corporal injury
on a spouse, battery on a spouse, false imprisonment and
preventing or dissuading a victim or witness from reporting a
crime," Deputy District Attorney Dan Quick told the Bee.


"I can't discuss the facts of the case - it wouldn't be ethical,"
he said. "We reviewed the facts of the case and all the pertinent
information, as we do all domestic violence cases. Based on our
review, this is what we believe are the appropriate charges."


Artest's wife called emergency services on March 5 to report an
incident with Artest at their Sacramento area home. Artest was
arrested at the home and the charges were filed on Tuesday.


The misdemeanor counts carry a maximum sentence of 12 years
although rarely is the maximum sentence handed out in this type
of crime, experts said.
