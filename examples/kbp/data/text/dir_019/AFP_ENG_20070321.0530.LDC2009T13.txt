German pensioners will this year get their first state pension
increase in three years, Labour and Social Affairs Minister Franz
Muentefering announced on Wednesday.


"There will this year be a 0.54 percent increase in pensions,"
Muentefering told ARD public television.


He said the increase would cost the state 1.2 billion euros (1.6
billion dollars) per year.


Muentefering declined to say whether pensioners could expect
further increases in 2008.


Pensioners have had to tighten their belts in recent years
because of the rising cost of providing state pensions at a time
when the number of people working is declining.


The German parliament voted this month to gradually raise the
country's official retirement age from 65 to 67 years between
2012 and 2029.
