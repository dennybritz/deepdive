Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said Wednesday he would
take over as foreign minister, just days after President Traian
Basescu rejected his candidate for the post.


"I have decided to take on, on an interim basis, the duties of
foreign minister until the blockage has been solved," Tariceanu
told a press conference.


He insisted: "We need a foreign minister who represents and
promotes Romania's interests."


Basescu rejected Tariceanu's nomination of historian and liberal
European MP Adrian Cioroianu for the post of foreign minister
last week.


Basescu told his prime minister that Cioroianu was "not a good
solution" and asked him "to find a more experienced diplomat" but
Tariceanu said he had no intention of making another
recommendation.


Cioroianu's nomination came two weeks after Foreign Minister
Razvan Ungureanu was forced to resign from his post, following
the prime minister's claims that he had failed to inform him of
the detention by US forces in Iraq of two Romanian workers.
