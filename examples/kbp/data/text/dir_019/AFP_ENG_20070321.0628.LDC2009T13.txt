A young British army medic became the first woman to be awarded
the Military Cross on Wednesday after enduring enemy fire in Iraq
to save an injured colleague.


Private Michelle Norris, 19, of the Royal Army Medical Corps was
presented with the medal by Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony in
Buckingham Palace.


The Military Cross is a level-three award -- the Victoria Cross
is the highest honour -- presented for gallantry during ground
combat.


Norris, deployed as a medic with The Queen's Royal Hussars Battle
Group, was a member of a patrol supporting Iraqi security forces
in Al-Amarah, Maysan province, in June last year when the group
came under attack.


Her commander was shot in the face and wounded, at which point
Norris braved fire from more than a hundred insurgents to climb
to the top of an armoured vehicle to give him life-saving aid.


"I jumped out of the Warrior and climbed up," Norris said after
the presentation ceremony. "I didn't realise at the time I was
being shot at."
