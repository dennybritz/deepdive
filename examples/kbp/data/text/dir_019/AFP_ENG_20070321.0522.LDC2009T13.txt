Russia inaugurated on Wednesday a new school aimed at tempting
the country's elite away from the lucrative private business
world and into the civil service.


The new School of Public Administration, which is the first of
its kind in Russia, will "serve the state," and its graduates
"will define the level of public administration," Moscow
University principal Victor Sadovnichii said at the inauguration
ceremony.


Modeled on France's Ecole Nationale d'Administration, or ENA,
where many of France's senior officials are educated, the new
institution will be part of Moscow University.


The idea for the new Russian school is to "create managers at the
highest level who will also be experts in public affairs," French
ENA director Antoine Durrleman said at the ceremony.


"There is not, on one side, companies that will need excellent
professionals and on the other side the administration. To be
efficient, the administration will need these professionals," he
said.


Russia's public sector has long struggled to attract the
country's best minds, since it can only offer very modest
salaries compared to what young graduates find in large Russian
companies, buoyed by an ongoing economic boom.
