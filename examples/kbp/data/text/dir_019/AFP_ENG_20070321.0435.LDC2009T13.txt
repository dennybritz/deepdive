England and Liverpool football star Steven Gerrard added an
honour from Queen Elizabeth II to his collection of sporting
medals on Wednesday when he picked up an award at Buckingham
Palace in London.


The 26-year-old was made an MBE (Member of the Order of the
British Empire) - and said meeting the queen was a more important
event than the biggest cup final match.


"I've played in special games with special people but I've never
experienced anything like this," he said.


"It's completely different nerves to football. In football, I
know what I'm going to do but today is a big day and a proud day
for me."


The Liverpool captain, who has won two English FA Cups and a
Champions League winners' medal, added: "I've achieved a lot but
I'm still only 26 and it's early in my career. I'm hungry for
more."


Gerrard, who is also England's vice-captain, was joined at the
palace by his girlfriend Alex Curran.
