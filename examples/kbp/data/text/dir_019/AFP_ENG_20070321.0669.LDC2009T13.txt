The coalition forces that invaded Iraq in March 2003 made a
"mistake" in not handing power to Iraqis quickly enough, former
US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said in an
interview on Wednesday.


"The real problem was in not relying more on Iraqis," Bolton told
the BBC.


"By imposing the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) for a
year, we denied the Iraqis at least a year of learning how to
live with each other ... So in 20/20 hindsight, and I confess
it's hindsight, that was a mistake, obviously ...


The CPA was established by the United States about two months
after the March 2003 invasion, and was only dissolved in June
2004 in the run-up to national elections in Iraq.


"It's perfectly obvious given the circumstances that we should
have handled it differently, and what I would have done
differently is much earlier, much sooner after the overthrow,
given it back to the Iraqis," he said.


Bolton, who was also formerly undersecretary of state for arms
control and international security, was a staunch backer of the
war in Iraq.
