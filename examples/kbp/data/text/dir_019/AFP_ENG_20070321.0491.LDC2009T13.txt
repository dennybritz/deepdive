Kyrgyzstan has asked the United States to extradite a US soldier
accused of murdering a truck driver working for an American
military base in the country, the foreign ministry said
Wednesday.


Kyrgyz prosecutors had already announced on Monday that the US
soldier, Zachary Hatfield, should be tried for murder over the
incident last December.


The US military says Hatfield acted in self-defense, firing two
bullets into the man's chest after the victim -- a Kyrgyz
national -- had threatened him with a knife.


The Kyrgyz foreign ministry has also asked the US military not to
allow Hatfield to leave the country while investigations
continue.


The US base is located on the grounds of the former Soviet
republic's Manas airport and is used to support troops assigned
to Afghanistan.
