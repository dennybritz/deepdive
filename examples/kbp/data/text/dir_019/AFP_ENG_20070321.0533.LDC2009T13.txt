Swedish police on Wednesday said they had lifted a security
threat against a nuclear power plant after investigating an
anonymous bomb threat at the facility, the TT news agency said.


A bomb squad with dogs had rushed to the scene and roadblocks
were set up around the Forsmark plant, located about 100
kilometers (60 miles) north of Stockholm on the country's east
coast, police said.


The security threat was lifted in the afternoon, TT said.


"Our assessment is that there is no immediate danger surrounding
the threat," Uppsala police spokesman Christer Nordstroem had
told AFP earlier.


Neither police nor Andersson would provide information on the
nature of the threat.


But Nordstroem said police had "not found anything that could be
a bomb".


The Forsmark facility, one of Sweden's three nuclear power
plants, has been hit by a series of safety incidents and
shutdowns in recent months, prompting calls for a rethink of the
plant's safety culture.
