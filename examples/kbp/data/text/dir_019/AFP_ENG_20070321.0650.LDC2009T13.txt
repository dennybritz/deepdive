Edinburgh Gunners strengthened their line-up for next season on
Wednesday by signing experienced New Zealand scrum-half Ben
Meyer.


The 29-year-old - who played for the Auckland Blues in the 2000
Super 12 championship - will be reunited with Gunners coach Lynn
Howells, under whom he played for Italian outfit Leonessa in
2003.


Meyer is presently captain of National Provincial Championship
Division One side Counties Manukau, and has also played for North
Harbour and Northland.


Howells was delighted to have secured Meyer's agreement to come
and play for him again.


"As well as being a quality player, he is a very good organiser
and communicator," said Howells.


"We were looking for an experienced scrum-half and he fits the
bill.


"He was highly regarded when he played in Italy as someone who
could lead a team on the pitch.


"His adherence to strict fitness regimes will also hopefully take
the squad to a new level."


Edinburgh had a desperate European Cup campaign, finishing bottom
of their group with just one win from six matches.
