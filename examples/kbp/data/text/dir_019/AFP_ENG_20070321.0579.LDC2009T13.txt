Spain on Wednesday said it had significant doubts about the
United States' plan to install an anti-missile defence system in
central Europe.


"The project raises for us significant doubts which must be
examined carefully," Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said
during a parliamentary question- and-answer question.


He doubted the ability of the proposed system, which would be
based in Poland and the Czech Republic, to prevent the
proliferation of weapons.


Moratinos also raised questions about the repercussions it could
have on relations between the West and Russia, which has strongly
opposed the project, and the countries "where it will be pointed
at in the south" -- namely Iran.


However, he admitted that the Spanish government did not have
enough information on the project and said it had set up a
committee to look into it.


The proposed anti-missile defence system is intended to complete
existing systems in the United States, Greeland and the United
Kingdom.


Washington has insisted it is not aimed at Russia but intended to
defend against potential threats from Iran and North Korea.
