Two British sailors were killed and a third injured in an
accident Wednesday on board a nuclear submarine in the Arctic
Ocean, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in London said.


Early indications were that the accident on board HMS Tireless
involved a piece of air purification equipment to the bow (front)
of the submarine, but the vessel was "never in any danger", the
MoD said.
