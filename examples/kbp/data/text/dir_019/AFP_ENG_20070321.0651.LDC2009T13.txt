Croatia issued on Wednesday an international arrest warrant for a
former senior Yugoslav military official wanted here for crimes
against civilians during the 1991-1995 war.


Justice Minister Ana Lovrin approved issuing of the warrant for
former Yugoslav defence minister Veljko Kadijevic, a police
official Dubravko Novak told national radio.


The warrant was issued following a request made earlier this
month by a court in the eastern town of Vukovar.


It was prompted notably by local media reports according to which
Kadijevic was living since 2003 in Florida, the United States.
Kadijevic, 82, allegedly became an advisor to the military
coalition in Iraq.


In 2003 the Vukovar court charged Kadijevic along with nine other
former Yugoslav officials for war crimes committed during the
siege of the eastern town in 1991.


During a brutal three-month siege of Vukovar by the former
Yugoslav army (JNA) and rebel Serb forces more than 1,100
civilians were killed and the town was virtually razed to the
ground.


Croatia's judicial authorities also charged Kadijevic in 1992 and
2006 for war crimes in the region of the central town of Bjelovar
and the eastern town of Osijek respectively.


Croatia's proclamation of independence from the former Yugoslavia
sparked the four-year war with Serb rebels who opposed the move.


During the war, that claimed some 20,000 lives, enjoyed political
and military support from Belgrade.
