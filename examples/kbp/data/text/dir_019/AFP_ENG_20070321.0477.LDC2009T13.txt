UN emergency relief coordinator John Holmes arrived in Khartoum
on Wednesday for a week-long visit, his first since taking up the
post on March 1, Sudanese officials said.


The British diplomat, who succeeded Jan Egeland of Norway, is
expected to meet senior government officials before going to Juba
in southern Sudan, said Sirajeddine Hamed, who heads the peace
and humanitarian affairs department at the foreign ministry.


Holmes then plans to travel the strife-torn western Sudanese
region of Darfur, where a four-year civil war has killed more
than 200,000 people according to UN figures, although some
sources say the toll is much higher.


In a report published this month, the United Nations Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that on
January 1 2007, the number of people internally displaced by the
conflict had topped two million.


The United Nations and non-government organisations have
systematically complained of difficult working conditions in
Darfur, blaming both Sudanese government troops and rebel groups
for the violence.
