Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan pulled out of the ATP Miami
Masters Series on Wednesday suffering from a right wrist injury.


The Thai was trailing Peru's Luis Horna 5-2 in the first set of
their first round clash when he succumbed to the long-standing
problem.


Horna will play France's Gilles Simon in the second round.
