The Bank of China has refused to accept the transfer of frozen
North Korean funds, an issue which has held-up nuclear
disarmament talks with the Stalinist nation, official media
reported Thursday.


The bank was refusing to accept the transfer of the funds from a
Macau bank account, China's Xinhua news agency said, quoting the
chief Russian envoy to the talks, Alexander Losyukov.


Top negotiators to the disarmament talks expressed frustration
Wednesday as North Korea refused to attend a series of six-nation
meetings here as it awaited the promised return of the frozen 25
million dollars.


The latest round of the talks began Monday with the United States
announcing it had resolved the long-running financial sanctions
dispute with North Korea that had been the major stumbling block
in the forum.


Washington had frozen the Macau bank account amid allegations of
money laundering and counterfeiting by the North Korean regime.


Macau authorities said the money would be transferred into a
North Korean account, but by Wednesday the funds had yet to be
delivered.


The Xinhua report did not provide details on why the Bank of
China was refusing the transfer.


The six-nation talks involve the two Koreas, Russia, the United
States, Japan and host China.
