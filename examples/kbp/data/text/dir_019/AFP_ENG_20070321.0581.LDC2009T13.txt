EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner agreed
to meet the new Palestinian finance minister, her spokeswoman
said on Wednesday, in another sign of a thaw in EU-Palestinian
ties.


The visit of minister Salam Fayyad, were it to go ahead, would be
another signal that the European Union is ready to meet members
of the Palestinian unity government, formed last weekend, not
from the militant group Hamas.


Ferrero-Waldner "called Mr Fayyad to congratulate him on his
nomination. He offered to come to Brussels for discussions with
the Commission and she accepted to meet him at an unspecified
date," the spokeswoman said.


The government, a mix of Western-backed moderates and militants,
wants an international embargo against it lifted, amid dire
economic hardship and heavy violence in the Palestinian
territories.


But the spokeswoman said the EU -- the biggest donor to the
Palestinians -- does not plan to resume direct payments to the
government for some time, even though it will continue to funnel
in aid by other means.


The EU's Middle East envoy Marc Otte has already held talks with
Fayyad in the region.
