A valuable woodcut by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, which was
stolen from an estate in southern Sweden last year, has been
returned to its owners, a Swedish daily said Wednesday.


The woodcut, titled "Towards the Forest," was made by Munch in
1897 and is estimated to be worth four million kronor (430,150
euros, 576,300 dollars). It shows two people, one in black and
the other in white, against a green background.


"The insurance company says they received the piece from an
anonymous person," police spokesman Per Goeransson told the
website of the Kvaellsposten daily.


The paper reported that a ransom appeared to have been paid for
the work by the Norwegian master, and that it had been returned
to the sons of the owner, who died soon after it was stolen last
May.
