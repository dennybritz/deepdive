Daisuke Matsuzaka turned in the kind of performance on Wednesday
that the Boston Red Sox had in mind when they anted up more than
100 million dollars for the star Japanese pitcher.


The Japanese righthander allowed just one hit and struck out
seven in 5 2/3 innings as the Red Sox defeated the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 7-3, in a Spring Training exhibition game.


Matsuzaka threw 92 pitches, 61 for strikes, and retired 15 of the
last 16 batters he faced after Adam LaRoche's RBI single in the
first inning.


Matsuzaka has a 2.84 ERA in spring training with 13 strikeouts in
12 2/3 innings.


The 26-year-old Japanese righthander signed a six-year contract
with the Red Sox for 52 million dollars after the Red Sox had
already paid a posting fee of 51.1 million dollars just for the
right to negotiate with the righthander.


The posting fee was far and away the highest ever for an Asian
player. The previous largest bid was the 13.1 million dollars the
Seattle Mariners paid the Orix BlueWave six years ago for the
right to sign Ichiro Suzuki.


Matsuzaka's fellow Japanese import Hideki Okajima pitched a
perfect ninth inning, striking out one.


J.D. Drew drove in three runs and raised his spring training
batting average to .464 with two hits and rookie second baseman
Dustin Pedroia scored three runs for Boston.


Drew signed a five-year, 70 million-dollar deal with the Red Sox
after opting out his contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.


Catcher Ronny Paulino homered off Red Sox reliver Manny Delcarmen
and Andrew McCutchen doubled in a run for the Pirates.
