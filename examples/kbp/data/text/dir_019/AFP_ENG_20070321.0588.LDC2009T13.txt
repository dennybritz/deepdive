World number 11 David Nalbandian will make his return to the
Argentine Davis Cup team for the second round World Group clash
with Sweden from April 6-8 in Gothenburg, the Argentine Tennis
Federation said on Wednesday.


Nalbandian was injured in the previous round against Austria but
teams up with Guillermo Canas (ranked 55), Juan Martin del Potro
(63) and Sebastian Pietro (unranked) in the team.


Despite Nalbandian's absence Argentina still beat Austria 4-1.


Canas has been in fine form recently, inflicting the first defeat
on undisputed world number one Roger Federer of Switzerland in 42
matches during the second round in Indian Wells two weeks ago.
