Democrats in the US House of Representatives engaged in last-
minute haggling Wednesday on the eve of an expected debate over a
controversial 124 billion dollar budget supplemental to fund the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.


Top Democrats want to link approval of the money to a withdrawal
of US forces from Iraq by August 31, 2008. However the party's
leftist base wants the legislators to approve the funding only on
condition that the troops begin to withdraw this year.


It seems unlikely that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will get
members to vote on the request this week as first expected.


The leftist "Out of Iraq" caucus includes dozens of House members
-- and Democrats are under no illusion they will convince
Republicans loyal to President George W. Bush to vote with them
on this issue.


At midday Democratic majority leader Steny Hoyer said he was
hopeful a majority favoring the measure could be reached.


"We're getting closer," he said.


Hours later a source close to the Democratic leadership described
the situation as "optimistic and making gains."


Republicans, most loyal to the White House despite growing doubts
over the unpopular war, sought to emphasize splits among the
majority party.


"We see a leadership that's unable to lead," said Republican Eric
Cantor. "Their caucus is extremely divided."


Calls for a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq remain in the text
of the House measure, even though it will not likely become law
as Bush has repeatedly said he will veto the measure.
