Japan's Tomonobu Shimizu will challenge World Boxing Council
flyweight champion Pongsaklek Wonjongkam of Thailand next month,
his handlers said on Wednesday.


The 25-year-old challenger, ranked 14th in the WBC, has 10 wins,
including four knock outs, against one defeat.


The bout will take place in the central Thai city of Saraburi on
April 6.


Although the Thai champion has defended the title 16 times in a
row, Shimizu was relishing the challenge, saying he likes
fighting left-handers.


"I have an impression that the champion does not like his
opponent to use nimble footwork, and I like a left-hander. I have
no fear," said Shimizu.
