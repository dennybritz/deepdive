Israel's parliament on Wednesday approved a round of changes in
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government, including the
appointment of the first Arab minister.


Under the reshuffle, Labour's Isaac Herzog was named welfare
minister and Ghaleb Majadle, also from the centre-left Labour
party, was appointed as culture minister and the country's first
minister from the Arab minority.


The parliament, or Knesset, also okayed the naming of Yitzhak
Aharonovitz of the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party as
tourism minister, replacing Herzog.


The round of new appointments was sparked by the resignation of
close Olmert ally Haim Ramon from the justice ministry after he
was found guilty in January of sexual harassment.
