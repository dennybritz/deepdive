World No. 3 Andy Roddick and No. 8 James Blake will play singles
for the United States in their Davis Cup quarter-final against
Spain, the US Tennis Association announced Wednesday.


US captain Patrick McEnroe will also have the services of the
top-ranked doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan when the Americans
host Spain at Winston-Salem, North Carolina, April 6-8.


"There's no surprises with our lineup," McEnroe said. "We'll have
the same team for six straight ties, and the guys have a great
team mentality towards Davis Cup.


"Spain will be a strong test for us, but we know there will be a
sold-out, enthusiastic crowd on our side."


It will be a rematch of the 2004 Davis Cup final when the
Spaniards beat the Americans - on clay at Seville.


This time, the countries will meet on an indoor hard court at
Joel Coliseum.


The winner meets the winner of the quarterfinal between Argentina
and Sweden.


The United States have won a record 31 Davis Cups but are looking
to end a 12-year drought.


The last title came in 1995, when Pete Sampras and Jim Courier
spearheaded a 3-2 victory over Russia on clay in Moscow.
