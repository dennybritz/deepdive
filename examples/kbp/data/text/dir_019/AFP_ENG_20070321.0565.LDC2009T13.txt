An Israeli ministerial committee decided on Wednesday to
officially name last year's 34-day war against the Shiite
Hezbollah militia "The Second Lebanon War," a minister said.


"We have decided to call it 'The Second Lebanon War' because that
is what it is known as to most of the population," minister
without portfolio Yaakov Edri told Channel 10 television.


The official name still has to be approved by Sunday's cabinet
meeting.


On Monday the same committee officially labelled last year's July
12 to August 14 conflict a "war", where previously Israeli
officials had called variousl called it a campaign, fighting,
offensive or operation.


Rockets fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon into northern Israel
killed 39 civilians during the war and wounded hundreds more, and
119 members of the Israeli military were killed in the conflict.


In Lebanon there were more than 1,100 killed, mostly civilians,
and more than 4,000 wounded.


The Israeli media has long referred to the 2006 conflict as "The
Second Lebanon War."


The first was in 1982, when Israel invaded its northern neighbour
in an operation codenamed "Peace in Galilee."


Failures in last summer's war against Hezbollah prompted
demonstrations by military reservists and are also the focus of
several Israeli commissions of inquiry.
