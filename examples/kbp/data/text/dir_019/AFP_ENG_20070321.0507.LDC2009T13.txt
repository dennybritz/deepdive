Following is the text of the Federal Reserve statement at the
conclusion of the US central bank's latest policy meeting
Wednesday:


"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its
target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.


"Recent indicators have been mixed and the adjustment in the
housing sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely
to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.


"Recent readings on core inflation have been somewhat elevated.
Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,
the high level of resource utilization has the potential to
sustain those pressures.


"In these circumstances, the committee's predominant policy
concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as
expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution
of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied
by incoming information.


"Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S.
Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Thomas M.
Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Cathy E. Minehan;
Frederic S. Mishkin; Michael H. Moskow; William Poole; and Kevin
M. Warsh."
