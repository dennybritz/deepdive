Reports of sexual assaults involving members of the US military
increased by 24 percent in 2006 over the previous year, the
Pentagon reported Wednesday.


In an annual report to Congress, the Pentagon said the increase
may have been due to a change in the military's policy, allowing
victims to report alleged assaults confidentially.


"There were 2,947 total reports of alleged sexual assault cases
involving members of the armed forces," the report said.


"Reports increased by 24 percent from 2005, which may reflect
victims' increased confidence in the reporting structure," it
said.


But the report said the extent to which the new policy encouraged
more service members to report sexual assaults was not clear
since 2006 was the first full year it was in effect.


In total, 756 reports of sexual assaults were made confidentially
in 2006 compared to 435 the previous year.


Criminal investigations were completed on 2,277 sexual assault
reports and commanders took action in 780 cases. There were 292
court martials, most of them from cases reported in 2005, the
report said.


"Studies show that sexual assault is the most underreported
violent crime in society," said Cynthia Smith, a Pentagon
spokeswoman.


"So the department placed special emphasis on removing barriers
to reporting and creating a climate of confidence that the armed
forces will address all aspects of sexual assault," she said.


"We expected those efforts, as well as increased training and
improved victim services, would prompt many more victims to come
forward, and we expected the numbers to increase this year."
