Toronto Raptors star Andrea Bargnani had an appendectomy on
Wednesday and will be sidelined indefinitely.


The top overall pick in last year's National Basketball
Association entry draft, the rookie forward underwent a
successful procedure for a non-perforated acute appendix at Mount
Sinai Hospital.


Bargnani will spend several days in the hospital. No timetable
has been established for his return.


Bargnani is one of the reasons the Raptors (36-31) hold a
surprising five- and-a-half game lead in the Atlantic Division as
they track their first playoff berth in five years.


After a slow start, the 21-year-old Italian has become Toronto's
first big man off the bench and has displayed the ability to
score both inside and on the perimeter. In 64 games, he is
averaging 11.5 points and 3.9 rebounds, shooting nearly 38
percent from the arc.
