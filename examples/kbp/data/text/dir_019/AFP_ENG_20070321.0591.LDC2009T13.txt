Ireland's joy at their successful World Cup run was tempered on
Wednesday whe the Irish Cricket Union announced that former
president Bob Kerr had died in Jamaica.


The 68-year-old had been in Kingston watching the World Cup.


Adrian Birrell, coach of the Ireland team said, "This is tragic
news, and on behalf of the entire squad and management, I'd like
to pass on our sympathy and condolences to his wife Hope, and his
family circle. Bob was a great ambassador for Irish cricket, and
worked tirelessly in his various roles within cricket."


Kerr was ICU chairman from 2000-2002, and president in 2004.
