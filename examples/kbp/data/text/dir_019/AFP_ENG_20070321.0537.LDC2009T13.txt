Moroccan authorities have arrested 24 suspects in connection with
a suicide bombing in Casablanca earlier this month that killed
one person and injured four others, a government source said
Wednesday.


Two hundred people have been questioned in the investigation, an
interior ministry official said. Police continue to search for
six suspects.


Those arrested are between 18 and 27 years old, and most are from
the poor neighborhood of Sidi Moumen, where the attack occurred.
Twelve of them were potential suicide bombers, the official said.


The bomber, Abdelfettah Raydi, was killed in the blast at an
Internet cafe on March 11. His alleged accomplice, Youssef
Khoudri, was injured and arrested when he attempted to flee.


Government ministers have said the suspects were seeking
"economic targets," such as the Casablanca port, as well as
tourist spots in Tanger, Essaouira and Marrakech. They have also
said the attack was locally planned.
