Ireland's most capped ever fly-half David Humphreys agreed a one
year contract extension with Ulster on Wednesday but insisted it
would be his last one.


The 35-year-old fulfilled his province's wishes to stay on as
they will most likely be without fellow fly-half Paddy Wallace
for the duration of Ireland's World Cup campaign, which gets
underway on September 7.


Humphreys, whose finest moment in nearly 10 years of service with
Ulster came in captaining them to the 1999 European Cup title,
will probably turn his hand to law after retiring as he is a
qualified solicitor - he has also been awarded by Queen Elizabeth
II, the Member of the British Empire (MBE).


"This is the last contract, definitely," Humphreys told the
Belfast Telegraph.


Humphreys is presently the record holder for caps as fly-half for
the Irish with 72 - scoring 560 points - but that is certain to
change as long-time rival Ronan O'Gara has 71 going into the
World Cup.
