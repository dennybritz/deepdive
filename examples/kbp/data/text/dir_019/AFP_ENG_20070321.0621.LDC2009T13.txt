Paul McCartney's first studio album in nearly two years will be
released on the newly launched Hear Music label set up by coffee
giants Starbucks, a statement said Wednesday.


The legendary Beatles singer-songwriter would release the album
on Hear Music later this year, for sale at traditional retail
outlets as well as Starbucks coffee houses.


Hear Music was launched by Starbucks and the Concord Music Group
earlier this month.


The announcement was made at the Starbucks Annual shareholders
meeting where McCartney made a surprise appearance via satellite,
expressing his excitement at working with Hear Music.


"For me, the great thing is the commitment and the passion and
the love of music, which as an artist is good to see," said
McCartney, 64.


"It's a new world now and people are thinking of new ways to
reach the people, and for me that's always been my aim."


Starbucks Entertainment and Concord Music Group's past
collaborations include Ray Charles' "Genius Loves Company," which
has sold 5.5 million copies worldwide and won eight Grammy
Awards.
