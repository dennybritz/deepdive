The US stock market rallied Wednesday after the Federal Reserve
announced, in a widely expected move, that it was keeping its key
short-term interest rate anchored at 5.25 percent.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up a strong 159.58 points
(1.30 percent) at 12,447.68 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite finished 47.71 points (1.98 percent) higher
at 2,455.92 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 rose a
significant 24.03 points (1.70 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,434.97.


Analysts said the market had gained reassurance from the Fed's
announcement, partly as some Fed watchers observed that the
central bank was now indicating a rate hike was less likely.


"They did downgrade their assessment of the economy but it
doesn't seem like they're too worried about a slowdown," said
Scott Anderson, a senior economist at Wells Fargo.
