The father of actor Woody Harrelson has died in prison where he
was serving two life sentences for murdering a judge nearly 30
years ago, officials said Wednesday.


Charles Harrelson, 69, was found unconscious in his cell at
Colorado's maximum- security Supermax facility and was believed
to have died from natural causes, Federal Bureau of Prisons
spokeswoman Felicia Ponce told AFP.


"We believe it may have been a heart attack but we are awaiting
confirmation from the autopsy results," said Ponce.


Harrelson was jailed for the 1979 killing of US district judge
John Wood in Texas. Prosecutors said a drug dealer had hired
Harrelson to gun down the judge because he did not want him to
oversee his upcoming trial.


Wood was renowned for handing down stiff sentences to drug
dealers. Harrelson denied murder, claiming he was hundreds of
miles away at the time of the killing.


He was moved to Supermax prison in 2003. The prison is home to
some of the highest-profile criminals in America, including
Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, 1993 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi
Yousef and 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui.


Harrelson's son Woody found fame as the dim-witted bartender in
long-running sitcom "Cheers" before going on to appear in a
string of hit films including "Indecent Proposal," "Natural Born
Killers" and "The People vs Larry Flynt."
