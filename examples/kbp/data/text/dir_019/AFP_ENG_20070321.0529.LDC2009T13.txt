Portugal's Socialist government on Wednesday reduced its budget
deficit forecast for 2007 to 3.3 percent of gross domestic
product from 3.7 percent previously.


Prime Minister Jose Socrates told parliament the new target would
ensure the deficit falls below a European Union ceiling of 3.0
percent of GDP imposed on the 13 countries that use the euro
single currency next year.


"Our conviction is reinforced in this way that already in 2008
Portugal will be below three percent and will no longer be in a
situation of having an excessive deficit with regard to its
European commitments," he said.


Earlier this week national statistics institute INE said the
deficit was 3.9 percent last year, down from 6.0 percent in 2005
and below a government estimate of 4.6 percent.


Socrates, who came to power in March 2005, said the deficit
reduction was proof that his austerity measures and reforms  --
which have sparked street protests and strikes by public workers
-- were bearing fruit.


"This is without a doubt an extraordinary result," he said.


The Portuguese economy expanded 1.3 percent in 2006, its highest
rate in five years, up from revised growth of 0.5 percent in the
previous year, boosted by strong export growth.
