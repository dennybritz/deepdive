Global health experts Wednesday urged the US Congress to take a
larger role in preventing the development of resistant strains of
tuberculosis, one of the world's leading infectious killers.


Dr. Mario Raviglione, who heads the UN's World Health
Organization's Stop TB Partnership, told a House of
Representatives foreign affairs panel that tuberculosis, or TB,
was becoming a larger and more deadly threat.


The airborne disease, which has been readily curable for half a
century, remains the deadliest infectious disease on the planet
after AIDS and ahead of malaria, according to the WHO.


WHO is to release a report Thursday, two days ahead of World TB
Day, on the evolution of the illness which affects nine million
people a year across the world and kills between 1.6 million and
two million people annually.


Raviglione did not release details of the report, but did urge
Congress to contribute to a plan to stem the disease worldwide by
2015.


"If fully financed at 56 billion dollars over 10 years, it could
save 14 million lives and enable access to new tools to fight and
eliminate TB," Raviglione said.


Adding that the program lacked 30 billion dollars needed to go
forward, he urged "all partners ... (to) expand their support
substantially."


Treatments must be adhered to for six to nine months. Patients'
failure to complete the treatments has resulted in new strains of
drug-resistant tuberculosis, raising the specter of a growing
epidemic.
