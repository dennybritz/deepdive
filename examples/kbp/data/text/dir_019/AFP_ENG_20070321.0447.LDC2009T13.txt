Google said on Wednesday it has started testing Internet ads with
fees based on whether viewers take actions such as calling stores
or making purchases.


Prices for "pay-per-action" ads are based on whether potential
customers follow through by signing up for newsletters,
contacting stores, making purchases or other deeds specified by
advertisers.


Internet ads are commonly priced on a "pay-per-click" basis, with
advertisers billed depending on the number of times links
displayed on website pages are clicked on.


Pay-per-click advertising has been criticized for being
vulnerable to fraud by malicious competitors or others that use
computer programs to repeatedly click on ads to drive up
advertisers' costs.


Mountain View, California-based Internet search powerhouse Google
said it is testing the model with US advertisers.
