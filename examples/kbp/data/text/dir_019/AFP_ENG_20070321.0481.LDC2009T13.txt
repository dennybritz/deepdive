The big power Middle East mediators called on the the new
Palestinian unity government Wednesday to demonstrate a "clear
and credible" commitment to making peace with Israel as a
condition for lifting an international aid embargo.


A statement issued by the top diplomats of the United States,
Russia, United Nations and European Union reaffirmed their
position withholding recognition or aid from the Palestinian
government unless its Islamist leaders formally renounce violence
and recognize Israel's right to exist.
