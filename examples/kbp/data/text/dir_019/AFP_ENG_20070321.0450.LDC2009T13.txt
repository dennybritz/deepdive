Former Pro Tour series winner Danilo Di Luca has been ruled out
of Saturday's Milan-San Remo classic cycling race as he is still
suffering from the after- effects of flu, the Gazzetta dello
Sport's website reported on Wednesday.


The illness forced the 31-year-old Italian to miss the Tirreno-
Adriatico one- week stage race, which ended on Tuesday.


Di Luca, who rides for the Liquigas team, won the Milano-Turin
one-day semi- classic earlier this month. His best season was in
2005 when he was crowned Pro Tour champion.


That year he won the Tour of the Basque country stage race and
the Amstel Gold and Fleche Wallonne one-day classics, before
finishing fourth overall in the Giro d'Italia.
