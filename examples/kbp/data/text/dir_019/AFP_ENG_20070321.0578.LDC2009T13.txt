Norway's Jens Arne Svartedal won the World Cup nordic skiing
sprint crown despite finishing only 12th in the final race of the
season here on Wednesday.


Russian Michail Devjatiarov won the 1.1km sprint classic ahead of
Swedes Emil Joensson and Mats Larsson.


But world champion Svartedal, who won two of the eight sprints
this season, did just enough to conserve his lead in the sprint
standings.


German Tobias Angerer was already assured of winning the overall
World Cup crystal globe ahead of the final pursuit race in Falun,
Sweden on Saturday.
