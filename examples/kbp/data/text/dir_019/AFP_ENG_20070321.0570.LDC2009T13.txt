Four people have been released and four more arrested on
Wednesday by police probing the death of a 15-year-old boy in the
latest of a string of fatal stabbings in London.


Adam Regis, nephew of retired British Olympic sprinter John
Regis, was found with stab wounds late Saturday in east London,
near Premiership football club West Ham's ground.


Four men in their late teens or early 20s were arrested Wednesday
night in Upton Park and Forest Gate, east London.


The move came after a 17-year-old boy arrested on Tuesday morning
by London's Metropolitan Police was released on bail on Wednesday
morning.


On Tuesday evening, police also arrested three men aged 19, 20
and 22 at an address in Beckton, east London. They have now been
released without charge.


"We stress that the investigation continues and that all our
points of appeal remain," a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.


"All lines of inquiry remain open".


Regis's death came amid growing concern that there is a
spiralling knife and gun culture among young people in the
British capital.


Last week, another young Briton, Kodjo Yenga, was killed in a
knife attack in Hammersmith, west London.


And last month, armed police went on patrol in some parts of
London after four people, including three teenagers, were shot
within days.


Asked about the deaths during his weekly question-and-answer
session in the lower House of Commons, Prime Minister Tony Blair
said: "This is a very specific problem in specific cultures and
specific parts of our inner cities".


He pledged to unveil further proposals to deal with the issue in
the coming weeks.
