A pack of four rottweiler dogs mauled a 60-year-old woman to
death in Portugal on Wednesday as she walked to work, authorities
said.


Police had to fire bullets into the air to frighten the dogs away
and allow an ambulance crew to reach the woman, an immigrant from
the Ukraine, as she lay injured on a road near the town of Sintra
just outside of Lisbon, a local firefighter commander said.


She died from her injuries before reaching a hospital, he said.


The dogs escaped from a nearby house and police said they were
investigating to see if their owner had a licence to keep them as
pets.


Rottweilers are one of seven dog breeds which under Portuguese
law must be registered by their owners with local authorities
because of the danger they potentially pose to humans and other
animals.


The four dogs were taken to a kennel where they will be put down,
police said. It was the first death from a dog attack in Portugal
since 2002.
