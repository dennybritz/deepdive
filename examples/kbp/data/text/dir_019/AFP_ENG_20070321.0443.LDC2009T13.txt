An Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit, delayed since
2006, will now be held next March in Senegal, the Senegalese
press agency reported Wednesday.


The summit will be held March 8 to 14, 2008, in Dakar, the press
agency said, citing organiser Karim Wade, who is also the son of
Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade.


The organisation's 11th summit has been delayed twice. It was
initially scheduled for 2006, then moved to 2007, mostly to allow
for construction work to be completed.


Hotels, conference rooms, bridges and roads are being worked on
to accommodate the summit.


The OIC includes 57 states and seeks to promote solidarity among
members.


Senegal previously hosted the summit in December 1991.
