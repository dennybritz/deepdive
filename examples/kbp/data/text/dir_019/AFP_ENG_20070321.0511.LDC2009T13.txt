The Federal Reserve held its base interest rate steady Wednesday
at 5.25 percent, saying the latest indicators on the US economy
were "mixed."


The unanimous decision, widely expected by economists and
financial markets, leaves the federal funds rate where it has
been since last June.


"Recent indicators have been mixed and the adjustment in the
housing sector is ongoing," the Federal Open Market Committee
said. "Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to
expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters."


The Fed statement said inflation pressures have been "somewhat
elevated" but "seem likely to moderate over time."


However, the Fed said the "high level of resource utilization has
the potential to sustain those (inflation) pressures."


The statement noted that under these circumstances, "the
Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that
inflation will fail to moderate as expected."


The redraft of the Fed's policy statement to reflect the latest
economic developments made no specific mention of what some see
as an emerging crisis in the "subprime" mortgage sector, the
riskiest segment of the housing market.


It differed from the January 31 statement by removing a reference
to a possible "additional firming," or hike in rates.


Instead, the FOMC said, "Future policy adjustments will depend on
the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic
growth, as implied by incoming information."
