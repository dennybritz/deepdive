Spanish prosecutors have dropped a legal case against pro-
independence Basque leader Arnaldo Otegi for "glorifying
terrorism," a Spanish judicial source said Wednesday.


The prosecution had been calling for a jail term of 15 months for
Otegi, the spokesman of the banned political wing of Basque
separatist group ETA.
