The union of professional French football clubs (UCPF) has
decided to implement a number of measures to combat violence in
football grounds following a meeting on Wednesday.


The UCPF pledged to improve security around stadiums to stop
people bringing smoke bombs and explosive devices into the
stands.


They also said they would: "remove offensive banners and chants
and slogans that could incite hate and violence."


Xenophobic and violent behaviour was also high on the agenda and
will be among a number of types of behaviour that will be
officially banned.


French football was beset by violence earlier this month during
the St Etienne- Lyon derby and Paris St Germain's trip to Sedan.
