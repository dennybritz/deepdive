Algerian prosecutors demanded a life sentence Wednesday for Rafik
Khalifa, the head of the bank at the centre of Algeria's biggest
ever corruption scandal.


The 40-year-old tycoon has been in exile in London since 2003,
when hundreds of millions of dollars was discovered missing form
the Khalifa Bank, and Algeria is trying to extradite him.


Life has also been requested for nine other suspects being tried
in absentia in the case.
