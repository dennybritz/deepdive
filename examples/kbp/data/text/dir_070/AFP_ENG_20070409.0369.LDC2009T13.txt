Belgian former world champion Tom Boonen will race in Wednesday's
Gent-Wevelgem Pro Tour race, his Quick Step team said Monday.


Boonen was a doubt after suffering a heavy fall in Sunday's Tour
of Flanders.


"My wrist and knee are still hurting," said the 26-year-old. "I
feel fit to ride but I'm not looking at how this might evolve
over the coming days. I'll see how I feel during the race."
