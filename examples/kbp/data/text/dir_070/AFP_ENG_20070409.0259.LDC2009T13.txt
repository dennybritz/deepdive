Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu made a lightning trip
to Iraq on Monday and said the withdrawal of Romanian forces from
the country was one of his top priorities, officials said.


Melescanu, who was named defence minister last week following a
cabinet reshuffle, made an "informational visit on the Iraqi
theater of operations," along with several Romanian army
officers, the defence ministry said.


The minister handed out medals, Easter eggs and cakes as he met
members of the Romanian contingent stationed since early February
in Tallil in southern Irak.


Romania has 605 troops in Iraq, including over 400 in Tallil
charged with monitoring checkpoints and oil facilities, and
another 100 in the main southern city of Basra where they protect
UN personnel.


President Traian Basescu said in late March that the Supreme
Defence Council considered the "mission (had been) on the whole
fulfilled" by the batallion in Basra, hinting at an imminent
withdrawal of those troops.


Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu also said he would seek the
withdrawal of all Romanian troops from Iraq by Christmas
following agreement with his country's allies.
