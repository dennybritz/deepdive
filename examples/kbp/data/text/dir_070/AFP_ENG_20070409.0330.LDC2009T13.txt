Leonardo DiCaprio is in talks to star in a new drama about a CIA
agent hunting for a top Al-Qaeda leader, it was reported on
Monday.


DiCaprio, who received an Oscar nomination this year for his
performance in action-adventure "Blood Diamond," is being lined
up for a movie adaptation of David Ignatius's novel "Body of
Lies," Variety reported.


British filmmaker Ridley Scott ("Gladiator," "Blade Runner") is
to direct the movie, Variety reported. Oscar-winning screenwriter
William Monahan ("The Departed") will provide the script, the
report added.


DiCaprio, who is set to reunite with "Titanic" co-star Kate
Winslet in a Sam Mendes drama "Revolutionary Road," will play an
ex-journalist-turned CIA agent who is sent to Jordan to track an
Al-Qaeda leader planning attacks on America.
