Disgraced former 100m world record-holder Tim Montgomery pleaded
guilty to fraud Monday in connection with a five million dollar
check scam, court officials said.


Montgomery, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to
commit bank fraud and two counts of bank fraud, a clerk in the
Manhattan Federal Court said, asking not to be named.


Neither prosecutors nor Montgomery's lawyer were immediately
available to provide further details.


The Virginian Pilot newspaper carried a statement from
Montgomery's lawyer in which the 2000 Sydney Olympic 4x100 gold
medal relay member said: "I sincerely regret the role I played in
this unfortunate episode.


"I have disappointed many people and for that I am truly sorry. I
look forward to moving past this event and being a positive
influence in my community in the future," he added.


Montgomery is due to be sentenced in November, according to the
report.


Eleven other people, including Montgomery's coach, Steven
Riddick, a 1976 Montreal Olympic gold medalist, was also charged
over the scheme, which allegedly involved the depositing of fake,
stolen or altered checks.


Riddick was due in court on Tuesday.


Montgomery retired in late 2005 after receiving a two-year ban
for doping by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. All of his
placings since March 31, 2001, were stricken, including his 100m
world record of 9.78 seconds from 2002.


The record was in any case broken in 2005 by Jamaican sprinter
Asafa Powell.
