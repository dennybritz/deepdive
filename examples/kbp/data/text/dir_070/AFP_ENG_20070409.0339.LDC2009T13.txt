A Spanish court ruled Monday there was not enough evidence to
bring criminal charges of glorifying terrorism against the leader
of banned Basques separatist party Batasuna.


Arnaldo Otegi had faced possible charges after he paid tribute on
September 20, 2003 in the Basque port city of Bilbao to ETA
member Arkaitz Otazua who was killed a few days earlier in a
clash with police.


Public prosecutors had recommended that he not be charged.


Otegi was charged in a separate case with praising terrorism at a
tribute to ETA suspect Olaia Castresana, who accidentally blew
herself up when manipulating explosives in 2001.


But last month another court acquitted Otegi after public
prosecutors withdrew the charge.


His acquittal was criticized by the conservative opposition,
which accuses the Socialist government of being soft on
terrorists.


In November 2005, Otegi was handed a one-year term for calling
King Juan Carlos "chief torturer" of the Basques but avoided jail
as all sentences under two years in Spain are suspended.
