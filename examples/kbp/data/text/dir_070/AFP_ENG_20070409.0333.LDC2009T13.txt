Everton striker James Vaughan severed an artery in his left leg
during his side's 1-1 draw at Bolton on Monday.


Vaughan, 18, was rushed to hospital after suffering the injury in
a challenge with Abdoulaye Meite midway through the second half
at the Reebok Stadium.


The teenager had scored Everton's equaliser in the 33rd minute
after Kevin Davies put Bolton in front.


Everton boss David Moyes said: "When I saw Andy Johnson shout
over I thought it was really bad and it is bad. The blood was
really severe and was spurting out.


"The doctors have sewn him up and he's gone off to hospital, but
he is a tough boy so he will probably want to play next week."
