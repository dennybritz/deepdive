Four Pakistan army soldiers were killed and two injured when
their vehicle was blown up in a landmine blast in southwestern
Baluchistan province Monday, security officials said.


The soldiers were on a patrol in Tratani town of Kohlu district,
450 kilometres (280 miles) southeast of the provincial capital
Quetta when their jeep hit a landmine, a security official said.


"Four soldiers were killed in the blast and two others were
wounded," the official said requesting anonymity.


He said about a dozen people had been detained for questioning
after the blast.


The impoverished province has been wracked by an insurgency since
late 2004 by rebel tribes who want a greater share of profits
from the region's rich resources.


Beeberg Baluch, a spokesman for the Baluchistan Liberation Army
which opposes President Pervez Musharraf's plan to build several
military bases in the province, claimed responsibility for the
blast.


He said that more than a dozen soldiers were killed when its
militants detonated a remote controlled bomb and also exchanged
gunfire with troops moving in a three-vehicle convoy. Officials
denied the claim.


The violence in Baluchistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran,
including attacks on railways, electricity lines and government
installations, subsided after rebel chieftain Nawab Akbar Bugti
was killed by the army in August 2006 but has risen again in
recent months.
