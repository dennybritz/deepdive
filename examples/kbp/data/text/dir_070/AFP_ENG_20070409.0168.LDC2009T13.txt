The world's top gas producers meeting in Doha on Monday said they
would create a committee led by Russia to assess the "market
situation" of the industry following talks about forming an OPEC-
like cartel, the Qatari energy minister said.


"We have agreed to form a technical committee headed by Russia to
assess and evaluate the market situation and other related
matters to the gas industry," Abdullah al-Attiyah told reporters.


The agreement followed a meeting of delegates to discuss the
possibility of a cartel.


But Russian Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko told reporters: "I
believe the gas forum should continues to function as it is."


The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), founded in 2001, groups
15 of the world's gas-rich nations, including Russia, Iran, Qatar
and Algeria, which together hold more than 70 percent of
reserves.


Attiyah said the next ministerial meeting would be in Moscow.
