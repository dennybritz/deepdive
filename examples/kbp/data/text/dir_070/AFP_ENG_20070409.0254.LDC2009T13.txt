Iran said on Monday that it would not announce how many
centrifuges have been installed at its Natanz nuclear plant,
after saying it has reached an industrial phase of uranium
enrichment.


"The number of centrifuges at the moment is clear but we do not
want to announce how many," Mohammad Saeedi, the deputy head of
Iran's atomic energy organisation, was quoted as saying by the
ISNA news agency.


Some observers had expected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to
disclose how many centrifuges Iran had installed to enrich
uranium at the plant during a keynote speech earlier. But the
president held off from giving figures.


Saeedi told reporters to wait for announcements not from Iran but
the Vienna- based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
whose inspectors are still making regular visits to Iranian
nuclear plants.


"You can wait for the agency inspectors to report in 20 days," he
said. Iran has said its target is to install 3,000 centrifuges at
the Natanz plant.


Asked by journalists earlier if Iran has started injecting
uranium feedstock gas into 3,000 centrifuges at the plant, top
nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani simply replied: "Yes".


However he did not give details on how many centrifuges had been
installed.
