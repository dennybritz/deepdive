Russia's average annual alcohol consumption has reached 15 litres
(26 pints) per person, nearly tripling the 1990 average of 5.4
litres, the country's consumer protection agency said Monday.


"The ever higher consumption of alcohol by adolescents and women
is especially worrying and significantly increases the risk of
the appearance of alcohol- related illnesses," the agency, called
Rospotrebnadzor, said in a statement on its website.


The new average was also far higher than the 9.7 litres of
alcohol Russians put away in 2005, when some 2.3 million of the
country's 142 million people were considered alcoholics,
according to Rospotrebnadzor.


While Russians still drink a lot of vodka, they are consuming
ever more beer and other drinks with low alcohol levels. The
production of such drinks increased six-fold between 1998 and
2006, and sales were multiplied by three over the same period.


Last year, 12 billion litres of alcohol were sold in Russia, of
which 75 percent was beer, 16 percent vodka and other hard
liquor, eight percent wine and one percent cognac.


The number of alcohol-linked deaths meanwhile dropped to 28,386
in 2006 from 40,877 a year earlier, but they still represented 12
percent of all deaths in Russia.


The sale of home-brewed alcohol also continued to kill: 1,074
people died after drinking bad moonshine last year alone,
according to Rospotrebnadzor.


The agency said five percent of alcohol sold in 2006 did not
conform to sanitary criteria, up from 2.6 percent a year earlier.
