The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) voiced
concern Monday about the worsening situation in Sri Lanka, urging
all sides to respect humanitarian law.


"The number of casualties caused by deliberate attacks on
civilians has sharply increased in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka," the ICRC said in a press release.


"Only last week some 30 people were killed and more than 50
injured as a result of two bomb attacks on civilian buses and
other violent incidents."


The ICRC referred in particular to an attack on a public bus in
the Vavuniya district on Saturday, 250 kilometres (155 miles) to
the north of the capital Colombo, where an anti-personnel
landmine exploded, killing eight people and injuring 25.


The organisation called on all parties to the conflict to respect
the rules and and principle of humanitarian law, in particular by
distinguishing between civilians and combatants.


Since 1972, at least 60,000 people have lost their lives in the
violent struggle by Tamil insurgents, who are fighting for
independence for the north and north east areas of Sri Lanka.
