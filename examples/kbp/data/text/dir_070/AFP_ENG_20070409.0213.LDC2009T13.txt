One person died and a further seven were infected in a recent
anthrax outbreak in Guinea-Bissau that was apparently caused by
eating bad meat, the health ministry said on Monday.


Eight cases of the disease were recorded in Bissaora, a town
north of the capital Bissau, between March 24 and April 6, said
the ministry's director general, Placido Cardoso.


"The people affected by the disease had eaten contaminated meat
during a traditional mass circumcision ceremony," he said.


Cardoso did not say where the bad meat had come from but said a
veterinary team had been sent to the region.


He added that five cows had been recorded with anthrax in
Quinhacam village, in the same area, and the local population had
been warned against eating meat of uncertain origin.


In 2005, five people died during an anthrax epidemic in several
villages in the Mansoa region, east of Bissau.


Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the Bacillus anthracis
bacteria, found in wild cattle and domestic livestock. It can be
caught by humans through exposure to infected animals or their
undercooked meat.
