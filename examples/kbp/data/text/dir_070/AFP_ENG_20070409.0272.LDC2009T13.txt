Police in the Detroit suburb of Troy, Michigan have surrounded a
building where a man has reportly shot three people.


A police receptionist contacted by AFP could not confirm the
number of people shot or how serious the injuries were, but said
the shooter was still inside the building. She was also unable to
confirm the type of business in question.


Live video shown Monday on CNN showed workers fleeing down the
front steps, as police trucks shielded them from the potential
line of fire.


The network reported that some employees might still be
barricaded inside the building.
