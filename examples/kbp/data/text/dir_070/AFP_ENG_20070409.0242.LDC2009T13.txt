Iran's defiant announcement Monday that it had expanded its
nuclear enrichment program proves that UN sanctions against
Tehran were justified, the State Department spokesman said.


Spokesman Sean McCormack called a speech in which Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the Islamic republic would
defend its atomic program "to the end" a "missed opportunity" by
the increasingly isolated regime in Tehran.
