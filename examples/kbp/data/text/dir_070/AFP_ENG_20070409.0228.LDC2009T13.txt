Heavy fighting that left "many" dead erupted Monday between Chad
government forces and rebels who had crossed the Sudanese border
to enter eastern Chad, a government spokesman said.


At least eight government soldiers and "many" rebels were killed
in the clashes, said spokesman Hourmadji Moussa Doumgor in a
statement.


The fighting came less than a week after government forces bombed
rebel positions in the east of the country, where unrest has
taken off again following a relative calm since February.


"A column of more than 200 vehicles with armed elements attacked
a defence and security forces position this morning at
Amdjerima," said government spokesman Hourmadji Moussa Doumgor in
a statement.


"The defence and security forces fought back with determination
to rout the attackers, who as usual had come from Sudan. The
search goes on," the spokesman added.


Chadian authorities said the rebels were from the Union for
Forces of Democracy and Development of Mahamat Nouri, the Rally
for Democratic Forces, which is led by brothers Tom and Timan
Erdimi and the Chadian National Concorde of Hassan Saleh al-
Djinedi.


Chad and Sudan blame each other for supporting rebels in their
respective countries. Both have refused the deployment of a UN-
mandated force to patrol their border.
