Fernando Vazquez was on Monday fired by Celta Vigo, the Spanish
first division club said.


Vazquez was in his third season at the club having earned them
promotion from the second division in his first year in charge
before guiding the club to a sixth place finish last year.


But they have struggled this season and currently sit in the
relegation zone.
