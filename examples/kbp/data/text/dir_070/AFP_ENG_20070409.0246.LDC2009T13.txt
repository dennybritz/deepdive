Manchester United fans' groups have called for calm during
Tuesday night's Champions League quarter-final return leg tie
against AS Roma at Old Trafford.


There have been fears of reprisals after United fans suffered
attacks outside the Stadio Olimpico and were then baton-charged
by riot police during the first leg in Rome, which ended in a 2-1
victory for the Italian side.


But the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association
(IMUSA) are anxious the game should not provide an excuse for the
Italian authorities to prove their strong-arm tactics were
justified.


"We all need to make sure that there are no headlines in
Manchester to wipe out the memory of those made by the Italian
police last week in Rome," said IMUSA in a statement.


"The Roma fans at Old Trafford on Tuesday will be just like most
of our fans who went to Rome last week and will be there only to
watch the football."
