A scientific congress on the Mediterranean  opened on Monday with
a warning that global warming was raising water temperatures even
in the sea's depths.


The Mediterranean Science Commission (CIESM) groups 800
researchers from 35 countries meeting in Istanbul for five days
to focus on climate change and the danger of tsunamis.


"Temperatures and salinization are rising not just at the surface
(of the Mediterranean) but concern all sea levels, right down to
the depths. This is worrying," CIESM director Frederic Brian told
the conference.


Briand also said the congress would explore ways of establishing
an early warning system for tsunamis.


He said 45 tsunamis had occurred in the Mediterranean over the
past century, and they continued to be a threat.
