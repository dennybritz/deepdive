Russia will next weekend launch its first new strategic nuclear
submarine since the downfall of the Soviet Union, Deputy Prime
Minister Sergei Ivanov told the Interfax news agency on Monday.


"This is the first time in 17 years that we are building such a
submarine. Another year will be needed to technically equip it in
water and to arm it," Ivanov said at a government meeting,
attended by President Vladimir Putin.


The nuclear submarine, named Yuri Dolgoruki, will carry Russia's
latest inter- continental missiles, the Bulava-M, which went into
production last year.


The naval Bulava ballistic missiles are equipped with 10 nuclear
warheads that have a reach of 8,000 kilometres (4,970 miles).


The new vessel will be launched on Sunday into the White Sea from
the Severodvinsk naval base in northwestern Russia.


Russia plans to build three other submarines of the same kind,
Ivanov said, adding that the Alexander Nevski and the Vladimir
Monomakh were already under construction.
