Iran's uranium enrichment has now reached an "industrial level,"
the head of its atomic energy organisation Gholam Reza Aghazadeh
announced on Monday.


"We have gathered here today to celebrate the entry of the
uranium enrichment project into an industrial level, thanks to
God's eternal blessing," Aghazadeh told a ceremony at Iran's most
sensitive nuclear plant.


He added that Iran has also started mass-producing the
centrifuges needed for the enrichment of uranium.


"Today, with the start of mass-producing centrifuges and the
start of uranium enrichment on an industrial phase, another step
was taken for the flourishing of the Islamic republic," he said.


President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was due to give a key speech on
Iran's nuclear programme shortly afterwards.
