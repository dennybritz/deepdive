President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday vowed that world powers
would not be able to stop Iran's nuclear drive and that the
Islamic republic would defend its atomic programme "to the end."


"The great Iranian nation, which for past centuries has been a
pioneer of science, will not allow some bullying powers to put
obstacles in its path of progress by influencing the
international community," he said in a speech.


"We will go on to reach the summits," he added in a keynote
address at Iran's ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment plant in
Natanz.


"Today... this country has joined the countries that produce
nuclear fuel on an industrial scale," said Ahmadinejad,
confirming an earlier announcement by Iran's atomic energy chief.


The president gave no figures over how many centrifuges Iran had
now installed at the Natanz plant.


"They should know that our nation with awareness and faith has
stood by its leadership and will defend its rights to the end,"
he added.


Ahmadinejad also warned that Iran would "reconsider its
behaviour" if it was provoked by world powers. He did not go into
further detail.


"Our nation has until this day moved on a peaceful path,
observing laws created by the world powers, and it is interested
in continuing along this path.


"But they should take care not to do something that makes Iran
reconsider its behaviour, as the Iranian nation is capable of
doing so," he said.


"We recommend to them that they had better respect nations'
rights."
