Pakistani authorities Monday reported two new cases of the deadly
H5N1 strain of bird flu in commercial poultry farms in the
country, officials said.


The virus was detected in the northwestern city of Abbotabad and
the southern port city of Karachi on Thursday and Friday,
Agriculture and Livestock Ministry spokesman Mohammad Afzal told
AFP.


"We collected samples and conducted tests after some chickens
were found dead at the two places," he said.


Some 600 chickens were slaughtered -- 350 in Karachi and about
250 in Abbotabad -- after the tests confirmed they were infected
with H5N1 virus, he said.


"The farms were small and isolated and there is nothing
alarming," he added.


The authorities last month shut down a zoo in the capital,
Islamabad, and slaughtered dozens of birds after the virus was
found in peacocks and geese.


Pakistan's first H5N1 cases were detected in March 2006 at two
chicken farms in North West Frontier Province, prompting consumer
panic and a mass slaughter at several sites.


The virus resurfaced in early February among chickens in
Rawalpindi, adjoining Islamabad, and in peacocks in the
northwestern city of Mansehra.


Pakistan produces 4.5 million chickens annually.
