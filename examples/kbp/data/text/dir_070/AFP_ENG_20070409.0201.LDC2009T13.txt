Bayern Munich midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Martin
Demichelis are doubtful for their Champions League quarter-final,
second leg against AC Milan on Wednesday, the German club said.


Schweinsteiger hurt a knee in Saturday's German league action and
Demichelis has a hamstring pull. Both scored in the 2-1 victory
at Hanover.


"His (Schweinsteiger's) absence will be a big blow but we are
still hoping he will be able to play," said Bayern coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld. Hitzfeld was less optimistic about Demichelis however
saying: "He is very doubtful."


Bayern had hoped Argentinian Demichelis would step up to the
plate in place of Frenchman Willy Sagnol, who is out for the rest
of the season after right knee surgery.


In Demichelis's absence, Bosnia's Hasan Salihamidzic could pull
back into defence allowing a midfield spot for Andreas Ottl.


Hitzfeld also confirmed veteran Mehmet Scholl, who has a calf
injury, will not be in the squad for Wednesday's match though he
is retiring in the summer and only makes rare, substitute
appearances.


Bayern and AC Milan are level at 2-2 after the first leg in
Italy.
