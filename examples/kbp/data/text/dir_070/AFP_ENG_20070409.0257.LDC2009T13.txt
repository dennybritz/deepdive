Pope Benedict XVI told Christians on Monday that they should not
fear spreading the gospel, during his traditional Easter Regina
Coeli message from his home outside Rome.


Speaking to a crowd from the balcony of his Castelgandolfo
residence, the head of the Roman Catholic Church said believers
"should not fear showing their faith in the furthest corners of
the world".


Evangelism was one of the meanings of Easter, the pope said, and
it was "urgent that men and women of our era know and meet with
Jesus".


On Sunday, he used his traditional Easter address from St Peter's
Basilica to lament suffering in the world, in particular in Iraq
and Africa.


The pope, who celebrates his 80th birthday on April 16, will
remain at Castelgandolfo until April 14 when he will return to
Rome for his weekly audience.
