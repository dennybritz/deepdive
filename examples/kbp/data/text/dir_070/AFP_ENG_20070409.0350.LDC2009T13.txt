A woman was killed and two other people injured during a Monday
morning shooting at a suburban Detroit office building, local
media reported.


Local television station WDIV identified the shooter as Anthony
Lacalamita, 38, a disgruntled worker who had recently lost his
job at an accounting firm in the building.


The company had changed the security access codes, but Lacalamita
managed to make it into the office and then made a "beeline" for
the three people he shot, a local television reporter said.


A police receptionist contacted by AFP could not confirm the
number of people shot or how serious the injuries were, but a
police spokesman told CNN the suspected shooter's vehicle had
been found and Michigan police were in the process of tracking
him down.


Live video on CNN showed workers fleeing down the front steps, as
police trucks shielded them from the potential line of fire.


The network reported that some employees were barricaded inside
the building as police searched for the shooter.


"We're barricaded in," Bill Adgate of LPL Financial told the
network.


"We've been told to lock our doors and stay down," he said,
explaining that he and his co-workers had used tables, chairs and
filing cabinets to block the three entrances to their office.
