Werder Bremen's German international defender Per Mertesacker
will be sidelined for a month with a right knee injury, the
German club confirmed Monday.


"It's an absence which could be costly for the team," said team
sporting director Klaus Allofs, ahead of their UEFA Cup quarter-
final, second leg tie against AZ Alkmaar in the Netherlands on
Thursday.


"He's going to be operated on on Tuesday and he will be out
between three and four weeks," added Allofs.


The 22-year-old limped off during Bremen's 1-0 win against
Nuremberg at the weekened which leaves the club two points behind
Bundesliga leaders Schalke 04.


Mertesacker has carved out a role for himself in the Bremen
defence after arriving from Hanvour last summer.


Werder have been decimated by injuries ahead of their UEFA Cup
tie after being held to a goalless draw at home in the first leg.
