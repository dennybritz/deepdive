The White House on Monday downplayed anti-US rallies in Iraq
called by radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and said such
demonstrations were a hopeful sign of freedom.


"While we have much more progress ahead of us -- the United
States, the coalition and Iraqis have much more to do -- this is
a country that has come a long way from the tyranny of Saddam
Hussein," said spokesman Gordon Johndroe.


Thousands of Shiites carrying Iraqi flags converged Monday in the
holy city of Najaf as the war-torn country marked the fourth
anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.


Large crowds of men, women and children, holding flags and anti-
US banners, gathered in Najaf and the nearby twin city of Kufa
for the protest which is also seen as a show of strength for the
cleric.


"I note today that Sadr called for massive protests. I'm not sure
that we've seen ... the numbers that he was seeking in his call
from his hangout in Iran," said Johndroe.


"But Iraq, four years on, is now a place where people can freely
gather and express their opinions. And that was something they
could not do under Saddam," he said as President George W. Bush
came here to push his immigration policy.


Johndroe stressed that Sadr's Mahdi Army militia was "operating
outside the rule of law in Iraq" and that such groups "will be
dealt with."
