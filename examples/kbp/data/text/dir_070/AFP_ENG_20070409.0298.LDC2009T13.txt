A German skier was killed and another injured Monday in an
avalanche near Innsbruck in the western Austrian province of
Tyrol, the Austria Press Agency reported.


One of the men was flown to Innsbruck University Hospital with
injuries after members of his group managed to dig him up. But
his 38-year-old colleague, who was buried under heavy snow, could
not be freed in time, it said.


The two men, part of a group of six from Bavaria, were skiing
near Gries in Sellraintal. The avalanche was thought to have been
caused by the ski group.


Alpine police, mountain rescue services and several helicopters
took part in the rescue effort.
