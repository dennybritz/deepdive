A total of 139,000 Mozambican babies have been born with the AIDS
virus in the last six months, according to a report released on
Monday by the United Nations Children's Fund.


The same report said that 146,000 pregnant women had been
diagonosed as being HIV carriers but a programme of drug
treatment had managed to prevent the virus from being transmitted
to some of the babies.


Like much of southern Africa, Mozambique is struggling to combat
AIDS which affects nearly 1.5 million people, around 16.2 percent
of the overall population.


Around 20,000 children under the age of five died of AIDS in the
country last year, according to figures from the health ministry.
