The US government Monday announced major WTO complaints over
copyright piracy in China and the booming country's barriers to
foreign music, films and books.


US Trade Representative Susan Schwab said the complaints, which
demand consultations with China at the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization, would be lodged on Tuesday.


"Piracy and counterfeiting levels in China remain unacceptably
high," she said in a statement.


"Inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in China
costs US firms and workers billions of dollars each year, and in
the case of many products, it also poses a serious risk of harm
to consumers in China, the United States and around the world."
