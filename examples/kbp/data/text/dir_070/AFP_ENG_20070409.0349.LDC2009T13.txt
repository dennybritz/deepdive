UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Monday hailed the orderly and calm
presidential elections in East Timor as well as early indications
of high voter turnout.


"The Secretary General is heartened that the election was
conducted in a general atmosphere of order and calm, and that the
initial indications show high voter turnout," his office said in
a statement.


"He hopes that calm will prevail while the counting proceeds and
when the results are announced."


Calling the electoral process in East Timor "an important step on
the path to peace and stability," Ban appealed to the world
community to continue providing aid as East Timor "works to ...
address challenges related to the security sector, the rule of
law, governance and development."


Vote-counting began in the former Portuguese colony Monday, after
a peaceful presidential election which saw long lines at polling
stations and raised hopes for an end to the cycle of violence
that has gripped the nation.


More than half the population of about one million was registered
to vote in the election to replace the charismatic former
guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao, amid tight security and concerns
over whether the result will be credible.


It was the first poll since East Timor declared independence in
2002, after a bloody separation three years earlier from
occupying Indonesian forces.
