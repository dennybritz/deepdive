Ethiopia said on Monday it was holding 41 prisoners of 17
nationalities arrested in Somalia and suspected of terrorism.


"Today, international terrorism is a clear and present danger to
Ethiopia's national security," a foreign ministry statement said.


Almost all states whose citizens were arrested had been notified
"in good time" after the transfer to Ethiopia, it said.


The exceptions were "a few individuals" whose dual or multiple
citizenship was being investigated.


The suspects had appeared before Ethiopia's military court which
had ruled that 29 were to be released because they played "only a
marginal role".


Five, from Tanzania, Sudan, Denmark, the United Arab Emirates and
from Sweden, had already been let go.


The New York-based group Human Rights Watch has accused Ethiopia
of running a covert program detaining foreign Islamists, with
support from Kenya, the United States and Somalia's transitional
government.
