A taxi driver was killed and 34 were people injured in a truck
bombing in the city of Cali early Monday according to Colombian
authorities, who blamed the attack on the Marxist FARC rebel
group.


Police said some 70 kilos (150 pounds) of explosives were used in
the bomb attack, which occurred shortly after midnight.


The blast destroyed the facade of the police headquarters
building in this city of two million inhabitants and badly
damaged some 30 dwellings.


"Miraculously, the death toll was not higher," police sergeant
Ricardo Ramos told AFP.


General Hipolito Herrera, director of security for Colombia's
national police force, said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia -- the country's decades- old Marxist insurgency -- was
the prime suspect.


"Everything points to the FARC," he said.


Officials said the group has stepped up its operations the
southwestern Valle del Cauca department, including Cali, its
capital.


Colombia has been at war with the 14,000-strong guerrilla group
since the 1960s.
