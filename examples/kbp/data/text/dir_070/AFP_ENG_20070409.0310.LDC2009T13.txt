The number of racist attacks in Russia rose dramatically in the
first part of the year, with 13 people killed, a Russian human
rights group said on Monday.


"In the first quarter of 2007, 49 cases of xenophobic attacks
were registered with 13 people dead and 50 injured," Alexander
Brod, the head of the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights, told the
Interfax news agency.


During the same period a year ago, 30 people were injured and two
were killed in xenophobic attacks, while only 22 people were hurt
in similar incidents in the first quarter of 2005, according to
the organisation.


People originating from former Soviet republics like Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan, Armenia and Georgia, along with North Koreans and
Africans, were the most likely to fall victim to racist attacks,
the group said.


At the end of March, another human rights organisation, Sova,
said the number of victims of racist attacks had jumped 17
percent in 2006 to 539, out of whom 54 died.
