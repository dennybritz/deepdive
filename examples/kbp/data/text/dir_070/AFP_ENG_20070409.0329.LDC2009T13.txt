Opposition parties in Guinea-Bissau said Monday they had rejected
a plan by President Joao Bernardo Vieira to keep Prime Minister
Aristide Gomes in power.


Gomes last month tendered his resignation and that of his
government following the loss of a confidence vote on March 19.


But Vieira said Friday he was opposed to dissolving parliament or
naming a new prime minister, and said he wanted to keep Gomes
instead.


"The president suggested a prime minister (Gomes) whom we
rejected," opposition spokesman Braima Sori Djalo told
journalists after a meeting with Vieira Monday.


"He said he would take his own decision in the next few days, but
didn't give any details."


Gomes's government lost the March 19 vote 54 to 28 amid criticism
over government spending and for failing to resolve a crisis over
the payment of several months' salary owed to civil servants.


The loss of the vote was a blow to Vieira, who has struggled to
govern in the impoverished west African country since returning
to power in 2005.


Vieira was overthrown from power in 1999 after 19 years of iron-
fisted rule, but returned from exile in former colonial power
Portugal to run for the presidency as an independent.
