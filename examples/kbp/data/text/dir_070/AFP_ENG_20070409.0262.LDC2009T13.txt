Sri Lanka fast bowler Chaminda Vaas admitted teammate Dilhara
Fernando did employ gamesmanship before the final ball of his
side's World Cup win over England.


England batsman Ravi Bopara needed three runs to win the Super
Eights match in Antigua but fast bowler Fernando pulled out of
his delivery before resuming his run, and clean bowling the
batsman.


"A bowler has the right to test a batsman at any time," Vaas
explained to the BBC's Sinhala Service.


"I think, as an experienced bowler, Dilhara deliberately did it."


Vaas said Dilhara Fernando wanted to test whether Bopara would
alter his stance at the moment of delivery.


"It was very important for the bowler to understand the batsman's
reaction. I think it was a very wise move by Dilhara as a senior
bowler."


Sri Lanka face New Zealand in Grenada on Thursday in their next
match as they attempt to make sure of their semi-final berth.


Vaas said: "Our batsmen and bowlers are in form. If you consider
the way we've been playing so far, I think we have a chance to
beat New Zealand."
