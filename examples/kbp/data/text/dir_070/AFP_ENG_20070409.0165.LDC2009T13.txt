Pakistan's foreign ministry Monday denied reports that a Briton
held over a plot to bomb transatlantic jets would be extradited
to Britain in exchange for six separatist leaders.


The arrest of British national Rashid Rauf in August by Pakistan
sparked a worldwide security alert and arrests in Britain amid
fears of a conspiracy to blow up airliners flying from London to
the United States.


Rauf's family last week filed a legal petition alleging that
Islamabad was negotiating with London to extradite him in return
for six wanted Baluch nationalists who are based in Britain, and
seeking to stop such a move.


"No," Pakistan foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam replied
when asked if Pakistan had any such plan, which was first
reported by Britain's Guardian newspaper in March.


Aslam said that currently Pakistan and Britain had no extradition
treaty but that a draft accord was in its final stages.


The 25-year-old Rauf faces charges including impersonation,
carrying a fake identity card and fake documents, which he
denies. He is still being held by security forces under special
anti-terror legislation.


In December an anti-terrorism court dropped terror charges
against Rauf but its order was suspended when the provincial
Punjab government appealed to a higher court.
