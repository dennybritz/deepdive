The major US share indexes opened higher Monday following an
extended weekend break as investors gained confidence from a
stronger-than-expected jobs report published late last week.


The US government said Friday that 180,000 new jobs were created
in March, much more than Wall Street had anticipated, but
investors could not trade on the news as the stock market was
closed for Good Friday.


Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 15.19 points (0.12 percent) to 12,575.39 while the Nasdaq
composite gained 5.54 points (0.22 percent) to 2,476.88.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index increased 1.60
points (0.11 percent) to 1,445.36.


The March non-farm payrolls report helped boost optimism about
the resilience of the US economy, which has cooled in the past
year.


"The data indicated that weakness in the housing and
manufacturing sector have not had a broad impact on hiring," said
Dick Green, president at Briefing.com.


Traders said the market was also bracing for the start of the
first-quarter corporate earnings season, which kicks off this
week.
