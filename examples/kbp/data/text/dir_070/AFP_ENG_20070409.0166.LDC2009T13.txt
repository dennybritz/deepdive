A Saudi man convicted of shooting dead a member of his own tribe
was executed on Monday, the interior ministry said.


Majhar al-Duseri was condemned to death by beheading in the
capital Riyadh for murdering Saad al-Duseri after an argument,
the ministry said in a statement carried by the official SPA news
agency.


The execution brings to 30 the number of death sentences carried
out by the Saudi authorities so far this year.


In 2006 at least 37 people were executed, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public by decapitation in
ultra- conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of
sharia, or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
