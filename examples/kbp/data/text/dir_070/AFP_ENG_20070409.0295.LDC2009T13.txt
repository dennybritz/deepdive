Valencia striker Fernando Morientes may be fit to play against
Chelsea in their crucial quarter-final second leg, the Spanish
club confirmed here Monday.


Morientes dislocated a shoulder when he fell just before halftime
during Spain's 1-0 win over Iceland in their Euro 2008 qualifier
on March 28.


He was initially expected to be out of action for a month but
returned to training at the end of last week.


"He's doing very well and not in any discomfort. He wants to
play," said Valencia club doctor Antonio Giner.


If he is passed fit, Morientes would play wearing a special type
of shoulder brace, which he has experimented with using in
training.


"It's this brace which has allowed him to bring forward the date
of return to playing," added Giner.
