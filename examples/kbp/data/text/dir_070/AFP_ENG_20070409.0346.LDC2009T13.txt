UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Monday urged Iran to fully comply with UN
demands that it halt sensitive nuclear fuel work, after Tehran
announced it was now producing enriched uranium on an industrial
scale.


"It is very important for any (UN) member country to fully comply
with Security Council resolutions," the UN secretary general told
reporters. "I urge the Iranian government to do so."


He was reacting to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's
announcement that his country was now producing enriched uranium
on an industrial scale and his warning that the Islamic republic
would not let world powers delay its nuclear program.


The UN Security Council has already imposed two sets of sanctions
against Iran over its failure to comply with demands that it
suspend uranium enrichment.


Enrichment of uranium is the key sticking point in the standoff
between Iran and the West as the process can produce nuclear fuel
but in highly extended form can also make the fissile core for an
atomic bomb.
