Environmental group Greenpeace warned Monday India's emission of
greenhouse gases will grow almost fourfold by 2050.


It called for laws on emissions and incentives to sectors
adopting renewable energy.


Greenpeace, in a report entitled "Energy outlook for India until
2050", suggested measures including a ban on common light bulbs
to cut emissions by four percent by 2050.


India must increase the use of renewable energy for power
generation from the current four percent to 65 percent and slash
energy consumption by half by 2050, it said.


Greenpeace climate campaigner K. Srinivas warned otherwise
India's share of global emissions would soar.


"India's contribution to global emissions will soar from 1,126
million tonnes in 2003 to 4,039 million tonnes in 2050,
increasing its share in global emissions from 4.8 to 8.7
percent," he said.


Greenpeace researcher Anand Padbhanabhan said the study was based
on data from global energy agencies.


"They are grounded in technical reality and not something we have
invented," he said.


Srinivas called for a ban on inefficient lighting and fuel-
guzzling cars.


"India must aim for cars that runs 100 kilometres (60 miles) on
two litres of fuel by 2020," he argued.


Climatologists say sea levels will increase by between nine and
88 centimetres (four and 35 inches) over 1990 levels by the end
of this century due to global warming.
