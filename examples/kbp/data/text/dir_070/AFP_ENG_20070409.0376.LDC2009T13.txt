A rocket bearing the world's fifth space tourist, US-Hungarian
Charles Simonyi, and two Russian cosmonauts docked at the
International Space Station (ISS) at 1910 GMT on Monday, the
Russian space centre said.


"The vessel docked as planned," a space centre spokesman told AFP
by telephone from Koroliev, near Moscow.


Simonyi and the cosmonauts, Oleg Kotov and Fyodor Yurchikhin,
were to enter the ISS at 2100 GMT, he said.


Simonyi is scheduled to return to Earth on April 20 together with
the current ISS team -- Russia's Mikhail Tyurin and American
Miguel Lopez-Alegria -- while the two Russian cosmonauts will
stay on for a 190-day shift in orbit.


Simonyi, who made his fortune at Microsoft, is the fifth tourist
to travel to the ISS, following the United States' Dennis Tito
(2001) and Greg Olsen (2005), South Africa's Mark Shuttleworth
(2002) and an American of Iranian origin, Anousheh Ansari (2006).


The voyage cost him 25 million dollars (19 million euros).


Space Adventures, the company that organised the trips, plans to
expand its offerings next year to include a 100-million-dollar
trip around the moon and a 100,000-dollar budget option: five
minutes of sub-orbital space flight.
