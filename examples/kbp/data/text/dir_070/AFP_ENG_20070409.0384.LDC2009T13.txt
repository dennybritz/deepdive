Wall Street shares ended mixed Monday with blue-chip issues
buoyed by an upbeat survey of the US jobs market late last week
and by lower crude oil prices, traders said.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 9.10 points (0.07
percent) at 12,569.30 just after the closing bell, while the
Nasdaq composite finished down 2.16 points (0.09 percent) at
2,469.18.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index ended up a slight
0.84 points (0.06 percent) at a preliminary close of 1,444.60.


The Dow was helped by Friday's government report that showed
180,000 new jobs were created in March, much more than
anticipated, but investors had been unable to trade on the news
with markets shut on Good Friday.


Blue-chip shares were also supported as New York oil prices
weakened by almost three dollars to 61.51 dollars a barrel
despite lingering geopolitical angst over Iran's nuclear
ambitions.


Analysts said investors were preparing for the first-quarter
earnings season, which kicks off in earnest this week with some
market-watchers predicting a robust performance from corporate
America.
