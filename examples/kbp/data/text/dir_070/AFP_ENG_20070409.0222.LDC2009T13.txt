Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"The World Cup is not the property of one or two teams. It
belongs to every one and the best team will win the Cup."


- Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar angry that critics bemoan the
absence of India and Pakistan in the Super Eights.


"The pleasing thing in Shaun being man-of-the-match is that he
took a look at his bowling in the first few games and found an
area or two where he could change things around a little bit."


- Ricky Ponting on Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait's emergence
as a real match winner.


"They are looking a real powerhouse at the World Cup but I still
think they are beatable."


- England skipper Michael Vaughan remains confident despite his
team's seven- wicket loss to the world champions.


"I think it (Bangladesh's win) was a warning that you must
respect all teams in all conditions in this competition."


- New Zealand coach John Bracewell warns against danger of
complacency.


"It is not correct to project this whole issue as a conflict of
commercial interests of the players and the BCCI. Let me clarify
that there is no conflict between the players' and the BCCI."


- India skipper Rahul Dravid denies there is a rift between the
players and the board.
