German sprinter Erik Zabel has been forced to pull out of this
week's two cycling classics in Belgium and France after falling
during Sunday's Tour of Flanders.


Zabel will not compete in Wednesday's Ghent-Wevelgem race or the
Paris-Roubaix four days later.


"Erik has been ordered to rest," Milram sporting director
Gianluigi Stanga said Monday.


Zabel was forced to withdraw from Sunday's race after suffering
serious bruising to his elbow and hip.
