The world's top gas producers meeting in Doha on Monday said they
would create a committee led by Russia to assess the "market
situation" of the industry following talks about forming an OPEC-
like cartel, the Qatari energy minister said.


"We have agreed to form a technical committee headed by Russia to
assess and evaluate the market situation and other related
matters to the gas industry," Abdullah al-Attiyah told reporters.


The agreement followed a meeting of delegates to discuss the
possibility of a cartel.


But Russian Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko, whose country is
to host the next ministerial meeting of top gas producers, told
reporters he believed the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF)
should remain unchanged.


"The GECF should continue existing as such and should keep up its
transparent and cooordinated position towards consuming
countries," the minister said.


He said the GECF would however examine gas prices. "We agreed to
launch a joint study on this issue (pricing of gas), and Russia
is prepared to be the one who organises such a study," he said.


The GECF, founded in 2001, groups 15 of the world's gas-rich
nations, including Russia, Iran, Qatar and Algeria, which
together hold more than 70 percent of reserves and over 40
percent of production.
