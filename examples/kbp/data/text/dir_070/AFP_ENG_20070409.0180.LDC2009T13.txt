Iran's uranium enrichment has now entered an "industrial level,"
the head of its atomic energy organisation Gholam Reza Aghazadeh
announced on Monday.


"We have gathered here today to celebrate the entry of the
uranium enrichment project into an industrial level, thanks to
God's eternal blessing," Aghazadeh told a ceremony at Iran's most
sensitive nuclear plant.


President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was due to give a key speech on
Iran's nuclear programme shortly afterwards.
