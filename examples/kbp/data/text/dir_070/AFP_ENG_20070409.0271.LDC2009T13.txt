The White House said Monday it was "very concerned" about Iran's
claim that it was producing enriched uranium on an industrial
scale and warned against "unacceptable" limits on Tehran's
cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.


"We are very concerned about Iran's announcement that they
entered an 'industrial stage' of nuclear fuel production,"
national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters.
