Pro Tour cycling team Unibet.com were hit with a new blow after
being excluded from two more Classics.


Unibet.com were denied participation at the Paris-Nice race last
month and Paris-Roubaix, which takes place later this month, but
have now also been barred from the Fleche Wallonne and Liege-
Bastogne-Liege races, both due off at the end of this month.


All four courses are run by ASO who said that the exclusions are
due to the laws on betting sponsorship and advertising in France
and Belgium.


The Belgian-Swedish team are sponsored by a betting website and
betting sponsorship is banned in the two countries.


However, Unibet.com have already offered to wear alternative
sponsorship on their shirts when racing in France, but that did
not grant them an invitation from ASO.


They have already raced in Belgium this season, though, at
Sunday's Tour of Flanders.


Although the laws against betting sponsorship in both countries
have existed for some time, they have not been applied until this
season.


But whereas French authorities have decided to insist the law is
adhered to, in Belgium the authorites seem to be indifferent to
its enforcement.


ASO, however, have decided to take enforcement into their own
hands.
