Iran will be obliged to pull out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty if it is subjected to further international pressure over
its atomic programme, chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani
warned on Monday.


"If they pressure us further we will have no choice but to
reconsider our membership of the NPT as parliament has ruled,"
Larijani said, referring to a law agreed by parliament last year
allowing the government to reduce cooperation with the UN nuclear
watchdog.
