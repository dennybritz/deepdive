Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Monday ordered
the overhaul of a state school that trains civil servants after
deadly violence among its students.


The president also froze new admissions for one year following
the suspected murder of cadet Cliff Muntu at the school last
Tuesday.


Four students have been expelled and are under police
investigation for the crime, which sparked outrage.


"We are suspending the admission of new cadets," Yudhoyono told
reporters, adding the freeze would help smooth the
reorganisation.


Yudhoyono, who has already described the violence at the school
as intolerable, said Muntu was the third student killed there
since 2000, although media reports said he was the fourth, and
the seventh since 1994.


The president said he would set up a team immediately to evaluate
the school over the next two months and prepare the overhaul.


Those guilty of killing Muntu should be brought to justice, he
said.


He added that the investigation should also target any teachers
involved in the violence, which he said may have been going on
for more than 15 years.
