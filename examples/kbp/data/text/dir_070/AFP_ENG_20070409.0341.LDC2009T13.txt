A Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker was on Monday damaged by
fire in the Kara sea, the Russian ministry for emergency
situations said.


Nobody was hurt and the fire did not reach the ship's nuclear
reactor, it said.


Three cabins burned out and the electricity system onboard was
damaged, ministry spokesman Nicolai Berejnoi told the Itar-Tass
news agency.


The icebreaker was to return to Murmansk for repairs and an
inquiry into the causes of the fire had been launched, he said.


Nuclear-powered icebreakers are used in waters that are
continuously covered in ice. Russia deploys them to aid shipping
in the Arctic waterways north of Siberia.
