Four civilians were wounded on Monday as Palestinian police
traded fire with members of an armed group linked to the Fatah
party in the West Bank town of Nablus, security sources said.


They said a dozen members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades opened
fire at the main police station in central Nablus, leaving the
four wounded in crossfire.


Police earlier tried to detain an Al-Aqsa member who was driving
through the city in a stolen car, but he ran off after jumping
out of the car and firing in the air, the sources said.
