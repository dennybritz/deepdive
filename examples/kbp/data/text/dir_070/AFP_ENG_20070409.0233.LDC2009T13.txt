Apple Inc. said Monday that it had now sold 100 million iPods,
describing the iconic device as the fastest-selling music player
ever.


Since the first iPod was sold in November 2001, the US company
has introduced over 10 models including the matchbook-size iPod
shuffle which hit stores in November. Current models sell for
between 79 and 249 dollars.


The pocket-sized music players, some of which can hold thousands
of songs and photos as well as playing movies, have helped turn
around Apple's financial fortunes.


The commercial success of the nifty player has reached beyond
urban hipsters to encompass Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and US
President George W. Bush, both of whom are reported to own iPods.
