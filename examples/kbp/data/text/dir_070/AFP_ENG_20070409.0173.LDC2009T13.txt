A man has admitted to spraying petrol on worshippers at a Yemeni
mosque before setting them on fire, the official Saba news agency
said on Monday.


Amran district security chief Fathul al-Qusi told the agency that
Ahmed al-Shumi confessed to the crime after he was detained and
questioned.


Thirty people were wounded, eight of them seriously, in the
attack during Muslim Friday prayers at the mosque in Amran some
60 kilometres (40 miles) north of the capital Sanaa.


The agency added that Shumi tended to the injured after the
attack and that he would undergo psychiatric tests to assess his
mental state.
