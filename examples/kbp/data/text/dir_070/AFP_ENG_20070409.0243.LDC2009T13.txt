US conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, whose works are credited with
helping define modern and minimalist art in the post-war period,
has died at the age of 78, his personal assistant said Monday.


LeWitt, who was born in Connecticut in 1928 to Russian immigrant
parents, died on Sunday in New York, his assistant Janet Passehl
told AFP.


LeWitt's works included geometric sculptures, photographs, and
bright shapes and patterns often painted directly onto gallery
walls.


His works revealed a dry sense of humor, with pieces such as his
1968 "Buried Cube Containing an Object of Importance but Little
Value."
