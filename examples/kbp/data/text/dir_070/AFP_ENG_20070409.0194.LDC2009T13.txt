Three Palestinians were killed and seven wounded in armed clashes
between two families in the southern Gaza Strip on Monday, medics
and security sources said.


A street argument degenerated into a firefight after members of
two powerful families in the town of Khan Yunis intervened, the
sources said. The three dead were all aged under 27.


Clan fights are a frequent occurrence in the lawless Gaza Strip
where clashes between supporters of the ruling Islamist Hamas
movement and the rival secular Fatah have dwindled since a unity
government deal was reached in March.
