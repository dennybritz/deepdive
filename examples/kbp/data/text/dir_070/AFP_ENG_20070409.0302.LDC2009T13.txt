Bolton missed a chance to pile the pressure on Arsenal in the
race for the Champions League as Everton fought back to draw 1-1
in their Premiership tie at the Reebok Stadium on Monday.


Sam Allardyce's side could have moved level on points with the
fourth-placed Gunners, who had to settle for a goalless draw at
Newcastle.


But they were forced to share the spoils with fellow European
hopefuls Everton, who remain three points behind in sixth - with
Bolton facing a visit to the Emirates Stadium in a crunch clash
on Saturday.


Bolton, boosted by the return of Spanish midfielder Campo to the
starting line- up, had started brightly with their first shot at
goal coming after just a minute when a header from Abdoulaye
Meite veered left of the post.


And they looked on course for victory after 18 minutes when
Joleon Lescott played Kevin Davies onside from Ivan Campo's free-
kick, allowing the striker to control the ball on his chest
before firing home from close range.


But Everton hit back and equalised in the 33rd minute through
teenager James Vaughan. His initial shot was blocked but the
rebound fell kindly for the young striker and he drove past Jussi
Jaaskelainen.


Both sides pushed for the winner but lacked quality finishing and
were forced to share the points despite a frantic scamble for the
winning goal in the dying minutes of the game.
