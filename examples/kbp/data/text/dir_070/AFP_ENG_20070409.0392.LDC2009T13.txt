The Sudanese army repelled an attack by Chad forces at the border
between the two countries, the official Sudanese news agency Suna
said on Monday, citing an army spokesman.


The agency said one Sudanese officer and 16 policemen and
soldiers were killed in the attack, which coincided with renewed
fighting between the Chadian army and rebels in eastern Chad.


It said 40 soldiers and policemen were wounded. The counting of
civilian casualties was still going on.


A senior Chad official, meanwhile, told AFP that his country's
army had pursued rebels into Sudanese territory before running
into Sudanese forces.


The official, who requested anonymity, said some 30 troops on
both sides died during the fighting, before the Chad troops
withdrew.


The Chad government officially denied that its troops crossed
into Sudan and attacked Sudanese forces.
