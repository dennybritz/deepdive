President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday vowed that world powers
would not be able to stop Iran's nuclear drive, saying the atomic
programme was on its way to the "summit."


"The great Iranian nation, which for past centuries has been a
pioneer of science, will not allow some bullying powers to put
obstacles in its path of progress by influencing the
international community," he said in a speech.


"We will go on to reach the summits," he added in a keynote
speech at Iran's ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment plant in
Natanz.


"Today... this country has joined the countries that produce
nuclear fuel on an industrial scale," said Ahmadinejad,
confirming an earlier announcement by Iran's atomic energy chief.


The president gave no figures over how many centrifuges Iran had
now installed at the Natanz plant.


"They should know that our nation with awareness and faith has
stood by its leadership and will defend its rights to the end,"
he added.
