Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Monday that an academic
who has drafted a controversial new constitution for the
territory has been named the island's top China policy-maker.


Chen Ming-tung, a professor at National Taiwan University, will
succeed Joseph Wu as chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, a
chief aide to the premier told reporters.


Chen is expected to take up his new post later this week. Wu has
been appointed Taiwan's de facto envoy to the United States.


Chen, formerly a deputy chairman of the council, caught the
limelight last month when he unveiled a draft of Taiwan's new
constitution which is sure to irk Beijing.


Taiwan's independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian appeared
to toughen his stance on Taiwan's status in March when he pledged
in a speech to push for independence and a new constitution.


Chen had pledged in his inaugural speech in 2000 that he would
not declare independence or change Taiwan's name, or seek a
referendum on independence.


Last month's controversial remarks drew criticism from the United
States, wary of the risk of being dragged into a conflict with
China.


President Chen ended the 51-year grip on power by the KMT when he
was elected the president in 2000. He was re-elected in 2004.


Beijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting
reunification, by force if necessary, despite having separate
governments since that war ended.


Taiwan and China split in 1949 at the end of a civil war after
communist forces led by Mao Zedong defeated KMT troops, who fled
to the island.
