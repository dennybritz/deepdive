President Hamid Karzai on Monday said the government had tried to
win the release of an Afghan journalist before the reporter's
"barbaric" beheading by Taliban militants.


The Taliban said they beheaded Ajmal Naqshbandi, who was captured
in southern Helmand province on March 5 with Italian journalist
Daniele Mastrogiacomo, on Sunday after the government refused to
negotiate.


"I strongly condemn this barbaric killing," Karzai was quoted as
saying in a statement issued by his office.


"The government made lots of efforts to free Ajmal but the
kidnappers barbarically killed him before their self-set deadline
ended without making any particular demand for his release,"
Karzai said.


"The release of a foreigner and beheading of two Afghans by the
Taliban proves that the Taliban, under orders from strangers,
have decided to kill Afghans and destroy Afghanistan," he said.


Mastrogiacomo was released after some two weeks in captivity
after Karzai ordered the release of five Taliban prisoners under
a controversial deal with the rebels.


The Taliban also beheaded the Afghan driver of Mastrogiacomo and
Naqshbandi.


Kidnapping has increasingly become a tactic of the Taliban, who
have been waging a guerrilla-style insurgency since they were
ousted from power in late 2001 by US-led forces.
