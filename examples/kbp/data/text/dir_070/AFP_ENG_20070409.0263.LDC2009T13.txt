About 15,000 opposition activists in Kyrgyzstan rallied Monday to
start what they hope will be a week of protests demanding
President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's resignation, a spokesman said.


The protestors "demand the resignation of Kurmanbek Bakiyev and
early presidential elections," said Azamat Kalman, spokesman for
the opposition movement For a Decent Future in Kyrgystan.


Anti-presidential forces have gained strength in recent months in
this mountainous Central Asian state, which is strategically
located near Afghanistan and hosts US and Russian air bases.


Opposition leaders promised to set up a tent camp in the capital
Bishkek's central square on Tuesday, and claimed 50,000 would
rally there on Wednesday.


Bakiyev has struggled to contain opposition in the parliament and
on the streets since he came to power in 2005 after a violent
uprising that drove out former president Aksar Akayev.


Prime Minister Almaz Atambayev, an opposition member appointed by
the president last week in an attempt to defuse the protests,
said police had been ordered not to fire on demonstrators.


"There will be no provocations from the authorities," he said.
