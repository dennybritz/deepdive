The head of Ethiopia's high court Monday quashed the most serious
charges against more than 100 defendants on trial for allegedly
plotting a coup and ordered 25 of them to be freed, witnesses
said.


Observers of the trial of Ethiopian opposition figures accused
after protests against disputed elections in 2005 said the 25
included eight journalists.


Judge Adil Ahmed ordered the charges of treason and attempted
genocide, which carried a possible death penalty, to be dropped,
saying the prosecution had provided no evidence.


Four charges, including attempting to overthrow the
constitutional order, responsibility for the deaths of 26 people
killed in demonstrations, and incitement to violence, remain.


The accused include nearly all of the leadership of the main
opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD).


The case has drawn deep concern from donors and criticism from
rights groups that maintain the government is trying to stifle
dissent in the wake of unrest following the May 2005 election
that the CUD claims was rigged.


Opposition protests against alleged massive electoral fraud
erupted into two explosions of violence in Addis Ababa and other
cities in June and November 2005 in which 193 civilians and six
police were killed.


Authorities say the CUD was attempting to overthrow the
government through nationwide protests.


The defendants adamantly deny the charges but most refused to
enter pleas, claiming the trial is a political tool to destroy
the opposition.
