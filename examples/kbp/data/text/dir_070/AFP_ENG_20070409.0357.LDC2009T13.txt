Oscar-winning US film director Woody Allen has offered a cameo
role in his next film to the Spanish actor who has dubbed his
voice into Spanish in all of his movies shown in Spain over the
past 20 years.


Joan Pera told private television channel Antena 3 on Monday that
the part in the movie, which will be filmed in Barcelona in July
and August, will be unspoken since he does not speak English very
well.


"It is something I have dreamed of, that I thought could happen
but which I didn't really expect," said Pera who has dubbed
Allen's voice in some 20 films.


Spanish film stars Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem will star in
the movie, which is still untitled.


It will be the first time that Allen has filmed in Spain. He shot
two of his last features -- "Match Point" and "Scoop" -- in
London.
