The European Commission on Monday reiterated that Iran must
"cooperate fully" with the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), after Teheran claimed it was producing enriched uranium
on an industrial scale.


"This does nothing to change our position: Iran must cooperate
fully with the IAEA and follow the United Nations resolutions,"
commission spokesman Ton Van Lierop told AFP.


Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that his country
was now producing enriched uranium on an industrial scale, and
warned that the Islamic republic would not let world powers delay
its nuclear programme.


"The great Iranian nation, which for past centuries has been a
pioneer of science, will not allow some bullying powers to put
obstacles in its path of progress by influencing the
international community," he said.


The UN Security Council has already imposed two packages of
sanctions against Iran over its failure to heed ultimatums from
the world body to suspend uranium enrichment.


Western countries fear that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear
weapon covertly under the guise of a civilian energy programme,
while Iran insists it simply wants to generate electricity.
