Two children were wounded in a mine blast while playing in a
village in southern Kosovo, police said Monday.


The blast occured close to the southern town of Prizren, 90
kilometers (55 miles) south of Pristina, after a boy found the
mine and put it in his pocket. It exploded later and injured him
and a girl, the statement said.


"The boy was sent to the main Pristina hospital because of
serious wounds. He underwent surgery and his life is in danger,
while the girl's wounds are not life threatening," the press
release said.


More than 110 civilians have been killed and 420 injured by mines
and unexploded ordnance since the end of the 1998-1999 war in
Kosovo. Some 73,700 unexploded mines have been destroyed.


The southern Serbian province has been run by the United Nations
since a NATO bombing campaign ended a crackdown by Serbian forces
against the province's ethnic Albanian majority in June 1999.
