The Sudanese army repelled an attack by Chad forces at the border
between the two countries, the official Sudanese news agency Suna
said on Monday, citing an army spokesman.


The agency said one Sudanese officer and 16 policemen and
soldiers were killed in the attack, which coincided with renewed
fighting between the Chadian army and rebels in eastern Chad.
