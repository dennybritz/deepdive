China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) announced it has
found an oil field with proven reserves of 405.1 million tonnes
of oil equivalent in north China's Bohai Bay, state media said
Friday.


The discovery has been praised by Premier Wen Jiabao, with CNPC
adding that the field could contain up to one billion tonnes of
oil equivalent, the Beijing News said.


"The discovery of the high-quality (Jidong) Nanbao oil field is
the most exciting one in more than 40 years," Wen was quoted as
saying during a visit to the field on May 1.


"I was so happy on hearing the news that I couldn't even fall
asleep."


CNPC said in a statement Thursday that Jidong Nanbao oil field,
located in the Bohai Sea near Caofeidian port in Hebei Province,
has proven reserves of 405.1 million tonnes of oil equivalent.


Jia Chengzao, an oil geologist with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, projected the new findings will lead to a rapid growth
in CNPC production in the area, the newspaper said.


However, oil analysts have said reserve figures released by
mainland state firms are often inflated compared to standards
used by Western companies when calculating how much oil can be
economically produced.


As the world's second largest oil consumer, China imported a
record 145.2 million tonnes crude oil in 2006, or 47 percent of
total consumption as domestic output stagnated, according to
earlier reports.


Imports this year are expected to account for just under half of
its needs, rising more than 10 percent to top 160 million tonnes.
