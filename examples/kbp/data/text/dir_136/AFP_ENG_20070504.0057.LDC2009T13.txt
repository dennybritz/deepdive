Suspected Islamic militants targeted music shops with explosive
devices overnight in northwest Pakistan, damaging a dozen
outlets, police said Friday.


The shops were closed when the crude home-made devices exploded
at three markets late Thursday in the town of Charsada in North
West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan, a senior police
officer said.


Local trade leaders said they received letters last week,
attributed to local Taliban, warning them to stop selling music
and video CDs because they considered them to be repugnant to the
teachings of Islam.


The three explosions added to security fears in Charsada where a
suicide bomber struck a political rally at the weekend, killing
28 people.


Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao was the target of the attack but
he escaped with minor injuries.


Islamic militancy is widespread in the deeply-conservative
province ruled by an alliance of six hardline Islamic parties.
Its tribal areas along the Afghan border are a stronghold of pro-
Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants.
