A Malaysian air force plane crashed after take-off Friday in
central Pahang state, but the pilot survived the accident, the
Royal Malaysian Air Force said.


The RMAF Hawk 208 plane crashed mid-morning on a training flight
at an airbase located at the state's capital Kuantan.


"It crashed within the airbase soon after take-off," air force
spokesman Zulkiflee Abdul Latiff said in a statement released
through the Bernama news agency.


The pilot ejected but did not suffer serious injuries, and has
been taken to a Kuantan hospital, Zulkiflee said, adding a board
of inquiry would be set up to investigate the incident.
