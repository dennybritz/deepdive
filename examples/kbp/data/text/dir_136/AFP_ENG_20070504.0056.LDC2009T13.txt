An eight-year-old Indonesian schoolboy died of internal injuries
after being severely beaten by four of his classmates, three of
them girls, a report said Friday.


The girls, aged eight, and a 10-year-old boy had been waiting for
their classmate after gym Saturday before attacking him in the
toilets, hitting him repeatedly in the chest and neck, the Kompas
newspaper said.


Later that day the boy complained of chest pain to his mother who
noticed bruises all over his body. He was kept away from school
after suffering from fever, but died on his way to hospital early
Thursday, the newspaper said.


"Edo said he was beaten and mobbed by his friends. He said his
waist was kicked and after he fell down they kept beating him and
stomped on his neck," Theresia Lily Sopiah said of her son,
blaming his death on the attack.


The newspaper said it was unclear what had prompted the assault.


Police were expected to investigate the incident and were
awaiting the results of an autopsy on the boy, the report said.


The incident comes after a nine-year-old boy died after three
teenage friends wrestled him at school last October. The friends
had been mimicking wrestling matches they had seen on television.


Several schools have since banned students from wrestling,
threatening them with sanctions ranging from calling their
parents to expulsion.
