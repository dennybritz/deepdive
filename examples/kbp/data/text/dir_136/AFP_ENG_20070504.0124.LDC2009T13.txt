The UN agency for refugees began repatriating thousands of
Congolese refugees in Zambia to the Democratic Republic of Congo
on Friday.


The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
more than 400 refugees had been bussed from a refugee camp in
northern Zambia to Lake Tanganyika, where they will be
transported by ship to the DRC.


"We have so far moved 414 from the camps. They will be
repatriated to Congo today (Friday)," said Kelvin Shimo, UNHCR
spokesman in Zambia.


The returnees were being taken to Kalemi, a small town in the
DRC, where most of them come from, Shimo told AFP.


He said the UN plans to repatriate at least 20,000 refugees who
have voluntarily registered to go home following last year's
elections.


Initially, the exercise had stalled due to lack of funds.


Zambia shelters more than 60,000 Congolese refugees with the
majority living at Mwange camp in northern Zambia near the border
with DRC.
