German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has invited the
initiators of an Arab Middle East peace plan to join a meeting of
European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on May 14 for talks.


He extended the invitation Friday to foreign ministers from Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Qatar as well as Arab League
chief Amr Mussa on the sidelines of an international conference
on Iraq here, a source with the German delegation said.


Germany currently holds the rotating EU presidency.


At a March summit in Riyadh, Arab leaders revived a five-year-old
peace plan that offers Israel normal relations if it withdraws
from all land seized in the 1967 Middle East war, and allows for
the creation of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian
refugees.


The EU has seized on the initiative as a potential way out of the
seemingly intractable conflict.


Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib warned the meeting
of Arab ministers and EU representatives that there was now
momentum in the peace process "that we cannot afford to lose,"
the source said.


Members of the international quartet for Middle East peace,
comprised of the EU, the United Nations, the United States and
Russia, were to meet with the Arab foreign ministers here later
Friday.
