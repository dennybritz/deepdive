At least 11 people have died following heavy rains and flash
floods in Sri Lanka's capital and nearby coastal areas, police
and hospitals said Friday.


The number of people killed in the capital on Thursday rose to
three, all of whom drowned after falling into unprotected drains
or manholes, a spokeswoman for the Colombo National Hospital
said.


Rains in neighbouring Gampaha and Kalutara districts and the
southern port district of Galle claimed a further nine lives on
Thursday, police said.


Sri Lanka depends on monsoon rains for irrigation and power
generation but the seasonal downpours frequently cause loss of
life and damage to property in low- lying areas.


The island's two main monsoon seasons run from May to September
and December to February.
