Nations must get greehouse gases to start declining by 2015 to
avoid the most destructive effects of climate change, UN experts
said in a new set of global warming recommendations on Friday.


Their report came after a week of marathon negotiations as
countries haggled over recommendations on how to tackle global
warming, which saw China lead efforts to blame rich nations for
the crisis.


The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN's leading
authority on the subject, said greenhouse gas emissions should
peak in 2015 and then fall by 50 to 85 percent below 2000 levels.


That would limit global warming to 2.0-2.4 degrees Celsius
(3.6-4.3 degrees Fahrenheit), generally recognised by experts as
the threshold at which some of the most extreme impacts of
climate change will begin.
