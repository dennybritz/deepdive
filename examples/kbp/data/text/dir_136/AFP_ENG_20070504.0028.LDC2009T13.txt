Australia's worst drought in memory has had many weird side-
effects -- but a nude carwash has to be one of the oddest.


The "big dry" has driven snakes into towns in search of water and
sent thirst- crazed wild camels rampaging through outback camps.


In Brisbane, capital of the "Sunshine State" of Queensland on the
east coast, it led to water restrictions, including a ban on
residents washing their own cars.


The result was a boom in professional carwash services, a
phenomenon which caught the eye of strip club entrepreneur Warren
Armstrong.


He set up "Bubbles 'n Babes", where customers can have their cars
washed by a topless woman for 55 dollars (45 US), or a nude woman
for 100 dollars.


Armstrong told the City News newspaper this week the operation
was above board.


"I'm just trying to make an honest dollar -- simple as that," he
said.


Police said no complaints had been received and, as the washing
took place out of public view, no criminal offence was being
committed.


Acting State Premier Anna Bligh said the operation was running on
recycled water and therefore did not break water restrictions --
but neither she nor the government fleet would be using it.


"It seems to me a pretty weird and wacky way to get your car
washed," she said.
