The Philippines has ordered the repatriation of 45 Filipino
construction workers from Nigeria after eight were kidnapped, the
foreign department said Friday.


The Filipino embassy has taken the workers to a hotel after armed
kidnappers attacked their construction site, Foreign
Undersecretary Esteban Conejos said.


He said the government had ordered their immediate return to the
Philippines, adding, "we are working on that now."


Three South Korean executives and eight Filipino labourers
working for the South Korean firm Daewoo Engineering and
Construction were seized Thursday in Nigeria.


The South Korean foreign ministry said Friday authorities in
Nigeria had met the kidnappers but said the meeting had produced
no results.


Some 4,500 Filipinos work in Nigeria, and Conejos said Manila
would also repatriate those who felt in danger, although he said
the security problem was focused on gas and oil areas.


The Philippines imposed a ban on Filipinos seeking jobs to
Nigeria earlier this year after 25 workers were abducted in
separate incidents. All the hostages were later freed unharmed.


President Gloria Arroyo eased the ban in March, allowing workers
with unfinished contracts to return to Nigeria.


About eight million Filipinos, or almost 10 percent of the
population, work abroad and their remittances are a major pillar
of the country's economy.
