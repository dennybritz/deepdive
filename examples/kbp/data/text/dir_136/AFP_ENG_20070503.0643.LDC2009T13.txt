A New Zealand cabinet minister and at least another nine
legislators were involved in a mid-air emergency late Thursday
after smoke was detected in their aircraft.


The Air New Zealand Boeing 737 flying from the capital Wellington
to Auckland made an emergency landing at an air force base after
the smoke was detected.


"There was certainly a little smoke in the air. It was
perceptible at the front of the passenger cabin and I imagine
more than that in the cockpit," said Communications Minister
David Cunliffe, one of the plane's passengers.


"People were cool, calm and collected but there was the odd
nervous joke," Cunliffe told Radio New Zealand.


The aircraft landed at the Ohakea air force base north of
Wellington on its second attempt after the crew double-checked
the landing gear was working properly.


Most of the 122 passengers were taken to Auckland on a
replacement aircraft early Friday morning.
