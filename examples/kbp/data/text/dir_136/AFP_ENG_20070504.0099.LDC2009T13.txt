Five Iraqi policemen were killed Friday when a bomb detonated as
they patrolled a Baghdad neighbourhood located on the frontline
of the city's sectarian war, defence and security sources said.


Two more policemen were wounded when the blast tore through their
vehicle in the southwest Amil neighbourhood that has been the
scene of frequent clashes between Sunni and Shiite gunmen, they
said.


A massive joint US-Iraq security operation has put more than
80,000 troops on the streets of Baghdad in an effort to quell the
violence but attacks, especially insurgent bombings, continue.
