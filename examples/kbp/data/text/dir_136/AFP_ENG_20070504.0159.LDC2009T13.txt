A Nigerian journalist was beaten unconscious by policemen on May
1st in southern state of Ondo and is still in coma, Reporters
Without Borders (RSF) said in a statement.


Dare Folorunso of the state-owned radiotelevision station,
according to RSF was beaten unconscious by several policemen,
"including a deputy commissioner", at a May 1 workers rally in
the capital city of Akure.


"The election campaign has created a very difficult climate for
press freedom. There have been many physical attacks on
journalists and they are getting more and more violent", RSF
said, calling on the Nigerian authorities to ensure that the
attackers are punished.


Opposition parties and civil rights groups had scheduled a mass
protest for the workers day to protest the country's April polls
slammed by local and international monitors as characterised by
violence, disorderliness and rigging.


According to the RSF account, released on Thursday, a policeman
had objected to Folorunso taking photos at the workers rally
despite identifying himself as a journalist.


The policeman thereafter tried to grab his camera but Folorunso
defended himself thus incurring the wrath of other policemen who
joined to beat the journalist, RSF said.


Witnesses said assistant commissioner of police Joshua Mumbo
participated in the beating and hit Folorunso several times on
the head with a baton, while other journalists were beaten when
they tried to intervene on behalf of Folorunso, RSF said.
