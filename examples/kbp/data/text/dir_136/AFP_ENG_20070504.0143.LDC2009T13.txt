The convicted terrorist Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos the
Jackal, is to stand trial for a series of attacks in the early
1980s in France that left 11 people dead, sources close to the
case said Friday.


The Marxist-Leninist radical is already serving a life sentence
in a French jail for the murder in 1975 of two French police
officers.


The latest charges against Carlos are that he was "complicit in
killings and destruction of property using explosive substances"
in relation to a series of bombings in France in 1982 and 1983
that killed 11 and injured more than 100 people, the sources
said.
