The British news and financial information group Reuters on
Friday said it has received a takeover approach but did not name
the suitor, sending the media giant's share price rocketing by
one quarter.


"The board of Reuters confirms it has received a preliminary
approach from a third party which may or may not lead to an offer
being made for Reuters," the group said in a statement.


"There is no certainty an offer will be made or necessary
approvals, including those required under Reuters constitution,
will be received."


In reaction to the news, Reuters shares surged about 25 percent
to 617.75 pence, while London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares
rose 0.55 percent to 6,573.80 points in late morning deals.


Reuters, which issued the release in response to recent share
price movements, added that a further announcement would be made
when appropriate.


The stock had rallied strongly earlier Friday amid vague takeover
talk that was sparked by News Corp.'s surprise five-billion-
dollar bid for the Dow Jones Co, which owns The Wall Street
Journal.
