EMI, the troubled British music publisher, said on Friday that
the company has received a number of takeover approaches, but did
not name the interested parties.


The Financial Times reported Friday that One Equity Partners,
which is affiliated to US investment bank JP Morgan Chase, wanted
to buy EMI for about 3.0 billion pounds (4.4 billion euros, 6.0
billion dollars).


"Further to recent speculation, EMI Group plc confirms that it
has received a number of preliminary indications of interest to
acquire the company," EMI said in a brief statement to the London
Stock Exchange.


"There can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be
made."


EMI, which has issued two profit warnings since the start of
2007, had in March rejected a 2.08-billion-pound approach from US
rival Warner Music Group, with which it has been in sporadic
takeover talks since 2000.
