US presidential candidate Barack Obama has been placed under
Secret Service protection, though officials declined to say
Thursday whether the unusual move was made in response to a
specific threat.


A team of government bodyguards was assigned to the Illinois
senator, who hopes to become the first African-American
president, after talks with a legislative advising committee, a
secret service spokesman said.


Homeland Security Secretary Michael "Chertoff has, after
consultations with the congressional advisory committee,
authorized United States Secret Service to protect presidential
candidate senator Barack Obama," said spokesman Darrin Blackford.


The security "has already begun," he added, but would not
elaborate on the reasons behind the move, which comes 18 months
before the November 2008 election.


"We are not confirming or denying that there are threats that
exist," Blackford said.


Prior to the 2004 presidential election, Democratic candidate
John Kerry and his vice-presidential sidekick John Edwards were
accorded a Secret Service detail in February, nine months before
voters went to the polls.


Obama, who was born to a white American mother and a Kenyan
father, is a frontrunner for the Democratic primary nomination
alongside New York Senator Hillary Clinton, wife of former
president Bill Clinton.


Clinton already has Secret Service protection because of her
status as former first lady of the United States.
