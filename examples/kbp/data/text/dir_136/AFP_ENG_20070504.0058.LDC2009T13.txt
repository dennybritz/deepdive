Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Friday that he had no
intention of resigning despite a mass rally that called on him to
step down over a scathing Lebanon war report.


"The prime minister does not intend to resign, these are
speculations," Olmert's spokeswoman Miri Eisin told AFP.


"The prime minister listens attentively to everything that
happens and is trying to react in the best interests of the state
of Israel," she said.


Late Thursday between 150,000 and 200,000 demonstrators,
according to police and organiser estimates, gathered in Tel
Aviv's Rabin Square calling on Olmert to quit after a government
inquiry blasted him for serious failure during last year's war
against Lebanon's Hezbollah.


It was the first mass demonstration calling for Olmert's ouster
since the report was published on Monday.


The beleaguered premier, weakened by months of criticism over the
war and a string of corruption scandals, has refused to resign
saying it would be irresponsible and has vowed to correct the
mistakes uncovered by the report.
