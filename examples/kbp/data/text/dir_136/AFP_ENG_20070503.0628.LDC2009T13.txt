Floyd Landis, who is fighting to keep his 2006 Tour de France
title after a positive drug test, has successfully lobbied to
have his upcoming arbitration hearing conducted in public.


Landis' spokesman Michael Henson told AFP on Thursday that this
will be the first time the US Anti-Doping Agency has agreed to
hold an athlete's hearing in public.


"Floyd wants it to be a transparent process," Henson said. "This
isn't going to be something that happens behind closed doors.


"In the past the anti-doping groups have done these things in
secret, and we want to let the public see how it unfolds.


"If they find Floyd guilty, and I don't believe they will, then
they better have a strong case and proceed in a fair and unbiased
manner."


He said Landis is expected to call between 12 and 15 witnesses
during the May 14 to 24 hearings at Pepperdine University in
Malibu, 25 miles east of Los Angeles.


Asked why they chose Pepperdine, Henson said "It is in California
and close to Floyd's home. We wanted a site that has a courtroom
and the Pepperdine law school has a suitable one."


The 31-year-old Landis, who lives in San Diego, is fighting to
keep his 2006 Tour de France title after the positive drug test.


Landis won the 2006 Tour de France largely thanks to an heroic
effort on stage 17 of the race.


However, he tested positive for an elevated level of testosterone
after that stage.


If found guilty, Landis could be stripped of his Tour de France
victory and given a two-year ban.


Landis also faces a French government probe, but that has been
delayed until after proceedings in the United States following
his promise not to race in France this year, which ended any
chance to defend his title.
