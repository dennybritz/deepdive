There is "substantial" potential for the world to reduce the
greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change to below
current levels, the UN's leading authority said in a report
approved on Friday.


"There is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of
global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades that
could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce
emissions below current levels," said the report, which was
obtained by AFP.


The text of the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change is scheduled to be released at 1:00 pm (0600 GMT).


A participant at the conference confirmed the text obtained by
AFP was the same as the one that was formally approved on Friday
morning.
