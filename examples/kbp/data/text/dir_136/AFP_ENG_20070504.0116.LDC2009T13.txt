Estonia is to open its first synagogue in the capital 63 years
after the last one was destroyed during World War II, Jewish
leaders said on Friday.


"Tallinn was the last European Union capital without a synagogue,
which is required for a fully functioning Jewish community,"
Shmuel Kot, chief Rabbi of Estonia, said in a statement.


"Thanks to kind contributors in Estonia and abroad, the building
that has been missing for the past 63 years has now been
completed."


The synagogue will be opened in Tallinn on May 16.


Tallinn's last functioning synagogue was destroyed in a Soviet
air raid in 1944.


Estonia's Jewish community currently numbers around 3,000 people,
down from 4,400 prior to World War II.
