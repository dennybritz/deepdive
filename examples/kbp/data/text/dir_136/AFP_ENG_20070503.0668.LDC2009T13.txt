Australia's worst drought in memory has had many weird side-
effects -- but a nude carwash has to be one of the oddest.


The "big dry" has driven snakes into towns in search of water and
sent thirst- crazed wild camels rampaging through outback camps.


In Brisbane, capital of the "Sunshine State" of Queensland on the
east coast, it led to water restrictions, including a ban on
residents washing their own cars.


The result was a boom in professional carwash services, a
phenomenon which caught the eye of strip club entrepreneur Warren
Armstrong.


He set up "Bubbles 'n Babes", where customers can have their cars
washed by a topless woman for 55 dollars (45 US), or a nude woman
for 100 dollars.


Armstrong told the City News newspaper this week the operation
was above board.


"I'm just trying to make an honest dollar -- simple as that," he
said.


Police said no complaints had been received and, as the washing
took place out of public view, no criminal offence was being
committed.
