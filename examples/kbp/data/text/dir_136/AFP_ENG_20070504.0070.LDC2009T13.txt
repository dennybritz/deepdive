Iraq's neighbours and key international players on Friday went
into talks aimed at increasing security cooperation and ending
the bloodshed in Iraq.


Taking part in the expanded neighbours' conference in the
Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh were Iran, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, the United States, European Union and United Nations, as
well as other key players.


"The meeting would focus on getting regional support to Iraq
specifically," a delegate told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"The idea is to create pressure for neighbours to perform."


On the first day of the conference Thursday, US Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice had rare encounters with old foes Syria
and Iran, marking a shift in Washington's long boycott of direct
contacts with the two nations.


The United States has repeatedly accused Iran and Syria of
fueling Iraq's spiralling communal conflict by funding and
abetting the Sunni Arab insurgency and hardline Shiite militias
respectively.


The two-day conference was expected to wrap up later Friday with
a commitment from Iraq's neighbours to help end the four-year-old
bloodshed.
