Britain's youngest municipal councillor was elected Friday when
an 18-year-old high school student won a seat on his local
authority.


The lowering of the minimum age limit from 21 to 18 meant William
Lloyd was able to stand for the Conservative Party in Brentwood,
30 miles (48 kilometres) east of London.


Lloyd, who is studying politics, history, geography and travel
and tourism at Brentwood County High School, defeated the sitting
Liberal Democrat councillor to win a place on Brentwood Borough
Council.


The teenager, who cites his political heroes as former British
prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill, is
hoping to combine his duties as a councillor with study for a
politics degree from September.


"Most councillors have full-time jobs and fulfil their duties at
the same time so I don't think it will be a problem," he said.


About 10,500 seats were contested for 312 English councils on
Thursday. Polls were also held for Scotland's 32 councils, plus
the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament.
