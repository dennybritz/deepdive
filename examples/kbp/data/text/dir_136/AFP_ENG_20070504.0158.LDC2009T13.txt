Iran on Friday accused the United States of terrorist acts in
Iraq, during an international meeting aimed at discussing
security cooperation in the war-torn country.


"To create a safe haven for those terrorists who try to turn
Iraqi territory into a base for attacking Iraq's neighbours
should be condemned," Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki
said at the conference.


A spokesman for the Iranian delegation at the two-day conference
on Iraq being held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
confirmed that Mottaki was referring to the United States.


"Mr Mottaki was referring to countries which, like the United
States, carry out acts of terrorism in Iraq," he told AFP.


"When the United States arrests five Iranian diplomats in Iraq,
it is an act of terrorism," he said on condition of anonymity.
