Efforts to stabilise the level of greenhouse gases over the next
20 to 30 years will be crucial in the fight against global
warming, the UN's leading authority said in a report approved on
Friday.


"Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have
a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation
levels" of greenhouse gases, the report said.


The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also
said there was "substantial" potential for the world to reduce
the greenhouse gas emissions to below current levels.


Greenhouse gases fuel global warming by trapping heat from the
sun.


"There is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of
global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades that
could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce
emissions below current levels," said the report, which was
obtained by AFP.


The report is set to be formally launched at a press conference
at 0600 GMT, and was agreed after five days of intense debate and
marathon talks by scientists and other leading climate experts at
a crucial UN conference here.


A participant at the conference confirmed the text obtained by
AFP was the same as the one that was formally approved on Friday
morning.
