Efforts to stabilise the level of greenhouse gases over the next
20 to 30 years will be crucial in the fight against global
warming, climate change experts said in a major new UN report
obtained by AFP Friday.


"Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have
a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation
levels" of greenhouse gases, the report said.


The report, which is set to be launched at a press conference at
0600 GMT, was agreed after five days of intense debate and
marathon talks by scientists and other leading climate experts at
a crucial UN conference here.
