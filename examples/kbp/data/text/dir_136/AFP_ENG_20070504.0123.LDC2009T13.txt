Southeast Asian states and the European Union agreed Friday to
launch free trade negotiations, setting aside differences over
alleged human rights violations in army-ruled Myanmar, an
official said.


EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson reached the agreement with
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic ministers
during a meeting in Brunei, ASEAN Secretary General Ong Keng Yong
told AFP.


"Yes, we agreed to launch the ASEAN-EU free trade negotiations,"
Ong said from the Brunei capital Bandar Seri Begawan.


"We will set up a joint working committee to follow through this
announcement ... The understanding is that we are talking to the
EU as a group of 10 member countries and Myanmar is a member of
ASEAN."
