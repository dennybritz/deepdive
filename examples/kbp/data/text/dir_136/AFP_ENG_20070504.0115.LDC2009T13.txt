The Swedish central bank decided on Friday to keep its key
interest rate unchanged at 3.25 percent, but signalled more rate
hikes are ahead.


"The Executive Board of the Riksbank decided to keep the repo
rate unchanged at 3.25 percent," the central bank said in a
statement.


"The assessment made at the same time was that the repo rate
needs to be raised gradually and more in the future than was
forecast in February, in order for inflation to develop in line
with the target and to attain a balanced development in the real
economy," it said.


In February the central bank, the Riksbank, had announced its
seventh interest rate rise in a row to choke the risk of
inflation in the economy which is growing robustly.


The bank, Riksbank, aims to hold underlying inflation below 2.0
percent.


"Compared with the assessment made in February, growth looks to
be slightly lower in the United States, but slightly stronger in
the euro area. In Sweden, the recently presented fiscal policy
proposals may increase production and demand in the Swedish
economy further," the bank statement said.


"All in all, inflationary pressures are now expected to be
slightly higher than was forecast in February."
