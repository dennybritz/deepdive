At least three people were killed in fresh clashes between troops
and Tamil Tiger rebels in northern Sri Lanka, the guerrillas said
Friday.


The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said they beat
back an attack by around 300 Sri Lankan army troops along their
frontline in the Wanni late Thursday and killed two soldiers.


LTTE spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said the rebels lost one
fighter during the clash.


The military claimed it killed 10 Tiger rebels in the same area
the day before.


The rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland for Sri
Lanka's minority Tamil community since 1972. The conflict has
claimed an estimated 60,000 lives.
