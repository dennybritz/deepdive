Russia's FSB spy agency is to deploy a radar system to guard
against illegal fishing off far eastern Russia, the official
Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily said on Friday.


The budget for the new anti-poaching drive is 14.7 million
dollars (10.8 million euros) and will go towards upgrading
radars, as well as purchasing new boats, Vladimir Lakizo, a local
FSB official was quoted as saying.


Patrols using new boats that can operate in stormy weather have
already begun along the Ussuri river and Russian territorial
waters of Primorye province, Rossiiskaya Gazeta said.


The FSB, formerly known as the KGB, controls Russia's border
guard service and has failed to halt rampant corruption and
organized crime in the Russian fishing industry.
