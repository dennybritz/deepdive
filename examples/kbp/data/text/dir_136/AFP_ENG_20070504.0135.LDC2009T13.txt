Retailers in the 13 countries sharing the euro saw stronger sales
in March despite a weaker trend in the bloc's biggest member
Germany, official EU data showed Friday.


The volume of retail trade in the eurozone grew 0.5 percent in
March from February and 2.6 percent over 12 months, the European
Union's Eurostat data agency said.


That marked an improvement from February when retailers saw their
sales grow only 0.4 percent over one month and 1.2 percent over
one year.


The improvement came despite a 0.7 percent fall in German sales
both over one month and one year as consumers in Europe's biggest
economy struggled to get used to higher value added tax after a
three percentage point rise in January.


Meanwhile, retail sales in the 27-nation EU also improved in
March, growing 0.6 percent over one month and 3.8 percent over
one year.
