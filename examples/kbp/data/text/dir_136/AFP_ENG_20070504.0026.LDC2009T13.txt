A Garuda Indonesia plane carrying hundreds of passengers returned
to the city of Surabaya shortly after takeoff when the pilot
heard a "buzzing noise" a report said Friday.


The national carrier's plane was 15 minutes into the flight to
Singapore when the pilot decided to turn around, a company
official said.


"The pilot decided to return back as the buzzing noise disrupted
his concentration," said Sudjoko Dalijo, a Garuda manager in
Surabaya, quoted by state Antara news service.


The decision was a precaution, the official added, and the Boeing
737-400, carrying 245 passengers, landed safely with no one
injured.


The incident comes after a series of air accidents in Indonesia
in recent months. A Garuda plane crashed into a runway in Central
Java in March, bursting into flames and killing 21 people.


Another plane belonging to the carrier landed safely on Sulawesi
island despite bursting a tyre last month.


An Adam Air plane plunged into the sea off Sulawesi island on New
Year's Day, killing all 102 on board.


The government says it is trying to improve passenger protection
in the archipelago nation of 17,000 islands, which depends on air
and sea links.


The accidents have been blamed on old planes and ships, poor
maintenance and insufficient investment in infrastructure despite
booming passenger numbers.
