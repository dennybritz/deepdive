Right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy has increased his lead in the race
against socialist Segolene Royal to become French president since
this week's head-to- head television debate, new polls showed
Friday.


The Ipsos/Dell poll showed Sarkozy winning Sunday's final-round
vote with 54 percent of the vote, a gain of half a percentage
point from his position before the debate on Wednesday evening.


Royal dropped half a point to 46 percent.


The survey of 1,414 registered voters conducted Thursday had a
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.


Earlier a CSA-Cisco poll, the first conducted and released after
the debate, put Sarkozy on 53 percent, up one percentage point,
and Royal on 47 percent, down one percentage point.


Wednesday's debate was watched by more than 20 million viewers,
and was seen as being decisive in winning over the nearly seven
million voters who had backed centrist Francois Bayrou in the
first round on April 22.


The Ipsos/Dell poll found Bayrou supporters were splitting
equally between Sarkozy and Royal.
