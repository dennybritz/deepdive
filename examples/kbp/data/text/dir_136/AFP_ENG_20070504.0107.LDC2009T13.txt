England captain Michael Vaughan is likely to miss at least the
first Test against West Indies starting May 17 after suffering a
broken finger playing for Yorkshire against Hampshire.


Vaughan, who has missed his country's previous 15 Test matches
due to a catalogue of other injuries, suffered an undisplaced
fracture of his right middle finger after being struck by a
delivery from Hampshire's Australian seamer Stuart Clark on
Thursday.


The injury is likely to keep Vaughan out for three to four weeks,
making him a near-certainty to miss out for the first Test at
Lord's and also for the second Test on his home Headingley ground
starting on May 25.


Yorkshire physio Scott McAllister told the Yorkshire Post: "My
first reaction was that it wasn't a serious problem, but results
from the hospital show that he has suffered a fractured finger.


"It's desperately bad luck for Michael after the succession of
problems he's had to contend with, and we will be monitoring his
progress over the next few days.


"It looks like he might be out for three to four weeks, but it's
too early to say with absolute certainty how long he will be out
for."


Vaughan recovered from a hamstring problem in time to play for
England in their disappointing World Cup campaign where he once
again failed to convince as a one-day batsman. Prior to that he
was sidelined by a string of career- threatening knee injuries.
