Two suspected members of a Muslim separatist group have been
arrested with bomb- making equipment in the southern Philippines,
officials said Friday.


Police raided the hideout of Thaos Alimpain and Nasser Mindu in
Midsayap town on the island of Mindanao on Thursday, seizing an
artillery shell, bomb components, two mobile phones, two firearms
and documents on how to assemble bombs, said Lieutenant Colonel
Julieto Ando.


The two men are suspected members of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), a Muslim separatist group that signed a ceasefire
with the government in 2003 to pave the way for peace talks.


MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu said that the rebel group was
investigating the report.


"If the two men are really involved in terrorism then they should
be punished severely. We do not harbor terrorists or criminals,"
Kabalu said.


The MILF has denied it is linked with other Muslim groups that
engage in bombings or kidnappings but its peace talks with the
government have been stalled several times amid sporadic clashes
with security forces.


In March, MILF forces clashed with the military in Midsayap,
leaving at least 18 people dead.
