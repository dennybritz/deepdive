Russian 24-hour news channel Russia Today launched a new Arabic
service on Friday that will focus on Russia's relations with the
Middle East, the channel said in a statement.


The new service, called Rusiya al-Yaum, began broadcasting at
0300 GMT and has around 500 staff, including some 100 journalists
from Arabic-speaking countries, the statement said.


"We're going to inform our audience ... about what's life in
Russia like, about all the main events happening in Russia,"
Yevgeny Sidorov, editor-in-chief at Russia Today, was quoted as
saying.


"We hope all this will allow our audience to learn more about our
country and to present Russia's position on many important issues
to Arabic viewers all over the world," Sidorov said.


The executive estimated the potential audience at 300-350 million
people.


Russia, which is a member of the Middle East diplomatic quartet,
has revived Cold War-era ties and stepped up its diplomatic and
economic role in the Middle East under President Vladimir Putin.
