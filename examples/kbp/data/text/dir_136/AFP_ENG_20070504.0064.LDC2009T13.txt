Dozens of security guards wielding metal pipes clashed with
workers at the construction site of the main stadium for the
Beijing 2008 Olympics leaving at least four injured, state press
said Friday.


The clashes occurred late Thursday after workers were found
smoking in a no- smoking zone at the stadium known as the Bird's
Nest for its intricate design of interlaced steel beams, the
Beijing News said.


One migrant laborer from Sichuan province surnamed An said he
tried to help two other workers being kicked and beaten by up to
10 security guards, when he himself was jumped on and pummeled,
the report said.


Later more workers and guards joined the melee, it added.


Three workers were injured, including one seriously, while one
security guard was also sent to hospital, the report said.


The clash occurred during China's ongoing May 1 Labour Day
holiday, a seven-day vacation that was not extended to either the
security guards or the workers at the Olympic construction site.
