Australian share prices were likely to continue gaining in the
week ahead, after closing Friday in record territory, dealers
said.


"After a three-week period of consolidation around the 6,200
level the Australian share market has now broken higher and looks
to have further to go," chief economist at AMP Capital Investors
Shane Oliver said.


For the week ended May 4, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200, surged
153.3 points or 2.49 percent to close at an all-time record of
6,304.9.


Oliver said the market was supported by strong profit growth,
good news on interest rates after the central bank gave
indications any hike was on hold in the near term, ongoing
takeover activity and increased pension inflows.


"While there will be corrections along the way, it wouldn't be at
all surprising to see the ASX 200 reach the 7,000 level by year
end," he said.


Macquarie Asset Management private client advisor Joseph Youssef
said the market was boosted on Friday by the Reserve Bank of
Australia lowering its inflation outlook for 2007.


He said mergers and acquisitions was also driving the market
higher.


"I think there's a lot more merger and acquisition activity to
come," Youssef said.


The national budget, to be announced on Tuesday, is expected to
be the main focus of attention next week.
