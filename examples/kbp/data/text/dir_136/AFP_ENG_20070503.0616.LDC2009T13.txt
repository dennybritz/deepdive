US soldiers stumbled on a plot to turn a girls school in Iraq
into an "absolute death trap" by rigging it with explosives while
it was under construction, a US military spokesman said Thursday.


"It was truly just an incredibly ugly, dirty kind of vicious
killing that would have gone on here by Al-Qaeda," Major General
William Caldwell said in an interview with CNN.


Caldwell said US soldiers discovered the explosives this week
when they spotted detonating wire across the street from the
school and followed it to its source inside the building.


The general said it was "obviously a sophisticated premeditated
attempt to inflict just massive casualties on our most innocent
victims -- young children, girls in this case."


"We found artillery shells that were being literally built into
the ceiling. We found artillery shells again all hooked up with
wires being built into the floors.


"We found propane tanks, two very large propane tanks built into
the floors under the stair wells.


"Somebody had clearly taken and planned to take this school, a
place of learning for these young children and turn it into an
absolute death trap," he said.


Pentagon officials said they had no information about the plot.


CNN identified the school as the Huda Girls School, which was
under construction in the town of Tarmiya, north of Baghdad.
Caldwell said the school was in a predominantly Shiite area.


Caldwell said the Iraqi contractors who were building the school
were being investigated.
