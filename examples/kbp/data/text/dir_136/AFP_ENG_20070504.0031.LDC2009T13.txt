A US soldier was killed and two wounded south of Baghdad when
their patrol were hit by a road side bomb Friday, the US military
reported.


The latest casualty brings the number of US servicemen to die in
Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,356 according to an AFP
count based on Pentagon figures.
