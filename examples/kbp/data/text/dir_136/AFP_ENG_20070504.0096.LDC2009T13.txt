Tribes in New Caledonia are living in the middle of asbestos rock
deposits which are dangerous to their health, a study has found,
in the archipelago where the cancer rate is unusually high.


Mariann Houchot, from the University of New Caledonia, studied
several tribes from the Hienghene valley in the north of New
Caledonia island as part of a global survey to identify areas
where asbestos is concentrated.


"This study highlights how the population has been exposed to
asbestos," said Houchot, who released her results this week.


Photographs show children playing in rock dust, the most
dangerous form of asbestos, close to bulldozers which were
clearing the rock, releasing large numbers of fibres into the
air.


According to the Pasteur Institute, the number of mesotheliomas
-- a cancer caused by inhaling asbestos fibres -- is 30 times
higher in New Caledonia than in France, while the rate of lung
cancer is also significantly higher.
