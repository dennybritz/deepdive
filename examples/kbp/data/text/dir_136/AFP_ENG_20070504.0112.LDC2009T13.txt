Pro-Kremlin activists have ended a protest outside the Estonian
embassy in Moscow aimed against that country's decision to move a
Soviet war memorial, officials said on Friday.


"They ended the protest during the night," said the guard, as a
cleaner washed graffiti off the walls of the consulate in central
Moscow and several police cars stood nearby.


The consulate, which had been closed down due to security fears
during the week- long protests, was also re-opened on Friday, a
spokesman for the embassy said.


"Our consular section was opened this morning and is working as
previously. But we continue to observe the situation around the
embassy and will react accordingly," Franek Persidski said.


Dozens of activists from Nashi, a pro-Kremlin youth group, and
Young Guard, part of the ruling United Russia party, had kept up
round-the-clock protests outside the embassy and consulate since
last Friday.


The activists had stopped traffic in and out of the embassy,
waving flags and shouting slogans against fascism. The protests,
which were permitted by Russian authorities, brought condemnation
from Estonia.


Estonia moved a World War II monument from central Tallinn to a
military cemetery, sparking furious reactions from Russian
officials, who have called on the European Union and NATO to
reprimand Estonia.
