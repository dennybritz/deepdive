Malaysia's conservative northern Kelantan state is to deploy
"ghostbusters" to perform exorcisms on followers of illicit
Islamic cults, reports said Friday.


Kelantan's Islamic Affairs Department director, Abdul Aziz Abdul
Rahman, said the exorcists were well-versed in the Koran and
would drive out evil spirits from cult followers who follow
"deviant" teachings, the Star reported.


The exorcists will also tackle Islamic enforcement officers who
had investigated cultists and been converted, it said.


"Perhaps meals or drinks served to the officers were spiked ...
Otherwise, it does not make sense how a person with strong faith
can be easily overcome by deviant teachings," Abdul Aziz was
quoted as saying.


"This is where exorcism may be needed to flush out the unhealthy
elements through spiritual Islamic teachings," he said.


Mainly Muslim Malaysia is always on the lookout for Islamic cults
it says deviate from traditional teachings and practice.


Abdul Aziz said authorities had identified 16 cults in the state
in the past decade and had jailed, whipped or fined members found
guilty of spreading irregular teachings.


"It's not easy to catch these deviationists as they use all kinds
of tactics to hide their activities which include black magic,"
he was quoted as saying by the state Bernama news agency.
