An English municipal councillor held on to his seat after the
election was decided by the toss of a coin, the BBC reported
Friday.


Christopher Underwood-Frost tied with Liberal Democrat John
Birkenshaw after each polled 781 votes for the Scotter ward of
West Lindsey district in Lincolnshire, eastern England.


Despite winning, the Conservative Party candidate said he did not
think an election should be decided on the toss of a coin.


"We did ask whether we between ourselves could agree to disagree
with the toss of a coin... but the law's the law, and the law
needs to be changed in my view," he was quoted as saying.


"Here I am re-selected by a way that I don't think anybody would
agree with, but that's the law."


About 10,500 seats were contested for 312 English councils on
Thursday. Polls were also held for Scotland's 32 councils, plus
the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament.
