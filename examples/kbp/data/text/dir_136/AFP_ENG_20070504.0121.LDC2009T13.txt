The British news and financial information group Reuters on
Friday said it has received a takeover approach but did not name
the suitor.


"The board of Reuters confirms it has received a preliminary
approach from a third party which may or may not lead to an offer
being made for Reuters," the group said in a short statement,
adding there was no certainty that an offer would be made.
