The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Thursday it will
investigate violent clashes that marred a Los Angeles march
backing immigration reform this week.


A preliminary probe "will parallel investigations already under
way" by the Los Angeles Police Department "into whether the civil
rights of participants in the May 1st immigration rally were
violated," the FBI said in a statement.


The results of the inquiry would be forwarded to the Justice
Department, which would decide whether to launch a full
investigation, the FBI said.


Tuesday, television images showed baton-wielding police in riot
gear clubbing journalists and firing rubber bullets after
scuffles broke out following a day- long rally involving several
thousand protesters.


About 10 demonstrators suffered minor injuries, Los Angeles Fire
Department officials told local media, while police said 15
officers were hurt.


Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton said afterward he wanted
an open inquiry into the violence and hinted that police may have
overreacted.


The clashes began after some protesters threw plastic bottles and
rocks at police, The Los Angeles Times reported, quoting
witnesses.
