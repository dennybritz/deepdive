Service sector activity in the 13 nations sharing the euro slowed
in April while remaining at a high level, according to a survey
published on Friday.


The eurozone purchasing managers index (PMI) for the service
sector, compiled by the research group NTC Economics, slipped to
57.0 points in April from 57.4 in March.


Private economists had forecast an increase marginally to 57.5
points.


Despite the lower level of activity, the vast service sector
continued to show resilience with the forty-sixth consecutive
month of growth, as indicated by a figure over 50 points.


Economists said that survey's findings remained consistent with
strong economic growth in the eurozone despite the slowdown in
the sector.


Unicredit economist Marco Kramer said that the April survey "was
a small disappointment at the start of the second quarter."


"However, sentiment in the service sector remains at elevated
levels and is still pointing to ongoing strong domestic demand in
the eurozone," he added.


Global Insight economist Howard Archer said: "Eurozone service
sector activity is still at a relatively elevated level by long-
term norms, with new business, outstanding business and
employment holding up well."


"Furthermore, business expectations improved fairly markedly in
April," he added.
