French champions Lyon will seek to recruit three top-level
players in the off- season, president Jean-Michel Aulas said
Friday, confirming that Gerard Houllier would continue to coach
the club.


"There could be seven to eight players leaving," Aulas said. "For
the moment only Eric Abidal has come to see me with the aim of
leaving.


"Otherwise, Gerard Houllier has asked me for three 'big names'
and we're working on that. If he's asking that, it's for no other
coach than him," Aulas told the Le Progres newspaper.
