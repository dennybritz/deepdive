German travel company TUI and British rival First Choice, which
are combining to create a global tourism giant, said Friday that
they would sell their Irish assets to win European approval.


TUI and First Choice had agreed to a mega-merger in March to
create a leading global operator with estimated revenues of 12.1
billion pounds (17.6 billion euros, 23.4 billion dollars).


In a statement on Friday, the two firms said that the European
Commission's competition case team had raised concerns in a
meeting on Thursday over the "issue of potential dominance post-
merger in the Republic of Ireland."


Both TUI and First Choice have "agreed to consider specific
undertakings to address this issue including the potential sale
of one of their Irish businesses," the statement said.


As a result, the decision on whether to clear the proposed merger
was now expected "on or before" June 4, 2007.


"First Choice and TUI AG remain confident that the proposed
merger will be cleared by the European Commission," they added.


TUI will own 51 percent of the new company, to be based in
Britain and called TUI Travel.


The groups have said that the merger will create a leading
worldwide travel group with around 27 million customers per year
and over 200 destinations across the globe.


The merger marked further consolidation of the European tourism
industry, with the announcement coming after package holiday
specialists Thomas Cook and MyTravel confirmed they were to carry
out their own German-British tie-up.
