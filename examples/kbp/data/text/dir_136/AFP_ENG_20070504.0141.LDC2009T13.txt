Hernan Crespo is hoping to stay on loan at recently-crowned Serie
A champions Inter Milan rather than return to Chelsea to serve
the final year of his contract with the English Premiership club.


The 31-year-old Argentine striker, who won the league title with
Chelsea in the 2005-06 season, joined Inter on a two-season loan
last summer but Chelsea have the option to call him back at the
end of this month if they so wish.


"If by May 31 they don't exercise their right to bring me back to
London, the loan will be automatically extended for another
year," Crespo was quoted as saying in Friday's Gazzetta dello
Sport.


"I would like to finish my career here. I know that Chelsea would
like me back, but I hope I don't have to leave Milan."


Crespo is in his second spell with Inter having also played for
the club in the 2002-03 season.


The Argentina international has also played for Serie A sides
Parma, Lazio and AC Milan.
