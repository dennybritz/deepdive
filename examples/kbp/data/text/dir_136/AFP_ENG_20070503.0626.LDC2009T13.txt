Sacramento Kings star Ron Artest was sentenced to 20 days in
jail, 100 days of community service and anger management classes
Thursday after pleading "no contest" to a domestic violence
charge.


The Sacramento Bee newspaper reported that Artest would likely
avoid further jail time, however.


Placer County Superior Court judge Frances Kearney stayed 10 days
of the jail term, and Artest can apply to serve the remainder in
a work release or other alternative programme. In addition,
Artest was credited with one day served at the time of his
arrest.


The misdemeanor domestic violence charge stemmed from a March 5
incident involving Artest and his wife, Kimsha.


Under the plea agreement, Artest entered a no-contest plea to one
misdemeanor count of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse,
while three other related charges were dismissed.


The arrest marked yet another ugly incident involving Artest.


While playing for the Indiana Pacers, Artest was at the centre of
a 2004 melee during an NBA game in suburban Detroit and suspended
for 75 games, the longest non-drug ban in NBA history.


After a scuffle on the court with Detroit Pistons center Ben
Wallace, Artest was hit with a partially full plastic cup thrown
from the stands and he raced into the seating area, attacking a
fan he believed threw the cup.


The incident triggered a brawl between players and fans and led
to changes in security measures at all NBA arenas. Artest later
faced criminal charges but was sentenced to probation and
community service.
