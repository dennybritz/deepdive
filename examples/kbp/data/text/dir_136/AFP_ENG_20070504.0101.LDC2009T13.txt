Bangladesh's state of emergency has created a climate that is
promoting self- censorship and harassment of journalists, the US
envoy to Dhaka said in a statement Friday.


"The current state of emergency in Bangladesh has introduced
ambiguity and uncertainty as journalists seek to navigate the
informal controls on media freedom," ambassador Patricia Butenis
said.


"It is not surprising that some journalists and editors practise
self-censorship and... journalists who are perceived to be overly
aggressive or politically partisan have received unwanted
attention from certain persons in positions of authority," she
said.


"Harassment, threats or abuse of journalists, from any quarter,
whatever the motive, are wrong," she added.


The country has been under emergency rule since January 12 when a
military- backed interim government took power following months
of violent protests. Elections scheduled for that month were also
cancelled.


A new interim government, which is seen as being army-backed, has
pledged to hold rescheduled elections by the end of 2008 after it
has cleaned up Bangladesh's notoriously corrupt political system.


Although restrictions on political activity have been imposed,
the government asserted in January that "no restrictions have
been imposed on the media's freedom and functions."
