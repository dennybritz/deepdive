The Taliban said Friday it had not been contacted about its
demands for the release of a Frenchman and three Afghans it has
held for a month, reiterating its position on foreign hostages
was "clear."


The deadline for its demands -- the withdrawal of French troops
or release of Taliban prisoners -- is due to expire on Saturday.
No precise time has been given.


"The deadline is drawing closer every moment," Taliban spokesman
Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP.


"The French government and the Afghan government not only has not
accepted our demands, but they even have not tried to contact us.
The situation is unclear and blurry."


The spokesman for the extremists said their council of leaders
would decide what to do should the demands not be met.


Asked last Saturday if this could include killing them, Ahmadi
said: "The policy of the Taliban movement regarding the foreign
hostages is clear: if our demands are not met, we will act based
on our policy that we have implemented with foreigners so far."


Taliban militants have beheaded several Afghan hostages whom they
have accused of spying; they have also executed several Turks and
Indians.


The only killing of a Westerner they have claimed responsibility
for was that of a British engineer in 2005.


The movement threatened last month to kill an Italian hostage,
who was eventually released in exchange for five Tailban
prisoners. His Afghan driver and interpreter were beheaded.
