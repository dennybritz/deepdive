Two people were killed and 12 injured when flames broke out in a
village psychiatric hospital in Russia's southern Rostov region,
the local emergency ministry officials said early Friday.


"According to preliminary information, two people were killed and
12 injured" when the two-storey building in Taroganovka village
caught fire, an official quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency
said.


Firefighters arrived at the scene 12 minutes after the fire was
reported and extinguished the flames in two-and-a-half hours.


In December last year, a fire in a Moscow drug rehabilitation
clinic killed 45 women. Many of the victims were trapped by metal
bars on the windows that staff could not open and an emergency
exit was boarded up, officials said.


In March, a fire in a nursing home in southern Russia killed 63,
also due to violations of fire safety regulations and the lack of
a nearby firefighting station.
