The launch of a European heavy rocket to place two large
broadcasting satellites in orbit was delayed by 24 hours on
Thursday due to strong high-altitude winds, officials said.


The unfavourable weather for the 2229-2323 GMT launch window
"lead us to decide not to launch tonight. We'll try again
tomorrow (Friday) at the same time," said Jean-Yves Le Gall,
chairman and CEO of Arianespace, the launch operator.


The Ariane-5 ECA rocket is set to lift the 4.5 tonne Astra 1L,
providing high- definition TV over Europe for the Luxembourg-
based firm SES Astra, and the 4.1-tonne Galaxy 17, which will
provide TV and communications over North America for Intelsat.


The launch is be the 176th for Ariane and the 32nd involving an
Ariane 5.
