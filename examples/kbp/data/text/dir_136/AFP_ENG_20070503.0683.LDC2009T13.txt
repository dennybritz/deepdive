The signal of a government-run television station in southern
China was hijacked by alleged hackers who used the frequencies to
broadcast anti-government content, press reports said Friday.


The incident occurred on the evening of May 1, when the broadcast
of a popular singing contest on Guangzhou Satellite Cable
Television was blacked out for up to 90 minutes, the Southern
Metropolitan Daily reported.


During the blackout, anti-government images lasting up to 40
seconds appeared on television screens in Guangzhou, the
provincial capital of China's economically booming region of
Guangdong, the report said.


No details of the messages or the alleged hijackers was given.


Officials at the television station refused to comment on the
issue when contacted by phone by AFP, citing government
sensitivities over such actions.


Although the news report was taken off the Southern Metropolitan
Daily website as of Friday, the identical report appeared on
other government websites around the nation such as the Sichuan
provincial news website.


The incident was not the first time satellite signals from state-
owned television broadcasts have been jammed and replaced with
anti-government messages.


The banned spiritual group the Falungong earlier this decade
repeatedly hijacked state television satellite signals and
broadcast content attacking the ruling Communist Party.
