Hong Kong share prices closed 0.77 percent higher Friday led by
property stocks on hopes that a government land auction next week
will attract strong bids from major real estate developers and
help boost the sector, dealers said.


They said sentiment was generally positive following Wall
Street's record breaking run.


PetroChina surged after confirming a major oil find in the Jidong
Nanpu field in northeastern Bohai Bay.


Other China stocks also rose on expectations that mainland
bourses will post further gains after resuming trade next week
following the Labor Day holidays.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 159.50 points at 20,841.08, off a
high of 20,883.21 and a low of 20,714.82. For the week, the index
is up 314.58 points or 1.5 percent. Turnover was 63.96 billion
Hong Kong dollars (8.2 billion US).
