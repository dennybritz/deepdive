Organisers of the Louis Vuitton Cup have told Italian challenger
Mascalzone it must re-race its round robin encounter with Desafio
Espanol and also pay a 10,000-euro fine after the race jury found
the Italians had breached backstay mast usage rules.


Although the jury found the breach did not materially affect the
outcome of the race, which the Italians won Wednesday, Mascalzone
were nevertheless found in breach of Class Rule 44.1, compliance
whilst racing, which says backstays, topmast backstays and check
stays cannot be altered during a race.


Desafio protested after viewing a video of the encounter and the
jurors upheld their complaint.


The Italians admitted to resetting the backstays to avoid drag on
the final run- in to port but said the incident arose by mistake
and comprised neglecting to adhere to a recent rule change.


Both teams are hoping to make it to the semi-finals later this
month with the top four sides of 11 challengers going through.
The winners of those matches will then face off for the right to
meet defending champions Alinghi of Switzerland for the Americas
Cup.


Friday is set to see flights five and six of the second round of
round robin Louis Vuitton matches after storms washed out
Thursday action.
