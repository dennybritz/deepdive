AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi says he would gladly welcome
back Andriy Shevchenko if the Ukrainian striker ever decides he
wants to leave Chelsea.


Shevchenko left AC Milan to join Chelsea last summer in a 45
-million-euro move, but has so far struggled to cope with life in
the English Premiership, scoring just four league goals.


"Certainly for him the doors are not just ajar, they're wide
open," Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, was quoted
as saying by the Gazzetta dello Sport on Friday.


Shevchenko, 30, missed Tuesday's Champions League semi-final,
second leg against Liverpool due to a groin injury. Liverpool won
1-0 to make it 1-1 on aggregate, with the Merseysiders winning
the penalty shoot-out.


AC Milan will be Liverpool's opponents in the May 23 final, a
repeat of the 2005 final, after they beat Manchester United on
Wednesday.


European Footballer of the Year in 2004, Shevchenko is expected
to have surgery on his troublesome groin at the end of the
season.
