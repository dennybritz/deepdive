Armed raiders wearing police uniforms killed 10 people in western
Kenya, 10 days after six others were slain in the same region
which is dogged by violence over land disputes, police said
Friday.


Regional police chief Everett Wasige said the attackers, who
struck late Thursday, were suspected of belonging to Sabaot Land
Defence Forces, a tribal militia protesting a land allocation
scheme they say is unfair.


"We have been informed that a gang of individuals wearing police
uniforms raided Matisi village and shot people indiscriminately.
Police on the ground have told us 10 people have been killed,"
Wasige said.


He said police investigators had been deployed to the area, and
that Kenya's national police commissioner had offered a reward of
200,000 shillings (3,000 USD) to anyone offering information
leading to the arrest of the attackers.


Last September, the Sabaot intensified attacks against other
tribes in a land dispute in the Mount Elgon area near the Kenyan
border with Uganda.


Since then, sporadic clashess have spread to neighbouring
regions.


Land disputes are a common source of clashes in Kenya and the
government has been accused of favouring certain tribes in the
distribution of land.
