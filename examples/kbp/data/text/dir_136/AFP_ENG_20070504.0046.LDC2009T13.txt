A prominent and controversial adviser to Nepal's embattled King
Gyanendra has died, an official said Friday.


Satchit Shumshere Rana, the country's former army chief and a
tireless defender of the 238-year-old monarchy, died at a
military hospital early Friday, army spokesman Brigadier General
Ramindra Chhetri told AFP.


The 74-year-old was the head of the army during the 1990
democracy movement, when scores of people protesting against the
current King's brother were shot and killed.


He was also a key player in King Gyanendra's much-criticised
takeover in 2005, when the King assumed total rule after sacking
the government, accusing them of corruption and failing to tackle
the Maoist insurgency.


Rana was a member of the now-scrapped royal privy council, and
has been investigated for his role in the suppression of last
year's massive demonstrations that forced King Gyanendra to
restore parliament.


Since the climbdown last April, Gyanendra has been stripped of
most of his powers, including his position as head of the state
and his control of the army.


Nepal's Maoists, who have entered parliament and government after
signing a peace deal last November, have threatened to launch new
mass protests unless the monarchy is abolished.


The fate of the royals was supposed to be be decided in polls
scheduled for June, but Nepal's top election official has said
that ballots are not possible as more preparation time is needed.
