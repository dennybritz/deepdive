Six relatives of a congressional candidate were shot dead in the
Philippines early Friday in the deadliest attack so far in the
run-up to elections.


The attack happened in the troubled northern province of Abra
when political rivals opened fire with automatic weapons on the
convoy of Cecille Luna, mayor of Lagayan.


Luna, who is running for congress, said in a television interview
her van was ambushed shortly after she left it by men who thought
that she was still inside.


In an interview with ABS-CBN television, Luna said six cousins
and nephews in the van were killed.


She blamed the attack on a political rival, Abra Governor Vicente
Valera, who is running against her in the May 14 elections.


"No one would want to kill me but our governor," she said in the
interview.


Another Valera rival, Luis Bersamin and his bodyguard were gunned
down outside a church wedding in Manila before the campaign
started on December 16. Police are still investigating the
killings.


Several dozen people have been killed in the current campaign.
President Gloria Arroyo has deployed the army in certain areas to
prevent more killings.


Just hours before the Abra attack, a candidate for town council
was shot dead by communist insurgents in Daraga town, southeast
of Manila.
