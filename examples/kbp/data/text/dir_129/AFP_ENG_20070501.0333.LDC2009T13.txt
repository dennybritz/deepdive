Fashion fans lining up at shops around Britain Tuesday to snap up
items from supermodel Kate Moss's clothing range for Topshop
might have been better off looking online, where coveted items
were already on sale.


Although most of the high street chain's branches started selling
the range only on Tuesday, its flagship store in London's Oxford
Street opened Monday night to allow more than one thousand people
to grab an early slice of style.


With 45-pound (66-euro, 90-dollar) floral dresses now attracting
bids of up to 150 pounds on internet auction site eBay, it seems
that shoppers have either tired of their purchases already -- or
that the pre-sale was targeted by traders.


Even the free goodie bags which were handed out to those in the
queue, some of whom waited for up to eight hours, were being
auctioned online.


Topshop tried to crack down on people buying items simply in
order to sell them over the Internet by limiting to five the
number of pieces each shopper was allowed to buy.


While the huge crowds of Monday night's event in Oxford Street,
when Moss posed alongside mannequins in a shop window, were not
replicated Tuesday, there were still hundreds of people thronging
the store.


The much-hyped range, which Moss helped to design, features
pieces costing between 10 and 200 pounds and will also go on sale
at Barneys in the United States, Colette in Paris and Corso Como
in Milan, Italy.
