A NATO-led offensive in a restive southern Afghanistan district
killed up to 56 militants, including some Pakistani nationals, on
its first day, an Afghan commander told AFP Tuesday.


"We've killed up to 56 Taliban, including lots of Pakistanis,"
General Moheydin Ghori from the Afghan army told AFP by telephone
from the area.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) had
earlier said the operation, launched Monday in Helmand province's
Sangin Valley, had killed "a significant number of insurgents."
