Doctors in Britain have carried out an operation which is the
first attempt to cure a sight disorder using gene therapy, they
said Tuesday.


Medics at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London carried out the
procedure on 23 -year-old Robert Johnson, who was born with an
inherited disorder which stops his retina detecting light
properly.


His condition, which meant he could see only outlines of objects,
was getting worse with age, but now it is hoped his sight will
improve.


The operation saw surgeons injecting copies of the faulty RPE65
gene into the back of Johnson's eye, a procedure which required
pinpoint precision.


It was carried out following years of research involving the
hospital and the Institute of Opthalmology at University College
London.


"We have been developing gene therapy for eye disease for almost
15 years, but until now we have been evaluating the technology
only in the laboratory," said lead researcher Professor Robin
Ali.


"Testing it for the first time in patients is very important and
exciting and represents a huge step towards establishing gene
therapy for the treatment of many different eye conditions."


It is likely to be several months before full results of the
trial are available.
