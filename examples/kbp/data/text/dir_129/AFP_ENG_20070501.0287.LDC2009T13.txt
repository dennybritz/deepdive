Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa has agreed to hold talks with
his main critics, including opposition chief Michael Sata, in a
bid to take heat out of simmering political tensions, organisers
said Tuesday.


The June meeting, to be attended by all opposition leaders, will
be chaired by former supreme court judge Frederick Chomba who was
unanimously nominated by all parties, said a spokesman of the
Center for Inter-Party Dialogue.


"The summit of political parties will iron out the differences on
national matters," the spokesman Newton Ng'uni said.


The Center for Inter-Party Dialogue is an initiative by donor
agencies who have formalised direct talks among political actors
in an effort to avoid violence and narrow their differences.


Political tensions have been rising in Zambia over Mwanawasa's
reluctance to pass a new constitution that would reduce powers of
the president, grant greater rights to citizens and provide for
an independent judiciary.


"There is a lot of tension. We are disagreeing when we are not
supposed to and we are advancing certain options when we know
they are illegal," Mwanawasa said after he met organisers of the
meeting.


The Zambian leader has accused the opposition and civil society
groups of proposing illegal ways of changing the constitution.


Sata, the fiery leader of the main opposition Patriotic Front and
major critic of Mwanawasa, said he will attend the meeting
because it was the only way of resolving differences.


"I shall attend and meet him (Mwanawasa)," Sata said.
