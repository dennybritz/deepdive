Greek police said Tuesday they had called in a Belgian expert to
help investigate the disappearance a boy in the north of the
country, in a case that created headlines in the country for
months.


Belgian commissioner Alain Remue, head of the Belgian federal
police's Missing Persons bureau, was called in at the specific
request of the missing boy's mother, who has denounced the
handling of the case to date.


The boy, 11-year-old Alexander Meshisvili, went missing in the
northern village of Verria in February last year. His family is
of Georgian origin.


"The aim of this initiative is to sensitise and train police
personnel," said a police statement, adding that it was also
taken to satisfy the wishes of his family.


The authorities have also opened an investigation into
allegations of negligence by both the police and the judiciary
made by the mother.


This is just the latest development in a case that has caused a
media frenzy in Greece.


The body of Alexander has never been found, but last July two
Greek minors, two Albanians and a Romanian of similar age, were
charged with premeditated manslaughter of the boy.


Last Friday, police lodged perjury charges against the
grandfather and brother of the two Greek youths involved. The men
were also charged with aiding and abetting the crime by allegedly
hiding the body.
