Manchester City bad-boy Joey Barton has been suspended by his
club for the rest of the season after hospitalising a team-mate.


Barton clashed with Ousmane Dabo during a training ground
incident, leaving the Frenchman needing medical treatment to his
mouth.


Manchester City admitted a player had been suspended but refused
to confirm his identity.


However, Barton's agent Willie McKay told the BBC: "As far as
I've heard, he was defending himself. But because it is Joey it
makes headlines.


"It happens on training grounds all over the country, from
Chelsea to Yeovil."


McKay was also the agent responsible for bringing Dabo to the
Premiership. The 30-year-old former France international joined
from Italians Lazio in June 2006 on a three-year deal.


City said: "We can confirm that a player has been suspended
pending an internal investigation."


Barton, 24, is an outspoken character having recently blasted
some England team- mates, including Chelsea's Frank Lampard.


The midfielder has one England cap, having played against Spain
at Old Trafford in February.
