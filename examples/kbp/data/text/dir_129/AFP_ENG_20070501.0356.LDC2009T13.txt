Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza awarded government workers
a 34-percent pay rise as the small ,central African nation
celebrated Labour Day on Tuesday.


The increment was in line with economic growth the country
recorded in the past year, Nkurunziza said in a televised speech
late Monday.


He said the government collected 96 percent of tax revenues last
year compared to 88 percent in 2005, and international aid rose
to 128 million dollars from 40 million dollars during the same
period.


"We have therefore decided to award a 34-percent increase on
basic salaries of all public sector workers," Nkurunziza said in
the local Kirundi language.


Around 60,000 workers will receive the pay rise with the
exception of soldiers, police and magistrates who are not in the
same category as other government employees, and whose salaries
were tripled last year.


"We laud this remarkable effort, but it is not sufficient," said
Eulalie Nibizi, head of country's largest trade union.


The basic salary of a government worker ranges between 25 and 40
dollars (18 and 29 euros) per month.


"We ask the Labour Ministry to rapidly calculate the new salaries
so they can take effect by July," Nkurunziza said.


Burundi is slowly recovering from the aftermath of a 13-year-old
civil war that devastated its economy and killed around 300,000
people.


Around two-thirds of its population of 7.6 million live in
poverty.
