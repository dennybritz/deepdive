World number one Roger Federer and Spanish rival Rafael Nadal are
set to clash in an exhibition match with a difference on Wednesay
- facing off on a dual surface court.


Organisers said Tuesday they have already sold out the
6,800-capacity "Palma Arena" for the one-off best of three sets
match between the world's top two players.


At each change of ends they will have to change their shoes and
possibly even their rackets as one side of the court is grass and
the other clay for the 1.2 million euro exhibition match designed
to promote tourism on the island.


Nadal, who hails from Mallorca, is the undisputed king of clay
having won his 72nd straight match on the dirt on Sunday in
Barcelona. He also defeated Federer in the Monte Carlo Masters
final a week earlier as well as in the French Open final last
year.


On grass Federer holds the upper hand, having beaten the Spaniard
in the last Wimbledon final for a fourth straight win on the
surface.
