A coalition of Sunni insurgent groups led by Al-Qaeda's Iraq
branch denied on Tuesday that its leader, known by US officials
as Abu Ayyub al-Masri, had been killed, in an Internet statement.


"The Islamic State of Iraq reassures the ummah (Islamic nation)
on the safety of Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Muhajer, God keep him, and
he is still fighting God's enemies," the group said, using the
name it uses for its leader.
