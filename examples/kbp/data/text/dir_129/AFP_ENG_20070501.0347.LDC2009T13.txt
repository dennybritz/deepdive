Paul McCartney is in reflective mood on his new album "Memory
Almost Full," which he describes as an emotional look back at his
life with echoes of some of the songs he wrote for The Beatles.


"In places it's a very personal record and a lot of it is
retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a
kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone," McCartney said in a
statement on his website.


The album, which is due out on June 4 and follows his 2005 album
"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard," was partly recorded at
Abbey Road studios in London and was "evocative, emotional,
rocking," McCartney said.


"There is a medley of five songs towards the end and that was
purposefully retrospective," he said.


"I thought this might be because I'm at this point in my life,
but then I think about the times I was writing with John (Lennon)
and a lot of that was also looking back," he added.


"It's like me with 'Penny Lane' and 'Eleanor Rigby'," two hit
tracks from the 1967 album "Magical Mystery Tour" and 1966's
"Revolver" respectively.


"I'm still up to the same tricks!" he said.


McCartney, who turns 65 next month, has more recently courted
attention due to his high-profile split from former model Heather
Mills, with whom he has a three-year-old daughter.


McCartney and Mills appeared in court in London last month for a
preliminary hearing in their divorce proceedings.


Press reports have suggested McCartney, whose fortune is
estimated at up to one billion dollars, is planning to offer
around 50 million dollars to his estranged wife as settlement to
end the bitter divorce battle.
