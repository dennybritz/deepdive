The European Union has promised to help end a virtual siege of
the Estonian embassy in Moscow sparked by the removal of a
Soviet-era war memorial in Tallinn, Estonia's Foreign Minister
Urmas Paet said Tuesday.


Paet said he had spoken to his German counterpart Frank-Walter
Steinmeir who "promised speedy assistance from the European Union
to normalise the situation around the Estonian embassy in
Moscow."


Germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU.


Estonia's President Toomas Hendrik Ilves has described the Moscow
embassy protest as "psycho-terror".


"Nearly two dozen citizens of Estonia are in the embassy
building, as if taken hostage. Other citizens of Estonia are
blocked from entering the embassy," he said.


About 100 youths from pro-Kremlin organisations Young Guard and
Ours have ringed the Estonian embassy since Friday, chanting
anti-Estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a
green inflatable tank at it.


The protest came after Estonian authorities removed a
controversial Soviet war memorial from central Tallinn for
relocation at a military cemetery.


Estonians see the statue -- a monument to Red Army soldiers who
died while fighting fascist forces during World War II -- as a
reminder of 50 years of Soviet occupation.
