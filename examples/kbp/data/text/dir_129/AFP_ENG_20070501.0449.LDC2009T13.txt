Six people were killed when a powerful suspected gas explosion
ripped through a five-storey apartment building in northeast
Spain early Tuesday, officials said.


"Two more bodies were found under the rubble," an official
spokesman told AFP in the evening after four had been retrieved
in the morning.


Among the dead were four women aged 18 to 80 and a man, the
spokesman added. He did not give details about the sixth victim.


Twelve other people were injured in the blast, one of them, a
little girl, seriously.


Rescue teams with sniffer dogs were struggling against smoke and
flames to find victims trapped under the rubble of the building
in the town of Palencia. Local media said cries for help could be
heard coming from the debris.


Officials said about 20 people were believed to have been in the
building at the time of the blast.


The apartment block was completely destroyed in the explosion
around 6:00 am (0400 GMT).


Palencia Mayor Heliodoro Gallego said that a gas leak was the
most likely cause of the explosion.
