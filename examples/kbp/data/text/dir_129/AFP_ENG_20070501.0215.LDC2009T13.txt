The conditions do not exist currently for a "dialogue" between
Iran's foreign minister and US Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice at the Iraq security conference in Egypt, Deputy Foreign
Minister Mehdi Mostafavi said Tuesday, according to the ISNA news
agency.


"For the moment the conditions do not exist for such a dialogue,"
he said in response to a question over whether Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki would hold talks with Rice at the Sharm el-
Sheikh meeting this week.
