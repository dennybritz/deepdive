The Jury for the 32nd America's Cup has fined the Italian
Mascalzone Latino- Capitalia Team 10,000 euros for having painted
its boat with a banned type of paint.


"The Italian team used a different paint from that called for in
the America's Cup Class Rule," the jury said.


"Mascalzone Latino-Capitalia had declared this different paint
manufacturer on a form filed with the measurers, but it was not
flagged at that time as a violation."


The jury ruled that Mascalzone Latino did not gain any
performance advantage through the paint, and that the breach of
the rule was inadvertent.


"Due to this, the jury decided no sporting penalty should apply.
But noting that rule compliance is an important component of
participating in the America's Cup, the jury decided to impose
the 10,000-euro fine. The team will begin repainting its boat
immediately."
