John Browne, chief executive of British energy giant BP, resigned
with immediate effect on Tuesday after a newspaper group was
allowed to publish details of his private life, a statement said.


Browne, who was due to retire in July, lost on Tuesday his legal
battle to prevent publication of details about his relationship
with another man.
