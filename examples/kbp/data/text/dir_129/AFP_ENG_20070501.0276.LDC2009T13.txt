A man who dreamed up a plan to kidnap a Dutch millionaire's
daughter, then demanded 300 kilos of cocaine in ransom, was
jailed for eight years by an Amsterdam court Tuesday, the ANP
news agency reported.


The court said that Lorenzo Moeniralam had been behind the plan
to kidnap Claudia Melchers. Moeniralam, who was not present when
Melchers was kidnapped, has always maintained innocence.


The 37-year-old Melchers, whose father Hans made his fortune in
the chemical industry, was snatched from her Amsterdam apartment
in September 2005, and then released three days later.


Her kidnappers demanded 300 kilos (660 pounds) of cocaine as a
ransom but instead her father offered to pay five million euros
(6.8 million dollars). In the end Melchers was released without
any ransom being paid.


Prosecutors say the actual kidnapping was carried out by his
cousin, Izaan Moeniralam, who is awaiting trial.


Lorenzo Moeniralam was an acquaintance of the Melchers family and
knew them through a shared passion for bridge. He also knew
Claudia Melchers would be home alone the evening she was
snatched.


Prosecutors argued that it was Lorenzo who must have provided his
cousin Izaan with this information, the judges agreed in their
verdict Monday.


Hans Melchers made a fortune estimated at 460 million euros from
pesticide and fertiliser manufacturing.
