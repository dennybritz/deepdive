Cuban President Fidel Castro was a no-show Tuesday at the
communist country's May 1 parade, only the third time since
taking power nearly a half-century ago that he failed to appear
at the annual celebration.


Speculation was rife that Castro, who has not been seen in public
since undergoing major surgery nine months ago, might use the
all-important workers' holiday to appear and mark his return to
power.


In 48 years Castro, 80, has missed May Day celebrations just
twice, both times because he was out of the country.
