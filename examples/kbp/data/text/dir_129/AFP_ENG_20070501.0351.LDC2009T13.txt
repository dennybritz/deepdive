Rupert Murdoch's media empire, News Corp, launched a takeover bid
Tuesday for the US publishing firm Dow Jones, which owns the Wall
Street Journal newspaper, Dow Jones said.


Dow Jones said in a statement it "has received an unsolicited
proposal from News Corporation to acquire all of the outstanding
shares of Dow Jones common stock and Class B common stock for
60.00 dollars per share in cash, or in a combination of cash and
News Corporation securities."


The offer would be worth some five billion dollars for the
company that publishes the Wall Street Journal and its
international and online editions, and has other media interests
worldwide.


The Dow Jones statement said the board of directions and members
and trustees of the Bancroft family, who hold a majority of
voting shares, "are evaluating the proposal" and added that
"there can be no assurance that this evaluation will lead to any
transaction."


Dow Jones shares were suspended on the New York Stock Exchange
after they rocketed over 57 percent to around 57.28 dollars a
share in the wake of the report.
