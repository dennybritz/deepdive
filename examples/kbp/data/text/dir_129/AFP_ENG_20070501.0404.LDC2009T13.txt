US President George W. Bush said Tuesday that a conference this
week on Iraq's security will be "an important test" of whether
Iran and Syria truly want to help their war-torn neighbor.


"Iran and Syria have been invited to attend. This will be an
important test of whether these regimes are truly interested in
playing a constructive role in Iraq," he said in a speech
defending his handling of the unpopular war.
