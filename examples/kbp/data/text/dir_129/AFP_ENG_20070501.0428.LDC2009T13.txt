Germany international striker Miroslav Klose has agreed terms to
leave Werder Bremen for defending Bundesliga champions Bayern
Munich either this summer or next, say reports in the German
press.


The 28-year-old, the top-scorer at last year's World Cup, has
long been a Bayern target and Munich's daily newspaper
Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted "a reliable source" who confirmed it
was a done deal.


Klose got into hot water last week when he met with Bayern
officials in a Hanover hotel, a move which forced the veteran
international to apologise to the club and their fans.


Bremen's bosses have repeatedly insisted they will only allow
Klose to switch to Bayern when his contract expires in 2008.


But according to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Bayern, who could sign
Klose on a free transfer next year, want to force Bremen's hand
by offering 15 million for the striker who has scored 33 goals in
67 internationals.


The same paper reported the transfer to Bayern of Italian
international Luca Toni, under contract at Fiorentina, has also
been finalised.


Italian sports paper the Gazzetta dello Sports announced on
Saturday Toni has agreed terms with Bayern for a contract giving
him 5.5 million euro a year.


The agent of the World Cup winning striker insists "nothing has
been finalised".
