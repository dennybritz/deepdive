A car carrying the charge d'affaires of the Czech embassy in
Afghanistan was fired on by unidentified assailants Tuesday,
injuring his two bodyguards, the Czech foreign ministry said.


The diplomat, Filip Velach, was unhurt in the attack, which was
carried out 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Kabul, a ministry
spokeswoman said.


The three managed to take refuge in a house from where they sent
out a distress call to be rescued by NATO's International
Security Assistance Force. They were taken by helicopter to a US
military base, the spokeswoman said.


Velach has been heading the Czech Republic's diplomatic mission
in Kabul since mid-April. Around 180 Czech soldiers are serving
in the country.
