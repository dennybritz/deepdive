Top seed Tommy Haas accepted the jeers he heard from his home
fans after his first round exit from Munich's ATP tennis
tournament in straight sets by Frenchman Sebastian Grosjean on
Tuesday.


The 29-year-old German, ranked 11th in the world, was the biggest
casualty of the day as he went down 6-4, 6-4 in just an hour and
27 minutes to Grosjean, ranked 58th in the world.


While Germany's Davis Cup players Philipp Kohlschreiber,
Alexander Waske and Benjamin Becker all made it through on day
two, Haas slipped at the first hurdle, as he did last year, and
admitted he was as disappointed as his fans.


"I can understand the whistles and boos, the fans want to see a
win," said Haas, with the Frenchman enjoying his fifth win over
the German.


Haas never found his rhythm on the centre court and paid the
price.


"I simply didn't play well enough," he said.


"The disappointment is huge, you want to play well at home and
show your best, it's very frustrating."
