Iraq objects to a clause in a draft resolution to be adopted at
this week's security conference in Egypt that would set a
timetable for withdrawing foreign troops, the MENA news agency
said Tuesday.


"We have agreed to 99 percent of the resolution which was put
forward by Egypt," Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abawi said
in Cairo on Monday, "but there are reservations about laying down
a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq.


"It is premature to discuss the withdrawal of troops. That is
related to the position of the Iraqi government, because it
should define the timetable."


Abawi was attending preparatory meetings for a conference on
Iraq's security to be held at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-
Sheikh on Friday.


The meeting will bring together Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Egypt, Bahrain as well as the Arab League,
the Organisation of Islamic Conference and the United Nations.


Representatives from 49 countries will head to Sharm el-Sheikh
for two meetings on Iraq on Thursday and Friday. The first day
will see Iraqi donors aiming to slash Baghdad's foreign debt and
boost reconstruction efforts.
