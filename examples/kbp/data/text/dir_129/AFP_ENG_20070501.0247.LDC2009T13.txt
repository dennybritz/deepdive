Sixty-one people were arrested in overnight clashes in Berlin
between demonstrators and police after celebrations on the eve of
the May Day holiday, police said Tuesday.


Protesters threw bottles and stones at police in the
Friedrichshain district in the east of the capital in the early
morning hours after an anti-globalisation parade ended with a
street festival that drew about 1,000 people.


Some 5,000 police officers were deployed to avert the violence
and mass vandalism by far-left demonstrators that have marred the
labour day holiday in Berlin for two decades.


Police spokeswoman Kerstin Menzel said that a strategy of
restraint and de- escalation, combined with the swift arrest of
troublemakers, had markedly cut down on May Day-related crime in
the last three years.


"The 'outstretched hand' idea has worked," she said.


In the eastern city of Leipzig, 18 police officers were injured
by rocks and bottles when about 1,000 far-left demonstrators held
a rally after a peaceful rock concert against neo-Nazis.


Four trolley cars, three police cruisers and a street sweeper
were damaged in the riot.


Meanwhile in the western city of Dortmund, nearly 2,000 people
marched against a far-right rally scheduled for later Tuesday.
