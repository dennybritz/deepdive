A Pakistani labourer set himself ablaze on May Day in protest at
alleged bad treatment by his employers and poor living
conditions, police said Tuesday.


Mohammad Jahangir, 29, poured petrol on his body and set himself
on fire at a main square in the town of Mirpur in Pakistani
Kashmir, local police chief Khalid Chohan said.


"In his initial statement, Jahangir said he wanted to commit
suicide because he was treated badly by his superiors in the
construction company," Chohan said.


He is in critical condition in hospital with 70 percent burns to
his torso, doctors said.
