The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexis II, has returned
to Moscow after undergoing medical treatment abroad, an official
at the church's headquarters said on Tuesday.


"His Holiness is well and tomorrow he will conduct a liturgy at
the Povrovsky monastery in Moscow," Sergei Kravets told the
Russian Interfax and and Ria Novosti news agencies.


The Echo of Moscow radio station had earlier quoted a source in
Switzerland as saying the 78-year-old patriarch had been admitted
in a local hospital and that his condition was "rather serious."


Alexis II has a history of heart problems.


He was notably absent from Wednesday's state funeral of Russian
president Boris Yeltsin, with whom he was close.


The Russian Orthodox Church is the largest of the Eastern
Orthodox Churches and has seen a resurgence since the end of
secular Soviet rule.
