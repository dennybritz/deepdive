Races in the third round of the second stage of round-robin
qualifying for the America's Cup were cancelled Tuesday due to
high winds.


Average wind speed was greater than 23 knots, the upper limit set
by race organisers.


It meant that it was the seventh day of the Louis Vuitton Cup,
which started on April 16, with no racing, the first round of
qualifying having been affected by a lack of wind.


The third round of racing will now be held on Wednesday, just
before the scheduled fourth round.
