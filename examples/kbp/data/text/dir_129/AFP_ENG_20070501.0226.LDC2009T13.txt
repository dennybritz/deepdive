Some 500 Maoists in west Nepal overran a police post and
kidnapped 11 officers but later freed them, a district official
said on Tuesday, downplaying the incident as "minor."


"This was a minor dispute and no one was injured," said local
chief official Narendra Raj Sharma from Banke district, 260
kilometres (160 miles) west of Kathmandu, adding further details
were sketchy.


About 500 Maoists swarmed the remote post late on Monday, he
said, adding all 11 police officers at the post "were taken by
the Maoists, but all have now returned."


His announcement of the raid came as Maoist leader Prachanda
threatened to launch massive nationwide protests by the end of
the month unless parliament immediately ousts the king and
declares a republic.


Matrika Prasad Yadhav, one of the Maoists' five recently sworn-in
ministers, said the former rebels "were yet to receive detailed
information" about the raid on the police post and declined to
further comment.


Nepal's Maoists signed a landmark peace deal with the government
late last year that ended a decade of bloody civil war.


The Maoists have had their army and weapons confined to UN-
monitored camps, but continue to face accusations that they have
not stopped using violence and intimidation.


During the civil war, Maoist rebels would regularly stage deadly
attacks on isolated police posts.


At least 13,000 people were killed in the conflict that crippled
an already fragile economy and displaced tens of thousands of
people.
