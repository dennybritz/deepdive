Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tuesday he was optimistic
about calming a dispute over so-called "comfort women" who were
driven into brothels by Japan's military during World War II.


"My feeling about comfort women was wrongly conveyed. Therefore,
I delivered my message in a straight forward manner," Abe told
journalists during a visit to Qatar as part of his first Middle
East tour in office.


"I think congressional leaders have understood my explanation,"
the Japanese premier said.


Japan has been lobbying hard against a bill being considered by
the US Congress that would demand Tokyo issue a fresh,
unambiguous apology to comfort women and make amends.


During a meeting with members of Congress last week, Abe renewed
his expression of sympathy for comfort women, saying: "I feel
deeply sorry that they were forced to be placed in such extremely
painful situations."


In March, Abe sparked controversy by saying there was no evidence
the imperial army directly coerced thousands of "comfort women"
into brothels across Asia during World War II.


The prime minister has since stressed he stands by Japan's
landmark 1993 apology to the women.


Historians say up to 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea but
also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan, were
forced to serve as sex slaves in Japanese army brothels.
