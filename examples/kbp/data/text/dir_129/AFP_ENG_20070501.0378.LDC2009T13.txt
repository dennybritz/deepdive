Thousands of Indian sex workers took to the streets Tuesday in
the Marxist-ruled West Bengal state to press for better working
conditions.


Some 5,000 prostitutes joined a torchlight rally to mark May Day
in the state capital Kolkata, saying sex workers should be given
a different legal status.


"Give us legal status of entertainers," said banners the women
carried in the rally, which snaked from Kolkata's largest red
light district of Sonagachi to a university campus, witnesses and
police said.


Prostitution is illegal in India but the police turn a blind eye
to the flourishing trade in impoverished states such as West
Bengal.


Rally participants, encouraged by onlookers who whistled and
waved, said the sex workers will also crank up a campaign against
archaic anti-prostitution laws passed by the British when it
ruled India.


"The sex workers will soon launch a campaign across India to
press their demands for their recognition as entertainment
workers and the abolition of such laws," Swapna Gayen, a rally
leader, told AFP.
