Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, the sole candidate in Turkey's
turbulent presidential election, has decided not to attend an
international conference on Iraq in Egypt this week, officials
said Tuesday.


State Minister Mehmet Aydin, who is responsible for religious
affairs, would accompany senior diplomats and represent Turkey at
the meeting in Sharm el- Sheikh on Thursday and Friday, a
diplomat said.


The presidential election has sparked Turkey's most serious
political crisis in recent years because of the prospect of
parliament electing a politician with an Islamist background to
the presidency.


Gul belongs to the ruling Justice and Development Party, the
moderate offshoot of a now-banned Islamist movement.


The Constitutional Court was expected to rule Tuesday on an
opposition demand to cancel the first round of voting, in which
Gul narrowly missed being elected. A second round is scheduled
for Wednesday.
