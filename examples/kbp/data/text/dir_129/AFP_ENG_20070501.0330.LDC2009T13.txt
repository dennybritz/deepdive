Twelve people, including six children, were killed as they slept
in northwestern Kenya when Pokot tribal warriors attacked members
of the rival Turkana and stole thousands of animals, police said
Tuesday.


Rift Valley Police Commander Everette Wasike said more than 100
Pokot raiders attacked a village of the rival Turkana tribe
around 180 kilometres (110 miles) south of Lowdar, the largest
town in the region, at about 10:00 pm (1900 GMT) Monday night.


"They killed six adults and six children as they slept. They also
stole about 2,000 animals," he told AFP.


"We have deployed officers to the area to investigate exactly
what happened, and others to trace the attackers," he said.


Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki has vowed to crackdown on endemic
cattle rustling that has been blamed for a trail of deaths in the
dustbowl northern region in recent years.


The war-like Turkana and Pokot tribes have traditionally fueded
over cattle rustling, but the practice has become increasingly
bloody after the rivals acquired modern firearms.


A government bid last year to disarm the tribes, in which human
rights groups accused authorities of using excessive force,
failed after the fighters refused to give up arms.


Cattle rustling has increased in the region in recent months as
pastoralists seek to restock herds that were badly affected by a
searing drought across east Africa over the last two years.
