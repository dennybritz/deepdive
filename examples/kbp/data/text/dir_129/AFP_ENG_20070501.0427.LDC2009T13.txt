DaimlerChrysler posted a one percent increase in US sales in
April, the German- US automaker said Tuesday.


The struggling US-based Chrysler unit posted a two percent
increase with 193,104 vehicles sold while the Mercedes-Benz group
delivered best-ever year-to-date sales of 76,880 vehicles despite
a 1.8 percent drop in April to 20,895 units.


"Chrysler Group increased sales in April based on a solid retail
performance -- despite two less selling days than in the previous
year and a challenging market environment," said group executive
vice president Steven Landry.


Chrysler, which has been put up for sale by its German parent,
plans to launch an incentive program this month to try to shore
up sales, which it said face continued pressure from high
gasoline prices.


The program will tout the fuel economy of its cars and smaller
sport utility vehicles, and offers customers bonus cash and low-
rate financing.
