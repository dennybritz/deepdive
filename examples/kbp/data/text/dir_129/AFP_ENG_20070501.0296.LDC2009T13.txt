The US ambassador to Iraq cautioned Tuesday that even if the
reported death of local Al-Qaeda chief Abu Ayyub al-Masri is
confirmed, the movement will remain a potent terrorist threat in
the country.


Ambassador Ryan Crocker said US authorities were still trying to
confirm reports that al-Masri had been killed in a struggle
inside his group, Al-Qaeda Iraq.


"We're in touch with the Iraqis, we're trying to see what
confirmation they might have and what we can get," Crocker told
reporters by video link from Baghdad.


"If we can confirm it, if this did happen, without question it
would be a significant and positive development," he said.


"That said, I would not expect it to in any way bring to an end
Al-Qaeda's activities in Iraq," he said, noting that the
organization had adjusted and remained deadly following the death
of its previous leader, Abu Musab al- Zarqawi, who was killed
last year in a US air strike.


"It is a now a very decentralized terrorist effort, so while
removing its current head would be a good and positive thing, I
think we have to expect that we will need to continue dealing
with further Al-Qaeda attacks," Crocker said.
