French premiership club Agen have sacked coaching duo Didier
Faugeron and Loic van der Linden and handed control of the last
three matches of the season to a quartet of players.


Agen lie eighth in the Top 14, but are still under the threat of
relegation, with just five points separating the seven bottom
clubs in the championship.


Winger Luc Lafforgue, centre Conrad Stoltz, and backrow forwards
Matthieu Lievremont and Lucas Ostiglia, have taken charge of the
playing squad with the help of former player Didier Raynal.


Agen face a tough run-in to the end of the season, with two away
matches against Perpignan and Toulouse, and leaders Stade
Francais at home for the final game.
