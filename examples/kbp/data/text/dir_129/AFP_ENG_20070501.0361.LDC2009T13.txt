Most MPs in Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's party want him
to quit following a critical government inquiry over his handling
of the Lebanon war, a senior party official told AFP on Tuesday.


"There's a majority of Kadima (deputies) who support the calls
for Olmert's resignation," the official said on condition of
anonymity.
