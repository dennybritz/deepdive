Inter Milan midfielder Patrick Vieira said Tuesday he would see
out his playing days in Italy.


"I don't see myself going back to England," the ex-Arsenal player
told feelfootball.com.


"I am getting old! I am happy where I am and I will stay here for
the end of my career."


Talking about his former club Arsenal, the 30-year-old French
international midfielder said he believed the departure of vice-
chairman David Dein had put a question mark over the long-term
future of manager Arsene Wenger.


"It was a big shock to hear that David was going, I didn't really
believe it," he said.


"He has been there a long time and it is difficult to know how he
left the club so quickly.


"I believe you need more than one man to make a club, but Mr Dein
and Mr Wenger were making all the decisions and one of them is
not there any more so you can ask a few questions about the
future of the club, and Mr Wenger's long-term future, certainly.


"They started together and they have been together a long time
and I can't see Arsene finishing the job by himself. Now, if he
finishes for himself or if he leaves I just don't know.


"But as a club, Arsenal are developing good young players and I
feel the future is very, very bright for them."


Dein ended his 24-year association with Arsenal last month in a
development widely linked to boardroom divisions over how to
respond to takeover overtures from American tycoon Stan Kroenke.


Wenger for his part has said he wants to appoint an Englishman as
replacement for Dein, who played a key role in helping the
Frenchman with transfers.
