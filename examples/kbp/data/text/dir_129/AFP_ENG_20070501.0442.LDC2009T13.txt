Two Russian soldiers were injured in a blast in the mountainous
Caucasus region of Ingushetia near the restive border with
Chechnya and were not dead as thought earlier, police said
Tuesday.


"The initial information about the death of the two soldiers ...
has fortunately not been confirmed. They were wounded and
survived and are hospitalised," Ingushetia police spokesman Nazir
Yevloyev told Russia's Interfax news agency.


An earlier report said the two perished in the blast overnight
Monday near the village of Ali Yurt, in the south of the
republic, where Russian troops were carrying out military
operations.


Russian troops regularly conduct operations in the region to
track down Chechen rebels.


Russian forces have fought two wars in the last 12 years to crush
separatist rebellions in Chechnya.


An estimated 100,000 of Chechnya's one million people have been
killed in the confict and, according to official figures, some
10,000 Russian servicemen.
