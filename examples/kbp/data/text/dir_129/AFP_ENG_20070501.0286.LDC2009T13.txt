Stade Francais's French international winger Christophe Dominici
will be out for up to one month after undergoing an operation on
an injured finger.


Dominici, 34, will miss Stade's away match to Biarritz on
Saturday and the home game against Perpignan the following
Sunday.


He could return for the last match of the regular season, against
Agen on May 26, before the championship play-offs, in which the
the Parisian club will likely be involved in a weekend later.
