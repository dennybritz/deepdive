The European single currency hit an historic record high against
the Swiss franc on Tuesday, as it breached 1.65 francs for the
first time.


At about 1255 GMT, the euro climbed as high as 1.6502 Swiss
francs, compared with 1.6474 late on Monday.


Over the past week the euro has also struck record highs against
the US dollar and the Japanese yen.


The euro has drawn considerable strength from favourable interest
rate differentials and strong economic growth across the
13-nation eurozone, dealers said. In contrast, the Swiss franc
has been hampered by relatively low borrowing costs in
Switzerland.
