US President George W. Bush may veto as early as Tuesday
legislation tying Iraq war funding to a plan to start pulling US
forces from the strife-torn country in October, the White House
said.


"That's within the realm of possibility, sure," spokeswoman Dana
Perino told reporters travelling with Bush to the Florida
headquarters of the military command in charge of the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq.


Democratic congressional leaders were to hold a 3:00 pm (1900
GMT) press conference to put the last formal touches on the
legislation before it heads to Bush's desk for a certain veto.
