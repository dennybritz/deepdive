VfB Stuttgart's top-scorer Mario Gomez is back in training after
his six-week injury lay off after damaging knee ligaments and
said on Tuesday he was determined to join his side's Bundesliga
title race.


German international Gomez, who scored on his debut in February's
friendly against Switzerland, damaged knee ligaments on March 10
and was the Bundesliga's top-scorer - with 13 goals in 23 games -
before injury struck.


But the 21-year-old striker has timed his return to perfection
with Stuttgart back in the Bundesliga title race having moved up
to second last weekend after leaders Schalke 04 and title rivals
Werder Bremen both lost.


Gomez was back in training on Monday and hopes to face
relegation-threatened Mainz 05 on Saturday, saying: "I am looking
forward to getting my place back and helping Stuttgart push for
the title."


Fourth-placed Bayern Munich have fallen off the pace, so with
three games left, Stuttgart are almost sure of a Champions League
place next season by finishing in the top-three.


They will contest the German Cup final with Nuremberg at Berlin's
Olympic Stadium on May 26.


But with VfL Bocum striker Theofanis Gekas currently top-scoring
in the Bundesliga, Gomez has his work cut out to challenge the 26
-year-old's impressive record of 19 goals in 29 games.
