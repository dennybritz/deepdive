US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will participate in a
meeting with major powers involved in Mideast peace that will
also include Syria at an upcoming summit in Egypt on Iraq, a
State Department spokesman said Tuesday.


There will be "an informal meeting between members of the Quartet
and the Arab delegation that has been designated as the
delegation that's going to be explaining the Arab League
initiative," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack.


In 2006 Rice launched an ambitious initiative to revive Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations on a permanent peace accord and the
creation of a Palestinian state -- talks that had been on hold
since the outbreak of a Palestinian rebellion in 2001.


The meeting will be held after the planned gathering of
international leaders at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-
Sheikh May 3-4 for a security conference on Iraq.


The Quartet groups representatives of the European Union, the
United Nations, the United States and Russia.
