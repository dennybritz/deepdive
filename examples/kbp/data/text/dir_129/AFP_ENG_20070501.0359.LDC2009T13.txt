Turkey's ruling party said Tuesday it would be prepared to call
early general elections after the country's highest court
annulled a first round parliamentary vote to elect a new
president.


Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said the offer of early elections
was conditional on the opposition agreeing to a constitutional
amendment to lower the age at which candidates can stand in
parliamentary elections.


The Constitutional Court ruled earlier that a Friday's
parliamentary vote to elect a new president was invalid, because
not enough MPs were present for the ballot.


The ruling comes amid widespread concern in Turkey about the
Islamist background of the sole presidential candidate Foreign
Minister Abdullah Gul.


The court was petitioned by the main opposition Republican
People's Party which is hoping to force general elections
scheduled for November to be brought forward.


Up to a million people took to Istanbul's streets on Sunday to
show their concern over Gul from the ruling Justice and
Development Party, which many in secular Turkey suspect of having
a secret Islamist agenda.
