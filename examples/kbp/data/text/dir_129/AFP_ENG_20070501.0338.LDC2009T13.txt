It would be a dream come true were AC Milan to beat Manchester
United in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final and progress to
the final, according to coach Carlo Ancelotti.


"In November, after all the problems of the summer, I said that
the final in Athens (on May 23) was a utopia for Milan,"
Ancelotti said.


"Now the dream can become a reality."


Implicated in the match-fixing scandal that rocked Serie A, AC
Milan were penalised eight points and obliged to enter the
Champions League at the preliminary qualification stage.


"Thanks to the solidarity that knits us together, we've succeeded
in getting through some difficult moments and getting this far,"
the coach said.


In the first leg, Milan enjoyed a 2-1 lead at the break but a
second-half fightback handed United a precious 3-2 win against
the Italians. The winner of the semi-final will meet either
Chelsea or Liverpool, who play Tuesday.


"It's a big thing to represent Italian football and we'll try to
do ourselves proud," Ancelotti said.


"Milan has an Italian soul and I believe that it represents very
well our football. The fact that (UEFA president Michel) Platini
described the match at Old Trafford as an advert for football
makes me very happy.


"For Wednesday, I'm calm because the team makes me calm. The fact
we can concede a goal doesn't worry me. It's not a tragedy. We
have 90 minutes to play and we'll be able to score more than the
one goal we did away."
