UN chief Ban Ki-moon has appointed three leading international
personalities as special envoys for climate change to help him
negotiate on global warming, his press office said Tuesday.


The three are Chile's former president Ricardo Lagos, Norwegian
ex-prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and Han Seung-soo, a
former foreign minister of South Korea.


The three envoys will assist Ban in his consultations with
governments and other key stakeholders "on how he might
facilitate progress in the multilateral climate change
negotiations within the UN," the secretary general's press office
said in a statement.


"The Secretary General has repeatedly stated that climate change
is a   major global challenge and he intends to take a leadership
role in helping the international community address the problem,"
the statement added.


The announcement coincides with the current week-long session of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN's leading
authority on global warming, in Bangkok.
