Two Russian soldiers died in a blast in the mountainous Caucasus
region of Ingushetia near the restive border with Chechnya, the
Ria Novosti news agency said Tuesday.


The blast happened overnight Monday near the village of Ali Yurt,
in the south of the republic, where Russian troops were carrying
out military operations, the agency quoted local officials as
saying.


Russian troops regularly carry out operations in the region to
hunt down Chechen rebels.


Russian forces have fought two wars in the last 12 years to crush
separatist rebellions in Chechnya.


An estimated 100,000 of Chechnya's one million people have been
killed in the confict and, according to official figures, some
10,000 Russian servicemen.
