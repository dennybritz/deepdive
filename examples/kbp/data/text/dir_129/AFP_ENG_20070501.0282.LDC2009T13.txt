Poor rains that hit agricultural output in Morocco may have
slowed the country's growth rate in the first quarter of this
year, the central planning body (HCP)said Tuesday.


"Estimates for overall growth may be revised downwards given the
poor agricultural performance," said the HCP, without giving a
revised estimate.


In February, the HCP forecast a three percent growth rate for the
first quarter assuming if agricultural output reached 53 million
quintals and inflation was contained at 1.5 percent.


But insufficient rains had caused farm production to fall 13
percent compared to the average of the last five years, it said.


Morocco's economy grew 7.3 percent in 2006 on the back of a
bountiful harvest, against 2.4 percent the previous year.
