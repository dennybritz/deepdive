Brazilian defender Alex could be set to leave Dutch league
winners PSV Eindhoven and move to Premiership champions Chelsea,
according to a report here Monday.


Alex, 24, told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf: "There is a distinct
possibility that I will leave (the Netherlands). Chelsea are
working on arranging a working permit for me."


The defender said however he would look closely at what the
English champions, who are in action against Liverpool in a
Champions League semi-final decider on Tuesday, had to offer.


"Chelsea is a great club but it is important to me that I get the
time to play," added Alex.


"If I have to spend my time sitting on the (substitutes) bench it
will be difficult, but you never know what is going to happen
until you actually get there."
