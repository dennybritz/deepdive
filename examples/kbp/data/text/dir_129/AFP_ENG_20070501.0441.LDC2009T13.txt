US President George W. Bush will veto legislation tying Iraq war
funds to a withdrawal timeline on Tuesday, four years after
declaring "mission accomplished" there, a spokesman said.


Bush's formal rejection -- his second veto in more than six years
in office -- will come just a few hours after his Democratic foes
will send him the bill, said spokesman Gordon Johndroe.


The president will also make a statement at 6:10 pm (2210 GMT).


White House officials indicated that they were unconcerned about
the timing of the veto, which comes fours years to the day after
Bush declared Iraq "one victory" over terrorism under a giant
"Mission Accomplished" banner.
