Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov on Tuesday urged a boycott of
"fascist" Estonia for removing a Soviet-era monument from the
heart of the capital Tallinn and sparking a diplomatic row
between the two countries.


"When we see what happened in Estonia ... we cannot only protest.
We would like to moot a boycott of anyone or anything linked to
Estonia," the Interfax news agency quoted the mayor as saying in
a telephone interview.


"We must tell businessmen: snap all contact with Estonia. She has
shown us her worst face, one can almost call it fascist."


Rioting erupted in Tallinn last week as Estonian authorities
prepared to rope off the statue of the Bronze Soldier and remove
it from its central position to a military cemetery.


Estonians see the statue, put up 60 years ago, as a painful
reminder of 50 years of Soviet occupation.


But Russians, including several hundred thousand who live in
Estonia, view it as a memorial to the millions of Red Army
soldiers who died defeating Nazism in World War II.


The issue provoked two days of riots last week in which one
Russian citizen was killed and more than 150 people injured.


Russian deputies visiting Estonia Tuesday said the statue had
been put up undamaged in its new location but underlined that it
should never have been moved in the first place.
