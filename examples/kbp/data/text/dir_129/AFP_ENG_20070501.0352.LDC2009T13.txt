A coalition of Sunni insurgent groups led by Al-Qaeda's Iraq
branch denied on Tuesday that its leader, known by US officials
as Abu Ayyub al-Masri, had been killed, in an Internet statement.


"The Islamic State of Iraq reassures the ummah (Islamic nation)
on the safety of Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Muhajer, God keep him, and
he is still fighting God's enemies," the group said, using the
name it uses for its leader.


"We warn the enemy is still trying to split the ranks of the
mujahedeen in Iraq. They will not succeed in doing this, God
willing," the group added.


Iraqi authorities said earlier on Tuesday they were investigating
reports that Masri was killed on the same day during clashes
within his own group.


The US military could not confirm the claim, and Iraqi officials
admitted they had not yet laid hands on the slain militant's
corpse.


US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Garver could not
confirm the report and noted that several previous reports of
Masri's death had proved unfounded.


Sheikh Hamid al-Hayis, the leader of the armed wing of an
alliance of Sunni tribes set up to fight Al-Qaeda, said Masri was
killed by an insurgent faction which has decided to change sides
and join the forces fighting Al-Qaeda.
