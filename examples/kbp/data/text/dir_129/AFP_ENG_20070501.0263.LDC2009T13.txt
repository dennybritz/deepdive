Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon will begin this summer
filming "Speed Racer," based on the popular 1960s US animated
television series, Germany's Babelsberg Studios said Tuesday.


Sarandon, 60, will appear as the mother of the title character, a
young racing car driver played by Emile Hirsch, in a cast that
will also include Christina Ricci and John Goodman.


"Speed Racer," originally inspired by a Japanese animated series,
will be filmed at the legendary Babelsberg Studios outside Berlin
where stars such as Marlene Dietrich were born.


Andy and Larry Wachowski, the brothers behind the "Matrix"
trilogy, are to direct the movie, which is scheduled for release
next year.
