An alliance of western Iraqi tribes that works in cooperation
with US forces claimed responsibility on Tuesday for the alleged
killing of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the head of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.


"The clashes started between the Dulaim tribe, which is part of
the Salvation Council, and Al-Qaeda at 9.00am and continued until
11.00," Sheikh Hamid al- Hayis, head of the Anbar Salvation
Council, told AFP.


"They killed him along with two Saudi leaders and three Iraqis,"
he said.


The Salvation Council is the armed wing of a Sunni tribal
movement called the Anbar Awakening, made up of groups that once
opposed the US occupation of Iraq but have now switched sides to
fight Al-Qaeda.


Earlier, an interior ministry official -- citing "strong"
intelligence reports -- had said Masri was killed in clashes
between rival insurgent groups just north of Baghdad on Tuesday.


The US military has not confirmed this, and Al-Qaeda itself
denied the report in an Internet statement. Hayis dismissed the
Al-Qaeda denial, saying that any group that bombs civilians is
capable of telling lies.


The tribal leader also confirmed that his men were working with
nationalist insurgent groups -- including some of those led by
former army officers and Baathists -- that have been responsible
for attacks on US forces in the past.


"We have differences with them but we are all against Al-Qaeda
and now we are ready to repel any revenge attack," he said, in a
telephone interview.
