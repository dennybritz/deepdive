Google wants a US judge to declare it the victor over US
entertainment giant Viacom and end a billion-dollar copyright
lawsuit it claims threatens today's Internet lifestyle.


In a formal response to a lawsuit Viacom filed in federal court
in New York City in March, the California-based Internet search
colossus denied that Google-owned website YouTube is involved in
"massive" copyright infringement.


Google shielded itself with the US Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, legislation passed in 1998 that says Internet firms are not
responsible for what Internet users put on websites.


Viacom charges in its lawsuit that Google and YouTube are
intentionally ignoring its copyrights by not stopping users from
putting clips of its television programs on the globally popular
video-sharing website.


"By seeking to make carriers and hosting providers liable for
Internet communications, Viacom's complaint threatens the way
hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information,
news, entertainment, and political and artistic expression,"
Google said in its legal response.


"Google and YouTube respect the importance of intellectual
property rights, and not only comply with their safe harbor
obligations under the DMCA, but go well above and beyond what the
law requires."


Google asked the judge to immediately deny Viacom's claims and
order the New York-based entertainment company to pay Google's
legal fees and whatever other damages the court sees fit.
