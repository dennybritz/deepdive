A British soldier died in Iraq on Tuesday after being involved in
a road accident while riding his bicycle, the defence ministry in
London said.


The soldier, from the Royal Signals regiment, died in a field
hospital after the accident at Basra Air Station in southern Iraq
at around 8:00 am (0400 GMT).


The accident brings to 147 the number of British troops who have
died in Iraq since the United States-led and British-backed
invasion in March 2003.


Of those, 113 have died in action and 34 as a result of illness
or accidents.


Britain's Prince Harry, youngest son of heir to the throne Prince
Charles, is to be sent to southern Iraq as an army officer within
the next month, although it is not yet clear whether he will
serve on the front line.
