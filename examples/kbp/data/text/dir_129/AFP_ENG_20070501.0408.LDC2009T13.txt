A former forklift truck driver on Tuesday denied murdering five
prostitutes who were victims in a serial killer case that gripped
Britain last year.


Steve Wright, 49, formally entered pleas of not guilty for each
of the murder charges at an arraignment hearing at Ipswich Crown
Court.


Judge David Calvert-Smith set a provisional trial date for
January 14 next year. The case is likely to last six to eight
weeks, prosecutors said.


The defendant, who lives in Ipswich, eastern England, is accused
of murdering Tania Nicol, 19, Gemma Adams, 25, Anneli Alderton,
24, Paula Clennell, 24, and 29-year-old Annette Nicholls.


The bodies of all five women were found in villages on the
outskirts of the town during a 10-day period last December. All
the women worked as prostitutes in Ipswich's red-light district.


Wright, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and blue tie, spoke
only to confirm his personal details and answer the charges.


He was remanded in custody.
