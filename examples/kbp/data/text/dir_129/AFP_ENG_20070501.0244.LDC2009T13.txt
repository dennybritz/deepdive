English Premiership club Bolton's new manager Sammy Lee has named
veteran Wales midfielder Gary Speed as first-team coach.


The former Wales captain will take up his role immediately with
the club on the brink of securing a UEFA Cup place.


Speed, 37, will join Ricky Sbragia and Jimmy Phillips as first-
team coaches at the Reebok Stadium reporting to Lee, who has
replaced Sam Allardyce.


Lee believes Speed has a bright future in coaching, once he
retires from the game.


The Bolton boss said: "Gary is a model professional and has great
aspirations to be a top-class coach.


"He is a highly-qualified having recently gained his UEFA A
licence.


"He has great tactical and technical knowledge and is highly-
respected by his team-mates."


Speed added: "I am saddened by the departure of Sam Allardyce -
he has created a legacy that everyone is proud of here at Bolton.


"But everyone knows that life must go on and we have the
responsibility of taking Bolton forward.


"I am delighted to be joining a new exciting era for the club
under the leadership of Sammy Lee.


"Sammy has great ambition to take the club forward and I am
looking forward to being part of that process."


Speed's first game in his new role will be against West Ham at
Upton Park on Saturday when Bolton aim to cement a place in the
UEFA Cup.


They finish their league campaign by facing Aston Villa at home
and he is on course to become an ever-present in the league this
season.


Speed is due to make his 520th appearance in the Barclays
Premiership this weekend, and he is not thinking about retiring
just yet.


"I like my job, I like going to work. As long as that continues I
will play as long as I can," he said only last week.
