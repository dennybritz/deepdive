Northampton, relegated from the English Premiership over the
weekend, have dropped their appeal against the six-month ban
imposed on hooker Dylan Hartley for eye-gouging.


The 21-year-old New Zealand-born player, considered an outside
bet for England's World Cup squad, was found guilty of illegally
making contact with the eye of James Haskell and eye area of
Ireland international Jonny O'Connor with his hand during a
Premiership match against Wasps on April 15.


The appeal was due to be heard by a Rugby Football Union
discipline appeal panel on Thursday in London but Hartley will
now be sidelined for six months while relegated Northampton
adjust to life in National League One.
