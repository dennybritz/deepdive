Swiss police said on Tuesday that six Sri Lankans were injured
when fighting broke out among rival groups from the Indian Ocean
island after a May Day parade in the city of Zurich.


Two people were treated in hospital for serious head and back
injuries after a gathering of about 100 Sri Lankans following the
parade turned into a vicious brawl, Zurich city police said in a
statement.


About 30 of them fought a running street battle using wooden
poles and iron bars, it added.


Police said the reasons for the outbreak of violence were
unclear.


Switzerland is home to one of the largest, predominantly Tamil,
Sri Lankan emigrant communities in Europe.


The advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report last year
that tensions had grown within the community as the rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) engaged in extortion and
threats on exile communities to finance their guerrilla war.
