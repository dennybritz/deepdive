Russian deputies visiting Estonia confirmed Tuesday that the
Soviet-era war memorial at the centre of a diplomatic row between
the two countries had been installed undamaged at a military
cemetery.


But the delegation members insisted that the statue should never
have been moved from its original place in the city centre.


"We can see that this statue is not broken. It was transported
here carefully and placed well in this military cemetery," Leonid
Slutsky, one of the group's leaders, told AFP.


"The other question is whether we agree with the move by the
authorities to move the statue in the first place from the city
centre," he added.


"But right now, the most important thing is for us to confirm to
all our colleagues and all Europe that this statue is intact and
has pride of place in Estonia's main military cemetery."


Slutsky was speaking at the cemetery where the statue was
reinstalled Monday.


The delegation, from Russia's lower parliamentary chamber, the
Duma, are in Tallinn for crisis talks with Estonian officials
over the moving of the statue.


The issue provoked two days of riots last week in which one
Russian citizen was killed and more than 150 people injured.


Police, who had detained about 1,000 people, told AFP that most
of them had been released by Monday.
