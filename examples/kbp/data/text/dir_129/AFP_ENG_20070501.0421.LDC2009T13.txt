A second reactor in China's biggest nuclear energy plant has come
on line and will be operating at full capacity within months, the
Russian maker of the facility said Tuesday.


"The second reactor in the Tianwan has been launched at minimal
power. A controllable chain reaction has started," said a
spokeswoman for the Atomstroyexport company.


The reactor, which was supplied with nuclear fuel in March, "will
function at full power in the second half of 2007," the
spokeswoman, Irina Essipova, said.


The 3.3-billion-dollar (2.4-billion-euro) plant consists of two
Russian pressurized water nuclear reactors able to produce a
combined output of 2,000 megawatts. The first reactor was turned
on last year.


The facility is one of the biggest joint Chinese-Russian
projects.
