The major US stock indexes opened stronger Tuesday, rebounding
from a selloff Monday amid renewed market optimism and as
investors braced for monthly sales updates from the big auto
manufacturers.


In initial trades, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 37.96
points (0.29 percent) at 13,100.87 after the blue-chip index
notched up three straight record highs last week and set a new
intraday high Monday of 13,162.02 points.


The Nasdaq composite gained 5.92 points (0.23 percent) to
2,531.01 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index
rose 3.22 points (0.22 percent) to 1,485.59.


"The market hit some significant profit-taking yesterday," said
Dick Green, a president at Briefing.com.


"Today is the first day of May, the traditional start of the slow
summer period. It is too early to assume that the market momentum
has now gone, but it is worth watching," Green cautioned.


Auto shares were likely to be in focus as US giants General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler are due to release their monthly sales
figures, with the market also awaiting updates from Asian rivals
Toyota, Honda and European marques such as Mercedes and BMW.


The big US firms are struggling to ward off spiking sales by
Toyota and other Japanese auto groups on their domestic turf.
