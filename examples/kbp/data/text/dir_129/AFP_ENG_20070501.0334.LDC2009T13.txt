Turkey's Constitutional Court on Tuesday annulled the first-round
vote of a parliamentary election for a new president.


The court ruled that parliament should have convened with at
least 367 deputies in order for the voting to have begun Friday.
According to parliamentary minutes, 361 lawmakers were present in
the assembly.


The petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main
opposition party, which boycotted Friday's vote.
