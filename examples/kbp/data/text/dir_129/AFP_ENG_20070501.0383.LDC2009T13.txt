Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday inked an
accord allowing their citizens to use personal identity cards
rather than passports for travel between the two Gulf states, a
report said.


"This (agreement) came...with the desire of the leaders of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to make it easier for citizens of
the council to travel," Saudi's state news agency SPA said in a
statement posted on its website.


The GCC, which groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates, had decided to establish a common
market by 2007 and launch a monetary union and a single currency
by early 2010.


The Gulf Arab states also launched a customs union in early 2003
but  decided in 2005 to delay its full implementation for two
years to the end of 2007.
