British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged Turkey Tuesday to abide
by democratic principles, as tensions mounted over the nomination
of a former Islamist as a presidential candidate.


"I have been following developments in Turkey following the first
round of the presidential elections closely," said Blair, who has
been one of the country's most public supporters of its bid for
European Union membership.


"It is essential that all those engaged in the political process
do so in accordance with Turkey's well-established democratic
principles and in compliance with the constitution."


Prime Minister Recep Tayyip is facing a political crisis because
of concerns among secularists that his nomination of Foreign
Minister Abdullah Gul for the presidency would mean Islam creeps
into all fields of life.


Gul narrowly missed becoming the next head of the secular Muslim
state in a first round of voting in parliament last Friday.


Turkey's top court is expected to rule Tuesday on an opposition
demand to annul Friday's vote ahead of a second round of voting
this week.


Blair noted that he had told Erdogan during a visit in December
that Turkey is a "strong democracy," adding he was confident that
Ankara would continue to play a "crucial role as a key and
democratic partner".
