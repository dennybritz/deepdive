Japan's Toyota reported a 3.7 percent increase in April US auto
sales Tuesday, led by increased demand for its hybrids, trucks
and luxury cars.


"Despite rising gas prices, Tundra posted best-ever April sales
as the market's appetite for light trucks picked up this month,"
said Jim Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales
USA.


Total sales rose to 210,457 vehicles with the Toyota division up
2.3 percent at 184,462 and the luxury Lexus division up 14.1
percent at 25,995 vehicles.


Car sales rose 2.1 percent as a 32.9 percent increase in luxury
Lexus car sales offset a 1.5 percent drop in car sales at the
Toyota division.


Truck and sports utility vehicle sales rose 5.9 percent as a 30.5
percent increase in Toyota division pickup sales offset a drop in
SUV sales.


The hybrid Prius posted best-ever sales in April on a 71.8
percent increase to 13,056 vehicles while the Yaris sub-compact
also posted best-ever sales of 7,232, up 22.6 percent.
