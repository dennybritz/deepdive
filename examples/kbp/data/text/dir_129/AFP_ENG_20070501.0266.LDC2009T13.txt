Colombian authorities have confiscated what they said was a
record cocaine haul -- between 20 and 25 tonnes of the illegal
drug.


Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos told reporters Monday "this
is the greatest number of tonnes (of cocaine) ever seized."


Authorities confiscated the stash of 1,000 large packages
weighing 20-25 kilos each, on the Pacific coast in Pizarro, in
Narino department, Santos said.


The United States says Colombia is the world's leading producer
of cocaine. Its Plan Colombia is aimed at fighting drug
trafficking and illegal armed groups.
