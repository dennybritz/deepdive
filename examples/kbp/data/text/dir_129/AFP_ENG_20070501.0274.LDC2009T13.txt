The United Nations on Tuesday condemned the detention of six of
its aid workers in the war-torn Darfur region of Sudan and warned
that such acts endangered its humanitarian operations.


UN humanitarian coordinator Manuel Aranda da Silva said he
"strongly condemns the temporary abduction of six staff members"
of the UNHCR relief agency and seizure of its vehicles on Monday
in Um Shalaya area of West Darfur.


The unidentified gunmen who kidnapped the UN workers, whose
nationalities were not given, abandoned them in the desert. They
were located after a search operation led by African Union
peacekeepers, the UN mission in Sudan said.


The staffers, who were on a routine mission to a refugee camp at
the time of their kidnapping, were located unharmed in Saraf
Omra, east of Geneina, near the border between West Darfur and
North Darfur states.


Da Silva, in a statement, expressed "grave concern over the
repeated attacks on humanitarian personnel and assets that put at
risk the ongoing humanitarian efforts to assist millions of
people in Darfur."


Attacks on aid workers are common in Darfur, a vast region of
western Sudan where international organisations say at least
200,000 people have been killed and two million displaced by four
years of civil war.


Khartoum disputes the figures as exaggerated.
