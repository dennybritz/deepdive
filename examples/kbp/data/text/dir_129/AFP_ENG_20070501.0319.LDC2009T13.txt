An Australian mining firm announced Tuesday that it had begun
large-scale mining at a site in northwestern Zambia which has the
largest known reserves of untapped copper ore in Africa.


Equinox Minerals Limited said in a statement that the long-
awaited mining operation had finally begun at the Lumwana mine,
situated near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.


Graig Williams, president of Equinox, said that the start of the
work represented "another milestone in the development of this
world class project."


The 500-million-dollar (367-million-euro) project, which is still
under construction, will be officially commissioned next year and
is expected to produce about 169,000 tonnes of copper yearly.


"As the orebody is just a few metres from the surface we will
have no difficulty accessing the orebody in preparation for
commissioning in mid-2008," the statement said.


The construction of the new mine began in January last year and
remains on schedule to begin full operation by 2008, Williams
said.


The new copper mine, with a lifespan of 37 years, is expected to
lead to a sharp increase in copper production in the southern
African country, which is already among the world's leading
copper producers.
