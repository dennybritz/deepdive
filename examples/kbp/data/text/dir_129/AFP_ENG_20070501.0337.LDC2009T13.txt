Rupert Murdoch's media empire, News Corp, is planning to launch a
takeover bid for the US publishing firm Dow Jones, which owns the
Wall Street Journal newspaper, CNBC television reported Tuesday.


Dow Jones shares were suspended on the New York Stock Exchange
after they rocketed over 57 percent to around 57.28 dollars a
share in the wake of the report.


Aside from the Journal, the group also owns a news wire agency
and other publications, and manages several leading stock market
indexes, notably the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
