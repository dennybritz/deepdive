Deposed English rugby champions Sale have signed three players in
a bid to strengthen their squad.


Just 12 months after winning their first Premiership title,
Philippe Saint- Andre's men finished down in 10th in the table in
an injury-ravaged 2006/07.


And with Rory Lamont and Scott Lawson having already agreed moves
to Edgeley Park, the Frenchman has now taken his recruits for the
new season to five.


Versatile back Julien Laharrague, centre Rudi Keil and Benoit
Bourrust are latest additions - and Saint-Andre is still looking
to add to his squad with at least two more players.


Laharrague joined the Sharks in February until the end of the
season but has now extended that deal until next summer despite a
big offer from Munster.


Countryman Saint-Andre said: "Julien has won 15 caps for France
and there is a good chance he will be able to play for us during
the World Cup. I am pleased he has signed."


Keil joins on a two-year deal having spent last season with
Gloucester and is described by Saint-Andre as a "tough attacking
centre" who will be a "good addition" to his squad.


The third new arrival is Bourrust, who joines from Auch.


Saint-Andre said: "Benoit is one to watch for the future. Agen
and Stade Francais both wanted to sign him but thankfully he
chose Sale Sharks."


And the Sharks boss is still looking to bolster further.


He said: "I am in contact with agents on a daily basis and am
looking to sign at least two more players in the very near
future."
