A teenage player died when young footballers and cricketers
brawled Tuesday in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, officials
said.


Mohammad Imran, 17, was struck with a cricket bat and died after
he and his friends refused to call off a football game and hand
over a playing field to a rival group that wanted to play cricket
there, a police officer said.


"As both the groups argued, one of the members of the cricket
team started hitting Imran with a bat," senior officer P.K.
Chatterjee said, adding the victim later succumbed to his
injuries in hospital.


A hunt was on for the suspected killer.
