One of the world's most renowned orchestras, the Berlin
Philharmonic, said Tuesday it plans an investigation into its
role during the Nazi era.


"We've never really come to terms with the history of the
Philharmonic Orchestra under National Socialism," general manager
Pamela Rosenberg said.


A book is to be published this year by Mischa Aster with the
cooperation of the 125-year-old orchestra on the period between
1933 and 1945 and above all on the complex relationship that
legendary conductor Wilhelm Furtwaengler had with top Nazis.


An exhibition and a film for public television are also planned.


Furtwaengler was the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic
from 1922 until 1945 and again from 1952 until his death in 1954.


During the Nazi years, he was able to retain his position with an
often deferential attitude toward the regime, which used him as a
propaganda tool, while still working to protect his Jewish
musicians.


Hungarian director Istvan Szabo adapted the play "Taking Sides"
about Fuertwaengler's denazification trial into a film in 2002
starring Harvey Keitel as a US military officer who interrogates
him about his relationship with Adolf Hitler's Nazi party.


The conductor was cleared on all charges but his reputation
remained tainted by his proximity to the regime.
