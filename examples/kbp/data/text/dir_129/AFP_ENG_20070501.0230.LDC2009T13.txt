Muslim rebels fighting Indian rule in Kashmir are "outsourcing"
violent attacks to people who stage them for money rather than
political reasons, police charged Tuesday.


The police made the statement after arresting 12 Muslim men and
one woman on accusations of carrying out violent acts at the
behest of two militant groups -- Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul
Mujahedin.


"They were executing the nefarious designs of the militants
purely for pecuniary benefits," Inspector General of Police Shri
Murari Sahai said.


Police alleged that the 13, who had no criminal backgrounds or
known links to militants, were involved in the killings of
policemen, political workers and police sources.


"They were also involved in two attacks on the office and
residence of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq," Sahai said, referring to the
region's leading cleric and chief of a moderate faction of the
main separatist alliance, the Hurriyat.


The attacks on Farooq's compound in January caused damage but no
casualties.


"Outsourcing (of violence) has become a (Kashmir) valley-wide
phenomenon," Sahai said.


The scenic Himalayan region is in the grip of a nearly 18-year
insurgency against Indian rule that has left more than 42,000
people dead by official count. Rights groups put the toll at
70,000 dead and missing.


Kashmir is split between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, which
have fought two of their three wars over the region since
independence from Britain in 1947.
