Most MPs in Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's party want him
to quit following a critical government inquiry over his handling
of the Lebanon war, a senior party official told AFP on Tuesday.


"There's a majority of Kadima (deputies) who support the calls
for Olmert's resignation," the official said on condition of
anonymity.


But the chairman of the centrist Kadima in parliament, Avigdor
Itzchaky, insisted to AFP that "there is no attempt to oust
Olmert."


Another Kadima Member of the Knesset said that he did not think
the faction, which has 29 deputies in the 120-seat Israeli
parliament, would move to force the beleaguered premier from his
post.


"I don't believe that the party would carry out a putsch against
Olmert and I personally would not support such a move," the
lawmaker said. "The prime minister should be given time to
respond and to act."


The Israeli parliament was to convene on Thursday to discuss the
damning government inquiry that on Monday accused Olmert of
"serious failure in exercising judgement, responsibility and
prudence," of acting "hastily" and personally contributing to
"over-ambitious" and unfeasible war aims.
