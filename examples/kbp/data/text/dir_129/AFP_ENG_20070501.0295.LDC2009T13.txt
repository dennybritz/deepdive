World football's governing body is ready to try out new
refereeing teams involving four linesmen this summer, FIFA
president Sepp Blatter said in an interview published Tuesday.


Blatter told the Swiss weekly L'Illustre that he and UEFA
President Michel Platini were thinking of introducing two extra
"linesmen", who would have whistles and the power to intervene
directly from the touchline alongside the referee.


"Two of them would have flags to signal offside, like today. The
two others would intervene directly in the game, with a whistle,"
Blatter said.


"It will be tested this summer and if it gives the results we're
expecting, it could come into force swiftly," he added.


Blatter said the system would allow match officials to have more
of the field of play under watch at any one time.


But he ruled out the idea of a second referee, saying there was
considerable resistance from referees, "who think they are
primadonnas, especially in Italy".


The 71 year-old world footballing chief gave no further details
on the plans. FIFA was closed for May Day.


Blatter said recent trials had merely reinforced his opposition
to the use of video evidence during matches.
