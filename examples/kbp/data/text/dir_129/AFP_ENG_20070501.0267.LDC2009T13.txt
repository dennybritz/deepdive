A Chinese environmental activist, jailed on charges of illegally
obtaining state secrets, has been freed after spending 18 months
behind bars, a human rights group said Tuesday.


Tan Kai's father confirmed the activist's release but did not
give any more details, the Chinese Human Rights Defenders group
said.


In 2005, Tan, a computer repairer, and five others founded a
group called "Green Watch" to look into complaints by local
residents in Huashui town in the eastern province of Zhejiang
Province that pollution from a chemical factory was destroying
crops and causing birth defects.


He was arrested in December 2005 and charged with illegally
obtaining state secrets from a computer he was repairing that
belonged to a local Zhejiang government official, the rights
group said.


He was subsequently jailed after a closed-door trial.


Human rights activists insist Tan was targetted because of his
activities with Green Watch, especially with regards to the
situation in Huashui.


Demonstrations in Huashui in March and April 2005 led to clashes
with police and Green Watch was declared illegal later the same
year.
