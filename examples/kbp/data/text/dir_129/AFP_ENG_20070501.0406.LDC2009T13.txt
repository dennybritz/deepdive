Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has sacked two
constitutional court judges, his office announced Tuesday, as the
power struggle between him and his Moscow-backed prime minister
intensified.


The two judges were fired by decrees signed Monday and Tuesday
"for having violated their oath," the presidency's website said.


The 18-seat constitutional court is the ultimate deciding body
for the political crisis that has gripped Ukraine since the pro-
Western president dissolved its parliament by decree on April 2
and ordered early legislative elections.


Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych has resisted the decree, locking
the two camps into a bitter tussle that has led to almost daily
demonstrations by thousands of their supporters.


Yanukovych is supported by a parliamentary majority, which on
Monday passed a non-binding vote to have an early presidential
election happen at the same time as the legislative ones --
something Yushchenko has ruled out before the end of his current
five-year term in 2011.
