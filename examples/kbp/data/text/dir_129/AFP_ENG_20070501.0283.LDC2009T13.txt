Seven people died and 32 others, some as young as 12, were
injured in a stampede at a televised talent contest concert in
Tunisia, hospital officials said on Tuesday.


The victims, aged between 12 and 21, were trampled when the
audience surged forward as stars the TV programme "Star Academy"
appeared on stage at a theatre in the port city of Sfax, 300
kilometres (185 miles) south of Tunis.


An initial toll issued overnight Monday, a few hours after the
incident, said six people had died and a number of people had
been injured.


But one injured person had died overnight, said Ibrahim Bouchrit,
the director of the Habib Bourguiba hospital in Sfax.


Most of the 32 injured people had already been able to leave
hospital, he added.


Eyewitnesses told AFP that the appearance of two Tunisian stars,
including one from Sfax who had many fans in the audience,
prompted the surge towards the stage, knocking some to the ground
and trampling them.


President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali told the ministers of the
interior and health, Rafik Belhaj Kacem and Ridha Kechride, to go
immediately to Sfax and transmit his condolences to the families
of the dead, the agency said.


A judicial inquiry has been opened into the accident.
