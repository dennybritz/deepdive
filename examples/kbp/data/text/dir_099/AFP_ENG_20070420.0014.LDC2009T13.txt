Premier League leaders Manchester United will warm up for the
2007-2008 season with a tour of Asia that takes them to Japan,
South Korea, Macau and Malaysia.


United will kick off against J-League champions Urawa Red
Diamonds on July 17 in Saitama before travelling to the South
Korean capital for a showdown with FC Seoul on July 20.


Alex Ferguson's team then head to Macau for a match against
Shenzhen on July 23, before ending the tour in Kuala Lumpur on
July 27 against a Malaysian XI.


"The club has a large and very loyal fan base in the region and
the players always enjoy their trips to see them and play in
front of their passionate support," chief executive David Gill
told the club's website.


"Everyone is looking forward to it."


The Red Devils last visited Asia in 2005, when they played in
Hong Kong, China and Japan.
