Google said Thursday that it is building a tool for television
and film studios to get copyrighted video clips quickly removed
from its superstar website YouTube.


A "Claim Your Content" option appearing along with videos
uploaded by users will allow owners of pirated content to
instantly log complaints and get copyrighted material stripped
from YouTube.


"Google is building a tool called Claim Your Content that allows
publishers to automate the take-down process," Google chief
executive Eric Schmidt said.


"It is not a filtering system and doesn't block downloads; it
makes it much quicker for us to remove copyrighted content."


Schmidt described the project while discussing with analysts and
reporters a freshly released earnings report that showed Google
profits and revenues surged in the first three months of 2007.


"In YouTube we've had tremendous updates," Google co-founder
Larry Page said during the conference call.


"We've made many improvements to the site ... Things are going
like gangbusters there."


Since Google bought YouTube in November in a 1.65-billion-dollar
stock deal, the globally popular website has generated copyright
litigation and complaints instead of profits.


A copyright protection system that California-based YouTube
promised to have in place by the end of 2006 has yet to be seen.
