Asia's richest woman Nina Wang left her multi-billion-dollar
fortune to her feng shui master, his lawyer said in a statement
Friday, setting the stage for a costly legal battle with
relatives.


In a notice published in several Hong Kong newspapers Friday, the
lawyer for Chan Chun Chuen said a will dated October 16 2006 by
Wang, who died aged 69 earlier this month, showed he is the sole
beneficiary of her estate.


Wang's fortune is estimated to be worth at least 4.2 billion US
dollars  after she transformed her company Chinachem into a real
estate empire.


"Mr Chan is very honoured by the trust and affection which Nina
Wang has shown in passing her entire estate to him," the notice
said.


"In dealing with it, Mr Chan will at all times have regard to the
values by which Nina Wang managed her business interests and
personal affairs during her life."


Meanwhile Wang's family reportedly lodged an application in court
to claim its rights to the estate, kicking off what is likely to
be a drawn-out wrangle.
