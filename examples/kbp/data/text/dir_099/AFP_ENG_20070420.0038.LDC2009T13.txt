Siemens supervisory board chairman Heinrich von Pierer will
resign next week, according to a statement by the German
engineering giant, which is at the centre of corruption
allegations.


Von Pierer will stand down at the next board meeting on April 25,
said the statement, released late Thursday.


It said the board will propose Gerhard Cromme, the former head of
heavy industry giant ThyssenKrupp, to replace him.


Siemens is caught in a snowballing series of allegations of
bribery, corruption and embezzlement which heightened with the
recent arrest of a member of its central management board,
Johannes Feldmayer.


Von Pierer was formerly Siemens' chief executive and was hitherto
one of the most respected company executives in Germany. He
denies any wrongdoing.


"Despite its outstanding business performance, Siemens has run
into a difficult situation..," the statement quoted von Pierer as
saying.


"The sole reason for my decision today is to serve the best
interests of Siemens," he said. "My goal is to support the
company's sustained success, and our impressive performance
worldwide makes my decision much easier."
