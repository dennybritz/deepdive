Spain's energy watchdog recommended Thursday that the government
have a veto over decisions made by Italian energy firm Enel
regarding Spanish power firm Endesa, in which it has a nearly 25
percent stake.


Enel has asked to increase its voting rights in Endesa to 10
percent -- the maximum allowed under the Spanish firm's statutes
-- from three percent.


The National Emergy Commission said Enel's request should be
granted as long as the Spanish government is given the power to
veto the Italian company's decisions regarding Endesa if they go
against Spain's interests.


The Italian state owns 32 percent of Enel, Europe's third biggest
power firm.


Enel and Spanish construction group Acciona have offered 41 euros
a share for Endesa, valuing the company at 43.4 billion euros
(57.6 billion dollars). The two firms already jointly hold 46
percent of Endesa.


The offer follows a failed 40-euro bid by German power company
E.ON for the Spanish power firm.
