Iraq have fired coach Akram Ahmed Salman just three months ahead
of the Asian Cup finals after the team's poor showing in the Gulf
Cup.


Salman has been "released from his responsibilities," said a
statement issued by the Iraqi Football Association and posted on
the Asian Football Confederation website monitored here.


The Iraqi FA accepted the recommendation of a fact-finding
committee which conducted a two-month-long investigation into the
team's Gulf Cup performance in January.


Iraq failed to get past the group stages in a tournament won by
hosts United Arab Emirates.


Current Olympic coach Yahya Alwan, who steered his team to the
final of the Asian Games in December, is favourite to take over
for the Asian Cup finals in July, where Iraq are grouped with
Thailand, Australia and Oman.
