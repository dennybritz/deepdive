A Vietnam Airlines plane with 50 people on board was forced to
make an emergency landing due to technical problems, the company
said Friday.


"The decision to make an emergency landing was taken on Wednesday
after an ATR72 carrying 50 passengers took off from Noi Bai
International Airport (in Hanoi) but the pilot discovered
abnormalities in its engines," a company spokesman said.


After about 20 minutes in the air, the temperature of one engine
suddenly increased and the pilot decided to return to Hanoi, he
said, adding that a "technical control" is ongoing.


The plane was travelling to the northern city of Dien Bien.


Over the past few months, Vietnam Airlines has faced a series of
technical glitches that have led to emergency landings on some of
its domestic and international routes.
