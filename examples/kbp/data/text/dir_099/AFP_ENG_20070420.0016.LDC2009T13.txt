A man holed himself up in suburban Tokyo and opened fire on
Friday, in a rare shooting in Japan that came just days after an
assassination.


Television footage showed police officers hiding behind their
vehicles, parked outside a four-storey apartment complex in
Machida city as they tried to persuade the man who was firing to
give up.


Police declined immediate comment on the case.


The man might have been trying to flee after committing a crime
near the apartment, according to public network NHK.


Before the standoff began, a person was found in a critical
condition at a store near the apartment, Jiji Press said, adding
that nearby residents had heard gunshots.


The incident came with the nation still in shock over a
gangster's assassination of the mayor of the southern city of
Nagasaki on Tuesday.


Gun crimes are rare in Japan, which bans possession of firearms
except for police officers and a limited number of licence
holders.
