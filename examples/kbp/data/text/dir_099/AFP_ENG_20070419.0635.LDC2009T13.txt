English striker Daniele Dichio signed with Toronto FC of Major
League Soccer (MLS) here Thursday, arriving after two seasons at
Preston North End, an English club one level below the
Premiership.


Dichio, 32, began playing in 1993 and his tours of duty include
stops with Italian Serie A squads Sampdoria and Lecce.


"He brings something different that teams won't like to play
against," Toronto FC coach Mo Johnston said. "He's very good at
holding the ball up, good on set pieces and defending them, and
he brings us vast experience."


The first Canadian club in MLS history is off to an 0-2 start,
losing 2-0 at Chivas USA and 4-0 at New England.


Toronto FC also made a swap of US players Thursday, sending
midfielder Richard Mulrooney to defending league champion Houston
Dynamo for defender Kevin Goldthwaite and a first-round pick in
the 2008 MLS Draft.
