Spain's Pedro Horrillo has tested positive for Formoterol, a drug
used to treat asthma, during the Fleche brabanconne cycling race
in Belgium last April, his Rabobank team confirmed Thursday.


Rabobank said the result was "an administrative error" as the
cyclist has a prescription to use asthma medication since 1996,
but had not informed the International Cycling Union (UCI) when
he changed his treatment in February.


Rabobank said that for this reason Horrillo would not be asking
for a B-sample and they did not expect heavy sanctions to be
taken against the cyclist whom they would not be suspending.


Horillo's biggest win was a stage in the 2004 Paris-Nice race.
