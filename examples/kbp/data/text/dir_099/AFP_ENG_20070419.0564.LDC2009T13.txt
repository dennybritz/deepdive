French coach Henri Michel has signed a two-year extension to his
contract with leading Egyptian club Zamalek, it was reported
Thursday.


The 60,000-dollar-a-month deal comes despite the shock exit of
the "White Knights" from the Arab Champions League Wednesday with
Al-Faycali of Jordan winning 2-1 in Cairo to reach the final.


Zamalek, winners of the African Champions League a record-
equalling five times, were heavily fancied after forcing a
goalless draw in the first leg of the semi- final in Amman.


The four-year-old Arab Champions League offers a first prize of
two million dollars, double that of its African equivalent.


But Michel has revived the domestic fortunes of the Cairo club
and they are poised to pip Ismailia for second spot in the
national championship behind  Al- Ahly and clinch a place in the
2008 African Champions League draw.


Michel guided France to third place at the 1986 World Cup and has
also been in charge of Cameroon, Morocco and Ivory Coast at the
quadrennial showcase of international football.
