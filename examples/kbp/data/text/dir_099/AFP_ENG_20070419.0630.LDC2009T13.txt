Ten Gambian military officers were sentenced Thursday to prison
terms ranging from 10 years to life for their involvement in an
attempted coup last year, their lawyer said.


"Four officers got life imprisonment, two got 25 years and four
got 10 years each," Lamin Camara told AFP.


The officer who presided over the court martial, Sarjo Fofana,
said the ruling was "meant to put an end to coup attempts" which
have the "potential to cause a human crisis."


The accused group consists of commissioned officers and warrant
officers, of whom four were charged with treason and complicity
in the escape of supposed coup mastermind and former army chief
of staff Colonel Ndure Cham.


Cham fled the country hours after Banjul said it had unearthed a
plot to oust President Yahya Jammeh in March last year.


The coup was due to take place while the president was in
Mauritania, but he returned to Gambia, an English-speaking
enclave within Senegal, when he got wind of the plot.


Twenty-three people were arrested in connection with the plot.
Four civilians are on trial, eight will be tried later while one
detained student has been absolved of any role in the conspiracy.


Jammeh was re-elected to a third five-year term in September
polls which the opposition here rejected as a sham.
