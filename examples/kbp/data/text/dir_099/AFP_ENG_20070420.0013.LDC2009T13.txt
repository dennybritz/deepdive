Japan said Friday it would hold an emergency meeting to hammer
out fresh gun- control measures next week after a gangster's
shock assassination of the Nagasaki mayor.


"This case we had in Nagasaki is literally a challenge to
democracy," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki told a news
conference.


"The Abe cabinet wants to take it seriously and will take
action," said Shiozaki, the top spokesman of Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe.


Shiozaki will chair the "firearms eradication promotion
conference" and its first meeting will be held next week by
"analysing recent situations surrounding firearms," he said.


The mayor, 61-year-old Iccho Ito, was shot Tuesday outside his
campaign offices as he campaigned for re-election in the city
best known for the 1945 atomic attack.


Police immediately arrested a gunman said to be connected to
Japan's largest underworld syndicate, the Yamaguchi-gumi, who had
a grudge with the city over a traffic accident.


Gun control is already strict in Japan, with only police or
licenced hunters and athletes allowed to own the weapons.


Japan saw 53 criminal shootings last year, the lowest figure
since annual data was first collected in 1988, according to
police.


Nagasaki police said the mayor's assassin, Tetsuya Shiroo, used a
US-made .38-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver.


Most shootings are linked to Japanese gangs, known as yakuza, who
have interests in underworld businesses including prostitution.
