A man in California apparently armed with an AK-47 assault rifle
has threatened to make the Virginia Tech school massacre "look
mild" in comparison, police said Thursday.


Schools in the northern city of Yuba were shuttered in a lockdown
as a search was underway for Jeffrey Carney, J. Paul Parker from
the Sutter County Sheriff Department told television network CNN.


Parker said Carney, 28, called his family members and a local
pastor late Wednesday "and made statements to them that he was
going to make Virginia Tech look mild in comparison, that he was
armed with an AK-47 and improvised explosive devices and that he
wanted to commit suicide" by being killed by a police officer.


Parker said a search for the suspect was immediately launched in
cooperation with four neighboring law enforcement agencies, and
the local school districts were contacted late Thursday to make
them aware of the situation.


Carney has been arrested several times recently on domestic
violence issues and was suspected of taking methamphetamine, a
powerful stimulant.


"It is apparent that he may be actually exhibiting some symptoms
of methamphetamine psychosis. This is something we cannot
ignore," he said.


The threat emerged three days after 23-year-old South Korean
student Cho Seung- Hui went on a shooting rampage at Virginia
Tech, killing 32 people before turning the gun on himself.
