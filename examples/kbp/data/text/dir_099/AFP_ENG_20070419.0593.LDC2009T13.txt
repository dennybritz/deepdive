Bangladesh were 90-6 after 30 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against West Indies at Kensington Oval here on
Thursday chasing 231 to win.


Mashrafe Mortaza was on 29 with Mushfiqur Rahim on nine.


Tamim Iqbal was first man out run out for seven with the total on
13 in the seventh over with Aftab Ahmed following quickly caught
behind by Denesh Ramdin for six off Corey Collymore for six to
make the score 21-2.


Saqibul Hasan fell to the same combination for nought before
Mohammad Ashraful was caught hooking by Marlon Samuels off Daren
Powell for just two while opener Javed Omar became the fifth man
out caught by Chris Gayle in the slips off Powell for 16 to make
the score 35-5 in the 17th over.


Captain Habibul Bashar, who has had a dreadful World Cup with the
bat, made just 12 before he was caught by Dwayne Bravo off Powell
in the 21st over taking the score to 52-6.


Earlier, vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan hit an attractive unbeaten
91 to help the West Indies reach 230-5.


The 26-year-old added 81 for the fourth wicket with Shivnarine
Chanderpaul (50) and a quickfire 60 for the fifth with skipper
Brian Lara to help the West Indies post a challenging total.


Sarwan hit five boundaries and two towering sixes during his
90-ball knock which lifted the total for the home team who are
seeking their first win in the second round.


Neither West Indies nor Bangladesh can reach the semi-finals.
