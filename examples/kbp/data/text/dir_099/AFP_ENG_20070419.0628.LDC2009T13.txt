A Virginia Tech University logo will be featured on vehicles in
National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) races for
the next three weeks to honor victims in a shooting tragedy.


South Korean student Cho Seung-Hui killed 32 people at the
Blacksburg, Virginia, school and then himself in one of the worst
mass murders in US history.


NASCAR officials announced Thursday that the university has
allowed them to place decals with the schools "VT" logo on every
car in races this Sunday here, April 28 at Talladega, Alabama,
and May 5 at Richmond, Virginia.


"We wanted to make a simple, but strong, gesture of remembrance.
We are grateful the university gave us clearance to display their
logo," said NASCAR chairman Brian France.


"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their family
members, their friends - and the entire Virginia Tech community."
