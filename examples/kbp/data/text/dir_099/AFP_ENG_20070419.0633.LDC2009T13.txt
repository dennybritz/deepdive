The Democratic Republic of Congo Thursday ruled out joint
military excursions with neighbouring nations in its territory to
target rebels operating in the strife-torn Great Lakes region.


"The military chiefs of the DRC, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi have
adopted a common military strategy in Bujumbura to track down the
armed groups operating in the east of the country," Foreign
Minister Antipas Mbusa Nyamwisi told reporters.


"But it is politically unacceptable that foreign forces can
operate on Congolese soil," he said.


Africa's Great Lakes region has been wracked by violence since
the early 1990s, with the civil war that began in Burundi in
1993, the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and the regional war that
raged in the DRC between 1998 and 2003.
