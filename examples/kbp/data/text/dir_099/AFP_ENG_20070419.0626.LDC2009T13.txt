Switzerland will host a conference on Iraqi national
reconciliation as early as next month, Swiss daily La Tribune de
Geneve reported in its Friday edition, citing an Iraqi minister.


"We have already had a positive response" from the Swiss
authorities, Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abawi told the
paper.


He said he hoped the conference could take place at the end of
May or beginning of June, before the Iraqi parliament's summer
recess.


The Iraqi government "can only welcome an initiative that works
towards reconciliation and national dialogue," Abawi said.


"All strands of opinion will be represented, except of course the
jihadists of Al-Qaeda," he added.


The conference in Geneva will bring together some 25
representatives from all main political groups, as well as Sunni
clerics.


It is the brainchild of the Geneva-based Study and Research
Centre for the Arab and Mediterranean World (Cermam).


"All the Iraqi political parties wished to meet in Switzerland,"
Cermam director Hasni Abidi told the paper.


The Alpine country is a clear example of a peaceful federal state
where linguistic minorities and religious differences are
tolerated, he added.


The United Nations hosted a conference on Iraqi refugees and
displaced people at its offices in Geneva earlier this week.


Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan is also reportedly
planning to set up a new humanitarian forum in the Swiss city.
