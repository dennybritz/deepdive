A London local council has decided where to place a statue of
former South African president Nelson Mandela, after five years
of wrangling, it announced late on Thursday.


Mandela's likeness will be placed on Parliament Square in
Westminster, central London, alongside statues of former British
prime ministers Winston Churchill and Benjamin Disraeli, among
others.


The statue itself, which was designed by sculptor Ian Walters,
who died last year, will face the Palace of Westminster.


Though a date for the statue's unveiling has not yet been set,
the decision itself ends a row over various proposed sites, with
other options including Trafalgar Square's north terrace, or
outside the building housing the South African embassy, which
looks onto Trafalgar Square.


"The city council has consistently welcomed the principle of
erecting a statue of Nelson Mandela in an appropriate location,"
said Simon Milton, Westminster Council's leader.


"From the start it was my belief that Parliament Square was a
more suitable location for a commemorative statue than Trafalgar
Square, and I believe that the proposed location is a fitting
tribute to a truly inspirational figure."
