A yacht has been found drifting off the Australian coast with
computers running and a table laid for a meal -- but no sign of
the crew, puzzled officials said Friday.


The 12-metre catamaran was spotted by a customs helicopter about
80 nautical miles off Townsville on Australia's northeast coast,
near the outer Great Barrier Reef on Thursday, national radio
reported.


The discovery that the yacht was unmanned sparked a major sea and
air search for the three crew members, who are believed to have
set sail for Townsville from Airlie Beach in Queensland state on
Sunday.


Emergency Management Queensland spokesman Jon Hall said rescue
crews were puzzled by what they found because "everything
appeared normal".


"The engine was running, the computers were running, there was a
laptop set up on the table which was running, the radio was
working, the GPS was working and there was food and utensils set
on the table ready to eat, but no sign of the crew," he said.


"It was a bit strange."


Hall said the boat's GPS system had been retrieved and the data
would be analysed for clues to the mysterious disappearance of
the crew.


"That will now enable us to track backwards where this yacht has
actually been in the last few days, and we're hoping that can
pinpoint the search area for the missing crew," he said.


Hall said all the boat's sails were up but one was badly
shredded, while emergency equipment and a locater device were
still on board.
