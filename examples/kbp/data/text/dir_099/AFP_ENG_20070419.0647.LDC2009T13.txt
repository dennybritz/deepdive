Socialists and Islamists joined forces here Thursday to rally
against "terrorism" in the wake of a spate of suicide bombings in
Morocco's economic hub.


"We denounce these terrorist acts and our outrage reflects that
of the entire Moroccan people across the political spectrum,"
Saad Eddine Othami, head of the Justice and Development party, an
Islamist grouping, told AFP.


"There has to be a global fight against terrorism on the
cultural, religious, social, political and security fronts," he
said.


Seven suicide bombers have either been blown up in attacks or
were killed between March 11 and April 10 in Casablanca, raising
fears that the country was becoming a hotbed of Islamic
extremism.


Some 2,000 people attended the rally, shouting slogans such as
"Yes to Islam, no to the forces of evil," and "Terrorists,
Morocco does not back you."


They also held banners saying: "No to terrorism, no to violence."


A non-governmental organisation Citizen's Call expressed its
"deep solidarity" with the people of Algeria, reeling under bomb
attacks in Algiers on April 11 which killed 30 and wounded 220
others.


It urged the people of north Africa to "join hands ... and ensure
that the region does not become a terrorist haven."


The Algiers attacks came a day after three militants blew
themselves up and a fourth was killed by police in Casablanca.
These were followed by two suicide bomb attacks near the US
consulate here on Saturday.
