Two US lawmakers introduced legislation Thursday aimed at
codifying a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, one day after
the Supreme Court banned a controversial late-term abortion
procedure.


The proposed law would codify abortion rights for the first time,
said Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler, who joined the
effort launched by Senator Barbara Boxer.


The legislation "would bar government -- at any level -- from
interfering with a woman's fundamental right to choose to bear a
child, or to terminate a pregnancy," Nadler said.


"We can no longer rely on the Supreme Court to protect a woman's
constitutional right to choose" he said.


"This Supreme Court may have gone out of the business of
protecting women's rights; it is time that Congress stand up to
the challenge."


A divided Supreme Court voted 5-4 Wednesday to uphold a 2003 law
passed by Congress banning what critics call "partial birth
abortion."


The bellwether ruling was a major victory for conservative forces
in the United States, which have battled for decades to reverse
the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing a woman's
legal right to terminate a pregnancy.


It is the first time the high court has upheld a ban of a
specific abortion procedure since Roe v. Wade.


The fate of the legislation offered Thursday is unclear as
Democratic leaders, who control Congress since January, did not
promise a debate on the divisive issue.
