Japan sounded an alert Friday for small tsunami waves after a
strong earthquake in the southern island chain of Okinawa.


The Meteorological Agency forecast that waves of around 50
centimeters would hit Miyako island in the Okinawan chain after
an aftershock to a strong 6.2-magnitude earthquake earlier in the
day.
