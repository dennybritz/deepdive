Hong Kong share prices opened 0.97 percent higher Friday in a
rebound after Thursday's sharp drop, with investors hoping  China
will take a measured approach as it tries to cool down its
economy, dealers said.


China is widely expected to adopt further macro-economic
tightening measures after first-quarter gross domestic product
growth and March inflation came in stronger than expected.


The Hang Seng Index opened up 196.12 points at 20,495.83.
