Boca Juniors veteran striker Guillermo Barros Schelotto on
Thursday signed a one-year deal to play for Columbus Crew in
Major League Soccer (MLS).


"I've accepted the offer they've made and I'll travel to the
United States in the coming days," said the 33-year-old
Argentine, who had two months left on his deal with Boca Juniors.


Schelotto holds the Boca record for the number of titles won by a
player with 15 to his name. He has scored 86 goals in 300 matches
during his career.
