National Basketball Association attendance set a record for the
third season in a row with 21,841,480 spectators for the just-
concluded season, the league announced Thursday.


The average attendance of 17,757 spectators a game broke last
season's mark of 17,558 a game and the new total attendance mark
improved upon last season's record of 21,595,804.


NBA arenas overall were filled to 92.3 percent capacity with a
total of 600 sellout games, a 27 percent jump over the 471 last
season and the most in the league for more than a decade.


"We are grateful for our fans' continued support," NBA
commissioner David Stern said. "The third straight year of record
attendance reflects the NBA's ever- increasing popularity."


The 16-team NBA playoffs begin Saturday.
