A lawmaker of the far right Danish People's Party provoked uproar
in parliament here on Thursday after comparing the Muslim veil to
the Nazi swastika.


"The (Muslim) veil is a totalitarian symbol that can be compared
to the symbols we know from the Nazi swastika and from
communism," said Soeren Krarup, the spokesman for DPP, which is a
parliamentary ally of Denmark's centre-right coalition
government.


"Islam is a totalitarian system that corresponds to the
totalitarian systems we have had in Europe, and the symbols
reflecting Islam and Nazism are one and the same," he said,
prompting outrage from most of his fellow-parliamentarians.


Krarup's statement came a day after Asmaa Abdol-Hamid, a
candidate for the former communist Unity Party in next year's
legislative elections, said she would wear the veil if she is
elected to parliament.


Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen criticised Krarup's
remark.


"I do not agree with Soeren Krarup and I don't like this
comparison at all. The Nazi symbol is a symbol of the most
totalitarian ideology the world has ever known while the veil is
a religious symbol," he told television station TV2.


He insisted however that Krarup was entitled to voice his
opinion.


"We have extensive freedom of expression in this country and
there must be freedom for each and every person to be allowed to
express their points of view," Rasmussen said.
