Serena Williams has recovered from a groin injury that forced her
out of a WTA event last week and will join sister Venus to lead
the US Fed Cup team against Belgium here this weekend.


The Americans, who also feature the likely doubles duo of Lisa
Raymond and Vania King, will play a Belgian squad lacking stars
Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin in a quarter-final tie.


Serena Williams retired from a match last week with the injury
but is back for the US squad in a tie barely a half-hour drive
from her home.


"I love playing for the United States and this is great because I
live 30 minutes from here," Serena Williams said.


Belgium beat the Americans last July in a semi-final but that was
when the Williams sisters were out and Clijsters and Henin were
playing. The Belgians lost to Italy in last year's final.


But Belgium's team this time is Kirsten Flipkens, Caroline Maes,
Yanina Wickmayer and Tamaryn Hendler.


"I told the girls we have to go out there and believe we can do
this," said Belgium captain Sabine Appelmans. "In tennis,
everything is possible. I think you have to go out on the court
thinking you can win the match."
