A senior provincial Communist Party official is being tried for
corruption involving bribes worth up to 6.5 million yuan (840,000
US dollars), state press reported Friday.


Zhang Peichang, 51, former deputy secretary of Ganzhou city's
party committee, in southeast China's Jiangxi province, is
accused of accepting bribes when he held various key government
posts, Xinhua said.


He allegedly accepted cash, luxury goods and a gold bar, as well
as an apartment worth 1.34 million yuan, for which he helped
facilitate the approval of construction projects involving roads
and railways.


Zhang was arrested last August.


The case is the latest incident of graft to dog China's ruling
Communist Party, which has said year after year that stamping out
official corruption is a top priority.


The issue is one of the top causes of public discontent in
booming China but, despite the string of recent high profile
arrests, the problem continues seemingly unabated.
