West Indies captain Brian Lara announced his international
retirement here on Thursday.


The 37-year-old record-breaking batsman said he would halt his
West Indies career after Saturday's World Cup Super Eights match
against England at the Kensington Oval here.


"This Saturday will be my last match in international cricket,"
said Lara after his team's 99-run win over Bangladesh here on
Thursday.


Lara, who turns 38 on May 2, had already announced last week that
he would retire from one-day cricket following the team's
disappointing World Cup campaign which had seen them fail to
reach the semi-finals.


He retires holding the highest ever Test match score of 400 and
with 11,953 Test runs to his name in 131 matches and with an
average of 52.88.


He has played 298 ODIs with 10,387 runs at an average of 40.57.
