Spain's two main left-wing parties agreed on Thursday to push
ahead with a stalled bill which would declare "illegitimate" the
special courts set up under right-wing dictator Francisco Franco.


The agreement was reached between the ruling Socialists, who put
forward the bill, and their parliamentary allies, the United Left
coalition of left-wing and green parties.


Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist follwing the end of a three-
year civil war in 1939 until his death in 1975.


Summary trials held during the dictactorship sentenced to death
50,000 republican sympathisers and imprisoned tens of thousands
more.


The proposed bill had been held up by several parties that make
up the United Left, which had wanted it to call for the annulment
of the rulings of the Franco-era courts.


But Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has
consistently refused to go beyond a "moral" recognition of the
injustice of Franco's summary trials, citing legal reasons.


The annulment of the rulings of Franco's courts would open the
door for claims for financial reparation.
