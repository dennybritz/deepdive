Kyrgyz authorities on Friday opened a criminal investigation into
violent anti- government demonstrations in the capital Bishkek
that riot police broke up with tear gas.


"A criminal case has been opened into the mass demonstrations,"
an official in the Prosecutor General's office told AFP. "Around
100 opposition activists were arrested."


Riot police on Thursday dispersed about 3,000 protesters who
hurled rocks and bottles at the president's office in this
Central Asian state.


"It was a provocation," an anti-government protestor told
Russia's Channel One television, who said a large number of
people suddenly appeared among the peaceful opposition protests
and provoked the police.


After the demonstrators had been cleared, police dismantled a
tent camp on a central square that had been used by protestors
for the past two weeks.


Kyrgyzstan has experienced almost weekly demonstrations since a
2005 uprising in which president Askar Akayev was ousted.


Opposition politicians have repeatedly accused President
Kurmanbek Bakiyev of failing to follow through on promises of
democratic reform made at the time of his predecessor's ouster.


Bakiyev has made some concessions to the opposition, appointing
Almaz Atambayev, a moderate critic of his rule, as prime minister
last month.
