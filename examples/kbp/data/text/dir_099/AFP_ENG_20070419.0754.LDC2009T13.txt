Two strong earthquakes rattled Japan's southernmost islands
Friday, generating a temporary warning for a tsunami.


An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 struck off Okinawa at 10:46
am (0146 GMT), just an hour after another strong tremor
registering 6.2 on the Richter scale.


The Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami alert but lifted it
about one hour later after no seismic waves hit.


The agency had forecast that waves of around 50 centimeters (20
inches) would hit Okinawa's Miyako island, a popular tourist
resort.


There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties following
the two quakes in Okinawa, a subtropical chain north of Taiwan,
local government officials said.


However, a meteorological agency official said more aftershocks
and consequent tsunamis could hit the region for the next week.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and
experiences some 20 percent of the world's most powerful
earthquakes.


The country prides itself on its rapid tsunami warnings which
lead residents to head to higher ground.


Late last month, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9
hit the Noto peninsula in central Japan, killing one person and
injuring more than 200. Last week another quake hit central
Japan, injuring 12 people.


In 1995, a 7.3-magnitude quake in the western city of Kobe killed
more than 6,400 people.
