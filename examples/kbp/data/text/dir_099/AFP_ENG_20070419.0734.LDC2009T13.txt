French right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy would sweep
presidential elections with 53.5 percent of the votes in a second
round run-off against Segolene Royal, according to a poll
released Friday.


The survey of voting intentions for the May 6 second round put
Royal, the socialist candidate, on 46.5 percent, assuming they
both pass Sunday's first poll.


However, 13 percent of respondents who said they would vote in
the run-off are still not sure who they would prefer, according
to the Ipsos/Dell survey for mobile telecommunications operator
SFR and Le Point magazine.


Sarkozy will likely top Sunday's first round with 30 percent of
the votes, with Royal trailing at 23 percent, the centrist
Francois Bayrou at 18 percent and far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen at
13 percent, according to the poll.


If there was a run-off between Sarkozy and Bayrou, the survey
found, it is the latter who would win with 52 percent against 48
for Sarkozy.


The poll was carried out by telephone over Wednesday and Thursday
among a representative sample of 1,209 registered voters.
