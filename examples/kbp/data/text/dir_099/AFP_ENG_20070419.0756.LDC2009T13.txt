India's number-three software maker Wipro beat market
expectations Friday by posting a 39 percent rise in fourth-
quarter profit on the back of more overseas orders and higher
fees.


The Bangalore-based company's net income rose to 8.56 billion
rupees (203.8 million dollars) in the three months to March from
6.17 billion rupees a year earlier, it said in a statement.


Most analysts had estimated earnings at around 7.7 billion
rupees.


Wipro's sales rose 39 percent from a year earlier to 43.33
billion rupees in the quarter.
