Liberia and the United States have clinched a military reform
deal to boost security in the war-battered west African country,
the president's office said Thursday.


The deal is "a mutual support agreement that permits the exchange
of logistic support, supplies and services between Liberia and
the US military," said a statement from President Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf's office.


Under the agreement penned Wednesday, the United States will
provide logistical aid to Liberia's army during peacekeeping
operations and Liberia in return will provide billeting and use
of facilities during US-led exercises.


"This agreement is the foundation of lots of things to come,"
said General William Ward, the deputy commander of the US
European Command who signed on behalf of the United States.


Liberian Defence Minister Brownie Samukai hailed the accord as "a
manifestation of the long-standing relations Liberia has always
had with the US".


The US government is sponsoring the retraining of the Liberian
military, outsourcing the job to Virginia-based security services
firm Dyncorp International.


Washington maintains close links with Liberia, Africa's oldest
republic which was founded in 1847 by freed American slaves.
