China will send bird flu virus samples to the World Health
Organisation, state media reported Friday, apparently in
response to WHO complaints that Beijing was not sharing them.


Early this week, WHO's China representative Henk Bekedam said
Beijing had not shared any recent samples of the virus since May
2006 despite repeated requests.


Several new cases have appeared in China since the last batch was
shared and the WHO wants more rapid sharing of samples to keep on
top of potential mutations in the avian disease that could raise
the risk of human transmission.


"Upholding the principle of openness, transparency and
cooperation, the government has always worked closely with the
international community as part of the global effort to prevent a
bird flu epidemic," the China Daily quoted the health ministry as
saying.


However, it also quoted a spokesman for the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention, Wang Lin, as saying any handover
of samples could take several months due to the care required in
transporting them.


China announced last month that a 16-year-old boy in the central
province of Anhui had died of the deadly H5N1 strain of the
virus, raising the country's death toll from the virus to 15.


Bird flu has killed 170 people worldwide since 2003.


Scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form easily spread
among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to
kill millions.
