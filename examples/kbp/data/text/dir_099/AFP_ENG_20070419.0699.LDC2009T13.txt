Mistrust and a lack of respect in bilateral relations between the
European Union and Russia are at their worst "since the end of
the cold war," EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson will say
later on Friday, the Financial Times reported.


In a speech in Bologna, Italy Mandelson will also say that Russia
tends to view the EU's engagement with former Soviet republics as
self-interested encroachment, and Europe's advice to Moscow on
democracy and the rule of law may be counter-productive.


According to the business daily, Mandelson will say that EU-
Russia relations contain "a level of misunderstanding or even
mistrust we have not seen since the end of the cold war ...
Neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other
they are entitled to expect."


"Unless we comprehend our different perceptions of the landscape
left behind by the last century, we risk getting the EU-Russia
relationship badly wrong."


In Mandelson's view, Russia tends to see the EU's relations with
former Soviet- bloc states "not as the concern of a friendly
partner, but the encroachment of a self-interested neighbour."


Ahead of an EU-Russia summit next month, he will also say that
the EU's discussions with Russia on democratic values may not
accomplish much: "Effective engagement is surely as much about
understanding how you will be perceived as choosing what to say."
