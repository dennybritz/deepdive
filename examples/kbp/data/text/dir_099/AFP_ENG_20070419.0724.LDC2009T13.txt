South Korean Defence Minister Kim Jang-Soo will visit China next
week to discuss military cooperation including plans for a
hotline and joint naval rescue operations, officials said Friday.


Kim leaves Monday for a four-day trip at the invitation of his
Chinese counterpart Cao Gangchuan.


They will have talks on military cooperation and strengthing
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, a ministry spokesman
said.


Kim and Cao will hold in-depth discussions on a plan to set up
hotlines between the two countries' navies and air forces. The
plan was agreed during Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to
Seoul this month.


Kim will also pay a courtesy call on Wen before flying to
Shanghai.


The hotline aims to reduce tensions in the Yellow Sea, where
Chinese vessels engage in illegal fishing.
