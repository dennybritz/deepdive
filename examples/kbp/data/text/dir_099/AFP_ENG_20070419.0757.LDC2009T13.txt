Suspected Islamic rebels shot dead two Buddhist women in
Thailand's restive Muslim-majority south as the country's army-
installed premier began a one-day visit to the region Friday.


The victims, aged 17 and 20, were gunned down late Thursday in a
drive-by shooting while riding a motorcycle in Narathiwat, one of
three violence-torn southern provinces bordering Malaysia, police
said.


Also in Narathiwat, militants set ablaze an elementary school
early Friday, destroying a wooden building, while three Army
rangers were hurt when a roadside bomb exploded late Thursday in
nearby Yala province.


The attacks came as prime minister Surayud Chulanont began a one-
day tour in the troubled region where he was expected to meet
relatives of victims in the three- year insurgency, which has
killed more than 2,100 people.


Violence in the south has escalated in the last six months
despite peace efforts by Surayud's government, which came to
power after a September coup, that included an apology to Muslims
for past abuses.
