The self-styled Islamic State of Iraq, an alliance of Sunni
groups headed by Al- Qaeda, said Thursday it has formed its first
cabinet, in an Internet videotaped statement.


"It has become a necessity at this stage for your brothers in the
Shura (consultative) council of the Islamic State of Iraq to
declare the formation of the first Islamic government," said a
purported spokesman of the militant group.


Among the 10 cabinet members was Abu Hamza al-Muhajer as "war
minister", said the man who wore a traditional Iraqi outfit but
whose face was covered.


Abu Hamza -- also known as Abu Ayyub al-Masri -- had replaced
former Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi after he was
killed in a US air raid in June.


Other ministers had similar pseudonyms, many of them apparently
adopting names of Sunni Arab families in Iraq.


They held portfolios like oil, agriculture, and health.


Abu Omar al-Baghdadi meanwhile continued to be the emir of the
Islamic state of Iraq, or the leader of the militant alliance,
according to the statement.


The same group had broadcast earlier on Thursday Internet footage
of the purported execution of 20 Iraqi policemen it said were
kidnapped last week in the north of the country.
