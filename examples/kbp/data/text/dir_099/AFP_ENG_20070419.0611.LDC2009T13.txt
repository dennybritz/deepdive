Cameroon will start giving free treatment and antiretrovirals to
nearly 50,000 people living with HIV, Urban Health Minister
Olanguena Awono said Thursday.


Awono said the move was made possible by a 50-million-euro (68
-million-dollar) grant from UNAIDS for the period from 2007 to
2009, state radio said.


The move targets some 43,000 adults and 4,000 children living
with the virus that can cause AIDS and are registered at special
health centres dispensing treatment to HIV patients, a health
ministry spokesman told AFP.


Cameroon has slashed fees for biological tests and ARVs several
times since 2004. But AIDS groups in the west African country say
the rates are still far too high for the common man.


According to the latest UNAIDS estimates, about 5.5 percent of
Cameroon's adult population has HIV.
