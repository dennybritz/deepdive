India's number-three software maker Wipro beat market
expectations Friday by posting a 39 percent rise in fourth-
quarter profit on the back of more overseas orders and higher
fees.


The Bangalore-based company's net income rose to 8.56 billion
rupees (203.8 million dollars) in the three months to March from
6.17 billion rupees a year earlier, it said in a statement.


Most analysts had estimated earnings at around 7.7 billion
rupees.


Wipro added 44 new clients in the quarter, as sales also rose 39
percent to 43.33 billion rupees in the quarter.


Business in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and domestic markets
grew 38 percent to 7.84 billion rupees.


For the full year to March, net income increased 42 percent to
29.42 billion rupees on sales growth of 41 percent to 150 billion
rupees, crossing the three billion dollar milestone for the first
time.


Companies such as Wipro and bigger rivals Tata Consultancy and
Infosys are fighting rising wages and a volatile rupee, whose
appreciation against the dollar dents their export earnings, by
renegotiating fees with clients and signing new contracts at
higher rates.


Wipro also benefited from the completion of acquisitions.


"An increase in billing rates and improved profitability in our
acquisitions and business process outsourcing significantly
offset (the) adverse impacts of onsite wage hikes and exchange
rate movements on profitability," said Chief Financial Officer
Suresh Senapaty.
