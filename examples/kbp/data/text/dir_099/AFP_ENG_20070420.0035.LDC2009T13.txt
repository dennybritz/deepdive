Jordan's King Abdullah II is to visit Israel within three weeks
amid growing efforts to kick-start the Middle East peace process,
a report said Friday.


Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert extended the invitation to
Abdullah during a phone conversation on Wednesday, the mass-
selling Maariv daily quoted Israeli officials as saying.


It said Abdullah will visit the Jewish state for two days and is
considering speaking before Israel's parliament, the Knesset.


Jordan is one of two Arab states to have signed a peace accord
with Israel and Abdullah has played a pivotal role in efforts to
mediate between Israel, the Palestinians and other Arab states.


An official in Olmert's office confirmed the prime minister had
invited Abdullah, but did not say whether he would make a visit.


Abdullah first visited neighbouring Israel in March 2004, when he
met then prime minister Ariel Sharon in his ranch in the south of
the country.


On Thursday, Abdullah told parliament speaker and acting
president Dalia Yitzik in Amman that a peace plan drafted by the
Arab League was an historic chance for peace in the region.


The initiative, reactivated at a summit in Riyadh last month,
"constitutes an historic opportunity to achieve Middle East peace
and end decades of conflict between Arabs and Israelis," the king
told Yitzik and her delegation during a working lunch in Amman, a
palace statement said.
