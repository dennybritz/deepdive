PGA Tour rookie Kyle Reifers fired a course-record 8-under-par 64
to charge to the lead after Thursday's first round of the 6.1
million-dollar Zurich Classic of New Orleans.


Reifers, a 23-year-old unknown who played most of last season on
the Nationwide Tour, enjoyed the low round of his career,
recording a bogey-free round that featured eight birdies.


Reifers was two shots in front of former British Open champion
Mark Calcavecchia, who started on the back nine and posted a 66.


It was a further shot back to a group of four players that
included 2005 winner Tim Petrovic. Tom Johnson, Lucas Glover,
Jason Schultz also shot 67.


Defending champion Chris Couch was tied for 77th after an even
72. He started slowly with a double-bogey and a bogey among his
first four holes.


After being moved last year due to the devastation caused by
Hurricane Katrina, the event is back at the TPC Louisiana, a
course that plays 7,341 yards.


Nearly 2,000 trees were lost due to the storm and a number of
holes were completely under water.


It took more than a year to get the course back into shape,
during which time the event was to English Turn Golf and Country
Club, its previous home, last season.
