Google reported Thursday that its profits surged 69 percent to
one billion dollars in the first three months of the year as
revenues at the world's leading Internet search company soared.


"The global growth of our core search and ads business and our
focus on building our partnerships drove our strong results in
the quarter," said Google chief executive Eric Schmidt.


"We continued to expand our worldwide footprint, adding important
new partners and growing our platform."


Google reported revenues of 3.66 billion dollars for the quarter
ended March 31, 2007, a 63 increase from the same quarter last
year.


Google said its net profit in the quarter tallied 1.0 billion
dollars, or 3.18 dollars per share, compared to 592 million
dollars, or 1.95 dollars per share, in the first quarter of 2007.
