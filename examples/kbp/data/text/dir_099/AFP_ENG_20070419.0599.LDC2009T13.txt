Kyrgyz deputy speaker Kubanishbek Isabekov denounced his fellow
deputies Thursday for their failure to respect a new weapons ban
in parliament.


"Only me, deputy Sanjar Kydyraliev and our bodyguards have
checked in our weapons," he told parliament, urging his
colleagues to leave their pistols in the cloakroom.


"In the parliamentary building there are bodyguards who walk
around with their weapons when they don't even have a weapons
permit," he added.


It was at the prompting of Isabekov that deputies voted on
Tuesday to oblige people to leave their weapons outside the
parliamentary precincts.


"We have to respect our own decisions," said Isabekov. "With a
such a serious political situation, we have to follow the law."


For the last nine days, demonstrators have taken to the streets
calling for President Kurmanbek Bakiyev to resign.


Kyrgyz deputies passed a law last December clearing themselves to
carry weapons.


Street protests take place almost weekly and three members of
parliament have been murdered since the 2005 uprising that ousted
then president Askar Akayev and brought Bakiyev to power.
