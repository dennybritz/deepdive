West Indies captain Brian Lara announced his international
retirement here on Thursday.


The 37-year-old record-breaking batsman said he would halt his
West Indies career after Saturday's World Cup Super Eights match
against England at the Kensington Oval here.


"This Saturday will be my last match in international cricket,"
said Lara after his team's 99-run win over Bangladesh here on
Thursday.
