The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at a record high above
12,800 points for a second straight day Thursday as robust
earnings news fueled modest gains for blue chips.


Better-than-expected earnings from financial heavyweight Bank of
America helped support the Dow, which managed a slight gain from
a day earlier.


The benchmark Dow index rose 5.20 points (0.04 percent) to
12,809.04 at the closing bell, notching up a new high after
closing at 12,803.84 a day earlier.


The other US share gauges failed to keep their heads above water,
however.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index lost 1.73 points
(0.12 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,470.77 and the tech-
dominated Nasdaq composite index ended down 5.15 points (0.21
percent) at 2,505.35.


Analysts said Bank of America's latest profits, which rose five
percent to 5.26 billion dollars, helped underpin the Dow as the
first quarter earnings season continued apace.
