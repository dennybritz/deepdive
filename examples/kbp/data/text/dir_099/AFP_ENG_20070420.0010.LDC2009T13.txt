China's outstanding foreign debt rose to 323 billion dollars at
the end of 2006, up 41.9 billion dolllars, or 14.9 percent, from
a year earlier, state press reported Friday.


Mid-term to long-term foreign debt grew 11.6 percent to 139.4
billion dollars, the official China Securities Journal reported,
citing the foreign currency administration.


Short term foreign debt totaled 183.6 billion dollars, up 17.6
percent from a year earlier and accounted for 56.9 percent of the
whole, the  State Administration of Foreign Exchange said.


The Chinese government introduced new regulations late last year
aimed at curbing the growth of short-term foreign debt, which
authorities believe is largely used to fund speculative domestic
investments.
