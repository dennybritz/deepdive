A record 59 non-US players from 28 nations will compete in the
National Basketball Association playoffs, the league announced
here Thursday.


Defending champion Miami is the only club among the 16 playoff
teams to feature an all-American roster. The Heat beat Dallas in
the NBA Finals last year, when 44 global players from 25 nations
took part in the playoffs.


Golden State, Phoenix, San Antonio and Toronto each have six
international players, the most on any club. During the regular
season, 30 NBA clubs featured 85 global players from 37 nations.


France, Lithuania and Serbia each have five players in the
playoffs, the most from any nation, while Slovenia and South
American rivals Brazil and Argentina, the 2004 Olympic champion,
each have four players in the playoffs.


Four Africans, two each from Congo and Senegal, are in the
playoffs along with five from the Caribbean and China's Yao Ming
of Houston as Asia's lone NBA representative.
