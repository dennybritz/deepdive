A intelligence officer in Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's
Fatah party was shot and wounded Thursday evening by unknown
gunmen in the West Bank, Palestinian security sources said.


Ibrahim Awis, 42, was hit by shots fired from a car when he was
walking in Qalqilya in the northern West Bank, according to the
sources.


He was taken to hospital where his condition was described as
serious.


Clashes between forces loyal to Fatah and those supporting the
Islamist Hamas movement have dwindled since the two groups agreed
on a unity government in March.
