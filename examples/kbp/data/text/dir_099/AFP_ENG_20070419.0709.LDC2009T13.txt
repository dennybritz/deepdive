The Seattle Mariners' worst fears were alleviated on Thursday as
young pitching phenom Felix Hernandez was diagnosed with a minor
elbow injury.


The 21-year-old righthander, who left Wednesday's game against
the Minnesota Twins in the first inning, was diagnosed with a
Grade 1 flexor-pronator strain in his right elbow.


Hernandez will not throw for five days, but the Mariners do not
feel the injury will be longterm. It is considered the mildest
strain.


"This is as good as news as you could receive in regards to an
elbow injury," Mariners medical director doctor Edward Khalfayan
said.


Hernandez has not been placed on the disabled list yet and could
be back within 10-20 days.


On Wednesday, Hernandez retired just one batter while allowing
two runs on two hits and two walks before the trainers came out
of the dugout and lifted him with a 3-1 count on Justin Morneau.


He pitched a one-hitter April 11 at Boston and had allowed just
four hits in 17 scoreless innings in his first two starts. His
early departure on Wednesday had clearly worried the team.


"Any time you lose a pitcher with the talent that Felix has, it's
not a good time," manager Mike Hargrove said Wednesday night.
"It's scary for him and for the club."
