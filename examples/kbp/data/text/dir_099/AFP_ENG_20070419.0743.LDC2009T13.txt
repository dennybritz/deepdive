Fiji's military regime has agreed to European Union demands to
hold elections and restore democracy within two years, the EU
said Friday.


The European bloc had threatened to suspend aid unless Fiji's
coup leader Voreqe Bainimarama agreed to respect human rights and
restore democracy quickly following December's bloodless coup.


Bainimarama had earlier said he planned to call elections within
three years but after talks between Fijian and EU officials, the
military regime had given several undertakings, the EU said.


"Fiji undertook to return to democracy and have parliamentary
elections in less than 24 months," a statement released through
the EU office in Fiji said.


The elections should take place no later than March 1, 2009, it
said.


Fiji also agreed to lift emergency regulations next month and to
guarantee the independence of the judiciary, the EU said
following the talks on Wednesday and Thursday.


"The European Union will continue and deepen the political
dialogue with Fiji to ensure the earliest possible restoration of
respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of
law."


The agreement should avoid the loss to Fiji of development aid
worth 100 million euros (136 million dollars), the bloc said.
