Taiwan's Acer Inc said Friday it replaced China's Lenovo Group as
the world's third largest personal computer vendor in the quarter
to March.


Citing a report released by IT research organisation Gartner
Datarequest, Acer said it sold 4.28 million PCs in the three
months period, up 46.1 percent from a year earlier and compared
with Lenovo's 3.97 million, up 16.1 percent.


In the quarter, Acer took 6.8 percent of the global PC market,
while Lenovo held 6.3 percent, according to the Gartner
Datarequest figures.


"Acer benefited from strong growth in Europe where sales rose
more than 40 percent," an Acer spokesman said.


Europe, Acer's largest market, accounted for about 55 percent of
the company's total sales in the quarter, the spokesman said.


The Gartner Datarequest report said that although Lenovo fell to
fourth position, the company achieved its highest year-on-year
growth rate since its acquisition of IBM's PC division in 2005.


In the January-March period 2006, Acer's PC sales totaled 2.93
million units, taking a 5.1 percent share of the global market,
while Lenovo sold 3.42 million PCs for a 5.9 percent share.


Global PC sales in first quarter 2007 rose 8.9 percent to 62.72
million, with Hewlett-Packard ranked number one with 11.03
million units and Dell ranked seond on 8.69 million.
