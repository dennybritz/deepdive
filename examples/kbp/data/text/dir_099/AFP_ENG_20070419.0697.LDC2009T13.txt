A member of China's Communist Party inner circle arrived in
Havana Thursday on a mission to improve cooperation and
friendship with Cuba, the official press reported.


Wu Guanzheng, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the
Communist Party of China, is the highest-ranking Chinese
government official to visit Cuba since the December 2005 visit
of another politburo member, Lou Gan, and Chinese President Hu
Jintao in November 2004.


"On behalf of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo, the Chinese
people and myself, I bring cordial greetings and the best wishes
for the Communist Party of Cuba, its government and the Cuban
people," Wu said, according to the daily Granma.


Wu's trip is meant to "increase friendship, consensus and
cooperation," the official daily said.


Wu was greeted at the airport by Fernando Remirez, in charge of
foreign relations of Cuba's Communist Party secretariat.


China is Cuba's second-most important trade partner after
Venezuela, with two- way trade close to two billion dollars in
2006, and one of Cuba's principal sources of credit.
