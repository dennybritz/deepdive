Bolivia's Congress formally approved on Thursday new contracts
imposed on 10 foreign oil companies as part of President Evo
Morales' plan to nationalize the hydrocarbon industry.


Lawmakers approved the 44 new contracts that the government
signed in October with companies including Repsol of Spain,
Petrobras of Brazil, Total of France, ExxonMobil of the United
States as well as BP and British Gas of Britain.


On May 1, 2006, Morales ordered the nationalization of the
hydrocarbon industry and scrapped the old contracts, on grounds
they were not enforceable under Bolivia's constitution, which
prohibits the state from selling or leasing mineral wealth.


The nationalization decree forced foreign companies to negotiate
new contracts giving Bolivia a majority share of the revenues
generated in the energy sector.


South America's poorest country, Bolivia has the region's second-
largest natural gas reserves, after Venezuela.


Morales was elected promising to share the gas wealth with
Bolivians, saying contracts negotiated under previous governments
favored the foreign multinationals.


Congress unanimously approved the new contracts after members of
Morales' Movement Toward Socialism party reached an agreement
with the conservative and liberal opposition following weeks of
debate.


Political disagreements and mistakes in the new contracts had
caused major delays in Congress's approval, which Morales must
now sign.
