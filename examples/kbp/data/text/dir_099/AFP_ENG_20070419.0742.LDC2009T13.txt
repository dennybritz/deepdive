Chinese shares prices rose 1.52 percent in early trade Friday as
investors shrugged off concerns about a possible fresh round of
economic cooling measures after the release of very strong growth
figures, dealers said.

some 4.5 percent Thursday in nervous trade ahead of the release
of China's first quarter economic growth data.


The figures released immediately after the close Thursday showed
China's economy grew 11.1 percent in the first quarter of 2007,
picking up sharply from 10.4 percent in the last three months of
2006.


Analyst forecasts had been for around 11 percent growth as the
economy runs ahead even faster despite a several moves this year
to keep economic growth at a more sustainable pace.


Although a new round of economic tightening is now widely
expected, investors remain buoyant given the current momentum in
the bourse that has seen share prices rise about 180 percent
since January last year.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, was up 52.34
points or 1.52 percent to 3,501.35.


The Shanghai A-share index was up 54.86 points or 1.34 percent to
3,679.75 while and the Shenzhen A-share index added 22.54 points
or 2.24 percent to 1,028.62.
