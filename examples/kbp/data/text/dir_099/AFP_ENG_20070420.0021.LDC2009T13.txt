Hong Kong share prices finished the Friday morning session 0.89
percent higher in a rebound after Thursday's sharp drop, with
investors hoping that China will take a measured approach as it
tries to cool down its runaway economy, dealers said.


They noted that the Shanghai market also bounced back after
dropping 4.5 percent Thursday due to worries over possible macro-
economic tightening measures.


China is widely expected to announce further policy tightening
measures after first-quarter gross domestic product growth and
March inflation came in stronger than expected.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 180.94 points at
20,480.65, off a low of 20,474.31 and a high of 20,549.92.
