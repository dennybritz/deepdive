Japanese share prices closed up 0.46 percent on Friday as
investors welcomed gains on the US and Chinese bourses amid
easing concerns about China's breakneck economic growth, dealers
said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 80.65 points to 17,452.62, having lost 1.67 percent on
Thursday on worries that China's rapid growth would require
further interest rate rises.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares advanced 3.14
points or 0.18 percent to 1,710.07.
