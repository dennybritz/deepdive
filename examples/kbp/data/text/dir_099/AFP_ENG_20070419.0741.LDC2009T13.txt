Japan sounded an alert Friday for small tsunami waves after a
strong earthquake in the southern island chain of Okinawa.


The Meteorological Agency forecast that waves of around 50
centimeters (20 inches) would hit Miyako island in the Okinawan
chain after the quake with a magnitude of 6.7 struck at 10:46 am
(0146 GMT) at a depth of 40 kilometers.


It was an aftershock to an early quake registering 6.2 on the
Richter scale in the same area about an hour earlier.


There were no immediate reports of damage of casualties following
the two quakes in Okinawa, a subtropical chain north of Taiwan,
officials said.


Late last month, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9
hit the Noto peninsula in central Japan, killing one person and
injuring more than 200. Last week another quake hit central
Japan, injuring 12 people.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and
experiences some 20 percent of the world's most powerful
earthquakes.


In 1995, a 7.3-magnitude quake in the western city of Kobe killed
more than 6,400 people.
