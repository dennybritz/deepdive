Two South Korean soldiers were found shot dead at a military base
on Friday, the army said.


The corporals, both in their 20s, were on guard duty at an
ammunition depot when a fellow soldier heard shots, according to
an army official quoted by Yonhap news agency.


"The army is investigating the incident," the official said.


The soldiers were carrying loaded rifles at the time of the
incident in the northeastern province of Gangwon.
