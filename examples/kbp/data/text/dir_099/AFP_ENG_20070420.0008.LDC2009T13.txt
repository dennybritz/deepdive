The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has pledged one million
dollars a year over the next four years to help lift the sport
out of its current dire straits in cricket-mad India.


In making the announcement, AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam
urged state governments in India and the corporate world to get
behind the development of football.


"This money is to support clubs and the league. This is not a
donation but we would like to see how it supports your clubs and
leagues," he said.


"I am expecting support of the state governments and also of the
corporate world for the development of football in India."


India, one of the most populous nations in the world, is
currently ranked 165th in the world and 34th in Asia.


Bin Hammam was in India earlier this week alongside FIFA
president Sepp Blatter, who urged the country to embrace football
and improve the sport's infrastructure in order to compete with
other nations in the region.


The AFC president was critical of the All India Football
Federation (AIFF), which is headed by federal minister
Priyaranjan Das Munshi, during the visit.


"With the existing structure, don't think of progress even in the
next 100 years," he said Monday in New Delhi.


Bhaichung Bhutia, the only Indian to play professional football
in England -- he spent three years with third-division Bury --
blamed a lack of planning for the current state of the sport.


"We have no infrastructure at all at the grassroots level," he
said recently. "There is no system in this country to encourage
young boys to play football. There is no professionalism."
