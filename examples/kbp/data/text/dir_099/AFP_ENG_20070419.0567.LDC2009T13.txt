An Algerian woman who was told she would never able to have
children is doing well in hospital after giving birth to six
girls, doctors said on Thursday.


The 27-year-old mother had been receiving fertility treatment for
the past three years.


She had been expecting seven children, but one, a boy, died in
utero, hospital gynaecologists said.


Both mother and babies are said to be in good health in hospital
in Kouba, a suburb to the east of Algiers.


However one doctor admitted that were "some concerns" for the
smallest child, weighing just 700 grams, saying that she was
suffering from "respiratory problems."


The parents expressed their joy at becoming parents as they had
lost all hope of having any children.


"I really wanted a child and God has granted me six!" the mother
said.


It is believed that this is Algeria's first multiple birth (more
than four) for over thirty years, according to experts quoted
Thursday in the Algerian press.
