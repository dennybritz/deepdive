The 25th edition of the Breeders Cup, horse racing's world
championship showdown, will be staged in October of next year
here at Santa Anita Park, organizers of the event announced
Thursday.


Santa Anita plans to renovate its main track and install a new
synthetic racing surface this summer, so the 2008 Breeders Cup on
October 24-25 will be the first with the main track races to be
contested over a synthetic surface.


"This will be a groundbreaking Breeders Cup," said Sherwood
Chillingworth, executive vice president of the host Oak Tree
Racing Association. "It will be the first on a synthetic surface
and the second time it will be a two-day event.


"We expect this to be a Breeders' Cup weekend to remember."


The Breeders Cup returns to Southern California, where it
originated in 1984, Breeders Cup Limited chairman Bill Farish
said.


"We're excited. Santa Anita is one of the world's great racing
venues," he said.


It will be the seventh Breeders Cup to be staged in Southern
California and the fourth at Santa Anita, which also hosted in
1986, 1993 and 2003. Hollywood Park hosted the 1984 inaugural and
also in 1987 and 1997.


The Breeders Cup consists of 11 races with purses and awards
totaling 23 million dollars. This year's edition of the event
will be staged October 26-27 at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, New
Jersey.
