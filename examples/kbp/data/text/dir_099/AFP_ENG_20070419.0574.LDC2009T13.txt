The Cuban government on Thursday angrily denounced the US release
of a former CIA agent wanted by Havana for the downing of a Cuban
jet, the communist country's Interest Section said in Washington.


"Cuba energetically condemns this decision and holds the US
government fully responsible for the fact (Luis) Posada Carilles
is free in Miami," said Dagoberto Rodriguez Barrera, who heads of
the communist country's Interest Section in Washington.
