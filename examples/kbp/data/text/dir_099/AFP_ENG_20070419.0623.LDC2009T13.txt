Thousands of Greek university students on Thursday demonstrated
in Athens against a government law on higher education, resuming
a protest that earlier this year brought three months of
university sit-ins and street marches.


Some 3,000 students marched before the Greek parliament building
to demand the withdrawal of the law, which tightens the academic
and fiscal management of public universities and limits the
influence of student unions.


The government says the measure will give more independence to
universities, where student unions affiliated to Greece's main
political parties currently hold sway.


But the changes are opposed by both student groups and the union
of Greek university professors, who argue that the government
ought first to increase funding for public universities.


Students also oppose a planned modification to Greece's
constitution to permit the operation of private universities.


Under the constitution, higher education is exclusively public
and free tuition is guaranteed to all Greek citizens.


From January to March, hundreds of university faculties were
under student occupation and demonstrations were held every week
in Athens and Salonika, Greece's second largest city, often
resulting in clashes with police.


In early March, 49 students were indicted after a violent riot
that brought chaos to the Greek capital, but all were released
earlier this week.
