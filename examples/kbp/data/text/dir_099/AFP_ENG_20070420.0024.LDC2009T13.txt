China is set to remain the world's largest broadband market after
recently overtaking the US, Bill Gates, chairman and co-founder
of Microsoft Corp, told a forum in Beijing.


"China has surpassed the US in the number of broadband users. And
once this is the largest market, it will stay the largest market.
There's an advantage to having 1.3 billion people," Gates said.


He noted that price constraints for fast, reliable Internet
access were falling by the wayside.


"The price of broadband has been a limiting factor, but
competition is bringing the price down," he said.


According to the state-controlled China Internet Network
Information Center, China had 104 million broadband users at the
end of last year.


China, currently a global leader in hardware, would soon become a
leader in software, he added.


"Innovation here is really growing at a rapid pace. I give a lot
of credit here to the universities. China will be a leader ...
it's already true for hardware, but it will also be true for
software," Gates said.


He added that Microsoft had China's affection for mobile
communications in mind when it recently signed a joint research
deal with China's leading computer maker Lenovo.
