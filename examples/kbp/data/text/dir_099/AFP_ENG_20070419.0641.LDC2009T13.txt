American Discovery Channel rider Levi Leipheimer won the time
trial fourth stage of the Tour of Georgia Thursday as teammate
Janez Brajkovic seized the overall race lead.


Leipheimer came out fastest in the race against the clock with a
time of 44min 51sec.


Behind him were CSC's David Zabriskie, 41sec back, and Australian
Nathan O'Neill of Health Net 1:18 behind.


This year's 30.4km time trial course was somewhat changed from
last year - offering a difficult, mostly uphill ride with a
technical final four kilometers.


Saunier Duval rider David Canada Gracia of Spain had secured the
overall lead on Wednesday, but was unable to defend that
position, falling to fifth overall as Slovenia's Brajkovic
claimed the lead.


The race continues Friday with the demanding fifth stage, the
172.1 km mountain run from Dalton, Georgia, to Brasstown Bald.
