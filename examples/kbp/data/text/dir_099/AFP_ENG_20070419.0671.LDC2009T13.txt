The former chief executive of US telecoms giant Qwest
Communications International, Joseph Nacchio, was on Thursday
found guilty of insider trading by a court in Denver.


Nacchio, 57, who was ousted from the regional telephone company
in 2002, was convicted on 19 of 42 counts of insider trading
arising from the sale of 2.5 million shares in early 2001.


The jury in the Colorado city found Nacchio guilty after retiring
to consider their verdicts last week following a three-week
trial.
