Protesters in southern Bolivia on Thursday released 58 police
they had captured one day earlier after violent clashes outside a
natural gas facility, one of the freed officers said.


Border Police commander Colonel Jaime Reyes said the officers
were freed following an agreement between the Bolivian government
and local authorities in Yacuiba who are seeking a larger share
of royalties from a huge natural gas field.


The police officers were captured by demonstrators on Wednesday,
one day after a violent clash left one person dead and several
more injured as local residents stormed a natural gas pumping
facility operated by the Transredes subsidiary of Royal Dutch
Shell.
