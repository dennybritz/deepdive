A four-star hotel on the Greek Ionian island of Corfu where two
British children died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning
has been allowed by Greece's top administrative court to
temporarily reopen, a justice source said on Thursday.


The Council of State allowed the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel to
reopen for a one- month period, pending evidence from local
authorities that its shutdown is still necessary, the source
said.


The hotel had its license suspended after the accident last
October, but operated during the Easter holidays earlier this
month.


The local tourism authority shut it down again on April 12, but
the court temporarily reversed this decision amid calls from
local MPs that the closure hurt employment and the island's
important tourism industry.


The two British children, Robert and Christianne Shepherd, died
from respiratory failure after carbon monoxide apparently leaked
into their room from a faulty boiler.


Six people including the hotel manager have been charged with
manslaughter through negligence, but no official report has been
issued on the exact causes of the incident.
