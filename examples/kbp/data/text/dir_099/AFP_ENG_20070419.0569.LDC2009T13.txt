The wife of a Yahoo user jailed in China for promoting democracy
online is suing the Internet search engine company for helping
Chinese officials track him down and convict him.


A suit filed in federal court in San Francisco on Wednesday by
the wife of Wang Xiaoning accuses Yahoo of "aiding and abetting"
torture and human rights violations by linking her husband and
others to email and online comments.


Yahoo was referred to 10 times in the Chinese court verdict on
September 12, 2003 that declared Wang guilty of "incitement to
subvert state power" and sentenced him to a decade in prison.


"I feel very angry," Wang's wife, Yu Ling, said after a news
conference on Thursday announcing the filing of the suit.


"Yahoo betrayed my husband for their business interests. They
literally destroyed my family. All my husband did was express his
political views."


The suit filed under the auspices of the US Alien Tort Statute
and the Torture Victim Protection Act names Chinese Internet
search engine Alibaba as a defendant along with Yahoo's
operations in China and Hong Kong.


The suit calls on the court to order Yahoo to stop cooperating
with requests by China to identify Internet users and to pressure
the government there to release Wang and others imprisoned as the
result of such shared information.


Wang is also demanding cash damages to be determined at trial,
according to her lead attorney, Morton Sklar of the World
Organization for Human Rights.
