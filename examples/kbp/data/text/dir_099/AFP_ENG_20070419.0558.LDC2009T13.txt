Congo have fired French coach Noel Tosi, the national football
federation said Thursday.


Federation secretary general Bakith Youlou accused Tosi of
releasing salary details to the media without permission,
spending too much time in France, and shunning Congolese members
of the national team technical staff.


But some observers here believe Tosi is being punished for
barring sports minister Marcel Mbani from addressing Congolese
players at half-time during an African Nations Cup qualifier at
home to Zambia last month.


Congo could manage only a goalless draw and after a bright start
to their six- match campaign trail South Africa by two points at
the halfway stage with two away fixtures ahead.


Tosi, a 47-year-old former coach of Mauritania, will be replaced
by his predecessor, former national team player Gaston Tchangana,
whose first major task will be the return match against Zambia in
June.


Congo are ranked 17th in Africa and 79th in the world by
governing body FIFA and have enjoyed minimal international
success since defeating Mali 3-2 in the 1972 African Nations Cup
final in Cameroon.
