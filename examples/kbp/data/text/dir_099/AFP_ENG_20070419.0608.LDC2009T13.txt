Ailing football legend Diego Maradona will be transferred from a
hospital to a psychiatric clinic next week to be treated for
alcohol abuse, his physician said Thursday.


Maradona, 46, who was hospitalized six days days ago suffering
from hepatitis- caused pain, will be taken either Monday or
Tuesday to a psychiatric clinic in Buenos Aires, said his
personal physician, Alfredo Cahe.


"Diego has become aware of the seriousness of his situation,"
Cahe told Uno radio. "From now on, the main treatment will focus
on his addiction to alcohol."


The latest medical report at the clinic De Los Arcos, where
Maradona was being treated, said the former player's health
continued to improve.


The ex-Argentina World Cup captain and Barcelona star was rushed
to the clinic six days ago complaining of severe abdominal pain,
just two days after being discharged from a different clinic
where he had undergone two weeks of treatment for illness caused
by excessive drinking.


Maradona's career on and off the football pitch has been marred
by repeated drug and alcohol abuse. He was hospitalized in 2000
and 2004 for heart attacks provoked by cocaine overdoses.
