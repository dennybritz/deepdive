Siemens supervisory board chairman Heinrich von Pierer will
resign next week, according to a statement by the German
engineering giant which has been hit by corruption allegations.


Von Pierer, formerly Siemens' chief executive and hitherto one of
the most respected company executives in Germany, will stand down
on April 25, said the statement, released late Thursday.


Siemens is caught in a snowballing series of allegations of
bribery, corruption and embezzlement which heightened with the
recent arrest of a member of its central management board,
Johannes Feldmayer.
