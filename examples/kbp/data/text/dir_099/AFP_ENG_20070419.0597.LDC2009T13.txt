Czech Industry Minister Martin Riman Thursday attacked the
grounds on which the European Commission has slashed the
country's future greenhouse gas emissions quota.


Unveiling the main findings of an analysis of the decision in
late March to cut the Czech carbon emissions quota by 14.8
percent to an annual 86.8 million tonnes between 2008 and 2012,
Riman said the commission had "seriously underestimated" future
Czech economic growth for 2009 and 2010.


"While the commission for both years counts on growth of around
3.6 percent, the average estimate of local institutions such as
the Czech National Bank and Czech Statistical Office is one
percentage point higher," Riman said, adding that the finance
ministry counts on 5.1 percent growth.


The commission also unfairly factored in the future trend of
Czech transport and domestic emissions of the main greenhouse
gas, carbon dioxide, although the EU's quota system is targeted
at forcing major industrial pollutors to cut their emissions.


The commission's projections of Czech growth and pollution were
based on preparation work by Athen's National Technical
University, which at no stage consulted the Czech Statistical
Office or his own ministry, Riman added.


Riman said his analysis would be used as a basis for a future
government decision whether to lodge an official challenge to the
commission's decision.
