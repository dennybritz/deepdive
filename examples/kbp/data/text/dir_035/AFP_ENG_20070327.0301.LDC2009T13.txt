The Scottish Rugby Board has decided to terminate the Border
Reivers professional rugby team and transfer the extra funding
generated to the Glasgow Warriors side.


Scotland has three professional clubs, two financed by the SRB
and the third side, Edinburgh Rugby, is financed by brothers Alex
and Bob Carruthers.


SRB chairman Allan Munro said: "It was quite clear that we could
not continue as we were and something had to be done if we were
to maintain and improve professional rugby in Scotland.


"The decision to close the Borders pro team has not been an easy
one, as we recognise the contribution our Borders players and
coaches have made and their real determination to succeed against
the odds.


"But we believe the Reivers closure and strengthening Glasgow
Warriors will go some way to improving high performance rugby in
Scotland."


Several players of Borders, based at Galashiels near the English
border, will be transferred to the Warriors for next season.
