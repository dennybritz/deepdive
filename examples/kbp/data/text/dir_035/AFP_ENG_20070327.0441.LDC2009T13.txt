A Ukranian woman was jailed in Belarus after being arrested
distributing leaflets with pictures of the country's opposition
leader, the Ukranian foreign ministry said in a statement on
Tuesday.


The woman served three days in a Belarussian jail after police in
Minsk caught her distributing leaflets with pictures of Alexander
Milinkevitch on Sunday. She was due to be released on Tuesday,
said the statement.


At least 1,500 opposition activists rallied in Minsk on Sunday
against Lukashenko's authoritarian rule.


Dozens of other activists were beaten back by police and
paratroopers to prevent them entering a city centre square.


Opposition leaders said on Monday that more than 100 more had
been arrested in run-up to the rally. Some have already been
jailed for three to five days, while others have received fines.


This latest incident will do nothing to ease relations between
the pro-western government of President Viktor Yushchenko and the
Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko.


Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is dubbed
"Europe's last dictator" in some Western capitals, allows no
criticism in the state-controlled media and has imposed severe
restrictions on opposition rallies.
