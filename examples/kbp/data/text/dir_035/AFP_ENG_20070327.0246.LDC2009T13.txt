EU finance ministers backed plans on Tuesday to curb national
banking regulators' powers to block mergers in the sector, which
have come under fire over concerns about protectionism.


The new rules aim to reduce the period during which regulators
can scrutinise a deal and tighten the conditions for blocking a
proposed foreign acquisition in the banking sector.


Under existing EU rules, national regulators can have powers to
block proposed mergers and acquisitions if they consider that the
deal threatens the "sound and prudent management' of the target
company.


The European Commission made proposals last September to tighten
up rules on central banks' authority over bank mergers after the
Italian central bank and Polish regulators were widely seen as
having used their powers to discourage foreign takeovers.


Cross border mergers in the sector are currently a hot topic with
Barclays seeking to tie up with Abn Amro and ING reported to be
seeking a Belgian partner.


The plans still have to go before the European Parliament for a
second reading.
