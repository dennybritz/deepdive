A majority of Americans favor pulling US troops out of Iraq by
fall 2008, but oppose cutting off funds to the 140,000 soldiers
there, according to a poll published Tuesday.


The Gallup-USA Today poll came as Democrats were pushing a bill
which ties funding for the war to a timetable to withdraw US
combat troops from Iraq by August 31, 2008.


Of the 1,007 people polled over the weekend, 60 percent support
withdrawal from Iraq in 2008, but 61 percent opposed cutting
funding for the troops in the country, which is in the grip of a
violent insurgency that has killed hundreds of people a week.


Fifty-three percent of those polled believed the insurgency would
grow if the number of US soldiers in the volatile capital was
lowered. Troops have been there since the US led an invasion in
2003 to oust the late dictator Saddam Hussein.


President George W. Bush has vowed to veto the Democrats' bill if
it includes a set timetable. Republicans have asked for time for
Bush's troop surge strategy, aimed at quelling raging violence in
Iraq, to yield results.


The proposed withdrawal timetable was inserted into a 121.6
billion dollar war spending bill endorsed by the Democrat-
majority House of Representatives on Friday, which has passed to
the Senate for debate.


The poll showed 34 percent approving of Bush's strategy in Iraq.
Fifty-six percent thought the US "made a mistake" in sending
troops to Iraq in the first place.
