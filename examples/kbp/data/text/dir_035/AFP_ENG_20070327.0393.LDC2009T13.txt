The Greek island of Corfu has agreed to lend one of its main
relics, the right hand of its patron Saint Spyridon, to the
Russian Orthodox Church for a religious tour of the country, the
island's bishop said on Tuesday.


The rare loan was approved by the leading clerics of Greece and
Russia, Archbishop Christodoulos and Patriarch Alexei II.


Corfu occupies an unlikely place in Russian military history,
briefly coming under Imperial Russian control in the early 19th
century when a flotilla under Admiral Fyodor Ushakov made a rare
foray into the Ionian Sea and captured the island from the
French.


It remains a popular destination with Russian visitors today.


Admiral Ushakov was beatified by Patriarch Alexei in 2005.


The body of St Spyridon, bishop of Cyprus in the 4th century AD,
was brought to Corfu in 1489 after Constantinople fell to the
Ottoman Turks.


But his right hand, which had previously been cut off and taken
to Rome by Latin crusaders, was only returned to Greece in 1984.


According to the Russian embassy in Athens, the saint's hand will
arrive in Moscow on April 15 and will be housed at the monastery
of St Daniel until April 26.


The relic will subsequently be taken on a brief tour of the
region until May 15, with stops at the towns of Tula, Kaluga,
Briansk, Orel, Lipetsk, Voronezh, Tambov and Riazan.
