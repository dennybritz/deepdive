The regional state authorities of Lower Saxony, where Europe's
biggest car maker Volkswagen is based, could raise their stake in
the auto giant to 25 percent, state premier Christian Wulff said
on Tuesday.


Should Lower Saxony, which currently holds a stake of 20.25
percent in VW, lose its blocking minority at the group's annual
shareholder meetings, then it would consider raising its
shareholding, Wulff said.


Currently, any one shareholder's voting rights in VW are capped
at 20 percent by the so-called VW Law. But the European
Commission wants that law, which dates back to 1960, scrapped
because it believes it violates EU rules.


A European court is expected to rule on the matter soon.


VW's ally, luxury sports car maker Porsche, announced Monday that
it had increased its stake in VW to 30.9 percent, effectively
obliging it under German law to launch a public takeover for all
outstanding shares.


But Lower Saxony has said it would not sell its holding to
Porsche.


If the regional state authorities were to lift their own stake to
a blocking minority of 25 percent, they would have to fork out an
estimated 1.15 billion euros (1.5 billion dollars).


The regional state-owned investment vehicle HanBG had sufficient
funds, Wulff said.


Stuttgart-based Porsche had announced Monday that it was raising
its stake in VW to thwart potential predators.
