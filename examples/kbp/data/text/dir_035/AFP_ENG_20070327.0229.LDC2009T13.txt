The US navy said on Monday it is staging major war games in the
Gulf involving two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and their
strike groups, at a time of high tensions with Iran.


The manoeuvres involve the USS John C. Stennis and the USS Dwight
D. Eisenhower, marking the first time the two strike groups have
operated in a joint exercise under the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, it
said.


They are being held as tensions are running high between the West
and Iran over Tehran's nuclear drive and the capture last week of
15 British marines and sailors.


"Two air wings from the aircraft carriers will conduct air
warfare exercises while the surface components will conduct
exercises in three general disciplines: anti-submarine, anti-
surface and mine warfare," the Fifth Fleet said.


The Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, an island state which lies
across the Gulf from Iran.
