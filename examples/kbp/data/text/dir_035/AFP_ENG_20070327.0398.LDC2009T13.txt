A debilitating back problem has brought about the retirement of
former England full-back Matt Perry'after a succession of
injuries during the past few years, the BBC website reported on
Tuesday.


A bulging disc has meant Perry, England's most-capped full-back
and Bath's longest-serving player, cannot play the game properly.


Perry, who won 36 caps for his country in total, travelled to the
World Cup in 1999 and was also selected for the British and Irish
Lions tour to Australia in 2001, playing a part in all three
Tests.


Perry made his debut for Bath against Northampton in 1995 and
went on to start 205 games for the club, scoring 561 points.


He said: "I can only operate at about 75 percent and these days
you have to be 100 percent or you have got no chance. The bulging
disc affects the nerves, which then affect the muscles down my
left leg especially."


Perry has often been on the treatment table in recent years and
last played for his club in December against Harlequins.


England head coach Brian Ashton said: "I have known Matt for over
a decade, he made his debut when I was coaching Bath back in
1995. He has been a great servant to his club and his country and
he is still England's most capped full- back.


"An incredible competitor, Matt's team-mates were always glad to
have him on their side. I wish him all the best in the future."
