Finance Minister Avraham Hirshson was grilled for eight hours on
Tuesday for a second time as part of a probe into corruption in a
labour union he once headed, Israeli police said.


"The interrogation lasted for eight hours and, if there is cause,
the minister will be questioned again," police spokesman Micky
Rosenfeld told AFP.


A week ago, police investigators grilled Hirshson for seven hours
over suspicions of involvement in aggravated robbery and fraud,
embezzlement, obstruction of justice and conspiring to commit a
crime.


Hirshson has denied the charges.


In January, police confirmed media reports that a graft probe had
been launched against Hirshson, the latest in a string of Israeli
officials to face corruption charges.


The allegations are part of an investigation into embezzlement of
millions of dollars from the right-wing National Workers
Federation labour federation.


Corruption probes and other scandals involving senior Israeli
officials have rocked the Jewish state during the past six
months.


Among them have been several graft probes against Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert and a looming rape indictment against President Moshe
Katsav, who has since taken a leave of absence from the largely
ceremonial post.
