Hong Kong's Marco Fu stunned multiple world champion Stephen
Hendry 5-4 in the China Open first round here on Tuesday.


Hendry had staged a sound comeback to lead 4-3 after being 3-1
down and looked set for a tidy victory, but Fu retaliated with a
72 clearance and snared victory in the decider with a 63 break.


"I felt confident because I prepared well for the match," state
agency Xinhua quoted the world number 22 Fu saying.


"I still think Stephen is a great player on his day but he is not
as consistent as he used to be," added Fu.

a comfortable victory at 5-2 over Thailand's James Wattana.


John Higgins defeated Ian McCulloch after being 2-1 down, coming
home with strong breaks of 61, 110 and 82.


Australian Neil Robertson lost the first frame to Michael Holt
but that was all. He recovered to nail Holt 5-1.
