Bertelsmann and EMI have settled their long-running legal dispute
over Napster, the now defunct music file-sharing service, the
German media giant announced on Tuesday.


Financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed.


EMI and Universal Music, a unit of French group Vivendi, had both
sued Bertelsmann in 2003 over the German company's funding of
Napster.


Bertelsmann had invested millions of dollars (euros) in Napster
in the hope of turning it into a legitimate, profitable
subscription service.


At the same time, several record companies were suing Napster for
copyright infringement. It was this action that led to the shut-
down of the service in June 2001.


Bertelsmann had already settled with Universal Music last
September, agreeing to pay 60 million dollars (45 million euros),
which included reimbursement of legal fees and expenses and
covered the resolution of the legal claims of Universal's
recorded music and music publishing businesses.


At the time, Bertelsmann insisted that it was not admitting any
liability in agreeing to the settlement with Universal.
