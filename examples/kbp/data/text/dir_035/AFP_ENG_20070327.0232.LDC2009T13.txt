Britain does not wish to escalate a standoff with Iran over 15
detained sailors, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said
Tuesday, seeking to clarify a warning of the row entering a
"different phase."


The spokesman denied that Blair's warning -- made in a television
interview -- indicated the possibility of, for example, throwing
out Iran's ambassador or military action.


"It's a different phase of how we're handling it at this stage,"
he told a daily briefing.


The spokesman reiterated that London was "utterly certain" that
the 15 navy personnel were in Iraqi waters when they were
detained in the Shatt al-Arab waterway Friday.


"So far we haven't made explicit why we know that because we
don't want to escalate this," he said, adding: "We don't want to
do that too soon because we prefer to have this ... resolved
quietly."


But he added: "We may come to the stage where we have to become
more explicit about why we know this."


Speaking earlier on GMTV television, Blair said that London was
trying to "pursue this through the diplomatic channels and make
the Iranian government understand these people have to be
released.


"I hope we manage to get them to realise they have to release
them. If not, then this will move into a different phase."
