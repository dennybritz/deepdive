World number two Rafael Nadal will not compete for Spain in their
Davis Cup quarter-final tie against the United States at Winston-
Salem, North Carolina from April 6-8.


Team captain Emilio Sanchez-Vicario, currently in Florida to
observe the form of the Spanish players competing at the ATP
Master Series in Miami, has opted for David Ferrer, Tommy
Robredo, Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez.


Nadal, who won his first title since the French Open last June at
Indian Wells last week, has been suffering from muscular
problems.


It will be eighth meeting between Spain and the USA. The
Americans lead 4-3 in previous meetings.


Spain won their last encounter at the 2004 Davis Cup final in
Seville which was played on front of 27,000 spectators - the
biggest record crowd in an official tennis match. It was the
second Davis Cup trophy for the Spanish.
