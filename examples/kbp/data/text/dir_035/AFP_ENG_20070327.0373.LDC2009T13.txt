The British wing of European aircraft maker Airbus "indisputably"
needs the British government to invest in new technology to
secure the company's long-term future, the chief of Airbus UK
said on Tuesday.


Managing director Iain Gray also revealed that he was actively
seeking "risk sharing partners" to help transform the division.


Troubled European aircraft maker Airbus, owned by Franco-German
aerospace group EADS, is axing about 12 percent of its British
workforce as part of a massive restructuring linked to severe
production delays to its flagship superjumbo A380.


Airbus UK has about 13,000 workers at Broughton, in North Wales,
and Filton in western England, designing and manufacturing wings.


"We indisputably need government funding in terms of technology
investment," Gray told a parliamentary committee in London when
asked if the firm needed further British government subsidies.


He continued: "It is fundamental that we secure investment in
future technology -- it is absolutely critical.


"It is a principal area and is paramount to the future of Airbus
and we need to fight for government funding for R and D (research
and development) investment to take the company forward."


Gray told the Trade and Industry Committee that additional
government funding would secure Airbus UK's future "for the next
20 years."
