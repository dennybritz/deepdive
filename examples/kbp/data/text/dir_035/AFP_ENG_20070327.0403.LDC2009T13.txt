The United States has posted a five-million dollar reward for the
capture of a Malaysian terror suspect wanted for several bomb
attacks in the Philippines, the State Department said Tuesday.


"Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has authorized a new reward
of up to five million dollars for information leading to the
arrest or conviction of Zulkifli bin Hir (a.k.a. Marwan)," the
State Department said in a statement.


Bin Hir, described as "a terrorist believed to be involved in
multiple deadly bomb attacks in the Philippines," had been added
to the US most-wanted list.


He is believed to have been in hiding in the Philippines since
August 2003 where he is involved in making bombs with the Abu
Sayyaf group, which is linked to the Al-Qaeda terror network.


"His younger brother, Taufik bin Abdul Halim, a.k.a. Dany, was
involved in the 2001 Jakarta Atrium Mall bombing, and currently
is in detention in Indonesia," the statement added.


The Abu Sayyaf and the Jemaah Islamiyah groups have been blamed
for the worst terrorist attacks in the Philippines including the
bombing of a ferry off Manila Bay in 2004 which killed more than
200 people.


The Abu Sayyaf group was founded by Afghan-trained firebrand
Abubakar Abdurajak Janjalani in the early 1990s to fight for an
independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
