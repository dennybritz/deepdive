An accountant who claims he may be the illegitimate son of
princess Margaret, the late sister of Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II, was back in court Tuesday trying to prove his royal blood.


Robert Brown, 52, is bidding to force the High Court in London to
let him have access to wills made by Margaret and her mother, the
queen mother, who died in 2002 aged 101, to help his case.


But Frank Hinks, lawyer for the executors of both estates, said
that Brown had produced no proper evidence to support his claim,
which he labelled "scandalous" and based on "an insane delusion."


Royal wills are not usually made public in a tradition which
Buckingham Palace claims dates back to ancient times but which
was actually introduced in 1910 to cover up a sex scandal, The
Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.


The womanising prince Francis, brother-in-law of George V --
himself grandfather of Queen Elizabeth and Margaret -- left
family jewels to a mistress, leading royals to persuade a judge
to make his will secret, the paper said.


Brown's birth mother is officially Cynthia Joan Brown, a model
who worked for the queen's former dresser, Hardy Amies, while his
father Douglas was in the British army.


One theory reportedly being used to back up Brown's claim is that
Joan and Douglas adopted Margaret's illegitimate child to hush up
a scandal.


In 1954, Margaret, who was linked to a number of men before her
death in 2002 at the age of 71, faced controversy over her wish
to wed a divorced man, Group Captain Peter Townsend.


She married photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1960 but they
were later divorced.
