British defence manufacturers on Tuesday signed here an agreement
with the Bulgarian Defence Industry Association to boost
cooperation and increase British exports.


"The British companies hope to gain some opportunity for export
business in Bulgaria,"  Alan Sharman, director general of
Britain's Defence Manufacturers Association (DMA), told AFP after
the signing in Sofia.


"But what is more important is to find Bulgarian partners to work
together because the labour cost in Bulgaria is cheaper," he
added.


Despite "a dramatic downsizing" of the defence industry in
Bulgaria since the fall of communism in 1989, the country still
has many highly educated engineers, Sharman said.


Bulgaria's Defence Minister Veselin Bliznakov said that
"Bulgarian companies have good capacity for the production of
light arms and ammunition."


In 2006, Bulgaria exported military equipment worth some 230
million dollars (173 million euros), according to industry data.


Asian and African nations were the main buyers of Bulgarian
weapons but smaller shipments were also made to the United
States, Canada, Japan and the European Union.


Before the fall of communism, Bulgaria's defence industry used to
employ some 115,000 people and its annual arms exports were worth
between 700 and 800 million dollars.


But the industry suffered a blow in the 1990s when it lost the
Warsaw Pact market as well as Arab and African countries hit by
international embargos.
