Australia were 96-2 after 20 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against the West Indies here on Tuesday.


Opener Matthew Hayden was on 32 with Michael Clarke on 13.


Captain Ricky Ponting had made a quickfire 35 off 36 balls before
he was run out by a brilliant throw from Ramnaresh Sarwan in the
covers in the 15th over.


Adam Gilchrist had been dismissed when he was caught by
wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin off Daren Powell for seven in the
fifth over.


Australia had struggled in the early conditions making just 10
off the first four overs with Hayden, who set a World Cup record
for the fastest century against South Africa on Saturday, having
to wait until the sixth over for his first run.


West Indies skipper Brian Lara won the toss and elected to field
in the first international match to be played at the new Sir
Vivian Richards Stadium.     The hosts made one change from their
eight-wicket win over Ireland at Sabina Park on Friday with Corey
Collymore's extra pace seeing him come in for Ian Bradshaw.


Australia were unchanged from the side that defeated South Africa
by 83 runs at Warner Park on Saturday.
