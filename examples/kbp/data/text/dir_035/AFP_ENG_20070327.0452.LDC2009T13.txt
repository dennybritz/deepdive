Ireland's South African-born coach Adrian Birrell is relishing
the World Cup Super Eights clash against Graeme Smith's Proteas
here on April 3.


The former Eastern Province coach is returning home after the
tournament, following four years in charge of the Ireland team
who have stunned the cricket world by making the second round of
the World Cup on their debut appearance.


"It's an amazing prospect. I'm South Africa's biggest fan, I've
coached a few of the players in that squad and for me to coach a
side in the World Cup against them is a big honour," Birrell told
the BBC.


"I do hope they win the tournament if Ireland don't, it's going
to be an incredible experience and I'm really looking forward to
that game."


Ireland, who defeated former champions Pakistan in the first
round, open their Super Eights programme against England here on
Friday.


Birrell hopes to have captain Trent Johnston back after a
shoulder injury and said: "It's a dream to play them in a World
Cup - who would have thought it would happen a few weeks ago.


"They have their own problems but are a tremendously good side
and have shown they can bounce back from a series of defeats in
Australia. It will be challenge but we look forward to it and
relish the opportunity."
