Gunmen on a motorbike hurled grenades and opened fire on an army
vehicle in a Pakistani tribal area Tuesday, killing five members
of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, officials said.


The attack happened in the rugged Bajaur region bordering
Afghanistan, where Pakistan authorities and tribesmen had just
Monday signed a peace deal with Taliban militants.


A major and an assistant director of the military-run ISI were
killed in the attack, along with two other ISI officials and
their driver, security officials told AFP on condition of
anonymity.
