The US ambasador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, who is the White
House's nominee as ambassador to the United Nations, left the
country after a 21-month posting, the embassy said Tuesday.


"The ambassador left Iraq last night at 9:00 pm (1800 GMT),"
embassy spokesman Lou Fintor told AFP.


Khalilzad, 55, a native of Afghanistan and a Sunni Muslim, has
served in Iraq since June 2005 and played a key role in
negotiations over the new Iraqi constitution and the formation of
the governing coalition.


If approved by the US Senate for the UN post, he will replace the
controversial John Bolton, who resigned the post in December
after failing to secure necessary Congressional endorsement.


Like Bolton, Khalilzad is often spoken of as being close to the
influential neo- conservative school of US foreign policy, whose
proponents are credited with the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq.
