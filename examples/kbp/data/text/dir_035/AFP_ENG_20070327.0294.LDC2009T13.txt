Police on Tuesday detained a Ukrainian coach after he allegedly
assaulted his daughter, a swimmer at the world championships,
following footage of the incident on local television.


The 38-year-old has had his accreditation revoked and the pair
are being interviewed by Victorian state police.


Footage captured by host broadcaster the Nine Network showed a
physical altercation between the two in the marshalling rooms at
the competition venue, with both attempting to strike each other.


It concluded with the father attempting to comfort the swimmer by
embracing her on the floor.


The organisers of the championships released a statement which
said: "Victoria police and FINA has been made aware of an alleged
incident that was broadcast on Channel Nine news this evening.


"The tape is currently being reviewed by Victoria police."


It is the second incident to strike the world championships this
week after a Russian diving coach earlier Tuesday pleaded not
guilty to indecent assault in Melbourne Magistrates Court.


Vladimir Rulev, 56, is accused of groping a hotel security guard
on the breast in a drunken incident.


His lawyer said the coach would fight the charge in court next
Monday.
