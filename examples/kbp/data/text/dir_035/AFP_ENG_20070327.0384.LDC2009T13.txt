A Copenhagen court on Tuesday acquitted two members of the Danish
Muslim association Al-Aqsa accused of financing two charities
linked to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.


Palestinian Rachid Mohamad Issa, who heads the association, and
cashier Ahmad Mohamad Suleiman, a Dane of Palestinian origin,
were indicted in December 2005.


It was the first time an organisation and its members had been
charged under Denmark's new anti-terror legislation adopted in
2002. Denmark's national prosecutor for special economic crimes
began investigating the Danish group shortly afterwards.


The Copenhagen district court acquitted the two and rejected
numerous Israeli documents, presented by the prosecution.


The prosecution was unable to provide a witness from Israel to
support the accusations in the documents which the Israeli
authorities said they had seized as proof that Al-Aqsa was
financing terrorist activities..


Judges sided with the defence, ruling that the documents provided
by Israel were copies and that it was unclear how Israeli
authorities had obtained them.


Police had confiscated between 250,000 and 1.2 million kroner
(between 33,000 and 161,000 euros, 45,000 and 215,000 dollars)
from Al-Aqsa's bank accounts in Copenhagen.
