Four people were shot dead Tuesday in attacks by suspected
Islamic separatists in Thailand's Muslim-majority south, police
said.


A 23-year-old Muslim man was shot dead at his home in the Bannang
Sata district of Yala province, an area under a military curfew
imposed to curb the violence, police said.


In nearby Pattani province, a 28-year-old Buddhist electrician
was killed when gunmen opened fire on a building where he was
working, police said.


Two Buddhist sisters, aged 46 and 43, were killed in a drive-by
shooting as they rode their motorcycle past a mosque in
Narathiwat province, police added.


More than 2,000 people have been killed since separatist violence
erupted three years ago in Thailand's Muslim-majority provinces
along the southern border with Malaysia.


The violence has worsened since a military coup in Bangkok six
months ago, despite a series of peace initiatives by the army-
installed government.
