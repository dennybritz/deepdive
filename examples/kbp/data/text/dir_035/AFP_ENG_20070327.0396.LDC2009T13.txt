The United States has posted a five-million dollar reward for the
capture of a Malaysian terror suspect wanted for several bomb
attacks in the Philippines, the State Department said Tuesday.


"Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has authorized a new reward
of up to five million dollars for information leading to the
arrest or conviction of Zulkifli bin Hir (a.k.a. Marwan)," the
State Department said in a statement.
