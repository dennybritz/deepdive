Clashes in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital last week
left between 200 and 500 dead, the German ambassador said Tuesday
as European Union envoys expressed concern at the "premature" use
of force by government troops.


The figure came from hospital sources, aid groups and diplomats,
the envoy, Karl-Albrecht Wokalek, told a press conference given
by 14 EU ambassadors.


Government troops fought fighters loyal to former vice president
Jean-Pierre Bemba in Kinshasa on Thursday and Friday and scores
of civilians were among the victims.


The Caritas aid group had previously given an estimate of about
150 dead while the last government toll spoke of 60 dead.
