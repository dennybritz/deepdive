Delta Air Lines said Tuesday it expects to emerge from bankruptcy
protection by April 30, and would be able to post a profit on an
operating basis for 2007.


In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
number three US carrier said it expects a pretax profit
restructuring charge of 816 million dollars for the year,
compared with a loss of 452 million in 2005.


Delta said it expects a resumption of trading in its shares in
early May.


Up to now, the Atlanta, Georgia-based airline had indicated it
would exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May.


Delta filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005, the
same day as rival Northwest Airlines, as US carriers faced
heightened woes from high fuel costs and the slump in air travel
since the attacks of September 11, 2001.


Delta, which recently rebuffed a takeover offer from US Airways,
said its fourth-quarter net loss amounted to 2.0 billion dollars
compared with a loss of 1.2 billion dollars in the same quarter
of 2005.


However, Delta also reported a full-year operating profit of 58
million dollars, saying this was a 2.1-billion-dollar improvement
from 2005 and its first annual operating profit since 2000.


Delta said in its SEC filing it has lost a total of 7.5 billion
dollars since 2001, but that it has made significant cost savings
to put it back on track toward profitability.
