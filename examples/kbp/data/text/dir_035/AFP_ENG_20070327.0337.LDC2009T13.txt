The International Athletics Federation on Tuesday awarded the
2011 world athletics championships to the South Korean city of
Daegu with Moscow holding the 2013 edition.


Daegu and Moscow had been candidates to hold both championships
along with Brisbane, Australia while Barcelona was a candidate
for the 2013 games.


The next world championships next summer will be in the Japanese
city of Osaka with Berlin hosting the global championships in
2009.


"We hope that the 2011 world championships in Korea will provide
an opportunity to promote athletics and to give us the
opportunity to build up athletic heroes which can bring in the
fans so that athletics as a whole can have a new growith in this
area," president of the Daegu bidding committee Yoo Chong-ha told
AFP.


"We want to show the International Athletics Federation and the
world that a country with an emerging background can help
athletics grow if it is given the opportunity to stand in the
middle of world attention."


Yoo said that the Daegu bid had drawn its inspiration from the
successful co- hosting with Japan of the 2002 World Cup football
finals when the home team reached the semi-finals.
