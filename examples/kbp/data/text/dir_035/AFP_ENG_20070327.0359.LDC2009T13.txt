Polish authorities said on Tuesday that they had smashed an
online child pornography ring, arresting 33 suspects in the
process.


Fifty computer hard drives and a haul of pornographic films were
seized during the nationwide bust, which involved 360 police
officers, Poland's justice and interior ministers told reporters.


"It was a huge network. There will be further developments in
this case," said Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro.


Ziobro also said that the government planned a new legislative
drive to boost the fight against paedophilia, although he did not
elaborate.


Last May, Polish police smashed a major Internet paedophile
network, detaining 10 people and seizing 300,000 photographs and
3,000 pornographic films.
