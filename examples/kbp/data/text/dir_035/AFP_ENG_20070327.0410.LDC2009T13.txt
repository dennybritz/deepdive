The boss of one of the Naples area's main mafia clans, Vincenzo
Di Lauro, was arrested early on Tuesday near the southern Italian
port, police and prosecutors said.


Di Lauro, 31, was arrested for "association with the mafia" in an
apartment in Casalnuovo, northeast of the southern Italian city.


He became head of the Di Lauro clan of the Camorran mafia after
his father Paolo was arrested in September 2005.


The older Di Lauro was considered one of Italy's 30 most wanted
criminals at the time.


The clan dominates drug trafficking in Naples' impoverished
Scampia and Secondigliano districts.


Attempts by some members to break away from the clan sparked
internecine battles that claimed some 130 lives in the Naples
area in 2004 and 2005.


"The capture of a fugitive of Di Lauro's calibre ... is of
capital importance," said Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti.


Vincenzo Di Lauro went into hiding in June 2006 after he was
released from prison on a technicality, according to the ANSA
news agency.


Several murders in the Naples area in recent weeks have been
linked to the Di Lauro clan.
