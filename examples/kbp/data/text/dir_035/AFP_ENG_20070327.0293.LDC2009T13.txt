A shouting protester interrupted a service to mark the 200th
anniversary of Britain's abolition of the slave trade, attended
by the Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Tony
Blair.


The man, who gave his name as Toyin Agbetu, 39, ran in front of
the altar of London's Westminster Abbey -- packed with
dignitaries for the occasion -- shouting "you should be ashamed"
and "this is an insult to us."


He was restrained by security guards and once outside the
demonstrator was led away by police in handcuffs.
