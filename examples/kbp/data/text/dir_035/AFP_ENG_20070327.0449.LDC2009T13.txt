Championship side Luton on Tuesday unveiled former Leeds boss
Kevin Blackwell as their new manager.


The 48-year-old, who was sacked by Leeds in September, replaces
Mike Newell  who was axed after criticising the sale of his best
players.


Blackwell's first game in charge will be a crucial trip to fellow
strugglers Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday.


Luton are second from bottom of the Championship - one place
above Leeds.


Blackwell made his name as a coach at Sheffield United after a
playing career as a goalkeeper with Scarborough, Huddersfield,
Torquay and Plymouth.
