The US Treasury's pointman on financial crime held a second day
of talks here in a bid to end a sanctions dispute that has held
up nuclear disarmament talks, his spokeswoman said Tuesday.


Daniel Glaser, the deputy assistant secretary for terrorist
financing and financial crimes, held talks with officials from
China's foreign ministry, the central bank and the country's
banking industry regulator, said spokeswoman Molly Millerwise.


Glaser had met with the Chinese the day before, following talks
Monday night with officials at the North Korean embassy.


Millerwise said the two sides discussed how to implement a deal
announced last week that would see 25 million dollars frozen in a
Macau bank due to accusations of money laundering and
counterfeiting returned to North Korea.


Glaser was joined in Tuesday's talks by US Ambassador to China
Sandy Randt, as well as Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei,
chair of the six-nation talks on dismantling North Korea's
nuclear weapons programme, Millerwise said.


She did not offer any other specifics about the meetings or say
when a resolution was likely.


However the chief US envoy to the six-nation talks, Christopher
Hill, said in Washington on Monday that he expected the issue to
be resolved in a couple of days.


The nuclear talks broke down last week after North Korea refused
to enter a new round of negotiations until the 25 million dollars
was safely returned.


The money was supposed to be transferred quickly to a North
Korean account with the Bank of China.


However the state-owned lender has reportedly refused to accept
the money for fear the transaction may hurt its credit rating.
