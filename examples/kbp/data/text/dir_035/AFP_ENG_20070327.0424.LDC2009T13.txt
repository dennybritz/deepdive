Ground personnel and flight attendants for Moroccan-Senegalese
airline Air Senegal International continued to strike for a
second day Tuesday over pay issues, the union said, bringing all
the companies flights to a halt.


"The strike will continue until tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. We
will push on for 24 hours if we do not have a draft agreement
signed by the chief executive" Mohamed el Yalaoui, union leader
Moustapha Diakhate told AFP.


Senegal's minister of tourism and air transport, "Ousmane Masseck
Ndiaye and the (company's) board of directors has asked the chief
executive to sign an agreement that we drafted together, but he
is waiting for the go-ahead from the Moroccan branch," Diakhate
said.


Air Senegal, started in 2001, is 51 percent owned by Royal Air
Maroc and the remainder is held by the Senegalese government.


"All the domestic and international flights were cancelled on
Monday, about a dozen, and it will be the same today," Diakhate
said.


The union has called for a new salary scale and the integration
of about 100 temporary workers.


The airline's pilots are not participating in the strike.
