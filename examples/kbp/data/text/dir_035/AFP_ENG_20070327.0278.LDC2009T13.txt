Spanish construction group Acciona said Tuesday that its planned
joint bid for Endesa would boost its underlying earnings by 187
percent this year.


Acciona and Italian energy group Enel said Monday they would
launch a bid for Endesa, in a challenge to German group E.ON,
which increased the terms of its offer on Monday, valuing Endesa
at 42.3 billion euros (56.5 billion dollars).


Acciona said the announced bid, if successful, would boost its
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by
187 percent this year, 180 percent in 2008 and 175 percent in
2009.


The figures appeared in a document the company provided to the
Spanish stock market authority CNMV.


Earnings per share would rise by 97 percent this year, 102
percent in 2008 and 100 percent in 2009.


Acciona said that the plan would "generate strong added value
from day one for shareholders in Acciona."


However, CNMV has baned Acciona and Enel from making a bid before
October, six months after the expected end of the offer by E.ON.
