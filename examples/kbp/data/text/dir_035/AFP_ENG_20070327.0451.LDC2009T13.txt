States that commit torture should be forced to pay for victims'
medical and psychological treatment, the UN Special Rapporteur on
Torture Manfred Nowak said on Tuesday.


"In reality, it's almost never the state that tortures, but other
states who provide asylum, who take victims of torture and who
are then providing in state institutions rehabilitation," the
Nowak told reporters.


The European Union is currently the biggest donor to torture
rehabilitation centres worldwide, with a contribution of 29
million dollars (22 million euros), followed by the UN Voluntary
Fund for Victims of Torture, which provided 17 million dollars in
2005-2006.


The largest donors to the United Nations fund are the United
States, Denmark and the Netherlands.


"My idea was, could we not devise certain mechanisms that
countries where torture is widespread or even systematic should
be held accountable to pay," Nowak said.


Such states could then even try to pass the bill on to the
individual torturers, he added.


"If individual torturers would have to pay all the long term
rehabilitation costs, this would have a much stronger deterrent
effect on torture than some kind of disciplinary or lenient
criminal punishment," the special rapporteur said.


Nowak was speaking to the press after having addressed the UN
Human Rights Council, which is holding its fourth session here in
Geneva.
