A crucial meeting of Zimbabwe's ruling party, which was to have
discussed plans to extend veteran President Robert Mugabe's
tenure, has been postponed to the end of the week, a party
official said.


The central committee of the Zimbabwe African National Union -
Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) had been expected to meet on Friday but
the meeting has been put back for Mugabe's return from a hastily-
arranged regional summit in Tanzania.


"All I can say is that the central committee is meeting in Harare
on Friday," ZANU-PF spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira said.


Shamuyarira did however confirm that a meeting of the party's
political bureau would take place on Wednesday although he would
not say the purpose of the meeting.


Friday's gathering of the central committee will be the first
since the party conference in December when proposals to extend
Mugabe's term from 2008 until 2010, ostensibly in order to have
simultaneous presidential and parliamentary polls, were given the
green light.


The proposals however have since met with opposition from other
party elders and Mugabe already appears to have abandoned the
idea of an extension, urging his supporters last week to gear up
for elections next year.


The 83-year-old, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in
1980 from Britain, had previously indicated he would step down at
the end of his current term next year.


But he made an about face last year, insisting that he would stay
put if his party was in danger of falling apart.
