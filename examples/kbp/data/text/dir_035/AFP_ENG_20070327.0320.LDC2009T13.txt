France captain Guy Forget has selected Richard Gasquet and Paul-
Henri Mathieu for the singles matches in next month's Davis Cup
quarter-final against holders Russia.


Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra will play the doubles in the
Moscow tie from April 6 to 8 and a fifth player is yet to be
selected, a French tennis federation statement added.


Gasquet earned his place as the French number one and Mathieu
took the second singles spot ahead of Sebastien Grosjean, whose
experience was deemed not sufficient to outweigh his declining
ranking.


Llodra and Clement were retained as they have twice beaten the
expected Russian pairing, though they lost their match against
Romania in the World Group first round.


France meet Russia in the quarter-finals for the third
consecutive year having lost the last two matches.
