Russian aluminium producers Rusal and Sual together with
Switzerland's Glencore said on Tuesday that they had merged to
form the world's number one aluminium producer.


The new entity will be 66-percent owned by Rusal's shareholders,

Called United Company Rusal, it is to be headed by former Rusal
chief executive Alexander Bulygin, with the role of non-executive
chairman given to former Sual chairman Viktor Vekselberg, the new

Under the deal, former Rusal chairman Oleg Deripaska becomes the
new group's main shareholder.


"The new company has pro forma sales of approximately 12 billion
dollars (nine billion euros). The group's production capacity
totals approximately four million tonnes of aluminium and one
million tonnes of alumina," the statement said.


"Our goal is to become an international metals and energy
corporation providing leadership in new areas of business," it
quoted Bulygin as saying.


The tie-up, one of the biggest in Russian corporate history,

regulators and from European Union competition authorities.


The combined company "combines four bauxite mines, 10 alumina
refineries, 14 aluminium smelters and three foil mills. The
company's assets and over 100,000 employees are located in 17
countries across five continents," the statement added.
