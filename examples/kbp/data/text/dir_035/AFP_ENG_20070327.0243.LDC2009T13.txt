London Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 5 will make the airport
the world's greatest air hub, chief executive Tony Douglas
claimed on Tuesday, exactly a year before the opening.


The terminal, which cost 4.3 billion pounds (8.4 billion dollars,
6.3 billion euros), will be a new home for carrier British
Airways and serve 30 million passengers a year.


Heathrow, west of the city centre, is the world's busiest
international airport.


The first flight to use the new terminal will be a BA service
from Hong Kong and about 40,000 travellers will pass through the
building on its opening day.


"London is a world city, a global financial centre and needs a
world-class airport," Douglas said.


"There is still much to do, but we're confident we are on track
to deliver a world-class experience that Heathrow's passengers
deserve."


Douglas said 68 million passengers would travel this year through
terminals designed to cope with about 45 million people.


"By 2012, we aim to have either re-built or redeveloped our
existing facilities and returned Heathrow to its rightful status
as the world's leading international airport," he said.


Terminal 5 is the biggest free standing building in Britain
measuring 40 metres high, 396 metres long and 176 metres wide.


Construction began in 2002.
