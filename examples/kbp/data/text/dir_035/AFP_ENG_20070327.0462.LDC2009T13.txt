The Finnish government on Tuesday boosted its 2007 growth
forecast by a percentage point to 3.1 percent but warned that the
current expansion was nearing an end.


The government maintained its 2.7 percent projection for 2008,
the lower end of a growth range of 2.7-3.0 percent issued by the
finance ministry in December.


The ministry added that the expansion cycle had reached its peak
near the end of 2006 and warned that slower growth in labor
supply had raised fears of an increase in salaries that could
drive up production costs and aggravate inflation.


Unemployment is seen as falling to 7.1 percent of the work force
this year and 6.7 percent in 2008.


Finnish growth came to 5.5 percent in 2006 after 2.9 percent in
2005 and 3.6 percent in 2004.


The country's economic performance in the last 10 years has been
among the healthiest in the Europe, eclipsed in the eurozone only
by Ireland, Luxembourg and Greece.
