EU finance ministers unanimously backed plans on Tuesday to
create a single European payments market, which should allow
consumers to make big savings on cross-border payments.


"This is practical progress on the way to integration of
financial markets in Europe," German Finance Minister Peer
Steinbrueck told colleagues at a meeting he chaired in Brussels.


The plans aim to make cross-border payments by credit card, debit
card, electronic bank transfer, direct debit or other means as
easy, cheap and secure as payments in a single EU country.


The European Union is currently covered by a patchwork of
national payment rules which can lead to wide variations between
the prices charged for payment services.


For example, a bank transfer that is free in one EU country can
cost more that 10 euros in another member.


The European Union's executive arm has calculated the annual cost
of making payments between these fragmented national systems is
two to three percent of gross domestic product and that the
shake-up could save EU consumers 50-100 billion euros per year.


The new rules are expected to go before the European Parliament
in April for a second reading.
