Official figures on the 17-year-old revolt in Indian Kashmir have
revealed the region has lost four years of business due to
repeated strikes, police said Tuesday.


According to the latest statistics on the conflict being released
this week, Islamic militants and Muslim separatists have called a
total of 1,463 general strikes in the Kashmir valley around
Srinagar since the insurgency began in 1989.


Separatists, however, immediately jumped to the defence of their
tactic of forcing businesses to close up.


"Strikes are the only peaceful means to convey our point to the
international community," said Javed Mir, a former rebel
commander and now a separatist political leader.


Strikes are regularly called to register protests against India
on important national holidays like Independence and Republic Day
-- branded by the rebels as "black days".


They are also held to mark specific events, such as the killing
of militants or the regular allegations of abuses by Indian
troops guarding their part of the disputed region.


Business owners in the region usually have little choice but to
adhere to the strike calls.


Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have fought two of their
three wars over Kashmir, and in 1999 fought a two-month pitched
battle in the peaks of Kargil, a northeastern sector of Indian
Kashmir.


According to figures released on Monday, the insurgency in Indian
Kashmir has left 42,147 people dead, more than a third of them
civilians. Militants say the toll is far higher.
