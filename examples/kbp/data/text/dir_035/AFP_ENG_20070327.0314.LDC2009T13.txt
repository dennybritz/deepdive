Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai launched a new
attack on veteran President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday, branding
him a dictator who needed psychiatric help.


"We don't hate Mugabe. In fact, I think he needs psychiatric
help," Movement for Democratic Change leader Tsvangirai said at
his first public address since he was arrested and then assaulted
while trying to attend a rally on March 11.


"We must remember the scriptures which state that 'forgive them
for they know not what they are doing,'" he said at a memorial
service held at a church in commemoration of MDC activist Gift
Tandare, who was shot on the same day.


With his right eye still bloodshot, Tsvangirai told the service
attended by more than 500 people in Harare's upmarket suburb of
Borrowdale, that the opposition was determined to restore
democracy.


"We are not talking of overthrow of a government, as Zimbabweans
we have a constitutional ... right to deserve democracy," he told
the crowd which included diplomats from Australia, Britain,
Germany and the American embassies in Harare.


"There is no dictator in this world who has succeeded to oppress
the people forever."


Mugabe has accused the MDC of serving as puppets of Western
governments which imposed sanctions over accusations that Mugabe
rigged the 2002 presidential election when he defeated
Tsvangirai.


Dozens of other MDC supporters were also assaulted while in
custody after the March 11 rally was crushed.
