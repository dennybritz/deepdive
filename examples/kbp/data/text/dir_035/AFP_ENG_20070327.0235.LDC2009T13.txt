A tropical worm disease that has plagued people since ancient
times could be just two years away from eradication, the World
Health Organisation said on Tuesday.


Guinea worm disease, or dracunculiasis, now only affects around
25,000 people in nine countries, down from an estimated 3.0
million cases in over 20 countries in the early 1980s, the WHO
said in a statement.


"This is the culmination of years of efforts by local and
international groups to see this disease eradicated," said
Lorenzo Savioli, director of Neglected Tropical Diseases at the
WHO.


Twelve countries were declared Guinea worm-free in early March,
and if progress continues at this rate, the disease could be
utterly eradicated in less than two years, the agency said.


The disease is still endemic in certain villages in sub-Saharan
Africa, it noted.


The worm is spread through contaminated water, with victims
developing crippling ulcers, sometimes the size of tennis balls.


The pain is such that people feel they are on fire, so they jump
into water -- at which point the worm releases thousands of
larvae and the water itself becomes contaminated.


The disease has existed for generations and was found in Egyptian
mummies. It is thought to be the "fiery serpent" often referred
to in texts from ancient Egypt and Assyrian Mesopotamia.
