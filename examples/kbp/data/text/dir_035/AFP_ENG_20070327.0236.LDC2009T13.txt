The National Bank of Slovakia decided on Tuesday to cut its key
interest rate by a quarter of a point to 4.5 percent, spokeswoman
Jana Kovacova announced.


The bank also cut its one-day refinancing rate by a quarter of a
point to 6.0 percent and its one day sterilisation rate by 0.75
of a percentage point to 2.5 percent.


The changes will take effect from Wednesday, the bank added.


The cuts follow a recent strenghthening of the Slovak koruna
fuelled by strong growth of the economy which expanded by 8.3
percent in 2006.


They follow a decision last week to revalue to the central rate
of the koruna against the euro within the Exchange Rate Mechanism
II (ERM II).


The koruna's central rate was lowered to 35.4424 from 38.4550,
the rate set in November 2005 when the koruna joined the
mechanism allowing its currency to fluctuate within a narrow band
against the single European currency.


The bank last altered its key interest rate on September 26, 2006
when it announced a 0.25-percentage point rise.
