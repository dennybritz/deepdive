In the regional wage talks for the engineering and metal-working
sector in south-west Germany, employers said on Tuesday that they
were offering wage increases of 3.0 percent to the 800,000 metal
workers in the region.


The regional employers' federation Suedwestmetall said in a
statement that the offer of 3.0 percent entailed an underlying
wage rise of 2.5 percent, plus a one-off "economic bonus" of an
additional 0.5 percent over a period of 12 months.


The pay talks in the German engineering and metal-working sectors
are conducted on a regional basis. And it was the first time that
a concrete offer has been put on the table from the employers'
side.


The powerful IG Metall union is demanding a pay increase of 6.5
percent for all 3.4 million workers around the country. And the
union rejects any suggestion that this year's deal should include
a one-off bonus.
