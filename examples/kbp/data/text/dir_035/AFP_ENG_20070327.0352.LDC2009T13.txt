Wall Street shares swung lower at the opening Tuesday as
investors remained skittish about the state of the US housing
market and eyed increasing tensions between Iran and the West.


In opening trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 48.14
points (0.39 percent) to 12,420.93 and the Nasdaq composite lost
9.11 points (0.37 percent) to 2,446.52.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 dropped 6.33 points
(0.44 percent) to 1,431.17.


The market was still absorbing a weak report on new US home sales
a day earlier that sparked concerns that the real estate market
has not yet hit bottom.


Additionally, the tensions over Iran's nuclear program also kept
investors cautious, since it has pushed oil prices to fresh 2007
highs.


"Concern is growing that Iran may blockade the Bay of Hormuz
which would push oil prices up big," said Al Goldman at AG
Edwards. "This must be watched."
