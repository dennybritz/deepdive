Indonesia agreed on Tuesday to resume sharing bird flu virus
samples with the World Health Organisation for tests aimed at
fighting the disease.


"We are going to send the virus samples immediately," said Health
Minister Siti Fadilah Supari.


The breakthrough came at a WHO meeting here after the world body
agreed to develop a new mechanism on sample-sharing that would be
fairer for poorer nations, the minister said.


"This is now more fair and transparent. The WHO will improve the
mechanism," she said.


Indonesia said in February that it had stopped sending samples to
WHO reference laboratories because it was worried drugs firms
would exploit them to develop costly vaccines.


The move raised questions about a 50-year-old system of sample-
sharing said to be key to fighting human flu.


The minister said under the new mechanism, drugs firms would have
to negotiate with the country producing the sample.


The WHO says the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has infected 281
people and killed 169 of them, mostly in Southeast Asia.


Scientists worry the H5N1 strain could mutate into a form easily
spread among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the
potential to kill millions.
