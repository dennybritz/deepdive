Former Argentine president Isabel Peron on Tuesday formally
refuted one of two pending extradition cases seeking her return
on charges of alleged rights abuses during her term in office.


Peron, who has lived in Spain since 1981, replied in the negative
when asked by a judge in Spain's highest court whether she
accepted the Argentine extradition demand.


The case in question concerns the kidnapping and disappearance of
activist Hector Fagetti Gallego, who was arrested one month
before the March 1976 military coup that ousted her from power.


The second extradition request is linked to crimes allegedly
committed by a right-wing death squad during her 1974-1976 rule,
which followed the death of her husband, president Juan Domingo
Peron.


If the court rules in favour of extradition, the final decision
will rest with the Spanish government.
