Three people were killed when angry fans went on the rampage
during a Nigerian league game played at the weekend, officials
have disclosed.


"Policemen attached to Enyimba shot dead three fans," said top
Akwa Ibom State sports official, Chris Ekong.


"The police came to the stadium with live bullets and opened fire
on fans when trouble began."


Fans went on the rampage when referee Felicia Okwugba awarded a
penalty in the dying minutes of a Premier League match involving
host team Akwa United and Enyimba with Akwa United leading 2-1.


They manhandled the referee forcing the policemen attached to
Enyimba to open fire on them. They also set ablaze several
vehicles parked at the stadium premises and clashed with police.


On Monday, angry youths took to the streets destroying property
and looking to hunt down people from the eastern part of Nigeria,
where Enyimba are based.


The Nigerian Football League (NFL) has since banned the Uyo
Township Stadium where the match was played while Akwa United
have been banished to Minna, northcentral Nigeria.


A special three-man probe panel has also been set up by the NFL
to fully investigate the fracas.
