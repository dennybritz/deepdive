Nineteen Chinese nationals have been arrested in waters off
Malaysia's eastern Sabah state with an illegal catch of more than
70 protected turtles, most of them dead, police said Tuesday.


Except for five turtles left alive, the rest of the 78 Greenback
and Hawksbill turtles had been killed and preserved by the
Chinese men from southern Hainan province, police said.


"We have detained 19 crew, Chinese nationals from Hainan, China,"
said assistant marine police superintendent Husaini Zainal Abidin
from Sabah's capital, Kota Kinabalu.


"We also seized about 78 turtles, and out of the 78, five were
alive," he told AFP.


Husaini said marine police made the arrest after encountering the
poachers in their China-registered wooden trawler on Monday.


"They tried to get away but our boat manged to detain them after
we gave them a warning," he said.


Husaini said finding the carcasses of the turtles was "very, very
sad".


"They confessed it ... We believe it's for food and maybe for
medicine," he said.


"We are handing them to the fisheries department and we are
charging them under the Fisheries Act. The offence is they
encroached on our national waters and were poaching the turtles,
which are protected species," he said.


The captain of the vessel faced a fine of one million ringgit
(289,813 dollars) and each of the crew 100,000 ringgit or up to
five years in jail, he said.


Turtles are hunted in Malaysia for their meat and shell, but many
die after getting entangled in fishing nets in open seas.


China is a major importer of turtles from Asia for food and
medicinal purposes and aggressive illegal poaching in Southeast
Asian countries has seen sea turtle numbers falling.
