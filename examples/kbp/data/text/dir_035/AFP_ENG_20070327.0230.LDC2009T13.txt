Hong Kong police Tuesday offered a reward of a million Hong Kong
(128,000 US) dollars for information on four men in connection
with mysterious devices buried under turf at a city racecourse.


They said the money had been offered by the Hong Kong Jockey Club
for information on the four Chinese men, who had been placed at
the track days before the discovery.


A complex interconnected system of devices comprising tiny
liquid-filled darts connected to a compressed-air propulsion
system was found near one of the starting lines of the Happy
Valley race track.


The devices were buried in the turf and camouflaged with green
tape.


Police would not speculate on what the devices were intended for,
but said they would have caused harm to horses and jockeys if
activated.


Media speculation has been rife with suggestions that the system
was laid by race fixers to nobble horses.


A police statement issued Tuesday said inquiries had revealed
four Chinese men had appeared at the starting line on the evening
of March 19 and in the small hours of March 21. The device was
discovered at about 9.30am (0130 GMT) on March 21.


Police would not say if the men had been seen by witnesses or
picked up by closed-circuit TV, the footage from which officers
have been busy scanning.


The discovery sparked huge interest in Hong Kong, where racing is
the premier sport and billions of dollars are gambled every week.
