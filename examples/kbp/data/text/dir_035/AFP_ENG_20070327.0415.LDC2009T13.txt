A Bosnian court was gentle on a man found guilty for a series of
bomb attacks earlier this year after he confessed and said he was
motivated by love.


"I think that the judge has taken into account Mladen Kragulj's
confession, regret and motive in deciding the sentence," defence
lawyer Dragan Barbaric told AFP.


Kragulj, 54, was sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined some
2,000 euros (2,700 dollars) for planting five explosive devices
in the southern town of Mostar in January.


The blasts, which occurred in the vicinity of the Majestic
restaurant over a four-day period, caused damage to surrounding
buildings and vehicles. Nobody was hurt.


Upon being arrested, Kragulj said he planted the bombs to prove
to his long-time girlfriend that Mostar was dangerous and that
she should return to their hometown of Prijedor, in the country's
northwest.


Kragulj's girlfriend, whose identity was not revealed, had moved
to Mostar after getting a waitressing job in the Majestic. She
has since accepted his request to get married, local newspapers
reported.


Mostar saw fierce fighting between its Muslim and Croat
communities during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war. Almost 12 years on,
the town still bears the scars of the conflict.
