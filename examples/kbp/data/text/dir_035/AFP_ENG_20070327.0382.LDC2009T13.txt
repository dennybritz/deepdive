A Greek football fan had chunks bitten out of his ears following
his side's defeat to Turkey at the weekend, private Mega TV
reported on Tuesday.


The cafe owner on the island of Crete was accosted by two
Bulgarians in an incident similar to US boxer Mike Tyson's attack
on Evander Holyfield a decade ago. The fan was hospitalised with
missing ear chunks.


He told the station that the Bulgarians, who were watching the
game in his cafe and noisily celebrated every goal scored against
Greece, assaulted him after he told them to shut up.


The alleged attackers have been arrested. Greece were stunned at
home by Turkey on Saturday in a qualifying game for the 2008
European Championships, losing 1-4.
