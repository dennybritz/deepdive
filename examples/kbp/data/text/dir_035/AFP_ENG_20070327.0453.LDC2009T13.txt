A suicide truck bomb and a separate car bombing killed 30 people
and wounded another 50 on Tuesday in Iraq's northern town of Tal
Afar, a hospital doctor said.


Bodies and wounded civilians were brought to hospital following
the two blasts, which comes just three days after a marketplace
suicide attack killed 10 people in the same town.


Soldiers waved the suicide bomber through into the Al-Wahaeda
district of Tal Afar when they saw it was laden with food
supplies following a one-week shortage. The bomber then blew up
the vehicle, said Doctor Ali Abboud.


No details were immediately available on the car bombing.


US President George W. Bush last year held up Tal Afar as a model
for coalition efforts to create a stable Iraq.
