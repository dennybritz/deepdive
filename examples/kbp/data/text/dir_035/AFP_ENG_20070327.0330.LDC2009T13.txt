Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday flew in for the Arab
summit to a traditional embrace from Saudi King Abdullah in their
first contact since relations chilled after last year's Lebanon
war.


Assad was in Riyadh along with other Arab leaders afor the summit
which opens on Wednesday.


In a speech last August, Assad said the Israel-Hezbollah war had
"exposed the Arab situation entirely... because it has downed the
people of half positions, or the half men, and brought down all
the tardy positions".


Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal had implicitly
blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah, backed by Damascus and Tehran, for
the devastation wrought by the war which broke out after the
group captured two Israeli soldiers.


Regional newspapers said Assad was criticising the leaders of
pro-US Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, but Syrian Foreign
Minister Walid Muallem said the president was not referring to
any Arab leader.
