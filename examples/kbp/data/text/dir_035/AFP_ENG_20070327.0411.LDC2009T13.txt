The father and coach of top ranked Czech tennis player Nicole
Vaidisova, Ales Kodat, was named non-playing captain of the
country's Fed Cup team on Tuesday, the Czech agency CTK reported.


Kodat, 40, will lead the Czech team, likely to include his
daughter who is ranked eighth worldwide, against neighbours
Slovakia for their World Group II first round clash on April
21-22 in Bratislava.


Kodat replaces Tomas Petera, who stepped down after two years to
help  Prague's bid to host the summer Olympic games in 2016.
