Japan's ruling parties Tuesday approved legislation to extend an
air force mission supporting US-led operations in Iraq for two
years.


The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner New
Komeito separately approved the bill, which would be referred to
the Cabinet for its approval in the near future, a policy
official from New Komeito said.


The bill, if approved, would extend by two years the Japanese
mission beyond its July 31 deadline.


Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wants Japan to take a more
assertive role in global security affairs, has repeatedly vowed
to push through the bill.


But a poll published last week by the liberal Asahi Shimbun
showed that a mere 19 percent of the public approved extending
the mission, while 69 percent were opposed.


Japan, a close US ally, last year ended its landmark deployment
of troops in Iraq on a reconstruction mission. The mission marked
the first time since World War II that Japan had sent troops to a
country where fighting is underway.


Despite the withdrawal, Japan continues to station the 210 air
force personnel in Kuwait to fly people and supplies into Iraq.
