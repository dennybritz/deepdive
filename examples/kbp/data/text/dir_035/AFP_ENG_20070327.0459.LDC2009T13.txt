White House spokesman Tony Snow was been diagnosed with a
recurrence of cancer which has spread, deputy spokeswoman Dana
Perino said Tuesday.


Snow, 51, who survived a bout with colon cancer in 2005, had
surgery Monday to remove a growth in his abdomen.


"I've just spoken to him but unfortunately the growth was
cancerous, there has been some metastasis," Perino said.


Perino said Snow declined to give further specifics until he
decides on a course of treatment, but added that he was "in very
good spirits."


"He spoke with the president this morning. He is in consultations
with his doctors on chemotherapy treatments," she said.


She said he intends to be "going after it as aggressively as he
can" and that he will "beat it again."


Bush appeared before reporters to express his support for his
spokesman.


"Obviously, a lot of folks here in the White House worry a lot
about their friend, as do Laura and I," he said, referring to his
wife.


"And so my message to Tony is, stay strong; a lot of people love
you and care for you and will pray for you.  And we're hoping for
all the best."


"In the meantime, I hope our fellow citizens offer a prayer to he
and his family," the president said.


Snow was the second high-profile political figure to announce a
recurrence of cancer in a week. On Thursday, the wife of
Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards, Elizabeth Edwards,
said her breast cancer had spread to her bones and could not be
cured.
