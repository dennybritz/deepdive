An Internet blogger in new EU member state Lithuania vowed
Tuesday to fight a parliamentary decision refusing him
accreditation on the grounds that he was not a legitimate
journalist.


"This decision does not allow me to enjoy the rights and
protection other journalists are entitled to," Liutauras
Ulevicius, author of the www.blogas.lt/liutauras, said.


Parliament rejected his application for accreditation, saying he
and other bloggers do not meet the legal definition of a
journalist.


"The Media Law describes a journalist as a person who collects,
disseminates and provides information to the media, based on a
contract with the media, or who is a member of a journalists'
union," parliament's education, science and culture committee
said.


Ulevicius told AFP the decision breached his right to self-
expression.


He vowed to appeal in the first instance to parliamentary
administrators.


"If this does not help, I shall defend my rights in court,"
Ulevicius said.
