British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett cut short a visit to
Turkey after a telephone conversation with her Iranian
counterpart over 15 sailors detained by Iran, a Turkish diplomat
said on Tuesday.


"We were informed that she cancelled the Istanbul leg of her trip
(on Wednesday) after she spoke over the telephone with the
Iranian foreign minister," the diplomat told AFP.


The diplomat said the call was related to the 15 naval personnel
detained by Iran.


Beckett was expected to fly to Britain on Tuesday evening after a
meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, another
diplomat said.


She had been originally scheduled to wrap up her visit on
Wednesday after talks with Turkish Economy Minister Ali Babacan
in Istanbul.


Officials from the British embassy were not immediately available
for comment.
