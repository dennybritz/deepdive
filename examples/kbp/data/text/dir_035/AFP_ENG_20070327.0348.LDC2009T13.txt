West Indies captain Brian Lara won the toss and elected to field
in the opening match of the Super Eight phase of the World Cup at
the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium here Tuesday.


Both hosts West Indies and reigning champions Australia won all
three of their matches in the group stage.


West Indies made one change from their eight-wicket win over
Ireland at Sabina Park on Friday with Corey Collymore's extra
pace seeing him come in for Ian Bradshaw.


Australia were unchanged from the side that defeated South Africa
by 83 runs at Warner Park on Saturday.


This was the first match played at this ground, built specially
for the World Cup.


Conditions were overcast following early morning rain with the
pitch an unknown quantity. But the cloudy skies may have prompted
Lara to bowl first with temperatures still humid.
