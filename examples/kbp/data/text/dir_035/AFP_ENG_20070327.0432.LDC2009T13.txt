Arsenal and Chelsea have been slapped with a 100,000-pound fine
each by the Football Association for the behaviour of players and
backroom staff near the end of the League Cup final a month ago.


The melee at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on February 25 was
sparked following a confrontation between Chelsea's Jon Obi Mikel
and Arsenal captain Kolo Toure, with players and coaches from
both sides becoming involved.


Both players were dismissed, alongside Arsenal's Togo
international striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who confronted referee
Howard Webb and refused to immediately leave the pitch.


The FA's disciplinary commission on Tuesday stated that they
viewed the incident as "serious, unacceptable and damaging to the
image of the game."


However, they took into consideration the guilty pleas and the
mitigation put forward by both Premiership clubs, following
Chelsea's 2-1 success.


The commission found that Arsenal players had been "marginally
more involved in the incident, but that Chelsea had past proven
cases in recent years regarding the general behaviour of their
players where warnings had been issued."
