Who's saying what at the World Cup:


"It seems highly unlikely that a Jamaican has just walked off the
street, gone up to the 12th floor of the hotel in a secure lift,
gone along to his room, got in without any sign of forced entry,
murdered him and never stole anything at all. It seems unlikely
but we must keep an open mind on what may come up in the future."


- Jamaican police deputy commissioner Mark Shields on the hunt
for the killer of Bob Woolmer.


"He is Sri Lanka's massive weapon and the way we cope with him is
going to be important. We have played against Murali quite a lot
now. It still doesn't make it easy to face him. He's a world-
class bowler."


- South Africa skipper Graeme Smith on the threat posed by
Muttiah Muralitharan when his team meets Sri Lanka in Guyana on
Wednesday


"We win pretty well at home and we have that ruthless instinct,
but we never seemed to have that kind of edge when we travelled.
Over the last 15-16 months, we have developed that."


- Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene on the reasons for his
team's improvements


"We are all disappointed but I can promise you there will be no
knee-jerk reaction."


- India board member Inderjit Bindra on the refusal to panic over
the team's shock World Cup elimination.


"We've got a couple of more experienced players, but the vast
majority of them are under 25, which is absolutely perfect for an
emerging team like us."


- Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore.
