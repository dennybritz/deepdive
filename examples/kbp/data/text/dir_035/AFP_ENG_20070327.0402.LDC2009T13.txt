Moscow urged Iran on Tuesday to give an "adequate reaction" to
new UN sanctions over its controversial nuclear programme.


"We hope for an adequate reaction from the Iranian leadership to
the signals given with this (Security Council) resolution,"
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said following a meeting
with his Montenegrin counterpart Milan Rocen.


"This resolution should contribute to a revival of negotiations
and is not meant to punish Iran at all," Lavrov said , calling on
Teheran to re-launch negotiations with the international
community.


The UN Security Council imposed new sanctions against Iran on
Saturday over its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment, which it
insists is for peaceful energy purposes but which the
international community fears could be used to make nuclear
weapons.


Iran responded to the resolution Sunday by saying it would push
ahead with its enrichment programme and would limit cooperation
with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
