Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said in Riyadh on Tuesday
that a revived Arab initiative is the best chance for Middle East
peace in the near future.


"If this initiative is destroyed, I do not believe that a better
chance for peace will present itself in the near future," Abbas
told AFP.


He spoke shortly after arriving in the Saudi capital on the eve
of a two-day summit of the Arab League that plans to revive a
Saudi proposal for Israeli-Arab peace that was first made five
years ago.
