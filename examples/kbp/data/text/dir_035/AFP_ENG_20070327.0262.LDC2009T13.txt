Italy's Frederica Pellegrini shocked even herself Tuesday by
storming to a new world record in the semi-finals of the
200-metres freestyle.


Pellegrini broke German Franziska van Almsick's record which has
stood since 2002 with a new time of one minute 56.47 seconds.


She shaved 17-100ths of a second off van Almsick's mark to shock
even herself ahead of Wednesday's final.


"Finally it has happened. I really can't believe it. I haven't
begun to understand it," Pellegrini said.


"When I started I wanted to have a good time, but really to have
done this - I never could have imagined.


"I really don't believe it. I never would have thought such a
thing would happen."


Pellegrini, second in the event at the 2005 Montreal world
titles, came with a storming finish to overhaul German Annika
Lurz, who had her eyes on her compatriot's world record.


The Italian swept over the last 50m in 29.73 to claim the record.


Pellegrini now goes into Wednesday's final the favourite to claim
Italy's first gold medal in the pool.


Lurz was second in the semi-final in 1:56.67 ahead of Poland's
European champion Otylia Jedrzejczak (1:57.19).


French star Laure Manaudou, third behind Jedrzejczak at last
year's European championships, was fifth fastest into the final
in 1:57.30 in her third race of the night.
