The UN food relief agency said Tuesday that it would from next
month halt food aid to some 50,000 people in Djibouti, including
thousands of malnourished children, due to a lack of funds.


"Malnutrition among children younger than five is in fact a
silent emergency in Djibouti but we just don't have the funds to
continue providing food for the most vulnerable," said World Food
Programme's country director for Djibouti, Benoit Thiry, in a
statement.


The WFP said it needed six million dollars (4.5 million euros)
for operations until December 2007, including one million
immediately to avoid stopping distributions from April, just
before the start of the dry season when many families face the
most severe food shortages.


It said it would otherwise have to stop delivering aid to more
than 47,000 pastoralist drought victims next month, and from May
would no longer be able to feed some 6,000 refugees who rely
entirely on food aid.


Over the past five years, a series of droughts have hit the
country with a tiny population of around 600,000.


The most severe was early last year, when rains failed
completely, and pastoralist families lost many or all of their
animals.


Located at the southern end of the Red Sea on the Gulf of Aden,
Djibouti is a key staging post between the Mediterranean and the
Suez Canal shipping route to the Indian Ocean.


It is home to the largest overseas French military base and the
only US military base in Africa.
