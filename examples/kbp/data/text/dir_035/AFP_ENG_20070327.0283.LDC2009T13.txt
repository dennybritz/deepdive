Chelsea have stepped up their bid to overtake Manchester United
and Liverpool as the top English football clubs in Asia by
launching a club website in Korean.


The site, http://kr.chelseafc.com, was launched in Seoul on
Tuesday and follows the agreement two years ago of a five-year
shirt-sponsorship accord with Korean electronics giant Samsung.


In January, Chelsea launched a Mandarin language website for
China and there are plans for further websites in other markets,
according to chief executive Peter Kenyon.


"Korea is very important to Chelsea, especially because of our
partnership with Samsung," Kenyon said. "We see the launch of our
Korean language website as the first in a number of exciting
initiatives that we will be undertaking, many of which will be
with Samsung.


"The new website will give our Korean supporters a fan friendly
service in their native language and tailored to their football
culture. We are replicating the approach we started in other key
countries such as China."


The connections between Chelsea and Samsung will be extended this
summer when the Bluewings, a Korean club also backed by the
company, take part in a four- team tournament in Los Angeles
involving Chelsea, David Beckham's new club LA Galaxy and Tigres.
