Gunmen on a motorbike hurled grenades and opened fire on an army
vehicle in a Pakistani tribal area Tuesday, killing five members
of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, officials said.


The attack happened in the rugged Bajaur region bordering
Afghanistan, where Pakistan authorities and tribesmen had just
Monday signed a peace deal with Taliban militants.


A major and an assistant director of the military-run ISI were
killed in the attack, along with two other ISI officials and
their driver, local intelligence official Moaz Khan told AFP.


"Masked men riding on a motorbike opened fire on the vehicle when
the ISI officials were coming to Bajaur tribal district from (the
northwestern city of) Peshawar," he said.


"They also lobbed two hand grenades at the vehicle and fled."


Security officials gave the men's ranks on condition of
anonymity. They did not say what the ISI officials were doing in
the area.


Bajaur, one of Pakistan's seven federally administered tribal
zones bordering Afghanistan, was the scene of an alleged CIA
missile strike which killed 18 people in January 2006.


Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda's Egyptian deputy leader, was said to
have escaped the attack.
