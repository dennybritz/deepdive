China saw a sharp increase last year in the amount of drugs
seized at its borders and the number of cross-border drug
trafficking cases it investigated, state media reported on
Tuesday.


Chinese police and customs agents seized 789 kilograms (1736
pounds) of various illicit drugs in 2006, up 65.5 percent year-
on-year, Xinhua news agency quoted a senior anti-smuggling
official as saying.


Customs police investigated 335 cases of drug trafficking, up
91.9 percent over the previous year, Xinhua quoted Li Wenjian,
deputy head of the anti-smuggling bureau under the General
Administration of Customs, as saying.


"The amount of drugs seized at customs points has been on the
rise in recent years, which shows that overseas drug dealers are
transporting more drugs to and through China," Li said.


The report did not specify which drugs were involved.


China established an anti-smuggling police force at its border
crossing and customs checks in 1999. The force now has more than
9,000 officers, Xinhua reported.
