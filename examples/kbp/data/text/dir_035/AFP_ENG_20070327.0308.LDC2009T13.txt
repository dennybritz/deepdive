Rahil Gangjee and Adam Groom led a record field by one stroke
halfway through final Asian qualifying for the British Open on
Tuesday.


The Indian and Australian, both aged 28, shot six-under 66s at
the par-72 Sentosa Golf Club, leaving them one good round from a
maiden Open appearance at Carnoustie in July.


Digvijay Singh, Lee Won-joon and Sushi Ishigaki, a stroke back on
67, were also in line for The Open after the number of spots up
for grabs was raised to five.


Australia's David Gleeson and Toshinori Muto were joint sixth
after carding four-under 68.


Gangjee was hoping to make it third time lucky after failing in
two previous attempts to qualify for the prestigious tournament.


"I'm pleased since this is my third time at the qualifiers. I was
a little tired after the Singapore Masters and I took around two
weeks off, so I'm feeling good," he said.


"My goal for tomorrow is to not think about anything but focus on
my pre-shot routine. If I strike it well off the tee, it will be
a putting match and that's the key here."


Groom was equally determined to make it through after chalking up
seven birdies against a lone bogey for his 66.


"I finally produced a steady round today. I was shooting birdies
and bogeys in previous tournaments this year but today, I was
consistent the entire  round," he said.


"I was putting really well and rolling the ball good and I hope
to keep it up tomorrow. I'm really excited as this has definitely
boosted my chances to make it to The Open."


Local favourite Mardan Mamat struck a 71 in tied 12th place while
India's Shiv Kapur was even-par for the day in joint 31st
position.
