Sri Lanka's star off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was named on
Tuesday as the Wisden almanack's "leading cricketer in the
world."


He is the fourth recipient of the title since it was inaugurated,
following Australians Ricky Ponting and Shane Warne and England
all-rounder Andrew Flintoff.


The award differs from the traditional five cricketers of the
year, as it can be won more than once by the same player.


"Muralitharan is a truly great criceter," said Wisden's Simon
Barnes. "Those that cannot go along with such a sentiment have
something lacking in their souls. The spirit of cricket,
perhaps."


The Sri Lankan enjoyed another prolific year with the ball and is
closing in on 700 Test wickets.


The arrival of England's left-arm spinner Monty Panesar in
international cricket is recognised as he is named as one of this
year's five, as is Paul Collingwood's development into a top-
class all-rounder.


Surrey's Mark Ramprakash also receives the accolade for his
phenomenal domestic season - in which he scored 2,278 runs -
while Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene and Pakistan run
machine Mohammad Yousuf are the other recipients.
