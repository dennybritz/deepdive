White House spokesman Tony Snow was been diagnosed with a
recurrence of cancer which has spread, deputy spokeswoman Dana
Perino said Tuesday.


Snow, 51, who survived a bout with colon cancer in 2005, had
surgery Monday to remove a growth in his abdomen.


"I've just spoken to him but unfortunately the growth was
cancerous, there has been some metastasis," Perino said.


"He spoke with the president this morning. He is in consultations
with his doctors on chemotherapy treatments," she said, adding
that Snow vowed to "beat it again."
