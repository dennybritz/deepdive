Police in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Italy launched
simultaneous dawn raids Tuesday in a corruption investigation
involving European public servants, the Brussels prosecutors
office said.


More than 150 police took part in more than 30 raids, including
at the European Commission's premises and the European Parliament
in Brussels, in which investigators seized numerous documents, it
said.


The Commission, the EU's executive body, said it was cooperating
fully with the inquiry.


"The Commission... is collaborating fully with the national
authorities carrying out this inquiry in the interest of shedding
full light on the allegations and suspicisions that exist," a
spokesman said.


"It's an ongoing investigation so it's not appropriate at this
time for the Commission to comment on this investigation," said
chief spokesman Johannes Laitenberger.


"Until the end of the inquiry and facts are established,
presumption of innocence must prevail," he said.


The EU's OLAF anti-fraud office was assisting in the
investigation, he added.
