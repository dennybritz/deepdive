Authorities in India's northeastern state of Assam offered
Tuesday to hold unconditional peace talks with a leading
separatist group behind a long-running insurgency.


The offer comes in the wake of similar overtures for talks by the
outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), which has been
fighting for an independent homeland since 1979.


"We are offering our hands of friendship to the ULFA for holding
unconditional talks with the government," Assam chief minister
Tarun Gogoi told reporters in Assam's main city of Guwahati.


"A political solution through negotiations is the only way for a
solution, instead of trying to find one with bullets," Gogoi
said, making the offer on behalf of the federal government.


The ULFA said in statements in the past two weeks that it was
ready to hold a dialogue with New Delhi if the government agreed
to discuss the issue of sovereignty.


But the chief minister said this was an area where no progress
could ever be made.


"Let me be frank: there is no point in discussing things that
cannot be conceded," the chief minister said.


The outfit is also seeking the release of five of its jailed
leaders as a precondition for direct talks between its top
leadership and New Delhi.


The federal government and ULFA representatives have held three
rounds of talks, but the dialogue broke down in September after
New Delhi called off a six-week ceasefire and resumed military
operations against the group.


The guerrilla group was also blamed for a string of attacks in
January that killed about 80 people.


More than 10,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in
Assam during the past two decades.
