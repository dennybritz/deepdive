Striker Dave Kitson has penned a new three-year deal which will
keep him at Premiership new boys Reading till 2010.


Kitson, whose previous deal was due to expire in the summer of
2008, joined Reading from Cambridge United for 350,000 pounds
(515,000 euros) in December 2003.


The 27-year-old Kitson has had knee problems this season which
have kept him out of the side though he had a dream start to his
Premiership campaign.


He scored Reading's first Premiership goal in the opening day 3-2
victory over Middlesbrough, but then picked up the knee problems
later in the match which ruled him out until January.


But he has recently scored in FA Cup games against Birmingham and
Manchester United.


The Royals' director of football Nick Hammond said: "This is an
extremely important signing for us because we have no doubt Dave
is fully capable of scoring goals at the highest level, which is
a very valuable commodity and one that is difficult to find.


"We are confident Dave will show those qualities over the
remainder of this campaign and going into next season."


Meanwhile, manager Steve Coppell's backroom staff are set to
follow him in signing new two-year contracts at the Madejski
Stadium within the next few weeks.


Coppell broke with his usual tradition of signing only one-year
deals when he penned a new agreement on Monday.


Coppell has signed up with his team in a rare slump having lost
three of their last four games and managing only a disappointing
goalless home draw with Portsmouth last time out.


But coaches Kevin Dillon, Wally Downes and Nigel Gibbs, whose
current deals are also up at the end of the season, look certain
to commit to new long-term agreements.
