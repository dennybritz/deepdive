Scientists have moved one step closer to understanding how stars
are formed after the discovery of molecular oxygen in
interstellar space, the Swedish Space Corporation said on
Tuesday.


The discovery "is important for understanding the chemistry in
large interstellar clouds where new stars are formed, and the
processes behind star formation," it said in a statement.


All previous attempts to detect molecular oxygen in interstellar
space, from both observatories on Earth and in space, had failed.


For the first time, a team of Swedish, Canadian, Finnish and
French scientists were successful, using the Odin space
observatory located in space. It is used to study both celestial
objects and Earth's atmosphere.


Molecular oxygen "was found in a dense (astronomically speaking)
gas cloud in the constellation of Ophiuchus, at a distance of
about 500 light years," the statement said.


The observations were made during 33 days over a period from
August 2002 to February 2006.


The research conclusions were published in the European
scientific weekly Astronomy & Astrophysics.
