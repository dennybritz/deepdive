Working hard at the office is not enough to warrant a promotion
in one Chinese county, where a new rule says government employees
must also be nice to their parents, state press reported Monday.


Changyuan county in central Henan province is sending assessment
teams to interview officials' relatives, neighbours and
colleagues to determine if they are caring towards their mother
and father, the China Daily said.


Up to 500 people may be interviewed before the government decides
if an employee shows adequate devotion to his or her parents.


"Officials should possess traditional values of filial piety and
family responsibility, which are the foundations of a successful
career," the paper quoted the county's Communist Party chief, Liu
Sen, as saying.


The measure was introduced as a way to restore the traditional
Chinese value of caring for parents, which has started to fade
away in fast-changing China.


"As the country modernises and family ties come under strain,
many are calling for the revival of traditional values such as
filial piety and respect for the elderly," the paper said.
