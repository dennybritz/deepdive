Operations on the main runway of New Delhi international airport
resumed Monday, several hours after an Air India jet made an
emergency landing and its nose wheel collapsed, officials said.


"At 1319 hours (0749 GMT) we started using the main runway,"
Indira Gandhi International Airport spokesman Arun Arora told
AFP, explaining that the landing tarmac with the collapsed
aircraft had been cordoned off.


The runway was blocked early Monday when an Air India aircraft --
an Airbus A310 which arrived in New Delhi from Shanghai via
Bangkok carrying 169 passengers -- developed landing gear
problems before touching down.


After the aircraft touched down on the runway under emergency
conditions, the front landing gear collapsed, said an official
with the Airports Authority of India, which provides air traffic
control services to the privately-managed airport.


All the passengers and 14 crew members were evacuated safely, a
Press Trust of India news agency report said.


The airport has an auxiliary runway but with the main runway
blocked numerous flights were delayed, because of longer taxiing
time, until airport officials managed to cordon off the craft and
shorten the runway to resume flights.


"We've changed the threshold length. We've reduced it by 1,000
metres (3,300 feet)," Arora said. The entire runway measured
3,810 metres, other airport officials said.


Heavy lifting equipment to remove the plane had been brought in
by Air India from Mumbai, airport authorities added, in order to
completely clear the collapsed aircraft.


"That will take another three to four hours," said Arora.
