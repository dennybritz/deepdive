Polling stations began to close Monday in troubled East Timor
after an election to replace the former guerrilla leader Xanana
Gusmao as president.


Alarico Moreirra, the head of one polling station in the capital,
Dili, said he closed as scheduled at 4:00 pm (0700 GMT) "because
there are no longer any voters coming."


"After this, a preliminary count will be started," he said.


Votes are initially counted openly at polling stations where
anybody can watch.


Long lines of voters had formed at some stations after balloting
began at 7:00 am under tight security. There were more than 700
polling stations in the former Portuguese colony, formally known
as Timor-Leste.


More than 522,000 people were registered to vote in the contest,
seen as a fight between three contenders, including Prime
Minister and Nobel peace laureate Jose Ramos-Horta.


He was up against the Fretilin party's chairman Francisco
Guterres, 53, a former guerrilla popularly known as Lu-Olo.


Fretilin, which led the country's independence struggle against
Indonesian occupation, holds a majority in parliament.


A third candidate, Fernando "Lasama" de Araujo, the chairman of
the opposition Democratic Party, also stands a chance of winning,
said Damien Kingsbury of Australia's Deakin University.


Lasama was imprisoned during Indonesia's 24-year occupation of
East Timor.


A total of eight candidates were seeking to replace Gusmao, who
did not seek re- election in the first ballot since independence
in 2002.


The United Nations said voting appeared to proceed smoothly and a
high turnout was likely.


Results should be available later this week but if no candidate
wins more than 50 percent, a runoff will be held on May 9.
