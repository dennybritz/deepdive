Rescuers have found the body of a man believed to be a member of
a crew of 20 that went missing after their cargo ship sank in
waters off of China's east coast, state press reported Monday.


Seventeen rescue boats and three helicopters have scoured the
region off Zhejiang province since the boat registered in Belize
sank after colliding with a Chinese vessel early Sunday morning,
Xinhua news agency said.


A spokesman with the Zhejiang Maritime Affairs Bureau refused to
provide details of the condition of the body, nor its identity,
the report said.


The accident occurred just before sunrise Sunday morning in the
Taizhou strait off the Zhejiang coast, when the 3,700-tonne cargo
ship, identified by its name "Harvest," sank after colliding with
the larger Chinese vessel.


Nineteen Chinese sailors and one Indian were aboard the ship when
it sank, the government reported earlier.


The ill-fated boat was travelling from China's eastern port of
Shanghai to Vietnam with 5,000 tonnes of steel, it reported.


Xinhua earlier said the ship was from Cambodia.
