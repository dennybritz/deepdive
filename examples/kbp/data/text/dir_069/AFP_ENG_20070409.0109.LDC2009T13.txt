Thailand's military-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont
will spend three days in hospital for an unscheduled medical
check-up, his doctor said Monday.


Surayud, 64, was admitted to a Bangkok hospital on Monday after
cancelling his appointments for the day.


His doctor insisted nothing serious was wrong with the prime
minister's health, but said he would spend three days in hospital
for a check-up and could return to work on April 12.


"He has got high blood pressure as well as higher fats and uric
acid than normal. There is nothing serious to worry about," said
doctor Panya Taweethaikarn.


"The premier was scheduled to have a check-up last year (but
didn't). The last time he did was seven years ago," he told
reporters.


"This is a good opportunity ahead of a long weekend for the
check-up. The entire process will take a couple of days, when he
will stay at the hospital. He can leave to get back to work as
normal on April 12," the doctor added.


Thailand begins its five-day celebration of the Buddhist New Year
on Friday, a period when the country shuts down for the most
important holiday on the Thai calendar.


Surayud, a former army chief, was installed after the military
ousted elected premier Thaksin Shinawatra in a September coup.
