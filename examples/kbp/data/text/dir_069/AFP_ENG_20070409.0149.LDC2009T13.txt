Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Monday he is
still waiting to meet German auto giant Volkswagen's top official
to discuss a possible tie-up with troubled carmaker Proton.


"I have not seen him yet. He has not made his appearance yet but
I cannot wait too long," Abdullah told reporters, referring to
Volkswagen's chairman.


The government is under pressure to find a strategic partner for
the loss-making national carmaker, having missed two self-imposed
deadlines.


"The information relayed to me was that he wanted to see me.
Well, I can't be waiting forever," Abdullah said.


Talks between the two companies have been ongoing and Abdullah
revealed a week ago that officials from the German automaker had
sought a meeting with him in Malaysia.


The last deadline missed for a possible alliance was March 31,
with Second Finance Minister Nor Mohamed Yakcop saying the
government was still reviewing options.


Abdullah has said Proton would turn to US auto giant General
Motors if talks with Volkswagen failed.


In March, negotiations with French car giant PSA Peugeot-Citroen
for an alliance collapsed after almost six months of
negotiations.


Three Malaysian automotive firms have also expressed interest in
partnering the national carmaker.


Proton posted a third consecutive quarterly loss of 281.45
million ringgit (80.40 million US dollars) in the three months to
December compared with a net profit of 86.51 million ringgit a
year earlier.
