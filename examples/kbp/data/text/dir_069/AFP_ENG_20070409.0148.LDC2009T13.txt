Olympic and world champion Michael Phelps said here Monday
Australia's Ian Thorpe, battling drug allegations, could bounce
back from retirement to compete in next year's Beijing Olympics.


The US sensation, fresh from his seven gold-medal haul at the
Melbourne World Swimming Championships, said he supported
Thorpe's battle to clear his name over doping allegations.


"Ian and I have been great friends and great competitors over the
past few years and I definitely wish him all the best," Phelps
said.


"Definitely my support is with him and I am definitely hoping for
the best."


French newspaper L'Equipe reported last month that Thorpe had
returned high levels of testosterone and another naturally
occurring hormone in a doping control in May last year.


Following his retirement in November, Thorpe, who won five
Olympic and 10 world titles during his career, has denied any
wrongdoing.


Phelps said a swimmer normally needed four years to prepare
himself for the physical and mental challenge of the Olympics but
Thorpe was an exception.


"I would not be surprised if Thorpe came back," said Phelps, who
claimed Thorpe's 200m freestyle world record at the Melbourne
World Championships.


"He is a remarkable athlete and with the amount of talent he has
for the sport of swimming he can do anything he wants.


"If he wants to start training now and get ready for the Olympics
next year I would not put it past him."
