More than a dozen Muslim detainees have launched a new hunger
strike at the US detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, The
New York Times reported on its website Sunday.


Citing military officials and lawyers, the newspaper said the
military responded by beginning to force-feed the detainees.


Lawyers for several hunger strikers said the hunger strike had
been prompted by harsh conditions at a new maximum security
complex, to which about 160 prisoners had been moved since
December, according to the report.


The 13 detainees now on hunger strikes is the highest number to
endure the force-feeding regimen on an extended basis since early
2006, when the military broke a long-running strike with a new
policy of strapping prisoners into restraint chairs while they
are fed by plastic tubes inserted through their nostrils, the
paper said.


The hunger strikers are now monitored so closely the they have
virtually no chance to starve themselves, according to The Times.


"We don't have any rights here, even after your Supreme Court
said we had rights," the report quotes one hunger striker, Majid
al-Joudi, as telling a military physician, according to medical
records released recently under a federal court order.


"If the policy does not change, you will see a big increase in
fasting," al- Joudi said.


Newly released Pentagon documents show that during earlier hunger
strikes, before the use of restraint chairs, some detainees
suffered sharp weight losses, The Times said.


A handful of those prisoners lost more than 30 pounds (13.5
kilograms) in a matter of weeks, according to the report.
