A Bangladeshi airforce fighter pilot died Monday after his plane
crashed into a bamboo forest in the western district of Jessore,

The pilot lost control of the fighter jet used for training about
270 kilometres (169) miles west of the capital, Dhaka, local
police police chief M.A. Aziz said, adding that fire crews were
on the scene.


Fire engulfed the forest and some adjoining areas, but nearby
