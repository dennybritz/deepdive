Thai police on Monday started distributing "super sour" sweets
blessed by a Buddhist abbot in the hope of curbing road accidents
by keeping motorists awake with the lip-puckering treats.


Police began distributing 140,000 of the hard sweets ahead of the
Buddhist New Year celebrations that run over five days starting
Friday.


It's the most important holiday and biggest party time in
Thailand, but also a time of carnage on the highways due to the
heavy incidence of drunk driving.


An abbot in the southern province of Prachaup Khiri Khan donated
200,000 baht (5,700 dollars) to make 140,000 packets of sweets to
give to drivers nationwide.


On Saturday, 2,999 monks gathered at a temple to bless the
confectionery, known as "super sours," police said.


"Given the high rate of traffic accidents during the New Year
holidays, I tried to figure out how to possibly help to minimise
the number" of crashes, regional highway police chief Colonel
Panya Pinsuk told AFP.


"The major cause of the accidents is that people get very tired
from driving after days of celebration," he said.


"The taste is very sour, which can keep you awake. The candy was
also blessed by the monks, which makes people more comfortable
and confident when driving," said Panya.


The government hopes to cut the number of road deaths by 15
percent from the nearly 500 who were killed last year.
