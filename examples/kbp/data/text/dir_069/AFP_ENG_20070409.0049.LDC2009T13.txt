Beijing Olympic organisers on Monday offered free tours of the
Chinese capital in August to 10 families who attract the most
votes in a worldwide Olympic Internet competition.


Families, five from China and five from overseas, must have at
least three members and register for the competition from Monday
on the organising committee website, organisers said at the
launch ceremony.


The first round sees families join a virtual tour of Olympic
venues during which they must play games and answer quiz
questions online.


The 100 families who survive the virtual tour pass through to the
next round in which they are required to set up their own blog,
come up with a family Olympic slogan and post pictures and
stories.


The final 10 families are those who can attract the most votes
from visitors to the website.


The tours begin on August 8, the one-year countdown to the 2008
games and include tickets to Olympic test events in Beijing and
other cities as well as tours to the Great Wall and Beijing's
famous Forbidden City.


"The competition will encourage more public involvement in the
Olympics," said organising committee vice president Jiang Xiaoyu.


"This event will create interaction between Chinese and foreign
families and shorten the distance between China and the rest of
the world."


The website for families to register is www.beijing2008.cn.
