Raja Bell sunk six three-pointers and scored 22 points while
guarding Kobe Bryant and helping Phoenix defeat the Los Angeles
Lakers 115-107 on Sunday to complete a successful road trip.


Canadian Steve Nash had 25 points and 11 assists and Leandro
Barbosa scored 23 points off the bench for the Suns who improved
to 58-19 and moved 2 1/2 games in front of San Antonio in the
race for the second seed in the Western Conference.


That slot could create a matchup with the Lakers (40-37), who
fell one-half game behind Denver into seventh place.


If so, it would foster the feud between Bell and Bryant, who have
been going at each other for six years.


The duo first tangled in the 2001 NBA finals, when Bell was a
rookie reserve on the Philadelphia 76ers who refused to back down
to one of the league's biggest stars. It became more heated over
the last two seasons since Bell joined the Suns.


During the 2006 postseason, Bell was suspended one game for
taking a shot at Bryant, who smirked, "I don't even know this
kid."


The two were matched up again and spent a portion of the game
jawing at each other. Bryant, who is closing in on his second
straight scoring title, had 34 points and seven assists. But he
got to know Bell a little better.


Bell did not miss from the arc, draining a pair of three-pointers
in the final period, when the Suns erupted for 41 points.


It was a remarkable turnaround for Bell, who tied an NBA record
by going zero- of-10 from the arc in Friday's win at New Orleans.
Sunday he was six-of-six.
