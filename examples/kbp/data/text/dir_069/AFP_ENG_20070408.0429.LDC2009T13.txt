Polling opened Monday morning in an election to replace the
former guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao as president of troubled
East Timor.


"The vote is now open," said Carlos Barbosa, head of a polling
station in Meti Aut, a district of the capital, Dili.


Polls opened at 7:00 am (2200 GMT Sunday) and were to close at
4:00 pm.


Voting was taking place under tight security and amid concern
over whether the result will be credible in a contest seen as a
three-way fight.


At Meti Au there was no tension as about 30 people lined up to
cast their ballots under a bright early-morning sky at the simple
polling station with a desk and yellow plastic tape that marked
the area for people to wait.


"I am happy to vote for our future. It's an important moment,"
said Francisca Freitas, 38.


About a dozen United Nations police officers from New Zealand,
Nepal and Portugal stood by.


"I am very happy to give support to our nation which is already
broken," said another voter, Armindo Moreira.
