Vietnam's state owned EVN Telecom has joined a 200-million-dollar
project by Singapore based VSNL International to lay a pan-Asian
submarine optic cable, state-controlled media said Monday.


The 6,800 kilometre (4,200 mile) cable network will link
Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, Japan, Guam, Taiwan
and Hong Kong, the Tin Tuc or News daily reported.


Vietnam's landing station would be in the southern city of Vung
Tau, near the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City, and the cable
is expected to be operational in the first quarter of next year,
the report said.

and operates international mobile, voice and data networks.


EVN Telecom, a subsidiary of Electricity of Vietnam, provides
CDMA mobile phone, landline phone and internet services.
