East Timor's election commission said Monday an "emergency
situation" had developed at polling stations across the country
because of a shortage of ballot papers.


"This is an emergency situation in all districts, because the
queues were still long but the ballots were exhausted," said
Martinho Gusmao, a spokesman for the National Election
Commission, which organised the ballot.
