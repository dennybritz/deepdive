East Timor's Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta was among the first
to vote Monday in the presidential election in which he is a
candidate.


Ramos-Horta, one of three candidates seen as contenders to win,
voted shortly after polling opened at a primary school in Meti
Aut, a district of the capital Dili.


About 30 other voters who were waiting to cast ballots welcomed
him by calling "Horta" and wishing him "Good day". A few people
applauded.


Asked by reporters whether he thinks he can win, Ramos-Horta
said: "The people will win. Whatever the result is, I believe
democracy wins if everybody respects the results."


Some candidates have said they fear attempts have been made to
manipulate the election process but Ramos-Horta said he thought
the process has been free and fair.


"So far, I think so. Despite some flaws, some intimidation, some
incidents that have occurred. By and large, I think we can say
yes."


At least 32 people were injured in election-related clashes
Wednesday in and around the capital Dili although most of the
campaign was peaceful, according to the United Nations.


Ramos-Horta said the common people have always behaved well.


"The question is the leaders," he said. "My appeal to the leaders
is to show their sense of responsibility, of statesmanship and
abide by the result whatever it is."


Ramos-Horta is one of eight candidates vying to replace President
Xanana Gusmao, the charismatic former guerrilla leader of the
nation which Indonesia occupied for 24 years.


This is the first presidential election since East Timor's 2002
independence.
