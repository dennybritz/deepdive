A controversial Philippine senatorial candidate who helped topple
former president Joseph Estrada was injured in a helicopter crash
while campaigning Monday, an official said.


Luis 'Chavit' Singson, an ally of President Gloria Arroyo,
escaped with only minor injuries when the helicopter he was
travelling in slammed into a hillside in heavy fog in Mountain
Province, some 280 kilometers (174 miles) north of Manila.


He was travelling with two aides and the pilot, but their
condition was not known, said Ben Evardone, a spokesman for
Arroyo's political party.


"He sustained injuries," Evardone said, adding that Singson was
en route to a nearby hospital. "The chopper took off amid heavy
fog."


Singson is the governor of the tobacco-growing Ilocos Sur region
in the north.


Allegations he made of corruption involving tobacco excise taxes
led to the impeachment of former president Joseph Estrada, his
estranged gambling buddy. All in all, Estrada is accused of
plundering government coffers of up to 80 million dollars during
his 30 months in office.


Estrada is now under house arrest while awaiting a verdict in his
five-year corruption trial that ended last year.


The Philippines is to select 12 senators, some 250 members of the
House of Representatives, and more than 17,000 local officials
from mayors to governors on May 14.
