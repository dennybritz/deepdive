The search for two missing French tourists entered its fourth day
on Monday after the sinking of a Greek cruise ship off the Greek
island of Santorini.


Three patrol boats, a helicopter and divers took part in the
search while a special submarine will be sent from Athens to
Santorini by Tuesday, according to the merchant marine ministry.


Almost 1,600 passengers and crew were evacuated before the Sea
Diamond sank early Friday, with the exception of Jean-Christophe
Allain, 45, and his 16-year- old daughter Maud.


Their cabin was near to the collision point, but Greek navy
divers have so far failed to locate the pair.


On Monday, two anti-pollution boats continued the clean-up
operation of an oil slick that had appeared while measures were
taken to contain any further pollution in the area where the ship
went down, the minister said.


The attempts to empty its tanks, which contain close to 410
tonnes of fuel, have been hampered by the fact that the wreckage
has sunk 100 metres (320 feet) below the surface.


The Sea Diamond's captain and five officers on Saturday were
charged with causing a shipwreck through negligence, breaching
international shipping safety regulations and polluting the
environment.


According to the ship's captain, the Sea Diamond, built in 1986
and described by its Cypriot operator Louis Hellenic Cruise Lines
as "ultra modern", had not suffered a mechanical failure but had
been pushed against the reef by sea currents.
