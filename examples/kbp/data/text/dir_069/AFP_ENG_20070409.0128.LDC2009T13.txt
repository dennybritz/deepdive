Prosecutors on Monday appealed the decision to throw out an
indecency case against the editor of Playboy Indonesia following
a trial that pitted press freedom against Islamic mores.


Prosecutor Agung Ardianto told reporters the move was due to a
"difference in perception" with the judges, who dismissed the
case against 42-year-old Erwin Arnada on Thursday on a
technicality.


Ardianto did not elaborate further after registering the appeal
in the capital, Jakarta.


The judges in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation
ruled that the case had been wrongly brought under the penal code
rather than laws governing the press.


Prosecutors had sought a two-year jail term. Muslim hardliners
protested outside the court as the judges read out their verdict
last week and later demanded an appeal.


"Prosecutors, move forward and exterminate Playboy," the
hardliners wrote on a poster. Another read: "Hang Erwin."


Playboy's debut issue in April last year featured several models
on its cover and inside pages showing ample cleavage and long
legs -- but nothing more explicit.


Racier men's magazines, newspapers and websites are available in
the country.


Playboy moved its Indonesian headquarters to the predominantly
Hindu resort island of Bali after earlier protests by Muslim
hardliners and attacks on its offices in the capital, Jakarta.
