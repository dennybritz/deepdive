A white mouse grounded a Vietnam Airlines flight to Japan for
more than three hours with dozens of staff scrambling to find the
rodent in the cabin, the state-run carrier said Monday.


The animal was eventually found in a food compartment of the
Boeing 777, allowing the delayed flight to take off from Hanoi to
Tokyo late Sunday, said Tran Tien Dung, head of the airline's
safety department.


"We delayed the flight for more than three hours and mobilised
dozens of staff to find the mouse, which we suspect came on board
in the pocket of a Vietnamese passenger," he told AFP.


"We were afraid it might chew through some of the plane's
cables."


Dung added that the airline did not plan to take any action even
if the owner of the mouse was identified. The fate of the rodent
was uncertain, with Dung saying only that "we took it away."
