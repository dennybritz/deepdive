Citibank N.A. of the US has agreed to acquire Taiwan's Bank of
Overseas Chinese (BOOC) for 14.1 billion Taiwan dollars (426
million US dollars), BOOC said Monday.


Citibank will acquire all 1.194 billion outstanding shares in
BOOC at 11.8 dollars per share through its subsidiary Citibank
Overseas Investment Corp, the Taiwanese bank said in a statement
filed to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.


The merger, pending regulatory approval, is expected to be
completed in the second half of this year, the statement said.


"The investment is expected to benefit Citibank's long term
development in Taiwan," it said.


The privately-run BOOC, founded in 1961, operates 55 branches in
Taiwan with 2,200 employees serving more than one million
customers.


After the acquisition, Citibank is expected to rank the 13th
largest bank and largest foreign bank in Taiwan, by raising the
number of branches to at least 66 branches on the island.


In November 2006, Standard Chartered, the Britain-based emerging
markets bank, completed a tender offer to take over Hsinchu
International Bank for 1.2 billion US dollars.
