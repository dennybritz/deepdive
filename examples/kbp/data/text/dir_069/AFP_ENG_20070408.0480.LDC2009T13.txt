The US point man on North Korea was due here Monday on the start
of a new tour of Asia as the clock ticks for Pyongyang to meet a
deadline in a breakthrough aid-for-disarmament deal.


US envoy Christopher Hill was set to arrive in Japan later Monday
for an overnight stay before heading on to South Korea and China,
a US embassy official said.


North Korea pledged in a six-nation deal in February to shut down
a key nuclear facility and allow the return of UN nuclear
inspectors by April 14 in return for badly needed fuel aid.


But both China, which is North Korea's main ally, and Japan have
doubted whether Pyongyang can meet the deadline amid a row over
how to return 25 million dollars in North Korean money that had
been frozen in a Macau bank.


North Korea, which tested an atom bomb last year, stormed out of
the latest round of six-way talks in March, saying it will not
negotiate until it sees the cash.


US President George W. Bush's administration, which has promoted
the North Korea deal as a foreign policy success at a time of
turmoil in Iraq, said last week that it had found a mechanism to
unblock the funds.


Hill starts his tour one day after a bipartisan US team headed by
former UN ambassador Bill Richardson arrived in Pyongyang. The
mission is officially in North Korea to recover the remains of US
soldiers killed in the Korean War.


The six-way talks group China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and
the United States.
