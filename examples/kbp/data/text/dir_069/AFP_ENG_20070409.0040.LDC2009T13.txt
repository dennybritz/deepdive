Japanese share prices closed up 1.48 percent Monday after strong
US jobs data calmed jitters over the US economy and pushed down
the yen in a boost for exporters, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 258.98 points to finish at 17,743.76. The broader TOPIX
index of all first-section issues rose 21.02 points or 1.22
percent to close at 1,738.10.
