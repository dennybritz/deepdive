The US military announced the deaths of six more US soldiers in a
series of attacks taking its toll for the month alone to 27, the
military said Monday.


The six were killed Sunday.


Three soldiers were killed and one wounded in a roadside bombing
during a patrol south of Baghdad.


One soldier was killed and three wounded by indirect fire in an
attack targeting their units, also south of Baghdad.


Two soldiers died north of Baghdad, one in the restive Diyala
province and another in the Salaheddin province. Both died of
wounds sustained in combat operations.


The latest fatalities brought the US military's losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion to 3,275, according to an AFP count
based on Pentagon figures.
