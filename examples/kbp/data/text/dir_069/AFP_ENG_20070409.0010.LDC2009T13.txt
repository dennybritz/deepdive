Hollywood movie star Nicole Kidman has denied reports that she is
pregnant after arriving home in Australia with country crooner
husband Keith Urban to start work on a new film.


The claim that she was expecting Urban's child, published in
Britain's News of the World tabloid, was dismissed as "100
percent not true" by Kidman's publicist, Australian media
reported Monday.


"She's looking forward to going outback and riding a horse and
being here for seven months making a film," said Wendy Day. "As
if she would confirm a pregnancy to News of the World."


Kidman will start working with Australian director Baz Luhrmann
this week on location in the country's remote and sparsely
populated "outback" on a romantic adventure epic entitled
"Australia", which co-stars Hugh Jackman.


"It's really good, really good," Kidman told reporters when asked
how it felt to be back home, adding that she was "excited" to be
making the film.


The 39-year-old Oscar-winning star of "The Hours" and Luhrmann's
"Moulin Rouge" has two children, Isabella and Connor, who she
adopted with her former husband, actor Tom Cruise.


Urban, who married Kidman in an elaborate ceremony in Sydney last
year, is due to start a concert tour of Australia next month.
