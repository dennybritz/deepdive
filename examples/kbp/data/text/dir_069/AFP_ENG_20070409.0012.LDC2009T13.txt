The president of Japanese camera maker Pentax Corp. will resign
to take responsibility for an internal conflict over a planned
merger with optical glass maker Hoya Corp., news reports said
Monday.


Pentax president Fumio Urano, 63, will step down by the end of
May and board member Takashi Watanuki, 54, is expected to replace
him under a reshuffle to be approved on Tuesday, Kyodo News
reported, quoting unnamed sources.


A company spokesman confirmed that a board meeting will take
place on Tuesday, adding: "A top management reshuffle may be on
the agenda at the meeting."


The reported rift among board members comes after Hoya said
Friday it was considering launching a tender offer for Pentax
instead of a merger through a share swap.


The two companies agreed last December to merge their operations
through a share swap that would take effect from October 2007,
but Hoya said in a statement that it may offer to buy Pentax
shares instead.


Hoya has reportedly proposed a new merger plan under which it
will raise its proposed offer for Pentax by about 20 percent to
770 yen per share to secure the support of shareholders.


The two companies, which are both manufacturers of medical
equipment, had said in December they planned to sign a contract
in April and integrate into Hoya Pentax HD Corp as of October 1.


Urano took the initiative to push for the merger with Hoya, but
some directors at Pentax are reportedly unhappy with the merger
plan.
