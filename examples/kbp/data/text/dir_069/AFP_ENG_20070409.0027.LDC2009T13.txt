Flights from New Delhi's international airport were delayed
Monday by an Air India jet blocking the main runway following an
emergency landing, the state carrier said.


The aircraft, which arrived in New Delhi from Shanghai via
Bangkok carrying 169 passengers, developed landing gear problems
before touching down at Indira Gandhi International Airport,
where passengers were evacuated safely.


"We are trying to see that the aircraft is taken off the runway,"
said Air India spokesman Venkat, who only uses one name.


"The tip of the aircraft is still on the runway. Our engineering
department is working on it and soon it will be cleared," he told
NDTV news channel.


The landing gear of the Airbus A310 totally collapsed, said an
official with the Airports Authority of India, which provides air
traffic control services to the privately-managed airport.


"Once the equipment which holds the weight of the aircraft
collapses it is a very serious thing," said Robin Pathak.


The airport has an auxiliary runway but with the main runway
blocked for several hours, numerous flights were delayed.
