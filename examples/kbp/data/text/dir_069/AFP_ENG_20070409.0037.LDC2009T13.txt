Passenger car sales in China rose by 16.1 percent in March from
the same month a year ago to 567,000 units, state media said
Monday.


In the first three months, sales rose 22.4 percent to 1.5 million
units, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers.


Sales of sedan cars jumped 30.1 percent to 1.1 million units in
the period while multi-purpose vehicles were up 14.9 percent to
53,300 units and sports utility vehicles up 15.8 percent to
71,600, the report said.


Analysts said car sales in China will continue to enjoy robust
growth in the coming years, boosted by the country's rapidly
growing economy and rising household incomes.


Jiang Lei, deputy chief of the association, cited earlier
forecasts that car sales in China will grow 15 percent to hit 8
million units this year, according to Xinhua.


China overtook Japan in 2006 to become the world's second largest
market for new vehicles after the United States with new vehicles
sales soaring 25.1 percent to 7.2 million units, Xinhua said.
