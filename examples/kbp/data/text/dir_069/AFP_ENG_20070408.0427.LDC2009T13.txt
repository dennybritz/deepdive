Marcus Trescothick gave struggling England a reminder of the
talents they are currently missing at the World Cup when he
hammered 256 off 117 balls for Somerset in a pre-season friendly
on Sunday.


The England opener, who pulled out of the Ashes tour to Australia
because of a stress-related illness, hit 19 sixes and 25 fours at
Taunton to help his side pile up 502-4 off 50 overs against the
amateurs of Devon.


The 31-year-old Trescothick underwent double hernia surgery
following his return to England but is now back to full fitness.
