Vietnamese veterans paid homage at South Korea's national
cemetery Monday and demanded US compensation for their exposure
to toxic defoliants, officials said.


A 10-member delegation from Vietnam's Association of Victims of
Agent Orange burned incense and prayed for Korean war veterans
buried at the cemetery, the Korean Disabled Veteran's Association
for Agent Orange said.


"The ceremony was watched by about 120 members from our
association," spokesman Kang Chang-Up told AFP.


The Vietnamese arrived here Monday for a week-long trip to
exchange information on lawsuits demanding compensation for the
defoliant used by the US military during the conflict.


"We are preparing for a lawsuit against the makers of Agent
Orange. So we want to learn from the South Korean group's
experience," Vietnamese delegation leader Do Xuan Dien, a former
army major-general, told Yonhap news agency.


"The past is bygone. South Korea and Vietnam are friends and
partners for now and the future," he added.


Last year, a South Korean court ordered US Agent Orange makers to
compensate thousands of veterans and their families.


South Korea sent some 300,000 troops to fight alongside the
United States and southern Vietnamese forces during the war.


Veterans here estimate the number of Korean victims of the
chemicals at about 150,000.


US forces widely sprayed Agent Orange, which contained the lethal
chemical dioxin, in Vietnam during the conflict to deprive enemy
guerrillas of forest cover and destroy food crops.


Vietnam says millions of people have suffered a range of
illnesses and birth defects as a result.
