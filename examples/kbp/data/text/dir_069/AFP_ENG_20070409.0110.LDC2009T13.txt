East Timor's election commission said Monday an "emergency
situation" had developed at polling stations across the country
because of a shortage of ballot papers.


"This is an emergency situation in all districts, because the
queues were still long but the ballots were exhausted," said
Martinho Gusmao, a spokesman for the National Election
Commission, which organised the ballot.


An East Timorese body helping to administer the vote said in a
statement that it was "addressing the need for additional ballot
papers at some locations" along with the United Nations mission
in East Timor.


Two UN helicopters and one from the international peacekeeping
force in East Timor made four "rapid reaction support flights to
meet ballot paper deficits," it said.


"On the back of what so far has been an operationally-successful
and peaceful polling day, a high morning and early-afternoon
turnout has been reported for Timor-Leste's presidential
election," it said.


The body, the Timorese Technical Secretariat for Election
Administration (STAE), issued its early-afternoon statement
before some polling stations began closing as scheduled at 0700
GMT.


It was unclear if voting had been formally extended elsewhere.
