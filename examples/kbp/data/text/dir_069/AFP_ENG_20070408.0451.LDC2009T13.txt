Team Australia's Will Power became the first Australian to win a
Champ Car World Series race Sunday with a triumph in the Vegas
Grand Prix.


Power started from pole and dominated throughout to take the flag
ahead of Dutch rookie Robert Doornbos and Canadian Champ Car
veteran Paul Tracy.


Three-time defending champion Sebastien Bourdais of France capped
a frustrating opening weekend by failing to finish, along with
his young Newman-Haas teammate Graham Rahal.


Bourdais, who started from the last row of the grid after
brushing the wall in final qualifying on Saturday, crashed after
30 laps of the 68-lap race on the temporary circuit through the
streets of Las Vegas.


Bourdais had made a superb move through the field up to fifth
place when a puncture forced him into the pits, then his brush
with the wall ended his day for good.


Bourdais's rookie teammate Graham Rahal, 18, made an even earlier
exit after a first-lap crash.


Power, seeking to build on his rookie of the year season in 2006,
was 16.787sec ahead of Doornbos.


Other former Australian podium winners in the US open-wheel
circuit have included Geoff Brabham and former Formula One world
champion Alan Jones, but Power became the first Australian to
stand on the top step.


Power's teammate, Simon Pagenaud of France, withdrew after 47
laps with engine problems.


Canada's Alex Tagliani and France's Tristan Gommendy rounded out
the top five.


The series shifts to Long Beach, California, for the second race
of the season next weekend.
