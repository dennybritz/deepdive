The New York Yankees placed slugger Hideki Matsui on the 15-day
disabled list on Sunday with a strained left hamstring.


The 32-year-old left fielder from Japan missed four months last
season after breaking his left wrist on May 11.


Matsui had played in 518 consecutive games with the Yankees
before suffering the wrist injury.


He lasted just four games this season before once again landing
on the DL.  He suffered the hamstring strain while running out a
ground ball in the second inning of Saturday's game against the
Baltimore Orioles.


Matsui is batting .250 (3-for-12) with three RBI this season.
