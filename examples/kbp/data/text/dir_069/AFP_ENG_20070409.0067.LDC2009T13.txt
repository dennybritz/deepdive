EVA Airways Corp Monday posted a 1.69 billion Taiwan dollars
(51.05 million US) net loss for 2006 due to sharp hikes in fuel
prices, compared with a 1.33 billion dollar net profit a year
earlier.


"Fuel expense accounts for more than 40 percent of EVA Air's
total costs. High international crude oil prices last year did
matter a lot to the company," an EVA Air spokeswoman said.


EVA Air's load factor for passenger flights in 2006 rose to 79.95
percent from 78.71 percent a year earlier, while its load factor
for cargo flights in  2006 increased to 73.30 percent from 72.88
percent, the spokeswoman said.


With a fleet of 50 aircraft, EVA Air currently serves 43
passenger and cargo destinations in 25 countries.
