Polling opened Monday morning in an election to replace the
former guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao as president of troubled
East Timor.


"The vote is now open," said Carlos Barbosa, head of a polling
station, in Meti Aut, a district of the capital, Dili.


Polls opened at 7:00 am (2200 GMT Sunday) and were to close at
4:00 pm.
