Japanese high-tech giant Toshiba Corp. said Monday that it had
filed a lawsuit in the United States against 17 companies for
alleged infringement of its DVD patents.


Toshiba filed the suit in the US District Court for the Northern
District of California on Friday, seeking undisclosed damages and
an injunction to prohibit the firms producing or selling the DVD
products in the United States.


The firms are mostly from China or Hong Kong.


The Japanese company said in a statement that it had also filed a
complaint on Friday with the US International Trade Commission,
calling for a halt to the importation of DVD players by the 17
companies.


The 17 companies do not have license agreements with Toshiba and
have imported and sold DVD products without permission, it said.


"Toshiba seeks to exclude infringing imports, recover monetary
damages, and secure agreements to respect Toshiba's intellectual
property rights in the future," the Japanese group said in a
statement.


The 17 companies include Daewoo Electronics America Inc.,
Dongguan GVG Digital Technology Ltd. and GVG Digital Technology
Holdings Ltd.
