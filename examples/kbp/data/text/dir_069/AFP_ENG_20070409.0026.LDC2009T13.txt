The Houston Rockets are fighting for home-court advantage in the
first round of the playoffs. Tracy McGrady is leading the way.


McGrady scored 40 points as the Rockets snapped a three-game
losing streak with a 112-106 victory over the Sacramento Kings on
Sunday.


Shooting 14-of-28 from the floor, including 3-of-6 from the
3-point arc, McGrady also dished out 10 assists and grabbed eight
rebounds and Luther Head added 18 points off the bench for
Houston, which climbed within a half-game of Utah (48-28) for the
fourth seed and home-court advantage in the first round of the
Western Conference playoffs.


The Kings tied the score, 89-89, on Francisco Garcia's 3-pointer
with 8:00 remaining, but the Rockets responded by hitting three
straight 3-pointers to spark an 11-2 run over the next 3:19 that
broke open the game.


Head hit two 3-pointers during the spurt and finished the game
4-of-4 from the arc.


All-Star centre Yao Ming scored 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting and
blocked four shots in just 25 minutes for Houston, which hit
12-of-12 from the free-throw line over the final 3:48 to seal the
win.
