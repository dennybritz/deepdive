The Azerbaijani capital Baku, flush with oil revenues, will bid
to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, President Ilham Aliyev said
Monday.


"We have put forward a bid to host the Olympic Games in 2016,"
Aliyev said during the opening of a sports complex in the town of
Masalli, 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of Baku, attended by
European Olympic Committee President Patrick Hickey.


"We are the first country of the former Soviet Union, other than
Russia, that has made such a request to the International Olympic
Committee," Aliyev said.


Russia is bidding to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in the
southern city of Sochi.


Azerbaijan's economy is among the fastest growing in the world
thanks to its significant energy reserves and position as a
transportation hub for Caspian Sea oil.


But despite a major building boom in Baku, much of the capital's
infrastructure is crumbling, and raging inflation has prevented
many ordinary people from sharing in the energy boom.


Azerbaijan took one gold medal in wrestling and four bronze in
boxing and shooting at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.


Bid cities have until September 15 to submit a letter of interest
to the IOC, which will announce the host city in 2009.


Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and the Czech capital Prague have
already announced plans to bid for the 2016 games.


Other cities expected in the race include Madrid, Rome, and Doha,
Qatar. The US Olympic Committee is deciding between Los Angeles
and Chicago as its 2016 candidate.
