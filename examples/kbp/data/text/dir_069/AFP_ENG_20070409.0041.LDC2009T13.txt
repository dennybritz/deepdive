Over 300 crane operators at a foreign-funded company in south
China have ended a rare one-day strike, triggered when a demand
for higher pay was turned down, state media said Monday.


A crane driver at the Shenzhen Yantian International Container
Terminals, a container terminal operator, asked for a pay rise on
behalf of his peers Friday but his request was not immediately
answered, the Xinhua news agency said.


Early Saturday, the incident escalated, as a strike involving
more than 300 crane operators broke out, the report said.


After mediation by local labour and transport authorities the
company agreed to give the workers an unspecified pay rise, and
the port resumed operations early Sunday morning, the report
said.


Shenzhen Yantian International Container Terminals was a joint
venture between the Hong Kong's Hutchison Port Holdings and
state-owned Shenzhen Yantian Port Group.


Strikes are very rare in China, as all labor unions are strictly
controlled by the government.


The drivers said that even though their company was prospering,
their salaries had not grown and some had seen their monthly pay
rise just 100 yuan (13 dollars) from a decade ago, according to
Xinhua.


The drivers asked for a monthly increase of 1,000 yuan and a
housing subsidy of 200 to 400 yuan, the report said, citing a
statement from the municipal government of Shenzhen, a booming
city in south China's Guangdong province.


They also demanded the company distribute bonuses in a fair
manner and set up a labour union, the report said.
