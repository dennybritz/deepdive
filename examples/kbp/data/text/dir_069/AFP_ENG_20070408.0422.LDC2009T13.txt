The female British sailor captured and held by Iran told the Sun
newspaper in an interview to appear Monday that her captors
stripped her, lied to her and suggested she might never see her
baby again.


Hours after the defence ministry relaxed its ban on service
personnel striking financial deals with media organisations,
mother-of-one Faye Turney, 26, told the tabloid her interrogators
taunted her with threats to her life.


"At one stage ... (the interrogator) asked me, 'How do you feel
about dying for your country?" she told the paper.


"The next day, another interrogator said to me, 'You don't
understand, you must cooperate with us. Do you not want to see
your daughter again?"


For the first five days of the 13-day detention, Turney was also
made to believe that the other 14 detainees -- all men -- had
gone home, and she was the only one left.


"I was thrown into a tiny little cell and ordered to strip off,"
Turney told the newspaper.


"They took everything from me apart from my knickers. Then some
cotton pyjamas were thrown in for me to wear and four filthy
blankets. The metal door slammed shut again."


Newspaper reports on Sunday suggested the 15 captured sailors and
marines could make up to 250,000 pounds (371,000 euros, 496,000
dollars) between them, with Turney standing to net 150,000
pounds.
