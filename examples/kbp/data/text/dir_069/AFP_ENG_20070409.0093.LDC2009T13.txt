The editor in chief of Italian daily La Repubblica on Monday said
the murder of the interpreter for an Italian journalist, who had
himself been kidnapped in Afghanistan, was "barbaric".


Ajmal Naqshbandi worked for La Repubblica journalist Daniele
Mastrogiacomo, before both were captured on March 4.


Ezio Mauro, the editor in chief of the newspaper that employs
Mastrogiacomo, said that the young Afghan interpreter, whose
execution was announced on Sunday, also worked as a journalist.


"We had hoped until the final moment that the news was not true.
This was a barbaric, unjust killing, even in a time of war," he
wrote.


"We at La Repubblica are mourning the death of a work colleague,
but at the same time denounce the difficulty for journalists to
carry out their work in the areas controlled by the Taliban who
despise not only the freedom of expression and the rights of
prisoners but also human life," concluded Mauro.


Mastrogiacomo was freed two weeks after their abduction in a
controversial exchange for five Taliban prisoners. Their Afghan
driver was beheaded before Mastrogiacomo's release.


As Italian newspapers are not published on Easter Monday, La
Repubblica's editorial was published on its website.
