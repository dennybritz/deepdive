The US military announced the deaths of five more US soldiers in
a series of attacks taking its toll for the month alone to 26,
the military said Monday.


The five were killed Sunday.


Three soldiers were killed and one wounded in a roadside bombing
during a patrol south of Baghdad.


One soldier was killed and three wounded in indirect fire attack
targeting their units also south of Baghdad.


Another soldier died of wounds sustained during combat operations
