US entertainment giant Walt Disney still hopes to open a theme
park in mainland China, but it will not necessarily be in the
booming economic capital of Shanghai, state press said Monday.


"We are sure to build a second park in China in the long run, but
we are now reviewing the market," Xinhua news agency quoted Wing
T. Chao, Disney's vice head of development in the Asian and
Pacific region, as saying.


Chao said the company had yet to decide on a location for its
second theme park in China after Hong Kong Disneyland opened in
September 2005, nor had any construction plans been formulated.


Last year, Disney held talks with the Shanghai government on a
possible theme park in the booming city, the report said.


Chao said that for the time being the company would focus on the
development and expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland.


He made the remarks at the China Hotel Summit 2007 in Beijing
where Disney's Hollywood Hotel in Hong Kong won China's Most
Representative Theme Hotel Prize, the report said.
