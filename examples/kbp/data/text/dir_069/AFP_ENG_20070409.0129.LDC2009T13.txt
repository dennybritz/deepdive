A 15-month-old girl who toddled onto a railway crossing near her
home at the foot of Mount Fuji survived with only minor injures
after being struck by a train Monday, police said.


The conductor slammed on the brakes on seeing the toddler but the
four-car train touched her just before coming to a halt at the
crossing in Fuji Yoshida, some 90 kilometres (60 miles) west of
Tokyo, police said.


"The train pushed her along the level crossing and dropped her
into a pit between the rails," Fuji Yoshida police spokesman
Kenichi Nagata said by telephone.


But the girl sustained only slight scratches on her head and
limbs in the mid- morning accident, the spokesman said.


The crossing, some 20 metres (yards) from the baby's home, had no
gate or alarm and her mother and grandmother were home when the
toddler ventured outside.


"We are withholding the name of the toddler for fear that her
family will be deluged with angry phone calls chiding them for
not taking good care of the baby," Nagata said.
