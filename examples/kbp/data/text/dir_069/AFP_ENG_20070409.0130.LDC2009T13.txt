Russian aluminium producer Rusal and the Russian nuclear energy
agency Rosatom said Monday they would begin to work on plans to
build a vast nuclear energy and metal processing plant in the
far-eastern Russia.


An agreement signed by both parties stated they had agreed to
carry out "a detailed exploration of the opportunities to create
an energy and metals complex in the Far East, notably a nuclear
power station and an aluminium blast furnace."


A feasability study for the project is to be carried out before
the end of the year, with a construction calendar to be defined
thereafter.


The statement did not give details of where the complex might be
located.
