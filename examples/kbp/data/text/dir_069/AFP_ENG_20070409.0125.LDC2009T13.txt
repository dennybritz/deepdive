Hong Kong's health officials issued a warning Monday against low-
tar cigarettes, telling smokers that they can be just as deadly
as full-strength smokes.


A department spokesman said that a survey of 93 cigarette brands
carried out by the department revealed that smokers of so-called
light cigarettes were no less at risk of smoke-related diseases
like lung cancer.


"When smokers choose cigarettes in this group instead of
cigarettes in the middle-tar or high-tar groups, they may take
larger and more frequent puffs or even smoke more cigarettes each
day," the spokesman said in a statement.


"Quitting smoking is the only way to reduce a smoker's risk of
developing heart diseases and cancers," the spokesman added.


Hong Kong on January 1 joined a growing number of cities when it
banned smoking in public places. However, as a two-year grace
period was granted to many pubs and restaurants, the difference
is as yet unnoticeable.


The survey showed that average nicotine levels in low-tar
cigarettes had risen slightly, while tar content had dropped a
tiny amount.


Hong Kong has relatively few smokers -- only about 14 percent, or
800,000 of the city's seven million people have the habit.


Nonetheless, a Hong Kong University study estimates that 1,324
non-smokers' deaths were caused last year from heart, vascular
and lung diseases, and cancers strongly associated with breathing
second-hand smoke.
