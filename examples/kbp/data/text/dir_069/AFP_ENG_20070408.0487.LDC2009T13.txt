China's leaders were to officially appoint Donald Tsang as Hong
Kong's chief executive for a second term on Monday.


Tsang was to receive a so-called "instrument of appointment" by
China's President Hu Jintao in Beijing's Great Hall of the
People.


He was also scheduled to meet the country's premier Wen Jiabao
and other state leaders in a series of ceremonies and meetings
that will confirm a re-selection vote he won last month.


The former British colony that was returned to China in 1997
exists as a largely autonomous capitalist territory within the
authoritarian Chinese state under a "one country, two systems"
arrangement.


Hong Kong's leaders are not elected democratically but by a
committee of 800 elites who are mostly loyal to China's communist
rulers in Beijing.


Tsang won the most recent vote in March, beating off lawmaker
Alan Leong in what was the first contested leadership race since
1997.


He has promised to begin moves to transform the political
landscape in Hong Kong, introducing more democracy in accordance
with the Basic Law constitution that came into force at the
handover.


Leong is a leading light in a reformist movement that has for the
past decade campaigned for a swift introduction of democracy,
while the China-backed government has been accused of halting the
process.
