Japan's KDDI Corp. plans to offer a mobile telephone service in
the United States targeting Japanese subscribers through the
network of a US operator, a company spokesman said Monday.


The company aims to offer the service, with the brand name "KDDI
Mobile", by using a network operated by Sprint Nextel Corp, the
spokesman said, confirming weekend media reports.


The move would make KDDI the first Japanese cellphone carrier to
launch its own brand overseas.


Japan's largest mobile phone service provider NTT DoCoMo Inc. has
also been expanding overseas, mostly by licensing agreements for
its popular "i-mode" Internet-capable mobile phone service.


NTT DoCoMo has also made capital investments in European and US
telecom firms, but has scrapped most of them after losses.


KDDI's overseas expansion comes amid growing competition at home
since October, when Japan began allowing mobile subscribers to
switch carriers without changing their numbers.
