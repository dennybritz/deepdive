The Dutch banking regulator has signalled it might approve the
break-up of ABN Amro, making the Dutch investment bank a more
attractive target for bidders, the Financial Times reported on
Monday.


ABN Amro has been in exclusive talks about a takeover deal with
Britain's Barclays Bank for the last three weeks, but analysts
have suggested that other groups might be able to pay more if
parts of ABN could be divested.


"It might be that a solid bank takes over and decides to
restructure," said Nout Wellink, the president of the Dutch
central bank, which regulates the Dutch banking market.


"Well, let them come to the supervisor, and we will look at it,
and when it looks fine there will be no problem whatsoever."


Investment bankers believe Royal Bank of Scotland could afford to
pay more for ABN Amro than Barclays if it was allowed to sell off
ABN's Brazilian operations to another lender, such as Spain's
Santander, the FT reported.


ABN shareholder The Children's Investment Fund (TCI), a British
hedge fund, has been pushing ABN management to break up the bank
and sell its parts to rivals.


TCI believes ABN Amro is worth more in parts, meaning the
divestment of its operations separately would create value for
shareholders.


Wellink had previously indicated in a Dutch newspaper that this
would be "a bridge too far."
