Authorities in Ukraine have arrested two suspects in the murder
of a Russian man believed linked to organised crime, who was shot
by a sniper as he left a Kiev court, security officials said
Saturday.


Maksim Kurochkin, known as "Mad Max", was shot last month as he
was getting into a police van in the inner courtyard of the court
building. He had only just been convicted of extortion.


The sniper had been located 300 metres (985 feet) away in a
neighbouring building.


Authorities did not release details of the suspects, including
their nationalities. The arrests were made in eastern
Dnipropetrovsk, Interfax news agency reported.


Ukrainian police believe Kurochkin, who was in his 40s, was a
senior figure in Russian organised crime. The country's
prosecutors had been investigating him on three separate charges
since March 2005.


As well as the extortion case, he was being investigated for
obtaining favours from the previous Ukrainian government that
gave him control over land and several sanatoriums in the
southern region of Crimea.


Last year, he admitted financing the electoral campaign of an
extreme left, pro- Russian political party in violation of
Ukrainian law.


Kurochkin had been in a Ukrainian jail since November 2006.
