Results of Saturday's race to take over from President Olusegun
Obasanjo as Nigeria's next head of state are expected Monday, the
head of the electoral commission said.


"We are hoping that we will get the result by Monday. That is our
target," said Maurice Iwu.


"I don't see any possible reason why we should not get the result
by Monday," he told a news conference.


Some 61.5 million Nigerians were eligible to vote Saturday to
elect a new president for four years in the first potential
civilian-to-civilian transfer of power since independence in
1960.


But a failed bombing against the electoral commission's offices
and shootings in other parts of the country, as well as delays in
getting ballot papers to polling booths, have marred hopes of a
trouble-free fair election.


Iwu earlier said all ballot papers had arrived at commission
headquarters in the country's 36 states and that "most have
already been distributed."


Voters were also due to elect 360 new members of the lower house
of parliament and 109 senators.
