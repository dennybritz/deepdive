An air and sea rescue operation was launched on Saturday after a
22-year-old British man went missing from an overnight ferry
travelling from Portsmouth to Saint-Malo, officials said.


A search plane was dispatched from Guernsey, in the Channel
Islands, to check the waters between the island of Jersey and
Saint-Malo, a port in northern France, where the man may have
fallen overboard.


A maritime police speedboat and a crew from the National Sea
Lifesaving Society (SNSM) also joined the search, which began at
around midday (1000 GMT), a spokeswoman for the maritime
authorities in Brest said.


The sea was calm during the Brittany Ferries overnight crossing,
she said.


The man was last seen in the early hours of Saturday morning, and
the three friends he was travelling with did not raise the alert
until the ferry docked in Saint-Malo at 08H15 (0600 GMT).


A police investigation has been opened.
