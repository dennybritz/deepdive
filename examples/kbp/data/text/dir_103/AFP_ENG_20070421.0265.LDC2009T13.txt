Racing was once again cancelled for the day, the fifth time in
six days this week, as low winds scuppered the Louis Vuitton Cup
here on Saturday.


The weather has played havoc with the schedule for the Cup
competition, the winner of which will take on holders Alinghi in
the America's Cup, due off in June.


Wind speeds reached no more than six knots on Saturday, just
short of the minimum seven required to allow racing to begin.


There was some racing on Friday, the only day to see some action,
with one of the favourites Emirates Team New Zealand suffering a
shock defeat to Italians Mascalzone Latino in the first regatta
of the day.
