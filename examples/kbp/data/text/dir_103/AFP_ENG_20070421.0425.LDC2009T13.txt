A pilot with the US Navy's Blue Angels aerobatics team died on
Saturday when his fighter jet crashed to the ground during an air
show in South Carolina, a local official said.


"The pilot was killed," an official with the coroner's office
told AFP, adding there were no other casualties.


She said the F-18 Hornet jet crashed in a wooded area near the
city of Beaufort.


The Beaufort Gazette newspaper said the plane appeared to have
struck a tall pine tree and traveled another block before
crashing near a heavily populated area.


"Something caught my eye, and all of a sudden I saw a huge, black
explosion," the daily quoted resident Jason Keith as saying.


"The plane went down, and we watched it for a while and I didn't
see any parachute or anything. If he had been 400 yards (meters)
to his right he would have plowed into the road," he said.


"The other guys were just flying along," he said in reference to
the other five planes in the formation.


Another witness said five of the jets "banked and the sixth made
a sharp turn behind the trees."


"We turned and looked back and just saw the smoke. We couldn't
see anything like flames, we just saw the smoke," Ray Edgemon
told South Carolina television station WLTX.


Based in Pensacola, Florida, the Blue Angels is a US Navy
precision flight team known for its daring aerobatic performances
and its distinctive blue-and-yellow fighter jets.


The squad was the main attraction at the April 21-22 air show
held at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort.
