A Tajik court sentenced three Uzbek nationals to up to 19 years
in prison on Saturday for "terrorist activities", a judicial
source said.


Two men were sentenced to 19 years in jail and the third was
given 18 years, as well as having his assets confiscated, the
source told AFP.


Their crimes included the "illegal passage over the frontier,
participation in terrorist organisations with the aim of
overturning the current order in Central Asia and creating an
Islamic caliphate".


The three men entered Tajikistan in 2004 and recruited local
residents into the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (MIO), the same
source said.


On April 10, Tajikistan police said they had arrested one of the
leaders of the MIO, which is classed as a terrorist organisation
by the United States.


They arrested 30 MIO fighters in total last year.


In 2001, an MIO training camp in Afghanistan was shelled by
American forces in an operation that killed the movement's
leader, Djouma Namangani.
