Voting stations started to close late Saturday in Nigeria's
landmark presidential election.


Stations where voting for a successor to President Olusegun
Obasanjo started on time in the morning closed around 1600 GMT.


In the northern city of Kano, journalists said that at some
stations where voters were already in the queue at 1600 GMT were
allowed to vote but newcomers were being turned away.


Some of the 120,000 polling stations closed before the scheduled
time saying they had run out of voting materials.


Officials at the Abuja headquarters of the national electoral
commission declined to confirm the end of the poll.


Official hours for the vote, held concurrently with elections for
a new National Assembly and Senate, were 0900-1600 GMT.


The legislative and senatorial votes were postponed in some parts
of the country due to printing errors on ballot papers for the
61.5 million eligible voters.
