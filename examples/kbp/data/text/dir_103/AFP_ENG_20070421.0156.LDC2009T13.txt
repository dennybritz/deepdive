The government of Ivory Coast said on Saturday it had suspended
two ministers in the new coalition cabinet from the country's
rebel group after they got into a fistfight this week.


A statement signed by new prime minister and former rebel chief,
Guillaume Soro, said the two ministers had brought disrepute upon
the government and broken the ministerial code of conduct.


Several local papers on Friday reported the fight that took place
in an Abidjan hotel between the two ministers, Moussa Dosso and
Youssouf Soumahoro.


Dosso had accused Soumahoro of having emptied out the offices
before switching positions in the new cabinet formed on April 7.


Soumahoro, previously minister of commerce and technical
training, completely cleaned out his former ministry, taking
"furniture, air conditioners, telephones, carpeting, flower
pots...," the Nord Sud newspaper reported.


Soro called the ministers' attitude "intolerable" and the two
have been suspended from cabinet meetings for a month as well as
being docked their salaries for that period, the government
statement said.


The new Ivorian government, formed only two weeks ago, includes
members of Soro's New Forces (FN) rebel movement in a bid to
reunite the west African nation which split in half in 2002 when
Soro mounted a failed coup against President Laurent Gbagbo.
