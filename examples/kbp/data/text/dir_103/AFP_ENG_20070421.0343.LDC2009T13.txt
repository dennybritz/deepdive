Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand will be sidelined for up
to two weeks after the recurrence of a groin injury, according to
manager Sir Alex Ferguson.


Ferdinand was forced off at half-time of his side's 1-1 draw
against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford on Saturday and will miss
several crucial games in United's treble chase, including both
legs of the Champions League semi-final against AC Milan.


Ferguson said: "It should be two weeks. He definitely won't be
available for Milan, but we expect to have him back for the
Chelsea game."


The England centre-back is just the latest in a long line of
United stars to be injured in recent weeks. Kieran Richardson
also sustained a knock against Middlesbrough and Gary Neville,
Nemanja Vidic, Mikael Silvestre, Louis Saha and Park Ji-Sung are
all still out.
