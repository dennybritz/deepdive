Clashes between Ethiopian troops and Islamist troops in the
Somali capital on Saturday left at least 52 civilians dead, and
brought the death toll to 165 from four days of fighting, a human
rights group said.


Sudan Ali Ahmed, chairman of the Elman Peace and Human Rights
Organisation, told AFP his group had collated figures from
hospitals, other humanitarian groups and counting bodies
abandoned in the streets.


"At least 52 civilians have been killed in today's fighting
alone, but we are yet to account for the number of those
wounded," Ahmed said.


"This brings the death toll to 165 people killed in four days of
fighting here."


"Today, the Ethiopian forces are using tanks and heavy mortars to
fight, they are shooting people house to house," he said.


"I do not know why the international community and the United
Nations are keeping quiet yet civilians are being slaughtered in
Mogadishu," Ahmed said.


Ahmed said hundreds of thousands of displaced did not have water,
food or medicine. "We are appealing to the international
community to come and rescue our people from this suffering."


"We have sent a message to both sides to stop fighting, but we
have not got any reply. We are requesting them to stop fighting
as soon as possible so that civilians can be helped," he added.


The UN refugee agency said more than 321,000 people have fled
Mogadishu since February 1.


The UN said Somali government forces were blocking relief
supplies and that  UN aircraft were being shot at.
