Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday began a two-day pastoral visit to
Lombardy, in northern Italy, celebrating an open-air mass in the
Renaissance town of Vigevano.


Thousands of people filled the Piazza Ducale outside Vigevano's
cathedral for the mass, in addition to crowds lining the route
taken by Benedict's "pope- mobile."


Following in the footsteps of Saint Augustine, the pope was to
head to nearby Pavia where his programme Sunday includes a
hospital visit, another open-air mass, a meeting with cultural
figures, and vespers.


Benedict will also visit the tomb of Saint Augustine, a fifth-
century theologian considered a father of the Latin Church whom
the pope quotes frequently in his writings and speeches.


The trip is Benedict's fourth in Italy since the start of his
papacy two years ago.


The pontiff will travel to Brazil next month.
