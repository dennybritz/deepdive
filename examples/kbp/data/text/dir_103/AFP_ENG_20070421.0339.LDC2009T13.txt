Russia's government has begun an investigation into last
weekend's protests against President Vladimir Putin that led to a
brutal crackdown, the interior ministry said Saturday.


"We are analysing everything that happened and we will do
everything possible to prevent similar situations in the future,"
interior ministry spokesman Valery Gribakin said.


The investigation is looking at the actions of both the
authorities and protesters, the spokesperson said.


"We sincerely regret it if peaceful citizens and journalists were
victims of agitators," Gribakin said.


He also accused some protesters of having shown false press cards
or sprayed their clothes with paint or ketchup to lead
journalists to believe they were victims of police brutality.


Hundreds were arrested as riot police forcefully broke up
demonstrations by The Other Russia movement in both Moscow and
Saint Petersburg last weekend.


AFP reporters at the rallies witnessed helmeted riot police
clubbing dozens of protestors. Several journalists were also
beaten.


Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, one of the leaders of
the opposition coalition, was among those detained.


The European Union and the United States have condemned the
crackdown.


German public television stations ARD and ZDF have protested to
Putin over the violent treatment of their correspondents by
police at the April 15 rally.
