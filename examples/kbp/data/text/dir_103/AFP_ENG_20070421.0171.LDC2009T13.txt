Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I've always thought he and Sachin Tendulkar have been the two
greatest batsmen I've ever played against, probably for different
reasons. Brian has got the ability to turn it on when he wants
and take an attack apart and Sachin has been the most techically
correct player I've seen."


- Australia captain Ricky Ponting on Brian Lara's retirement.


"If there is a positive, we haven't wasted a good performance."


- New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming on his team's 215-mauling
by the Australians in their last group game.


"The challenge of this new role excites me and I look forward to
meeting up with the players on their return to the United Kingdom
and to leading England to success in both Test and one-day
cricket."


- new England coach Peter Moores.


"We can take a lot of positives from this tournament. We have
earned respect from the opposition. It was good for us to qualify
for the second round from a tough group. We have shown we are
capable of beating big sides, but we need to be more consistent."


- Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar.


"Many of the critics have been wide of the mark in their
conclusions. I question whether double standards are being
applied here by some pundits."


- Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara on the decision to rest
Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas for the game against
Australia.
