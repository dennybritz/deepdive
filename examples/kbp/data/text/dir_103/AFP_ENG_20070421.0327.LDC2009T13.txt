Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday celebrated an open-air mass in the
Renaissance town of Vigevano at the start of a two-day pastoral
visit to Lombardy, in northern Italy.


Thousands of people filled the Piazza Ducale outside Vigevano's
cathedral for the mass, in addition to crowds lining the route
taken by Benedict's "pope- mobile."


"The family is the element that carries the life of society, and
it is only by acting in favour of the family that one can restore
the fabric of the ecclesiastical community and civil society,"
Benedict said in his homily.


He also called for attention to be paid to young people, both
"those who say they are close (to the Church) and those who are
said to be far away."


The pope was greeted in Vigevano by Italian Justice Minister
Clemente Mastella, a Catholic centrist.


Following in the footsteps of Saint Augustine, the head of the
Roman Catholic Church was to head to nearby Pavia where his
programme Sunday includes a hospital visit, another open-air
mass, a meeting with cultural figures, and vespers.


Benedict will also visit the tomb of Saint Augustine, a fifth-
century theologian considered a father of the Latin Church whom
the pope quotes frequently in his writings and speeches.


The trip is Benedict's fourth in Italy since the start of his
papacy two years ago.


Vigevano's Muslim community addressed a letter to Benedict in
which they hailed his "sincere will to launch a real dialogue for
better understanding with us Muslims and those who do not belong
to the Catholic Church".


The pontiff will travel to Brazil next month.
