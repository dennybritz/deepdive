Attacks by the public against Saudi Arabia's religious police,
who are in charge of enforcing a strict Islamic moral code in the
conservative kingdom, are on the rise, a newspaper reported on
Saturday.


Last year saw an increase in violence against the 5,000-plus
members of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and
Prevention of Vice, who came under more than 21 attacks, Al-Watan
said without giving figures for previous years.


The newspaper partly attributed the different views over the role
of the religious police, commonly known as Muttawa, to the
changes undergone by society since the force was founded several
decades ago.


Members of the public who spoke to the daily also cited the fact
that the religious police are involved in sensitive private
matters.


They sometimes suspect people of unethical behaviour when they
are in fact acting in accordance with Islamic tenets, leading to
embarrassing or humiliating situations, the paper reported.


The Muttawa are charged, among other things, with the task of
enforcing the segregation of men and women who are not related by
blood or marriage.


The Saudi interior ministry issued a decree in May 2006 aimed at
reining in the Muttawa by requiring them not to interrogate
detained suspects, as they previously did, but to hand them over
to police.
