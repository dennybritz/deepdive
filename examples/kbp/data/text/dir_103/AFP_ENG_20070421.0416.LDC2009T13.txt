Brian Lara bid an emotional farewell to international cricket on
Saturday but admitted he leaves the game with regrets that the
West Indies are still a struggling team.


Lara's 17-year career finished on a losing note when his team
were beaten by one wicket by England in their final World Cup
Super Eights match at a packed Kensington Oval.


Despite a career packed with 11,953 Test and 10,405 one-day runs
as well as twin batting records of a Test best 400 not out and
501 not out in first class cricket, he leaves the game with
regrets.


"Not all of my dreams have been fulfilled," said captain Lara who
made just 18 on Saturday before he was run out in the West Indies
total of 300.


"From the very first time I played cricket, my dream was to see
the West Indies back on top of the sport.


"Unfortunately, that hasn't happened and we haven't been able to
stop the decline. That's the most disappointing thing.


"I'm a team player. I have great hopes for the West Indies that
they will get back on top and whoever takes over from me needs to
have support. That would be tremendous."


Lara then asked the crowd: 'Did I entertain you?'. The huge
response told him what he wanted to hear.


"If I have entertained you then I am really happy. Thanks for
your support down the years.


"Today I have friends here from my school years and from
throughout my life. Thanks to everyone. I have enjoyed every
single minute of it."
