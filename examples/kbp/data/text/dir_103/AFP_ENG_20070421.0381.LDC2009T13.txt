A fire raged through a Faroe Islands factory ship fishing off the
coast of Chile on Saturday, killing 11 crew members, the company
operating the vessel said. A further 105 were rescued.


"The fire on board Hercules has cost 11 lives. One body has been
found and 10 have not been found," the Thor fishing company said
in a statement.


Four trawlers in the area took part in the rescue, Thor spokesman
Gunnbjoern Joensen told AFP.


The men were being transferred Saturday from the four ships to
another Thor- owned vessel in the area.


Thor said it would not disclose the nationalities and identities
of the victims until their families had been contacted.


Danish news agency Ritzau reported that the ship's captain and
second-in- command, both from the Faroe Islands, an autonomous
Danish territory, were among those rescued.


The trawler, which has large facilities to freeze fish, was
ravaged by the fire.


"Fire has spread throughout the vessel and the risk is that the
vessel cannot be saved," Thor said.


The cause of the blaze was not immediately known, according to
Joensen.
