Palestinians in the Gaza Strip fired a rocket at the southern
town of Sderot, medical and military sources said.


"A house in Sderot sustained a direct hit from a Qassam rocket.
Two people were taken to hospital with light wounds," a spokesman
for the Magen David Adom rescue services told AFP.


Four other people were treated for shock at the site, he said.


According to an army spokesman, Palestinians had fired three
