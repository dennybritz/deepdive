A Czech extreme right leader threatened payback on Saturday
against leftists he said were responsible for damage to the tomb
of a fascist general.


"One day payback will come and then they will be the first to
take responsibility," Patriotic Front head David Machacek said as
his organisation gathered at the Prague gravesite of General
Radola Gajda, who helped found the National Fascist Community in
1925.


The tombstone for the grave had been knocked down, among other
damage.


The gathering was among three extreme right demonstrations held
throughout the Czech Republic on Saturday, including about 500
people, police said.


Militants also gathered in Pilsen, about 80 kilometres (50 miles)
southwest of Prague, in support of a skinhead sentenced to 17
years in prison five years ago for the murder of a Roma.


In Kladno, west of Prague, hundreds of police officers separated
two groups of left- and right-wing extremists. The incident shut
down the center of the city for several hours.


Local media linked the demonstrations to the birthday of Adolf
Hitler, which was April 20, but protesters denied that was the
reason.
