The Bundesliga's top-scorer VfL Bochum's Theofanis Gekas has
signed a four-year contract with Bayer Leverkusen, their club
manager Rudi Voller revealed on Saturday.


The 26-year-old 14-times capped Greek international scored his
18th goal of the season in Bochum's 3-0 win at Eintracht
Frankfurt.


Gekas has been on a one-year loan at Bochum from Greek side
Panathinaikos.


A prolific scorer, Gekas was the Greek League's top goalscorer in
2005 with 17 goals and was runner-up in 2006 with 15.


Leverkusen boss Voller, whose side won 2-0 at home to Nuremberg,
did not disclose how much they will pay for Gekas, who has also
been chased by AS Roma.
