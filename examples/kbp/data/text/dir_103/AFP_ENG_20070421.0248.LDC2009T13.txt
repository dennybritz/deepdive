Brian Lara's last innings as an international cricketer ended
when he was run out for 18 in the World Cup Super Eights match
against England at the Kensington Oval here on Saturday.


The West Indies skipper, playing in his 299th and final one-
dayer, suffered a miserable exit.


With the total on 173-2 in the 31st over, Marlon Samuels pushed
the ball for a single, called Lara for a run but changed his mind
when Kevin Pietersen sprinted in from mid-on.


The England fielder threw the stumps down, Lara was stranded and
sent the great man back to the pavilion.


Lara came to the crease when opener Chris Gayle was dismissed for
79 with just one ball left of the 24th over.


The packed Kensington Oval ground rose to acclaim the 36-year-
old, he exchanged a high-five with Gayle while Michael Vaughan
and his England team formed a guard of honour as he arrived at
the crease.


Lara, the world record holder of the highest Test and first class
scores of 400 and 501 respectively, confidently fended off the
first ball he received from Andrew Flintoff.


He then took a single off the same bowler in the 26th over to get
his innings underway.


On 14, he was lucky to escape when Andrew Strauss just missed a
difficult chance in the slips after he had edged Flintoff.


But there was no second life for the West Indies great when
Samuels made his fatal call.
