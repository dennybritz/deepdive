US President George W. Bush will make a brief trip to Warsaw in
June for talks with Polish counterpart Lech Kaczynski on
proposals for a US anti-missile shield in Poland, a press report
said Saturday.


The daily Rzeczpospolita, quoting sources close to the Polish
presidency, said Bush's visit would follow the Group of Eight
(G8) summit taking place in neighbouring Germany from June 6-8.


The paper said the talks could take place in Kaczynski's private
residence at Jurata, along the Baltic Sea coast from the summit
venue of Heiligendamm.


Earlier this month the White House said Bush would play host to
Kaczynski, a conservative and close ally, on July 16.


The United States has asked the Czech Republic and Poland to host
a radar system and interceptor rockets respectively, purportedly
to counter missiles from North Korea or Iran, but the plan has
been sharply criticized by Russia.
