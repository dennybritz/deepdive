Defending champions Italy took a 2-0 lead in the Fed Cup World
Group first round tie here on Saturday after China's Shuai Peng
was forced to retire injured in her tie against Flavia Pennetta.


The Chinese number one held match points at 5-4 in the second
set, but pulled out in the third set with a left hamstring
injury, with Pennetta winning through 0-6, 7-5, 3-0.


Earlier Tathiana Garbin had put the hosts in front with a 6-4,
2-6, 6-3 victory over Sun Tian-Tian.


Italy are now just one point away from a semi-final place against
either France or Japan in July, with two singles and a doubles
tie slated for Sunday.
