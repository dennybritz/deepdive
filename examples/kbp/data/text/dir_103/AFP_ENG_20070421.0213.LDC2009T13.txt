Thousands protested on Saturday here in support of self-
determination for the disputed territory of Western Sahara, while
criticising the Spanish government's position on the issue.


"It's not autonomy that is needed, but self-determination,"
leftist leader Gaspar Llamazares told Europa Press agency during
the protest.


The demonstration was organised by groups in favor of a
referendum on Western Saharan independence.


Morocco has proposed an autonomy referendum instead that
envisages giving Sahrawis "control over their affairs through
legislative, executive and judicial institutions" under Moroccan
sovereignty.


Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's government
has said the Moroccan proposal could lead to new dialogue and
help overcome the current impasse.


Llamazares said the Spanish government, the former colonial power
in the region, has "changed camps" to support Morocco's position.


Diplomats said on Friday that the UN Security Council is likely
to endorse next week a call for direct talks between Morocco and
the separatist Polisario Front on their rival plans for the
disputed area.


Morocco annexed the desolate northwest African territory after
the withdrawal of Spain and neighbor Mauritania in the 1970s,
settling it with around 300,000 Moroccans in 1975.


A war ensued with the Algerian-backed Polisario Front, an armed
group which contested Rabat's sovereignty, that ended in 1991
with a UN-brokered cease-fire.
