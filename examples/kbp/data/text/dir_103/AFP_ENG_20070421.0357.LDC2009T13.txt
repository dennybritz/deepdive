Lyon's sixth consecutive title win on Saturday is the first time
that a French side has achieved such a feat in a championship
that dates back to 1932.


Last year nearly to the day, they became the first side to win
five times in succession.


Marseille did win five in a row from 1989-93, but the final
championship win was later cancelled after the corruption/bribing
scandal that engulfed the club concerning a match against
Valenciennes


The only other side to win four in a row was the great St Etienne
side under Robert Herbin from 1967-1970


Lyon's six title triumphs from 2002 was acheived under three
different managers - Jacques Santini for the first, Paul Le Guen
for the next three and Gerard Houllier for the fifth and sixth.
