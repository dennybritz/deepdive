South African police said Saturday they had found 12 women and
two children from Zimbabwe locked in a house north of
Johannesburg, after their kidnapper was arrested and gave up
their location.


The man was caught trying to collect a ransom for a 17-year-old
girl he kidnapped this week, police spokesman Lungelo Dlamini
said.


He had offered the girl a ride to the Beit Bridge border post
between South Africa and Zimbabwe but instead called her mother
and demanded a ransom of 300 rand (31 euros, 43 US dollars),
which he later raised tenfold.


On Saturday the victim's mother went to a service station in the
poor Ivory Park area of the city where she said she would pay
him.


But she was accompanied by police, who arrested the suspect. He
then took them to the house where the 14 hostages were being kept
in a single room.


"They were all hungry," Dlamini said according to the SAPA news
agency, adding that the women and children were being kept in a
secure place until the end of the investigation.


The police believe other people have been kidnapped from the
Zimbabwean border by the suspect, who they say demanded at least
1,000 rand (100 euros, 140 US dollars) from victims' relatives in
South African for their release.


He will appear in court on Monday, and faces charges of
kidnapping and breaking immigration laws.
