England were 122-2 after 20 overs in their last World Cup Super
Eights match against West Indies at the Kensington Oval on
Saturday chasing 301 to win.


Michael Vaughan was on 62 with Kevin Pietersen on 15.


Andrew Strauss was the first man out caught by Devon Smith off
Corey Collymore for seven with the total on 11 in the third over.


Ravi Bopara was the second man out run out by Dwayne Bravo for 26
with the score on 101 in the 16th over.


Earlier Chris Gayle smashed three sixes and 10 fours in a 58-ball
79 for his first half-century of the tournament as the West
Indies made 300.


Gayle put on 131 for the opening wicket with Devon Smith (61),
who played a supporting role remarkably well before falling to a
superb one-handed catch by Paul Collingwood at point off paceman
Andrew Flintoff.


Marlon Samuels (51) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (34) also made
merry.


Skipper Brian Lara, playing his last match before retirement,
made a 17-ball 18 before being run out while responding to a call
from a hesistant Marlon Samuels.


Samuels initially charged for a single after pushing paceman
Stuart Broad to mid-on before changing his mind. Lara was out of
the crease when Kevin Pietersen hit the stumps at the non-
striker's end with an underarm throw.


Lara had arrived at the crease to a thunderous applause from a
capacity crowd and was given a guard of honour by the England
team.


Neither West Indies nor England can reach the semi-finals after
suffering dismal campaigns.
