Romania's interim President Nicolae Vacaroiu began his first day
on the job Saturday with a meeting of advisers at the
presidential palace, after parliament voted to suspend Traian
Basescu.


Vacaroiu asked the heads of each department in the president's
office to inform him of "all urgent problems" and announced a new
meeting for Monday.


The handing over of powers occurred without ceremony late Friday
after Basescu, whom parliament had voted to suspend the previous
day, announced he would not resign as president, contrary to an
earlier statement.


The 63-year-old Vacaroiu, an economist and head of the senate,
was prime minister from 1992 to 1996 under then president Ion
Iliescu during a period which analysts say was characterised by
slackening economic reforms.


Vacaroiu, a member of the opposition Social Democrat party which
led the move to suspend Basescu, will act as interim president
until a referendum on his predecessor's impeachment is held. This
should occur by mid-May.


Basescu, who was elected in December 2004, is the first Romanian
president to be suspended since the fall of Communism in 1989.
Iliescu escaped similar sanctions in 1994 after he was accused of
meddling in judicial matters.
