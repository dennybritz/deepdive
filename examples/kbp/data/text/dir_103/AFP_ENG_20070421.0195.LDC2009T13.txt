China scored in the last minute to beat the Women's World Stars
3-2 on Saturday in an action-packed prelude to this year's World
Cup.


Four headed goals in an entertaining first half gave way to a
gritty second period with substitute Ji Ting sliding home the
winner with just seconds to go.


"This game will give us a lot of confidence for the World Cup in
September," said Liu Sa, who got China's opener.


With new coach Marika Domanski-Lyfors watching the exhibition
match from the stands, China were keen to impress ahead of the
World Cup they will host in September.


But it was the talented World Stars who took the lead when
Germany's Conny Pohlers directed a downward header through the
fumbling grip of 'keeper Zhang Yanru.


China hit back and claimed the lead as Liu and rising star Han
Duan both headed in from corners.


However the World Stars levelled through Australian defensive
rock Cheryl Salisbury, who flung herself at a free-kick from
Brazilian Daniela to nod the equaliser on 42 minutes.


The carnival atmosphere turned ugly after the break when Lotta
Schelin's knee connected with Zhou Gaoping's face, causing a
bloody injury that forced her from the field.


As tensions rose, American substitute Kristine Lilly fired at the
'keeper from close range and Schelin had a late shot tipped over
before Ji Ting's late clincher.


"Today's game was a great day for women's soccer -- we had five
goals and it was really exciting for the fans," said Lilly.


The match was a prelude to Sunday's World Cup draw, when 16
countries will be split into four groups for the September 10-30
tournament.
