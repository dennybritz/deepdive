The Democratic Republic of Congo's army and UN forces in Uganda
will monitor the movement of northern rebels to an agreed camp in
southern Sudan ahead of peace talks, officials said Saturday.


Ugandan army chief General Aronda Nyakairima, his DRC counterpart
Kisempia Sungilanga Lombe and Babacar Gaye from the UN's MONUC
agreed to this arrangement at a meeting in Kampala.


The DRC army with MONUC support will monitor and verify "the
movement of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) to designated area
of Ri-Kwangba," camp in southern Sudan, according to a joint
statement.


MONUC and the Congolese army will "report any movement to the
contrary," it added.


The Ugandan government and the LRA early this month renewed a
ceasefire and agreed to resume peace talks to end a brutal, two-
decade insurgency in northern Uganda.


The LRA fighters believed to be hiding in eastern DRC, southern
Sudan and northern Uganda will gather at Ri-Kwangba camp in
southern Sudan ahead of the resumption of peace talks on April 26
in the region's capital Juba.


The Kampala meeting, facilitated by MONUC was reviewing the
situation along the DRC-Uganda border and discuss "the presence
of negative forces in the DRC that constitute a threat to Uganda
and DRC".


The Ugandan rebellion has raged since 1988, when the LRA leader
Joseph Kony took over leadership of a two-year-old regional
rebellion among northern Uganda's ethnic Acholi minority.
