Richard Jefferson scored 28 points and former Toronto star Vince
Carter added 16 to spark New Jersey past Toronto 96-91 here
Saturday in a National Basketball Association playoff opener.


Carter made only 5-of-16 shots as Raptors supporters booed their
former hero, but he scored nine points in the fourth quarter to
help the Nets capture the first game of their Eastern Conference
opening-round best-of-seven series.


The Raptors made a 17-6 run to begin the fourth quarter but the
Nets held off their hosts, thanks in part to a playoff career
high 16 points by Bostjan Nachbar of Slovenia and 11-of-21
shooting by Jefferson.


"We understand with this much emotion ionvolved they were going
to make a run," Jefferson said, adding that New Jersey's depth
offset Carter's struggles.


"We're a team. It's not just about him. Even if someone has an
off night, down the line we will play great."


Chris Bosh scored 22 points to lead the Raptors, who also had 21
points from T.J. Ford and 16 more from Anthony Parker.


The Raptors, who will try to even the series here Tuesday,
rallied within 83-82 with 4:08 remaining


Nachbar scored five points in the final 2:40 and Carter had four,
including a layup and two free throws that kept the Raptors from
taking the ball with a chance to pull even.
