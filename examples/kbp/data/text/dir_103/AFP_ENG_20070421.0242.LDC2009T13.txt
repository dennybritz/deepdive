Idrissa Traore has been fired as coach of Burkina Faso, reports
said on Saturday.


He survived less than one year of his contract after a poor
showing by the 'Stallions' in the African Nations Cup qualifying
competition.


After beginning a six-match campaign with a 2-1 loss in Tanzania,
Burkina Faso beat Senegal 1-0 before being surprisingly held 1-1
by Mozambique in another home match.


These results left the landlocked west African nation two points
adrift of leaders Senegal at the halfway stage, but only group
winners are guaranteed a place at the 2008 Nations Cup in Ghana.


A national football federation statement said it had lost
confidence in the coach and assured the public a replacement will
be recruited quickly to prepare for the return match against
Mozambique during June.


Traore is the second national coach to lose his job in Africa
this week after Frenchman Noel Tosi was sacked by Congo for
allegedly breaking several conditions of his contract.
