Jet Airways of India is to launch a European hub at Brussels
airport for flights into and out of Europe, the company said in a
statement.


The new arrangement has been facilitated through a new code-
sharing agreement between the Mumbai-registered company and
Belgium's Brussels Airlines.


The code-sharing deal will be signed by Jet Airways president
Naresh Goyal and Brussels Airline chief Philippe Vander Putten in
the Belgian capital on May 2 at a ceremony to be attended by By
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt.


The formal announcement of the hubbing arrangement will be made
at the same time.


The moves will allow Jet Airways to spread its wings across
Europe, where currently it only flies to London's Heathrow, and
also into the United States and Canada.


"The hub will allow us to offer a more efficient, high-quality
service linking India with Europe, the United States and Canada,"
the company said in a statement.


The private Indian carrier, created in 1993, currently flies to
some 50 destinations in the Indian subcontinent and Asia, plus
its London flights. It intends to gradually extend its
international operations into North America, Europe, Africa and
other Asian destinations.
