A prominent Muslim cleric in Indian Kashmir Saturday ended his
three-day hunger strike after authorities assured him they would
shut the only liquor shop in south of the state, officials said.


Qazi Ahmed Yasir, the head cleric in the southern Kashmir
district of Anantnag, vowed Thursday not to eat until authorities
close down the recently opened shop in neighbouring Khanabal
area.


"A top official of the district assured Mirwaiz (Yasir) that the
liquor seller's licence, which expires by the end of this month,
will not be renewed," a district police officer said.


"The cleric has ended his three-day fast," he said.


Muslim militants closed down liquor shops, beauty parlours and
cinemas in Kashmir in 1990, a year after launching a deadly
insurgency against Indian rule in the scenic Himalayan region.


Only one liquor shop is operational in the state summer capital
Srinagar, but in a high security zone.
