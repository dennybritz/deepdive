Serena and Venus Williams each won in straight sets here Saturday
to give the United States a 2-0 lead over Belgium in their Fed
Cup first round tie.


Five-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams opened with a 7-5,
6-2 triumph over Kirsten Flipkens while reigning Australian Open
champion Serena Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam winner,
defeated Caroline Maes 6-1, 6-4.


The triumphs put the US on the brink of advancing to July's semi-
final tie against either Russia or Spain. Belgium would need an
unlikely sweep of Sunday's reverse singles matches as well as a
doubles triumph to advance.


Venus Williams needed only 69 minutes to post a victory. She hit
34 of 56 first serves and lost only seven points when connecting
on her first serve.


Serena Williams took 65 minutes in her victory, never allowing
Maes a break point. While connecting on only 24 of 50 first
serves, the younger Williams sister won 19-of-24 first serve
points, 26-of-29 second-serve points and fired five aces against
only three double faults.
