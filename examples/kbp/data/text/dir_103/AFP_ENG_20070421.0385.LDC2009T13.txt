One of six US Navy aircraft participating in a precision flying
show crashed Saturday in Beaufort, South Carolina, CNN reported,
citing sources and eyewitnesses.


Local television station WSAV confirmed a Blue Angel jet had gone
down in Beaufort.


CNN said some houses were on fire.


Scott Houston, who was watching the jet show from a boat on a
river, told CNN he saw six jets flying in formation when one of
them disappeared.


"A large cloud of black smoke came up from behind the tree
lines," Houston said.
