A strong 6.2-magnitude earthquake shook southern Chile Saturday
near the border with Argentina, the US Geological Survey said.


The epicenter of the 38-kilometer (24-mile) deep quake was 45 km
(30 miles) northwest of Coihaique, Chile, and 270 km (170 miles)
west of Sarmiento, Argentina, the USGS said.


It was located 1320 km (820 miles) south of Chile's capital
Santiago.


The reading was based on the open-ended Moment Magnitude scale,
which measures the area of the fault that ruptured and the total
energy released.


A measurement of five indicates a moderate earthquake, six or
higher a strong quake, seven a major quake and eight a great
quake.
