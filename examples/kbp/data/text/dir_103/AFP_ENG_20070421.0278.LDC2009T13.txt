Twice world footballer of the year Ronaldinho was a welcome
addition to the Barcelona squad for Sunday's trip to Villarreal.


The Brazilian has missed Barca's last two matches with tonsilitis
but returned to training on Wednesday, alongside French forward
Ludovic Giuly and goalkeeper Victor Valdes.


According to Spanish newspaper Marca, Ronaldinho has lost four
kilos during his lay-off. He had earlier in the season been
accused of putting on weight.
