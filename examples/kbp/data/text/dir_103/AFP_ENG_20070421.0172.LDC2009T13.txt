Tennis balls, 10-year-old aluminum cans and neon tubes were among
more than a tonne of junk collected in recent days on the tiny
Polynesian atoll bought by Marlon Brando in the 1960s, the
actor's son said.


The garbage had washed ashore with the tides, and Teihotu Brando
made the Friday announcement as a way of drawing attention to
pollution and other types of environmental destruction.


The cleaning of the 13 miniscule islands belonging to the French
Polynesian Tetiaroa atoll took three days and was done in
conjunction with Earth Day, which is Sunday. Members of
environmental organisation Te Mana O Te Moana (Spirit of the
Ocean) joined in the project.


The atoll is located northwest of Tahiti and collects "all the
floating symbols of consumer society," said Cecile Gaspar, head
of surveillance for sea bird colonies on the atoll. Tetiaroa is
known for its bird diversity.


Some cans collected during the clean up had expiration dates on
them from 10 years ago and remained in good condition, Gaspar
said.


Brando, star of the famed "Godfather" films among others, died in
2004. Teihotu Brando is today the sole guardian of Tetiaroa,
where boats regularly deliver supplies to him when they come to
fish around the atoll.
