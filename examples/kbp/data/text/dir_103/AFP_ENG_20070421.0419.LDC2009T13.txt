One person died when a fighter jet of the US Navy's Blue Angels
aerobatics team crashed to the ground Saturday during an air show
in South Carolina, local media reported.


A spokesman for the Florida-based Blue Angels squad confirmed the
crash occurred during the air show at Beaufort but did not
immediately release further details.


Media in South Carolina said one person died, but that it was not
immediately clear whether the victim was the pilot of the F-18
Hornet jet.


At least one house was set on fire, media said.


Scott Houston, who was watching the jet show from a boat on a
river, told CNN he saw six jets flying in formation when one of
them disappeared.


"A large cloud of black smoke came up from behind the tree
lines," Houston said.


The Blue Angels is a US Navy precision flight team known for its
daring aerobatic performances.
