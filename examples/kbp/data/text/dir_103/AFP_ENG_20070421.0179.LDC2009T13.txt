More than 400 students whose families come from the Israeli-
occupied Golan Heights held a protest in Damascus on Saturday
over the "inhuman" conditions in which fellow Syrians are being
held in Israel.


"Freedom for the prisoners," read banners raised by the
demonstrators, who gathered in front of the offices of the
International Committee of the Red Cross.


A student group charged that most of the Syrians from the Golan
Heights being held in Israel "suffer from chronic illnesses
because of the inhuman conditions of their incarceration."


Four of the 15 Syrians being held in Israel have served more than
22 years, the Golan Students League said.


"Sodki Makt, Sitan Wali, Basher Makt and Assem Abdel Wali are
being held in individual cells and deprived of family visits,
even as their health deteriorates badly," it said.


The students called for the United Nations and human rights group
to ensure the prisoners do not suffer the same fate as Hayel Abu
Zeid who died in July of cancer after spending 21 years behind
bars.


They also criticised a lack of support from the Syrian
government.


More than 18,000 Syrians, most of them Druze, live on the Golan
Heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war and
annexed in 1981. The vast majority of them have refused to take
Israeli nationality.
