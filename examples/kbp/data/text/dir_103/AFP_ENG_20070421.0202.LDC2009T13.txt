Israeli troops shot dead three Palestinian militants during a
raid on Saturday in the West Bank town of Jenin, Palestinian
security and medical sources said.


Israeli special forces opened fire on a car, killing Abbas al-
Damaj and Ahmad Ayassa from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a
militant offshoot of president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah movement.


A third militant from the radical group Islamic Jihad died of his
wounds shortly after being hit in the same incident, the sources
said.


The Israeli army said that "during an operation in Jenin, a
border police special force identified three militants firing at
them and returned fire, hitting the three."


The deaths brought to 5,664 the overall toll since the eruption
of the current Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the vast
majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP count.


Earlier on Saturday, Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian
policeman, 23-year- old Mohammed Abed, during an operation in
Jenin.
