National Hockey League scoring leader Sidney Crosby will not play
for Canada in the upcoming World Championships because he has
played with a broken left foot for the past month.


Crosby revealed the injury on Saturday, two days after his
Pittsburgh Penguins were ousted by Ottawa in the first round of
the Stanley Cup playoffs, dropping the best-of-seven series in
five games.


The 19-year-old superstar center led the NHL with 120 points and
led all players in last year's World Championships with 16 points
in nine games, although Canada failed to reach the podium after
titles in 2003 and 2004 and second in 2005.


The world tournament begins Friday in Moscow.


"It would have been a huge thrill for me to play for Team Canada
again, especially in Moscow, which is a place I've always wanted
to play," Crosby said.


Crosby said the injury happened March 16 when he blocked a
slapshot, but the prodigy did not miss any time and helped the
Penguins reach the playoffs for the first time since 2001.


"I think it happened when we played Montreal," Crosby said. "It
didn't really affect my play. Maybe the first couple weeks, on
the perimeter not blocking shots, but after the first couple
weeks, it didn't have any effect."


Crosby expects to be fit in time for training camp with the
Penguins in September.


"It just needs time," he said. "It doesn't change anything. I'm
going to get a good month of rest and I'm pretty confident I'll
be fine after that."
