Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Saturday told visiting
Australian Defence Minister Brandan Nelson that the Baghdad
security plan was going in the right direction despite
challenges.


A number of high-profile car bombings killed more than 200 people
this week in Baghdad where some 80,000 Iraqi and US troops are
implementing a security plan on the capital's mean streets.


"The security plan currently in action is going in the right
direction despite the challenges," Maliki told Nelson, who was
making a surprise visit to Baghdad.


Nelson's visit came a day after US Defence Secretary Robert Gates
wound up a two-day trip to check on the progress of the
crackdown.


A statement from Maliki's office said the prime minister also
stressed during the meeting that Iraqis were keen "in
accelerating the handover of their country's affairs and to rely
on themselves."


Maliki further urged increased cooperation with Australia in
areas of trade and economy.


Nelson pledged Australia's "full support" for the Iraqi
government, particularly in developing the country's dilapidated
infrastructure.


"Our country is intent to play a bigger role in the
reconstruction drive that is currently on in Iraq," the statement
quoted Nelson as saying.


Australia has around 1,400 troops in Iraq, of which 550 are
combat troops and largely deployed in the relatively calm south
of the country alongside British forces.
