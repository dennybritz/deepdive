A double from Portuguese striker Pauleta lifted Paris Saint
Germain to a 4-0 win over relegation-rivals Nantes on Saturday, a
victory which could prove vital to the Parisians' bid to beat the
drop.


Rockbottom Nantes, however, look set for the second division next
season just six years after they won the last of their domestic
titles, as the side from southern Brittany showed a lack of
fighting spirit during a tie in which they rarely threatened
their hosts.


Pauleta - who had been left out of the starting team for the past
few matches - opened with a superb free kick taken after 17
minutes with midfielder Jerome Rothen finding the net for the
first time this season two minutes before the break.


Pauleta claimed his second on 65 and a minute later helped Peguy
Luyindula score the fourth which compounded the misery of Nantes.


PSG now have 38 points with five more matches to play.


Coach Paul Le Guen believes that his side need 43 points to
survive, but the Parisians face a tough end to the season with
ties against highflying Toulouse, leaders and almost certainly
champions Lyon, Nice, Troyes and Lorient on the cards.


Only a miracle can save the Canaries who look set for the drop
for the first time since their first division adventure began in
1963.
