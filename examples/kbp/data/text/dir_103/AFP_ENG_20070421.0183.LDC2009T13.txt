US President George W. Bush Saturday thanked Australian Prime
Minister John Howard, a top US ally, for cooperation in the "war
on terror," a White House spokesman said.


"President Bush spoke with Prime Minister Howard of Australia
this morning in a wide ranging call on global and regional
issues," national security council spokesman Gordon Johndroe
said.


Bush "thanked Prime Minister Howard for his leadership role is
the global war on terror. They discussed the situations in Iraq,
Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iran (and) they affirmed their
optimism that the international community can resolve these
difficult issues by maintaining unity of purpose."


The US president "thanked the Prime Minister for the decision of
Australia to send additional troops to help secure the peace in
Afghanistan and for Australia's steadfast and important
commitment in Iraq."


Australia announced earlier this month that it would nearly
double its military force in Afghanistan to 1,000 troops, warning
that the war against a resurgent Taliban would not be won without
extra effort.


Separately, "Bush fully endorsed Prime Minister Howard's
initiative to place the issue of clean development and climate
change on the agenda for the APEC leaders summit in Sydney in
September."


Howard said last month he was making climate change a key agenda
item at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
