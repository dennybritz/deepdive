Almost half of Uganda's lawmakers oppose a controversial proposal
to allow forest land to become a sugarcane plantation, a
newspaper reported Saturday.


A poll of 200 of the 332 members of parliament found that 81
percent, or 162 MPs in total, were against President Yoweri
Museveni's plan, state-owned daily New Vision reported.


The project would see nearly a quarter of the 30,000-hectare
(75,000-acre) Mabira Forest Reserve east of Kampala handed over
to India's Mehta Group to grow sugar cane.


The government needs a simple majority in parliament to pass the
measure but the proposal has angered conservationists and
opposition lawmakers.


On April 12, at least three people were killed in a demonstration
to preserve the forest. Last week, Ugandan police fired live
bullets and tear gas canisters and arrested 23 people in a
similar protest.


Of those who rejected Museveni's plans in the poll, 72 percent
were from his governing National Resistance Movement party.


Museveni defended the plan in a newspaper article on Friday,
saying it would lead to industrial development and create jobs in
the impoverished nation.


Conservationists have warned that further encroachment of the
forest would threaten up to 312 species of trees, 287 bird
species and nearly 200 kinds of butterflies.
