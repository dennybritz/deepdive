Barry Bonds hit his 739th career home run here Saturday, moving
closer to Hank Aaron's all-time Major League Baseball record of
755 homers with a blast that lifted San Francisco past Arizona
1-0.


Bonds was the leadoff hitter in the home half of the second
inning when he smashed his fifth homer of the three-week-old
season over the centerfield wall off Diamondbacks' pitcher Edgar
Gonzalez.


The 42-year-old slugger is now 17 home runs shy of surpassing
Aaron's all-time mark of 755. His latest homer lifted the Giants
to 8-8 this season.


Bonds' heroics have been tainted by accusations of steroids
although he has denied any wrongdoing and never tested posititve.


But Bonds's trainer, Greg Anderson, was among five men convicted
in the BALCO steroid scandal and for much of Bonds's career Major
League Baseball did not test for performance-enhancing drugs.
