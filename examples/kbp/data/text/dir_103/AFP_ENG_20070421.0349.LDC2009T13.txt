The Turkish and Greek prime ministers will this summer inaugurate
a new pipeline bringing natural gas from Azerbaijan and other
Caucasus producers, the Greek development minister said on
Saturday.


"In July, prime ministers (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan and (Costas)
Karamanlis (are expected) to inaugurate the flow of natural gas
from Turkey to Greece," Dimitris Sioufas told state television
NET from Ankara.


Stretching over 300 kilometres (186 miles), the pipeline is due
to start bringing natural gas to European countries this summer.


It is subsequently planned to extend to southern Italy, with work
on an additional stretch running 220 kilometres (140 miles)
underwater and overland across Greek territory due to begin next
year.


A tripartite agreement between Greece, Turkey and Italy to extend
the pipeline will be signed in the coming months, NET said. The
pipeline extension is scheduled to be ready by 2011.


Sioufas was in Ankara for talks with Turkish Energy Minister
Hilmi Guler.


"We discussed the connection of electricity networks between
Turkey and Greece, an ongoing project that we hope will be
completed on our side by January 2008," he said.


Greece is seeking alternative electricity providers after the
shutdown of two Bulgarian nuclear reactors at the power plant of
Kozloduy sharply cut energy imports from that country.


"We are still 35 percent lower in terms of reserves than last
year, but this is not a cause for concern," the Greek energy
ministry's general secretary Nikos Stefanou told NET.
