Eleven crewmen were killed in a fire Saturday on board a Faroe
Islands fishing trawler in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
Chile and 105 others were rescued, the Thor fishing company said.


"The fire on board Hercules has cost 11 lives. One body has been
found and 10 have not been found," the company said in a
statement.
