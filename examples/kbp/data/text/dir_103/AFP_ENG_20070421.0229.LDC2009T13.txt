Tatiana Golovin brushed aside Akiko Morigami in straight sets to
put hosts France 2-0 up against Japan in their Fed Cup World
Group first round tie here on Saturday.


Golovin, who has taken over as team leader as world number three
Amelie Mauresmo recovers from appendicitis, won 6-2, 6-4 after
Nathalie Dechy earlier beat Japan's top-ranked player Ai Sugiyama
7-5, 6-1.


The 19-year-old Golovin has moved up to world number 18 after
winning her first career title earlier this month at Amelia
Island.


And the teenager gave 27-year-old Morigami no chance to avenge
her loss in her only previous meeting with the Frenchwoman at the
2004 US Open.


The French are now just one match away from booking a spot in
July's semi-finals against either Italy or China.


Golovin is slated to meet Sugiyama and Dechy with Morigami in
Sunday's reverse singles which will be followed by the doubles
where Golovin teams up with Severine Bremond and Sugiyama with
Ayumi Morita.
