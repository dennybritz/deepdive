Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Saturday called on the
European Union to lift a year-long suspension of direct aid to
his Hamas-led government, arguing that the lack of funds
threatens to encourage extremism.


"We call upon the European Union to lift the embargo imposed on
our people, whose continuation will only succeed in encouraging
extremism," Abbas told reporters after a meeting with Greek
Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis.


"The Palestinian people must be assisted to live a normal life."


The European Union was the biggest aid donor to the Palestinian
government until the Hamas militants came to power in March 2006.


The Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the EU, the United
States, the United Nations and Russia -- then suspended direct
aid to the Palestinian Authority.


"We recently formed a government of national unity, its agenda
has been announced and we believe that it corresponds to all
expectations," said Abbas.


He is in Greece for a three-day visit as part of a European tour
designed to press for the resumption of direct funding.


He added that conditions were ripe to "carry out the vision of US
President (George) Bush and the Quartet to create an independent
Palestinian state".


Greece has traditionally pursued friendly relations with the
Palestinians, a policy spearheaded by late Socialist prime
minister Andreas Papandreou, who was a personal friend of late
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
