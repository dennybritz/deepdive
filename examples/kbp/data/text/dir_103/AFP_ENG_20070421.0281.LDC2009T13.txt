US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has reiterated his call for a
strong dollar while urging China to let its currency appreciate
faster against the greenback.


"As I think you know, I believe very strongly that a strong
dollar is in our nation's interest," Paulson said in an interview
late Friday with PBS television.


Paulson's comments came after European Central Bank president
Jean-Claude Trichet reiterated Friday that excessive exchange
rate volatility was "undesirable," as the euro flirted with all-
time highs against the dollar.


The euro rose as high as high 1.3637 dollars in trading early
Friday, flirting with its record of 1.3666 dollars set on
December 30, 2004.


Paulson called for China to let the yuan appreciate more against
the dollar to ease protectionist tendencies in Congress amid a
persistent US trade deficit with China.


Congress could pass "unattractive bills," he warned, adding: "I
think the Chinese are very well aware of it."


China has a huge trade surplus largely thanks to a weak yuan that
makes its products highly competitive abroad.
