Barry Bonds hit his 739th career home run here Saturday, moving
closer to Hank Aaron's all-time Major League Baseball record of
755 homers with his second inning blast against Arizona.


Bonds was the leadoff hitter in the home half of the second
innings when he smashed his fifth homer of the three-week-old
season over the centerfield wall off Diamondbacks' pitcher Edgar
Gonzalez, giving the Giants a 1-0 edge.


The 42-year-old slugger is now 17 home runs shy of surpassing
Aaron's all-time mark of 755.


The Giants are 7-8 this season, four games behind the pace-
setting Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West division.
Arizona's record is 10-8.


Bonds's heroics have been tainted by accusations of steroids
although he has denied any wrongdoing and never tested posititve.


But Bonds's trainer, Greg Anderson, was among five men convicted
in the BALCO steroid scandal and for much of Bonds's career,
Major League Baseball did not test for performance-enhancing
drugs.
