British police are investigating a global credit card scam,
allegedly linked to Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels, which has
conned thousands of British motorists out of cash, the BBC
reported Saturday.


BBC television said that the Sri Lankan government has claimed
that its opponents, the Tamil Tigers, are behind the scam.


Complaints are currently being investigated in Edinburgh, Leeds,
Nottingham, Bristol, Hull, Norwich, Peterborough and Bury St
Edmunds, according to the BBC, which added that 200 of Britain's
9,500 petrol stations have been hit.


Tamil asylum seekers arriving in Britain are obtaining the card
information and sending it to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE), said Maxwell Keegel, first secretary of the Sri
Lankan High Commission in London.


"This police investigation on this scam involving the LTTE has
been going on for some time," Keegel told AFP, adding that "huge
sums" of money were involved.


"Even in parts of the UK where there aren't Asians living, you
will find that the petrol stations ... are owned by Sri Lankan
Tamils."


"That is because the LTTE loans money to these asylum seekers who
come here to buy up petrol stations ... in a very organised
manner.


He added: "Because of chip and PIN, since you cannot use the
credit card details that you have scammed in the UK, the money is
withdrawn in Thailand which is where the LTTE's procurement arm
operates from."
