France's Sebastien Bourdais claimed the pole position for
Sunday's Champ-car Grand Prix of Houston by leading the
qualifiers in Saturday's final time trials session.


Three-time defending season points champion Bourdais completed
the 1.69-mile street course in 57.242 seconds for a top speed of
105.845 mph (170.341 k/hr) to take the inside front row starting
spot in Sunday's third of 16 2007 races.


Australian Will Power, who leads the points race after winning
the season opener at Las Vegas, will start alongside Bourdais,
who had claimed the preliminary pole by leading Friday's
qualifying session.


England's Justin Wilson and Swiss rookie Neel Jani will start in
row two with Spain's Oriol Servia and US rookie Graham Rahal in
row three.


Power has 59 points to 44 for Canada's Alex Tagliani, who will
start 11th, and 40 points for Bourdais, who won last week at Long
Beach.


Brazil's Roberto Moreno will replace US rookie Alex Figge, who is
still suffering from injuries from a mishap last week.
