Lyon were crowned French champions for a sixth successive year on
Saturday after nearest rivals Toulouse lost 3-2 at Rennes.


Gerard Houllier's men are a massive 17 points clear of second-
placed Lens, who leapfrogged Toulouse with a 2-0 victory over Le
Mans, with only 15 points available to their two main rivals.
