A Palestinian was killed in an Israeli air strike on his car in
Gaza on Saturday, minutes after two Israelis were wounded in a
Palestinian rocket attack on the Jewish state, medical sources
said.


Kamal Anan, 37, of the radical Islamic Jihad group was killed
when an Israeli aircraft fired a missile at his vehicle shortly
after he had fired a rocket at Israel, the sources said.


Another militant was lightly wounded.
