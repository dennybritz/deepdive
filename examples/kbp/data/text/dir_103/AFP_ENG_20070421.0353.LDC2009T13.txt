Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old girl during an incursion
in Jenin, bringing to five the number of Palestinians killed in
the West Bank town on Saturday, medical sources said.


Huda Barghish was shot dead as 25 army jeeps rolled into the
centre of Jenin's refugee camp, the sources said.


Earlier on Saturday, three Palestinian militants were killed when
Israeli special forces opened fire on their vehicle. A
Palestinian policeman was also killed by Israeli fire in Jenin.


A Palestinian militant of the radical Islamic Jihad movement was
also killed on Saturday when an Israeli aircraft targeted his
vehicle in the Gaza Strip shortly after he had fired a rocket
against Israel, sources on both sides said.


The deaths brought to 5,666 the overall toll since the eruption
of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the vast majority
of them Palestinians, according to an AFP count.
