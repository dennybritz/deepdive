A capsule carrying the world's fifth space tourist, US-Hungarian
Charles Simonyi, and two cosmonauts  from the International Space
Station landed back on Earth Saturday, Russia's space control
centre said.


The Soyuz capsule with Simonyi, who spent nearly two weeks aboard
the space station on a trip that cost him 25 million dollars (19
million euros), touched down as planned in the steppes of
Kazakhstan, the centre said.
