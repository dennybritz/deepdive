Disgraced former Italian champions Juventus moved a step closer
to a return to the Italian top flight on Saturday with a 3-1 win
at home to promotion rivals Genoa.


The Turin-based side now have 69 points - 23 wins, 9 draws and
two defeats - and are seven points ahead of second-placed Napoli
with Genoa a further point back in third with seven matches to
play.


The top two teams will be promoted to the Serie A, while the
third, depending on their points, can also be directly promoted
or have play-offs with the fourth, fifth and sixth-placed teams.


Czech playmaker Pavel Nedved (19) and defender Giorgio Chiellini
(38) put the hosts ahead, with veteran striker Marco Di Vaio
giving Genoa some hope just before the break.


But French defender Jonathan Zebina scored the winner after 66
minutes.


Juventus were last summer demoted from Serie A and given a nine-
point handicap in Serie B for their role in the Italian match-
fixing scandal.
