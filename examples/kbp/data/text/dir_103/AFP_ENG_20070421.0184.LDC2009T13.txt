European Union (EU) observers monitoring presidential elections
in Nigeria on Saturday criticised the organisation of the poll in
the north.


"For now the assessment is outspokenly negative ... I'm very
concerned," Max van den Berg, head of the EU observer mission,
told journalists in the northern town of Kaduna.


He said he was commenting on the process so far, as voting was
still going on, at least in most parts of the country.


Some 61.5 million Nigerians were eligible to vote Saturday to
elect a new president for four years in what should be the first
civilian-to-civilian transfer of power since independence in
1960.


Van den Berg said the mission had not seen the massive
improvement it had asked for following harshly-criticsed
governorship elections. EU observers had expressed "serious
concerns" due to organisational problems, under-age voting and a
failure to guarantee secrecy of the ballot.


In Kaduna state Saturday, where the EU mission was monitoring,
voting had still not started by early afternoon.


"No polling station has yet opened. No voting papers have been
distributed from the (electoral commission) centre to the voting
stations", Van den Berg said shortly before 2 pm (1300 GMT).


At a nationwide level, the chief observer, who is a Dutch MP,
said he was most concerned about the absence of serial numbers on
some ballot papers.


"If a group of ballot papers is not coming in a bunch of hundred
how do you want to trace it later? This doesn't sound good," he
said at a press briefing.
