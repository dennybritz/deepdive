Israeli troops shot dead two Palestinian militants during a raid
on Saturday in the West Bank town of Jenin, Palestinian security
and medical sources said.


Israeli special forces opened fire on a car, killing Mohammed al-
Dama and Ahmad Ayassa from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a militant
offshoot of president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah movement.


A third militant from the Islamic Jihad, another militant group,
was critically injured in the same incident, the sources said.


The Israeli army had no immediate reaction.
