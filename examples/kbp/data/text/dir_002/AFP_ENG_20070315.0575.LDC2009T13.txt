English Premiership club Leicester have lost one point after
fielding ineligible player Ian Humphreys in two matches in
November while he was registered for Leeds.


Humphreys was on loan to Leeds at the time and, under the
league's rules, was not eligible to play for his parent club.
Leicester have two weeks to lodge an appeal.
