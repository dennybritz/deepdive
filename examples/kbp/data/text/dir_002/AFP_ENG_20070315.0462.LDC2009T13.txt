Pakistan's bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed, a former international
leg-spinner, was taken to hospital on Thursday with a suspected
broken nose.


Mushtaq was hurt during World Cup fielding practice, a spokesman
said.


Pakistan, who lost their opening match to the West Indies here on
Tuedsay, face Ireland in their next game on Saturday.
