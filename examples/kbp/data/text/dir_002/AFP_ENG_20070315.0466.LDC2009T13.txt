South Africa look likely to rest pace bowler Makhaya Ntini for
their opening World Cup match against the Netherlands here on
Friday.


Ntini only joined the team late Wednesday after attending the
birth of his daughter back home.


"Ntini needs time to find his feet and will play the second match
against Scotland before the match against Australia," said
skipper Graeme Smith.
