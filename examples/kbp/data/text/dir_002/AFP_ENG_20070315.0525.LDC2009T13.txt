Pakistan's bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed, a former international
leg-spinner, was taken to hospital on Thursday with a suspected
broken nose.


Mushtaq was hurt during World Cup fielding practice.


"Mushtaq was hit by a throw which hurt his forehead and nose. He
is in hospital and we are waiting for X-ray reports," Pervez Mir,
the Pakistan media manager, told AFP.


Pakistan, who lost their opening match to the West Indies here on
Tuedsay, face Ireland in their next game on Saturday.
