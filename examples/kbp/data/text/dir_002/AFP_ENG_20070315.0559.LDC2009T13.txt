Around 20 journalists demonstrated in Cairo on Thursday to demand
the freedom of a Sudanese cameraman for Al-Jazeera television
being held at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay.


Sami al-Haj was arrested by the Pakistani army on the Afghan
border in December 2001 and has been held without charge since
2002.


The demonstrators, who included Al-Jazeera's Cairo bureau chief,
Hussein Abdel Ghani, carried banners demanding "freedom for Sami
el-Haj and all prisoners of conscience."
