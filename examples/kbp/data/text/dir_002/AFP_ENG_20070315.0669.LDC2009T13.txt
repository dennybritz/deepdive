The US Senate Thursday rejected a plan by the Democratic majority
to set a timetable aimed at getting US combat troops out of Iraq
by the end of March 2008.


The Senate rejected the measure formulated by the Democratic
leadership by 50 votes to 48, in the latest showdown between
Congress's Democratic leaders and Republican backers of President
George W. Bush.
