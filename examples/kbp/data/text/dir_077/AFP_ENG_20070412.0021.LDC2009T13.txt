Chinese share prices rose 0.48 percent in Thursday morning trade,
on fresh capital flows with machinery and power companies in
focus, dealers said.


They said investor sentiment was bolstered by the continued run
up in prices over the past eight trading days but warned that
profit taking was likely given the recent pace of gains.


"The market was bolstered by continued fund inflows thanks partly
to the yuan's strength, but investors seemed a bit cautious after
the key index breached 3,500 points," said Zhang Yi, an analyst
at Yibang Investment.


"I believe there will be some corrections around current index
levels because the market has risen a little too quickly and
sharply over past weeks and a consolidation is definitely
necessary," Zhang added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares, ended the morning up 16.87 points or 0.48 percent at
3,512.09, after hitting a new all- time high of 3,519.17.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 17.85 points or 0.49 percent at
3,692.22 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was up 13.13 points or
1.35 percent at 984.52, a new record.
