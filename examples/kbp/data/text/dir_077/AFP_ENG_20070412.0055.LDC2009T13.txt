Philippine President Gloria Arroyo said Thursday she may cancel
her official visit to China following her husband's heart
surgery.


Arroyo told reporters she was reviewing whether to go ahead with
the visit, but gave no further details.


"I'm still consulting with the DFA (Department of Foreign
Affairs)," she said when asked if she was planning to cancel her
trip, scheduled from April 20-25.


Cabinet members have said the president's trip to China would
depend on her husband's recovery.


Arroyo briefly left the hospital on Thursday where her husband,
Jose Miguel Arroyo, 60, is confined for a meeting at the
presidential palace, but returned a few hours later to stay at
his bedside.


This was the first time the 60-year-old leader had left the
hospital since her husband underwent a 10-hour emergency heart
operation to repair a leak in the main artery and a triple-bypass
of another artery.


Reporters who saw her leave through a side entrance said the
president appeared tired.


Since her husband was admitted on Monday night, Arroyo has been
working from a makeshift office set up in the hospital.


Doctors there have said her husband has been recovering faster
than expected and gave him a 75-80 percent chance of pulling
through.
