Almost half of Israelis support releasing Palestinian prisoners
implicated in attacks that killed Israelis in exchange for a
soldier seized by Palestinian militants, a poll said on Thursday.


Forty-five percent favour such a swap while 36.5 percent are
opposed, according to a poll in the Maariv newspaper.


The survey was published less than a week after the Palestinians
passed to Israel through Egyptian mediators a list of prisoners
they want freed in exchange for Gilad Shalit, a soldier seized by
Gaza militants last June.


The list reportedly contains names of Palestinians "with blood on
their hands" -- those involved in attacks that have killed
Israelis. Israel has said it would not release such detainees.


Israel expressed "disappointment and reservations" over the list
after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's first meeting with security
chiefs to discuss the names earlier this week.


Olmert will convene the security cabinet on Sunday to set
Israel's criteria for clearing prisoners for release.


Maariv did not provide a sample size or margin of error for the
poll.
