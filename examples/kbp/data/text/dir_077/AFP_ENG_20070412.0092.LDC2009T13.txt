The BBC's director general said Thursday he had been reassured by
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas that missing reporter Alan
Johnston is "alive and well," a month after he disappeared.


Mark Thompson, who travelled to Gaza for a day of action to press
for Johnston's release, said he had talks with Abbas Wednesday
evening.


"He had credible information that Alan is alive and well, which
is encouraging," he told BBC Radio Four's flagship Today
programme.


"He also gave me a personal assurance that he and the Palestinian
authorities are doing everything in their power to secure Alan's
release and regard it as a very high priority indeed," he added.


Johnston, a Scotsman who has been the BBC's main correspondent in
Gaza for three years, was forced from his car at gunpoint as he
drove home from work on March 12 in Gaza City.


His parents were due to give a press conference in London later
Thursday as part of action a month after his disappearance, the
longest a foreign journalist has been held in the Palestinian
territories.


Thompson underlined the importance of reporting by media like the
BBC of the situation in Gaza.


"What is completely clear is that the Palestinian authorities
understand that it's absolutely in the interests of the people of
Gaza that Alan should be released (as soon) as possible.


"Without correspondents like Alan Johnston reporting what is
going on in Gaza, it's very hard to see how the story of Gaza can
be told around the world," he said.
