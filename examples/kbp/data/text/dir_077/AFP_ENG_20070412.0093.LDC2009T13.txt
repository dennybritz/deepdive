China's foreign exchange reserves, already the world's largest,
surpassed 1.2 trillion dollars at the end of March, the central
bank said Thursday.


The reserves were up 12.7 percent from the beginning of the year,
and 37.4 percent from 12 months earlier, the People's Bank of
China said in a statement on its website.


The trade surplus, one main source of the bulging reserves, stood
at 46.6 billion dollars in the first three months, while foreign
direct investment, the other source, reached 15.9 billion
dollars, data released earlier showed.
