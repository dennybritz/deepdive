The food poisoning of 203 hospital patients in northeast China
was an intentional act, police said Thursday, while announcing a
criminal investigation into the case that left one dead.


"The mass poisoning incident on April 9 at the Heilongjiang
Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital was a criminal act involving
the intentional use of dangerous substances," the provincial
government said on its website.


Police were seeking a person or persons who placed rat poison in
a kettle of water that was used to make rice porridge for the
patients' Monday morning breakfast, it said.


A 77-year-old woman died from the poisoning. She had been
admitted to the hospital on Friday last week after suffering from
heart problems.


The other victims, including 135 patients, 62 people staying with
the patients and five doctors and nurses, were in stable
condition after suffering nausea and diarrhoea.


The hospital where the incident occurred was among the largest
and best-equipped medical institutions in the provincial capital
of Harbin, press reports said.


The use of rat poison is often cited in criminal poisoning cases
in China and is also frequently used to commit suicide.


Reports of food poisoning outbreaks emerge frequently in China,
where hygiene and safety standards remain low for many of the
nation's 1.3 billion people.


In September last year, nearly 100 children in southwest China's
Sichuan province fell ill after eating porridge and steamed bread
at a primary school.


The same month 336 people fell sick in Shanghai after eating pork
contaminated with anabolic steroids.
