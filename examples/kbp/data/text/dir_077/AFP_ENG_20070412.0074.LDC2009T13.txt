The European Trade Union Confederation (EUTC) urged the European
Central Bank on Thursday not to interfere in wage talks,
rejecting the ECB's argument that high wage increases could fuel
inflation in the single currency area.


"The ECB should stop meddling in wage talks," the EUTC's deputy
general secretary, Reiner Hoffmann, told the daily Frankfurter
Rundschau in an interview.


Wage policy did not represent any inflationary threat in Europe,
he insisted.


"Company profits have risen meteorically, but not workers'
income," Hoffmann said.


And in Germany in particular, "there is a lot of catching up to
do" for workers to participate in the economic upturn, he added.


The ECB, known as the guardian of the euro, has repeatedly urged
for wage deals across Europe to remain moderate so as not to
trigger an inflationary spiral in the 13 countries that share the
euro.


The euro bank was scheduled to meet later on Thursday to set
interest rates for the eurozone. It has raised borrowing costs
seven times since December 2005. And while no change in rates was
expected this week, the ECB is widely expected to raise them
again in the coming months from their current five-and-a-half-
year high of 3.75 percent.


Employers, too, have warned against a further tightening of
monetary conditions in the euro area.
