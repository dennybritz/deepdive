Kurt Vonnegut, the creator of wry science fiction and black
comedy built on his experience as a World War II prisoner of war
who survived the horrific Dresden bombing, died late Tuesday, the
New York Times reported.


Vonnegut was the author of "Slaughterhouse-Five," widely rated as
one of the finest American novels of the 20th century, "Cat's
Cradle," and "Breakfast of Champions."


He died at 84 in New York City after suffering brain injuries in
a fall several weeks ago, according to his longtime friend Morgan
Entrekin, the Times reported on its website Wednesday.


Born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1922, Vonnegut was captured
inside German lines in 1945 following the Battle of the Bulge.


Confined to an underground meatpacking cellar in Dresden when
Allied bombers descended upon the city, he was one of just seven
US prisoners who survived the devastating firestorm that engulfed
the city.


That experience formed the core of "Slaughterhouse Five,"
published in the midst of the furor over the Vietnam war in 1969
to widespread acclaim.


"All this happened, more or less," is the memorable line opening
the metaphysical, humanist tale of a soldier "unstuck in time" in
an underground Dresden abattoir.
