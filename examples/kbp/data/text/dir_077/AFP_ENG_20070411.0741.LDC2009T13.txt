Felix Hernandez outdueled Daisuke Matsuzaka and made a bid to
become the second- youngest in major league history to toss a no-
hitter in the Seattle Mariners' 3-0 win over the Boston Red Sox
Wednesday.


The Red Sox pounded the Mariners, 14-3, in the Fenway Park home
opener Tuesday, but 36,360 fans - the second-largest crowd in
modern Fenway history - packed the ballpark one night later to
watch who general manager Theo Epstein called a "national
treasure."


The 26-year-old Japanese righthander signed this winter after a
lengthy process that cost the Red Sox organization more than 100
million dollars.


Matsuzaka pitched well, allowing three runs and eight hits in
seven innings. He walked one and struck out four and shut down
coutryman Ichiro Suzuki, who went hitless in the historical
matchup between the two Japanese stars.


Hernandez, who turned 21 three days ago, lost his no-hit bid when
J.D. Drew led off the eighth inning with a first-pitch single to
centre field.


That ended the Venezuelan's bid to become the youngest Major
League Baseball pitcher to toss a no-hitter since Amos Rusie on
July 31, 1891, for the New York Giants against the Brooklyn
Grooms.


Hernandez finished the one-hitter, walking two and striking out
six, to run his streak of scoreless innings this season to 17.
