Fiji's coup leader Voreqe Bainimarama on Thursday accused the
country's powerful indigenous chiefs of ignoring the country's
interests by rejecting his nomination for vice president.


The decision of the influential Great Council of Chiefs Wednesday
reopened splits caused by the military's overthrow of the elected
government of prime minister Laisenia Qarase in December.


The chiefs rejected the government's nomination of Ratu Epeli
Nailatikau, who is currently foreign minister, reportedly because
they considered him part of an illegal regime.


"I expected the chiefs to be visionary and consider the bigger
picture," Bainimarama said in a statement.


"We need to rise above our narrow personal agendas and make
decisions for the greater good of the country as a whole," he
said.


He said the chiefs' council, which under the constitution has the
power to appoint the president and vice-president, had failed to
consider the nomination objectively.


"Indeed, instead of pulling together in this hour of need, they
have drifted apart, primarily based on prejudiced advice and
personal agendas," the military chief and self-appointed prime
minister said.


Bainimarama has been trying to project an image of unity in Fiji
since the overthrow of Qarase's nationalist government, which had
won elections in May. The council had backed Qarase in his
conflict with the government in the months leading up to the
coup.


Bainimarama had accused Qarase's government of corruption and
racism against the country's ethnic Indian minority.
