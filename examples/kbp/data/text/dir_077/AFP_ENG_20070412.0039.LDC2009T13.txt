Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej has pardoned a Swiss man who
was sentenced to 10 years in prison last month for vandalising
portraits of the monarch, prosecutors said Thursday.


"I have learned that he received a royal pardon a few days ago.
Now he has been released but will be deported from Thailand,"
said Panu Kwanyuen, the provincial attorney general in the
northern city of Chiang Mai.


Oliver Jufer, 57, had been sentenced to 10 years in prison on
March 29 after pleading guilty to five counts of lese majeste --
the crime of offending the dignity of a sovereign.


He was convicted of defacing several portraits of the king with
spray paint during a drunken spree in Chiang Mai in December.
