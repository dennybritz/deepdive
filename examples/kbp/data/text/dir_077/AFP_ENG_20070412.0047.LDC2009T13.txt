Kim Mi-hyun will be looking to snap another victory drought as
she seeks to defend her title at this week's LPGA Ginn Open.


The South Korean is taking on a 144-player field at the 2.6
million dollar event which she won last year by two strokes for
her sixth career USLPGA crown.


Kim has had just four top ten finishes and no wins in her last 18
tournaments. Last year's victory at this event was her first in
four years.


In 2006, Mexico's Lorena Ochoa and Australian Karrie Webb
finished just back of Kim who entered the final round with a
three-stroke lead.


Morgan Pressel fresh off her first career win at the Kraft
Nabisco Championship two weeks ago is one of Kim's main
challengers.


World number one Annika Sorenstam is looking to regain her form
after struggling at the first major of the season where she tied
for 30th.


Ochoa has four top-10 finishes in five events played this season
and Suzann Pettersen has been on a roll of late. Pettersen will
be trying to erase memories of her shocking collapse in the final
round of the first major of the season.


She also posted a runner-up finish at the Safeway International
earlier this year.


Paula Creamer, Stacy Prammanasudh and Meaghan Francella, all
winners in 2007, will also be in the field.
