Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. said Thursday that a foreign director
will join its board for the first time, reflecting the growing
global reach of the world's second-largest automaker.


Toyota named American Jim Press, the president of its North
America subsidiary, as a senior managing director along with
eight new Japanese directors who will also join the board subject
to shareholder approval.


Toyota, which is on track to soon surpass General Motors as the
world's top automaker, has been expanding its operations in the
United States to try to avert potential trade friction with
Washington.


Toyota has been trying hard to avert a political backlash of the
type seen in the 1980s when Japanese automakers first made major
inroads in the US.
