Rapper Snoop Dogg escaped a jail term after appearing at a
California court on Wednesday and pleading no contest to two
charges of illegally possessing a gun and marijuana.


The 35-year-old musician -- real name Calvin Broadus -- was given
a three-year suspended sentence and handed five years of
probation by the court in Pasadena, northeast of Los Angeles.


He was also ordered to perform 800 hours of community service.


The charges related to an incident last October at Burbank's Bob
Hope airport when police discovered marijuana in the rapper's car
while confronting him over a parking violation.


The gun charge was added later after the weapon was discovered at
the rapper's home by police, authorities said.


Broadus was convicted of felony drug charges in 1990, making it
illegal to own a firearm.   Prosecutors said before the hearing
Broadus could have been jailed for up to four years in state
prison.


The case is part of myriad legal woes facing the rapper, who has
separate outstanding cases in other parts of California.


He pleaded not guilty to possession of a deadly weapon in January
after an outlawed collapsible police baton was found in his
luggage as he attempted to catch a flight to San Francisco in
September last year.


He was also arrested in Los Angeles on November 28 for weapon and
drugs possession offenses.


Last month Broadus was arrested in Sweden for suspected drug use.
The rapper has had several brushes with the law since being tried
and acquitted for murder in 1993, the year he found fame with his
debut album "Doggystyle."
