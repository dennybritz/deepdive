The US state of Texas on Wednesday executed by lethal injection a
38-year-old man who may have been mentally retarded for the 1993
rape and murder of a 17 -year-old girl.


James Clark was pronounced dead at 6:17 pm (2317 GMT), seven
minutes after the lethal dose was injected at the prison in
Huntsville, southern Texas, according to prison documents.


Before being put to death, Clark appeared not to understand what
was happening. Asked if wanted to make a last statement, he
laughed and said: "Um, I don't know what to say. I don't know."


Noticing his father-in-law who had come to witness the execution,
he then said: "I didn't know anybody was there. Howdy." He tried
to say more but was unable as the drugs started to take effect.


Anti-capital punishment advocates attempted to have his execution
blocked on the grounds he was mentally retarded.


Execution is generally prohibited in the United States for those
with an IQ of less than 70.


Different test results cited during the appeals process on
Clark's case had recorded his intelligence quotient (IQ) as
between 65 and 74.


Clark was sentenced to death for raping and shooting dead 17
-year-old Cari Crews in Denton, Texas in June 1993.


He was the 13th person to be executed so far this year in the
United States.
