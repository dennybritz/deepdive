Two soldiers were killed during a clash with Muslim militants in
the southern Philippines, the military said Thursday.


The deaths occurred Wednesday on the island of Jolo during a
firefight with Abu Sayyaf militants, Lieutenant Colonel Bartolome
Bacarro said.


The clash came days after two Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) bomb-makers
being sheltered by the Abu Sayyaf escaped a military raid on
their base on Monday.


The two JI members, Indonesians Dulmatin and Umar Patek,
allegedly involved in the deadly 2002 Bali bombings, have been
hiding with the Al-Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf in Jolo since late
last year and have been the target of a massive military
operation.


The US government has an 11 million dollar bounty for their
capture.


More than 8,000 Filipino troops are on Jolo on instructions from
President Gloria Arroyo to crush the Abu Sayyaf, a small group of
self-styled Islamic militants.


The group has been blamed for a series of bomb attacks in the
Philippines in recent years, as well as high-profile kidnappings
of foreigners and missionaries.


Since the military operation began last September the group's two
top leaders have been killed and the remaining members, said to
number around 400, have splintered into smaller units trying to
evade government forces.
