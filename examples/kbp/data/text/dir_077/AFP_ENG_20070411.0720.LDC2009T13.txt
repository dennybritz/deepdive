Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao called Thursday for Japan and China to
find a peaceful settlement to a bitter dispute over gas fields in
the East China Sea.


In an address to the Japanese parliament, Wen called for the
Asian powers to "cooperate in a positive way" on the gas dispute.


"We will try to make the sea a sea of peace, cooperation and
friendship," Wen said.


Japan and China are two of the world's largest energy importers
and have long jostled over rights to the lucrative gas fields in
disputed waters.


The two sides failed to find a resolution to the long-running
dispute in time for Wen's visit, as had been hoped by Japanese
officials.
