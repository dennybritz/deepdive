India's defence ministry Thursday declared successful a test of a
homegrown intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of
reaching the Chinese cities of Beijing and Shanghai.


Calling it a "major milestone in missile technology," the
ministry said in its statement, "The 16-metre-long (52-feet)
missile weighing 48 tonnes lifted off successfully from its rail
mobile launcher system.


"The entire flight path of approximately 15 minutes duration
validated all mission objectives."


The ministry gave the range of the missile tested Thursday as
more than 3000 kilometres (1,860 miles) and said it was capable
of carrying a nuclear or conventional payload of 1.5 tonnes.


The launch of the Agni-III missile took place from Wheeler
Island, 180 kilometres (110 miles) northeast of Bhubaneswar, the
capital of eastern Orissa state.


The test Thursday was the second test of the Agni-III, a two-
stage solid-fuelled missile which has a diameter of 1.8 metres
(six feet) and can carry nuclear or conventional warheads.


The first test ended in failure last July, when it crashed into
the sea without hitting a designated target.


"With this success, the design team is happy that the problems
faced in the previous attempt on July 9 last year have been fully
understood and solved," the ministry said.
