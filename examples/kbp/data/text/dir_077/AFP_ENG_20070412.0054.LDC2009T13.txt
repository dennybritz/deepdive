Chauncey Billups collected 28 points and eight assists as Detroit
clinched their second straight Eastern Conference title with a
104-99 win over Orlando on Wednesday.


Detroit (51-27) also wrapped up home-court advantage throughout
the entire Eastern playoffs.


However, the Pistons were the top seed last season but fell in
six games in the conference finals to the Miami Heat, who went on
to capture the National Basketball Association title.


"With the players Joe (Dumars) brought here and what we've done
since we've been here, this is pretty much what we came to play
for," Pistons coach Flip Saunders said.


Wednesday's win also helped the Pistons clinch their fifth
Central Division crown in six years and completed their first
season-series sweep over the Magic (36-42) since the 1991-92
campaign.


With the loss, Orlando's lead for the eighth and final spot in
the East was trimmed to just one game over the Indiana Pacers
(35-43). Indiana beat Milwaukee earlier Wednesday.


The Pistons and Magic would meet in the first round of the
postseason if Orlando can hold off the Pacers.  These two clubs
met in the opening round of the postseason during the 2002-03
season, when Detroit battled from a 3-1 deficit to win the
series.


Orlando trailed by as many as 18 points before making things
interesting when Nelson, who netted 10 straight points at one
stage in the fourth quarter, fed former Piston Grant Hill for a
jumper to tie the game at 95-95 at the 1:35 mark.
