England opening batsman Marcus Trescothick said on Wednesday he
is desperate to play again for the national team which will come
as welcome news for a squad currently struggling at the World
Cup.


The 31-year-old left-hander, who quit the winter Ashes tour in
Australia because of a stress-related illness, showed he is on
the way to a return to form by making 256 off just 117 balls in a
pre-season friendly for Somerset against Devon on Sunday.


"I am desperate to play for England again," Trescothick told
Somerset's official website.


"But it wouldn't be fair to anyone if I attempted to do so again
without being doubly certain that I could complete an overseas
tour, as well take part in games over here.


"I am sure I will reach a stage when I am fully recovered, but I
will not put pressure on myself by predicting when that will be.


"I believe I will play for England again, but only when the time
is right for all concerned."


Trescothick was sorely missed in Australia where Ricky Ponting's
men regained the Ashes with a 5-0 whitewash.


"I wouldn't have gone to Australia if I hadn't felt convinced in
my own mind that I could handle an Ashes series there," he added.
"Now I know that feeling was wrong.


"While viewing the Ashes matches I really wished I could be out
there helping the team, but knew deep down that I needed to be at
home."


Trescothick has been missed in the Caribbean where the top order
has found runs hard to come bay.


"With the World Cup it has been different in that I just wish I
was there full stop, which in itself demonstrates progress," said
Trescothick.
