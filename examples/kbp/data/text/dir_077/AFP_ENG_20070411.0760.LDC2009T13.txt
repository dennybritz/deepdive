A suicide bomber blew himself up in a truck on a bridge spanning
the Tigris River in northern Baghdad on Thursday, killing five
people and partially destroying the bridge, a security official
said.


The attack happened during the morning rush hour on the Al-
Sarafiyah Bridge which connects the Shiite Al-Atafiyah on the
western bank of the Tigris, to the Sunni neighbourhood of
Waziriyah on the eastern bank.
