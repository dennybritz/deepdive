India's space agency is to launch an Italian satellite by a home-
built rocket this month, its first foreign commercial contract
from an overseas customer, a spokesman said Thursday.


"April 23rd is the tentative date of the launch," said S.
Krishnamurthy, spokesman for the Bangalore-based Indian Space
Research Organisation, or ISRO.


Preparations are under way for the launch of the Agile satellite
from the Sriharikota space station in southern India,
Krishnamurthy said.


The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, or PSLV, the workhorse of the
Indian space programme, will blast off with the 360-kilogramme
Agile on a mission for the Italian Institute of Astrophysics and
the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics.


It's the first time ISRO is launching a foreign satellite as the
main payload on commercial terms, said Krishnamurthy, who didn't
disclose how much the space agency would receive as payment.


The PSLV, capable of carrying 1,000-kilogramme payloads, has
previously put in space small, experimental and so-called
piggyback satellites for customers including from South Korea,
Germany and Belgium.


"The PSLV has proved its reliability and versatility with many
successes," the ISRO spokesman said. "If this launch too is a
success, it will be a good beginning.


"We expect more and more people to show interest in using our
launch capability," he added.


India, which started its space programme in 1962, developed the
PSLV, which has carried out six consecutive successful missions
since 1999, to reduce dependence on foreign space agencies.
