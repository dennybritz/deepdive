Lufthansa flights from Berlin were cancelled or delayed on
Thursday morning as 40 of the German flag carrier's cabin staff
staged warning strikes, the giant services sector union Ver.di
said.


Seven flights from the German capital were cancelled and others
suffered delays of up to three hours as staff walked out in
protest at Lufthansa's refusal to pay a 3.4-percent wage increase
awarded to ground staff to cabin staff as well, a spokesman for
Ver.di said.


Similar warning strikes could be staged again in the next few
days, he said.
