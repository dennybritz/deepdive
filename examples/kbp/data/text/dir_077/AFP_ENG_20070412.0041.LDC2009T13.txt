Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov will hold talks Thursday
with his Pakistani counterpart Shaukat Aziz on promoting trade
and economic relations between the two countries, officials said.


Fradkov, who is the first Russian prime minister to visit
Pakistan, flew into Islamabad late Wednesday on a three-day trip.
His visit follows President Pervez Musharraf's trip to Russia in
February 2003.


Officials said the two prime ministers would hold "in-depth
discussions" on bilateral relations and efforts to enhance trade
and economic ties.


"The emphasis during the visit would be on establishing a
substantive economic agenda to the mutual benefit of both
countries," a foreign ministry statement said.


Fradkov will also call on Musharraf and is scheduled to meet with
business leaders in Pakistan.


The two countries are expected to sign agreements to increase
cooperation in railways, narcotics control and exchanges in
cultural, educational, sports and scientific fields, the foreign
ministry said.


Bilateral trade presently stands at 520 million dollars, which is
heavily in favour of Russia. The foreign ministry however said
"good prospects exist" for collaboration between Pakistan and
Russia in oil and gas, construction of coal, thermal and hydro
electric power generation units.


"The two countries are committed to establishing a strong
relationship based on solid foundations," it said.
