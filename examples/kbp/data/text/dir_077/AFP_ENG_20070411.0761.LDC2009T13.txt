A suicide bomber blew himself up in a truck on a bridge spanning
the Tigris River in northern Baghdad on Thursday, killing five
people and partially destroying the bridge, a security official
said.


The attack happened during the morning rush hour on the Al-
Sarafiyah Bridge which connects the Shiite Al-Atafiyah
neighbourhood on the western bank of the Tigris, to the Sunni
neighbourhood of Waziriyah on the eastern bank.


Five people were killed and 20 wounded in the explosion, the
force of which saw the bridge partially collapse, said the
security official.


Several people fell into the river in their cars following the
blast, the official added.


The riverside in central Baghdad was filled with dust and haze,
with vision totally obscured to the north after the attack.


The Al-Sarafiyah Bridge is one of the oldest and highest in the
capital.
