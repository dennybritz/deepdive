Industrial output in India rose 11 percent in February as
production of cars, steel and cement increased to meet demand in
the booming economy, official figures showed Thursday.


The output level for industrial goods, which make up a quarter of
the economy, gained 8.8 percent in the same month a year ago.


Analysts say strong industrial output has kept India on track to
meet a government target of 9.2 percent economic growth for the
fiscal year ending March, the fastest rate in nearly two decades.
