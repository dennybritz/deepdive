Around 8,000 Deutsche Telekom employees were expected to strike
Thursday in protest at the telecommunication giant's plans to
transfer 50,000 staff into legally separate service companies
with less favourable working conditions.


The giant services sector union Ver.di said that about 8,000
workers around the country were expected to stage warning strikes
as employee representatives and management met for a third round
of talks on Deutsche Telekom's cost-cutting plans.


Around 1,000 Deutsche Telekom employees had already staged
temporary walk-outs at six sites on Wednesday. And the protests
were scheduled to extended on Thursday, Ver.di said.


"There is a great deal of anger and indignation," said Ver.di
chief negotiator Lothar Schroeder.


"Workers fear that they are being made to the foot the bill for
years of mismanagement," he said.


Talks were scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday.
