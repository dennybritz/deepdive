Five time all-star Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics will miss
the remainder of the season with a sore left elbow.


Pierce, who underwent surgery on the same elbow last offseason
and had an infection in it earlier this season, has not played
since re-aggravating the injury in a 105-96 double-overtime
victory over Orlando on March 28.


Pierce missed 24 games earlier this season with a stress reaction
in his left foot, Pierce averaged 25 points and 5.9 rebounds in a
career-low 47 games.


Pierce, who has missed the last six games for Boston prior to
Wednesday's contest against Philadelphia, has averaged 23.6
points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 1.7 steals over his nine-
year National Basketball Assocation career.
