Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said Thursday a limited number
of Japanese leaders were to blame for World War II era
atrocities, and that most Japanese people had been victims of the
war.


Relations between the Asian powers have long been marred by
disputes over Japan's invasion and occupation of China.


"Japan's invasion caused a huge number of casualties among the
Chinese people, and the scars of the Chinese are grave," Wen said
in an address to the Japanese parliament.


"But the war also caused suffering among the Japanese general
public," he said.


"The responsibility for the war is attributable to a limited
number of militarist leaders at the time, and the Japanese
general public are also victims of the war," he said.
