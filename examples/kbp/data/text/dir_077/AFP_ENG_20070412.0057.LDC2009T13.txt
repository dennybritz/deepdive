Kyrgyzstan's parliament met in emergency session Thursday to seek
an end to the Central Asian country's political turmoil as
opposition demonstrators gathered for a second day in central
Bishkek.


On the capital's main square about 1,000 protestors, many wearing
the blue scarves of the opposition United Front for a Decent
Future for Kyrgzystan, ate free breakfasts provided by organisers
and cleaned the square after Wednesday's rally of about 10,000.


In parliament, party leaders broke off their holiday to discuss
ways out of the standoff.


The opposition wants constitutional changes to bring the country
under parliamentary rule, while President Kurmanbek Bakiyev has
proposed only milder curbs on his power.


Bakiyev has struggled to contain opposition in parliament and on
the streets since he came to power in 2005 after a violent
uprising that drove out former veteran president Aksar Akayev.


Turmoil has ratched up since the end of last year in the
mountainous Central Asian state, strategically located near
Afghanistan and host to US and Russian air bases.


Organisers vowed a bigger rally Thursday and said they would
maintain protests until Bakiyev agreed to early presidential
elections.
