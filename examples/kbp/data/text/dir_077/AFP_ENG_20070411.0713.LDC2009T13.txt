Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Thursday became the first Chinese
leader to address the Japanese parliament in more than two
decades, saying he hoped his trip would bring in a new era of
warmer relations.


"If (Japanese) Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe's visit to China in
October was a trip to break the ice, I want my visit to be an
ice-melting visit," he said.
