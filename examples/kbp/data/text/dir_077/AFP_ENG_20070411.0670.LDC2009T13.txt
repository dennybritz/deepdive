US President George W. Bush on Wednesday extended permission for
the Palestinian Liberation Organization to keep a Washington
office for another six months, the White House said.


Bush announced in a memorandum for US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice that he was waiving restrictions on the PLO
maintaining offices and spending money in the United States. The
White House released the memo.


The United States has routinely done so every six months for the
PLO office to operate since 1994.


A White House official said that the goal of advancing Middle
East peace required that "the United States should maintain its
ties and contacts with all sides committed to peace."


PLO offices in Washington are "a useful channel of communication"
to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.


"Had the president not issued the waiver, the PLO office in
Washington would be barred from operation and US banks would be
required to bar access to PLO funds," said the White House
official.
