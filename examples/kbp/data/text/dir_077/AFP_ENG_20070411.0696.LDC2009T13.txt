Hall of Famer Hank Aaron says he would prefer to be golfing and
not commemorating Barry Bonds if the San Francisco Giant slugger
goes ahead and breaks his all-time home-run record.


"I'm not going to be around. I'd probably fly to West Palm Beach
to play golf," Aaron told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
"Again it has nothing to do with anybody other than I had enough
of it.


"I don't want to be around that sort of thing anymore."


Aaron hit 755 career home runs -- 20 more than Bonds' current
total.


The Giants travel to Atlanta on August 14 for a three-game series
and even if Bonds is close to the record, Aaron said he won't go.


"It is going to be a no win situation for me anyhow," Aaron said.
"If I go, people are going to say 'Well, he went because of
this.' If I don't go, they'll say whatever. I'll just let them
make their own mind up."
