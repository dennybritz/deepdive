The former chairman of English Championship strugglers Luton on
Wednesday admitted making irregular payments to agents on three
seperate occasions.


But Bill Tomlins, who has resigned from the club which is
expecting imminent major investment, insisted in an interview
with the BBC that he made no personal gain from the transactions.


And he said he had contacted the Football Association to make
them aware of the situation.


The FA are now holding an inquiry into the matter.


Tomlins - who sacked club manager Mike Newell recently as the
side's fortunes slumped - told the BBC that the irregular
payments were made through the club's holding company J10.


Concerning his resignation he said: "There has been too much
disruption surrounding the club in recent months. I feel it is
appropriate for me to stand down at this time."


A club statement confirmed: "Earlier this year Mr Tomlins
approached the FA requesting a meeting to clarify certain matters
relating to the football club.


"Following this meeting the FA is currently carrying out an
inquiry.


"As the matter is now with the Football Association there will be
no further comment by the club until the inquiry has been
completed."


Newell himself had raised the spectre of English football
managers taking bungs in a BBC documentary earlier this season
and also heavily criticised Tomlins over where money for several
Luton players had gone to as he wanted it for buying new ones.
