The US Senate voted Wednesday to lift President George W. Bush's
restrictions on embryonic stem cell research despite a sure veto
from the White House.


The bill, which would lift a restriction on using federal funds
for stem-cell research on human embryos, passed the upper chamber
with 63 votes in favor and 34 against.
