Foreign direct investment into China in the first quarter of the
year totalled 15.9 billion dollars, a rise of 11.6 percent from
the same period a year earlier, the government said Thursday.


Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands -- where many Chinese
companies register for tax purposes -- and Japan were the top
three sources of foreign direct investment, the commerce ministry
said.


Last year actual foreign investment in China was 69.5 billion
dollars, down 4.1 percent from 2005.


If the financial sector were to be excluded, the figure totalled
63 billion dollars, a rise of 4.5 percent.
