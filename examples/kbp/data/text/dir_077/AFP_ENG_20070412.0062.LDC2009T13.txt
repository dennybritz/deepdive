The Indian government has decided to drop intrusive questions
relating to the menstrual history of female bureaucrats in a new
service review form after it caused a furore, a report said
Thursday.


"A decision to this effect has been taken considering the
sensitivity of the issue," an unnamed senior official of the
Ministry of Personnel told The Times of India.


"A fresh notification deleting those female-specific clauses will
be issued shortly," the official said.


The performance appraisal form introduced in March has a three-
page health section that asks women for a "detailed menstrual
history," information on their "last confinement," and about
their pap smears and mammograms, according to a copy of the
questionnaire seen by AFP.


The form raised the hackles of female bureaucrats who said the
questions had no bearing on their work.


Once the intrusive questions are deleted, men and women
bureaucrats will record similar details concerning routine health
check-ups comprising blood reports, liver and kidney tests and
cardiac profile, The Times reported.
