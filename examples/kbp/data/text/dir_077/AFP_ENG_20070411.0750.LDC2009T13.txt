Visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Thursday that Beijing
would never tolerate Taiwan's independence and asked Japan to
exercise caution on the issue.


"The Taiwan issue affects China's core interests," Wen said in an
address to the Japanese parliament, the first by a Chinese leader
in more than 20 years.


"We will continue to do our utmost to resolve the Taiwan issue
peacefully. We will never tolerate Taiwan independence," he said.


Wen sounded a warning to Japan, which recognises only Beijing as
China's legitimate government but where some prominent lawmakers
are known for sympathy to Taiwan.


"We will squarely protest any move to legal independence by
Taiwan's authorities and separatist movements," Wen said.


"I ask Japan to deal cautiously with this issue," he said.


China's nationalists fled to Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, in
1949 after losing the civil war to Mao Zedong's communists.


Beijing considers Taiwan part of its territory and has repeatedly
threatened to invade the island should it declare formal
independence.


Tensions between Taiwan and China have escalated since
independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian was elected
president in 2000. He was narrowly re- elected in 2004.


Wen is on the first visit by a Chinese leader to Japan in seven
years as the Asian powers work to repair relations strained in
large part due to history- related issues.
