Philippine brewer San Miguel Corp Thursday reported a 17 percent
rise in 2006 net profit to 10.6 billion pesos (220.83 million
dollars) on improved offshore sales.


Consolidated net sales grew 10 percent to 250 billion pesos
despite an easing in the last quarter of 2006 due to successive
typhoons, the company said. Consolidated operating income grew 18
percent to 20.6 billion pesos.


Domestic beer sales contributed 9.52 billion pesos in operating
income, up 15 percent from 2005 largely due to "prudent
management of manufacturing costs," while revenues reached 39.9
billion pesos.


In the international beer operations, 2006 volumes rose eight
percent with sales amounting to 299.2 million dollars, up five
percent higher on 2005.


The performance was achieved on the back of strong volumes from
operations in greater China and in the export business, San
Miguel said.


The 115-year-old San Miguel has breweries in China, Vietnam,
Indonesia, Australia and Thailand and packaging plants in China,
Vietnam and Malaysia.


San Miguel A and B shares closed steady at 65 and 73.50 pesos,
respectively, before the company released the earnings results.
