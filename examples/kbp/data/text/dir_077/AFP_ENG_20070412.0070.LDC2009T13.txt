Swiss food giant Nestle is buying the Gerber baby food business
off pharmaceuticals major Novartis for 5.5 billion dollars in
cash, Novartis announced Thursday in a communique.


"This completes Novartis' divestiture program following its
strategy to focus on healthcare with pharmaceuticals at the
core," the company said, adding that the transaction was expected
to be completed by the second half of 2007.


"Over the past decade we have continuously invested in R&D,
strengthening our innovation power and building our healthcare
businesses, particularly pharmaceuticals, while divesting over 50
percent of our non-core, non-healthcare businesses," Novartis
chairman and CEO Daniel Vasella said.


He emphasised that the transaction was also "the right move for
Gerber, as it will become a priority business in a leading global
nutrition company."


Nestle has reportedly been keen to acquire Gerber for more than
10 years. It made an offer for the group back in 1994, but was
thwarted by Sandoz, which went on to merge with Ciba-Geigy, which
gave birth to Novartis.


Gerber, based in Parsipanny, New Jersey in the United States, has
a portfolio of around 300 food products for babies, toddlers and
infants as well as a line in baby-care and life insurance.


In 2006 Gerber had unaudited net sales of 1.6 billion dollars
with an operating income of 307 million, the statement said.
