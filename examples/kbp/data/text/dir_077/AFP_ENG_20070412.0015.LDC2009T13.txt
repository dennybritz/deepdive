A Sri Lankan Airlines jet headed for London turned around and
made an emergency landing at the country's only international
airport Thursday following a "technical problem," officials said.


The Airbus A-340 carrying 250 passengers and 15 crew returned to
base three hours after take-off from the Bandaranaike
International Airport north of Colombo, airport officials said.


"The aircraft returned to base because of some vibrations and the
pilots wanted to go back and check," said one official.


The flight has been rescheduled for departure later Thursday.
