Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Thursday called on Japanese
investors to have more confidence, saying that Beijing was
working to sustain soaring growth rates.


China is Japan's top trading partner, but the growing commerce
has not been without criticism by some Japanese business leaders
that the massive investment at the expense of other countries was
risky.


"I would like Japanese investors to have more confidence," Wen,
on a fence- mending visit to Tokyo, told a luncheon hosted by the
Japan Business Federation.


"The fundamentals are in order," Wen said of China's economy,
"based on the stability of the country and society, laws, and the
establishment of a fair market where competition is possible."


Wen said he was confident that China could sustain annual growth
rates of 9.5 percent over the long term.


"When I am asked whether China can maintain this over the long
term, I answer that it is possible ... by establishing correct
policies and measures for emergency situations," he said.


Wen, the first Chinese leader to visit Japan in seven years,
asked Japanese companies to supply Chinese businesses with
technological knowhow in areas including energy and environmental
protection.


"Both Japan and China should expand into new fields of
cooperation and raise the level of both countries' economic and
trade partnership," he said.


"Japan and China should cherish our relations. Let's all cherish
them, as friendly relations and cooperation are in both peoples'
benefit," he said.
