Japanese share prices closed down 0.73 percent on Thursday,
following Wall Street lower on worries about interest rates and
slowing economic growth in the United States, dealers said.


They said that US stocks had fallen overnight after minutes from
the Federal Reserve's recent meeting indicated that the central
bank was not ruling out an interest rate hike to curb inflation.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 129.65 points to 17,540.42. The broader TOPIX index of all
first-section issues dropped 12.83 points or 0.74 percent to
1,726.18.
