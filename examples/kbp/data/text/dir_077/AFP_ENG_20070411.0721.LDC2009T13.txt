Visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao took his diplomatic charm
offensive to a Tokyo park early Thursday, taking a morning jog
and mingling with residents of the Japanese capital.


Sporting black sportswear bearing logos for next year's Beijing
Olympics, the 64 -year-old Wen jogged around the park, chatted
with members of the public and showed off a few tai chi moves.


"What do you do for a living?" Wen asked one woman through a
translator, as a group of security guards and Chinese ambassador
to Tokyo Wang Yi looked on.


"I am a barber," she replied in Japanese.


"I am Wen Jiabao," he replied.


"I saw you on TV," she said.


Wen jogged through the park before his address to the Japanese
parliament.


The first Chinese premier to visit Japan in seven years, Wen has
said he hoped his three-day visit to Japan would be an "ice-
melting" trip.


Immediately after arriving here Wednesday, Wen met with Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and the pair voiced their shared
resolve to build a new relationship of trust after years of
strained bilateral ties.


China had refused any summits with Abe's predecessor, Junichiro
Koizumi, due to the former premier's repeated visits during his
five-year tenure to a war shrine which Beijing and Seoul see as a
symbol of Japanese imperialism.
