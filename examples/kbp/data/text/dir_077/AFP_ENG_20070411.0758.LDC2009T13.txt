Kurt Vonnegut, the creator of wry science fiction and black
comedy, much of it built on his experience as a World War II
prisoner of war who survived the horrific Dresden bombing, died
late Tuesday, the New York times reported.


Vonnegut was the author of "SlaughterHouse Five," widely rated as
one of the finest American novels of the 20th century, "Cat's
Cradle," and "Breakfast of Champions."


He died in New York City after suffering brain injuries in a fall
several weeks ago, according to his longtime friend Morgan
Entrekin, the Times reported on its website Wednesday.
