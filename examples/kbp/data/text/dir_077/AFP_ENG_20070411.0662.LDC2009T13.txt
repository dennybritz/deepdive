Poland's parliament voted Wednesday to require elementary and
middle school students to wear school uniforms.


The legislation applies to students up to about age 16. High
school administrators can also require students to wear uniforms,
after consulting parents.


The measure was proposed by the far-right League of Polish
Families party, a member of the conservative ruling coalition.


Education minister and deputy prime minister Roman Giertych
pushed for the measure as a way of ending "fashion parades" in
schools and reinforcing discipline, as well as reducing parents'
expenses.


Giertych also promised state aid to families in need to purchase
uniforms at the start of the new school year in September.
