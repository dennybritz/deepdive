Australia's unemployment rate fell back to a 30-year low of 4.5
percent in March after briefly hitting 4.6 percent in February,
official figures showed Thursday.


The number of people employed increased by 10,500 to 10.3701
million on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said.


Prime Minister John Howard hailed the figures as reflecting the
success of his government's controversial new labour laws,
including the easing of unfair dismissal laws for small
businesses.
