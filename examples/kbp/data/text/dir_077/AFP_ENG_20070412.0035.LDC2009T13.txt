India on Thursday test-fired a nuclear-capable medium-range
ballistic missile which can reach the Chinese cities of Beijing
and Shanghai, defence sources said.


The launch of the Agni-III missile took place from Wheeler
Island, 180 kilometres (110 miles) northeast of Bhubaneswar, the
capital of eastern Orissa state.


It was the second test of the Agni-III, a two-stage solid fuelled
missile which has a diameter of 1.8 metres (six feet) and can
carry nuclear or conventional warheads.


The first test of the missile, which has a range of 4,000
kilometres (2,480 miles), ended in failure last July when it
crashed into the sea without hitting a designated target.
