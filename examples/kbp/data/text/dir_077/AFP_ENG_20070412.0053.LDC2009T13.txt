A man doused himself in kerosene and burnt himself to death in
east China in an apparent protest over the compensation he
received for his demolished home, state media reported Thursday.


Lu Erxiang, who was allegedly drunk, killed himself Wednesday at
the site of his former home in Chaohu city, Anhui province, as
more buildings were being knocked down to make way for a shopping
mall, the Jianghuai Morning Post said.


A police officer who tried to stop him also caught fire and was
still being treated for burn injuries, according to the paper.


Lu had signed an agreement about compensation with the property
developer in October, but now wanted more, according to the
paper.


As China's economy continues to race ahead, violent clashes over
land requisitions have become increasingly common as a result of
local officials' frequent collusion with property developers.


Chinese authorities are sensitive to signs of social unrest and
often mobilize large numbers of police to break up protests.
