A strike Thursday by air traffic controllers at Paris' two main
airports was expected to cause widespread delays, France's civil
air authority said.


As many as one in three flights at Charles de Gaulle airport and
one in two at Orly could face delays or cancellation, the DGAC
warned.


Air France, which was forced to cancel several short- and medium-
haul flights from Orly, said it had taken steps to ensure that
all passengers reach their destinations.


Long-haul flights and traffic to and from Charles de Gaulle
should be unaffected, it added.


Workers belonging to two unions are protesting plans to merge air
traffic control operations for the Paris region at one site
separate from the airports.
