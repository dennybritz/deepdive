An elderly South African pilot who spent three days stranded in
the Kalahari desert after his light aircraft ran out of fuel has
been found alive and well in Botswana, reports said Thursday.


Charles Wooler, 68, was found on Wednesday following an intensive
search involving the Botswana military and wildlife trackers
after they had located his two-seater aircraft and read a note in
which he said he was walking south.


Wooler is believed to have run out of fuel after experiencing
navigational equipment failure as he flew from Namibia to his
hometown of Upington in the Northern Cape on Sunday.


Chris Martinus, who had been flying ahead of Wooler when they
lost contact, said that his friend was in "tip-top" shape.


"They found him alive and well ... For a little bugger like him,
he's in remarkably good shape," he was quoted as saying by The
Star newspaper.


The hunt for Wooler was coordinated by the South African Search
and Rescue Organisation (Sasar) whose spokeswoman said five
planes were involved in the search as well as the trackers who
followed his footprints through the sand.


"They know the area like the back of their hands," said Sasar
spokeswoman Santje White.


He was eventually spotted by a Botswana army helicopter around 65
kilometers (40 miles) from the border with South Africa.


He was taken to hospital for a check-up but was expected to
return home on Thursday.
