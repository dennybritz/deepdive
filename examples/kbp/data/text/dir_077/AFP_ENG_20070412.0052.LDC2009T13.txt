All Black rugby winger Sitiveni Sivivatu escaped a conviction
Thursday which could have ended his World Cup dreams after
admitting in court to a charge of assaulting his wife.


Judge Phillip Connell said publicity surrounding the case was
sufficient penalty and discharged Sivivatu without conviction,
saying the assault was at the lower end of the scale of
offending.


Earlier, the court was told the star winger would be unable to
play in this year's World Cup in France if convicted and would be
unable to travel to some countries.


But the judge refused a request by Sivivatu and his wife for his
name to continue to be suppressed.


"I'm really sorry about what I did, I totally regret it,"
Sivivatu told reporters afterwards. "I just want to move on."


The Fijian-born winger was charged after police were called to
his home on March 19 after he slapped his wife twice. The judge
said the injuries to Sivivatu's wife were minor.


Sivivatu was also ordered to pay court costs of 300 dollars (218
US) and to pay 1,000 dollars to a charity.


The 24-year-old has scored 14 tries in 12 Tests for the All
Blacks since his debut in 2005 and plays in the Super 14
competition for the Waikato Chiefs.
