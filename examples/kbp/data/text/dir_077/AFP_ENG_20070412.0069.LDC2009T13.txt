Several Air France flights from Paris' Orly airport were
cancelled on Thursday after air traffic controllers went on
strike, airport and airline officials said.


But no flight cancellations were reported out of the Charles de
Gaulle international airport, said a spokesman for the Aeroports
de Paris management company and Air France.


A spokesman for civil aviation authorities confirmed that the
strike had a "strong following" at Orly, which provides flights
to cities throughout France and to nearby European destinations.


Workers belonging to two unions are protesting at plans to merge
air traffic control operations for the Paris region at one site
separate from the airports.
