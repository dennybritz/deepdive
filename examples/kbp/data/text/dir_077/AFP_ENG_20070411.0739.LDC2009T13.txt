Hong Kong share prices opened 0.38 percent lower Thursday on
profit-taking after recent gains, amid fresh worries over
inflation and interest rates, dealers said.


The fall on Wall Street overnight and a drop in Tokyo morning
trade also weighted on sentiment, they said.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 77.1 points at 20,372.33.
