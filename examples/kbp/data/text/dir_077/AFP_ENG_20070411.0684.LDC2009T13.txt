US President George W. Bush vowed Wednesday to veto legislation
lifting his restrictions on human embryonic stem-cell research
after the Senate passed a bill removing the limits.


"This bill crosses a moral line that I and many others find
troubling," Bush said in a statement. "If it advances all the way
through Congress to my desk, I will veto it."


The Senate voted 63-34 in favor of a bill lifting a restriction
on using federal funds for stem-cell research on human embryos,
but the tally was short of the two-third majority that would be
needed to overturn a veto.


The House of Representatives passed a similar version of the bill
in January, but the 253-174 vote was also short of a two-thirds
majority.
