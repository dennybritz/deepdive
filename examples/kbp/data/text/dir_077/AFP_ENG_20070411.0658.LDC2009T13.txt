Argentine football legend Diego Maradona, just released from the
hospital, vowed Wednesday to be in the stadium Sunday to watch
his former team Boca Juniors play bitter rivals River Plate.


Maradona, who is idolized in Argentina, has a special booth at
the Boca stadium open to him for life.


"On Sunday I will go (to the stadium), with IV, with my doctor,
in ambulance, however," Maradona said in a telephone interview
with TyC Sports channel after being released from a 13-day stay
at the hospital.


The former Argentina captain, 46, was discharged from Guemes
Sanatorium, where he had been treated for toxic hepatitis induced
by over-drinking, just after midnight Tuesday (0300 GMT
Wednesday).


Maradona, speaking with difficulty, vowed to go see Boca "until I
use the last drop of my blood."


"On Sunday we'll win," he added, as his ex-team prepared for a
clash of Argentina's football titans.


Maradona also praised River Plate forward Ariel "Burrito" Ortega,
who also has problems with alcohol. Ortega has played for
Argentina in the last three World Cup tournaments.


Maradona's personal doctor, Alfredo Cahe, said at a news
conference Wednesday that he was "astonished" by the 1986 World
Cup winners's good condition.


His recovery was "so surprising" that the former Barcelona and
Napoli star may be healthy enough to go to the stadium on Sunday,
he said.


Maradona was rushed to the Guemes Sanatorium on March 28. He lost
between six and seven kilos (13 and 15 pounds) during the
hospital stay, Cahe said.
