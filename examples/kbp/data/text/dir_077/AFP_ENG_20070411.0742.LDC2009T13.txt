Taiwanese prosecutors said Thursday two executives of BenQ Corp
have been questioned in regards to alleged insider trading
involving seven million company shares.


BenQ's chairman K.Y. Lee and president Sheaffer Lee were released
on a bail of 15 million Taiwan dollars (about 454,500 US) and 10
million dollars, respectively, after preliminary questioning
Wednesday, the prosecutors said.


The two were banned from leaving the country without prior
approval of the prosecuting authorities, said Chang Chin-feng, a
spokesman for the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office.


Last month prosecutors raided the offices of BenQ and questioned
several commpany officials including senior vice president Eric
Yu, who has been detained since for his alleged role in the
insider trading case.


According to prosecutors, several BenQ executives sold some seven
million shares between January-March 2006 before the company on
March 14 2006 disclosed heavy losses for the fourth quarter of
2005.


BenQ announced in September 2006 the closure of its German mobile
phone division, just a year after buying it from German group
Siemens, while assessing its operations in other countries.


BenQ, which also makes flatscreen TVs, scanners and CD-Rom
drives, is struggling to establish itself in the mobile phone
market where it trails behind Nokia, Motorola and Samsung.
