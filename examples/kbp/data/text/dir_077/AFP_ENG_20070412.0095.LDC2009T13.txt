South Korea's leading steelmaker POSCO said Thursday its
operating profit jumped 41 percent year-on-year in the three
months to March, backed by firm prices and cost reductions.


Its first-quarter operating profit rose to 1.113 trillion won
(1.95 billion dollars) from 790 billion won a year earlier.
Compared with the previous quarter, the operating profit was up
1.5 percent.


Net profit grew to 982 billion won in the first quarter, up 44
percent from a year earlier and up 4.9 percent from the previous
quarter, beating the market consensus of 884 billion won.


Sales stood at 5.701 trillion won (6.1 billion dollars) in the
first quarter, up 22.2 percent year-on-year and up 5.4 percent
quarter-on-quarter.


POSCO attributed the improvement to increased sales of high
value-added products, higher sales volume and firm pricing.


"Firm pricing for our key products and continued cost reduction
efforts helped our profitability in the first quarter," a
spokeswoman said.


"This year's global demand for steel is expected to rise 5.9
percent on the back of BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China).
Domestic demand will also increase, pulled by shipbuilders and
carmakers," said Lee Dong-Hee, chief financial officer.
