Israel's Finance Minister Avraham Hirshson was being questioned
by police again on Thursday as part of a probe into corruption in
a labour union he once headed, police said.


"The finance minister is being questioned today for the fourth
time in this affair by inspectors from the financial
investigations unit," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP.


Police have been investigating Hirshson for weeks over suspicions
of involvement in aggravated robbery and fraud, embezzlement,
obstruction of justice and conspiring to commit a crime. Hirshson
has denied the allegations.


In January, police confirmed media reports that a graft probe had
been launched against Hirshson, the latest in a string of Israeli
officials to face corruption charges.


The allegations are part of an investigation into embezzlement of
millions of dollars from the right-wing National Workers
Federation labour body.


Corruption probes and other scandals involving senior Israeli
officials have rocked the Jewish state during the past six
months.


Among them have been several graft probes against Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert and a looming rape indictment against President Moshe
Katsav, who has since taken a leave of absence from the largely
ceremonial post.
