Defending champ Mardy Fish crashed out of the 416,000 dollar ATP
US Clay Court Championships Wednesday, losing 7-5, 6-4 to Mariano
Zabaleta.


The Argentine qualifier, whose best surface is clay, broke Fish
four times while losing his serve twice.


The 29-year-old Zabaleta was sidelined nearly five months last
year with a knee injury and he finished out of the Top 100 for
the first time since 1997.  He will take on Austria's Jurgen
Melzer in the quarterfinals.


A finalist here a year ago, the fifth-seeded Melzer moved on with
a 6-4, 6-2 triumph over Victor Hanescu of Romania.


Melzer, who reached the final at Las Vegas earlier this season,
He looked better than he did Tuesday, when he needed three sets
to get past Rainer Schuettler of Germany and end a two-match
slide.


The highest seed in action Wednesday was No. 3 Tommy Haas of
Germany, who had to scramble a bit for a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory
over American Sam Querrey in a first- round encounter.


Haas reached the semifinals here last year but had to retire with
a wrist injury.  He also reached the semifinals of the Australian
Open and won at Memphis but lost his first match at Miami last
month.


Haas improved to 3-0 all-time vs. Querrey, with all three wins
coming this year. His next foe will be Nicolas Devilder of
France.


Other second-round matches saw Albert Montanes of Spain get past
Dusan Vemic of Serbia, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
