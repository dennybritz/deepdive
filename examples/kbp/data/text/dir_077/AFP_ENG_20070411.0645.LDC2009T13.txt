The United Nations has named a new chief envoy for Gambia after
the previous envoy was expelled early this year for doubting
President Yahya Jammeh's claim that he can cure AIDS, the UN said
Wednesday.


The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said in a
statement that Adama Guindo, a Malian, assumed duty in Banjul
Wednesday.


He replaced Fadzai Gwaradzimba, a Zimbabwean expelled in February
after expressing concern that Jammeh's controversial assertions
that he can cure AIDS could encourage careless sexual behaviour
among the population.


Gambia's state Daily Observer, described her comments as
"irresponsible".


Jammeh claims to have mystical powers and herbs to treat HIV/AIDS
and asthma within three days.


Guindo was previously acting UNDP chief in Senegal.
