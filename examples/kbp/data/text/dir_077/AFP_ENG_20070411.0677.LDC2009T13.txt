An exclusive Swiss health spa sued Ritz-Carlton hotels Wednesday,
accusing the chain of improperly profiting from its name and
reputation.


Clinique La Prairie, which operates a spa and medical center in
Montreux, Switzerland, filed suit in New York, accusing Ritz-
Carlton of violating its trademark and demanding that the hotel
stop using the name.


The Ritz-Carlton's flagship New York hotel operates a spa named
La Prairie.


"We believe the Ritz-Carlton is confusing consumers and degrading
the reputation of Clinique La Prairie," the Swiss company's owner
Armin Mattli said in a statement.


"We believe they are leading customers to think they are getting
Clinique La Prairie's unique spa treatment... This is not
acceptable," he added.
