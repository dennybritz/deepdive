Drew Bledsoe is walking away from the National Football League,
according to a newspaper report.


The Dallas Morning News reported on Wednesday that Bledsoe
announced his retirement after a 14-year career in football.


Bledsoe, the top pick by New England in the 1993 draft out of
Washington State, threw for 44,611 yards - the seventh most in
history.


A four-time Pro Bowl quarterback, Bledsoe led the Patriots to two
Super Bowls, losing to the Packers in the 1996 season and winning
as a backup to Tom Brady five years later against the St. Louis
Rams.
