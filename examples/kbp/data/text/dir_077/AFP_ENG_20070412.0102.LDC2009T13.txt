A rapist-murderer who defenders argued  was mentally retarded and
therefore protected from the death penalty has been executed in
Texas, the 12th person put to death in the state this year and
the 13th in all of the United States.


The Texas Department of Criminal Justice announced late Wednesday
that James Clark, 38, was pronounced dead at 6:17 pm (2317 GMT),
seven minutes after a lethal injection was administered at the
Huntsville prison.


Clark, who was sentenced to death three years ago for robbing,
raping and murdering 17-year-old Shari Catherine Crews in 1993,
made no final statement before the execution, attended by his
wife and father-in-law and friends and family of the woman he
killed.


Defenders and rights groups including Amnesty International had
argued that Clark was tested to have an IQ of only 65, making him
legally mentally retarded and protected from execution by a 2002
Supreme Court ruling.


But a Texas judge rejected the argument and accepted the view of
a controversial expert witness who said that Clark was faking his
mental retardation, according to Amnesty.
