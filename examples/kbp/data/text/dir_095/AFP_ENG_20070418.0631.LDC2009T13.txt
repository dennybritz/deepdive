Authorities in Equatorial Guinea have decided to reopen a border
post with Cameroon after having closed it following attacks in
the northeast blamed on Cameroon nationals, state radio said
Wednesday.


Equatorial Guinea had closed the border at Ebebiyin in January
after a string of attacks blamed on "delinquents" from Cameroon
in the area.


Relations between the two countries have been periodically
disturbed by incidents linked to immigration.


Hundreds of Cameroon nationals were expelled from Equatorial
Guinea in 2004, with Malabo accusing them of being in the country
illegally. Several of those expelled accused Malabo police of
violence and arbitrary arrests.
