A volcano in southern Colombia erupted on Wednesday, causing
major landslides, destroying bridges, homes and fields and
forcing some 8,000 people to flee their homes.


After flying over the devastated areas around the Nevado de
Huila, authorities said they had no immediate indications of
casualties among residents of the region, most of whom are
indigenous Colombians.


The 5,631-meter (18,474-foot) Andean volcano, has been active
since February, after remaining dormant for about 500 years,
local authorities said.


"There's a strong smell of sulphur and we know the avalanche
swept away several pedestrian bridges and one vehicular bridge,"
said Daisy Jimena Medina, an official at the municipal offices of
Popayan, the regional capital.


"We are cut off from land access," she said.


Officials said homes and fields were covered in rocks and mud.


Alberto Nunez, a director of the state geological institute
Ingeominas, said that following the early morning eruption, "the
volcano started decreasing its seismic activity."


In 1994, an earthquake killed 1,100 people in the same region.
