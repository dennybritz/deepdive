Pope Benedict XVI received several birthday cakes on Wednesday,
two days after he turned 80, from pilgrims who turned up for his
weekly general audience.


Some of the cakes came from the town of Deggendorfer, Germany,
and he made sure to express his thanks in the German portion of
his remarks before some 45,000 pilgrims who filled a sun-drenched
St Peter's Square.


A brass band from his native Bavaria added to the festive
atmosphere.


Benedict marked his birthday -- as well as the second anniversary
of his election as pope, which falls on Thursday -- with a mass
in the square on Sunday.


On his actual birthday on Monday the pontiff lunched with
cardinals and enjoyed a classical music concert.
