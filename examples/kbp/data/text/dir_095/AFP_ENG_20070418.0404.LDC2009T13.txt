French engineering giant Alstom and nuclear group Areva on
Wednesday said they had appealed against fines imposed by the
European Union in January for allegedly taking part in a price
fixing cartel.


Spokesmen for the two companies said separately the two groups
were lodging "an appeal before the EU's court of first instance
against the Brussels sanctions."


They declined further comment.


Japan's Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi and Toshiba and Germany's
Siemens have also said they are appealing the fines, which were
imposed as part of a wider crackdown on European and Japanese
firms accused of colluding in the power- generation equipment
market.


EU regulators charge that between 1988 and 2004 the companies
rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, divided up
projects among each other and shared sensitive information in the
market for equipment called gas insulated switchgear (GIS).


The EU competition watchdog imposed a total fine of 750 million
euros (one billion euros) -- its second-biggest to date -- on the
firms, which also included ABB, Fuji, Mitsubishi Electric
Corporation, Schneider, Siemens and VA Tech.


Alstom was fined 11.5 million euros (15.6 million dollars), plus
53.5 million euros jointly with Areva.
