The Estonian Defence Ministry said Wednesday it will start
excavations next week at a controversial Soviet war memorial, a
move likely to provoke anger in neighbouring Russia.


Defence Minister Jaak Aaviksoo said in a letter to Tallinn city
authorities that the ministry will decide over the course of the
excavation work where to re- inter the remains of soldiers who
are assumed to lie under the monument.


Authorities have said previously that the dig should take about
10 days.


The monument, a large bronze statue of a Red Army soldier that
stands at a busy public transport stop in the heart of Tallinn,
has become a major source of controversy between Estonia and
Russia.


Estonia's decision to move it to a less central location has
provoked angry outbursts from Moscow.


Russia sees it as a memorial to those who defeated Nazi Germany
during World War II but to many Estonians, it is a painful
reminder of 50 years of post-war occupation by the Soviets, whose
hold in the Baltic state only ended in 1991.
