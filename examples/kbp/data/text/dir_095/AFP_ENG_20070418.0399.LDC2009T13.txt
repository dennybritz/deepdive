The prime minister of ex-Soviet Georgia, Zurab Nogaideli, will
undergo heart surgery Thursday at a clinic in Houston, Texas, a
senior government official said.


"The prime minister's condition is quite satisfactory and he is
completely ready for tomorrow's operation in Houston," the head
of the government administration, Petre Mamradze, told AFP in
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.


Mamradze said the operation was not urgent and that Nogaideli
opted to have the surgery in the United States after a week-long
official visit to meet with White House and State Department
officials.


He said Nogaideli was expected to spend no more than two weeks in
the United States recovering.


There have no been no previous reports of Nogaideli suffering
health problems.


He became premier in early 2005 following the death of prime
minister Zurab Zhvania from carbon monoxide poisoning.
