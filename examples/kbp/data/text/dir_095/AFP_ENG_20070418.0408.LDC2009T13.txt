Police on Wednesday briefly cordoned off a building at the
Virginia university still shaken by Monday's massacre but the
alert turned out to be a false alarm.


The security scare rattled some students who have remained on the
Virginia Tech University campus following Monday's shooting
rampage by a South Korean student, Cho Seung-Hui, in which 33
people died including the gunman.


"Oh my God, it's starting all over again," said student Petty
Wingler, 21, as armed police with sniffer dogs descended on an
administrative building next to Norris Hall, the engineering
building attacked by Cho on Monday.


A police officer told reporters there had been a "report of
unusual activity" at Burruss Hall, the university's main
administrative building.


"It turned out to be unfounded. The site is safe," he said.


Local media reported a call had been received threatening the
life of University president Charles Steger.


"In the wake of what is taking place on this campus, having these
kinds of call is not unusual," Corinne Geller, a police
spokeswoman, told reporters.


"We are maintaining high police visibility," on campus, Virginia
Tech police chief Wendell Flinchum told reporters later.


Virginia Tech has cancelled classes for the remainder of the week
following Monday's rampage by the 23-year-old Cho, who has been
described by students and teachers as a sullen and troubled
loner.
