Toyota Motor Corp. broke ground on its eighth North American
manufacturing plant Wednesday, a 1.3 billion-dollar facility in
Blue Springs, Mississippi.


The new plant will help the Japanese automaker expand its North
American operations to 15 plants by 2010 with the annual capacity
to build some 2.2 million cars and trucks, 1.45 million engines
and 600,000 automatic transmissions.


"Our goal is to make a positive contribution to the community
while beginning a new partnership with local citizens," Toyota
president Katsuaki Watanabe said at the groundbreaking ceremony.


"We will make every effort to be the best business partner in
Mississippi and thank Governor (Harley) Barbour and all citizens
for their warm welcome."


The Mississippi plant will have a capacity of 150,000 vehicles
and will produce Toyota's Highlander sports utility vehicle.
Production is set to begin in 2010.
