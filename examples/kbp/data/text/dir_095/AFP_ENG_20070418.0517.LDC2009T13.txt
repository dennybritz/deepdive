Police in Bavaria in southern Germany on Wednesday said they
seized cash, computers, mobile phones and documents in    raids
on 32 suspected members of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK).


The police said they are being investigated on suspicion of
belonging to an illegal association, although one man was
arrested.


The targets of the raid have been under investigation since 2005
and are believed to have sold illegal publications and collected
funds for the PKK, which has fought for self-rule in the
predominantly Kurdish southeast of Turkey since 1984.


The conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives.


Thirty-five pieces of evidence plus 16,000 euros (21,700 dollars)
in bank notes were confiscated in the raids in Nuremberg and
Ingolstadt carried out by more than 170 police officers.


The PKK is regarded as a terrorist organisation by the European
Union, the United States and Turkey.
