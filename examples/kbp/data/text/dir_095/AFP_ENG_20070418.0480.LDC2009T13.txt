A debt of 15 million dollars is hampering West Indies cricket
development, the president of the West Indies Cricket Board
(WICB) Ken Gordon has admitted.


The WICB has blamed their cash-strapped state for being unable to
launch their long-awaited regional development plan.


"Financially we have had no basis on which to do it. We have just
been strapped financially," Gordon told the Caribbean Media
Corporation.


"We are now at a point where we are breaking even operationally
but we have a 15 million dollar deficit. That's what we are
carrying on our backs. How do you get into development?"


The future of West Indies cricket has been dragged into sharp
focus by the team's failure to reach the World Cup semi-finals.


"We we're at the point now where we have had a development
programme for the last year. It's drafted, it's ready to go,"
said Gordon.


Under the terms of the plan, regional players will hopefully be
honed to international standards while coaching standards are
expected to rise.
