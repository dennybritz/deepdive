Nigeria is preparing a battalion of some 700 soldiers to join a
UN and African Union peacekeeping force in Sudan's troubled
Darfur region, an army spokesman said Wednesday.


"Right now we have a battalion undergoing simulation training
ahead of their deployment to Darfur. This is part of Nigeria's
obligations to the UN and AU," Colonel Ayo Olaniyan told AFP.


An African Union force of some 7,000 troops has failed to stem
the violence in Darfur, where more than 200,000 people are
estimated to have been killed and two million others displaced
since 2003.


The international community is pressing Khartoum to accept a
20,000-strong hybrid UN-AU peacekeeping force.


The violence in Darfur, an area roughly the size of France, stems
from a conflict between government forces, allied Janjaweed Arab
militias and rebel groups who have taken up arms in protest at
the distribution of resources.
