British rock star Pete Doherty, partner of supermodel Kate Moss,
hinted during a court hearing Wednesday that she had given him an
ultimatum over his drug use.


"The people I'm closest to have had enough. They say it's drugs
or them," he told a court in London, where he was appearing for a
review of a drug treatment order.


The Babyshambles frontman, 28, added that "a lot has changed in
the last week" without elaborating further.


At a concert last week he referred to Moss, with whom he has had
an on-off relationship since 2005, as his "fiancee", fuelling
speculation that the pair are set to marry.


Doherty arrived 30 minutes late for his hearing at Thames
Magistrates' Court, east London, but was praised by District
Judge Jane McIvor for showing "more than cooperation" with the
legal proceedings.


The troubled star has repeatedly sought treatment for drug
addiction in countries including Britain, France and Thailand.


In December he was fined 770 pounds (1,144 euros, 1,523 dollars)
and banned from driving for four months for possessing illegal
drugs, including crack cocaine and heroin.


Earlier this month, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards
predicted Doherty's drug habits could kill him and warned Moss.


"My advice for Pete Doherty is that he should shut ... up and
leave her, " he told the New Musical Express (NME) magazine.


"I don't know the man, all I know is he's pushing his luck and
there it is, but so is Kate, who I know very well.


"Kate wants to play with bad boys and she's done one, and then
another one, and then another one. Badabing, badabing, badaboom.
She'll live, the boys will die."
