Former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing is backing
rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy for the presidency instead of the
candidate from his own centrist party Francois Bayrou.


Giscard d'Estaing, 81, said in an interview to Le Parisien
newspaper to be published Thursday that Sarkozy had the
experience and political clout needed to be France's next
president.


The ex-president from 1974 and 1981 said Sarkozy had a majority
in parliament to back him contrary to Bayrou whom he accused of
"fueling uncertainty, floating in a vacuum between obviously
different policies and beholden to powerless and fragile
majorities."


Giscard d'Estaing founded the small Union for French Democracy
(UDF) now headed by Bayrou, a 55-year-old former education
minister who holds the third place in polls behind Sarkozy and
Socialist Segolene Royal.


Voters in France head to the polls for the first round of the
presidential election on Sunday and the two top vote-getters are
expected to go into a runoff set for May 6.


Giscard d'Estaing appealed to voters "who share the values of the
centre" to vote for Sarkozy, the 52-year-old former interior
minister who is also the candidate of the governing Union for a
Popular Movement (UMP) party.
