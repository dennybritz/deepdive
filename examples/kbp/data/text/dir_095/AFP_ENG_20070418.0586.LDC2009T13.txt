Former France international footballer Raymond Kaelbel, a bronze
medal winner at the 1958 World Cup, has died at the age of 75
years, his former club Strasbourg confirmed Wednesday.


Capped 35 times as a defender for France, Kaelbel competed in two
World Cups in 1954 and 1958.


He played 500 first division matches in his career, training with
Colmar in his native Alsace before joining Strasbourg in 1950.


He went on to play for Monaco, winning the league title with them
in 1961. He also won two French Cup titles in 1960 and 1966.


After stints with Le Havre and Reims he returned to Strasbourg
from 1964 to 1969.


After retiring Kaelbel trained amateur sides in Alsace and was a
member of the administrative board of Strasbourg football club.
