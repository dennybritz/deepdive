Madonna on Wednesday chatted with street children and prostitutes
trying to scrape a living in one of Africa's poorest countries as
she visited a government-run rehabilitation centre in Lilongwe.


The singer spent around an hour at the centre which caters for
some 200 people in a closed-door session during an ongoing visit
to Malawi where she is helping pay for the construction of a
number of orphanages.


Journalists and photographers who have been covering the
"Material Girl's" three-day visit were not allowed into the
centre which is home to 22 street children and 15 sex workers.


A member of Madonna's entourage, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the singer wanted to show her support.


"Madonna purely came to visit and say hello and offer positivity
and support," the aide told AFP.


"Madonna is very concerned about children in need and children at
risk. She just wants in her own way to provide support and
awareness to children who are in need. She has a special place in
her heart for children."


The singer is in the process of adopting a one-year-old boy
called David who had been living in an orphanage near Lilongwe
after his mother died shortly after childbirth.
