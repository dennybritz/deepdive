The UN World Food Programme said Wednesday it had slashed food
aid to more than a million displaced people in northern Uganda
owing to a shortfall in donations.


The agency feeds nearly 1.3 million people displaced by fighting
between the Ugandan government and Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
rebels in the country's north.


"In April, WFP was forced to reduce the individual food aid
package for the displaced to just 40 percent of the minimum daily
energy requirement of 1,200 kilocalories because of a shortage of
contributions," the agency said in a statement.


In addition, it halved the already reduced rations for 182,000
refugees mainly from Sudan.


The agency called on donors to offer contributions to avoid
further disruption to the refugees who cannot till their land due
to the conflict.


WFP said it would maintain the current food rations to displaced
people and refugees until an increase in contributions.


"We expect new contributions will ease the pressure in June,"
said WFP official Josette Sheeran.


The LRA, which has fought a two-decade insurgency against the
government of President Yoweri Museveni, recently renewed a
ceasefire and agreed to resume peace talks.
