Two big British labor syndicates and a North American guild were
to announce plans Wednesday to move toward creation of the first
transatlantic trade union, a spokesman said.


Amicus, The Transport and General Workers Union (T&GWU) and
the United Steel Workers (USW) of America were to announce merger
talks, USW spokeswoman Pat Van Horne told AFP.


"It sets the stage for an exploration of the possibility of a
merger," she said. "It's a level of cooperation, it's taking that
level of cooperation to the next level."


A formal announcement by Amicus general secretary Derek Simpson
and USW president Leo Gerard was scheduled at noon (1600 GMT) in
Ottawa.


Amicus is already finalizing a merger with the Transport and
General Workers in Britain to be called Unite, and will represent
2.1 million members. The USW represents 850,000 members in the
United States and Canada.


The aim of the merger is to create "greater international
solidarity and cooperation to better represent workers against
the threats posed by global capital," the unions said in a
statement.


"The new agreement to be signed at the Wednesday event will be
the first step in establishing a truly global union."
