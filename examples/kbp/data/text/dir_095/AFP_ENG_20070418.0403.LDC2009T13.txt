Kazakhstan's journalists' union voiced concern on Wednesday at
the disappearance of a female journalist nearly three weeks
earlier, following threats on her life.


The journalist, 39-year-old Oralgaisha Zhabagtaikyzy, was last
seen by a friend on March 30 as she got into an unidentified
vehicle in Almaty to go to report on a recent armed clash between
rival ethnic-Chechen and Kazakh groups in the south of the
country.


Zhabagtaikyzy was employed by a journal known for covering
corruption issues, Zakon i Pravosudie.


She had recently bought herself a gun following the threats,
relatives said.


"She was not involved in business. She wasn't connected to the
political opposition. There can be no other explanation than this
being linked to her professional activities," said the director
of the journalists' union, Seitkazy Matayev, at a press
conference with relatives and colleagues of the journalist.


In an article published on March 26, the journalist accused
members of an ethnic-Chechen family of being involved in the
recent gun battle, which left five people dead, and described
them as being linked to a large Kazakh business and to law
enforcement structures.


Her family turned to police for help on April 9 after their own
search failed.


On Tuesday a group of parliament members appealed to Kazakh
security forces and the prosecutor to make every effort to
investigate the matter.
