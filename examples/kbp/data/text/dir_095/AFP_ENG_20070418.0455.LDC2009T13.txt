Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi on Wednesday named a
former warlord as the country's police chief and replaced the
foreign minister in a shake-up of top officials, a government
spokesman said.


Gedi appointed former Mogadishu warlord Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid
as the new police commissioner, replacing Ali Mohamed Loyan who
was appointed as the country's ambassador to Tanzania.


Somalia's national planning minister Hussein Elabe Fahiye was
named foreign minister, replacing Ismail Mohamed Hurrey who was
moved to the education portfolio.


Gedi fired former education minister Ali Abdi Awale for failing
in his duties, the deputy prime minister's spokesman, Abdullahi
Muhidin Odka, told a press conference.


Ali Abdullahi Osbley, who was fired from the cabinet in a
February reshuffle, was recalled as planning minister.


Qeybdid was among the warlords ousted from Mogadishu by an
Islamist movement last year, only to return early this year when
joint Somali-Ethiopian forces chased the Islamists from the
seaside capital.


Somalia, home to 10 million people, has lacked an effective
central authority since the 1991 ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad
Barre plunged the country into chaos.
