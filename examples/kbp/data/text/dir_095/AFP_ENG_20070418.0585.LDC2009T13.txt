Iran has assembled some 1,300 centrifuges at a key underground
nuclear plant and has started to feed them with the uranium gas
necessary for enriching uranium, the UN atomic watchdog said
Wednesday.


Iran has eight cascades of 164 centrifuges each at a heavily-
bunkered underground facility in Natanz and "some UF6 (uranium
hexafluoride) is being fed," a diplomat said.


The diplomat was quoting to AFP a confidential document the
International Atomic Energy Agency sent Wednesday to the 35
member states of its board of governors.
