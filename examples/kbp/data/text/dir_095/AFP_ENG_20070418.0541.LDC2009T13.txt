Sri Lanka seamer Farveez Maharoof gave Sri Lanka a World Cup
semi-final selection headache on Wednesday when he claimed four
victims in his team's Super Eights eight-wicket win over Ireland.


Maharoof, playing in the side because of an injury to Lasith
Malinga while Dilhara Fernando was rested, made a strong case to
retain his place for next Tuesday's semi-final in Jamaica with a
blistering performance with the ball.


He also ran out Ireland skipper Trent Johnston as Sri Lanka
bowled out their opponents for just 77 before wrapping up victory
comfortbaly before the lunch break at the Grenada National
Stadium.


"It's a good headache to have," said Sri Lanka captain Mahela
Jayawardene when quizzed if the 22-year-old Maharoof would start
the semi-final which is likely to be against New Zealand.


"Everyone in this squad has put their hands up when it comes to
performing. It would be a worse headache if we were not
performing.


"We have acheived our goal of making the semi-finals. When we
left Sri Lanka we knew we had to concentrate hard, we knew we had
the talent to make the last four but we just had to execute our
plans. That was the hardest thing."


Maharoof finished with four for 25 in 10 overs, a spell that saw
the pace bowler take three wickets in four balls in his first
over.


Muttiah Muralitharan also took four wickets as Ireland were
dismissed for just 77 - the sixth lowest total in the
competition's history.
