Russia's military launched a manhunt Wednesday after rebels in
the restive province of Dagestan killed a special forces officer
and injured two others, Russian news agencies reported.


The rebels, thought to number between five and 10, opened fire on
interior ministry forces as they were conducting an operation in
forest land in the coastal district of Karabudakhkent, Interfax
news agency quoted an unnamed police source as saying.


"Additional forces have been called in to track down and
liquidate the bandits. The area is being searched by dog
handlers," the source said.


A criminal case has been opened into the attack, the ITAR-TASS
news agency quoted district prosecutor Zubair Mamayev as saying.


Security forces had blown up a dugout used by the rebels and the
area had been cordoned off to prevent their escape, ITAR-TASS
reported.


Clashes occur regularly in the mainly Muslim province of
Dagestan, located on the Caspian Sea coast next to Chechnya.


Small-scale clashes also continue in Chechnya itself, where
Russia has fought two full-scale wars against separatists since
the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse.
