Tajikistan wants the Organisation for Security and Co-operation
in Europe to assist the country on economic projects, the foreign
minister said Wednesday.


"The OSCE's mandate is old. It has to be reviewed," said Minister
Khamrokhon Zarifi, whose country has been part of the
organisation since 1992 following the fall of the Soviet Union.


The minister said the country has set an objective of improving
the economic situation over a five-year period.
