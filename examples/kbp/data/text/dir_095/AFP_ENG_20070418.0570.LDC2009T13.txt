The UN atomic agency has dropped plans to install surveillance
cameras at an underground Iranian plant but feels it still has
adequate access in verifying Tehran does not seek nuclear
weapons, diplomats told AFP Wednesday.


Putting in the cameras was a key demand, but a deal struck with
Iran gives inspectors from the UN agency the right to make
unannounced on-site inspections at the Natanz uranium enrichment
plant, the diplomats said.
