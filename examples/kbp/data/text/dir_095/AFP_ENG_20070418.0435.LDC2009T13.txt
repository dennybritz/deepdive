The value of Indian-backed foreign takeovers hit a record in 2006
due to Tata Steel's purchase of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus,
according to data published Wednesday that highlighted the
financial firepower of corporate India.


Market researcher Dealogic revealed that Indian companies spent a
record 23.126 billion dollars (17.025 billion euros) in foreign
acquisitions last year.


That marked an increase of 417 percent compared with 4.469
billion dollars in 2005.


Around 57 percent of the total value of Indian takeovers in 2006
were in the steel and metals sector, according to Dealogic.


Tata Steel snapped up Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus last year for
13.7 billion dollars in what remains the biggest-ever foreign
takeover by a company in the Asian emerging power.


The purchase made Tata Steel, the flagship of Indian conglomerate
Tata, the world's fifth-largest steelmaker, vaulting it from 56th
place after beating Brazilian rival CSN in a bidding contest.


Since the beginning of 2007, the value of Indian-backed
acquisitions currently stands at 11.878 billion dollars, with 41
purchases agreed.


Dealogic added that the number of Indian takeovers of foreign
companies jumped last year by more than a fifth to 168, compared
with 137 deals in 2005.


Around half of the deals last year were in Europe, while just
under one quarter were conducted in North America.
