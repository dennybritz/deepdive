EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes and Polish Prime
Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski haggled Wednesday over aid to Polish
shipyards, which EU regulators are worried could distort
competition.


Kroes stressed that she would approve the state aid for the
shipyards only if it were part of package to restore their long-
term health and not a quick bail-out, according to a statement
from the European Commission.


In particular, EU regulators want the private sector to pick up a
chunk of the restructuring costs and production capacity to be
cut back so as not to stifle competition.


While Kroes was open to a "constructive" approach to the standoff
between Brussels and Warsaw, she said she would not allow a
"lenient" interpretation of state aid rules, the statement said.


The Dutch commissioner is to meet with the Polish Economic
Affairs Minister Piotr Wozniak in Brussels within the next few
weeks, it said.


The Commission has Poland in its sights over some 2.2 billion
zlotys (577 million euros, 784 million dollars) in state support
over recent years for the struggling Baltic coast shipyards of
Gdansk, Gdynia and Szczecin.


The Gdansk yard in particular holds historic importance for
Poles.


A strike by 17,000 workers in August 1980 at what was then the
Lenin Shipyard forced the authorities to the negotiating table
and led to the creation of Solidarity, the communist bloc's first
free trade union.
