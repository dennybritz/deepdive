Workers in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz staged a
general strike on Wednesday to protest againt the closure of a
plant owned by bankrupt US auto parts supplier Delphi.


Stores and factories remained closed, garbage went uncollected
while public transportation was reduced to a minimum, unions
said.


"Society responded massively to the strike call," said a
spokesman for CCOO, one of the unions which organized the action
that was backed by 14 municipalities in the region of some
800,000 people.


Delphi announced in February that it would close its plant in
Puerto Real which employs 1,600 people. Unions argue some 4,000
additional jobs indirectly linked to the site could be affected
by the closure.


Delphi employees and their supporters have staged regular
protests since the closure was announced.
