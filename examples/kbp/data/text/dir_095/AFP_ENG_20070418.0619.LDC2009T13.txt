Lyon were forced to put their celebrations of a sixth straight
French league title on ice Wednesday after being held to a
goalless draw at home by midtable Rennes.


The draw has however virtually clinched it for the champions as
they now have an 18-point advantage on second-placed Toulouse
with six games to go.


Toulouse would have had to win all six games by big margins and
Lyon to lose all six to overhaul the champions.
