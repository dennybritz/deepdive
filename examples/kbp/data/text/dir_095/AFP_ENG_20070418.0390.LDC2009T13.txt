Research in Motion Ltd. said Wednesday a network outage had
stunted its hugely popular wireless Blackberry e-mail service.


"We are currently experiencing a service interruption that is
causing delays in sending or receiving messages," said an
automated message at RIM's customer support center.


A spokesman for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company was not
immediately available.


According to reports, the system failed Tuesday night and stopped
delivering e-mails to the handheld devices.


Research in Motion is the market leader for mobile e-mail devices
with more than seven million users of its BlackBerry worldwide.


Technology analyst Jeff Kagan commented: "The rapid subscriber
growth, plus the runaway junk e-mail boom, equals a disaster in
the making. Networks work fine until they reach their capacity,
then all sorts of strange things happen."


"This is a sampling of the chaos we could be working through if
we have a meltdown of our networks, or a terrorist attack.
Terrorists could cause so much more damage breaking our
networks," Kagan added.


Kagan also predicted that Research in Motion would "take a hit"
because of this glitch, but added Blackberry users would
"probably come back because the users are almost rabid."
