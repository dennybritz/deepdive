escort for a special love trip to Belgium where the pachyderm is
set to impregnate three females, the ANP news agency reported.

kilos (5.5 tons) and is a stud who has already made the rounds of
the European zoo circuit. At the moment three elephants are
pregnant by him and he has another six descendants.


Alexander will remain in the Antwerp Zoo until September to
fulfill his duties.
