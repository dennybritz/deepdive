US President George W. Bush on Wednesday bluntly warned that
Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir had a "last chance" to help end
violence in Darfur or face tougher US sanctions and other
measures.


"The time for promises is over, President Bashir must act," Bush
said in remarks at the Holocaust Museum in Washington. "If
President Bashir does not meet his obligation, the United States
will act."
