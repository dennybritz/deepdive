Scotland scrum-half Chris Cusiter has signed to play for French
club Perpignan following the Scottish Rugby Union's decision to
scrap his current side Border Reivers for financial reasons.


Cusiter, capped 31 times by his country, was the captain of
Borders, which will be disolved at the end of the season after
the SRU decided that Scotland could support only two professional
outfits -- Edinburgh and Glasgow.


"With the unfortunate news that the Reivers will close at the end
of the season, I felt like I needed a change," said Cusiter, who
has signed a two-year deal with the club based in the Catalan
corner of southern France.


"So the prospect of playing for a big club like Perpignan, who
have a great set- up and a massive following, was too good to
turn down."


He added: "The Borders gave me my start in professional rugby so
I owe them a lot. I'm now setting my sights on getting into the
Scotland squad for the World Cup before joining my new club."


Reivers head coach Steve Bates paid tribute to Cusiter's
contribution in his four years at the club.


"He is a well respected member of the team and a consummate
professional," Bates said.
