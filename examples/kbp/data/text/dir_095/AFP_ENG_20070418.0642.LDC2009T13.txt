A 17-member military junta stepping down for a civilian
democratic ruler in Mauritania on Wednesday vowed to loyally
serve the country's new authorities.


The junta "affirms the commitment of the armed forces to loyally
serve the new institutions of the constitutional state conforming
to the legal principles of the republic," it said in a statement
on the eve of the investiture of a new civilian leader.


The Military Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD) stormed
into office in August 2005 after ousting, in a bloodless coup,
the autocratic ruler Maaouiya Ould Taya who ruled the country
with an iron fist for 20 years.


It declared its support at the end of its final meeting after 19
months in power and hours before handing over power to President
Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, elected in Mauritania's first
democratic polls.


Among foreign leaders billed to witness the swearing-in
ceremonies on Thursday are the presidents of Senegal, Mali,
Niger, Togo, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.


The new Prime Minister of Ivory Coast, Guillaume Soro, the US
Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and the defense
minister of former colonial ruler France, Michele Alliot-Marie,
are also expected at the ceremony.
