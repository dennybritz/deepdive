US President George W. Bush hailed Wednesday's Supreme Court
decision upholding a ban on late-term "partial-birth abortion"
which he said affirms the "culture of life" espoused by many
Americans.


"The partial-birth abortion ban, which an overwhelming bipartisan
majority in Congress passed and I signed into law, represents a
commitment to building a culture of life in America," the US
president said, adding that efforts to outlaw the "abhorrent
procedure" reflect "the compassion and humanity of America."


"The Supreme Court's decision is an affirmation of the progress
we have made over the past six years in protecting human dignity
and upholding the sanctity of life," the US president said.


"We will continue to work for the day when every child is
welcomed in life and protected in law."


The US Supreme Court decision backtracked on abortion rights for
the first time in more than a generation, upholding a five-year
old federal law restricting access to a rare but controversial
late-term abortion procedure.


The bellwether ruling is a major victory for conservative forces
in the United States, which have battled for decades to reverse
the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade law establishing a woman's legal
right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
