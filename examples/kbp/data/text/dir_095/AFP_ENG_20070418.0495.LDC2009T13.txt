More than 30 rightwing extremists were arrested across Portugal
on Wednesday, some caught red-handed in possession of weapons and
others accused of racist crimes, a police source said.


The arrests, which followed police raids in Lisbon and northern
Portugal, were confirmed by Jose Pinto Coelho who heads up the
tiny far right National Renewal Party.


The sweep comes three days ahead of the party's congress in
Lisbon which is expected to be attended by members from
nationalist and extreme rightwing groups from across Europe.
