The US Supreme Court retrenched access to abortion for the first
time in more than a generation Wednesday, upholding a 2003
federal law restricting access to a rare but controversial late-
term abortion procedure.


The bellwether ruling is a major victory for conservative forces
in the United States, which have battled for decades to reverse
the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade law establishing a woman's legal
right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.


The five-to-four decision in a case challenging the
constitutionality of a ban on what critics call "partial birth
abortion" is a reflection of the impact of the recent addition to
the US high court of two conservative justices appointed by US
President George W. Bush.


Abortion opponents condemn the procedure as infanticide, because
the head and torso of the fetus is delivered intact while alive,
but the fetus does not die until doctors extract its brain.
