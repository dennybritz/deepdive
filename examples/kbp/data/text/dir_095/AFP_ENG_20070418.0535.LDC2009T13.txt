The commander of US forces in the Middle East expressed concern
Wednesday about the threat of Turkish military action in northern
Iraq against Kurdish rebels.


"It's one of the concerns, and I certainly hope they don't carry
out this threat and we're trying to convince them this is not a
good idea," said Admiral William Fallon, the head of the US
Central Command.


Turkey's army chief, General Yasar Buyukanit, last week called
for a military incursion into northern Iraq to hunt down Kurdish
rebels.


Fallon told lawmakers he has pressed Kurdish leaders in northern
Iraq to stop Kurdish separatist groups like the PKK that have
been instigating violence in Turkey.


"Because at the end of the day, it's going to be certainly to
their decided disadvantage and hurtful to not only that region
but to the whole country if the Turks carry out this threat.


"We are working to try to play a role to try to get this activity
stopped," he said.
