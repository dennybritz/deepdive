A leftist Basque group close to the banned Basque separatist
party Batasuna will not contest next month's local elections in
Spain, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Wednesday.


"The Basque communist party will not be present in the municipal
elections ... they will not be there because they are not
enrolled," he said at a news conference.


Spain's main opposition Popular Party had asked for the communist
party to be banned after reports emerged linking it to Batasuna
and the armed Basque separatist group ETA.


Batasuna was banned under a 2003 law which required all political
parties to denounce violence. It has refused to break
definitively with ETA, whose armed 38-year campaign for Basque
independence has claimed over 800 lives.
