The UN food agency on Wednesday asked donors to pitch in funds to
avoid a looming humanitarian crisis in the Central African
Republic where some 230,000 people have been displaced by unrest.


"The situation in the Central African Republic is serious and
continues to worsen due to violence and the conflict in Darfur,"
in nearby Sudan which has seen tens of thousands of refugees pour
into the country and Chad, the World Food Programme said in a
statement.


WFP executive director Josette Sheeran said the body would need
44 million dollars (32 million euros) to feed 230,000 people in
the Central African Republic.


The northern part of the country, one of the world's poorest
nations, has been wracked by violence and banditry staged by
rebels opposed to President Francois Bozize, who came to power
after a 2003 coup.


Fighting has led to numerous deaths and the displacement of more
than 280,000 people, according to the United Nations.
