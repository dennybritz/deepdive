Australian actor Eric Bana is to star in a movie adaptation of
Audrey Niffnegger's novel "The Time Traveler's Wife," it was
reported on Wednesday.


Bana, the star of "Munich" and "The Hulk," will play a Chicago
librarian who is affected by a gene that causes him to hurtle
backwards and forwards through time involuntarily, The Hollywood
Reporter reported.


Canadian actress Rachel McAdams of the "Wedding Crashers" and
"The Family Stone" fame, will co-star as Bana's love interest,
the report said.
