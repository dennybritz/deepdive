Britain's growing obesity problem is forcing crematoria to build
bigger furnaces because of the broader coffins of their expanding
clientele, officials said Wednesday.


Standard coffins are typically between 22-26 inches (55-65
centimetres) wide, but many undertakers now use super-size 40
inch-wide casks to accommodate bigger bodies.


"As long as the nation keeps on piling on the pounds, pressure
will continue to be placed on crematoria," said Hazel Harding of
the Local Government Association (LGA), which has to deal with
funding for the building work.


"This is just another demonstration of how the UK's obesity
problem is putting a real strain on public services."


The development follows a trend in the United States, where
"supersize" coffins up to 44 inches across have been available
for a number of years.


At the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management,
officials are well aware of changing needs.


"The Institute has received calls from funeral directors from all
parts of the country whose local crematorium is unable to cremate
large coffins," said spokesman Tim Morris.


"The likelihood is that a large number of facilities will be
upgraded to meet these requirements, with some taking this
opportunity to install a larger cremator at this time."


About 430,000 people are cremated in Britain each year.


"By upgrading their crematoria and widening furnaces, councils
are changing the services people use for the better, to make sure
that relatives are not put out," Harding added.
