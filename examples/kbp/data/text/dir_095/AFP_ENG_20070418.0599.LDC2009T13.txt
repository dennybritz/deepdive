Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that
he would announce his party's nomination for upcoming
presidential elections next week.


"I will announce it on the day when my party holds its
parliamentary group meeting," Erdogan told reporters, adding that
this would be either next Tuesday or Wednesday.


The ten-day period to register presidential candidates ends at
midnight next Wednesday.


Erdogan, a conservative with an Islamist political past, did not
say whether he would run for the post himself, a prospect that
has struck at the heart of this Muslim country's secular
identity.


The prime minister was speaking after an eight-hour meeting of
the executive board of his Justice and Development Party (AKP)
which gave him full authority to decide on who their presidential
candidate should be.


Although Erdogan says he has disowned his Islamist past and now
describes himself as a "conservative democract," opponents
suspect he still has a hidden Islamist agenda.


Some 500,000 people rallied in Ankara over the weekend to urge
him to back off on any presidential ambitions.
