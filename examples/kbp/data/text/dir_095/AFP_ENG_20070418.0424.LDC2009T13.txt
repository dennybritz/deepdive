Oman said on Wednesday it had inaugurated the second oil refinery
in the sultanate along with a polypropylene plant at a total cost
of 1.61 billion dollars.


The refinery, at Sohar on the northeast coast, took an investment
of 1.3 billion dollars and has a production capacity of 116,400
barrels per day, said Ahmed Ben Mohammed Haddabi, interim
president of Sohar Refinery, quoted by the official ONA news
agency.


The company plans to export 80 percent of the refinery output and
channel the rest to the local market, he added.


The polypropylene plant, built near the refinery at a cost of 312
million dollars, started production late in 2006. It has an
annual capacity of 340,000 tonnes of the synthetic resin,
according to the plant's deputy president.
