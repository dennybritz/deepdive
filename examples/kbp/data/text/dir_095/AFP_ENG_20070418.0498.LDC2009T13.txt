England fast bowler Simon Jones has told critics to give Andrew
Flintoff a break after the star all-rounder came under fire
following the team's dismal World Cup.


England crashed out of the Caribbean showpiece on Tuesday when
they were humiliated by nine wickets by South Africa in a match
which was so one-sided that the Proteas had victory wrapped up
with 30 overs to spare.


But Jones believes that Flintoff, who starred alongside him in
the 2005 Ashes series, should not be singled out.


"He's looked a bit out of form but it happens, you can't be good
all the time can you?" Jones told the BBC.


"Fred (Flintoff) is such a key player that if he's not playing
well then the whole team suffers."


Jones missed the World Cup through injury but is desperate to
reclaim his place in the England team ahead of the summer Test
series against the touring West Indies.


"I don't know what to make of it (the World Cup defeat) because I
wasn't there, but England do need Fred firing on all cylinders if
they're going to succeed," said Jones.


"He had a super 2005 (Ashes) series, he was probably the world's
best all- rounder then but you do get a dip in form sometimes.


"I'm sure he'll be working as hard as he can in the nets, working
on his fitness and he'll be back, don't worry about it."
