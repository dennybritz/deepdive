The United States and Britain will begin talks at the UN Security
Council Thursday on a resolution on Darfur, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday, calling the situation "a scandal."


"Tomorrow the United States and the United Kingdom are going to
begin discussions with others in the Security Council on a new
United Nations Security Council resolution on Sudan," he said.


"What is happening in Sudan at the moment is unacceptable, it is
appalling and it is a scandal for the international community,"
he added, speaking to reporters at his Downing Street office.
