Russian gas giant Gazprom on Wednesday took control of the huge
Sakhalin-2 liquified gas project from Royal Dutch Shell and two
Japanese groups for 7.45 billion dollars, the four companies
announced.


An agreement on the acquisition was signed by the parties in
Moscow on December 21 last year.


"Under its terms Gazprom acquires a 50 percent plus one share
stake in Sakhalin Energy (the project operator) for 7.45 billion
dollars in cash," the companies said in a joint statement.


"The other three shareholders, Shell, (Japanese groups) Mitsui
and Mitsubishi each dilute their stakes by 50 percent to receive
a proportional share of the purchase price."


The project is located in Russia's fareast and, with total
investment of nearly 22 billion dollars (16.6 billion euros), is
considered the largest ever private investment venture.


Starting in the summer of 2008, Sakhalin-2 will enable the
shipment of liquified natural gas by sea from Sakhalin Island,
notably to the Japanese market.


The agreement in December giving Gazprom control of Sakhalin-2
came after months of pressure by Russian authorities who had
accused Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi of having violated
environmental regulations.


The Russian energy ministry meanwhile announced Wednesday that
Sakhalin Energy would nearly double the budget for the second
phase of development to 19.4 billion dollars.
