A car bomb near a central Baghdad market killed at least 115
people Wednesday, a security official said, bringing to 160 the
death toll from a spate of bombings in the capital.


The explosives-rigged car blew up in the Al-Sadriyah district,
home to a mixed Kurdish and Shiite population.


The official said another 137 people were wounded, with women and
children among the casualties.


Another security official with the defence ministry put the death
toll at 112 with 115 wounded, although a medic at the capital's
Al-Kindi hospital said doctors there had received 69 bodies
alone.


Markets are a frequent target for bombings by Sunni extremists
bent on slaughtering Shiites, the majority community in Iraq
which now heads the government and dominates the security forces.


The bombings have continued despite a massive security crackdown
launched more than two months ago that has seen tens of thousands
of Iraqi and US troops patrolling the capital's streets.
