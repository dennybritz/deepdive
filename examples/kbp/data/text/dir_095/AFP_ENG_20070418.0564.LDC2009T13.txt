Francesco Totti fired a late double to hand champions-in-waiting
Inter Milan their first defeat of the season in the match which
was supposed to signal their Serie A title celebrations
Wednesday.


Totti's late freekick from the edge of the area was deflected by
an Inter boot and handed the visitors a late lead after Marco
Materazzi's spot kick had equalised Simone Perrotta's 44th minute
opener for Roma.


Totti then found time and space as he charged towards the Inter
goal in the dying seconds to beat Inter keeper Julio Cesar with a
well struck shot which stunned the hosts.


It is Inter's first defeat in 32 matches this season and means
they will now have to wait before celebrating a certain league
title.


With six matches remaining Inter lead second-placed Roma by 13
points.
