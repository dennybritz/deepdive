the final with Australia."

they can do so after every match."

England gave the Proteas in a place in the semi-finals. Graeme

"It was another pathetic batting performance by an England team
who have been far and away the most anaemic of the tournament."

South Africa.


"I won't be retiring from one-day cricket. I am not stupid."

thrill."
