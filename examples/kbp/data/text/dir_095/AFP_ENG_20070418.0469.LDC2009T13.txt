Russia's lower house of parliament passed a law Wednesday that
would increase penalties for racist attacks and use of neo-Nazi
paraphernalia.


The law, which must also be approved by the upper house and
signed by President Vladimir Putin, was introduced by government
to counter what it said was a "sharp increase in activity by
extremist youth groups."


The government said it was targeting groups ranging from Slavic
nationalists and skinheads to the more politicised radical youth
organisation known as the National Bolsheviks, one of the few
vocal anti-Kremlin opposition movements in the country.


The lower house of parliament, or State Duma, voted unanimously
to pass a third reading of the law, which would impose prison
sentences of up to three years for vandalism involving "motives
of ideological, racial, ethnic or religious hatred."


Vandalism against cemeteries would be punished by up to five
years in prison, instead of three as currently.


Fines equivalent to between 30 and almost 3,000 euros (41-4,074
dollars) would be imposed for the production, distribution, or
purchase of uniforms or other symbols resembling those of Nazi
Germany.


Racist crimes are common in Russia, with regular violent attacks
against ethnic minorities and foreign non-white visitors.


According to Sova, a non-governmental organisation monitoring
such abuses, racist attacks rose 17 percent in 2006 over the
previous year, including 54 murders.
