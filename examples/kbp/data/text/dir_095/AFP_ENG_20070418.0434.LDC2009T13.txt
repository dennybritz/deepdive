Britain is known the world over for its love of afternoon tea --
and The Dorchester hotel was named Wednesday as the best place in
London to indulge.


The Dorchester beat last year's winner Claridge's hotel to the
United Kingdom Tea Council's sought-after Top London Afternoon
Tea award.


"The sumptuous elegance of The Promenade at The Dorchester sets a
perfect theme for a very special afternoon tea," said Irene
Gorman, head of the Tea Guild, part of the council, which runs
the annual award.


Afternoon tea at The Dorchester costs 29.50 pounds (59 dollars,
43.50 euros) and includes finger sandwiches, scones, French
pastries and hot drinks.


The super-deluxe "high tea" version at 43 pounds comes with a
glass of champagne, savoury food, pastries and hot drinks.


The hotel was praised for its "attentive yet discreet" service.


Under-cover inspectors judged tea rooms around the British
capital on their range and quality of teas, decor, atmosphere and
value for money.


The Dorchester is on Park Lane, a road lined with luxurious
hotels overlooking Hyde Park.


"We are delighted to have won for 2007," said Zoe Jenkins, the
hotel's food and beverage manager.


"This is the third time The Dorchester has won this award since
2000 and we are the only London hotel to have achieved this.


"It is a reflection of just how popular tea at The Dorchester is
with both hotel guests and visitors alike."
