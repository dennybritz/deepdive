Former Tuareg rebels in Mali are supporting incumbent President
Amadou Toumani Toure in elections later this month, a rebel
leader said Wednesday.


Iyad Ag Ghali told AFP the ex-rebels, who have signed a peace
deal with the government, will support Toure "because of the
positive role that he played to return peace after the events
that occurred here in our region."


Ghali's comments came a day after the president visited the
northeastern city of Kidal, in the region where the rebels are
located. The election is scheduled for April 29.


Tuareg rebels raided two military camps last year in the
northeast, taking away arms and ammunition, then holed up in an
area near the border with Algeria.


The attacks prompted fears of a return to the violence that
plagued the area in the early 1990s. But the rebels signed an
agreement with the government two months later.


Under the deal, rebels agreed to no longer claim autonomy for
their homelands in northern parts of Mali, while Bamako said it
would speed up the development of the Sahara desert region.


Rebels returned to Kidal last month and turned in weapons that
they had taken in the raids.


Toure, elected in 2002, faces seven challengers in his bid for
re-election. He is supported by 44 parties that are part of a
coalition called the Alliance for Democracy and Progress.
