A French doctor has been arrested in Italy for smuggling and
selling slimming pills laced with amphetamines, police said
Wednesday.


Jean-Marie Soumeire, who lives in Switzerland, was arrested on
Tuesday in Milan along with his wife Christiane Arzouni, who is
also a doctor, a police official said.


"This case is serious not only because drugs are being brought
into Italy and can endanger the health of patients but also
because it involves duping dieticians as well as tax fraud,"
Virgilio Pomponi, an official tracking fiscal offences, told La
Stampa newspaper.


The couple, who live in Montreux, are also accused of smuggling
and selling illegal medicines. The police have seized about
37,000 pills.


Pills sold to 70 patients earned the couple an estimated 100,000
euros (135,000 dollars), the daily said, adding that the total
number of patients could well be 200.


Many of the patients reported health problems after taking the
slimming pills, Pomponi said.


The company exporting the pills is based in Saint George in
Switzerland and is registered in the name of the doctor's wife.


The doctor charged patients 260 euros for the first consultation
and a fee of 200 euros for each subsequent visit, not including
the cost of the medication.
