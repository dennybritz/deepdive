Ireland were 34-3 after 10 overs against Sri Lanka in both teams'
final World Cup Super Eights match at the Grenada National
Stadium here Wednesday.


William Porterfield was on 10 with Niall O'Brien on one.


Ireland enjoyed a good start reaching 28-1 by the eighth over
before left-arm seamer Farveez Maharoof removed Jeremy Bray for
20 and then Andre Botha (0) and Eoin Morgan (0) in successive
balls with both players falling to catches by Kumar Sangakkara.


Sri Lanka are already through to the semi-finals while Ireland,
seventh in the table, are now unable to get a place in the last
four.


Bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan, controversially
rested for Sri Lanka's seven-wicket defeat by world champions
Australia here Monday, returned.


Pace bowler Nuwan Kulasekara retained his place with fellow quick
Dilhara Fernando dropping out. Leg-spinner Malinga Bandara, a
World Cup debutant against Australia, made way for Muralitharan.


Fast bowler Lasith Malinga missed his third straight game after
injuring left ankle ligaments in training.


Ireland, who stunned the cricket world in the first round by
defeating Pakistan, made one change from the side that beat
fellow surprise package Bangladesh by 74 runs in Barbados on
Sunday.


Postman Kenny Carroll, a top order batsman and slow left-arm
bowler, replaced Andrew White.


Victory for Sri Lanka would see them avoid both finishing fourth
and a likely meeting with Australia in the semi-finals.
