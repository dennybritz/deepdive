Morocco is facing an "extreme" threat of more terror attacks in
Casablanca and other cities following a spate of suicide
bombings, a government spokesman said Wednesday.


"Morocco is in a state of extreme alert and this situation
prevails as much in Casablanca as in other cities and sensitive
zones in the country," said spokesman and Communications Minister
Nabil Benbdellah.


"Terrorism can strike any time."


Speaking after a government meeting here to discuss the terror
threat, he said security had been tightened around consulates,
hotels used by foreigners and in religious places in Casablanca.


Some 20 people have been arrested in relation to last week's
suicide bombings in the port city.


Six militants died there last week as police investigated a March
11 explosion in a Internet cafe.


Three men blew themselves up as they were pursued by police last
Tuesday and a fourth would-be bomber was shot dead by police.


On Saturday two brothers blew themselves up near the US consulate
and near an American language school in Casablanca.


The attacks last week in Morocco and in neighbouring Algeria,
where 30 people died in three suicide attacks, have sparked fears
that the recent violence presages an upsurge in Islamist violence
in the region.
