Hungary's public deficit was 9.2 percent of gross domestic
product in 2006, down from the 10.1 percent forecast, Finance
Minister Janos Veres told a press conference Wednesday in
Budapest.


Veres said the government had also lowered the 2007 deficit
forecast by 0.1 percent of GDP for a second time this year, to
6.6 percent of GDP from the original 6.8 percent.


"The government lowered its public deficit forecast to 6.6
percent of GDP from the earlier 6.8 percent and modified last
year's to 9.2 percent from the previously stated 10.1 percent of
GDP," Veres said.


The better-than-expected pace of deficit reduction is attributed
to Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany's austerity
measures, which include tax hikes, cuts in household energy price
subsidies as well as the introduction of co- payments for
doctor's visits and university tuition fees.


Gyurcsany's Socialist-Liberal coalition, which was re-elected
last year, has seen its popularity plummet as the result of these
measures.


But they are also considered a crucial part of the country's
efforts to meet economic criteria to adopt the euro, which
include bringing the deficit under 3.0 percent of GDP.


The government has no target date for adopting the euro but
analysts expect this to happen between 2011 and 2014.
