The gunman who killed at least 30 people at a US university this
week was briefly taken to a mental health facility out of
concerns he was suicidal in late 2005, police said Wednesday.


An acquaintance of Cho Seung-Hui, "concerned that Cho might be
suicidal," called police in late 2005 after the Virginia Tech
student was investigated for allegedly stalking female students,
said university police chief Wendell Flinchum.


Police asked him to see a counselor, and Cho was later "taken to
a mental health facility," Flinchum told reporters.


He did not know whether the 23-year-old South Korean student, who
killed himself after Monday's shooting rampage at Virginia Tech
University, was taken there voluntarily or involuntarily.


Campus police said that they had contact with Cho in 2005 after
two women complained that he had been stalking them, but did not
file charges against him.


Flinchum said that the women were not among the dead.


"Neither one of them are among victims," he said.


Campus counselors said they did know whether Cho had been treated
by university mental health professionals, but if they had found
him to be any danger to others, they would have had to warn the
university.


"If there is a danger, we are required to warn," said Chris
Flynn, director of the counseling center.


Cho's mental state was not considered when he purchased the two
handguns believed to have been the weapons used in the shootings.


"No record on the firearm check said that he had anything that
prohibited him from purchasing a gun," Flinchum told reporters.


Cho killed at least 30 students and teachers in a classroom
building Monday and is suspected of having killed two other
students in another campus building about two hours earlier.
