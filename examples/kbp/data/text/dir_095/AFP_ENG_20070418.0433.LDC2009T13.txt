The gunman who killed at least 30 people at a US university this
week was briefly taken to a mental health facility out of
concerns he was suicidal in late 2005, police said Wednesday.


"He was taken to St Albans outside Radford," Virginia, Virginia
Tech police chief Wendell Flinchum told reporters.


He did not know whether Cho, who killed himself after Monday's
shooting rampage, was taken there voluntarly or involuntarily.
