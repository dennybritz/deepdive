A British civil servant leaked a secret memo detailing talks on
Iraq policy between Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President
George W. Bush, a court in London heard Wednesday.


David Keogh handed the document to his friend Leo O'Connor, who
worked for a lawmaker, because he wanted its contents to be made
public, prosecutor David Perry told the Old Bailey criminal
court.


Keogh, a government communications officer who joined the civil
service in 1979, was on duty when the memo came through on a
secure fax machine and copied it "in order to disclose its
contents," Perry said.


The talks between Blair and Bush detailed in the memo took place
in Washington in April 2004 in the run-up to a handover of power
to Iraqis by the coalition authority.


The memo itself -- written on headed notepaper from Blair's
Downing Street office -- has not been read out in open court, and
parts of the trial are set to be held behind closed doors due to
the sensitivity of the material involved.


Keogh, 50, and O'Connor, 44, who are both from Northampton,
central England, have been charged under Britain's Official
Secrets Act.


Keogh is facing two charges of making a damaging disclosure of
part of government document without lawful authority, while
O'Connor has been charged with making a damaging disclosure of a
document passed to him illegally. They have denied the charges.
