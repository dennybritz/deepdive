A "stalled" situation in Lebanon is hampering efforts to check
arms smuggling across the border with Syria, Italian Foreign
Minister Massimo D'Alema said Wednesday.


D'Alema said that in talks with visiting UN Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon the two discussed their "concerns over the stalled
situation from the political- institutional point of view and the
resulting difficulties in fulfilling various initiatives."


Principal among these is "control of cross-border arms
trafficking," he told a joint news conference after the talks.


The UN Security Council on Tuesday asked Ban, who will visit
Syria next Monday, to send an independent mission to investigate
reports of illegal arms movements across the Lebanese-Syrian
border.


Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 34-day war
between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon last
August, called for the prevention of illegal arms sales and
smuggling operations in Lebanon.


D'Alema noted that Rome has a "special responsibility" in
Lebanon, where Italian General Claudio Graziano commands the UN
Interim Force in Lebanon.


He also urged "a political initiative to reach an accord between
the political forces ... on the international tribunal on the
assassination of (former Lebanese prime minister) Rafik Hariri."
