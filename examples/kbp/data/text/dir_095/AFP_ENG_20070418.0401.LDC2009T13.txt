Qatar's Aspire Academy on Wednesday announced a wide-ranging
programme to identify and train top footballing talent from seven
African countries.


"Aspire Africa. Football Dreams" was unveiled at a ceremony in
the Qatari capital attended by legendary Brazilian star Pele.


Starting in late May, 6,000 staff will screen more than 500,000
boys born in 1994 in seven different countries -- Algeria,
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa.


In the first phase, the best 50 players from each country,
identified in the selection process, will go for a week of trials
in the capital city of their respective nations.


The top three from each country will then go to the Aspire
academy in Doha for four weeks of trials and testing. Following a
period of assessment and discussions with the families, the most
talented players will be enrolled into the Academy.


Andreas Bleicher, Sports Director at Aspire Andreas Bleicher
said: "This is an incredible opportunity for talented young
African boys to reach the heights of international football in
the future.


"Everyone in football is aware of the significant talent that
exists in Africa, and also of the challenges that can prevent
this talent reaching its full potential."


The state-of-the-art Aspire Academy is the largest indoor sports
arena in the world. Its main aim is to identify, educate and
train talented athletes to compete in professional sports at the
highest levels.
