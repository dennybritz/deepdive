UN chief Ban Ki-moon met with Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday for
the first time since the South Korean took charge of the world
body.


The two men held closed-door talks for about 20 minutes in the
pontiff's library and the discussions were held in English, a
Vatican statement said, adding that Ban had been warmly recieved
by the pope.


Ban arrived in Rome on Tuesday where he met President Giorgio
Napolitano and Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema. He goes on to
Switzerland for his first official visit to the Alpine nation and
then on to Qatar and Syria.
