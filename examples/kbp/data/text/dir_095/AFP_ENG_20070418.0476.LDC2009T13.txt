Two German public TV stations have protested to Russian President
Vladimir Putin about the violent treatment of their
correspondents when Russian police broke up an opposition rally
at the weekend.


In a joint letter to Putin released on Wednesday, ARD and ZDF
said they were "greatly concerned" that their correspondents had
been intimidated and "arbitrarily arrested" by riot police as
they covered the opposition rally in Saint Petersburg on Sunday.


"We urgently demand an end to all attempts at intimidating
journalists, either foreign or Russian," said the letter.


"When the security forces in your country abuse the right to free
reporting in such a way, it damages the international reputation
of Russia."


The letter was signed by ARD chairman Fritz Raff and ZDF director
Markus Schaechter.


Russian police clubbed and detained opposition protestors in
Saint Petersburg after the peaceful demonstration organised by
The Other Russia, an opposition coalition that accuses Putin of
dismantling democracy.


An anti-Putin demonstration in Moscow on Saturday also resulted
in mass arrests.


The European Union and the United States have condemned the
action of the Russian police.
