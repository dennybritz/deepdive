Joyful Ukrainians temporarily set aside an intense political
crisis Wednesday to celebrate being selected as joint host for
the Euro 2012 football championships.


The ex-Soviet republic, which lies between Russia and the
European Union, was a surprise choice by European football's
governing body UEFA, to host the tournament along with
neighbouring Poland.


"I am happy that Ukraine and Poland have won the competition,"
President Viktor Yushchenko said in a statement. "All Ukrainians
are joyful about this excellent piece of news."


Government ministers broke into "wild applause" when the news was
announced at a cabinet meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Mykola
Azarov said, Interfax news agency reported.


A power struggle between Yushchenko and his government is
currently paralysing politics in Ukraine.


Perhaps watching the UEFA decision closer than anyone was Andri
Sadovy, mayor of Lviv, a nationalist bastion near the border with
Poland and a future site for EURO-2012 matches.


Sadovy waited for the decision to be announced, watching on
television in a Lviv cafe, and at the moment of triumph leapt up
in celebration.


He then began opening beer bottles and pouring drinks to others
in the cafe, an AFP correspondent saw. "We will see a new Lviv,"
the mayor said.


The decision, announced by new UEFA president Michel Platini, was
a huge shock as world champions Italy had been hot favourites,
while the Polish/Ukraine bid was seen as the rank outsider.
