Three people, one of them believed to be a German, were found
with their throats slit at a Christian publishing house in
eastern Turkey, officials said on Wednesday.


Two of the victims -- all of whom had their hands and feet tied
-- were found dead in the offices of a publishing house that
printed books on Christianity. The third died in hosptial.


Two of the dead were reportedly employees of the publishing
house.


"One of them is highly likely to be a German, the other is
believed to be a Turk. The third is also likely to be a Turk, but
we still have doubts," the Governor of the eastern city of
Matalya, Halil Ibrahim Dasoz, told the NTV news channel.


An aide to the governor told AFP that the Zirve publishing house
"was engaged in missionary activities."


The company had earlier received threats for printing books on
Christianity, which were widely reported in the local press, NTV
said.


Police detained four suspects at the crime scene, Dasoz said,
adding that a fifth man, who was hospitalised after jumping from
the window of the office, was also considered to be a suspect.


The chief physician of a local hospital said the man who jumped
was in a "serious condition".


Dasoz said the publishing house had not asked for any special
protection from the police.
