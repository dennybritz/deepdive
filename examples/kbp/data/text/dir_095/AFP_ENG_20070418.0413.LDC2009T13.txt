The South Korean student who shot dead at least 30 people at
Virginia Tech University here on Monday was investigated in late
2005 for allegedly stalking female students, police said
Wednesday.


Virginia Tech police chief Wendell Flinchum told reporters that
two female students had complained to campus police about the
behavior of Cho Seung-Hui, 23, who committed suicide after
Monday's rampage.


Flinchum said the students declined to press charges but Cho was
referred to the university disciplinary system.
