Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that
he would announce his party's nomination for upcoming
presidential elections next week.


"I will announce it on the day when my party holds its
parliamentary group meeting," Erdogan told reporters, adding that
this would be either next Tuesday or Wednesday.


Erdogan, a conservative with an Islamist political past, did not
say whether he would run for the post himself, a prospect that
has struck at the heart of this Muslim country's secular
identity.
