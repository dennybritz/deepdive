France holds the first round of its presidential election on
Sunday, April 22 and AFP will provide comprehensive, up-to-the-
minute text, photo, video and graphics coverage of the end of the
campaign, voting day and the results.


We will move a main preview for morning advisories on Thursday,
April 19 along with our series of background stories on the 2007
election.


Editors should note that the official campaign ends at 2200 GMT
on Friday, April 20 and it is illegal to publish opinion polls on
the presidential election in France after that time.


On voting day, we will file a main holding story by 0100 GMT.
Polling stations open at 0600 GMT and we will file regular main
bars, colour sidebars from key areas and comments by the main
candidates throughout the day until stations close at 1800 GMT.


First estimates will be given as soon as polling stations close
and we will file spot analysis, reactions and profiles of the two
candidates that go through to the second round on May 6 as well
as regular mainbar roundups through the night.


More detail on our individual stories can be found on our daily
news advisories. For any queries please contact AFP at:
