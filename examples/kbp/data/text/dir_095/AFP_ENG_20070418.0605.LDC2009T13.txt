Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo extended Wednesday till May
29 the six- month state of emergency his government had imposed
in the southwestern state of Ekiti.


The situation in Ekiti "could snowball into a complete state of
anarchy and lawlessness that could spread to neighbouring
states," he said in a nationwide television broadcast.


His decision follows widespread violence across Nigeria following
last weekend's local elections and ahead of Saturday's
presidential polls.
