Research in Motion Ltd. said Wednesday a network outage overnight
had stunted its hugely popular wireless Blackberry e-mail
service, but messaging to "most" of its handsets had been
restored.


"A service interruption occurred Tuesday night that affected
BlackBerry in North America. E-mail delivery was delayed or
intermittent during the service interruption," the Waterloo,
Ontario-based company said in a statement.


"Phone service on BlackBerry handsets was unaffected."


"The root cause is currently under review, but service for most
customers was restored overnight and RIM is closely monitoring
systems in order to maintain normal service levels."


Research in Motion is the market leader for mobile e-mail devices
with more than seven million users of its BlackBerry worldwide.


Technology analyst Jeff Kagan commented: "The rapid subscriber
growth, plus the runaway junk e-mail boom, equals a disaster in
the making. Networks work fine until they reach their capacity,
then all sorts of strange things happen."


"This is a sampling of the chaos we could be working through if
we have a meltdown of our networks, or a terrorist attack.
Terrorists could cause so much more damage breaking our
networks," Kagan added.


Kagan also predicted that Research in Motion would "take a hit"
because of this glitch, but added Blackberry users would
"probably come back because the users are almost rabid."
