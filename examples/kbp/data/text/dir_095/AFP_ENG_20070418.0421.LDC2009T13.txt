The South Korean student who shot dead at least 30 people at
Virginia Tech University here on Monday was investigated in late
2005 for allegedly stalking female students, police said
Wednesday.


Virginia Tech police chief Wendell Flinchum told reporters that
two female students had complained to campus police about the
behavior of Cho Seung-Hui, 23, who committed suicide after
Monday's rampage.


Flinchum said the students declined to press charges but Cho was
referred to the university disciplinary system.


"We did have contact with Cho in the fall of 2005," the campus
police chief told a press conference. "In November of 2005, Cho
had made contact through phone calls and in person with a female
student.


"The student notified the Virginia Tech police department and
officers responded," he said. "The student declined to press
charges, aplinary system which is the office of judicial
affairs," he said.


Flinchum said the second incident occurred in December 2005.


"Cho instant messaged a second female student," he said. "Again
no threat was made against that student. However, she made a
complaint to the Virginia Tech police department and asked that
Cho have no further contact with her.


"Officers followed up the next morning and spoke with Cho
concerning this matter," he said.
