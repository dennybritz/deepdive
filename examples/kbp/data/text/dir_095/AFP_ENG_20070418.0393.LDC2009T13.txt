Challengers to Alinghi's America's Cup crown were foiled by the
conditions again here Wednesday when the absence of any breeze of
substance forced organisers to cancel the Louis Vuitton Cup for
the third day in succession.


The stage was set, the actors poised, the boats prepared, the
starting gun polished - the only ingredient missing for racing to
go ahead in this America's Cup qualifying competition was the
wind.


The 10-race programme featuring Emirates Team New Zealand up
against home side Desafio Espanol which had been due to start at
1420 (1220GMT) was officially called off at 1600 (1400GMT).


So like on Monday and Tuesday the 11 crews, spectators and
assembled media were left twiddling their thumbs on and off
Valencia's Port America's Cup in frustration at the lack of
action.


The winner of the two month long competition goes on to meet
Alinghi in a best of nine match series for the 32nd America's Cup
from June 23.
