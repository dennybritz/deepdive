British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett condemned as
"appalling" car bomb attacks which killed 160 people in Baghdad
Wednesday, saying they will only bolster international resolve.


"This latest carnage in Baghdad is another appalling example of
the lengths to which those who offer only death and destruction
will go to in trying to undermine democracy in Iraq," she said in
a statement released by her office.


"Such acts only strengthen our determination to continue to
support the people and government of Iraq and underline the
importance of the reconciliation process."
