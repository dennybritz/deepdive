UN chief Ban Ki-moon met with Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday for
the first time since the South Korean took charge of the world
body and invited the pontiff to visit its New York headquarters.


"Mr Ban Ki-moon had wanted to meet the Holy Father during the
course of his his first tours of Africa, Europe and the Middle
East just a few months after taking charge on January 1," a
Vatican statement said.


It said Ban also expressly "invited the pope to visit the UN
headquarters."


The two men held closed-door talks for about 20 minutes in the
pontiff's library and the discussions were held in English, it
said, adding that Ban had been warmly recieved by the pope.


They discussed a slew of issues of "common interest" -- ranging
from multilateralism, reinforcing dialogue between diverse
cultures and the role the Roman Catholic Church can play in
helping the UN to resolve conflicts."


Ban arrived in Rome on Tuesday where he met President Giorgio
Napolitano and Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema. He goes on to
Switzerland for his first official visit to the Alpine nation and
then on to Qatar and Syria.
