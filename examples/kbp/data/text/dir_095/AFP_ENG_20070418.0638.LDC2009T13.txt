Eritrean President Issaias Afeworki on Wednesday named Osman
Saleh as the country's new foreign minister, a task that will see
him handle ties with the world and southern rival Ethiopia.


The foreign ministry portfolio has been unoccupied since the
death of Ali Said Abdella in August 2005.


"The president has assigned minister Osman Saleh to serve as the
minister of foreign affairs," Eritrean information minister Ali
Abdu told AFP by phone. Saleh moves to the post from the
education portfolio.


Osman takes over the ministry as the tiny Red Sea country is
facing accusations of supporting Somali Islamist insurgents in
battling joint Ethiopian and Somalia forces in the capital
Mogadishu.


Asmara vehemently denies these claims, but insists that the
presence of Ethiopian troops and African Union peacekeepers in
Somalia will worsen the already-volatile security climate.


Osman will be tasked with handling relations with neighbouring
Ethiopia, which have been uneasy since a bloody 1998-2000 war
that claimed at least 70,000 lives.


An international boundary commission established at the end of
the conflict awarded the flashpoint town of Badme to Eritrea. But
Ethiopia, which rejects the boundary, said the commission was
acting outside its mandate.
