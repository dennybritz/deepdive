The US Supreme Court retrenched access to abortion for the first
time in more than a generation Wednesday, upholding a 2003
federal law restricting access to a rare but controversial late-
term abortion procedure.


The ruling is a major victory for conservative forces in the
United States, which have battled for decades to reverse the
landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade law establishing a woman's legal right
to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
