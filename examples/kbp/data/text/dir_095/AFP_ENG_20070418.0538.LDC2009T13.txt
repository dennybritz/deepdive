Two big British labor syndicates and a North American guild
announced steps Wednesday to create the first transatlantic trade
union to help workers get "an equal footing" with globalized
companies.


Amicus, the Transport and General Workers Union (T&GWU) and
the United Steel Workers (USW) of America announced the beginning
of "a formal process" to merge the labor groups and forge "the
world's biggest union."


"The new union would represent over 3.4 million members in the
US, Canada, UK and Ireland," said a statement issued by the
groups.


"It would be the world's biggest union and would be expected to
attract other union organizations throughout the world into
membership."


"One of the main reasons for the merger between Amicus and the
T&GWU, was our desire to create an international trade union
that would be able to deal with multinational companies on an
equal footing and organize working people in ever-greater
numbers," said Amicus general secretary Derek Simpson.


Simpson said the action "demonstrates the resonance that the idea
of a global superunion with an organizing agenda has throughout
the international trade union movement."


The announcement was made in Ottawa with USW president Leo
Gerard.


Amicus is already finalizing a merger with the T&GWU in
Britain to be called Unite, and will include some 2.1 million
members. The USW represents about 1.2 million active and retired
members in the United States and Canada.


The aim of the merger is to create "greater international
solidarity and cooperation to better represent workers against
the threats posed by global capital," the unions said in a
statement.


T&GWU general secretary Tony Woodley said in a statement:
"This is an historic step for global trade unionism, and will
help working people to look even the biggest employer in the
eye."
