While investors were tough on Yahoo's stock on Wednesday the
Internet giant announced it will go easy on the planet by going
carbon neutral.


The Sunnyvale, California-based online search engine will offset
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its energy use by
investing in environmental projects worldwide, said Yahoo co-
founder David Filo.


Filo estimated that Yahoo going "carbon neutral" will cut air
pollution as much as would result from turning off the
electricity to all San Francisco homes for a month or removing
25,000 cars from the streets for a year.


"We know carbon neutrality isn't without controversy," Filo said
in a statement.


"We think our offset program counts, but since this is a new and
emerging market, we expect to learn as we go."


Yahoo's stock price was down nearly 12 percent on Wednesday to
28.32 dollars in the wake of a first-quarter earnings report
showing the Internet pioneer's profits sagged 11 percent under
the weight of operating expenses.
