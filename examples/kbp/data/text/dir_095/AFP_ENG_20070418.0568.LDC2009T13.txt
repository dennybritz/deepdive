David Beckham returned to group training with his Real Madrid
teammates on Wednesday for the first time since he injured a
ligament in his right knee in a game against Getafe on March 4.


"The English star has finally recovered from the sprain to his
right knee he got against Getafe in early March," the club said
on its website.


The former England captain, who has been training on his own
since April 3, did not experience any problems, it added.


Real would not comment on whether they expect Beckham to be fit
for Saturday's crucial league match at home against Valencia.


The nine-time European champions are five points adrift of
leaders Barcelona in the domestic title race with just eight
matches left.


The Spanish league title is Beckham's last chance to win a major
trophy with Real before he joins the Los Angeles Galaxy in
August, after going empty-handed since coming to the Spanish
capital in 2003 from Manchester United.
