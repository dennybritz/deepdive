German league leaders Schalke 04 said Sunday that Danish forward
Peter Lovenkrands could miss their crucial title run-in.


The former Rangers player was carried off on a stretcher during
Schalke's 2-0 loss at Bayern Munich on Saturday.


The 27-year-old injured his heel in his first match back after
spending six weeks on the sidelines with the same problem.


"He will undergo scans on Monday and will be in plaster while
waiting," said a club statement.


Despite the defeat Schalke retained their lead in the
championship, a two point advantage over Werder Bremen with seven
matches remaining.
