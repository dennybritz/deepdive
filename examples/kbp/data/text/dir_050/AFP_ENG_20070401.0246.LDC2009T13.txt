Sixteen suspected members of the Tamil Tigers rebel group were
detained Sunday in Paris during an investigation into terrorist
financing activities, sources close to the case said.


Police made the arrests under the direction of anti-terrorist
judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, the sources said.


The suspects are alleged to be involved in extortion, violence
and detentions as part of fundraising activities for the rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who are fighting a separatist
war in Sri Lanka.


The Tigers were put on the EU terrorist list in May last year.
