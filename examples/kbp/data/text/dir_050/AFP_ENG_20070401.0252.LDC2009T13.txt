The German presidency of the European Union welcomed the
formation of a new interim government in Nepal Sunday including
former Maoist rebels and urged it to promote peace and democracy.


"The EU considers the promulgation of the interim constitution
and the formation of the interim parliament and government as
important milestones in the peace process in Nepal," the German
presidency said in a statement.


Berlin said the EU "looks to the new government to operate in
line with democratic principles" and "to restore law and order"
in the impoverished Himalayan nation which suffered a decade of
civil war.


Former Maoists rebels who signed a peace pact with the country's
mainstream parties in November were on Sunday sworn into a new
cabinet.


It must steer Nepal to elections on June 20 -- which will lead to
a decision on whether the country keeps its 238-year-old monarchy
or becomes a republic.


"The EU calls on all political forces in Nepal to demonstrate
their commitment to democratic values in order to allow free and
fair elections to take place," the statement said.


Nepal's King Gyanendra was forced to relinquish direct rule last
year after months of mass protests organised by an alliance of
the political parties and the Maoists.
