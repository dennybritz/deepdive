Not mentioning Francesco Totti when listing Roma's best players
is tantamount to treason in the Eternal City.


And Sir Alex Ferguson's exclusion of the exalted number 10 among
the players Manchester United most fear has added spice to
Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg here on
Wednesday.


Romans are up in arms that Ferguson, when asked which Roma
players he most admired, allegedly overlooked Totti and cited
midfielders Daniele De Rossi and Mancini as their key men.


And on Sunday, Totti had a stark warning for the Manchester
United manager.


"I accept Ferguson's opinion of me, and I hope to make sure he
remembers my name," Totti told Sky Sports Italia.


Totti also took a swipe at England and English football, saying
he has never been tempted to play in the Premiership.


"I've never liked English football, even though many great
players play there," said the 30-year-old Italian World Cup
winner.


"I don't like English football, and I don't like England where
the weather is miserable."
