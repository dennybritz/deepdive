Iran confirmed on Sunday that it was in direct talks with Britain
over 15 British naval personnel captured off Iraq, saying
contacts had never been cut.


"They were never cut and so there was no need to restart them,"
an Iranian official told AFP, speaking under condition of
anonymity.


"And the sign for this is that the two countries' foreign
ministries have been exchanging messages. Iran has never wanted
to close the diplomatic path, unless the British government
creates such conditions."


In an interview from Afghanistan earlier Sunday, British Defence
Secretary Des Browne said: "We are in direct bilateral
communication with the Iranians and they know that not only are
we in a very clear position but that we have the support of
almost all of the international community."
