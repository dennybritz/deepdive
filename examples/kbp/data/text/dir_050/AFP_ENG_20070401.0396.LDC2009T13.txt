Tenth seed Novak Djokovic defeated Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-2, 6-4
here Sunday in the final of the 6.9 million dollar ATP Miami
Masters Series event.


The 19-year-old Serbian became the first teenager to capture the
championship since 1990 when a 19-year-old Andre Agassi defeated
Stefan Edberg in the final.


It was the fourth career ATP title for Djokovic but the most
prestigious since he turned pro.


Djokovic clinched the win with a forehand winner on the first
championship point that froze Canas in his tracks.


He hammered six aces, converted four of seven break point
opportunities and had just one double fault in the two hour, 19
minute match.


Canas made Djokovic earn the championship as the longest game of
the match lasted 22 minutes. Canas also saved three set points
when he was down 5-2 in the second set before losing the 50
minute set 6-2.
