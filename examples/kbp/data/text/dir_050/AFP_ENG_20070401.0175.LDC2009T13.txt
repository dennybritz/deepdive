Suspected insurgents bombed a main railway line and four power
pylons in Pakistan's Baluchistan province, leaving hundreds of
thousands of people without electricity, officials said Sunday.


The provincial capital Quetta and 14 other districts were without
power since late Saturday after tribal rebels attacked the
pylons, said company official Naeem Akbar Shah said.


Repair teams had been sent to the site in Bolan district, some
150 kilometres (93 miles) southeast of Quetta, Shah said.


Separately insurgents blew up part of a main railway track with
explosives near Sibbi district late Saturday, but no trains were
passing at that time, a local police official said.


The track was repaired early Sunday and three trains stopped at
Sibbi railway station were allowed to continue their journeys,
the official said.


Security officials in Quetta said that they had received reports
of bomb blasts in Mastoong, Pasni and Panjgoor towns overnight,
but there were no casualties.


Rebels also fired 25 rockets on paramilitary forces in Tratani
village of the restive Kohlu district late Saturday, but there
were no casualties, they said.


The impoverished southwestern province has been wracked by an
insurgency since late 2004 when autonomy-seeking tribal rebels
fired rockets at the massive state-owned natural gas plant at
Sui.


The insurgents want a greater share of profits from the region's
rich resources and oppose President Pervez Musharraf's plan to
build several military bases in the province, which borders
Afghanistan and Iran.
