England coach Duncan Fletcher has warned his team of the unique
danger they will face from unorthodox Sri Lanka fast bowler
Lasith Malinga in Wednesday's World Cup clash.


Malinga, with his slingy action, became the first man to take
four wickets in four balls in his team's one-wicket Super Eights
defeat to South Africa last week.


"Malinga is a threat, he is unusual to any other bowler,"
Fletcher told a news conference on Sunday.


"Once you get out there and it hits you, it's completely
different to the talk. When you're under pressure, the way you
think is you always fall back on what you've done before. It's
hard to ask guys to suddenly change to something they haven't
really done consistently."


Sri Lanka, many peoples' favourites for the World Cup, crushed
England 5-0 in a one-day series last year.
