US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will tell Syrian officials during
an upcoming visit that Israel is ready to revive peace talks if
Damascus stops supporting "terrorism," an official said Sunday.


During talks between Pelosi and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert in Jerusalem on Sunday, Washington's top Democrat asked
what she could tell Syrian officials following her visit to
Israel.


"It should first of all stop supporting terrorism," Miri Eisin
quoted Olmert as telling the speaker. "We will be happy to talk
with it if it does so."


Peace talks between Israel and Syria collapsed in 2000 over the
parties' inability to agree on the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau that Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Six Day
War and subsequently annexed.


Pelosi is due to visit Syria this week as part of a regional tour
and to the ire of the White House, which accuses Damascus of
harbouring terror organisations and backing insurgents in Iraq.


Israel charges Syria and Iran with providing support to the
Islamist Hamas movement in Gaza and to the Hezbollah Shiite
movement in Lebanon with which it fought an inconclusive war last
summer.
