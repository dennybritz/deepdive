Iran urged US President George W. Bush Sunday to keep out of its
row with Britain over 15 sailors it detained for allegedly
entering Iranian waters illegally.


"It is better for the US president to refrain from making ill-
considered, non- technical and irrational comments," state
television quoted foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali
Hosseini as saying.


In an expression of support for Britain's efforts to secure the
release of its service personnel Saturday, Bush referred to the
15 as "hostages" to the anger of Iran.


"It's inexcusable behaviour and I strongly support the Blair
government's attempts to resolve this peacefully," he said.


"The Iranians must give back the hostages."
