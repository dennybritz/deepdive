Tens of thousands of worshippers crowded into St. Peter's
Basilica for Pope Benedict XVI's celebration of Palm Sunday mass.


The crowd was especially large with the mass occurring the day
before events planned for the second anniversary of the death of
the previous pope, John Paul II.


The service attended by about 40,000 began Sunday morning with
the procession of palms, which had been blessed by the pope.


Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week for Catholics and
signifies Jesus Christ's arrival in Jersualem.


Pope Benedict urged the faithful not to consider career and
financial gain as life's true aims, and instead to "consider
truth and love as authentic goals."


Thousands were expected to attend events Monday in conjunction
with the first phase of the beatification process for John Paul
II, a milestone on the path to sainthood.
