Azerbaijan will not allow its territory to be used in an attack
against its neighbours, the defence ministry said Sunday in what
appeared to be a reference to Iran.


The former Soviet republic is a key US ally in the Caucasus
region but also has close diplomatic and trade relations with
neighbouring Iran, a fellow Shiite Muslim country.


The defence ministry quoted US Deputy Secretary of State Matthew
Bryza as saying in neighbouring Georgia on Friday that the US
hopes to obtain the use of airfields in Azerbaijan for military
purposes.


"Azerbaijan, as a member of the anti-terrorist coalition, allows
the use of its airspace for conducting operations in
Afghanistan," the defence ministry said in a statement.


"But it must be noted that Azerbaijan will not create
opportunities or conditions allowing foreign countries to use its
territory against neighbouring countries."


The US is facing a mounting diplomatic confrontation with Iran
over its uranium enrichment and Western suspicions that Tehran is
bent on developing nuclear weapons.


Tensions have spiked since Iran's seizure on March 23 of 15
British marines and sailors.
