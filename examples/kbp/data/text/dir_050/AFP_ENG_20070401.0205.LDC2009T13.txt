A suicide attacker blew up his explosives-filled car near a
convoy of Afghan soldiers in eastern Afghanistan Sunday, killing
three children, provincial police said.


Three soldiers and four other locals were also wounded in the
attack in the province of Laghman, about 100 kilometres (60
miles) east of the Afghan capital of Kabul, the provincial police
criminal investigation chief said.


The blast was just north of the Laghman capital Mihtarlam near a
base of a provincial reconstruction team, Yar Mohammad Khan told
AFP.


The PRT in that province is run by US troops.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force confirmed
there had been an incident but had no details.


There have been nearly 30 suicide blasts in Afghanistan this
year, most of them carried out by the extremist Taliban movement
that has vowed a wave of such attacks as part of an insurgency.


There were 12 in January, three times higher than in the same
month in 2006, according to a UN Security Council report.


Insurgency-linked violence has claimed more than 900 lives this
year, according to an AFP tally based on reports. Most of the
dead have been rebels but they include about 120 civilians killed
in attacks or military action.
