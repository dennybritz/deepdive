British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said Sunday that she
held Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe "responsible" for
injuries to nine members of the opposition and strongly condemned
the attacks.


"I utterly condemn the beatings by the Zimbabwe police of those
who have been arrested on charges of treason. I hold Mugabe
responsible for their injuries," she said in a statement.


"This is further evidence of how low Mugabe will go in order to
cling onto power."


The injured, hospitalised Saturday after sustaining injuries
during a police crackdown in Harare last week, have since been
abducted from hospital, a lawyer for the main opposition Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) said Sunday.


"The guys were abducted last night from hospital around 2300 GMT
by state security agents," Alec Muchadehama said.


"They were taken from the wards without any hospital discharge
cards or anything to say they have been released.


"We understand the guys who took them were also accompanied by
prison officials."


A string of MDC officials and supporters were arrested last week
in what the authorities, which have not yet reacted to the
abduction claim, said was a crackdown on fire bombers accused of
a series of attacks across Zimbabwe.
