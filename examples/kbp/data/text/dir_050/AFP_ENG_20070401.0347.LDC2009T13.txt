US warplanes have violated Iranian airspace in the southwestern
oil-rich province of Khuzestan, Al-Alam Arabic language news
satellite channel quoted a local military chief as saying on
Sunday.


"Two US aircraft trespassed into Iranian airspace northwest of
(the southwestern port city of) Abadan before flying southwest
into Iraq," a local Revolutionary Guards commander in Abadan
identified only as Colonel Aqili was quoted as saying on the
channel's website.


"The planes left white vapour trails, attracting the local
people's attention," he said, without elaborating on when the
alleged incursion took place.


The incident happened close to Iran's border with Iraq, where the
US  and British military are deployed in force.


The US is in a mounting diplomatic confrontation with Iran over
its uranium enrichment and Western suspicions that Tehran is bent
on developing nuclear weapons, a charge vehemently denied by
Iran.


Washington says it wants a diplomatic solution to the nuclear
standoff, but it has never ruled out a military option.


Tensions have spiked since Iran's seizure on March 23 of 15
British marines and sailors for allegedly entering Iranian
waters.


Iran says the Britons illegally entered its territorial waters
while London insists they were in Iraqi waters on a anti-
smuggling patrol under UN mandate.
