Scotland's world champion Graeme Dott beat English wildcard Jamie
Cope 9-5 to win the China Open and claim snooker's number one
ranking here on Sunday.


The Scot raced to a 6-2 lead in the first session of the best-
of-17 final, knocking in breaks of 72, 60, 70 and 95.


Cope, 21, recovered to 6-5 before Dott produced breaks of 124,
120 and 64 in the last three frames to claim only his second
title.


Dott's win placed him above Ken Doherty in the snooker rankings,
giving him a boost as he prepares for his world title defence at
Sheffield's Crucible Theatre.


"Winning any tournament gives you confidence and it's a great
boost for me looking ahead to the Crucible," he said.


Dott had downed James Wattana, John Higgins and Ronnie O'Sullivan
on his way to the final.


The 29-year-old beat Peter Ebdon last May to win the world
championship, the first professional title of his career.
