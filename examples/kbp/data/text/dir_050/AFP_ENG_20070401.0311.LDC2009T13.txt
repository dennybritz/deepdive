Spain's Pablo Martin created golfing history here on Sunday when
he captured the Portugal Open to become the first amateur to win
on the European Tour.


The 20-year-old from Malaga who was tied for third, two shots off
the overnight lead, produced a closing round 68 to take his place
in the record books with a seven under par total of 277.


France's Raphael Jacquelin came in second, one shot behind.
