World champion Sebastien Loeb claimed the Rally of Portugal on
Sunday after dominating throughout the weekend's racing.


Citroen driver Loeb finished 37 seconds clear of championship
leader Marcus Gronholm of Finland with another Finn Mikko
Hirvonen in third.


It was the Frenchman's second rally victory in a row folling his
triumph in Mexico last month. He has won three of the five
rallies this season.


The triple world champion took over the lead from former double
world champion Gronholm on Friday night following the seventh
stage. And he never looked back, winning 11 of the 18 stages.


Loeb is now just two points behind Ford Focus driver Gronholm in
the world championship standings.
