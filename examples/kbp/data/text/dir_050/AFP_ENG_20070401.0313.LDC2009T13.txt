Britain is in "direct bilateral communication" with Iran over the
detention of 15 British naval personnel, Defence Secretary Des
Browne told BBC television Sunday.


In an interview conducted in Afghanistan, Browne said there was
"no reason" for Iran to continue to hold the group.


"We are anxious that this matter be resolved as quickly as
possible and that it be resolved by diplomatic means and we are
bending every single effort to that," he said.


"It's not my intention to go through the detail of that blow-by-
blow and it wouldn't be appropriate to do that, but we are in
direct bilateral communication with the Iranians and they know
that not only are we in a very clear position but that we have
the support of almost all of the international community.


"The message from the UN, the message from the European Union
ought to make it clear to them that their responsibility is to
release our detained personnel."


Browne did not give further details of the contacts.
