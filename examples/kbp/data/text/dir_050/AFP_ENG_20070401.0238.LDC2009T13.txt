Liverpool striker Peter Crouch fears he will be dropped for his
side's Champions League clash with PSV Eindhoven despite his hat-
trick against Arsenal.


Crouch scored his first treble for the Reds as he returned from a
broken nose to help Rafa Benitez's side demolish 4-1 Arsenal at
Anfield on Saturday.


The England international had been sidelined for three weeks
following surgery on nose injury and he made up for lost time
against the Gunners.


However, Crouch knows Benitez likes to rotate his strikers and he
could well be replaced by either Dirk Kuyt or Craig Bellamy when
Liverpool travel to PSV for the first leg of their Champions
League quarter-final on Tuesday.


"You can never be sure you will keep your place, even for Tuesday
in Eindhoven in the Champions League," Crouch said. "This is a
big club with big players."


"If the manager feels fresh legs are needed, so be it because I
know I will play a good share of games. And if I play I know I
will score goals.


"We have to accept there will be rotation at club level, but to
come in like I have and score three is a real boost.


"When you do get a chance to play at a club like Liverpool, you
have to score on a regular basis. When I am given the opportunity
I have to take it."
