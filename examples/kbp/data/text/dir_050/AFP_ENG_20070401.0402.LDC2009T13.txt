A firebrand far-right leader in Slovakia lashed out at the United
States on Sunday for supporting a UN plan to give supervised
independence to Kosovo, local media reported.


"The world is under the US dictate, authorised by its democracy,
destroying whole nations," Jan Slota said during a televised
debate, according to the Slovak news agency SITA.


Slota's Slovak Nationalist Party forms part of the governing
coalition in the small central European nation, which is opposed
to Kosovo independence from Serbia.


The issue is a thorny one in Slovakia, with some politicians
fearing it could provoke its own Hungarian minority to seek
autonomy.


UN chief mediator Martti Ahtisaari is to brief the UN Security
Council on his recommendations for the ethnic Albanian-majority
breakaway province in Serbia on Tuesday.


Slovakia currently holds a non-permanent, non-veto-wielding seat
in the 15-member council.


Ahtisaari's report argues for a form of supervised independence
for Kosovo under the wing of the international community. Serbia
and Russia have denounced the plan.


Kosovo has been administered by a UN mission since mid-1999,
after a NATO bombing campaign ended the brutal crackdown by
Serbian forces against the province's ethnic-Albanian majority.


Some 10,000 ethnic Albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled
Kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict.


Slota also criticised the NATO bombing campaign.


"Thousands of innocent people died during the bombardment and
Serbia suffered more destruction than during World War II," Slota
said.
