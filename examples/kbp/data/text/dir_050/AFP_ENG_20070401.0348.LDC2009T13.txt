Victoria Pendleton won the women's keirin crown to hand Britain
their seventh gold medal in the final race of the world track
cycling championships here Sunday.


Pendleton, who won the women's sprint crown on Saturday, finished
convincingly ahead of strong Chinese racer Shuang Guo in a two-
man race for the finish line.


Australia's Anna Meares was a few bike lengths back but dominated
her two other rivals to claim the bronze.
