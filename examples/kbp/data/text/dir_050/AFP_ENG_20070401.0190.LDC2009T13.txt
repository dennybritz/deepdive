Benin held its breath Sunday for the first official results from
legislative elections seen as a political yardstick for President
Boni Yayi a year after he took office pledging to fight
corruption.


The first trend in the results from Saturday's polls would be
announced later Sunday, electoral commission spokesman Michel
Allokpo said.


"Given that some voting stations opened very late yesterday, the
results will be counted as they come in and the first major
trends will be available as early as this afternoon," he said.


Final results, however, are not expected for several more days,
according to people close to the electoral commission.


Preliminary estimates Saturday evening showed that turnout was
more than 50 percent, whereas in March 2006 more than 70 per cent
of voters turned out for the presidential poll in which Boni
Yayi, a banker and a newcomer to politics, emerged as winner.


Some four million Beninese were eligible to vote out of a
population of 7.9 million at more than 15,300 polling stations
spread across the west African nation under the eyes of over 200
domestic and international observers.


Voters were choosing 83 members of the legislature from among
2,158 candidates.


The vote will be a key measure of support for Yayi, a former
development banker and a virtual political unknown when he was
the surprise winner of the presidential poll in March last year.
