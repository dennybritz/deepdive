US warplanes have violated Iranian airspace in the southwestern
oil-rich province of Khuzestan, Al-Alam Arabic language news
satellite channel quoted a local military chief as saying on
Sunday.


"Two aircraft trespassed into Iranian airspace northwest of (the
southwestern port city of) Abadan before flying southwest into
Iraq," a local Revolutionary Guards commander in Abadan
identified only as Colonel Aqili was quoted as saying on the
channel's website.


"The planes left white vapour trails, attracting the local
people's attention," he said, without elaborating on when the
alleged incursion took place.
