Filipino boxer Lito Sisnorio has died after sustaining serious
head injuries during a loss to former Thai champion Chatchai
Sasakul here, hospital officials said Sunday.


Officials said Sisnorio was admitted to Bangkok's Piyamin
hospital late on Friday after he went down in the fourth round
against the Thai former WBC super flyweight champion Chatchai.
Sisnorio died late Saturday.


"He was admitted Friday and died last night," a hospital official
told AFP.


Thai news websites reported that Sisnorio, 24, had suffered a
blood clot in his brain and had emergency surgery on Friday
night, although the hospital would not confirm this.


The Filipino's body was transferred to another private hospital
for the family to claim, the Piyamin official said.
