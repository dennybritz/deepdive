Spain's Pablo Martin created golfing history here on Sunday when
he captured the Portugal Open to become the first amateur to win
on the European Tour.


The 20-year-old from Malaga who was tied for third, two shots off
the overnight lead, produced a closing round 68 to take his place
in the record books with a seven under par total of 277.


France's Raphael Jacquelin came in second, one shot behind.


While taking the glory  Martin's status denied him the chance to
pocket the 141,157 pounds winners' pay cheque.


The last amateur to win a professional event in Europe was Dr
David Sheehan of Ireland in the 1962 Jeyes Tournament at Royal
Dublin before the European Tour was created.


Martin may have been experiencing the best moment of his
fledgling playing career but for Sweden's Alex Noren this was a
day to forget as the leader going into the fourth round slumped
to a share of 11th place with a final day's 76.
