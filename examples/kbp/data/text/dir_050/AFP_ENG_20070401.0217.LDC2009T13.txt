The 12 yachts competing for this year's America's Cup unveiled
their boats here on Sunday showing nothing revolutionary in their
designs, organisers said.


The world's most prestigious yachting race reaches its climax
this summer in Europe for the first time when Swiss champion
Alinghi, unable to defend its title in its landlocked country,
races the winner of the Louis Vuitton Cup in the America's Cup
Match off Valencia between June 23 and July 7.


Two days before the start of the Louis Vuitton Act 13, the last
of the preliminaries before the round robin stages, the 11
challengers plus holders Alinghi unveiled their designs which had
largely similar hulls and keels.


This was in stark contrast to the 1983 winner Australia II, for
instance, which became the first challenger in 132 years to win
the cup with its revolutionary "winged" keel.
