World champion Sebastien Loeb claimed the Rally of Portugal on
Sunday after dominating throughout the weekend's racing.


Citroen driver Loeb finished 37 seconds clear of championship
leader Marcus Gronholm of Finland with another Finn Mikko
Hirvonen in third.


It was the Frenchman's second rally victory in a row following
his triumph in Mexico last month. He has won three of the five
rallies this season.


"I won the rally on Saturday when we twice came up with the right
tyre choice," he reflected.


"That helped me take a slender advantage over Marcus (Gronholm)
and then when he made a mistake I extended my lead."


The triple world champion took over the lead from former double
world champion Gronholm on Friday night following the seventh
special stage. And he never looked back, winning 11 of the 18
stages.


Loeb is now just two points behind Ford Focus driver Gronholm in
the world championship standings.


Gronholm said: "It was a good weekend, but not perfect. On the
positive side I'm still leading the championship but I really
wanted to win here."


The world rally championship takes a month-long break before
resuming in Argentina on May 4.
