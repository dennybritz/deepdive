South Africa earned a 175,000-dollar bonus on Sunday for topping
the ICC one-day international rankings at the annual cut-off date
for the first time.


Australia, in second place, will pocket 75,000 dollars for being
the runner-up. Australia remain on top of the Test rankings.


Sunday's achievement marks the end of a great 12 months of one-
day cricket for South Africa.


Graeme Smith's side assumed first place from Australia last month
following an outstanding run of results over the past year, which
saw the team win 15 of its 21 ODIs ahead of the World Cup and
three out of four matches since the tournament began.


It was the first time a side has overtaken Australia in the table
since the listings began in October 2002.


Although South Africa lost to Ricky Ponting's men in their Group
A game in St Kitts last week, it was not quite enough to dislodge
the Proteas from top spot.


South Africa's one-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the Super
Eight stage in Guyana on Wednesday proved to be the result that
took them over the top, giving them an unassailable if wafer-thin
lead at the top of the ladder.


"I'm delighted that we are top of the ODI Championship and I
think it is a just reward for all the hard work and dedication
the guys have shown over the past 18 months or so," said South
Africa captain Graeme Smith.


"That said, although this is very pleasing for us it will not
detract us from the immediate job at hand. We are completely
focused on the World Cup and we want to do the very best that we
can while we are here in the Caribbean," he said.
