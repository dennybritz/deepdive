An agreement has been reached to take failed Democratic Republic
of Congo presidential candidate Jean-Pierre Bemba, whose guards
recently clashed with the military, to Portugal for medical
treatment, the Portuguese ambassador said Sunday.


Ambassador Alfredo Duarte Costa said an agreement "in principal"
had been made between Congolese authorities, the UN mission in
the country and Portugal to evacuate Bemba, a former rebel
leader.


Bemba committed to not engage in any political activity while in
Portugal, Costa said.


Bemba would be in Portugal for "several weeks" for treatment on a
leg injury unrelated to the recent clashes, his supporters say.
He underwent an operation on his leg at a Lisbon hospital in
December.


"What we simply need from the Congolese authorities is that their
verbal agreement on the departure of Mr. Bemba for treatment
become a written agreement," Costa said.


He added that he hoped the situation would be resolved in the
coming days.


Bemba has been holed up at the South African embassy in Kinshasa
since violent clashes between his supporters and government
troops on March 22-23 in which at least 163 people were killed.
Talks on his potential evacuation have been occurring for days.
