Referee Miguel Angel Perez Lima must have thought that the best
way to get Getafe's Javier Paredes into the dressing room at the
end of the 2-2 draw with Real Zaragoza on Sunday was to send him
off.


Paredes picked up his second yellow card after the whistle had
been blown nearly four minutes into injury time.


"After I had blown the whistle... Javier Peredes was booked for
coming at me running, with his arms held high, saying 'How can
you blow the final whistle now'," wrote Perez Lima in his
referee's report.


The dismissal will go down as one of the more bizarre of this
season in the Spanish first division.


There was no suggestion that Paredes had actually sworn or abused
Perez Lima although the player later apologised to the official
for losing his self- control.


Getafe had came from two goals down to snatch a point in a 2-2
draw with fifth- placed Zaragoza.


Sergio Garcia put Zaragoza ahead midway through the first half
and then Andres D'Alessandro got one of the best goals of the
season 10 minutes before the break, scoring from a wonderful free
kick 35 metres out on the right wing.


Manu Del Moral's header brought Getafe back into the game after
41 minutes and Francisco Casquero equalised on the hour with a
left foot shot.


When Perez Lima finally called time, and incensed Paredes, Getafe
were pressing hard for a winner.
