Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I know they had a machinery breakdown which didn't help things.
But I went and spoke to the umpires at one stage and they said
the groundstaff were on their lunchbreak. That was a little more
time that was killed."


- Australia skipper Ricky Ponting angry over the series of delays
that reduced the match with Bangladesh in Antigua to a
22-over-a-side game.


"Wasim Akram is one of the greatest bowlers of all time, a left-
armer who swings it both ways with the new ball. To go past him
is something special and something I'll always remember."


- Glenn McGrath after passing Akram's World Cup wickets record.


"They've come a long way since I first started playing against
them and the exciting thing about them is that they've got a few
17, 18, 19-year-old kids in their side which is exciting for any
team to have."


- Ponting on Bangladesh after the Australians' 10-wicket win over
the Asian side.


"The guys are firing up front and it would be good for our middle
order to fire as well."


- Herschelle Gibbs on the need for the rest of the South African
team to find some form.


"Matty has been the standout performer. He's in really
intimidating form at the moment."


- Adam Gilchrist on his opening partner Matthew Hayden.
