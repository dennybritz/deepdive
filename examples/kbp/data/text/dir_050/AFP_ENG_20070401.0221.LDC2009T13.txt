President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday promised fresh news on
Iran's disputed nuclear programme which Tehran insists is
peaceful but the West suspects serves as cover for atomic weapons
ambitions.


"The Iranian people will hear news about nuclear developments
soon," the state news agency IRNA quoted him as saying on the
anniversary of the 1979 foundation of the Islamic republic,
without giving details.


The UN Security Council last month applied new sanctions on Iran
for its continued refusal to suspend uranium enrichment -- the
process which makes nuclear fuel but can be used as well as the
fissile core of a bomb.


Tehran has told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it
plans to install 3,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment at an
underground facility in Natanz, central Iran.


A 3,000-centrifuge facility could produce enough enriched uranium
for one atomic bomb in less than a year.


In April 2006, Iran announced that it had successfully enriched
uranium to 3.5 percent. Weapons-grade material needs to be
enriched more than 90 percent.


Iran has retaliated against the UN sanctions by withholding
immediate notification of its plans to build or modify nuclear
facilities, saying notice would only come six months before they
are brought into service.
