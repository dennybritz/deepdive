American Bubba Watson takes a three stroke lead into Sunday's
final round of the 5.5 million dollar PGA Houston Open.


The suspended third round had to be completed Sunday morning
after Saturday's start of play was suspended six hours because of
rain.


Watson had 10 birdies and one bogey through 15 holes on Saturday
to move to 15-under before rain suspended play.


When play resumed on Sunday morning, Watson bogeyed one of his
final three holes to complete a round of eight-under-par 64 and
is 14-under overall.


In his second full year on the PGA Tour, Watson is seeking his
first career win. He has two top-10 finishes in eight events this
year.


Jeff Maggert also bogeyed one of his six holes on Sunday morning
to finish off his round of five-under 67 to fall to 11-under
overall.


Defending champion Stuart Appleby birdied one of his last three
holes Sunday morning to move into a tie for second at 11-under.


Johnson Wagner was able to play his entire third round on
Saturday, signing for a 64 and moving to 11-under. Wagner had
five straight birdies starting at the par-four fifth hole.


Paul Stankowski (65) and Australian Adam Scott (65) also are at
11-under. At fifth in the world, Scott is the highest-ranked
player in the field.


Most of the top players have chosen to practice their way into
form leading up to The Masters.


Tiger Woods, defending Masters champion Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els
and three-time Houston Open champion Vijay Singh all are taking
this week off.
