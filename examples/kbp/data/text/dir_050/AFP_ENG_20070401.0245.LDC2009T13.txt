Some 10,000 people have fled the fierce fighting in the Somali
capital Mogadishu over the past three days alone, the UN refugee
agency said Sunday.


The latest figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
brought the total of displaced people to nearly 100,000.


Up to 56,000 people fled the city in March, most of them since
March 21, when the first major clashes erupted between Ethiopian
troops backing Somalia's provisional government and Islamist
fighters.


An estimated 40,000 people had already fled Mogadishu in
February, UNHCR spokesman William Spindler told AFP.


"The exodus from the Somali capital continues and the figure is
expected to rise as people living close to the conflict area are
abandoning their homes due to mortar shells and fears that the
fighting will spread," he said.


People fleeing the fighting had moved out to the neighbouring
regions of Middle Shabelle, Lower Shabelle, Hiraan, Bay,
Galagadud and Mudug, said Spindler.


The fourth straight day of heavy fighting Sunday left a trail of
devastation in the Somali capital as Ugandan peacekeepers
reported their first death and clan elders called for a
ceasefire.
