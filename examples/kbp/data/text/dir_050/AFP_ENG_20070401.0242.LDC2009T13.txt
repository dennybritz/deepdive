West Indies captain Brian Lara elected to field after winning the
toss against Sri Lanka in a World Cup Super Eights match at the
Providence Stadium here on Sunday.


The West Indies are in a must-win situation after losing to
defending champions Australia and New Zealand in their first two
matches in the second round.


They have two points from three games, thanks to their win over
fellow- qualifiers Ireland in the group.


Sri Lanka are playing their second match in the second round,
having lost to South Africa here on Wednesday. They have two
points from as many games, following their victory over
qualifiers Bangladesh in the group.


Sri Lanka made one change from the side that played against South
Africa as they brought in paceman Dilhara Fernando in place of
Farveez Maharoof.


The West Indies replaced Lendl Simmons and Corey Collymore with
pacemen Ian Bradshaw and Jerome Taylor from the side that played
the last match against New Zealand.
