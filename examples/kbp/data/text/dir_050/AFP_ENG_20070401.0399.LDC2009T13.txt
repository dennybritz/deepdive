A British holidaymaker returned to his home in central England to
find that thieves had stolen everything in his kitchen, quite
literally stealing the sink, his home insurance company said on
Monday.


Burglars had broken into James Elstub's Dewsbury home while he
was vacationing in Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and the
United States, and stripped his kitchen, taking his oven, all the
wall units, and the sink.


"I can't believe I returned home from my holiday to find burglars
had stolen my kitchen sink," Elstub said, adding that he had to
endure two weeks of microwave meals while his kitchen was
replaced.


Halifax Home Insurance, Elstub's insurer, said he -- and all
holidaymakers -- should do their best to make homes look like
they were being occupied by having friends and family visit, and
installing timers on lights inside.
