US and South Korean officials negotiating a free trade agreement
will keep talking past a 1:00 am (1600 GMT Sunday) deadline, a
trade ministry spokesman said early Monday.


The spokesman, Han Dong-Man, gave no other details. The talks had
been scheduled to end at 1:00 am after an earlier deadline was
extended by 48 hours.


Any pact must be submitted to Congress Monday if it is to be
passed while President George W. Bush retains his authority to
"fast-track" the deal through the legislature.
