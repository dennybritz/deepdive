Tenth seed Novak Djokovic defeated Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-2, 6-4
here Sunday in the final of the 6.9 million dollar ATP Miami
Masters Series event.


The 19-year-old Serbian became the first teenager to capture the
championship since 1990 when a 19-year-old Andre Agassi defeated
Stefan Edberg in the final.


It was the first Masters Series and fourth career ATP title for
Djokovic, who also became the first player since Ivan Lendl in
1989 to win a championship here without dropping a set.


"I played unbelievable tennis in Indian Wells and here," Djokovic
said. "The best tennis of my life. I didn't lose a set."


Djokovic clinched the win with a forehand winner on the first
championship point that froze Canas in his tracks.


He hammered six aces, converted four of seven break point
opportunities and had just one double fault in the two hour, 19
minute match.


"When you play final nothing is easy," Djokovic said. "I think he
is great player. I am so proud for my country.


Canas was attempting to become only the second unseeded player to
win this tournament.


The 29-year-old Argentine rocked the tennis world with two wins
in a three-week span over Federer, the world's No. 1 player.


The first came on March 11 and ended the Swiss superstar's
41-match winning streak. Then in the fourth round here on
Tuesday, Canas beat Federer again.


"Today I tried my best it just wasn't enough to beat him," said
Canas, who had five double faults on Sunday.


Canas had no answers for Djokovic, who held every service game
and lost serve just once in 59 games in the tournament.


The slender Serb displayed his power with a blistering serve and
an assortment of drop shots, including one that ended a game that
lasted 20 minutes and featured 22 points in the second set.
