Google announced a novel way to access the Internet -- via the
toilet -- in an April Fool's Day gag on its website Sunday.


The Mountain View, California-based technology concern introduced
its "Dark Porcelain" project, with self-installed Internet access
via computer users' household plumbing.


The "Toilet Internet Service Provider" (TiSP) project highlighted
on Google's webpage is "a self-installed, ad-supported online
service that will be offered entirely free to any consumer with a
WiFi-capable PC and a toilet connected to a local municipal
sewage system."


"We've got that whole organizing-the-world's-information thing
more or less under control," the website says, quoting Google co-
founder and president Larry Page.


"What's interesting, though, is how many different modalities
there are for actually getting that information to you -- not to
mention from you," the mock press release read.


The company hailed the breakthrough technology "that takes
advantage of preexisting plumbing and sewage systems and their
related hydraulic data- transmission capabilities."


"There's actually a thriving little underground community that's
been studying this exact solution for a long time," said Page.


"And today our Toilet ISP team is pleased to be leading the way
through the sewers, up out of your toilet and -- splat -- right
onto your PC."
