About half of the additional 30,000 US troops despatched by
President George W. Bush to quell the raging violence in Iraq
have been deployed in the war-torn country, a military spokesman
said Sunday.


The bulk of these troops are being deployed in Baghdad where a
brutal insurgency and sectarian violence have killed tens of
thousands of civilians.


"About half of US troop reinforcements are currently in place
with the remainder expected to be in place by early June," Rear
Admiral Mark Fox told reporters in Baghdad.


He said the rest of the troops are either "in or approaching
Kuwait" from where they will enter Iraq.


Some of the new troops are also being deployed in the western
Sunni province of Anbar where a fiery insurgency has inflicted a
heavy toll on US military in the four years since the invasion.


About 80,000 US and Iraqi troops are currently patrolling the
streets of Baghdad to curb the violence as part of the security
crackdown Operation Fardh al-Qanoon (Imposing Law) launched on
February 14.
