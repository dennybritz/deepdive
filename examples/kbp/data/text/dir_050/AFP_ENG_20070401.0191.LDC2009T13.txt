Palestinian foreign minister Ziad Abu Amr arrived in Paris Sunday
on his first visit to a European capital since a unity cabinet
was sworn in last month, brightening prospects for a resumption
of aid.


Abu Amr was due to meet with Palestinian groups in France later
in the day before holding talks on Monday with French Foreign
Minister Philippe Douste- Blazy, a Palestinian source said.


He meets with Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin on Tuesday.


This visit will provide an opportunity to discuss "how we can
resume our direct financial aid" to the Palestinian government,
foreign ministry spokesman Denis Simonneau said this week.


Abu Amr is an independent in the new government formed in March
that unites the radical Hamas Islamist movement with moderates in
hope that the West will lift an aid and diplomatic embargo.


France has said it would resume contacts with Palestinian
government members not belonging to Hamas and has called for a
resumption of European aid to the Palestinians.
