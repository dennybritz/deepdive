Rain delayed the start of the World Cup Super Eights match
between Sri Lanka and the West Indies at the Providence Stadium
here on Sunday.


The West Indies are in a must-win situation after losing to
defending champions Australia and New Zealand in their first two
matches in the second round.


They have two points from three games, thanks to their win over
fellow- qualifiers Ireland in the group.


Sri Lanka are playing their second match in the second round,
having lost to South Africa here on Wednesday. They have two
points from as many games, following their victory over
qualifiers Bangladesh in the group.
