Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday promised fresh
news on the country's nuclear "developments" which Tehran insists
are peaceful but the West suspects hides nuclear weapons
ambitions.


"Iranian people will hear news about nuclear developments soon,"
the state news agency IRNA quoted him as saying, without giving
any details.


The UN Security Council last month imposed more sanctions on Iran
for its continued refusal to suspend uranium enrichment -- the
process which makes nuclear fuel but can be used as well as the
fissile core of an atom bomb.
