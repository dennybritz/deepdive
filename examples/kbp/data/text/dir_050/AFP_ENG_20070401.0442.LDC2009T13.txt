Eight candidates including one woman and the current leader will
stand in the first round of Mali's presidential election on April
29, the country's constitutional court said on Sunday.


The eight are: President Amadou Toumani Toure, Ibrahim Boubacar
Keita -- the speaker of parliament -- Mamadou Blaise Sangare,
Tiebile Drame, Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga, Oumar Marikom, Sidibe
Aminata Diallo and Madiassa Maguiriraga.


All except Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga and Sidibe Aminata Diallo, the
only female candidate, stood in the arid west African nation's
last election in 2002, won in the second round by the current
president.


Mali, a landlocked former French colony with a population of 11.7
million, was governed by military dictatorship for more than 20
years until the early 1990s.
