Britain's Queen Elizabeth II visit France next week to honour the
memory of Canadian soldiers who died during a World War I battle,
Buckingham Palace said Sunday.


The Queen, accompanied by French Prime Minister Dominique de
Villepin and Canadian premier Stephen Harper, will lay a wreath
on April 9 at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, near Arras,
northern France.


The event will commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Battle of
Vimy Ridge, when some 3,500 Canadian Corps troops were killed
over four days as they seized control of the ridge from German
soldiers in 1917.


It is thought that around 10,000 were injured.


The party, which will also include the British monarch's husband,
Prince Philip, will hold a minute's silence and the Last Post
will be played.


The day's events will also include a parade of flaming torches.


Thousands of Canadians are also likely to attend, including
hundreds of high school students wearing replica World War I
tunics stitched with the name of a soldier who fought in the
conflict.
