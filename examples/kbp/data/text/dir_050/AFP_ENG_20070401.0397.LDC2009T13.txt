Tensions between Brussels' Kurdish and Turkish communities flared
Sunday following a fire in Kurdish cultural centre, police said.


Police used water cannons to break up a crowd of about 300 to 400
Turkish youths gathered in a confrontation with about 50 Kurds
protesting in the street where the fire occurred, police
spokesman Roland Thiebault said.


"After three charges with the cannons, the most angry ones went
away and the situation calmed down," he said, adding that five
ethnic Turks were arrested.


It was not known who started the fire that sparked the tensions,
but ethnic Turks set fire in the past to another nearby Kurdish
cultural centre.
