The Israeli government on Sunday approved the building of a major
military complex in the Negev desert that will house up to a
dozen army bases.


The "training base city", to be built near the city of Beersheva,
will house up to 11,000 personnel and have a post office,
library, shopping mall, restaurants, hospital, police station,
banks, a pool and a train station.


Israeli officials hailed the project, saying it marked a major
step in developing the desert region.


But ecologists have criticised the project, saying the region
where the military city will be located already houses polluting
industrial sites.
