The United Nations on Sunday welcomed the formation of a new
interim government in Nepal containing former rebel Maoists, but
warned the government it faced a long list of tough challenges.


"I welcome the establishment of the new interim government as a
key moment for the consolidation of Nepal's peace process," Ian
Martin, the world body's chief representative to Nepal's peace
process, said in a statement.


"I congratulate the leaders of the eight political parties on
their willingness to share responsibilities."


The UN was invited by Nepal's government and Maoists to register
and monitor the former rebels' weapons and army, and to assist in
crucial elections that are due to be held on June 20.


"A truly unified government should be in a stronger position to
face the challenges still ahead," he said.


These include holding "credible" elections, "addressing the
legitimate demands of groups in Nepalese society calling for more
inclusive democracy, establishing effective law enforcement
across the country, and providing for the future of former
combatants and a wider reform of the security sector."


The UN monitoring team has registered just over 31,000 Maoist
fighters and 3,430 weapons as part of the peace process.


The Maoists and Nepal's government made a landmark peace pact
late last year ending a decade of bloody civil war that killed at
least 13,000 people.
