The pilot and a passenger were killed Sunday after their twin-
engined plane crashed in the Austrian Alps, an Austrian transport
group said.


The Piper aircraft came down at Ossiacher Tauern, 350 kilometres
(217 miles) southwest of Vienna, said the Austrian motoring club.


According to initial police reports, the two people killed were
German and the only ones on board the six-seater plane, which was
probably heading for Klagenfurt, the capital of the southern
province of Carinthia.


An inquiry has been opened to determine the cause of the crash.
