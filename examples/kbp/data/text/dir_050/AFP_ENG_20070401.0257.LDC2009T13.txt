Avalanches in remote northern Pakistan have left at least 29
people dead with another 13 still missing, police said Sunday.


In the worst case case, snow buried 26 houses in the village of
Washik Chitral Tor late on Saturday, local police official Ali
Khan said.


"Twenty-four bodies have been taken out from the snow and rubble,
13 others were still missing and six others were pulled out
alive," Khan told AFP, updating an earlier toll.


Another avalanche crashed down on a house in Garam Chashma
village on Sunday, killing five members of the same family,
emergency police and local mayor Sartaj Ahmed Khan said.


There were no further details about injuries, as communication
systems in the area had broken down because of the bad weather,
Khan said.


The villages are 150 kilometres (93 miles) north and 90
kilometres northwest respectively of Chitral, the region's main
town.


Rescue efforts were also hampered by heavy snowfall which had
closed roads in the region. Authorities were arranging for
helicopters to send relief supplies and help search for the
missing, he said.
