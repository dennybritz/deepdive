Six more US troops have been killed in action in Iraq, the
military announced Sunday, adding that a seventh had died in a
non-combat incident.


Two soldiers were killed and another two wounded when a roadside
bomb detonated near their unit southwest of the capital on
Saturday, the military said.


"Four additional soldiers were killed when a second improvised
explosive device (IED) detonated near a separate unit responding
to the initial IED strike southwest of the Iraqi capital April
1," it added.


A marine also died on Sunday "in a non-combat related incident in
Al-Anbar province" west of Baghdad.


The deaths brought to 3,250 the US military's losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion, according to an AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.
