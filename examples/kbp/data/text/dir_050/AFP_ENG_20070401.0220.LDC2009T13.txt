Spanish police have arrested two more people in connection with a
smashed commando unit of the armed Basque separatist group ETA,
reports said Sunday.


The two men were arrested in the Guipuzcoa region, Cadena Ser
radio reported a day after authorities announced they had broken
up the unit, known as "Donosti" and based near San Sebastian.


Officials claimed the unit was behind 24 attacks in Spain between
2004 and 2006. The latest arrests, if confirmed, would bring to
10 the number of suspects held including the alleged ringleader,
Jose Angel Lerin Sanchez.


Materials to make around 170 kilos (375 pounds) of explosives
also have been recovered.


The police operation began on Wednesday and was one of the
biggest since ETA's "permanent ceasefire" declaration in March
2006.


Computer equipment was also seized and files were being analysed.
More arrests and seizures could follow, the interior ministry
said in a statement.


In one of the raids carried out on Friday night in the Basque
country and Navarra, around 140 kilos of explosive materials were
recovered in an apartment in the town of Berriozar.


The interior ministry does not believe the unit was behind ETA's
December 30 blast at Madrid airport which killed two people.


The blast dramatically ended ETA's nine-month-old unilaterally
declared ceasefire and led Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero to break off all contact with the militants.


ETA is blamed for 819 deaths in its 38-year campaign to win
independence for the Basque region. Both the European Union and
the US State Department consider it a terrorist organisation.
