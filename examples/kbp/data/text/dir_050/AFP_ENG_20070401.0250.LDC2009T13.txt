Turkish soldiers killed three militants from the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) during clashes in the country's
restive southeast, local officials said Sunday.


The fighting broke out during a security operation in the Bestler
region in Sirnak province which borders Iraq and Syria, the
Sirnak governor's office said in a statement, carried by the
Anatolia news agency.


The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Ankara and much of
the international community, called a unilateral ceasefire on
October 1, saying it hoped to pave the way for a peaceful
resolution of the conflict with Ankara.


The truce, like previous ones called by the rebels, was rejected
by Turkey, but fighting has decreased markedly since then.


More than 37,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the PKK
took up arms for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast.
