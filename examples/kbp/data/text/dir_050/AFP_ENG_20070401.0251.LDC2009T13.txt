Sri Lanka protested Sunday against an Amnesty International
campaign at the cricket World Cup drawing attention to alleged
human rights abuses on the island.


The London-based rights group has been calling for Sri Lanka to
'Play by the Rules' in its conflict with Tamil rebels by
persuading thousands of fans to sign special cricket balls and
join in activities at the tournament in the Caribbean.


"This is a campaign to tarnish the image of the country and the
government and the people of Sri Lanka overwhelmingly disapprove
it," said Chandrapala Liyanage, a top official in President
Mahinda Rajapakse's office.


Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), the sport's governing body, has lodged a
protest with the International Cricket Council.


"We have already written to the International Cricket Council
(ICC) on the issue," said SLC secretary K. Mathivanan, adding
that Sri Lanka team manager Michael Tissera had been asked to
"take up the matter with the ICC."


Amnesty says the Sri Lankan government, Tamil rebels and other
armed groups must commit themselves to allowing independent human
rights monitors to oversee the island's long-running conflict.


"Please note that the campaign is in no way aimed at the Sri
Lankan cricket team," the group said in a statement.


Rights activists have said that more than 750 people have
disappeared in the island in the past year as government troops
battle Tamil Tiger rebels.


In recent months, bodies have been found of people shot dead
"execution-style" and dumped in swamps and roadsides.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest round of
fighting since December 2005 despite a Norwegian arranged truce.
