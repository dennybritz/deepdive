Marius Zaliukas punished a blunder by Hibernian goalkeeper Andy
McNeil to give Hearts a 1-0 win against their bitter local rivals
on Sunday.


Zaliukas struck with nine minutes left after McNeil's weak punch
fell perfectly for him to drive home and hand Hearts their first
victory at Easter Road since November 2002.


Fourth-placed Hearts are now eight points ahead of Edinburgh
enemies Hibernian and, more importantly, remain firmly in the
race for a UEFA Cup place.


Hibernian, playing in front of their own fans for the first time
since lifting the League Cup, almost fell behind in the seventh
minute when Andrew Driver forced a fine stop from Andy McNeil at
his near-post.


After that early threat, Hearts were on the back foot for much of
the match.


The hosts' first incisive attack came in the 15th minute when
Lewis Stevenson's cross picked out Steven Fletcher and he flicked
on to Scott Brown, whose strike was pushed away by Craig Gordon.


Then Abdessalam Benjelloun's goal-bound header was cleared by
Bruno Aguiar before Fletcher curled a free-kick just over.


Hibs defender Rob Jones had two headed chances from David Murphy
free-kicks after half-time, but couldn't trouble Gordon on either
occasion.


But, with Hibs running out of steam, the visitors pushed forward
and centre-back Zaliukas stole the points in the 81st minute
after O'Neil flapped at a deep free-kick.
