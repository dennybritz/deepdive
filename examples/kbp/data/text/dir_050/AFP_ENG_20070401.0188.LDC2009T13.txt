England defender Luke Young has revealed that several of the
national team's stars feared they would be attacked by their own
supporters during the Euro 2008 qualifier against Andorra.


Young was among a group of players who were subjected to vicious
abuse from English supporters as they sat in the stands at the
Olympic Stadium in Barcelona on Wednesday to watch England's 3-0
win.


Frank Lampard was singled-out for especially personal criticism
and, along with Young and the rest of his non-playing team-mates,
decided not to return to his seat for the second half.


Charlton right-back Young was shocked by the ugly atmosphere.


"I was up in the stands and there were sections of the crowd not
really watching the game, just throwing abuse at the players who
weren't playing," said Young.


"It's disappointing for the manager because after just 14 minutes
the boos started - I looked up at the clock to check the time.


"The guys who weren't subs didn't come out for the second half
because we were worried for our own safety.


"Steven Gerrard said it was one of the toughest games he'd played
in because of the crowd reacting to us like that."


England assistant coach Terry Venables believes players will
consider quitting international duty if the abuse continues, but
Young is determined not to be put off.


"It's been building up over a period of time and it's difficult
for the boys," said the 27-year-old.


"But it would never stop me playing for England and that goes for
everyone in the squad.


"If anything it makes you more determined to be involved and to
try and prove a few people wrong."
