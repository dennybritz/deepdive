Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas told visiting EU president and
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday that a new unity
government had met international demands for recognition.


"We told the chancellor that this government's programme meets
the international community's demands to end the siege imposed on
us," Abbas told a joint press conference with Merkel in Ramallah.


Merkel however disagreed. She said the European Union would not
have contacts with government ministers who refuse to renounce
violence and recognise Israel.


"Some of the government ministers do not accept our criteria,"
Merkel said.


The international community froze aid and contacts with the
Palestinian government in March 2006 when the hardline Islamist
Hamas, which won democratic elections, took power and refused to
recognize Israel, renounce violence, and abide by past peace
accords.


A Palestinian unity government replaced the all-Hamas cabinet
last month in a bid to end that punishing aid freeze, but has so
far failed to convince Western powers that it has met
international demands.


Many Western powers have eased their boycott by agreeing to meet
non-Hamas ministers, but have so far refused to resume direct aid
to the Palestinian Authority.
