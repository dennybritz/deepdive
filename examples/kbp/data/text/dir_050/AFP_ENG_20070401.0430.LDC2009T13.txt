Iranian state television aired new footage Sunday of two of the
15 British naval personnel it captured off Iraq last month.


The two were shown separately on the television's Arabic language
channel standing in front of an Iranian chart of the northern
Gulf waters where the sailors and marines were seized on March
23.


The original audio of their comments could not be heard but
according to a purported Arab-language translation they admitted
Iran's accusation that they were detained on the Iranian side of
the maritime boundary.


"The two servicemen are explaining that the group was carrying
out a reconnaissance mission when it penetrated Iranain
territorial waters at 10 am that day in the sector indicated by
the GPS," a voice-over commentary said.


"They are saying that the group entered the Iranian sector from
the Iraqi side.


"They are saying that they were treated in a humane manner."


Britain condemned the new pictures of its detained service
personnel.


"It's unacceptable for these pictures to be shown," a foreign
ministry spokeswoman said.
