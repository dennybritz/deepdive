Spain's Pablo Martin-Benavides created golfing history here on
Sunday when he captured the Portugal Open to become the first
amateur to win on the European Tour.


The 20-year-old from Malaga who was tied for third, two shots off
the overnight lead, produced a closing round 68 to take his place
in the record books with a seven under par total of 277.


While taking the glory Martin-Benavides's status denied him the
chance to pocket the 141,157 pounds winners' pay cheque, which
went to the runner-up, France's Raphael Jacquelin, one shot
behind.


The last amateur to win a professional event in Europe was Dr
David Sheehan of Ireland in the 1962 Jeyes Tournament at Royal
Dublin before the European Tour was created.


After claiming the first amateur success on the Tour's 1,145th
event the former winner of the British boy's title said: "It
feels great - absolutely great."


Despite this breakthrough he insisted he wouldn't bring forward
his planned move to the professional ranks in the summer.


The Oklahoma University star said: "I've already thought about
it. I've got to play with Oklahoma. They've been giving me so
many things and it does not enter my mind right now."


Martin-Benavides may have been experiencing the best moment of
his fledgling playing career but for Sweden's Alex Noren this was
a day to forget as the leader going into the fourth round slumped
to a share of 11th place with a final day's 76.
