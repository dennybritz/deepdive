Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz on Sunday instructed the
army to take "decisive action" against Palestinian militants in
the Gaza Strip in a bid to stem rocket fire.


"Peretz issued the army with clear orders to take decisive action
in order to thwart the rocket fire before, during and after they
are fired," a senior defence ministry official told AFP.


The army was also instructed "to fight attempts to plant roadside
bombs along Israel's security fence" with Gaza.


Israel last week launched a first strike against Palestinians
firing rockets from the northern Gaza Strip after a four-month
hiatus which followed a November 26 ceasefire.


On Sunday, military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin was quoted as
telling the Israeli cabinet that following several weeks of a
drop in Palestinian rocket fire, militants last week fired over
20 projectiles, causing no damage.


Chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi said last week that Israel will
have to confront what he called the strengthening of Gaza
militant groups amid reports of ongoing weapons smuggling from
Egypt into Gaza.
