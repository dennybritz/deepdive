A "magical" Australian film shot entirely in an aboriginal
language and a Norwegian film inspired by the French new wave
took the top prizes at Denmark's largest film festival, which
closed Sunday.


"Ten Canoes," from Australian director Rolf de Heers, took the
NatFilm festival's audience award, while Norwegian director
Joachim Tier's "Reprise" won the TV5Monde Critics Award,
sponsored by the French TV network.


Critics at the festival described "Ten Canoes" as "nearly
magical" and exceptional in its use of Australian aborignals to
tell the story in their own language.


The film has already picked up a clutch of awards in Australia.


"Reprise", about the friendship and rivalry between two young
writers, is inspired by films of the French new wave genre such
as the Francois Truffaut's 1961 classic "Jules and Jim".


NatFilm featured 170 films from 50 countries and attracted 40,000
spectators during its 10-day run. As well as Copenhagen, it was
hosted by the Danish cities of Aarhus, Odense et Kolding.


The prizes in the 18th NatFilm festival were awarded Saturday in
Copenhagen and the festival closed Sunday after 10 days of
events.
