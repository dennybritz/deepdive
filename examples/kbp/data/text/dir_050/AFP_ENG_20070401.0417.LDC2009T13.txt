Plans for a 21-mile (34-kilometre) bridge linking Britain and
France were submitted to former prime minister Margaret
Thatcher's government, newly declassified documents showed
Monday.


The proposals, floated in April 1981, would have seen motorists
driving 220 feet (67 metres) above the channel, and paying a toll
charge of 5.6 pounds (8.2 euros, 11 dollars) per person.


According to the records, released by the National Archives at
Kew, engineers said that private financiers were willing to put
their backing behind the project, likely drawn in by the
potential toll revenue.


Engineering group LinktoEurope dismissed the option of tunneling
under the water separating Britain and France as "impractical",
and instead said that a three- lane motorway between the two
countries -- currently connected by the Channel Tunnel -- was
best.


Though LinktoEurope admitted that the huge pylons on which the
bridge would rest could cause problems for shipping traffic
through the channel, it said that they would be sufficiently
strong to withstand a boat ploughing into them.


While there is no record of how seriously the proposal was
considered, blueprints and artists' impressions of the bridge,
submitted to the Transport Secretary, have been carefully
preserved.
