Iranian state television aired new footage Sunday of two of the
15 British naval personnel it captured off Iraq last month.


The two were shown separately on the television's Arabic language
channel standing in front of an Iranian chart of the northern
Gulf waters where the sailors and marines were seized on March
23.


The original audio of their comments could not be heard but
according to a purported Arab-language translation they admitted
Iran's accusation that they were detained on the Iranian side of
the maritime boundary and also said they were being well-treated.
