Two policemen were executed in Saudi Arabia on Sunday for
murdering a Bangladeshi taxi driver, the official state news
agency SPA said.


Abdul Rahman Al Qahtani and Mohammed Al-Ghamidi took Abdul Sitar
Ali to a remote location before robbing him and shooting him.


Their execution in the capital Riyadh was the 24th announced by
the Saudi authorities so far this year.


Executions by beheading with a sword are usually carried out in
public in ultra- conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a
strict form of sharia or Islamic law.


Last year at least 37 people were executed, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
