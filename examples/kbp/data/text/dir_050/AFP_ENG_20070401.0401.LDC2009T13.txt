A British soldier died on Sunday of gunshot wounds from small
arms fire in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, the defence
ministry said.


The soldier, whose name has not yet been released, was a member
of the 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.


"Next of kin have been informed and they have requested a period
of 24 hours before further details are released," a defence
ministry statement said.


The death of the soldier brings the number of British troops who
have died in Iraq since the US-led invasion of the country in
March 2003 to 135. Of those, 104 died in action.


About 7,200 British soldiers remain deployed in Iraq, mostly in
Basra and surrounding areas, though Prime Minister Tony Blair
told parliament in February that deployment would be cut by 1,600
troops and likely drop to 5,000 by the end of the year.


But Blair also said British troops would stay around Basra into
2008 to help Iraqi forces in a support role "for as long as we
are wanted and have a job to do."


Britain handed over the key Al-Saee base in Basra to local forces
on March 20, as part of its gradual withdrawal.
