Britain's Foreign Office insisted Sunday that demonstrations
outside its embassy in Tehran were "under control" despite
students throwing rocks and firecrackers.


"There's no damage to the building and nobody has been hurt. It
all seems to be under control and there's a police presence," a
Foreign Office spokesman told AFP.


But he could not confirm how many protestors were involved or how
long the protests had been going on for.


About 200 Islamist students demanding the trial and punishment of
15 British naval personnel seized by Iran last month have
gathered outside the embassy, an AFP correspondent said.
