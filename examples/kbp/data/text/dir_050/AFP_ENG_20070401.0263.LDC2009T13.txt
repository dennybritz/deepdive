British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said Sunday that she
held Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe "responsible" for
injuries to nine members of the opposition and "utterly"
condemned it.


"I utterly condemn the beatings by the Zimbabwe police of those
who have been arrested on charges of treason. I hold Mugabe
responsible for their injuries," she said in a statement.
