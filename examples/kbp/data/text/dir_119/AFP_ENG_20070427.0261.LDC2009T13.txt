Britain said Friday it was putting colonial slavery records
online for the first time, an archive which will eventually cover
three million slaves in South Africa, Sri Lanka and the
Caribbean.


The collection on the ancestry.co.uk website is taken from
registers lodged between 1812 and 1834.


Britain has been celebrating the bicentenary of the Abolition of
the Slave Trade Act. It was passed on March 25, 1807, imposing a
100-pound fine for every slave found aboard a British ship.


The 1833 Slavery Abolition Act outlawed slavery itself throughout
the British Empire. However, slaves did not gain their final
freedom until 1838.


Simon Harper of ancestry.co.uk said: "As few records exist which
document the lives of individual slaves, the Former British
Colonial Dependencies' Slave Register Collection, 1812-1834 will
for many be the only record of their ancestor ever having existed
and so represents a vital resource for everyone with or
interested in researching slave ancestry.


"With few relevant collections online, it has not been easy for
those with ancestors from former British colonies or territories
to research their black family history, however ancestry.co.uk's
new collection will help bridge major historical gaps for many
people."
