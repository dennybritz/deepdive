One person died and at least 43 were injured in central Tallinn
in overnight riots and looting sparked when police broke up a
protest near a Soviet war monument, officials said Friday.


"One person died after being taken to hospital and 43 have been
treated for injuries sustained in the violence," Tallinn police
chief Raivo Kuut said on Estonian Television.


The fatality was identified by police as a 20-year-old named
Dimitri, who died after being stabbed during the violence.


"There is no reason to link the death of Dimitri to police
activity," the prosecutor's office said in a statement.


Most of the injured had suffered cuts from broken glass, probably
from the shattered shopfronts of the businesses that were
vandalised during the rioting, Prime Minister Andrus Ansip told
reporters.


More than 300 people were detained following the violence which
was the worst the Baltic state has seen since restoring
independence from Moscow in 1991.
