David Beckham is sporting a new platinum blonde hairstyle as he
prepares to bring down the curtain on his Real Madrid career
before joining American club Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer.


Beckham, who was uncharactistically coy about showing off the
look on arrival at Real's training ground as he hurried inside,
has gone through a range of tonsorial metamorphoses in his four
years in Spain.


Most notable was the "samurai" look with which he wowed Asian
fans on first joining the club during an Asian pre-season tour.


Now a fashion icon as much as a footballer in this the twilight
of his career, the 31-year-old has changed his hairstyle ten
times in his four years at Real according to a count by sports
newspapers AS and Marca.


Both papers gave front page coverage to the news that the former
England man has again spent time at the hairdressers.


Beckham, who turns 32 on Wednesday, is set to play in Sunday's
encounter at Athletic Bilbao as Real chase hard in the final
furlong for the league title.


They trail leaders Barcelona by just two points with seven games
to go and Beckham therefore has a real chance of finally winning
something with the Spanish giants.


Beckham's new look is similar to the one sported by Valencia
goalkeeper Santiago Canizares, who Beckham helped to bamboozle
last weekend with the freekick from which Real defender Sergio
Ramos headed home the clincher in a  2-1 victory.
