Japan's Supreme Court ruled Friday that two Chinese women had no
right to state compensation for being kidnapped and raped by
Japanese soldiers during World War II.


The court, upholding a lower court decision, accepted they had
been raped, but said their right to reparation ended when Japan
and China normalised their diplomatic ties in 1972, when Beijing
renounced claims for war damages.


The ruling came hours after the top court used the same reason in
rejecting demands from individual Chinese for compensation from
Japan after being forced to work as labourers in Japan during the
war.


In this specific case, the two women from the northern province
of Shanxi were abducted and repeatedly raped by Japanese soldiers
in 1942, according to the ruling.


They had been seeking 46 million yen (390,000 dollars) in
damages. One of the women died in 1999 and her family carried on
the lawsuit.
