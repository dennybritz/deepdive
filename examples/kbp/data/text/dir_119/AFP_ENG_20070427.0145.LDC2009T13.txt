Norwegian oil group Statoil on Friday made a two billion US
dollar bid to acquire all shares of the Canadian North American
Oil Sands Corporation (NAOSC), Statoil said in a statement.


The companies entered into an acquisition agreement whereby
Statoil will purchase all shares of NAOSC at a price of 20
Canadian dollars per share.


Statoil said it expected the transaction to be finalised by the
end of the second quarter.


"The total transaction value is approximately 2.2 billion
Canadian dollars, equivalent to two billion US dollars," the
statement said.


According to Statoil the board of directors of NAOSC unanimously
approved the offer recommending its shareholders to accept the
bid. The three principal shareholders, Paramount Resources, ARC
Financial Corporations and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan have
agreed to tender all of their shares to the offer. Together they
represent 69 percent of the group.


In December 2006, Statoil announced the merger with Norwegian oil
and gas company Norsk Hydro.


Calgary based NAOSC was formed in 2001 and specializes in oil
sands leases.


The Statoil share was down by 1.61 percent to 168 kroner (22.66
euros, 28.11 US dollars) on the Oslo stock exchange in morning
trading, while the index was down 0.41 percent at 476.56 points
