The presidents of Poland and Ukraine on Friday signed a
cooperation roadmap for their countries' joint organisation of
the Euro 2012 football championships.


The accord, signed by President Lech Kaczynski for Poland and
Viktor Yushchenko for Ukraine, plots out bilateral cooperative
ventures in the run-up to the four- yearly continental soccer
finals and in economic, trade and humanitarian affairs.


Poland and its eastern neighbour Ukraine beat Italy and joint
bidders Hungary and Croatia to win the right to host the Euro
2012 tournament that will bring together Europe's 16 best
footballing nations.


It will be the first time that either Poland or Ukraine have
hosted a major football championship, and the two countries
pledged immediately after the announcement was made by UEFA in
Cardiff to do the necessary work to bring their infrastructure up
to scratch.


Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is the president's
identical twin, on Thursday named Poland's organising committee
for Euro 2012.


It is made up of 10 ministers in Kaczynski's government and is
led by the prime minister.


"To be effective, this kind of committee has to be made up of
members of the government," the Polish prime minister explained.
