Inter Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has undergone surgery in
the Netherlands to strengthen his abdominal wall, the recently
crowned Serie A champions said on Friday.


The 25-year-old Sweden international, who has been ruled out for
the remainder of the campaign with a groin injury, had been
putting off the operation until Inter wrapped up the title.


Ibrahimovic, who played a significant part in Inter's Scudetto
success with 15 league goals, will also miss the club's two-
legged Italian Cup final against Roma.


He is also likely to be ruled out of Sweden's 2008 European
championship qualifying matches in June against Denmark and
Iceland.
