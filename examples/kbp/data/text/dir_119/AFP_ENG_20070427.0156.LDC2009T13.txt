Legendary Russian cellist and emblem of resistance to the Soviet
system Mstislav Rostropovich died Friday, his spokeswoman told
AFP. He was 80.


"He died in hospital today," Natalya Dolezhal said.


Rostropovich had been ill for some time and had been receiving
treatment at a Moscow cancer clinic.


He was born in Baku and studied in Moscow under the celebrated
composers Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev. He went on to
a glittering international career, much of it spent abroad after
he was persecuted, then expelled in 1974 by the Soviet
authorities.


He was hospitalised in February for a reported operation on a
liver tumor and appeared pale and tired during television footage
of his 80th birthday celebrations in Moscow.
