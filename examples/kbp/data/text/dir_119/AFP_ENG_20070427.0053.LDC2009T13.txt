The leader of the Russian senate called Friday for breaking
diplomatic relations with Estonia in retaliation for the removal
of a Soviet war monument from central Tallinn.


"I urge you to adopt a resolution addressed to the president
recommending a break in diplomatic relations with Estonia,"
Sergei Mironov told the upper house of the Russian parliament.
