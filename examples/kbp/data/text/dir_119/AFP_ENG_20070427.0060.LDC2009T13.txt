The leader of the Russian senate called Friday for breaking
diplomatic relations with Estonia in retaliation for the removal
of a Soviet war monument from central Tallinn.


"I urge you to adopt a resolution addressed to the president
recommending a break in diplomatic relations with Estonia,"
Sergei Mironov told the upper house of the Russian parliament.


Russian lawmakers are due to vote on the non-binding resolution
on Friday.


In the Estonian capital overnight one person died and at least 43
were injured in a looting rampage and clashes with police after a
protest near the square where the statue of a Soviet Red Army
soldier once stood.


A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, Mikhail Kamynin,
called the Estonian government's actions "blasphemous" and
"inhuman," adding that Russia would re-examine its relations with
the ex-Soviet Baltic state.


The head of the international affairs committee in the lower
house of the Russian parliament, Konstantin Kosachyov, also
recommended tough measures against Estonia on Friday.


"We will of course demand from the executive the toughest
possible reaction to what is happening in Estonia," Kosachyov was
quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.


"It's barbaric, it's blasphemous," Kosachyov said.
