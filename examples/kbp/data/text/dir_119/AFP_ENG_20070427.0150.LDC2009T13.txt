China Southern Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, will join
the SkyTeam Alliance grouping of airlines before the end of 2007,
state media reported Friday.


Liu Shaoyong, general manager of China Southern, announced at an
aviation summit in the southern island city of Sanya that his
company would formally become a member of the SkyTeam Alliance
this year, the Xinhua news agency said.


The SkyTeam Alliance, formed in June 2000, is one of the world's
top three airline alliances, with members operating up to 15,000
daily flights. Among its 10 members are Air France, Korean
Airlines and Air Mexico.


China Southern Airlines signed a framework agreement with the
SkyTeam Alliance in August 2000, marking the first Chinese
airline to join an international air service alliance.


Air China, the nation's flag carrier, and another major airline
Shanghai Airlines have said they would join the rival Star
Alliance, the first and largest global passenger airline network
this year.
