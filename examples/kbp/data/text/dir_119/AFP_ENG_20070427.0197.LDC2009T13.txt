Parliamentary opponents of President Viktor Yushchenko seized the
initiative Friday in an ongoing power struggle, asking the
country's top court to dismiss his new order to dissolve
parliament.


A demand by 160 allies of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych to
reject the latest presidential decree "arrived at the court
today," court spokesman Ivan Avramov said.


The pro-Western Yushchenko has been locked in a stand-off with
supporters of the pro-Russian Yanukovych since April 2, when the
president first ordered the dissolution of parliament and early
elections.


Yanukovych has defied the order, and the president issued a
second decree on Thursday, pushing back the early election date
until June 24.


Analysts said Yushchenko was attempting to avoid a likely
constitutional court ruling against his first order.


About 1,500 Yanukovych supporters rallied in front of the court
on Friday, wrapping themselves in the blue flags of the prime
minister's Regions party.


One protester held a sign with an Orthodox icon and the words:
"Judge, don't sin!"


Yanukovych and Yushchenko have struggled for power since the 2004
presidential election, which was first granted to Yanukovych.
Suspicions of fraud prompted mass protests and a re-vote, which
Yushchenko won.
