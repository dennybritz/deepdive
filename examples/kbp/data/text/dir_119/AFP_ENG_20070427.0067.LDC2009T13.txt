France does not plan to stay in Afghanistan, Foreign Minister
Philippe Douste- Blazy said Friday, hours before a deadline for a
pullout of French troops in exchange for the release of two
hostages.


"There is no plan to continue occupying a country in the long
term," said Douste-Blazy, whose country has contributed 1,000 men
to the NATO force in the country. "It goes against France's
values of respect for sovereignty, national independence and
territorial integrity."
