A Palestinian security officer was shot dead by gunmen on Friday
after their relatives were told to wait in line at the border
terminal between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, medics and witnesses
said.


Abdelrahman Abu Teir, 24, sustained fatal wounds and four other
Palestinians were also wounded in the shootout.


The assailants opened fire after security officers tried to stop
their family members from barging straight into the terminal
rather than queuing up like hundreds of other would-be
travellers, witnesses said.


The Rafah crossing, the Gaza Strip's only route to the world that
bypasses Israel, has frequently been closed since Palestinian
militants killed two Israeli soldiers and seized a third in a
cross-border raid last June 25.


Each time the terminal opens, huge numbers of travellers flock to
cross into Egypt or return to the Gaza Strip in the other
direction.


Operation of the terminal is dictated by the Jewish state on
security grounds, despite Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip
in September 2005.


Since the terminal reopened two months later, the European Union
has deployed observers at Rafah at the request of the Palestinian
Authority and Israel, to monitor agreements on border traffic.
