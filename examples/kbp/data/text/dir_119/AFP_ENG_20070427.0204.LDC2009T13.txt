The world leading auto part company Bosch said on Friday that it
would bid to increase its control of its Indian subsidiary Motor
Industries Company (Mico) to strengthen its strategy in India.


Bosch said it would offer 4,000 rupees in cash per share in Mico
to increase its holding from 60.55 percent to about 80.0 percent
at a total cost of about 460 million euros (628.3 million
dollars).


The terms represent a premium of slightly more than 20 percent on
the average price of Mico shares during the last month and were
550 rupees higher than the closing price on Thursday.


Bosch chief executive Franz Fehrenbach said: "We want to increase
our interest in Mico to about 80 percent to strengthen further
our long-term commitment on the Indian market."


Bosch has been active on the Indian market for 80 years and has
made the Indian and Chinese markets a priority in the years
ahead.


Mico, which employs more than 10,000 people, achieved sales last
year of 37.8 billion rupees, or about 660 million euros.


The company makes various parts, including components for diesel
engines, starters and generators.
