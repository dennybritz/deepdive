Nigeria's president-elect Umar Yar'Adua said he would give
priority to tackling the crisis in the oil-rich Niger Delta that
has seen an upsurge in violence in recent months, his aides said
Friday.


"I have given my honour and pledge that all necessary steps must
be taken to protect the security of the Niger Delta because
security of the Niger Delta is the security of Nigeria," Yar'Adua
was quoted saying as late Thursday.


The president-elect, who will take over from outgoing President
Olusegun Obasanjo on May 29, assured community and opinion
leaders from the region that visited him in Abuja that his
government would facilitate the development of the area.


The Niger Delta, home to Nigeria's multi-billion dollar oil and
gas industry, has also seen an upsurge in militant attacks on oil
firms and personnel in the past two years.


Some 100 foreign workers, mostly in the oil sector, have been
kidnapped, but later released, while scores of Nigerian security
personnel have been killed by militant groups seeking a larger
share of the country's oil wealth for the local residents.


The unrest has reduced Nigeria's daily exports of 2.6 milllion
barrels of crude by 25 percent.
