Ecuador's President Rafael Correa accused the US oil giant Texaco
of causing an ecological disaster in the Amazon, while visiting a
region said to be ravaged by pollution from oil drilling.


"Let the whole world see the barbarity of this multinational,"
the fiery  leader said Thursday on a visit to the Sucmbios region
around the border of Ecuador and Colombia, where Texaco drilled
for crude from 1964 to the early 1990s.


He compared the environmental damage to that cause by the US
tanker Exxon Valdez which spilled 42 million liters (11 million
gallons) of crude in Alaska in 1989.


Texaco was made to pay 40 million dollars to Ecuador for
pollution caused by this spill, and indigenous communities have
also launched legal actions to demand billions of dollars in
compensation.


The Amazon basin region's four indigenous peoples -- the Siona,
the Huaorani, the Cofan, and the Shuar -- in 2003 took on Texaco
in the Ecuadoran courts, seeking reparation for alleged damage to
half a million hectares (1.24 million acres) of land.


They put the cost of cleaning up the region at six billion
dollars, but the company maintained it cleaned up after stopping
its activities there.
