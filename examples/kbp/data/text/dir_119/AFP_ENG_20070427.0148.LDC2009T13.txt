South Korea's Chinese-controlled Ssangyong Motor said Friday it
bounced back to profit in the first quarter of this year, driven
by brisk sales and cost reductions.


In the three months to March the company posted an operating
profit of 27.9 billion won (30.06 million dollars), reversing a
loss of 25.3 billion won in the same period a year earlier.


First-quarter net profit was 9.3 billion won, compared to a loss
of 23.3 billion won a year earlier. It was the first profit since
the second quarter of 2006.


Sales rose 14.9 percent year-on-year to 833.9 billion won.


"We have been able to turn profitable for the quarter, backed by
aggressive efforts to boost competitiveness starting last year,"
said Ssangyong president Choi Hyung-Tak.


The company sold 35,246 units, including 20,289 abroad, in the
three months to March, up 15.2 percent year-on-year.


China's Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation in 2004 took
over Ssangyong, South Korea's fourth largest automaker
specialising in sport utility vehicles and passenger sedans.
