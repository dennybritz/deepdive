Former Polish president and Nobel laureate Lech Walesa Friday
said Poland's ruling Kaczynski twins have "betrayed" the ideals
of the anti-communist Solidarity union and are endangering
democracy in his homeland.


"They have betrayed our ideals. And not just today and yesterday.
They began to betray them a few years ago," Walesa said in an
interview with the Italian daily La Repubblica.


Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for helping found
Solidarity, the first free trade union in the communist bloc,
accused Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his twin brother,
Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, of acting out of "their
personal desire for power and for their careers."


Walesa claimed this was "the main reason" for a new law which
requires lawmakers, academics and others to file a declaration
saying whether they collaborated with the communist-era secret
police or risk losing their jobs.


Polish EU lawmaker and former foreign minister Bronislaw Geremek
has refused to comply with the new law denoucing it as
humiliating and out of place in democratic Europe.


"Such a (political) climate deeply injures people who find
themselves accused. Now that (Polish) citizens are waking up,
they must get organized. In the future, they must make better
choices when they vote," Walesa said.
