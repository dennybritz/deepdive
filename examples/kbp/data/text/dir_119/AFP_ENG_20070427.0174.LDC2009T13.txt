Former world backstroke record holder Mai Nakamura announced her
retirement from competitive swimming on Friday because of
recurrent pains to her right shoulder.


"I feel relieved, although I can't think of my life without
swimming. I want to hand down the wonderful feelings you get from
the sport," Nakamura, the Sydney Olympic women's 100-metre
backstroke silver medallist, told reporters in her home town in
Nagaoka, north of Tokyo.


Nakamura set a 50m backstroke world record of 28.67 seconds at
the 2000 national championships, to become the first Japanese
swimmer in 28 years to set a world record.


Nakamura also held a world short course record of 58.45 in the
100m set in 2001, and won bronze in the 400m medley relay in the
2000 Olympics.


She had recently been overshadowed by Reiko Nakamura, no
relation, who took two bronze medals at the world championships
last month in Melbourne and went on to beat Mai's 100m Japanese
record at the nationals.
