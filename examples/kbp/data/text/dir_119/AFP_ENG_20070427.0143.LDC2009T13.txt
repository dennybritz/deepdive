Gunmen killed two police officers during an attempt to kidnap
foreign oil workers in the oil-rich southern Nigerian oil city of
Port Harcourt, police said Friday.


"Two gunmen attacked a security convoy accompanying the
expatriates to the office. They could not take the men away, but
I lost two of my officers in the incident," Rivers state police
commissioner Felix Ogbaudu told AFP.
