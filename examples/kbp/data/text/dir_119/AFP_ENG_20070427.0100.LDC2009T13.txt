An Iraqi detainee was assaulted and killed by fellow inmates at a
US-run prison facility in southern Iraq, the US military said on
Friday.


The detainee was declared dead on Thursday from "injuries
sustained by an apparent assault by other detainees," the
military said.


"An investigation is pending to determine the cause of death," it
added.


US and Iraqi forces are currently holding more than 19,000
detainees in facilities throughout Iraq, most without any formal
charges. Six detainees have been killed in prison brawls in the
past year alone, according to the US military.
