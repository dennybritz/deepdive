Seventeen servicemen died Friday when a Russian Mi-8 helicopter
carrying paratroopers was shot down in Chechnya, Russian news
agencies quoted military officials as saying.


The helicopter was shot down over the Caucasus mountains during a
battle with Chechen rebels, the Interfax and RIA Novosti news
agencies said in their reports, quoting unnamed officials at the
military's regional headquarters in the North Caucasus.


"There was a special operation early in the morning in which
federal forces clashed with a group of bandits. Reinforcements
were called for and three defence ministry helicopters arrived at
the scene. One of the helicopters, according to preliminary
information, was shot down while landing," RIA Novosti quoted the
headquarters source as saying.


Russian forces have fought two wars in the last 12 years against
a separatist rebellion in Chechnya, a tiny mountainous territory
home to the Muslim Chechens. An estimated 100,000 of the one
million Chechens have been killed and, according to official
figures, some 10,000 Russian servicemen.
