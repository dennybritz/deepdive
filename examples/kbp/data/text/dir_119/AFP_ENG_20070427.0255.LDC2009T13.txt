Pearson, the British publisher that makes about two thirds of its
revenue in the United States but states earnings in sterling,
warned Friday about its 2007 profits being hit by a weak dollar.


"Each five cent change in the average sterling/dollar exchange
rate for the full year would have an impact of approximately one
pence on adjusted earnings per share."


In a trading update, the publisher also of Penguin Books and the
Financial Times, said that in 2006 one pound was worth 1.84
dollars on average. During the first quarter of 2007 the exchange
rate rose to 1.96 dollars.


Despite the impact of a weak dollar, Pearson said the group was
trading in line with expectations for 2007.


"Our solid start to the year, make us confident that 2007 will be
another good year for Pearson," group chief executive Marjorie
Scardino said.


In early afternoon trade, the share price of Pearson was up 0.29
percent to 866.00 pence on London leading FTSE 100 index, which
was falling overall.
