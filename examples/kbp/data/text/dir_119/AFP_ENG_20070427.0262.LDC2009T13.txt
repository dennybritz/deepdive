British Prime Minister Tony Blair will not announce his
resignation before local elections next week, his official
spokesman said Friday, dismissing newspaper reports.


Blair's Downing Street office said the reports that he might step
down before the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and English
local elections next Thursday were "wrong."


Blair will clock up 10 years in power on Wednesday. He has
pledged to step down by September, but many commentators expect
him to announce a resignation date within weeks.


Speculation about when Blair could announce his resignation
timetable has centred on May 9, the day after the resumption of
power sharing in Northern Ireland, a key achievement of his time
in office.


Blair's governing Labour Party is set for a drubbing in next
week's local elections, according to opinion polls.


The Daily Telegraph said an early Blair resignation announcement
could be an attempt to limit the electoral damage, since his
unpopularty is so deep that it might actually improve Labour's
poll performance.


The British leader was in Poland Friday for talks focused on the
European Union's efforts to agree a new treaty, after the
rejection of an EU constitution by French and Dutch voters.
