France stands to net at least eight billion euros over four years
from the Rugby World Cup, according to a study commissioned by
the event's organisers.


The September 7-October 20 tournament, the sport's showpiece
four-yearly event, is expected to attract 350,000 foreign
visitors who will generate revenues of 1.5 billion euros, the
study by ESSEC said.


ESSEC said a further two billion euros would be generated by the
260 million viewers also expected throughout the six-week
tournament, notably at large organised big screenings of games.
Ticket sales will run to 250 million euros.


The study said a secondary boost would come in the form of 625
million euros per year over the coming four years from tourism
and 417 million euros from rugby- related economy, totalling over
four billion euros.
