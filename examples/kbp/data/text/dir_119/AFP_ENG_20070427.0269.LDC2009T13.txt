Amnesty International on Friday slammed the Iraqi government for
reinstating the death penalty, saying the "retrograde" decision
only "further brutalised" the country.


"As we know, the number of violent killings has grown" in Iraq,
Amnesty secretary general Irene Kahn told a news conference. "The
death penalty has only further brutalised the country," she
added.


Capital punishment was suspended after the US-led invasion of
Iraq in March 2003 and reinstated the following year by the
Baghdad government, she noted.


"The Iraqi justice system is incapable of holding a fair trial,"
she charged, adding that a death sentence there is the "ultimate
form of injustice."


She said the trial of Saddam Hussein was unfair and an exercise
in vengeance.


Iraq carried out at least 65 executions, including that of
Saddam, in 2006, according to Amnesty's annual report on capital
punishment unveiled by Kahn on Friday.


Iraq and five other countries -- China, Iran, Pakistan, Sudan and
the United States -- account for more than 90 percent of judicial
executions in 2006, the Amnesty report says.
