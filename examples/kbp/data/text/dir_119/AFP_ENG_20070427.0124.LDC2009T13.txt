Immigration to Israel is gradually declining, the country's
Immigrant Absorption Minister Zeev Boim told the Jerusalem Post
newspaper in an interview published on Friday.


The newspaper quoted Boim as saying that approximately 19,000 new
immigrants arrived in Israel last year, compared to the previous
three years, in which there were between 21,000 and 22,000
immigrants annually.


"The situation now for Jews all over the world has never been
better," Boim told the English-language daily.


He cited "no immediate physical danger to any Jewish community
abroad. So we do not see the same reasons for making aliya
(immigration to Israel) as we did in the last century.


"Almost all of the worldwide Jewish communities live under
democratic regimes. Most of these regimes are fighting anti-
Semitism, including France," he said.
