The Asian Development Bank said Friday it would step up aid to
areas in Pakistan hit by a deadly quake in 2005, with about 400
million dollars in previously pledged loans set to be released.


The ADB board will decide in June on the new soft loans, which
are to be used mainly in the rural housing and education sectors,
the Manila-based bank said in a statement, in which it also
announced it is opening an office in Muzaffarabad to help in the
rebuilding.


The bank pledged one billion dollars at a donor conference in
2005 to help Pakistan rebuild the hard-hit areas, and has so far
paid out almost 184 million dollars.


"We believe it is best to move ahead as fast as possible with our
earthquake assistance," ADB vice president Jin Liqun said.


The 7.6-magnitude earthquake in October 2005 killed some 74,000
people and displaced 3.5 million in northwestern Pakistan and
Kashmir.
