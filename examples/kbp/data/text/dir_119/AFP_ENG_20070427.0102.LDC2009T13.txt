The deadline for Taliban demands to be met in exchange for the
release of two French hostages will expire Saturday, the movement
has said.


The ultimatum was previously thought to expire Friday.


"The deadline is not today, the deadline finishes tomorrow,
Saturday," Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP.


The Taliban issued a statement April 20 saying it would give a
week for the French government to withdraw its troops from
Afghanistan and release Taliban prisoners.


"Without this, the position of Islamic Emirate (the Taliban)
about foreign prisoners was clear to the world and (will) soon be
applied," the statement on its website said.


The group has beheaded many of its other hostages, although
almost all of them have been Afghans.
