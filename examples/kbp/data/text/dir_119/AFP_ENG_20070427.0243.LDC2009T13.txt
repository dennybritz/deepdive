Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that a US anti-
missile system planned for deployment in eastern Europe would
greatly heighten the risk of mutual destruction, Interfax news
agency reported.


"The threat of causing mutual damage and even destruction
increases many times," Putin was quoted as saying after a meeting
with Czech President Vaclav Klaus in Moscow.
