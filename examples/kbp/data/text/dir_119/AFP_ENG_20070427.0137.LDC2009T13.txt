Taiwan's Acer Inc said Friday it posted a 40.8 percent increase
in net profit for the quarter to March on strong demand for
personal computers.


In the three month period, Acer registered net profit of 5.66
billion Taiwan dollars (170 million US), compared with 4.02
billion dollars a year earlier.


Acer, which claims to have replaced China's Lenovo Group as the
world's third largest PC vendor, posted 99.51 billion dollars in
sales in the quarter, up from 83.00 billion dollars a year ago.


According to information and technology reserach and advisory
firm Gartner Dataquest, Acer's PC market share in the first
quarter stood at 6.8 percent, higher than Lenovo's 6.3 percent.


Of Acer's first-quarter sales, notebook computers accounted for
62 percent, followed by desktop PCs at 17 percent and displays at
16 percent.


Other products, including servers, projectors and IA (information
appliance) devices took the remaining five percent.


The priority at this point for Acer will be to enhance its
operational efficiency, profitability and sustainability, company
chairman and chief executive officer JT Wang said.


Another area of high priority for the company will be to optimise
its balance sheet, Wang said.


Looking ahead, Wang said Acer is optimistic about the PC market
over the remainder of the year.


A more optimistic outlook for the second half is on the cards for
Acer with shipments and sales in the second quarter to June
likely to hold steady quarter- on-quarter and grow strongly year-
on-year, Wang said.
