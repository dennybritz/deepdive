South Korean pop star Rain, a pan-Asian heartthrob, has become
the first entertainer from his country to make People magazine's
annual "100 Most Beautiful People" list.


"I am very honoured. This will be a great boon to my efforts to
raise public awareness of me in the United States," Rain, 25, was
quoted as saying on his agent's website.


"I never expected this to happen to me. This is the best news for
me this year."


Since his debut in 2002 Rain, whose real name is Jung Ji-Hoon,
has personified the "Korean Wave" of pop music, films and TV
dramas sweeping across Asia.


Topping the list was former child star and "Charlie's Angels"
actress Drew Barrymore.


Others on the list include Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Oprah
Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Aniston,
Reese Witherspoon, Halle Berry and Jennifer Lopez.
