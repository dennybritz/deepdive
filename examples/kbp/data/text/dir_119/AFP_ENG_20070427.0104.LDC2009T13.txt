A consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland said Friday that
it wanted to make a formal offer for ABN Amro -- which could
spark a hostile takeover in the mammoth European battle for
control of the Dutch lender.


The RBS grouping, which also includes Banco Santander of Spain
and Dutch-Belgian group Fortis, said in an informal proposal on
Wednesday that it would pay 72 billion euros (98.4 billion
dollars) for ABN Amro.


That eclipsed a recommended bid from Barclays, made on Monday and
the preferred bidder for ABN management, which valued the Dutch
lender at 67 billion euros.
