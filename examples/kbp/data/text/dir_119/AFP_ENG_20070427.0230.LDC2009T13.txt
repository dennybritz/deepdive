The German parliament on Friday overwhelmingly approved extending
the mandate of the country's small military mission to Sudan's
strife-torn Darfur province by six months until November.


There are currently 39 unarmed German soldiers and five police
officers taking part in the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), but the
mandate allows for up to 75 German troops.


During the debate, politicians from all parties spoke out about
human rights abuses in Darfur.


UNMIS consists of 10,000 soldiers, of which 750 are observers,
and 700 police personnel.


According to the United Nations, about 200,000 people have been
killed and two million displaced in the four-year conflict in
Darfur that began as a rebellion and turned into a savage
conflict involving government forces, tribes and villagers.
