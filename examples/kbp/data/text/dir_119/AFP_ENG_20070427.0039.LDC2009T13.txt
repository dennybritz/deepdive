Authorities clamped a curfew on a northwestern Pakistani town
after two people were shot dead in the latest in a series of
sectarian killings, police said Friday.


Armed men on motorcycles fired at people sitting in an Internet
cafe in the town of Dera Ismail Khan late Thursday. One man died
on the spot and the other in hospital, senior police official Rab
Nawaz told AFP.


"The victims belonged to rival Shiite and Sunni Muslim sects and
the killings appear to be linked with Wednesday's shootings in
which three people were killed," Nawaz said.


Officials have blamed Wednesday's attacks on Sunni Muslim
militants.


Police imposed a curfew and sealed the town after Thursday's
shootings and paramilitary troops were patrolling the streets,
while the military has been put on alert, a police spokesman told
reporters.


The curfew would be relaxed from 1:00pm (0800 GMT) to 4:00pm for
traditional Friday prayers, he said.


The latest shootings came after eight people died in similar
attacks in Dera Ismail Khan and surrounding areas in March.


Sectarian violence between Pakistan's Sunni and Shiite
communities has claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late
1980s. Shiites account for about 20 percent of Pakistan's 160
million Sunni-dominated population.
