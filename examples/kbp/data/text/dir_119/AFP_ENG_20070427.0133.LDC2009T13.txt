Taliban fighters killed a district governor and his police chief
in southern Afghanistan but they have not captured the area,
police said Friday.


The attack late Thursday saw a further six policemen die at Giro
in the volatile eastern province of Ghazni, claimed a spokesman
for the Taliban, as others died in separate attacks across the
country.


"The district is in control of Taliban," spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi
told AFP.


But this was dismissed by an officer at the Ghazni police
headquarters.


"In a Taliban attack last night the district governor and
district police chief were killed, that is true," the officer
said on condition of anonymity.


"Since the district authorities have been killed, of course there
is a gap in power.


"But the Taliban are not in control of the district. The
provincial police headquarters are in an emergency meeting to
immediately appoint a new district chief and police chief with
some fresh forces and send them to the district."


In a separate attack, a detective and his brother were gunned
down in the eastern province of Khost Friday by men who opened
fire as they overtook their vehicle, Tani district governor
Dadiuzaman Sabari told AFP.


A police general in the southern province of Uruzgan said that a
further four policemen and six militants were killed in a
gunbattle on Wednesday that was sparked by a Taliban attack.
