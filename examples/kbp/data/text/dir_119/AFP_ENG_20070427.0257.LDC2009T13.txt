Hollywood star Richard Gere, ordered arrested by an Indian court
for kissing Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty, offered on Friday a
"sincere apology" for any offence he caused.


Gere's statement came a day after the court issued an arrest
warrant against him for "obscene" behavior for embracing Shetty
and planting several kisses on her cheeks during an AIDS
awareness event in New Delhi earlier this month.


"What is most important to me is that my intentions as an
HIV/AIDS advocate be made clear and that my friends in India
understand that it has never been nor could it ever be, my
intention to offend you," said Gere in the statement issued to
the Indian media.


"If that has happened, of course it is easy for me to offer a
sincere apology," said the actor, who is back in the United
States.


The incident triggered a public storm in India, known for its
chaste public behaviour despite Bollywood's sexually suggestive
song-and-dance routines.
