Mount Everest conqueror Sir Edmund Hillary has been released from
hospital, a spokeswoman for Auckland hospital said Friday.


The 87-year-old mountaineer and explorer was admitted on Sunday
after reportedly suffering a fall following his return from a
visit to Nepal.


Hillary, who with Sherpa Tenzing in 1953 was the first to reach
the peak of Everest, the world's highest mountain at 8,848 metres
(29,028 feet), has been in increasingly frail health in recent
years.


But that did not stop him visiting Nepal this month or returning
to Antarctica in January, where he led a mission to the South
Pole 49 years ago.
