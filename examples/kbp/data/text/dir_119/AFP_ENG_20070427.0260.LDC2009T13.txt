Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that a US anti-
missile system planned for deployment in eastern Europe would
greatly heighten the risk of mutual destruction, Interfax news
agency reported.


"The threat of causing mutual damage and even destruction
increases many times," Putin was quoted as saying after a meeting
with Czech President Vaclav Klaus in Moscow.


The Pentagon says the anti-missile system based partially in the
Czech Republic would be for defence only against minor military
powers such as Iran and could have no effect against Russia's
enormous missile arsenal.


However, Putin said the range of the system, which is designed to
shoot down overflying missiles, would extend right to the Ural
mountains, covering the European section of Russia.


"These systems will control Russian territory up to the Urals if
we do not take counter measures -- and we will do this," he
warned, according to Interfax.


Putin said that despite the row "we will develop relations with
all Europe, including the Czech Republic."


On Thursday Putin announced he was freezing Moscow's
participation in a Soviet- era defence treaty in response to the
planned US missile shield, which will require 10 interceptors
based in Poland and a radar tracker in the Czech Republic.


The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation expressed "grave concern"
at the move.


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice complained that Russia was
applying Cold War logic to the missile defence issue, and said
any suggestion the system was directed at Moscow was "ludicrous".
