The Bank of Japan on Friday slashed its forecast for Japanese
inflation in the fiscal year to next March to just 0.1 percent
but predicted a pick-up to 0.5 percent the following year.


The central bank had already cut its inflation forecast for the
current fiscal year in February from 0.8 percent previously as
the economy struggles to beat its long deflation scourge.
