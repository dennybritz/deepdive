Japan's economy is expected to grow at a steady pace of 2.1
percent over the next two years, the central bank said Friday.


Japan's economy also grew by 2.1 percent in the last fiscal year
to March 2007, missing the central bank's previous projection of
a 2.4 percent expansion, the Bank of Japan said in a twice-yearly
economic report.
