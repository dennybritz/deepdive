High-profile Chinese dissident Yang Jianli was released from a
Beijing jail Friday after serving a five-year sentence for spying
and illegally entering China, his lawyer said.


"He got out today," lawyer Mo Shaoping told AFP. "He is still
being deprived of his political rights so he cannot speak with
the press as he has no freedom to speak."


Chinese courts often strip people who have been jailed of their
"political rights," a punishment that can last longer than the
actual prison sentence.


Yang, a permanent US resident, was a former researcher at Harvard
University and a prominent democracy activist in China's exiled
dissident community.


He left China after being involved in the 1989 Tiananmen
democracy protests, and was subsequently banned from returning to
the country.


He re-entered China in 2002 with another person's passport in an
effort to document labour rights abuses in the country.


His jailing caused a diplomatic uproar, with the United States
and European governments urging President Hu Jintao and other top
leaders to immediately release him.
