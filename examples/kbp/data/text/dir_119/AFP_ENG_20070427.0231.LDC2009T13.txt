Outgoing French President Jacques Chirac will make a farewell
visit to Germany on Thursday for talks with Chancellor Angela
Merkel ahead of the second round of the French presidential
election.


"The chancellor is delighted that Mr Chirac will hold talks with
her before leaving his post," government spokesman Thomas Steg
said on Friday.


"The chancellor has greatly enjoyed working with Jacques Chirac
in whom she has found a trusted partner in European and
international politics," Steg said, adding that Merkel wanted to
express her thanks to Chirac in person.


With the departure of the 74-year-old Chirac from office, "a
great statesman and a committed European will be leaving the
stage," the spokesman added.


Both of the candidates in the second round of the French election
on May 6, the conservative Nicolas Sarkozy and the Socialist
Segolene Royal, held talks with Merkel in Berlin ahead of the
election.


Merkel, a conservative, has not commented on either of the
candidates.


Germany currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the
European Union.
