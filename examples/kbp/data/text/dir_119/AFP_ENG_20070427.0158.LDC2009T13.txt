The British diplomatic mission in Colombo  shed diplomatic
neutrality Friday to support Sri Lanka's cricket team in their
World Cup final against Australia.


The top British envoy here, Dominick Chilcott, led high
commission (embassy) staff in signing greetings to skipper Mahela
Jayawardene and his team-mates ahead of Saturday's game in
Barbados.


"The British High Commission wish the Sri Lankan cricket team the
best of luck in Saturday's cricket World Cup final," the mission
said in a statement signed by all its staff.


"We're hoping for a repeat of the 1996 World Cup final result.
Come on you Sri Lankan Lions. Let's hear you roar," the message
said.


Chilcott, dressed in the Sri Lankan team's blue and yellow
T-shirt, raised his hands in the air with 52 staff members in
support of the Sri Lankan team.


Sri Lanka inherited cricket from Britain, which ruled the Indian
Ocean island from 1815 to 1948.


During the qualifying stage Sri Lanka beat England by two runs.
