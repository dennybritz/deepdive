Five Americans detained for staging an illegal demonstration at
Mount Everest base camp are still to be expelled from China, the
foreign ministry said Friday.


A statement issued by the ministry said that the Americans "will
be expelled," contradicting earlier comments by a ministry
official who said they had already been kicked out of the
country.


The Americans on Wednesday unfurled banners demanding a "free
Tibet" and protested against plans to take the Olympic torch to
the top of the mountain ahead of the 2008 Beijing Games,
according to US-based Students for a Free Tibet.


An official with the group in Kathmandu, said she was unaware of
the whereabouts of the five.
