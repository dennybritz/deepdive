Senior Kyrgyz opposition figure Omurbek Suvanaliyev was formally
charged on Thursday in connection with unrest in the capital last
week and faces up to 10 years in prison, his lawyer said.


"Late Thursday evening in my presence investigators from the GKNB
officially presented charges against Suvanaliyev," his lawyer,
Tatyana Chinikina, told AFP, using the acronym for the Kyrgyz
security services.


"He was accused of organizing mass disturbances. If he is found
guilty by the court, he risks eight to 10 years in prison,"
Chinikina said.


Suvanaliyev is chief of staff at the opposition United Front for
a Decent Future for Kyrgyzstan and a former interior minister.


Last week demonstrations against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev
descended into violence as thousands of people gathered outside
his office and rocks and bottles were hurled at the building.


Police responded with tear gas and flares.


Strategically located on China's western edge and host to US and
Russian airbases, Kyrgyzstan has experienced regular
demonstrations and unrest since president Askar Akayev was ousted
in an uprising in 2005.
