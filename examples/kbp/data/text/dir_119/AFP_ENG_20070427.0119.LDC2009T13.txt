Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung is in the United States
for a check-up on his knee but reports that he could be sidelined
for a year are exaggerated, the club's chief executive said
Friday.


The South Korean injured his right knee in an English Premier
League match against Blackburn Rovers on April 1.


Chief executive David Gill said United would have to wait and see
how long Park's recovery takes. While describing media reports of
a one-year layoff as exaggerated, he declined to say how much
time will be needed.


Park signed with the club from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in 2005
after helping his national team reach the semi-finals of the 2002
World Cup.


Gill was speaking at a press conference during a visit to discuss
a friendly match with FC Seoul in July.
