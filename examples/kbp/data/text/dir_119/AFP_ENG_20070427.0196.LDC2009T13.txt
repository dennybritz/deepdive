Leading Spanish bank Santander Central Hispano (SCH), involved in
a huge bid move against ABN Amro, reported a big increase in
profits on Friday.


SCH said that net profit in the first quarter had surged by 20.7
percent on a 12-month basis to 1.8 billion euros (2.5 billion
dollars), in line with analysts' expectations.


The quarterly profit marked a record for the bank which has
interests in continental Europe, in Britain via Abbey National
bank which it acquired in 2004, and in Latin America.


The bank said that its margins had increased strongly and that
the results from all regions had risen sharply.


SCH, Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis, and Royal Bank of Scotland,
repeated on Friday that they wanted to make a bid of 72.0 billion
euros, the biggest ever in the banking sector, for Dutch bank ABN
Amro.


This is a head-on challenge to an agreed offer from Barclays of
Britain worth 67.0 billion euros.


Barclays is believed to want to merge the two banks'
international operations to create a world giant and the second-
biggest bank in Europe. The RBS-SCH-Fortis consortium is thought
to want to break up ABN Amro.


In both cases, a key asset is ABN Amro's US business, LaSalle
bank.
