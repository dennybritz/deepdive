A strong 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's Aceh Friday,
seismologists said, sparking panic in the province.


Residents fled their homes as the offshore quake hit at 3:02 pm
(0802 GMT), shaking provincial capital Banda Aceh and other
districts for about 30 seconds, a witness said on ElShinta radio.


The earthquake was centred 70 kilometres (43 miles) southwest of
Banda Aceh at a depth of 30 kilometres, the Indonesian
meteorological agency said.


Indonesia was the nation worst hit by the earthquake-triggered
Asian tsunami in December 2004, which killed some 168,000 people
in Aceh province alone.


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire,
where continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and
volcanic activity.
