Russian President Vladimir Putin described the death of legendary
Russian cellist and democratic hero Mstislav Rostropovich on
Friday as "a terrible loss," Russian news agencies reported.


"This is a terrible loss for Russian culture," Putin said at a
press conference, expressing his condolences for the deaths of
both Rostropovich and celebrated Russian actor Kirill Lavrov.


"Two mournful events have happened, two leading figures have
passed away, Kirill Lavrov and Mstislav Rostropovich. I offer by
deepest and sincerest condolences to their relatives and loved
ones," Putin said.


Rostropovich, who had a stellar musical career and became a
powerful emblem of resistance to the Soviet communist system,
died on Friday at a Moscow cancer clinic at the age of 80.


Lavrov became famous in Soviet times as a theatre and cinema
actor with his roles as an honest hero. He was the director of a
major theatre in Saint Petersburg.
