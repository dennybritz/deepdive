Armed Basque separatist group ETA has made a renewed written
threat to extort protection money from businesses in the northern
Spanish region, sources of Basque employers' federation Confebask
told AFP on Friday.


A Confebask spokeswoman confirmed a report in Basque newspaper El
Correo to that effect but said she could not go into "further
detail."


ETA has long demanded that Basque businesses pay what it calls a
"revolutionary tax" to help fund its activities, but more
recently had changed its terminology to speak instead of
"contributions" for "national construction".


According to El Correo, the group had demanded "between 180,000
and 300,000 euros (245,000-400,000 dollars), an amount
substantially above that claimed to date."


El Correo said last month that various firms had reported
receiving extortion letters.


ETA has been blamed for 819 deaths in a four-decade campaign to
achieve independence for the Basque region of Spain and the
Basque part of southwestern France.


In March last year it declared a permanent ceasefire but then
killed two Ecuadoran men in a December 30 bombing at Madrid
airport.
