France does not plan to stay in Afghanistan, Foreign Minister
Philippe Douste- Blazy said Friday, hours before a deadline for a
pullout of French troops in exchange for the release of two
hostages.


"There is no plan to continue occupying a country in the long
term," said Douste-Blazy. "It goes against France's values of
respect for sovereignty, national independence and territorial
integrity."


France has contributed 1,000 men to the NATO-led force in
Afghanistan, as well as Rafale fighter jets in support of the
international force battling a Taliban insurrection.


Taliban militants are holding two aid workers for the French
nongovernment organisation Terre d'Enfance (A World For Our
Children), who went missing on April 3 with three of their Afghan
staff.


The deadline for Taliban demands to be met in exchange for the
release of two French hostages will expire Saturday, not Friday
as originally thought, Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP.


Unless its demands are met, the Taliban, which has beheaded
several of its captives, has said "the position of Islamic
Emirate (the Taliban) about foreign prisoners... (will) soon be
applied."


"We are doing everything in Kabul and Paris to being them home
soon," Douste- Blazy said, adding that he had "taken note" of a
Taliban statement on Thursday saying the hostages were in good
health.
