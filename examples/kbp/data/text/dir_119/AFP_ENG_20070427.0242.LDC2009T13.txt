The Dutch intelligence service said the terrorism threat for the
Netherlands eased off in 2006, in its annual report presentation
Friday, days after the country lowered its alert level.


"There is a decrease of the acute threat from home grown
terrorism networks," intelligence service AIVD director Sybrand
van Hulst said.


"However, the chance that a terrorist attack will take place in
the Netherlands remains conceivable," he added.


On Wednesday the Dutch justice ministry announced that the
terrorism alert level was lowered from "substantial" to
"limited".


The AIVD annual report said home-grown terrorism networks posed
less of a threat because of a successful police crackdown on
terrorism suspects and internal disagreement and a lack of strong
leadership. Van Hulst said there are an estimated 10 to 20
radical Muslim networks active in the Netherlands.


The AIVD stressed that the process of radicalisation of Muslim
youths in the Netherlands was continuing.


"Radicalisation does not always lead to terrorism but it could be
a threat in itself because it could lead to inter-ethnic tensions
and a polarisation of Dutch society," the service said.


Last December four Islamic militants were sentenced to up to
eight years in prison for planning attacks on politicians and the
Dutch intelligence services. Mohammed Bouyeri, the leader of the
so-called Hofstad group network is serving a life sentence for
the 2004 murder of outspoken Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh.
