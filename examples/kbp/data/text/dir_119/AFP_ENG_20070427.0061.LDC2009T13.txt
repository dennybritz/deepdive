Israel's military on Friday denied claims by the Lebanese army
that an Israeli patrol had crossed into southern Lebanon one day
earlier.


"Our forces conducted Thursday a routine patrol south of the
international Israeli-Lebanese border, and not in Lebanese
territory, and UNIFIL (UN Interim Force) confirmed that," a
military spokesman told AFP.


Israeli troops frequently operate south of the border, he said.


The Lebanese army had said a 10-member Israeli patrol crossed the
electronic fence on the Saddani hills between the towns of
Kfarshuba and Shebaa and entered up to 50 meters and 100 meters
(yards) into Lebanese territory.


A unit from the UN Interim Force intervened and forced the
Israeli patrol to withdraw, it said.


Asked about the incident, a UNIFIL officer told AFP "UNIFIL sent
technical experts to acertain the facts."


In February, Lebanese and Israeli troops exchanged fire across
the border for the first time in decades, after Israeli sappers
moved towards the border to clear unexploded ordnance.


A bolstered UN peacekeeping force has been patrolling the
volatile area with Lebanese soldiers since last year's 34-day war
between Israel and Shiite militia Hezbollah.
