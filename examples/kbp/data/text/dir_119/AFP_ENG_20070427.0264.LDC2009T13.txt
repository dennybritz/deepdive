Two Greek Orthodox nuns found murdered this week inside a 400
-year-old mountain nunnery in southern Greece were likely killed
in a violent robbery, but a three- day investigation has found
few clues, a local police officer said on Friday.


"By all appearances, it was a common robbery that went awry," a
local police officer told AFP.


The perpetrator or perpetrators made off with a small sum of
money and icon offerings, but there is no evidence to confirm
reports that a priceless 11th- century cross was also stolen, he
added.


Three days after the murders, no suspects have been named.


Police searched the monastery and interrogated a number of locals
but have so far uncovered no other clues, the officer said.


"We have no positive results so far, the investigation
continues," he said.


The nunnery's sole occupants, 86-year-old prioress Makrina and
sister Makaria, 63, were found on Tuesday in their night garments
on a bedroom floor at the 17th century nunnery of the Assumption
of the Virgin Artocosta in Arcadia, the eastern Peloponnese.


An initial forensic investigation suggested that the two women
were suffocated after putting up a fight.


The monastery gates were open and the premises had been rifled.


The police were alerted by pilgrims who visited the monastery.


Perched on high cliffs in isolated areas, Greek monasteries are
frequently targeted by robbers for valuable Orthodox icons and
other relics of Greece's rich Byzantine tradition, but also for
money left by pilgrims.


Originally a monastery until 1982, the Arcadian nunnery once
housed an icon of the Virgin and Child associated with miracles
which was taken to Venice in 1540.
