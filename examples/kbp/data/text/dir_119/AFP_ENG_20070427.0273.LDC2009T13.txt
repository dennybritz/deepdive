Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the Estonian
government of fomenting tensions between the two countries by
removing a Soviet war memorial from down town Tallinn overnight.


"We think this is a terrible situation," he said, describing as
"sacred" the monument to Soviet Red Army soldiers.


Lavrov, in a brief foray into English amid translation problems,
said that the Estonian government "spat on those things".


One person was killed in riots as the memorial was removed from
the centre of the Estonian capital under cover of darkness.


"It's the Estonian government that chose to make relations
abnormal," Lavrov said, after talks with his Norwegian
counterpart Jonas Gahr Stoere.


The Russian Senate has called for diplomatic relations with
Estonia to be broken off, while the Russian foreign ministry
called the movement of the memorial "blasphemous" and said
relations would be examined.


Ethnic Estonians see the statue of the Bronze Soldier as a symbol
of 50 years of Soviet occupation, while Russia considers it a
symbol of the fight against Nazism in World War II.
