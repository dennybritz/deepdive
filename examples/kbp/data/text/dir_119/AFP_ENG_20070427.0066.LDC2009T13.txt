The Bank of Japan on Friday slashed its inflation forecast for
the fiscal year to next March to just 0.1 percent but predicted a
pick-up to 0.5 percent the following year.


The central bank had already cut its inflation forecast for the
current fiscal year in February from 0.8 percent previously as
the economy struggles to beat its long deflation scourge.


But the slower than expected pick-up in consumer prices would not
derail the overall recovery, with the economy expected to grow
2.1 percent annually over the next two years, the BoJ added.


Consumer price inflation is "currently somewhat weaker than
previously projected, mainly due to the fall in crude oil
prices," the BoJ said in a twice- yearly economic report.


Inflation was "likely to be around zero percent in the short run
depending on developments in crude oil prices but is expected
gradually to rise in the longer run," it added.


Economists say current tepid price pressures may not deter the
BoJ from raising interest rates once or even twice more this year
as it is concerned that an overly loose monetary policy will
store up trouble for the future.


The BoJ earlier Friday left its key interest rate unchanged at
0.5 percent for the third meeting in a row as expected against a
backdrop of lingering deflationary pressures.


The decision came just hours after the government said Japan's
core consumer prices fell by a bigger-than-expected 0.3 percent
in March, down for a second straight month.


The central bank last raised interest rates in February, by a
quarter point, which was the first increase since July when the
BoJ ended more than five years of virtually free credit.
