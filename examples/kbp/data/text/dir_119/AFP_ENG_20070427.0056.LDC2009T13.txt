Four people were killed and three wounded early Friday when
rockets fired by suspected militants hit a house in a Pakistani
tribal area bordering Afghanistan, officials said.


The incident happened at Saidgi village in the North Waziristan
tribal district, around four kilometres (2.5 miles) from the
frontier, a security official told AFP.


"Four people were killed and three others were injured when a
rocket hit an outhouse for guests belonging to a tribesman called
Habib Khan around 3:30 am," the official said on condition of
anonymity.


Another four rockets caused damage to dozens of mud houses in the
same village and destroyed an electricity transformer and severed
power cables, he said.


Local administration officials said that they were investigating
the incident but it was not immediately clear whether the rockets
were fired from Afghanistan or Pakistan.


Pakistan signed peace deals with insurgents in North Waziristan
in 2006 and South Waziristan in 2005, prompting concerns from
NATO, US and Afghan officials.
