Estonia's actions in moving a Soviet war monument from central
Tallinn to an undisclosed location overnight were "blasphemous"
and "inhuman," the Russian foreign ministry said Friday.


In the Estonian capital overnight one person died and at least 43
were injured in a looting rampage and clashes with police after a
protest near the spot where the statue of a Soviet Red Army
soldier had stood.


"Once again we can characterize the actions of official Tallinn
as blasphemous and inhuman, especially considering that the
monument was taken down ahead of Victory Day" on May 9, Interfax
quoted Russian foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin as
saying.


"The actions of the Estonian authorities cause regret and cannot
be justified," Kamynin was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying.


International organizations must look into the events in Tallinn
and "take the necessary steps to cool the zeal of the Estonian
authorities," Kamynin said.


"We will decide on our further actions in light of what has
happened in Tallinn," Kamynin said.
