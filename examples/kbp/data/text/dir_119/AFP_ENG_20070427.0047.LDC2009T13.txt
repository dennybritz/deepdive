Japanese share prices closed down 0.17 percent on Friday after
soft domestic economic data offset the impact of another record
finish on Wall Street, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
lost 28.76 points to close at 17,400.41.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares declined 2.41
points or 0.14 percent to 1,701.00.
