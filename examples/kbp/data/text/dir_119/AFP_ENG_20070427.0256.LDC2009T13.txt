The run-up to next year's Olympic Games in Beijing offers an
opportunity to "bring more attention and scrutiny" to China's
human rights record, Amnesty International said Friday.


"China continues to be the world's top executioner," the rights
organisation's secretary general Irene Kahn told a news
conference as she unveiled Amnesty's annual report on capital
punishment.


"We hope the Olympics will bring more international attention and
scrutiny to the practice of the death penalty in this country,"
Kahn said.


China's human rights record, not only concerning capital
punishment but also freedom of expression and other issues, is
"so contrary to the spirit of the Olympics," she added.


China accounted for 1,051 of 1,591 worldwide executions last
year, according to unofficial figures, although Amnesty estimates
the true figure to be between 7,000 and 8,000.


Crimes such as bribery and corruption are punishable by death in
China, Kahn noted.


She said however that "even in China there is a glimmer of hope,"
pointing to a judicial review that is expected to lead to a
reduction in death sentences.


"China is clearly under pressure," she said.
