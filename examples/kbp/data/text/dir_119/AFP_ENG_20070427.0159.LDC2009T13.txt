The head of the Association of Surfing Professionals Friday said
it was time the sport made its Olympic debut to reflect youth
culture in the new millennium.


Wayne Bartholomew, a former world champion who pushed for
surfing's inclusion at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, said some of the
sports on the Olympic program were no longer relevant.


"I led the bid for surfing's inclusion at the 2000 Olympics. I
learned a lot of lessons in that, it does get very political," he
told reporters here.


"But it is time for the Olympic body to have a look at what youth
are doing today in the new millennium, what sports are really
relevant.


"Are sports from 60 years ago truly relevant in the world today?


"And the thing is (surfing) easily follows the criteria. There's
over 100 nations that surf, it is truly a global sport."


The Olympics currently has 28 events.
