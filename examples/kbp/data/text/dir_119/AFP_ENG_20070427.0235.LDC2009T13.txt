Dutch shareholders have launched legal action against bank ABN
Amro, at the centre of a massive European takeover battle, to
stop the bank selling its US subsidiary LaSalle, an Amsterdam
court said Friday.


The Dutch shareholder's association VEB is demanding that
shareholders be allowed to vote on the proposed sale of LaSalle,
a key asset in the takeover battle.


The business chamber of the Amsterdam court of appeal will hold a
public hearing on the claim Saturday which could lead to a full
blown court case.


On Monday ABN Amro and British bank Barclays announced that they
had agreed to a takeover and announced the sale of its US bank
LaSalle to Bank of America for 21 billion dollars ( billion
euros) as part of the deal.


On Wednesday a consortium of three banks led by Royal Bank of
Scotland proposed a rival bid pitched at 39 euros per share --
compared with Barclays' offer of 36.25 euros -- and was dependent
on ABN's US subsidiary LaSalle not being sold.


ABN Amro held a shareholders meeting Thursday but there was no
vote on the sale of LaSalle or on the takeover bids by the rival
banks.


ABN Amro maintains that it does not have to ask its shareholders
approval for the sale of the American bank because it would not
constitute a "major change" in the bank's identity.
