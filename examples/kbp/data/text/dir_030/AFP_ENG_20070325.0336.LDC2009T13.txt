The death toll from a cyclone that slammed into northern
Madagascar more than a week ago has risen to 80, the Indian Ocean
island's authorities announced Sunday.


In addition, more than 105,000 people were made homeless, said
Jacky Randriaharison, head of emergency coordination.


He said the figure may rise again as reports continue to come in
from isolated areas cut off by blocked roads and rising water.


He said final figures should be known in two or three days.


The cyclone, named Indlaha, hit the north of the island between
March 15 and 17. It is by far the deadliest of the six cyclones
to have hit Madagascar so far this season, which began in
December.


Three years ago cyclone Gafilo left 241 people dead in the island
of 18 million.
