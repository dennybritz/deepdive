The Republic of Ireland received a double boost ahead of
Wednesday's crucial Euro 2008 qualifier at home to Slovakia with
the news on Sunday that goalkeeper Shay Given and goalscoring
hero Steven Ireland should be fit.


Given suffered a knee injury during their 1-0 Group D win over
Wales on Saturday - in which Ireland scored the only goal just as
he had done in the unimpressive 1-0 win over San Marino earlier
this year.


Given injured his knee while holding off a Craig Bellamy charge
in the first half but the knock is not thought to be as serious
as first thought and the 30 -year-old is likely to be back in the
fold for Wednesday's encounter at Croke Park.


Ireland hobbled off the pitch during Saturday's game suffering
from a thigh strain.


However the 20-year-old midfielder says he will "play through the
pain barrier" when it comes to kick-off on Wednesday.


"I've a great chance of playing. I'm having a scan to double-
check things but it's not as severe as it was yesterday," said
the Manchester City midfielder.


"I'm receiving a lot of treatment, hot towels and I've been in
for an ice bath. I should be okay for training tomorrow.


"I'm desperate to be involved as these are once-in-a-lifetime
opportunities and you don't want to miss out.


"I can play through the pain barrier. A lot of players can, so
I'm willing to do that and go again."


Irish skipper Robbie Keane is suspended for the game with
Reading's Kevin Doyle likely to replace him.


The Republic of Ireland are third in Group D, three points behind
leaders Germany, who have played a game less.


Slovakia lie in fourth place just one point behind The Republic
of Ireland and also with a game in hand.
