Mike Bibby nailed a club-record nine 3-pointers en route to 37
points Sunday as the Sacramento Kings posted an emotional 107-100
victory over the Phoenix Suns.


The Kings, battling injuries and inconsistent play as they
struggled to stay in the National Basketball Association playoff
race, claimed just their second win in the last 10 games.


Bibby shot 13-of-23 from the field, including 9-of-12 from the
arc, breaking Mitch Richmond's mark set on February 25, 1994.


With the win, Sacramento improved to 30-40 and moved four games
behind the eighth-place Los Angeles Clippers 34-36.


With the star guard on fire, Arco Arena lived up to its
reputation as one of the most intimidating home courts in the
NBA.


After Shawn Marion's dunk cut the Suns' deficit to two, Bibby
nailed back-to- back 3-pointers to make it 104-96 with 38 seconds
left - sending the crowd into a frenzy.


Ron Artest had 24 points and nine rebounds and John Salmons added
17 points for Sacramento, which shot 52 percent.


Leandro Barbosa scored 27 points and Amare Stoudemire collected
23 and 11 rebounds for the Suns, who lost for just the third time
in their last 11 games.


The Suns are now 52-17, six games behind Dallas or the top spot
in the Western Conference and the NBA's best record.


Earlier in the day Dallas posted their sixth straight victory, a
104-97 triumph over Atlanta.
