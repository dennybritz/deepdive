Iran is to restrict its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog
in reaction to Security Council sanctions over its disputed
atomic programme, a government spokesman announced on Sunday.


"Iran has decided to partially limit its cooperation with this
agency until the Iranian nuclear file is transferred from the
Security Council" back to the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), said Gholamhossein Elham.


The spokesman, quoted on the state news agency IRNA, explained
that the Islamic republic had accepted four years ago an
arrangement whereby it would inform the IAEA of any decision to
construct a new nuclear installation.


But it would no longer inform the agency of new installations
until six months before they are brought into service, he said.
