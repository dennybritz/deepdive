Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein leaders are likely to
meet later on Monday ahead of a midnight deadline on restoring
power sharing in Northern Ireland, DUP and British government
sources told AFP.


"Our approach is to get to the point where the parties engage
directly. My sense is that is the case, and that it will happen,"
said the government source.


"Things look reasonably okay. The logistics have to be
finalised," said the DUP source of holding a first-ever meeting
between DUP and Sinn Fein leaders ahead of the midnight (2300
GMT) deadline to restore the devolved assembly at Stormont or
have the province ruled from London indefinitely.


The Protestant DUP, which favours remaining part of Britain, on
Saturday agreed to form an executive with its long-standing
Catholic rivals Sinn Fein, who want union with the Republic of
Ireland, but wants six weeks to overcome outstanding hurdles.


The DUP source said that a number of issues will be discussed at
the meeting, including the programme for government and finances.
The DUP will also want to test Sinn Fein's commitment to the
Police Service of Northern Ireland, the source said.
