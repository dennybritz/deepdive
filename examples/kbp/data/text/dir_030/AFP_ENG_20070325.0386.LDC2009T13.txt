Armenian Prime Minister Andranik Margarian, leader of the ruling
Republican party, died of a heart attack on Sunday, the
president's office said in a statement.


"Margarian died suddenly at his home today in the 56th year of
his life as a result of a heart attack... President Robert
Kocharian has called an emergency government meeting," the
statement said.


Margarian had been in office in this former Soviet republic since
2000. Previously he was a parliamentary deputy in the 1990s and
served in different government departments during the Soviet era.


A trained engineer, Margarian was arrested for anti-Soviet
dissident activity in 1974 and sentenced to two years in prison,
according to his official biography.


"I see two possibilities," said Alexandr Iskandarian, the
director of the Caucasus Media Institute, an Armenian think-tank.


"Either the president chooses a temporary prime minister who will
be replaced after the May 12 legislative elections, or he opts
for a strong personality who will have every chance of being kept
on by the new parliament."


He said he thought the first option was more likely.
