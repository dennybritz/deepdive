European Union monitors at the Rafah border crossing caught a
Palestinian woman trying to sneak into the Gaza Strip with three
live crocodiles strapped to her stomach, a spokeswoman said on
Sunday.


The young crocodiles, each about 40 centimetres (15.5 inches)
long were taped to the woman beneath a loose fitting robe, said
Maria Telleria Chavarri, spokeswoman for the EU mission at the
Rafah border crossing connecting Egypt and the Gaza Strip.


"The crossing monitors suspected her because she was so fat and
they searched her, discovered the crocodiles and arrested her,"
Telleria Chavarri said.


The woman, who was stopped last week, told border guards she
intended to sell the crocodiles to Gaza City zoo.


In the past, EU border guards have stymied attempts to smuggle
exotic birds and even a tiger across the border, added Telleria
Chavarri.


"It's illegal to smuggle such animals. Crocodiles are a protected
under UN regulations," she added.
