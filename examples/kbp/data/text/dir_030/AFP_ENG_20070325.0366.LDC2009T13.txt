Troubled Sacramento Kings forward Ron Artest has told teammates
he wants to retire following this National Basketball Association
season, ESPN reported Sunday.


Citing unnamed club sources, the US sports television network
said Artest would not comment on the report, saying only, "We can
talk about it after playoffs."


The Kings have reached the playoffs eight years in a row but are
far from assured of a place this season, 4 1/2 games out of a
Western Conference playoff spot at 29-40 with five teams to pass
to qualify.


Artest, averaging 18.7 points and 6.6 rebounds a game, has missed
three games since being arrested March 5 following a domestic
dispute involving his wife.


Artest, 27, pleaded innocent Thursday to four misdemeanor charges
and was ordered to remain 100 yards away from wife Kimsha and
their three children, although he can communicate with them.
Another hearing is set for April 5.


After serving a record-setting 73-game suspension for his role in
sparking a melee between spectators and Indiana Pacers players
during a game at Detroit, Artest had also mentioned retirement.


He would be walking away from a contract that pays him two more
seasons at 7.4 million dollars each, although he has the option
to end the deal and become a free agent after next season.
