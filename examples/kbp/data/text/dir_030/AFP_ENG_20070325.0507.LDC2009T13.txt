Mexico's Lorena Ochoa squandered a big lead but bounced back to
claim her first victory of 2007 at the 1.5 million-dollar Safeway
International on Sunday.


The 2006 LPGA Player of the Year, Ochoa overcame a six-stroke
swing to claim the title.


After winning six tournaments last season, Ochoa claimed her 10th
career title with a final round 68, beating Norwegian Suzann
Pettersen by two strokes.


Ochoa had a four-day total of 18-under 270.


Ohoa, 25, led by four strokes entering the final round but fell
two behind Pettersen when the Norwegian struck early with four
birdies in a row from the second.


Ochoa bounced back with four birdies in five holes from the 14th
on to rally for the victory and head into the first major of the
season, next week's Kraft Nabisco Championship in California, on
a high note.


Ochoa threw away this title with a terrible finish two years ago,
but she managed not to do the same thing again.


"Suzann played great, but I'm just delighted to win," Ochoa said.
"When she got ahead I knew I had to stay patient and hope the
putts would fall."


One ahead playing the par-five 18th, Ochoa sealed the victory
with a birdie.


Pettersen, seeking a first US LPGA title and a second
professional victory alongside the 2001 French Open, had a 66.


American Laura Diaz (67) and South Korean Jeong Jang (72) shared
third at 10-under.


Two-time winner Annika Sorenstam (71) tied for eighth at 7-under.
