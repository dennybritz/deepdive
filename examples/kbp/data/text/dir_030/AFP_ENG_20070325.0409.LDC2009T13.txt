Gunfire and explosions were heard near Sri Lanka's only
international airport early Monday, officials and residents said.


Firing and several blasts were heard near the Bandaranaike
international airport, about 35 kilometres (21 miles) north of
here, military officials in Colombo said.


"We are also checking on the reports of gunfire," a spokesman for
the military said.


The airport was attacked by Tamil Tiger rebels in July 2001, who
destroyed six civilian jets after wrecking more than a dozen
military aircraft at the adjoining airbase.
