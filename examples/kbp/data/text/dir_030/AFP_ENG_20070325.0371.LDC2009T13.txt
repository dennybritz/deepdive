Admiral William Fallon has arrived in Iraq for his first visit
since being appointed head of US Central Command which overseas
American military operations in the Middle East, a spokesman said
on Sunday.


"I can confirm that he's in Iraq. This is his first trip since
taking command at US Central Command," Lieutenant Colonel
Christopher Garver told AFP, saying that Fallon would be meeting
government and military leaders.


The Iraqi defence ministry said Fallon and Iraqi Defence Minister
Abdel Qader Jassim Mohammed met in Baghdad for talks about
security on Sunday.


They discussed a continuing operation launched by US and Iraqi
troops last month in a bid to quell violence in Baghdad, and
security concerns in the provinces of Al-Anbar, Basra, Diyala and
Nineveh, the ministry said.


Fallon this year replaced General John Abizaid as head of the
Central Command, which oversees US forces from North Africa to
Central Asia and is in charge of running the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq.


A former head of American forces in the Pacific, Fallon was a
navy combat pilot during the Vietnam War, commanded an attack
squadron during the 1991 Gulf War and was involved in NATO's
Operation Deliberate Force in Bosnia.
