A number of swimmers have complained about the water quality and
visibility in the pool being used for the world championships,
with the pool's maker investigating, a report said Monday.


"It's pretty dark out there and the water is pretty murky, so it
surprised me a bit when I dived in," Australian breaststroker
Brenton Rickard was quoted as saying in the Melbourne Age
newspaper.


His teammate Michael Klim added: "My goggles were murky too. I
don't know if it was the pool or the goggles."


Championship organisers said they had asked the pool's makers,
AstralPool, to investigate.


"We have listened to what the feedback has been from a couple of
the athletes, and we have asked AstralPool to look at it,"
Melbourne 2007 spokesman Damien Glass said.


The pool is a temporary structure inside the Rod Laver Arena,
usually home to the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam, and was
filled with 6.8 million litres of water just before the
championships.


It is suspended above centre court where Roger Federer and Serena
Williams won Australian Open titles in January.
