Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein leaders are likely to
meet later on Monday ahead of a midnight deadline on restoring
power sharing in Northern Ireland, DUP and British government
sources told AFP.


"Our approach is to get to the point where the parties engage
directly. My sense is that is the case, and that it will happen,"
said the government source.


"Things look reasonably okay. The logistics have to be
finalised," said the DUP source of holding a first-ever meeting
between DUP and Sinn Fein leaders ahead of the midnight deadline
to restore the devolved assembly at Stormont or have the province
ruled from London indefinitely.
