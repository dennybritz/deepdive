France coach Raymond Domenech on Sunday hit out at criticism of
his side's unimpressive 1-0 win over Lituania in their Euro 2008
qualification match saying the circumstances were far from easy.


Playing on a far-from-perfect pitch and with some notable players
absent from the ranks including the injured Thierry Henry,
Patrick Vieira, Franck Ribery and Louis Saha, it took a 73rd-
minute goal from Bolton's Nicolas Anelka to offer a reshuffled
France team the valuable three points.


"The aim is to qualify for Euro 2008. We had to carve out a win
over there (Lithuania), under difficult circumstances," said
Domenech.


"This team is built to win. The opposition forced us to fight
hard and we managed to get the upper hand of the battle
physically and win."


Domenech was also full of praise for his controversial and fiery
striker Anelka, who has played for eight clubs in eleven years.


"I have always got on well with him. I have never had any
problems, neither with his game nor his behaviour.


"I can't comment about the past, but when he plays his top level
during a match, and also scores, he fullfils everything we want
of him," concluded the France handler.


France occupy second place in Group B on the same number of
points as surprise group leaders Scotland and will play host to
Austria on Wednesday in a friendly.
