Argentine Daniel Vancsik became the fourth first-time winner on
the European Tour this month when he claimed victory in the
Madeira Islands Open on Sunday.


The 30-year-old hit seven birdies with three bogeys for a final
round 68 to finish seven shots clear with an 18 under par total
of 270.


South Africa's David Frost and Spaniard Santiago Luna, the 1995
winner here, finished joint second, with Dane Mads Vibe-Hastrup,
Scot Euan Little and Frenchman Christian Cevaer a further two
shots back.


Vancsik, who joins South African Anton Haig, China's Liang Wen-
chong and Thai golfer Chapchai Nirat in tasting maiden success on
the circuit in March, took the lead from the second round.


The Argentine began the final day four clear and five birdies in
a front nine 32 effectively clinched the title as Vibe-Hastrup
and Cevaer, second and third overnight, went out in 39 and 38.


The win is Vancsik's first European Tour top-10 finish.


He did not manage a single top-10 finish in 25 starts in his
first full season in Europe last year.


Defending champion Jean Van de Velde of France finished  32nd.
