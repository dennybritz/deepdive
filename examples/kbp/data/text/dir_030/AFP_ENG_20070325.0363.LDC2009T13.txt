Some 15,000 young people rallied in Moscow Sunday to pay tribute
to President Vladimir Putin -- and to be instructed on what they
could do in the event of a revolt against the government.


Wearing red hats and white jackets emblazoned with the name of
the Nashi organisation (Our People), they came from 75 different
Russian cities, Rossiya state television reported.


Organisers plan to give out mobile phone SIM cards to be
activated in case of an attempted revolt against Putin's rule,
Nashi spokeswoman Anastassia Suslova told AFP.


"You have to activate it if you hear a politician say that there
is an emergency, if there is an attempted rebellion in a region,
of if foreigners try to organise a revolution," she said.


Anyone activating such a SIM card would be sent instructions on
how to react, she added.


The SIM cards were reserved to those who could convince the
movement's officers that they were "active citizens."


The crowd gathered near the city centre after passing through a
cordon of soldiers equipped with metal detectors.


Young people were asked to send mobile phone text messages to
wish the president well, the organisation said in a statement.


A large screen is being installed in Moscow's Pushkin Square,
where some of the messages will be posted.


They are also to be collected in a book and given to the
president as a gift to thank him for his seven years in office.


"Russia has no enemies -- I would like everyone to understand
that," Vassili Yakemenko, head of the Nashi organisation, told
Rossiya television Sunday.


"It has competitors who would like what belongs to us to belong
to them," he added, apparently a reference to Russia's immense
oil and gas reserves.
