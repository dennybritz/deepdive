China will maintain the momentum of stable and fast economic
growth but adopt measures to avoid overheating, Chinese President
Hu Jintao said in remarks published in state press Monday.


"A comprehensive assessment of various factors shows that it is
fully possible for China's economy to maintain the momentum of
stable and fast growth," Hu said, according to the official
Xinhua news agency.


China's economy expanded by 10.7 percent in 2007, the fourth
consecutive year of double-digit growth, underpinned by massive
investment in fixed assets and a booming trade surplus.


Hu was speaking to a group of Russian reporters ahead of a three-
trip to Russia that began Monday.


He told them that China still faced problems, such as excessively
high investment growth and excessive growth of credit.


In response, China has enhanced macro-economic adjustment and
controls, and taken measures to curb land supply, restrain bank
lending and boost consumption so as to prevent the economy from
potential overheating, Hu said.


He said China would seek to improve the "quality and efficiency"
of economic growth in the coming years.


When Chinese policy makers talk about better-quality growth, they
usually refer to development that has less of an impact on the
envoriment and does not exacerbate income inequality.


China is officially aiming for economic growth of around eight
percent in 2007 although analysts widely expect the figure to
come in again at closer to 10 percent.
