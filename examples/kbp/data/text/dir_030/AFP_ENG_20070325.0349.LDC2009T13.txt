The giant Airbus A380 superjumbo left Frankfurt for Washington on
Sunday, only three hours after arriving from Hong Kong, on
another journey designed to test that it is up to long-haul
routes.


The plane touched down at Germany's main aiport at 3:28 pm (1328
GMT) with 439 passengers, 32 staff and five pilots from
Lufthansa, a spokesman said. The German airline has ordered 15 of
the planes.


At 6:35 pm (1635 GMT), the world's largest aircraft took off
again with 467 passengers, a crew of 23 and two pilots.


Friday's outgoing flight from Frankfurt was delayed for three
hours because of a hydraulics problem. A replacement part had to
be delivered from Airbus's Toulouse site, in southwest France.


Two of the double-decker craft landed on US soil for the first
time on Monday, greeted by large crowds as they touched down in
Los Angeles and New York.


The A380 made its maiden flight to Asia last year, visiting seven
cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. The first A380 for
commercial use is scheduled to be delivered to Singapore Airlines
in October.


The test flights will take the plane to Munich in southern
Germany on Wednesday, before it returns to base in Toulouse.
