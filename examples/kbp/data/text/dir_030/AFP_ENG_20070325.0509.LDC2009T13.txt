Chinese President Hu Jintao left Beijing on Monday for a three-
day trip to Russia which is expected to see the two nations sign
up to four billion dollars in trade deals, state media said.


Hu said ahead of his visit, his third to Russia since becoming
president, that it would further consolidate warming relations
between the two world powers.


"I believe that, under joint efforts of both sides, the visit
will achieve substantial fruits, and inject new impetus into the
growth of China-Russian ties," the state-run Xinhua news agency
quoted Hu as saying.


Trade reached a record 33.4 billion dollars in 2006, up nearly 15
percent from 2005, according to Chinese figures.


Deals worth up to four billion dollars are expected to be signed
during Hu's visit, with energy expected to be a key focus, the
China Daily said on Monday.
