Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah on Sunday approved a
new 16-member cabinet with two women ministers for the first
time, with the main posts remaining unchanged, official media
said.


The cabinet did not include outgoing health minister Sheikh Ahmad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah, a senior ruling family member, who faced a
vote of no-confidence by the opposition-dominated parliament.


The former cabinet resigned on March 4 in an attempt to avoid the
minister from being voted out of office.


Besides Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Mohammad al-Ahmad al-Sabah,
a newphew of the emir, the main posts remained held by members of
the ruling Al-Sabah family.


Sheikh Jaber Mubarak al-Sabah was retained as first deputy
premier and minister of defence and interior, while Sheikh
Mohammad al-Sabah stayed as deputy premier and foreign minister.


The energy portfolio was split to the ministry of oil and
ministry of electricity and water, as was the case several years
ago. Sheikh Ali Jarrah al- Sabah, who was energy minister, was
retained in the oil portfolio.


Finance Minister Bader Minshari al-Humaidhi also kept his post.


The cabinet included six new faces while five former ministers
were dropped, including state minister for cabinet affairs,
Ismail al-Shatti.


The two women in the cabinet are Maasouma al-Mubarak who was
moved from communications to the health ministry, and Nuriya al-
Sebih who was given the education portfolio.
