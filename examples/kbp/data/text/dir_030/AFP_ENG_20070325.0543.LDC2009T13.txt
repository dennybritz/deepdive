Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was in the lead with 53.5 percent of
the vote in a runoff of the presidential election with 82 percent
of the ballots counted, an interior ministry source said Monday.


Ould Abdallahi, supported by a coalition of parties once loyal to
ousted long- time dictator Maaouiya Ould Taya, was leading in 11
of 13 regions in the country's first democratic presidential
election since independence from France in 1960.


His opponent, longtime opposition politician Ahmed Ould Daddah,
had won more than 60 percent of Sunday's vote in the capital
Nouakchott and his native Trarza region in the southeast, the
source said.


Complete preliminary results were expected later Monday.


After a constitutional referendum in June, local and
parliamentary polls in November and senatorial elections in
January, the presidential polls mark the final stage of
democratic reforms led by the military junta that ousted Ould
Taya in August 2005.
