Indy-car racer Pablo Perez, a rookie from Argentina hurt in a
crash Saturday during a developmental series race, was listed in
stable condition here Sunday after surgery for severe leg
injuries.


Michael Olinger, Indy Racing League director of medical services,
said in a statement that Perez was progressing as expected
following the operation Saturday night at Jackson Memorial
Hospital.


Perez was injured in a multi-car accident on lap 47 of the Miami
100 race at the Homestead Miami oval, the opening race of the
Indy-car developmental series season.


The statement did not indicate whether amputation was needed.
