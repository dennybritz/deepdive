The Czech Republic should demand that a US anti-missile radar
proposed for installation in the country is eventually made part
of NATO's common defence, Deputy Prime Minister Martin Bursik
said Sunday.


"We're going to see where we can take the debate, but it seems
logical that the response should at least include fundamental
conditions that we want to negotiate," he said during a debate on
CT public television.


Bursik's Green party is part of the governing center-right
coalition. Green officials say they will not support the
installation of the radar if it does not include the NATO
requirement.


Washington officially requested in January that the Czech
Republic and Poland -- both fellow NATO members -- host parts of
the anti-missile defence system in a scheme that has angered
Moscow.


Parts of the shield, designed to detect and intercept missiles
from North Korea and Iran, are already in place in the United
States, Britain and Greenland, and the plan is to have the system
operational by 2011-2012.
