Slovakia's prime minister pledged Sunday to keep alive the memory
of the victims of the Holocaust, in a speech at a ceremony to
mark the first deportation of Jews to the concentration camps.


Robert Fico was speaking at the Poprad station, in the north of
the country, where the first train carrying Slovakian Jews left
for Nazi concentration camps 65 years ago.


"I want to confirm once again that the Slovakian government and I
personally, we always will do everything so that we do not
forget," said Fico.


"I have the impression that the Slovakian public knows less and
less of what happened in the concentration camps," he added.


The first train carried a thousand Jewish women and girls to
Auschwitz, leaving on March 25, 1942.


The Museum of the National Slovakian Uprising, based in the
central town of Banska Bystrica, had prepared a exhibition on the
deportations carried out by the fascist regime that ruled the
country between 1939 and 1944.


The exhibition, set up in cattle wagons, was officially opened
Sunday at Poprad. From October, the wagons will leave Poprad and
travel to 30 towns across the country, said the museum's director
Sranislav Micev.


Most of the 70,000 Jews deported to the Nazi camps of Auschwitz,
Majdanek and Sobibor in occupied Poland, perished there.
