US chip giant Intel will announce Monday plans to build a 2.5
-billion-dollar semiconductor plant in China, state media said.


Intel CEO Paul Otellini is expected to attend the signing
ceremony for the project at the Great Hall of the People,
Beijing's parliament building, later in the day, the official
Xinhua news agency reported.


Xinhua quoted the government of Dalian, the northeastern port
city where the huge plant is expected to be located, for the
information.


Since Intel issued invitations for Monday's event last week,
speculation has been heating up that it would be about the Dalian
plant.


The National Development and Reform Commission said earlier this
month that it had given approval for the Intel plan.


The 12-inch (300-millimetre) integrated wafer plant would have a
monthly capacity of 52,000 chips, the commission said in a brief
release.


Intel, which has invested about one billion dollars in China so
far, already has major assembly and test operations in Shanghai
and Chengdu, in the country's southwest.


At 90 nanometers, the chips made in Dalian would be some of the
most advanced semiconductors manufactured in China.
