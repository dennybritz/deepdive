Stressed British judges will be able to make use of a 24-hour
helpline that will offer them "practical and emotional support"
from next month, The Times reported in an early edition of its
Monday paper.


Citing the most senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Chief
Justice Lord Nicholas Phillips, the paper said that the helpline
will be available to all 1,400 full-time judges on all levels of
the judiciary.


"Judging is necessarily a solitary task, and can be lonely,"
said, Phillips, who is concerned that the increased workload for
judges, as well as a greater degree of media scrutiny, will
hamper recruitment.


Those judges who use the helpline will be able to receive advice
on matters as varied as retirement and relationship problems,
with an initial telephone call followed by more counselling, and
possibly referral to a specialist.


It will be confidential, except in cases where counsellors would
be legally forced to disclose matters revealed.
