President Roh Moo-Hyun has congratulated prodigy Park Tae-hwan on
handing South Korea its first-ever world swimming title, the
presidential office said Monday.


Roh, on a visit to the Middle East, sent a congratulatory message
to the teenager who stunned defending champion Grant Hackett to
claim the men's 400m freestyle gold medal in Melbourne on Sunday.


"President Roh congratulated Park on winning the gold medal with
an outstanding performance ... and asked him to continue efforts
to keep boosting South Korea's profile," his office said in a
statement.


Major newspapers carried front-page stories and photos of the 17
-year-old raising his arms in joy after the biggest victory of
his short career.


The Seoul schoolboy clinched gold in 3:44.30, with Tunisia's
Oussama Mellouli second (3:45.12) and Hackett third (3:45.43).


The upset handed South Korea its first ever world swimming title
and gave Park a massive boost ahead of the Beijing Olympics next
year.


Park burst onto the scene at the Asian Games in December where he
won the 200m, 400m and 1500m freestyle golds.


He will swim all three races in Melbourne and got his 200m
campaign underway Monday, finishing third in the heats behind
Olympic champion Pieter Van Den Hoogenband and Amercian superstar
Michael Phelps.
