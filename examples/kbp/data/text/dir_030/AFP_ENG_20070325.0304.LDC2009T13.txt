UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Sunday urged Iran to return to talks,
after the UN Security Council imposed fresh sanctions on the
Islamic republic over its controversial nuclear program.


The secretary general called on Iran "to urgently take the
necessary steps to restore the international community's trust
that its nuclear program is peaceful in nature," a statement from
his office said.


Ban applauded Saturday's unanimous vote on Resolution 1747 and
said he "believes that a negotiated solution would strengthen the
international non-proliferation regime and hopes that dialogue
will resume."


The resolution restricts financial aid or loans to Tehran, blocks
all Iranian arms exports and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for
Iran to comply with UN demands or face "further appropriate
measures."


The new sanctions come after Iran ignored repeated ultimatums to
suspend uranium enrichment, the process that produces fuel for
nuclear power stations, but which in highly extended form can
also make the fissile core for an atomic bomb.


Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes,
has blasted the sanctions as "unlawful" and "unjustifiable." Its
foreign minister on Sunday ignored EU and Russian appeals to
return to talks.


The major powers have said Iran must first suspend enrichment
before substantive talks can take place. Iran insists any
suspension should be a matter for the negotiations themselves.
