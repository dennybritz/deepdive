English Premiership giants Arsenal's season has been a failure
their stylish young Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas claimed on
Sunday.


The 19-year-old told the News of the World that finishing the
season without a trophy was sad and the past few weeks had been
really hard after seeing themselves knocked out of the Champions
League, FA Cup and losing in the League Cup final to Chelsea.


They also trail Premiership leaders Manchester United by 20
points.


"This season there will be nothing and that's hard," said
Fabregas, who is one of the youngsters heralded by manager Arsene
Wenger as guaranteeing the club a bright future.


"To be so many points behind United is not good enough."


"It was so disappointing to go out of the Champions League to PSV
Eindhoven.


"We had the chances to beat them. After reaching the final last
year I thought we could go all the way again and win it this
time.


"It's hard to imagine that a few weeks ago we were still in all
the competitions - the Champions League, FA Cup and through to
the League Cup final.


"But now we are out of everything," added Fabregas, who has
failed to score in his 29 Premiership appearances this season.
