Tamil Tiger rebels said they used two aircraft to bomb Sri
Lanka's main military airbase and both planes returned to rebel-
held territory safely after the attack.


The political wing leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), S. P. Thamilselvan, told a Colombo-based Tamil newspaper
in a telephone interview that they carried out the bombing.


"The LTTE awaited the safe return of the two aircraft before
claiming the attack," a reporter on the newspaper quoted
Thamilselvan as saying.
