A 5.3-magnitude aftershock hit the western coast of Japan's main
island early Monday, the meteorological agency said, a day after
a powerful earthquake killed one person and injured more than 170
in the same region.


No tsunami alert was issued for the latest quake, which hit the
Noto peninsula, about 300 kilometres (186 miles) northwest of the
capital, Tokyo, at 7:16 am (2216 GMT), the agency said.


The quake, which struck in the Sea of Japan (East Sea), was the
equal-largest aftershock since a 6.9-magnitude earthquake rocked
the same region Sunday morning.


The meteorological agency said as many as 174 tremors strong
enough to be felt by residents had been detected in the area of
Sunday's quake.
