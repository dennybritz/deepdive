Debutants Bermuda were struggling at 17-3 in 7.4 overs against
Bangladesh when rain stopped play in their last World Cup group
match at the Queen's Park Oval here on Sunday.


Opener Oliver Pitcher was batting on eight and skipper Irvine
Romaine on one after the match was reduced to 35-overs-a-side due
to rain.


Opener Stephen Outerbridge, Delyone Borden and David Hemp were
the batsmen dismissed after Bermuda had been put in to bat.


Fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza took two wickets and Syed Rasel one.


Bangladesh, who have beaten India in their first match in the
four-team group, need to win this game to qualify for the second
round.


Bermuda have lost both of their games against India and Sri
Lanka.


Sri Lanka were the first team to qualify for the Super Eights
with an all-win record.


India have finished their group campaign with one win and two
defeats. Their lone win came against Bermuda, the weakest side in
the group.


The top two sides will make it to the next round.


India can still qualify for the second round if Bermuda beat
Bangladesh.


Bangladesh retained the side that lost to Sri Lanka by 198 runs
in the previous match.
