Rain stopped play in the World Cup match between Bangladesh and
debutants Bermuda at the Queen's Park Oval here on Sunday.


Bermuda were 6-1 in three overs after being put in to bat in
overcast conditions, with opener Oliver Pitcher batting on three
and Delyone Borden on one.


Opener Stephen Outerbridge was the lone batsman dismissed, caught
by Mohammad Rafique at fine-leg off fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza
for no score.


Bangladesh, who have beaten India in their first match in the
four-team group, need to win this game to qualify for the second
round.


Bermuda have lost both of their games against India and Sri
Lanka.


Sri Lanka were the first team to qualify for the Super Eights
with an all-win record.


India have finished their group campaign with one win and two
defeats. Their lone win came against Bermuda, the weakest side in
the group.


The top two sides will make it to the next round.


India can still qualify for the second round if Bermuda beat
Bangladesh.


Bangladesh retained the side that lost to Sri Lanka by 198 runs
in the previous match.
