A court in Algeria sentenced five kidnappers to death in absentia
on Sunday, the Algerian news agency APS reported.


The court in the northern Kabylie region found the gang guilty of
kidnapping Mahdi B., the son of a wealthy fish trader from Dellys
in the Boumerdes region, 50 kilometres (30 miles) east of
Algiers.


The court heard how Mahdi B. had been on his way to the
neighbouring town of Tizi Ouzou to buy fish when he fell into a
trap laid by an armed Islamist group as he was leaving Dellys.


The hostage was freed the next day after his father paid a ransom
of 5.5 million dinars (55,000 euros, 73,000 dollars).
