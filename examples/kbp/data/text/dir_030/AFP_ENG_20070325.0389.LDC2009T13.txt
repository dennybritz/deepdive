A Georgian interior ministry official and his driver were killed
Sunday in an ambush near Tskhinvali, the capital of the breakaway
republic of South Ossetia, Georgia's government said.


Archil Tskhakaya and his chauffeur were between the Georgian-held
villages of Avneva and Nikozi when a dozen Ossetians ambushed
their car, an interior ministry spokesman said.


"The car was attacked by fire from grenade-launchers and high-
calibre weapons," said the spokesman, Shota Khinzanishvili.


Tskhakaya is the head of one of the departments at the Georgian
interior ministry.


South Ossetia is one of two Russian-backed separatist regions
inside Georgia where a fragile ceasefire has held since Georgian
authorities were driven out in the early 1990s. Joint Georgian-
Ossetian-Russian peacekeeping forces police the ceasefire.


Moscow backs the rebel authorities in South Ossetia, which has a
population of between 50,000 and 100,000, while not explicitly
endorsing full-blown independence.
