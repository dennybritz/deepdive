British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett on Sunday made it
"extremely clear" to her Iranian counterpart that 15 British
naval personnel being held by Iran were operating in Iraqi
waters, a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.


In a telephone conversation with Manouchehr Mottaki, who was in
New York, Beckett "made extremely clear our view that our
personnel were operating in Iraqi waters, called for their
immediate return, and asked for immediate consular access to
them," the spokesman said.


Mottaki was at the United Nations, where the Security Council
unanimously imposed fresh sanctions on Iran Saturday over its
refusal to suspend uranium enrichment.


The foreign ministry spokesman said the telephone conversation
was restricted, however, to the issue of the military personnel.


Mottaki had earlier told a press conference that the detained
group stand accused of "illegal entry" into Iran's territorial
waters.


British authorities said they did not know where the personnel,
who were seized on Friday, were being held, but Iran said the 14
men and one woman were all in good health.


The eight British Royal Navy sailors and seven Royal Marines, all
based on the British warship HMS Cornwall, were seized in the
Gulf waterway that divides Iraq and Iran.


Britain says the group was conducting "routine" anti-smuggling
operations, but Iran said Saturday the group had admitted to
illegally entering Iranian waters.
