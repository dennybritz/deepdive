The giant Airbus A380 superjumbo touched down in Frankfurt on
Sunday from Hong Kong, completing a journey designed to test that
it was up to long-haul routes.


The plane touched down at 3:28 pm (1328 GMT). The 439 passengers
included 32 staff and five pilots from Lufthansa, a spokesman
said. The German airline has ordered 15 of the planes.


The tests were not without problems. Friday's outgoing flight
from Frankfurt was delayed for three hours because of a
hydraulics problem. A replacement part had to be delivered from
Airbus's Toulouse site, in southwest France.


Two of the double-decker craft landed on US soil for the first
time on Monday, greeted by large crowds as they touched down in
Los Angeles and New York.


The A380 made its maiden flight to Asia last year, visiting seven
cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. The first A380 for
commercial use is scheduled to be delivered to Singapore Airlines
in October.


The next set of test flights will take the plane to New York and
then Munich in southern Germany, before it returns to base in
Toulouse.
