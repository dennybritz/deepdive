Hong Kong shares prices opened 0.14 percent higher Monday led by
banking giant HSBC and select other blue chips after Wall Street
posted significant gains last week, dealers said.


Sentiment was supported by better-than-expected existing home
sales data in the US, with investors now awaiting new home sales
figures for February due out later in the day.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index opened up 27.24 points at
19,719.88.
