New Zealand suffered a second successive injury blow on Sunday
when opening batsman Lou Vincent broke his wrist in the nets and
was ruled out of the World Cup, it was reported.


Vincent made 101 in the Group C win against Canada at St Lucia,
having collected two noughts in the matches with England and
Kenya.


He was struck by a ball from speedster Shane Bond during practice
on Sunday ahead of the Black Caps opening Super Eights match
against the West Indies here on Thursday, the BBC reported.


The injury came on the same day that Chris Martin was given
permission to joind the squad in place of fellow seamer Daryl
Tuffey who has also been ruled out through injury.
