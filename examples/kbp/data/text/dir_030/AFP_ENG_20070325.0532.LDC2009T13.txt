Australia want to use Mark Viduka on a selective basis to
encourage him to stay in international football until the 2010
World Cup in South Africa.


The 31-year-old Middlesbrough striker was influential in
Australia's 2-0 win over China in Guangzhou on Saturday, again
emphasising how crucial he is to the team.


Interim national coach Graham Arnold is trying to convince Viduka
to keep playing for his country beyond the Asian Cup finals in
July.


To encourage him, Arnold wants to use the striker on a selective
basis and not overburden him with too many international call-
ups, which involve long flights away from his English home and
children.


"He showed why we need him to stay on. We can't afford to lose
him just yet," Arnold told The Australian newspaper.


"I know Mark has certain ideas in his head at the moment and I
can understand his thinking.


"Call it molly-coddlying if you like but we can look after him
with a well- thought out schedule in which he won't have to play
in too many meaningless games and where we can cut down on his
travelling."


Viduka told the Melbourne Age he is receptive to Arnold's
suggestion.


"I haven't made a decision whether I will quit, whether I will or
won't," Viduka said.


"There is obviously pressure on me to go on. I enjoy playing with
the national team, but it's just a situation we have to weigh up.
Maybe we can make some sort of a compromise."
