The Seattle SuperSonics will reportedly be without Ray Allen as
they wrap up their disappointing National Basketball Association
season.


The Seattle Times reported Sunday on its website that Allen will
miss the remainder of the campaign with bone spurs in his left
ankle.


The NBA's eighth-leading scorer at 26.4 points per game, Allen
was examined by doctor Richard Ferkel in Los Angeles on Friday
and missed Seattle's game against Minnesota that night.


Two days later, SuperSonics general manager Rick Sund told the
newspaper that Allen would undergo season-ending surgery. The
report did not include a scheduled date for the operation.


"It makes sense for Ray to go forward and have the surgery," Sund
said.  "He's been playing with pain for some time now, and all
parties involved agree that this is what is best for Ray in the
long run."


The SuperSonics have the second-worst record in the Western
Conference at 27-41 and are six games behind the Los Angeles
Clippers for the eighth and final playoff spot.
