Thomas Grandi, a four-time Canadian Olympian who won back-to-back
Alpine World Cup giant slalom ski races in 2004, retired from the
sport here Sunday after 14 seasons.


Grandi, an 11-time Canadian champion, won consecutive races three
seasons ago in Alta Badia, Italy, and Flachau, Autria, and
departs with nine career World Cup podium finishes.


Grandi and his wife, Olympic cross-country skier Sara Renner,
welcomed their first child, daughter Aria, last month.


"I'm handing my skis in for a new life," said Grandi. "Getting up
in the morning to change diapers is going to be my biggest
challenge for the next little while."


Grandi said he knew it was time to retire when he felt his
competitive desire wane.


"One thing that you really need is that fire in your belly when
you are ski racing because you have to be willing to take
chances, to take risks. You need that to be competative and to be
the best," Grandi said.


"I just didn't have that fire this year and to me that was a
clear sign it was time to move on."
