Japanese share prices drifted lower in subdued morning trade
Monday as investors turned cautious ahead of an upcoming slew of
US and domestic economic data, dealers said.


They said shares gave up early gains as investors opted to pocket
profits after a four-day winning streak last week.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index of leading
shares was down 10.48 points or 0.06 percent at 17,470.13 by the
lunch break.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section lost 6.36 points or 0.37 percent to 1,735.58.
