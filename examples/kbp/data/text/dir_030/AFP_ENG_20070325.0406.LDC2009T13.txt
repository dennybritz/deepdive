Polling stations closed in the second round of Mauritania's
presidential elections at 7:00 pm (GMT) Sunday, with no reports
of any major incidents, the interior ministry said.


"There have been no incidents. Everything went off calmly and
peacefully," said a source at the ministry.


At 6:00 pm, voter turnout was 58.59 percent and more than 60
percent in the capital, said the source.


That compared with 65 percent nationally at the same time during
the first round. Journalists and other observers had already
noted what appeared to be a lower turnout for the second round.


At 7:00 pm in the busy Arafat sector, polling stations no longer
had queues when the time came to close up.


Marie-Anne Isler-Beguin, head of the European team of 85 election
observers, said she was satisfied.


"Inside the voting stations and in the queues, there is nothing
to report," she said.


While there had been plenty of party political activity near the
polling stations, once inside the voting stations people were
free to make their choice in peace, she added.


Sunday's voting, which started at 7:00 am is the final state in a
gradual return to civilian rule after the 2005 military coup and
the country's first democratic presidential election since
independence from France in 1960.


The first results were due to released later on Sunday and a
final outcome on Monday.
