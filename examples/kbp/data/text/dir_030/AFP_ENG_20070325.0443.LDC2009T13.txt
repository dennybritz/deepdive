Tamil Tiger guerrillas used a light aircraft Monday to bomb Sri
Lanka's main military airbase located next to the island's only
international airport, the airforce said.


"One of the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) aircraft had
flown over the airbase and dropped some explosive items,"
airforce spokesman Ajantha Silva said, adding that damage to the
military facility was "minor."


He said the Bandaranaike international airport, which shares a
boundary with the airbase, was not affected by the pre-dawn
attack. However, the international airport was shut as a
precautionary measure.
