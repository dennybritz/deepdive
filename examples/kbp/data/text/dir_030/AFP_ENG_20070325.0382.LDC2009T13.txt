Scotland captain Scott Murray has  signed a two-year contract
with top flight rugby union side Montauban, the French club
confirmed Sunday.


The 31-year-old lock currently plays with Edinburgh.


With 84 appearances for Scotland, Murray became the most capped
player in Scottish rugby history during the Six Nations
tournament earlier this month.


He has been virtually ever-present in the Scots XV since making
his debut in 1997 and is regarded as one of the best line-out
jumpers in world rugby and the only player to have been named
Scotland's player of the year three times.


Scotland finished bottom of the Six Nations table this season.
