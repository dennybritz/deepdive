Listening at least 400 times to different heart sounds on an iPod
is an effective way to improve a doctor's ability to detect a
problem, a study published Sunday showed.


For 90 minutes, 149 medical students listened 400 times to the
five most frequent heart murmurs. The singe practice session
improved the rate of detection by stethoscope to 80 percent from
40 percent among generalists.


The study by Temple University cardiologist Michael Barrett, was
presented at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology, a
gathering of some 30,000 specialists.


The ability to detect heart anomalies is essential to finding a
range of cardiac problems and can reduce the number of
unnecessary tests like echocardiograms and stress tests, Barrett
said.
