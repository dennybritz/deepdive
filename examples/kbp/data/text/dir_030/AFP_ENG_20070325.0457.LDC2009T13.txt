Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Sunday called on nations
around the world to help stop what he says is a planned US attack
on Iran.


Chavez, speaking one day after the UN Security Council voted to
tighten sanctions on Iran over Tehran's refusal to curtail its
nuclear program, cited a Russian press report which purportedly
details the time and place of a attack on Iran by the United
States, which he has dubbed "the empire."


"The empire is moving aircraft carriers and has been moving
troops on Iran," said Chavez, speaking on his broadcast program
"Hello, Mr. President."


Hopefully the world "will halt this imperial craziness of
attacking whomever it pleases. Hopefully the Congress of the
United States, the United Nations and the most powerful countries
of the world can halt this madness of the American empire," said
Chavez.


Today it may be Iran, Chavez said, "but tomorrow it could be
Belarus, Venezuela, or anyone they dislike."


Chavez is a close ally of Cuba's Fidel Castro and a vehement
critic of US President George W. Bush. He hosted Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Caracas in January.
