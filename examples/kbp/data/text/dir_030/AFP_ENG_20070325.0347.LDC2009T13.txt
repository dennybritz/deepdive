Spain's opposition Popular Party could fall foul of a new
electoral law -- a law it actually opposes -- after presenting an
all-woman list of candidates for local elections, a newspaper
reported Sunday.


The party put forward the list in the town of Garachico on the
island of Tenerife for elections due on May 17, the centre-right
El Mundo reported.


The all-women list came about by default, because no men were
willing to stand for the party in the town, which is a socialist
stronghold.


But it may violate a law passed by the ruling Socialists just
last week forbidding a candidates list that has more than 60
percent of either sex.


The law was designed to increase the representation of women in
politics, but the Popular Party opposed it on the grounds that it
violated their constitutional right to choose their candidate
lists freely.


The nominated women meanwhile have insisted they are no
pushovers.


"We will continue and see who dares reject our list," one
candidate told El Mundo.
