Detroit's Rasheed Wallace received his second one-game suspension
of the National Basketball Association season here on Sunday
after picking up his 18th technical foul of the season.


It was Wallace's record-setting accumulation of technical fouls
that prompted the NBA to institute a rule this season issuing
one-game suspensions for a 16th technical foul in a season and
every other one thereafter.


Wallace sat out two weeks ago when the Pistons visited the Los
Angeles Clippers after receiving his 16th technical foul.


His 18th technical foul was issued 30 seconds into the second
quarter of Friday's 90-89 loss at San Antonio and as a result
Wallace was banished for Detroit's game Sunday at Milwaukee.


Wallace is averaging 12.6 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.9 assists a
game for the Pistons, who lead the Eastern Conference with a
42-25 record while the Milwaukee Bucks are 25-42 with the second-
fewest triumphs in the East.
