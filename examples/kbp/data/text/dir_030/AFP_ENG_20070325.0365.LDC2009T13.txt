Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah on Sunday approved a
new 16-member cabinet with two women ministers for the first
time, with the main posts remaining unchanged, official media
said.


The cabinet did not include outgoing health minister Sheikh Ahmad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah, a senior ruling family member, who faced a
vote of no-confidence by the opposition-dominated parliament.


The former cabinet resigned on March 4 in an attempt to avoid the
minister from being voted out of office.
