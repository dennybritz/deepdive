Sri Lanka's national carrier on Monday urged travellers to check
on rescheduled flights before heading to the island's only
international airport after a rebel air raid forced it to shut
down briefly.


Sri Lankan Airlines said that many incoming and outbound flights
had been rescheduled following the Tamil Tiger raid on a military
airbase adjacent to the civilian facility, which left three
airmen dead and 16 others wounded.


"The Colombo BIA Airport re-opened to all traffic at 3:30 am
(2200 GMT). All Sri Lankan Airlines aircraft and passengers and
staff remain unharmed," the flag carrier said in a statement.


Officials said at least four inbound flights were diverted to
neighbouring India's southern city of Chennai.


Sri Lanka's foreign ministry spokesman Ravinatha Aryasinha said
operations at the airport were not affected by the Tiger raid.


"There is no damage to the international airport or the runway,"
Aryasinha said. "Flights were suspended only as a precautionary
measure."
