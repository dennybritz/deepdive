US chip giant Intel said Monday that it plans to build a 2.5
-billion-dollar semiconductor plant in China.


The 12-inch (300-millimetre) integrated wafer plant will be
located in the northeast Chinese port city of Dalian, Intel said
in a statement issued ahead of a ceremony in Beijing.


The Chinese government announced this month it had given the
green light for the project, saying it would have a monthly
capacity of 52,000 chips.
