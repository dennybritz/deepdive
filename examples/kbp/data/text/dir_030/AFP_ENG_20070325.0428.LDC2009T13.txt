Sri Lanka's only international airport was shut early Monday
following a suspected Tamil Tiger attack on an adjoining military
airbase, officials said.


Passengers who had boarded aircraft were asked to disembark and
taken to a shelter, officials said, adding that the move followed
gunfire and explosions heard at the adjoining military base.


There were no reports of casualties at the international airport,
but 10 airforce personnel from the military base were rushed to
the nearby Negombo hospital, officials said.


Bandaranaike international airport is about 35 kilometres (21
miles) north of here.
