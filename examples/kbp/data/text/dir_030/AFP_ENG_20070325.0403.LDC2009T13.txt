Super League leaders Bradford suffered a surprise defeat at the
hands of the Catalans Dragons on Sunday.


Jason Croker's drop goal and a last-minute try from John Wilson
saw the Dragons snatch a first away win of the season.


Croker's effort gave the Dragons a 13-point lead midway through
the second half at the Grattan Stadium and it proved crucial.


Michael Platt and James Evans crossed to set up a frantic finish
but Wilson touched down in the last act of the game to confirm
the Dragons' win.


It was only the third time the Dragons, for whom Thomas Bosc also
scored 14 points, had recorded a win away since joining Super
League last year.


Wakefield, meanwhile, climbed joint top with a 30-24 win against
Warrington.


The Wildcats led 10-0 through tries from Peter Fox and Ryan
Atkins and were four points clear at the break.


Warrington began the second half strongly with tries from Chris
Bridge and Jon Clarke, with Bridge converting both efforts.


But Wakefield hit back with tries from Waine Pryce, Ben Jeffries
and Tevita Leo- Latu and they held on for victory.


They are now equal on ten points with leaders Bradford with Leeds
also on ten points after their 28-16 win against Harlequins on
Friday.


Elsewhere winless Huddersfield's misery continued as they
suffered an agonising 18-16 loss to Salford at the Galpharm
Stadium, their seventh successive defeat.


Teenager Jordan Turner's first try sealed a crucial win for the
Reds, who have now moved five points clear of the Giants at the
bottom of the table.
