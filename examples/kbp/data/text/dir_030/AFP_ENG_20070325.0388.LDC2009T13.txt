Former German transport minister Matthias Wissmann will on Monday
be named head of the country's powerful VDA auto industry
association, daily Berliner Zeitung reported.


Wissman, a minister under former chancellor Helmut Kohl, will
replace Bernd Gottschalk who resigned on March 10 amid attacks
from carmakers that he was not doing enough to promote the
industry's achievements in cutting harmful emissions.


The VDA represents 500 manufacturers such a Volkswagen,
DaimlerChrysler and BMW who employ around 750,000 people.


A VDA spokesman declined to comment but Environment Minister
Sigmar Gabriel on Sunday congratulated Wissman on the
appointment, saying the 57-year-old would be bringing "his great
experience in transport policies and ... European affairs."
