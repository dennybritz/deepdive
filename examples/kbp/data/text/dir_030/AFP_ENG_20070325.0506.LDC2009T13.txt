New Zealand's largest listed company Telecom Corp said Monday it
would sell its Yellow Pages directories business for 2.24 billion
dollars (1.6 billion US) to a private equity consortium.


The business was bought by buyout firm CCMP Capital and Teachers'
Private Capital, the private investment arm of the Ontario
Teachers' Pension Plan.


The sale had been foreshadowed by the company with bids closing
last week.


Yellow Pages publishes telephone directories and their online
equivalents in New Zealand, with annual revenues of around 250
million dollars and 600 employees.


There has been speculation that Telecom, New Zealand's dominant
telecommunications provider, will return at least some of the
sale proceeds to shareholders.


The company said it would make no announcement on what it would
do with the proceeds until its quarterly results announcement in
early May.


Some analysts have said the company should have kept the
profitable business but Telecom chaiman Wayne Boyd described the
sale as "a significant outcome for Telecom shareholders.


"The board is satisfied that the transaction fairly reflects the
underlying value of the business," Boyd said.


Telecom shares were one cent higher at 4.78 dollars in early
afternoon trade on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.
