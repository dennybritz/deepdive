South Korea's top retailer Shinsegae Group said Thursday that the
owner's two children have paid taxes of 350 billion won (372
million dollars) on shares received from their father.


The sum is the largest ever paid by family owners of the nation's
conglomerates, known as chaebol, Yonhap news agency said.


Last September Chung Jae-Eun, the group's honorary chairman, gave
all of his 1.47 million shares in Shinsegae Co, or 7.82 percent,
to his son and daughter.


Chung is the husband of Lee Myung-Hee, the group's chairwoman and
the younger sister of Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-Hee.


Shinsegae said the two children -- vice chairman Chung Yong-Jin
and his younger sister Chung Yu-Kyung -- paid the taxes with
662,956 shares in Shinsegae Co, the group's flagship.


The payment lowered the Chung family's combined stake in the
retail giant to 25.2 percent from 28.7 percent.


The group said there has been no decision on when the group's
chairwoman will transfer her 15.33 percent stake in Shinsegae Co.
to her children.
