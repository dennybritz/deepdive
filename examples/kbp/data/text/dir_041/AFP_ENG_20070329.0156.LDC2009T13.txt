Track sprint queen Victoria Pendleton and teammate Shanaze Reade
are on course to hand Britain their first gold medal of the world
track cycling championships on Thursday.


The English pair beat Russia in their heat to dominate qualifying
for the inaugural women's team sprint event in a time of
33.630sec.


Britain will now meet Dutch pair Yvonne Hijgenaar and Willy Kanis
in the final scheduled for 1800 GMT.


Australian pair Kristine Bayley and Anna Meares will meet France
in the bronze medal match.


The Australian pair had set the second fastest time of the day in
dominating their heat against Poland however the Netherlands
pushed them down to third in their heat against Germany.


The first day of the four-day competition features four gold
medal events: the inaugural men's omnium, the inaugural women's
team sprint, the men's team sprint and the men's individual
pursuit.


Britain are also medal contenders in the men's team sprint, which
differs from the women's event in that three riders race instead
of two.


In the men's individual pursuit Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins
of Britain will be gunning for gold.
