Deutsche Bahn, Europe's leading rail company, said Thursday that
it was ready for partial privatisation in 2008 after it booked
its highest-ever profits last year.


"We achieved all our business goals in 2006 on our way to
privatisation," Deutsche Bahn said in a statement.


"From our point of view, private investors will be able to buy
shares in Deutsche Bahn in 2008," chairman Hartmut Mehdorn told
the group's annual earnings news conference here.


Net profit nearly tripled last year rising to 1.7 billion euros
(2.3 billion dollars) from 600 million euros a year earlier.


Operating profit, as measured by earnings before interest and tax
(EBIT), rose by 1.1 billion euros to 2.5 billion euros on a
20-percent rise in sales to 30.1 billion euros.


The 2006 business year was therefore "the most successful in our
history," Mehdorn said. "We again attracted more traffic to rail,
significantly increased revenues and profit and expanded our
position as a leading international logistics service provider."


The government is currently drawing up a law to float part of
Deutsche Bahn's share capital on the stock exchange. The draft is
expected to be ready by May with the initial public offering
(IPO) expected to take place in 2009.


Berlin decided at the end of last year to privatise the company
without its rail networks, which would remain in state hands.


For the current year, Deutsche Bahn said it was anticipating "a
slight increase in revenues and operating profit before one-off
items in 2007.
