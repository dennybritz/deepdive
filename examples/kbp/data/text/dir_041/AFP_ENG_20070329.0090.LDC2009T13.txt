Southern African leaders on Thursday began an emergency summit to
discuss the deepening crisis in Zimbabwe.


The summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
was hosted by Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, who met with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe after his arrival Wednesday
night.


Kikwete said that the meeting would not put pressure on the
embattled Zimbabwean leader.


"Pressure? We are in a meeting not pressure," Kikwete told
reporters.
