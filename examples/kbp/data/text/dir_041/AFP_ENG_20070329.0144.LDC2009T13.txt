The Ministry of Land and Resources said Thursday that China
discovered new recoverable crude oil reserves of 195 million
tonnes in 2006, up 10.8 percent from a year earlier.


New proven reserves fell 1.6 percent to 949 million tonnes last
year, the ministry said in a statement on its website.


It also said 581.6 billion cubic metres (20 trillion cubic feet)
of proven natural gas reserves was added in 2006, down 6.2
percent from 2005.


The estimates are based on preliminary statistics from fields
controlled by PetroChina, Sinopec, China National Offshore Oil
Corp and other local oil and gas companies, it said.


The reserve-production ratio, which reflects the number of years
during which known reserves could sustain output during a given
year, came in at 11 in 2006, down from between 14 and 15 since
the 1990s, it added.


With existing oil fields drying up, China has been increasingly
keen to find energy and resources both at home and abroad to fuel
what has grown into the world's fourth largest economy.


According to recent figures, China last year relied on imports
for 47 percent of total oil consumed, with the cost up 22.8
percent to reach 81.9 billion dollars.


Imports this year are expected to account for just under half of
its needs, rising more than 10 percent to top 160 million tonnes.
