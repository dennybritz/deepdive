Thai authorities Thursday decided to close down a park in central
Bangkok to prevent anti-coup protesters from staging a rally
there at the weekend, officials said.


Bangkok police, regional military officials and the city
government agreed to shut down the Sanam Luang field starting
Thursday until April 5, officials said.


"We have agreed that no one will be allowed to use Sanam Luang as
a rally site, or to use loud speakers or to set up stages for
public speaking," Bangkok police chief Adisorn Nonsi said.


"Sanam Luang will be completely off limits at night time,"
although people could still use the park during the day, he
added.


Up to 2,000 protesters have staged rallies in Sanam Luang in
recent weeks, and organisers had planned to hold another
demonstration there on Friday.


Sanam Luang, a large oval-shaped field near the Grand Palace in
Bangkok's old quarter, was also the scene of mass protests last
year that eventually led to the military ouster of elected prime
minister Thaksin Shinawatra.


Adisorn vowed to take action against anyone who tried to protest
in the park, saying intelligence reports indicated that thousands
of anti-coup protesters planned to join the rally.


"As a precautionary measure, police have prepared to deploy a
large number of officers to deal with the situation," he said.
