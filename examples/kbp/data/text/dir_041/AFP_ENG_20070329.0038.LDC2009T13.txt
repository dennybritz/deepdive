contracted 0.4 percent year-on-year in February below market
expectations, official data showed Thursday.


The February figure was a sharp reverse from a 7.5 percent gain

Lunar New Year holiday cut the number of working days.


Month-on-month, production rose 0.5 percent in February compared
to a 1.3 percent gain in January.


Private consumption, as measured by wholesale and retail sales of
consumer goods jumped 12.4 percent year-on-year in February after
a 2.7 percent gain in January.


Inventory rose 8.7 percent last month after a 11 percent increase
in January. Factories operated at 82.2 percent of capacity
compared to 81.4 percent in January.


The telecom and automobile sectors contracted 18.4 percent and

semiconductors grew 6.7 percent.


Gross shipments growth slowed sharply to 1.5 percent from 7.0
percent in January amid concern about cooling demand in the
United States.
