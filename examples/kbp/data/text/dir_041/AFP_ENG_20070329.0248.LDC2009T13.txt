Avalanches in northern Afghanistan killed 12 people, the
government said Thursday, in the latest fatalaties from flooding
and avalanches as winter snows melt and spring brings heavy rain.


Snow came crashing down mountains in the rugged northern
Badakhshan province on Wednesday, leaving a dozen people dead and
an equal number wounded, the interior ministry said in a
statement.


Floods and avalanches have killed at least 30 people in
Afghanistan this spring, according to officials and reports.


Hundreds of houses have been damaged or destroyed and thousands
of families displaced, the United Nations said this week.


The western provinces of Ghor and Badghis and Uruzgan and Helmand
in the south have been particularly badly affected.
