A suicide bomber blew himself up close to an army camp in eastern
Pakistan on Thursday, killing a soldier and wounding seven
others, officials said.


The attacker struck next to a military vehicle in Kharian, 135
kilometers (about 85 miles) southeast of the capital Islamabad,
near an army drivers' training centre, security officials said.


"One person was killed and seven others were wounded. All were
army men," one official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
