Turkey said Thursday it would launch tenders in April for oil and
gas exploration off its Mediterranean coast, an apparent response
to a similar move by Cyprus.


"Next month, we will launch the farm-out process for licenses we
have for (areas off) Antalya, Mersin and the Gulf of
Iskenderun... We are now preparing the technical groundwork,"
Ahmet Faruk Oner, a senior official at the Turkish Petroleum
Corporation (TPAO) was quoted by Anatolia news agency as saying.


"It means we will start looking for partners for the licenses,"
he said. "We will begin the announcements next month."


Oner explained that the licenses covered areas in Turkey's
12-mile territorial waters and some areas "a little beyond."


Even though officials have denied any link, Turkey's move follows
a spat over oil and gas exploration in the Mediterranean with
Cyprus, whose internationally recognised government Ankara does
not recognise.


Cyprus signed an agreement with Lebanon in January for the
delineation of an undersea border to facilitate future oil and
gas exploration, following similar accords with Egypt last year.


Turkey strongly warned Egypt and Lebanon in February that the
deals infringed on the rights of the Turkish Cypriots and their
breakaway statelet in the north of the island.


Ankara also maintained that it had rights and interests in the
region and was determined to protect them.


Cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since 1974 when Turkey
occupied the Turkish Cypriot-populated north in response to an
Athens-engineered Greek Cypriot coup seeking to unite the island
with Greece.
