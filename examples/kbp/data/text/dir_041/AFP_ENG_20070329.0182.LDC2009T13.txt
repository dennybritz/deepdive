A group of Bosnian prisoners staged a mutiny to protest poor
conditions at a detention centre in the northeastern town of
Doboj, authorities said Thursday.


Gunshots and several injuries were reported at the start of the
protest, which began early Wednesday when some 20 inmates
disarmed prison guards and demanded talks with the government.


BN television broadcast footage of the prisoners standing on the
roof of the facility with clubs in their hands as special police
surrounded the building.


The stand-off lasted until around midnight (2200 GMT), after
Bosnian Serb Justice Minister Dzerard Selman negotiated a
peaceful end to the protest.


"Prisoners ended the mutiny late on Wednesday," said Selman,
adding that two of the inmates were lightly injured in jostling.


"The ministry will open an investigation to determine how and why
the mutiny occurred," said Selman.


According to national television, the prisoners had demanded
better conditions in the detention centre that holds 120 inmates.
