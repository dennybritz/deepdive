The European Union resumed Thursday membership talks with Turkey,
which have been stalled by Ankara's refusal to meet its trade
obligations to EU member state Cyprus, an EU source said.


At a technical level meeting in Brussels, chief Turkish
negotiator Ali Babacan and representatives for the 27 EU
countries began talks on "enterprise and industry policy".


It is only the second of 35 policy areas -- or chapters -- which
Turkey has begun negotiating since it was accepted as an official
candidate for membership to Europe's rich club in October 2005.


The meeting comes three months after the EU froze eight of the
policy areas, or chapters, to punish the government in Ankara for
failing to fully extend its customs agreement with the bloc to EU
member country Cyprus.


EU-Turkey talks have been at a standstill since the "science and
research" was opened last June.
