Thailand's army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said
Thursday that national elections would be held on either December
16 or 22.


"It will be either December 16 or 22, and the mechanism will be
ready, including the constitution," he said.


"The referendum on a new constitution will be held no later than
September," he added.
