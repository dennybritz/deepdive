Thailand's army-installed Premier Surayud Chulanont said
elections to restore democracy would be held in December, and
ruled out a state of emergency in Bangkok as he sought to cool
soaring tensions.


Surayud said in brief remarks on national television that a
referendum on a new constitution would be held by September,
followed by parliamentary elections on either December 16 or 22.


The announcement came after Surayud met with the Council for
National Security (CNS), as the ruling junta calls itself, amid
calls from the top general for a state of emergency in Bangkok to
crack down on swelling protests.


"Today I called a meeting of the CNS, the Constitutional Drafting
Council, and the Election Commission to prepare for the
elections," Surayud said.


"It will be either December 16 or 22, and the mechanism will be
ready, including the constitution," he said.


"The referendum on a new constitution will be held no later than
September," he added.


But Surayud rejected calls from the junta leader, General Sonthi
Boonyaratglin, to impose emergency rule in Bangkok to thwart
anti-coup protests.


"The current situation is not serious enough to require emergency
rule," he said.


"But the government is prepared in case the situation worsens,
and I am empowered" to declare a state of emergency, he added.


"The government will try to talk with every party to prevent the
situation from deteriorating to that point," he said.


"I don't want to see clashes among Thai people," Surayud added.
