Flaming debris which fell from the sky near a Chilean airliner
over the Pacific Ocean may have been a meteorite, New Zealand
authorities said Thursday.


Reports on Wednesday said the objects, believed to have been the
remains of a Russian satellite, were estimated to have passed as
close as eight kilometres (five miles) from a LAN Airlines Airbus
A340 aircraft.


But a spokesman for Airways New Zealand, which manages New
Zealand's air traffic, said Thursday it was unclear where the
debris had come from.


"Whether that debris was a meteorite or falling space debris is
yet to be determined," Mitchell told Radio New Zealand.


"It will require an in-depth investigation and liaison with
international authorities to get to the bottom of this," he said.


The Russian Federal Space Agency said in a statement the
satellite had passed through the earth's atmosphere as scheduled
on Wednesday morning, New Zealand time. This was more than 12
hours after the aircraft passed through the area.


The remains of the satellite which had not burned up while
passing through the earth's atmosphere were believed to have
fallen into the Pacific Ocean at 2330 GMT on March 27, or 11.30
am Wednesday New Zealand time, it said.


Airways New Zealand said on Wednesday the pilot had reported
flaming debris falling in front of and behind the aircraft as it
crossed the Pacific Ocean late Tuesday night.


It said the pilot had initially believed the debris must be from
the spacecraft.
