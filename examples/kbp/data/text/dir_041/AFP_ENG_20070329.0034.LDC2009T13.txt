Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said on Thursday that
Israel refused to accept the revived Arab peace initiative as it
currently stands and said negotiations were needed.


"There is only one way to overcome our differences, and that is
negotiation," Peres told Israeli public radio. "It's impossible
to say: you must take what we offer you as is."


The blueprint, which was endorsed at an Arab summit on Wednesday,
offers Israel full normalisation of relations if it withdraws
from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the creation of
a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian refugees.
