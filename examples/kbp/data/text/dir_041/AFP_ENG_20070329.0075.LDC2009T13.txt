Chinese share prices closed mixed Thursday with the Shanghai
market boosted by institutional buying of heavyweight banks while
Shenzhen fell on profit-taking, dealers said.


They said that buying in banks pushed up the key Shanghai index
to new high but Shenzhen's technology-heavy board was unable to
follow suit.


Turnover remained strong amid expectations that fresh funds, a
plan by regulators to soon launch index futures and a set of
strong corporate earnings will see share prices move even higher
still.


On Wednesday total volumes in Shanghai and Shenzhen were
particularly heavy at more than 28 billion dollars, a level that
makes mainland China the most active market in Asia, even ahead
of Tokyo on a daily comparison.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, added 24.52 points or 0.77 percent at 3,197.54, a new
closing record, on turnover of 140.36 billion yuan (18.11 billion
dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 26.25 points or 0.79 percent at
3,360.82 on turnover of 139.96 billion yuan but the Shenzhen
A-share Index lost 16.41 points or 1.88 percent at 856.32 on
turnover of 62.29 billion yuan.
