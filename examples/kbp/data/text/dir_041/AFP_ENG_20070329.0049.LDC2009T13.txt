Three Buddhists were shot dead Thursday by suspected Islamic
rebels while two people, including a ranger, were wounded in
separate bomb attacks in Thailand's restive south, police said.


A 39-year-old man and his 32-year-old wife were gunned down in an
ambush by militants while riding a motorcycle in Narathiwat, one
of three Muslim-majority southern provinces bordering Malaysia,
police said.


A 51-year-old man on a motorcycle was also shot dead in a drive-
by shooting in Narathiwat, police said, adding a Muslim villager
was wounded after a roadside bomb exploded in the province
Thursday.


In neighboring Yala province, an army ranger was wounded in
another roadside bomb blast, they said.


Thailand's coup leader, General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, said
Wednesday Islamic separatists had infiltrated villages across the
region, making it difficult for the government to identify the
militants.


Sonthi is the first Muslim to lead the army in this mainly
Buddhist country, and his takeover in a September coup had
sparked hopes that he would find a way to end the unrest.


But the violence has worsened since the putsch in Bangkok despite
a series of peace initiatives by the army-installed government,
leaving more than 2,000 people dead in the three-year insurgency.
