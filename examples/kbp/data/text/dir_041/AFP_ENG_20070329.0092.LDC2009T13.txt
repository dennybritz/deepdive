A liquefied petroleum gas tank exploded in a luxury hotel in
southern Turkey on Thursday, killing one employee and injuring 10
people, media reports said.


Five tourists -- three Germans and two Russians -- and hotel
workers were among the wounded in the hotel blast in Belek, near
the Mediterranean city of Antalya, the CNN-Turk news channel
said.


The Anatolia news agency said the hotel's 32-year-old chief
butcher was killed in the explosion that ripped through the hotel
kitchen and damaged the restaurant.


The local gendarmerie confirmed the explosion but refused to give
details.


CNN-Turk suggested that the LPG canister had leaked as it was
being refilled.


Belek is one of the most popular holiday destinations for foreign
and domestic tourists in southern Turkey.
