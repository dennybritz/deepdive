Japanese police on Thursday raided the offices of firms on
allegations they illegally imported stainless steel processed in
arch-rival North Korea, officials said.


Police searched the offices of a stainless-steel company and a
trading house on allegations they imported the stainless products
and disguised them as "made in China", a police spokesman said.


The accused firms were Fitting Hisayo, the stainless-steel firm
in central Ishikawa prefecture, and Koyo Shoji, a trading house
in western Kyoto prefecture, he said.


Japan, which has tense relations with North Korea, has imposed
sweeping sanctions on the communist state including a ban on all
imports since its tests of missiles and an atom bomb last year.
