Singapore has rescheduled a graphic anti-smoking television
message after public concerns that it was unsuitable for
children, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) said Thursday.


After feedback that young children had been alarmed by the
message, the HPB said it would only air the message after 8:00
pm, when youngsters were less likely to be watching television.


"HPB has reviewed and revised our advertising timing to minimise
alarm to young children," said Lam Pin Woon, chief executive
officer of HPB, the government agency in charge of the campaign.


She added the message would also not run during programmes
targeted at families.


The message, first aired last Tuesday, starts with a tight shot
of the mouth of a woman suffering from oral cancer. She has sores
on her lips and decaying teeth.


"Smoking causes oral cancer," she says. "Quitting is hard, but
not quitting is harder."


The message is part of the first phase of a three-month anti-
smoking media campaign in the city-state.


Singapore cigarette packages already carry graphic pictures of
people with cigarette-related diseases.
