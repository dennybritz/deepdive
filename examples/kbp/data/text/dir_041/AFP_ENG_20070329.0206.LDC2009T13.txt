The Iranian consulate in Iraq's southern city of Basra accused
British forces of storming and surrounding its office during a
shootout with gunmen on Thursday.


The British military flatly denied any such incident, maintaining
that its soldiers came under small arms fire during a routine
patrol in the vicinity of the Iranian consulate but did not leave
their vehicles.


The incident came amid a diplomatic standoff between Tehran and
London over Iran's seizure of 15 British sailors in Gulf waters
last Friday.


"British forces sealed off the Iranian consulate in Basra. They
went inside for 10 minutes and after that there was intense
gunfire on them," Iranian consul Mohammed Reva Nasir told AFP in
Basra.


"This is a provocative act against the Iranian consulate in
Basra. I believe it has something to do with the British
detainees in Iran," he said.


Asked whether British troops raided the consulate, spokesman
Major David Gell told AFP: "No. Absolutely not."


"There was a vehicle patrol going back into Basra Palace (a
British base in Basra). The rear vehicle received small arms
fire. We returned fire in self defence and the patrol continued
on," Gell said.


"I'm led to believe (the incident happened) in the same street"
as the Iranian consulate, he added.


"There is absolutely no link to the building. It's pure
coincidence that it took place in that area," Gell said.


"No troops were injured and none of them got out of the vehicle."
