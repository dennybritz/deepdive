China said Thursday its currency, the yuan, was already decided
by the market and criticised a US Senate bid to pressure it to
free up its exchange rate as unwarranted interference.


"China has adopted an exchange rate policy that is decided by the
market," foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a regular press
briefing.


"Both sides need to observe the principle of mutual respect...
rather than using pressure or threatening to use pressure," he
said.


US senators warned Wednesday that new legislation could be
introduced in a matter of weeks that would apply tough trade
measures against China for allegedly undervaluing the yuan.


They said the cheap yuan was hurting the US economy by fueling a
massive US trade deficit with China that reached 232 billion
dollars last year.


China in 2005 adopted what it calls a managed floating exchange
rate regime, which many experts say is still tightly controlled
by the authorities, though the yuan has appreciated slightly.


While stressing that China would continue to pursue exhange rate
reform, Qin said it was "unfair" to only blame China for the US
deficit.


"Should the yuan's value reflect the market or should China
listen to instructions of other countries? I don't know why a
country that has adopted a market economy and free trade should
be dictating the policies of other countries," he said.
