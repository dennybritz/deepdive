A man claiming to be a Taliban commander said Thursday he was
holding a medical team in southern Afghanistan and would release
them in exchange for militants in custody.


The Afghan doctor, three nurses and their driver were kidnapped
in the southern province of Kandahar on Tuesday.


"We have the five-member medical team, they are safe and sound,"
a man claiming to be a local-level Taliban commander named Tur
Jan told AFP by telephone from a secret location.


"We are making a list of our prisoners and will release them in
exchange for our men in the government prisons," he said.


An Italian journalist was freed by the Taliban on March 19 after
a militant commander said the government had released five high-
profile Taliban prisoners.


The government admitted it had freed some Taliban, but said it
was a one-off deal.


The Taliban are still holding an Afghan journalist who was
kidnapped with the Italian in Helmand province March 4. The
militants beheaded an Afghan driver, accusing him of being a spy.


The exchange has angered journalists and diplomats who said it
encouraged militants and criminals to carry out kidnappings to
win the release of prisoners.


Afghans have also accused the government of being more concerned
with the fate of a foreign national than an Afghan.
