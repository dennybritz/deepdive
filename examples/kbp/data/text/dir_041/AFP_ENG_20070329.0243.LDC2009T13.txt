A liquefied natural gas tank exploded in a luxury hotel in
southern Turkey on Thursday, killing one employee and injuring 11
people, two of them foreign tourists, officials said.


The authorities launched an investigation into the blast in the
kitchen of the hotel in Belek, in the Mediterranean province of
Antalya, Turkey's main tourism hub, the Antalya governor's office
said in a statement.


The injuries to the 11 people -- a Russian and a Norwegian
tourists and nine employees -- were caused by broken glass and
are not serious, it said.


The Anatolia news agency identified the dead person as the
hotel's 32-year-old chief butcher.


The explosion also damaged the hotel's restaurant, it said.


The CNN-Turk news channel suggested that the LNG canister had
leaked as it was being refilled and the hotel management blamed
the blast on the company supplying the gas.


Belek, home to some of Turkey's poshest hotels, is one of the
most popular holiday destinations for foreign and domestic
tourists in the country.
