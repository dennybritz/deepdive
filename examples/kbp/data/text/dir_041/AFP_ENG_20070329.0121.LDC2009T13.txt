China on Thursday denied involvement with an engineer on trial in
the United States on charges of attempting to steal US military
secrets and called allegations of Chinese espionage "groundless".


"We have reiterated many times that the so-called stealing of US
military secrets is groundless and the accusations are due to
ulterior motives," foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a
regular press briefing, without elaborating.


Prosecutors in the trial of Chi Mak, a US citizen born in
southern China, said Wednesday he attempted to smuggle out
information on a secret technology to make US submarines silent.


China wanted the data to help in its drive to retake Taiwan,
assistant US attorney Greg Staples said as the trial got under
way in Santa Ana, California.


China and Taiwan have been separated since the end of the Chinese
civil war in 1949 and Beijing views the island as a renegade
province to be retaken, by force if necessary.


The 66-year-old engineer was arrested in 2005 with his wife at
his California home.


China's intelligence services are the most active in the world in
spying on the US and are waging a "very aggressive" campaign to
obtain US military secrets, Joel Brenner, the new head of the
Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, said this
month.
