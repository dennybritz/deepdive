The Iranian consulate in Iraq's southern city of Basra accused
British forces of briefly storming and surrounding its office
during a shootout with gunmen on Thursday.


The British military flatly denied any such incident, maintaining
that its soldiers came under small arms fire during a routine
patrol in the vicinity of the Iranian consulate but did not leave
their vehicles.
