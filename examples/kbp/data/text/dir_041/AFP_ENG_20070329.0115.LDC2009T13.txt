Two Ethiopian helicopters fired missiles on southern Mogadishu
Thursday after heavy fighting with insurgents in which at least
10 people were killed, an AFP correspondent said.


The Ethiopians fired the missiles near their base at the former
Somali defence ministry headquarters, where many recent insurgent
attacks have taken place.


Ethiopian tanks deployed into southern neighbourhoods late
Wednesday before launching the Thursday offensive.


"This morning the Ethiopians launched an operation in the
southern part of the city," said an officer from African Union
peacekeeping troops also deployed in Mogadishu, but not involved
in the offensive.


"For us, our main concern is civilian casualties," he said,
asking not to be named.


Heavy fighting broke out early Thursday between Ethiopian troops
and insurgents, killing at least 10 civilians and smashing a
shaky six-day old ceasefire.


Thursday's fighting crushed hopes that the truce with the Hawiye
clan, which has largely controlled the Somali capital since 1991,
could be maintained.


At least 10 civilians were killed in crossfire in southern
neighbourhoods of Mogadishu, witnesses and an AFP correspondent
said.


Last Friday's ceasefire deal came after some of the deadliest
fighting since the government and its Ethiopian allies drove out
powerful Islamists from southern and central Somalia three months
ago.
