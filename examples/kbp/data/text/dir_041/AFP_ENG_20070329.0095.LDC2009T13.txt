The French unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent in February from
8.5 percent in January, a newspaper reported on Thursday,
signalling the lowest rate since June 1983.


Official unemployment data was to be published later in the day,
and the employment ministry declined to comment on the figures
published by the business newspaper Les Echos.


High unemployment has been a top political issue for years in
France which goes to the polls on April 22 in the first round of
a presidential election.
