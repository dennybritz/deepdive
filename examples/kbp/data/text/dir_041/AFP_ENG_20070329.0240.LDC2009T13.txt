The European Union said on Thursday it is "deeply concerned" by
continuing repression in Zimbabwe, and called on President Robert
Mugabe's government to open dialogue with political opponents.


"We are deeply concerned by disturbing recent developments in
Zimbabwe," Germany's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva,
Michael Steiner, told a session of the UN Human Rights Council
here.


Steiner referred to the violent suppression of peaceful
demonstrations by opposition organisations on March 11, as well
as the arrest and beatings suffered by Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangarai and other officials on
March 18.


"Such actions have no place in any society," Steiner said.


He called on Zimbabwe's government to "commence, immediately, a
sincere and constructive dialogue with opposition parties and
other civil society members".


Apart from the political unrest, rampant inflation and mass
unemployment has led around three million Zimbabweans to
emigrate.


Mugabe, who led his country to independence from British rule in
1980, has been defiant in the face of Western criticism, saying
his critics can "go hang".
