Britain on Thursday stood by its demand for Iran to release 15
sailors and marines detained last week, reiterating that Tehran's
assertion that they were in Iranian waters was "wrong."


"We continue to press strongly for their immediate release," a
Foreign Office spokeswoman told AFP, when asked about a report
that Iran is demanding London admit its personnel were in Iranian
waters when seized.


The spokesman recalled that Prime Minister Tony Blair had said
the Iranian actions were "completely unacceptable, wrong and
illegal."


"We're still awaiting further details from the Iranian government
on their undertaking to act on our request for consular access to
the Royal Navy personnel," she reiterated.


The comments came after a report that Iran's foreign minister
Manouchehr Mottaki had demanded that London admit its personnel
mistakenly entered Iranian waters, as a condition for the release
of the sole female detainee.
