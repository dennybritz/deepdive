DSG International, Europe's biggest electrical retailer, said on
Thursday that it has identified a "significant fraud operation"
at the Parisian warehouse operations of its Fotovista unit.


"French police are investigating and several operatives at the
warehouse and external individuals have been arrested," Britain-
based DSG said in a statement.


DSG warned that it expects the issue to offset profit
contributions from its new businesses this year.


In early London trade, the share price in DSG was showing a loss
of 0.06 percent at 170.4 pence. The FTSE 100 index of leading
shares, on which DSG is traded, was up 0.46 percent at 6,296.0
points.


Fotovista owns Pixmania -- which DSG describes as the only pan-
European e-tailer of digital photographic and consumer electronic
goods.


Meanwhile in a separate statement on Thursday, DSG said Fotovista
has sold its personal photography businesses Primaphot and Maine
Color to investors led by LFPI Gestion for 22.4 million euros
(30.1 million dollars) in cash.
