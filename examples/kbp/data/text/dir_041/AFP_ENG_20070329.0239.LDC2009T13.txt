The United Nation's Kosovo mediator Martti Ahtisaari "will fail"
if he pursues his current plan for the province, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday.


"This problem can't be solved without taking into account the
positions of the two conflicting sides, Belgrade and Pristina.
Ahtisaari has decided to ignore them, but I think he will fail,"
Lavrov was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.
