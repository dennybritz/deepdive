The Swiss government raised its forecast for growth of the
economy this year to 2.0 percent on Thursday from 1.7 percent
forecast in December.


The ministry said it had raised its target in view of strength of
the world economy and robust economic activity in Switzerland.


In 2006, gross domestic product grew by 2.7 percent, the highest
rate since 2000.


The government held its forecast for growth in 2008 at 1.7
percent.
