EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said Thursday that he had
told the Iranian foreign minister that the seizure of 15 British
sailors was "unacceptable" and promised Britain "solidarity".


Speaking before the European Parliament, Solana said that he had
raised the issue of the escalating crisis on Wednesday with
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki.


"I told him very clearly and very plainly that for the European
Union it is unacceptable that these British sailors are held," he
told EU lawmakers. "European solidarity will work fully for their
liberation."


"We hope that in the coming days and coming weeks the Iranian
leaders will show wisdom to resolve this problem with Great
Britain," he added.


Speaking on Wednesday as the head of the EU's presidency, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel also told EU parliamentarians that the
seizure of the sailors was "unacceptable" and promised "full
solidarity" to resolve the crisis.


Iran claims they had entered its waters illegally and has defied
mounting pressure to free the whole group but has said it will
release the only woman among them.
