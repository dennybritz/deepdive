The high-profile son of Bangladesh's outgoing prime minister
appeared in court Thursday to hear extortion charges and that his
trial will be moved to a fast- track tribunal.


The lawyer of Tareque Rahman, the eldest son of Khaleda Zia and
slain president Ziaur Rahman, said the charges were "politically
motivated" and criticised the decision to wrap up a trial within
45 days from April 5, when the hearings will begin.


"The case has been transferred to the speedy trial court and the
trial of Tareque will begin on April 5," prosecution official
Shahidul Haque Bhuiyan told AFP.


Rahman, widely seen as being groomed to take the leadership of
Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is among some 45
influential figures who have been detained on suspicion of
corruption since emergency rule was imposed in January.


He and his personal secretary are accused of extorting 10 million
taka (144 million dollars) from a businessman.


The detentions are part of a major anti-graft crackdown by the
country's new military-backed interim government.


"The charges are all baseless and politically motivated,"
Rahman's lawyer Naushad Jamir said.


"He cannot be tried in a speedy trial court... (and) we will make
an appeal so that the case should be tried, if at all, at a
regular court," he added.


The caretaker government took over on January 12, after President
Iajuddin Ahmed stepped down as head of the earlier interim
government.


He also cancelled disputed elections, which the opposition said
had been rigged by the BNP, and imposed emergency rule.


The new government has pledged to clean up Bangladesh's
notoriously corrupt politics before holding credible elections.
