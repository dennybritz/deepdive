A suicide bomber blew himself up close to an army camp in eastern
Pakistan on Thursday, killing a soldier and wounding seven
others, officials said.


The attacker struck next to a military vehicle in Kharian, 135
kilometers (85 miles) southeast of the capital Islamabad, near an
army drivers' training centre, chief military spokesman Major
General Waheed Arshad said.


"It was a suicide bombing. There are two casualties, one was the
suicide bomber and the other was a member of military personnel,"
Arshad told AFP.


"The soldiers were sitting near their vehicle outside the
garrison area and the bomber came and blew himself up."


Another security official said that one soldier was killed and
seven were wounded. "All were army men," the official told AFP on
condition of anonymity.


The attack comes two days after gunmen on motorbikes hurled
grenades and opened fire on an army vehicle in a Pakistani tribal
area, killing five members of the powerful military-run Inter
Services Intelligence spy agency.
