SAP, the world's leading maker of business software, said late
Wednesday that board member Shai Agassi, lined up to succeed
chief executive Henning Kagermann, was quitting.


Agassi, 39, was leaving on April 1 "by mutual agreement with the
company ... to more quickly commit himself to his personal agenda
of environmental policy and alternative energy sources, and other
issues," SAP said in a statement.


"While we regret Shai's decision to leave, we congratulate him on
his record of achievement at SAP," said supervisory board chief
and one of the company's co- founder, Hasso Plattner.


"I had shared with Shai my plan that he should become successor
to Henning Kagermann as a co-CEO for SAP. With the extension of
Henning's contract to 2009, it became apparent that Shai was not
comfortable committing to a 10-15 year period which was not in
keeping with his personal career timeline.


"Given this, I made the recommendation to the supervisory board
that we change our plans and now adjust SAP's executive
management team responsibilities," Plattner said.


Leo Apotheker, head of sales, had been appointed deputy CEO of
the group, SAP added.
