A top Iranian official said on Thursday that Tehran will not
release a female British sailor detained with 14 male colleagues
as previously promised because of London's "incorrect attitude."


The announcment by the head of Iran's supreme national security
council Ali Larijani came a day after London announced it was
freezing ties with Tehran over the crisis.


Iran had said on Wednesday that Faye Turney, the only woman among
the 15 sailors captured in Gulf waters on Friday, would be
released within a day or two.
