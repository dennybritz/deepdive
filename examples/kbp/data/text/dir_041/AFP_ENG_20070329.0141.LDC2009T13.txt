One of South Africa's most prestigious universities, The
University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, has appointed
the first black chancellor in its 83-year history.


The country's deputy chief justice, Dikgang Moseneke, who spent
10 years detained on Robben Island under apartheid, said it was
through education that South Africa's social ills could be
overcome.


"I believe that it is through the education and empowerment of
South Africans, that the social ills like poverty and unwellness
that plague our nation, will be overcome," said Moseneke, who was
installed as chancellor on Wednesday.


"It is through our advancement in science and technology that we
will address the skills shortage in our country and bridge the
racial, class and cultural gaps that divide our country."


Moseneke was never able to attend a university like Wits, which
was itself mired in racism.


However more than half of the university's registered students
are now black, and it boasts four Nobel prize laureates,
including former South African president Nelson Mandela.


More than 75 languages are spoken at the multi-cultural
university.


The new chancellor spoke out against HIV/AIDS as well as
neighbouring Zimbabwe's spiralling economic and political crisis.


"I would be entirely remiss if, as a judge in this country, I
were to assume a pose of convenient silence on the difficult
circumstances of our northern neighbour, Zimbabwe.


"I have little or no doubt that one of the adverse consequences
of the colonial experience is land dispossession followed by land
hunger," he said.
