Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the West Bank on
Thursday, and a Gaza militant died of wounds received in an
Israeli strike the previous day, medics and security sources
said.


Ahmad Assasah, 20, was killed by fire from Israeli soldiers who
had come to arrested wanted militants in a village near the
northern city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank.


Two others were wounded in the incident, during which two
suspected militants were arrested, security sources said.


An army spokeswoman said soldiers had opened fire at "an armed
Palestinian" standing on a roof after having come under fire in
the village.


Further south, in a village near the city of Nablus, the army
arrested Mohammad Kataneh, saying he was a local chief of the
radical Islamic Jihad group.


In Gaza, an Islamic Jihad militant, Said Abu Wardeh, 20, died of
wounds sustained during an Israeli strike on Wednesday. That was
the first military action against gunmen in the coastal strip
since a November 26 ceasefire.


Four other militants were wounded in the strike, which hit their
car in the northern town of Beit Lahiya.


The army said it had targetted militants planning to fire a
rocket on the Jewish state. Nine rockets fired from Gaza struck
Israel on Wednesday, it said.


Thursday's deaths bring to 5,653 the number of people killed
since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September
2000, the vast majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP
count.
