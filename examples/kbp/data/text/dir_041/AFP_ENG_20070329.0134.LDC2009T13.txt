Kuwait has ordered the culling of about 1.1 million chickens in a
bid to fight an outbreak of bird flu, an official was quoted as
saying on Thursday.


The head of the agriculture authority, Jassem al-Bader, told Al-
Siyyassah newspaper the culling will take place "in the coming
few days" at farms owned by three major companies.


The farms are located in Wafra, south of Kuwait City on the Saudi
border, where most of the 57 cases of H5N1 virus have been
detected since the outbreak was announced on February 25.


Since the outbreak began, authorities have culled close to
200,000 fowls which were in contact with infected birds. No human
case had been detected.


A team of experts from the World Organisation for Animal Health
arrived in Kuwait on March 5 to help the authorities and assess
the situation.


The Gulf emirate has slapped a total ban on the import and export
of birds, closed down bird markets and shut the only zoo.
Authorities have also closed down hundreds of shops selling live
chickens.


In November 2005, Kuwait announced the first case of a bird
infected with the deadly H5N1 strain -- a flamingo at a seaside
villa.


The H5N1 strain, the most aggressive form, has killed more than
160 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation,
and seen millions of birds destroyed.


H5N1 is an avian influenza subtype with pandemic potential, since
it might ultimately adapt into a strain that is contagious among
humans.
