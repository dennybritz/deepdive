The NBA will play matches in China this year for only the second
time in its history, one of which will pit the Chinese national
team against Orlando Magic, officials said here Thursday.


"Our fans will get to see first hand, exciting match-ups
featuring the best young players in the NBA and China," Heidi
Ueberroth, president of global operations for the NBA, said in
Shanghai.


Led by forward Dwight Howard, the Magic will meet the Chinese
national team in the former Portuguese colony of Macau following
a fixture against the playoff- bound Cleveland Cavaliers.


The three games scheduled for between October 17-20 will first
tip-off in Shanghai, home of Houston Rockets star centre Yao
Ming, pitting the Magic against LeBron James's Cavaliers.


The exhibition games are the NBA's second fixtures in China as
the top basketball league looks to expand its fan base in the
world's most populous nation.


In 2004, Chinese fans saw Yao and his Houston Rockets play two
matches in Shanghai and Beijing amid much hype for the potential
scheduling of annual exhibition games in basketball-mad China.


The games were the first here by any American professional sports
league and the first Chinese appearance by an NBA club since
Washington played China's national team in 1979.
