India on Thursday successfully test fired a domestically made
air-to-air missile for the second time in four days, defence
officials said.


The Astra missile was fired from the Integrated Test Range at
Chandipur-on-sea, 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Orissa's
capital Bhubaneswar, the officials said.


The single-stage solid-fuel missile, first successfully tested in
May 2003, can carry a 15 kilogramme (33 pound) conventional
warhead and has a strike-range of 20 to 80 kilometres.


The test comes a week after neighbouring Pakistan test-fired a
nuclear-capable radar-dodging cruise missile with a range of 700
kilometres.


The neighbours have routinely conducted missile tests since
carrying out tit- for-tat nuclear detonations in May 1998.


Tensions have, however, eased since 2004 when they launched a
peace process aimed at ending six decades of hostility and
resolving their dispute over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir,
the cause of two of their three wars.
