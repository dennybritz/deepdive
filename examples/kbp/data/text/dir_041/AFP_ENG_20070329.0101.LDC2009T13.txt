Switzerland said Thursday it would not seek the release of a
Swiss man jailed for 10 years in Thailand for insulting the Thai
king.


"We note that the Thai legislation on the basis of which our
compatriot was tried is applied with great rigour," Swiss foreign
ministry spokesman Jean Philippe Jeannerat told AFP after the
sentencing of Oliver Jufer, 57.


Jufer had pleaded guilty to five counts of lese majeste -- the
crime of offending the dignity of a sovereign -- for defacing
portraits of King Bhumibol Adulyadej with spray paint in the
northern Thai city of Chiang Mai.


The lese majeste laws are strictly applied in Thailand.


Jeannerat said the jail term had been applied according to Thai
law and would not comment on the length of the jail term. Swiss
authorities would not ask the Thai government to free Jufer, he
said, highlighting that Jufer has one month to appeal.


"The Swiss government does not intervene with authorities in
cases where the procedure followed conformed to basic judicial
principles," said the spokesman.


"Our compatriot was arrested on the basis of clearly established
legislation. He knows why he was arrested, he had the assistance
of a defence lawyer and he has the possibility to appeal,"
Jeannerat said.


Jufer has been living in Thailand for about 10 years and has a
Thai wife. He was arrested in December as the country celebrated
the 79th birthday of its revered monarch.


While drunk, he was filmed by security cameras spray painting the
king's portraits.
