Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro blasted US President George W.
Bush Thursday in his first signed press article since undergoing
surgery eight months ago.


Castro, who has temporarily handed power to his brother while
recovering from a gastrointestinal operation, accused Bush of
condemning more than three billion people to a "premature death"
by promoting the use of biofuels.
