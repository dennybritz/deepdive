Sichuan Changhong Electric Co., one of China's leading TV
manufacturers, has opened a production facility in the Czech
Republic, state media said Thursday.


The project, which was inaugurated Wednesday, is the first
overseas production base wholly owned by a Chinese home
electrical appliance enterprise, the Xinhua news agency said.


The 10-million-dollar project has a designed annual production
capacity of one million sets, mostly flat-panel and high-
definition TVs, according to the agency.


The company aims to gradually expand the production to also
include air conditioners, refrigerators, cellphones and set-top
boxes, in order to sell all Changhong products in Europe, Xinhua
reported.
