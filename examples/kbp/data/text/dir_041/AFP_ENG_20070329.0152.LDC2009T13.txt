An Israeli court on Thursday handed a lenient sentence to former
justice minister Haim Ramon after his conviction for sexual
misconduct, clearing the way for him to remain in parliament and
regain a ministerial post.


A Tel Aviv court sentenced Ramon, a close ally of Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert, to 120 hours of community service and fined him
15,000 shekels (3,300 dollars), following his January 31
conviction.


But the court declined to qualify his offence as "disgraceful,"
which would have prevented him from serving in parliament or
regaining a minister's chair.


The Ramon case is one of a number of cases of corruption or
wrongdoing in Israel that has seen Olmert's approval ratings
plummet, with one poll saying  he is trusted by only two percent
of Israelis.


Ramon, 56, resigned in August after he was accused of forcefully
kissing a female soldier at a party last July 12, the day Israel
launched its devastating war against Lebanon's Hezbollah militia.
He denied the charges.


Ramon helped found Olmert's centrist Kadima party with former
premier Ariel Sharon and is considered one of the closest allies
of the beleaguered premier.


There are several graft probes against Olmert and a looming rape
indictment against President Moshe Katsav, who has since taken a
leave of absence from the largely ceremonial post.
