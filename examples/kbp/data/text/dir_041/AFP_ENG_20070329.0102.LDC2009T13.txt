The number of people out of work in Germany, the eurozone's
biggest economy, fell by 114,000 to 4.108 million in March, the
Federal Labour Agency said on Thursday.


The German jobless rate, which measures the total number of
people out of work against the working population as a whole,
slipped by 0.3 percentage point to 9.8 percent this month, the
office said in a statement.


Unemployment usually declines in the spring as a result of mild
weather.


That factor and the ongoing economic upturn meant that jobless
queues shortened more than expected this month, office chief
Frank Weise said.


Adjusted for seasonal effects, the German jobless total fell by
65,000 to 3.832 million, with the adjusted jobless rate falling
to 9.2 percent from 9.3 percent.


Analysts had been expected a more modest decline of around
50,000.


A regional breakdown of the numbers showed that unemployment in
the economically more active west of Germany decreased by 46,000
to 2.534 million in seasonally adjusted terms this month,
reducing the adjusted jobless rate to 7.6 percent from 7.8
percent.


And in the former communist east, the seasonally adjusted jobless
total was down by 19,000 at 1.298 million, cutting the jobless
rate to 15.2 percent from 15.4 percent.
