Bombings and shootings killed at least 12 people in and around
Baghdad on Thursday as deadly violence continued to engulf the
war-torn country, security officials said.


In the biggest attack, five people were killed and nearly 20
wounded when a car bomb exploded in the town of Mahmudiyah, 30
kilometres (20 miles) south of Baghdad, police said.


In the capital, two policemen died when a car rigged with
explosives and stuffed with a corpse blew up when they came to
retrieve the body, a security official said.


Iraqi policemen, who are a daily target for Sunni insurgents
opposed to the Shiite-led government, found the car parked in the
Al-Amel district of central Baghdad with a corpse inside.


When the policemen approached to examine the body, the vehicle
exploded, killing two of them and wounding another six, the
security official said.


Another two policemen were killed and two more wounded when
gunmen opened fire on the traffic police chief's convoy as it
passed through a district of northern Baghdad near the Sunni al-
Nida mosque, an official said.


Three more Iraqis were killed and another 20 wounded in a
roadside bomb explosion in southwestern Baghdad's Baya district.


Iraqi and US troops last month launched a massive crackdown in
and around Baghdad, deploying 80,000 soldiers in the streets in a
bid to wrest back control of the war-torn capital from insurgents
and sectarian killings.


Iraq continues to battle a deadly bout of violence that has left
more than 150 people killed in the past three days, most of them
in sectarian bloodshed in the northern town of Tal Afar.
