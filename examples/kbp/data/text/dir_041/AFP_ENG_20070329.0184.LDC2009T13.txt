American Natalie Coughlin swam the second-fastest time in history
to qualify for the women's 100-metre freestyle final at the world
championships here Thursday.


Coughlin, who broke her world record in winning the 100m
backstroke gold medal on Tuesday, clocked a championship record
53.40 seconds to be just shy of Britta Steffen's world record of
53.30.


She will have the coveted lane four in Friday's final ahead of
Australia's former world record holder Libby Lenton (53.85) and
Steffen (54.05).


"I had no idea how fast I was going. I have been experimenting
staying under water longer," Coughlin said. "It obviously helps,
so I am going to do that again."


But Lenton is planning on a big swim in Friday's final in front
of her home fans.


"All the girls are strong enough and fit enough, but I am going
to step it up and have go," she said.


Steffen, who set the world record of 53.30sec at last year's
European championships in Budapest, gets her chance for gold
after a disappointing meet for the Germans.
