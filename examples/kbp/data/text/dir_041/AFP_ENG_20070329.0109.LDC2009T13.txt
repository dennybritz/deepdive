German department store operator KarstadtQuelle said Thursday
that it swung back to profit as the deep restructuring of the
past two years begins to bear fruit.


KarstadtQuelle said in a statement it booked bottom-line net
profit of 346 million euros (460 million dollars) in 2006,
compared with a loss of 316 million euros a year earlier.


"We achieved all our earnings targets in 2006," the group said.


"The tourism business of Thomas Cook posted a record result,
Karstadt earnings more than doubled and the mail order division
initiated the strategic realignment to achieve break-even at the
end of this year."
