Malaysia's budget carrier AirAsia has signed a three-year
sponsorship deal with racing team Williams beginning with the
2007 Formula One season, a top official said Thursday.


"F1 is a sport we would love to be associated with. We would love
to be a global brand," AirAsia's chief executive Tony Fernandes
told AFP.


Fernandes declined to reveal the financial details of the
sponsorship which was signed three weeks ago in Britain.


"AirAsia believes in branding and believes in return of
investments. We are already reaping the gains from our Manchester
United investment," he said.


AirAsia is the second Malaysian company to sponsor a F1 car.
National oil company Petronas sponsors BMW Sauber.


The bright red AirAsia logo was fixed on the nose of Williams'
race car during the practice session at Sepang Circuit here with
German Nico Rosberg behind the wheels.


AirAsia's Formula One partnership comes after the carrier entered
into a sponsorship deal with Manchester United in 2005.


AirAsia recently announced net profit for the six months to
December soared to 227 million ringgit (64.7 million dollars)
from 59.9 million ringgit.


AirAsia was launched as a budget carrier in 2001 with just two
aircraft. It now offers more than 100 domestic and international
flights to Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
