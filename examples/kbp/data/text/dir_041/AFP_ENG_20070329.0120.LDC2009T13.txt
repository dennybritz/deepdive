Hong Kong share prices closed 1.37 percent higher Thursday in a
technical rebound after two days of falls, with CNOOC and China
Unicom posting steep gains ahead of their 2006 results, dealers
said.


They said the market was supported by last-minute buying ahead of
the settlement of March futures as well as some end-quarter
window-dressing.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 267.91 points at 19,821.78, off a
high of 19,832.14 and a low of 19,460.36. Turnover was 56.52
billion Hong Kong dollars (7.3 billion US).
