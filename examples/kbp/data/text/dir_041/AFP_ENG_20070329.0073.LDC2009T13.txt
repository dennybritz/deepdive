European stock markets rallied slightly in opening deals on
Thursday, with London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares climbing
0.11 percent to 6,273.90 points.


Frankfurt's DAX 30 advanced 0.25 percent to 6,834.09 points and
in Paris the CAC 40 index gained 0.49 percent to 5,579.99.


Europe's three main indices had slid Wednesday, mainly owing to
surging crude oil prices which increase companies' costs and
comments by Fed chairman Bernanke, who said that the outlook for
the depressed US housing market was "uncertain".
