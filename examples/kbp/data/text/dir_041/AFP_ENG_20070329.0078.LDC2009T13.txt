A Japanese man inspired by the sight of a luxurious British
cruise liner managed to sneak himself onboard for a free one-week
voyage before being caught in Hawaii, police said Thursday.


Osamu Ikegame, 40, said he could not stop himself when he saw the
Aurora docked in Yokohama and climbed a 2.5-metre (eight-foot)
fence at the harbour, according to police.


Ikegame then successfully blended in with the crowd of about
1,800 passengers and boarded the round-the-world cruise on March
20, said a spokesman for harbour police in Yokohama, south of
Tokyo.


But the free ride ended in Hawaii for Ikegame after the cruise
operator found out he had no ticket.


"He told police that he wanted to go overseas on the big ship,"
said the police spokesman.


"There must have been a couple of checkpoints before he got on
the ship," the spokesman said. "We are investigating how he went
through those checkpoints."


Ikegame -- who is not known to have a regular job but described
himself as a computer engineer -- was arrested Thursday on
charges of unlawful entry at the harbour, a day after police flew
him back home from Honolulu.


The 270-metre long Aurora departed Britain's Southampton port on
January 9 for a three-month round-the-world cruise.


The least expensive cabin on the Aurora costs 17,000 pounds
(33,400 dollars) for the full trip before any discounts,
according to the website of operator P and O Cruises.
