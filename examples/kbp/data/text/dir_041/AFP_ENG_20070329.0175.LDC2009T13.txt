UN chief Ban Ki-moon discussed Iran's detention of 15 British
naval personnel with Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki
in Riyadh on Thursday, a UN source accompanying Ban told AFP.


"The issue of the British soldiers was addressed by the secretary
general" during a meeting which lasted over one hour, the source
said, requesting anonymity.


The spokesman could not give further details or say whether
access to the 15 personnel was discussed during the meeting,
which he said focused "mainly on the Iranian nuclear issue."


Britain says the naval personnel were "ambushed" in Iraqi waters,
while Iran maintains they were in its territory when they were
detained last week.
