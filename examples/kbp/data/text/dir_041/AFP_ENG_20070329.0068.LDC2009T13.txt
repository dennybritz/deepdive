Four Iraqi policemen were killed on Thursday, including two who
died when a car rigged with explosives and stuffed with a corpse
blew up when they came to retrieve the body, a official said.


Iraqi policemen, who are a daily target for Sunni insurgents
opposed to the Shiite-led government, found the car parked in the
Al-Amel district of central Baghdad with a corpse inside.


When the policemen approached to examine the body, the vehicle
exploded, killing two of them and wounding another six, the
security official said.


Another two policemen were killed and two more wounded when
gunmen opened fire on the traffic police chief's convoy as it
passed through a district of northern Baghdad near the Sunni al-
Nida mosque, an official said.


Iraqi and US troops last month launched a massive crackdown in
and around Baghdad, deploying 80,000 soldiers in the streets in a
bid to wrest back control of the war-torn capital from insurgents
and sectarian killings.
