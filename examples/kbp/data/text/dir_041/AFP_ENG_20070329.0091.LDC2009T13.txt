Two Ethiopian helicopters fired missiles on southern Mogadishu
Thursday after heavy fighting with insurgents in which at least
10 people were killed, an AFP correspondent said.


Ethiopian troops fired the missiles near their base at the former
Somali defence ministry headquarters, where there have been a lot
of recent insurgent attacks.


Four Ethiopian helicopters arrived earlier at Mogadishu airport.
