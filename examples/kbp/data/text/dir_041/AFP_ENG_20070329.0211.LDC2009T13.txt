CNOOC, the country's top offshore oil producer, reported a 22.1
percent increase to 30.93 billion yuan (4 billion US) on the back
of increased oil output and higher crude oil prices.


This was in line with analysts forecast of 28.77 billion and
31.24 billion yuan.


Chairman and chief executive officer Fu Chengyu said the
improvement in the group's earnings for the year was "primarily
due to our increased production and the higher price of oil."


He said sales for the year jumped 28 percent to 88.9 billion yuan
from 69.5 billion a year earlier, while operating profit rose to
43 billion yuan from 36.1 billion in the previous year.


The company generated revenue of 68 billion yuan from oil and gas
sales, up 27 percent over the same period of last year.


The group produced 167 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2006,
up 7.9 percent year-on-year, including 136 million barrels of oil
and 179 billion cubic feet of natural gas.


"Despite 2006 was a year full of challenges, the production and
reserves growth did not slow down. I'm proud of the company's
significant progress in oil and gas exploration, development and
production in 2006," said President Zhou Shouwei in a statement.


CNOOC reported good progress in exploration and production during
the year with 10 oil and gas discoveries, including the first
deepwater discovery offshore China-Liwan 3-1, and 6 appraisal
successes offshore China.
