Australian pursuit champion Phillip Thuaux is in a race to
recover in time for the team event here at the world track
cycling championships after picking up a stomach bug.


Thuaux, along with Zakkari Dempster, is hoping to join Peter
Dawson, Matthew Goss and Mark Jamieson for Friday's 16-lap
endurance event in which the Aussies are the reigning world and
Olympic champions and world record holders.


Australia will not give up their coveted title easily although
Britain, on form and inspired by the recent return of Olympic
individual pursuit champion Bradley Wiggins, will be tough to
beat.


Australian team bosses have yet to choose who will join the trio
of Dawson, Goss and Jamieson.


Thuaux, who has been sick since Wednesday, had to pull out of the
men's individual pursuit event on Thursday's first day of
competition.


On Friday Australia will still be hoping to show the on-form
Brits who the kings of the 16-lap race really are.


"I believe we have a slightly better team than last year, so
while not being over-confident we believe we'll be around the
mark," Australia's endurance coach, Ian McKenzie, told AFP.
