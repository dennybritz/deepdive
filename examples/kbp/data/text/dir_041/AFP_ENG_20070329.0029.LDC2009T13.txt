South Korea's Seoul city government said Thursday it has approved
a plan to build the world's second-highest skyscraper in the
central business district, officials said.


The state-run Korea Railroad Corp's plan to build a 150-story
building, measuring 615 metres (2,029.5 feet) high, by 2013 in
Yongsan was endorsed on Wednesday, city government officials
said.


The city's urban construction committee set the ceiling on the
planned building's height at 620 metres, they said.


The building would be the world's second-highest after the Burj
Dubai, a tower now under construction in the United Arab Emirates
that will reach 830 metres high, they added.


The Korea Railroad Corp said it would need consultations with the
city government -- as both still remain at odds over other terms
and conditions of the development project -- before the
construction.
