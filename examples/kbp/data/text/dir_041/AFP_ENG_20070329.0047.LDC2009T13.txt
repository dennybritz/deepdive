Kyrgyz Prime Minister Azim Isabekov tendered his resignation on
Thursday in a bid to preserve national stability, a government
spokeswoman told AFP.


Isabekov resigned "in order to preserve the stability of the
country," spokeswoman Roza Daudova told AFP.


The office of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev said the president had
accepted the resignation and had appointed moderate opposition
figure Almaz Atambayev as interim prime minister.


He has been tasked with forming a new government.


Bakiyev "accepted the resignation and has named Almaz Atambayev
as interim prime minister," the president's spokesman, Dosaly
Esenaliyev, said.


The change of prime minister came after Bakiyev refused to
authorize Isabekov's decision to sack seven cabinet members on
Wednesday, amid growing political uncertainty in this Central
Asian state.


Opposition leaders have threatened a major protest for next
month, amid continued instability following an uprising in March
2005 in which Bakiyev's predecessor was ousted.
