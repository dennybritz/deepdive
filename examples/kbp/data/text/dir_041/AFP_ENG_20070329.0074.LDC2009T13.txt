Defending champion and world record holder Brendan Hansen was
forced out of the 200m breaststroke at the world championships
Thursday with intestinal problems that left him doubled up.


The American star fell ill on Wednesday evening after returning
from the pool where he won silver in the 50m breaststroke final.


"I was on the bus with him Wednesday night and he was feeling
feverish and feeling really lousy. He knew he was coming down
with something," said US head coach Mark Schubert.


"We put him in a room by himself and he had a rough night. He
didn't sleep all night and had intestinal problems. Then today he
went for a little swim just to see (how he felt).


"There's a 25m pool at the hotel where we're staying and he swam
one length and couldn't do it. The swimming wasn't the problem,
it was the intestinal problems and he was just doubled over.


"The doctor saw him and said 'he can't swim'."


Hansen became the most successful breaststroker in world
championship history with victory over rival Kosuke Kitajima to
retain his 100m crown Monday, and was keen to renew his battle
with the Japanese star in the 200m.


Asked if the illness could be attributed to food, Schubert
replied: "It's not food, it's viral. He's on antiviral medication
and we hope it'll make a difference for the men's 4x100m medley
relay.


"He's very disappointed. He's been training all year and he's at
the top of his game, but he's mature enough to know that it's not
his fault and that there's nothing he can do about it but get
better. It just happens."
