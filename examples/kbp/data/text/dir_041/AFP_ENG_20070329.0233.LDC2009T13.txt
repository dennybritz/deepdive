Thailand's army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont on
Thursday rejected calls from the nation's ruling junta to impose
emergency rule in Bangkok to crack down on anti-coup protests.


"The current situation is not serious enough to require emergency
rule," he said.


"But the government is prepared in case the situation worsens,
and I am empowered" to declare a state of emergency, he added.


"The government will try to talk with every party to prevent the
situation from deteriorating to that point," he said.


"I don't want to see clashes among Thai people," he added.


Surayud spoke one day after the junta leader, General Sonthi
Boonyaratglin, told AFP that he wanted the government to declare
an emergency in Bangkok to crack down on swelling protests.


Authorities in Bangkok said Thursday that they had decided to
close a park where protesters had planned to stage a new rally
Friday.
