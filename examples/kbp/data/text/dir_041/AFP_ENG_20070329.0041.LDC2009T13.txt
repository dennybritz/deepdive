Citigroup Inc aims to double the number of its consumer bank
outlets in China to more than 30 this year, Chairman and Chief
Executive Charles Prince said Thursday.


"We intend to accelerate network expansion with the aim of
reaching more than 30 at the end of 2007", Prince told reporters
at a media briefing in Beijing.


Currently, Citigroup operates 16 consumer bank outlets, six
corporate bank branches, two investment bank representative
offices and one representative office in the country.


Citigroup is one of four foreign banks that won regulatory
approval last week to incorporate locally in China, allowing them
unconfined access to China's two trillion dollars of household
savings.


As locally incorporated entities, the four lenders can provide
unrestricted local-currency services to Chinese citizens.


"We want to be the leading, most customer-focused international
bank in China," Prince said.


The US financial service giant also wanted to expand investment
banking business in China.


"In addition to our consumer business, another important priority
this year is to continue to build up our investment banking
business here in China and to be an active participant of the
development of the capital markets," he said.
