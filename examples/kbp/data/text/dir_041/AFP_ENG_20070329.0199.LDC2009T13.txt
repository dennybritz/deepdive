UN chief Ban Ki-moon discussed Iran's detention of 15 British
naval personnel with Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki
in Riyadh on Thursday, a UN source accompanying Ban told AFP.


"The issue of the British soldiers was addressed by the secretary
general" during a meeting which lasted over one hour, the source
said, requesting anonymity.


The spokesman could not give further details or say whether
access to the 15 personnel was discussed during the meeting,
which he said focused "mainly on the Iranian nuclear issue."


Britain says the naval personnel were "ambushed" in Iraqi waters,
while Iran maintains they were in its territory when they were
detained last week.


Both Ban and Mottaki came to the Saudi capital to attend
Wednesday's opening session of the annual Arab summit and were
also due to attend the closing session on Thursday.


Britain on Thursday maintained demands that Iran give access to
the 15 detained personnel amid a nervous wait to see if Iran
would make good on a promise to free the only woman captive.


There was widespread anger in Britain at television images of the
15 shown by Iranian television and an interview with the woman,
Faye Turney, in which she admitted the Britons had trespassed
into Iranian waters.


The crisis over the detention of the 15 Britons comes to the
backdrop of Iran's standoff with the West over its controversial
nuclear programme.
