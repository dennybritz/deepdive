A prominent former judge was arrested in Australia Thursday,
ending an astonishing saga involving a speeding fine and a
mystery driver that has gripped Australia for months.


Marcus Einfeld, 67, a human rights lawyer and international
jurist who was formerly a Federal Court judge, was charged with a
total of 13 offences including perjury and perverting the course
of justice, police said.


A special police strike force was established last August to
investigate allegations in a newspaper that Einfeld gave false
evidence to avoid a 77 (61 US) dollar fine after his car was
caught by a speed camera.


Einfeld had told a local court he was not driving and had lent
his car to an old friend, US-based academic Professor Teresa
Brennan, who had since died.


A newspaper reported later that a Professor Teresa Brennan had
died after a car accident in the US in 2003 -- three years before
the judge's car was driven through the speed trap.


Einfeld denied any wrongdoing but was hounded relentlessly by
journalists who checked his every statement and frequently held
them up to ridicule.


As the case developed, the government of the small South Pacific
nation of the Solomon Islands axed the respected judge as head of
an inquiry into riots there last April.


The 13 charges against Einfeld relate to four separate traffic
infringements captured on camera.


The offence of perverting the course of justice carries a maximum
penalty of 14 years jail, while the other three offences each
have a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.


The former judge was released on bail.
