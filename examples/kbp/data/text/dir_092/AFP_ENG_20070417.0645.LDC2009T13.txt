A UN probe into the fatal shooting of two protesters at a Kosovo
rally in February said Tuesday that Romanian police were
responsible for the "unnecessary and avoidable" deaths.


Robert Dean, the international prosecutor appointed by the UN
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to conduct the investigation, said
there was "a substantial basis on which to conclude that Romanian
gunners" fired the relevant bullets.


"This is based upon forensic firearms examination of the
projectiles," he said, referring to the rubber bullets removed
from the bodies of the two dead protestors and from a third who
was seriously wounded.


The interim report into the shootings during the February 10
demonstrations outside Pristina's parliament building was not
final and the investigation was continuing, he added.


A Romanian contingent was in charge when international police
shot rubber bullets at some 2,000 ethnic Albanian protestors
after violence broke out during the demonstration.


Two of the protestors suffered fatal head wounds, according to
official autopsies. Dean's team is also examining the shooting of
two more protesters who were seriously wounded during the rally.


The protest was organised by an extremist Kosovo Albanian youth
movement called "Self-determination," which opposes any form of
negotiations with Serbia over Kosovo's future status.


Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia that has been run by the
United Nations and NATO since the end of its 1998-1999 war
between Belgrade-controlled forces and separatist ethnic Albanian
guerillas.
