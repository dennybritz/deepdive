Two in three Russians want President Vladimir Putin to serve a
third term, despite a constitutional two-term limit that would
require him to step down next year, a poll said Tuesday.


Sixty-five percent of those polled said they were favourable or
very favourable to changing the constitution to allow Putin to
serve another term and to make that term seven years, the VTsIOM
polling agency said. Only 24 percent were against the idea.


Presidential terms are currently four years and Putin is required
to step down next year when his second term expires.


Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday reiterated the official
line that Putin has no plans to stand for a third term.


Several politicians have publicly called for Putin to stay on as
president amid widespread concern about the possible instability
a transfer of power could involve.


The VTsIOM poll of 1,600 people across Russia was carried out on
April 7-8 and had a margin of error of less than four percent.
