Norway's justice ministry on Tuesday presented a bill to
parliament that would increase the sentence for acts of terrorism
from the present 21 years in prison to 30, the ministry said in a
statement.


A 30-year sentence would be the lengthiest in the Norwegian
justice system. The ministry said the maximum prison term would
be used in the most severe cases of terrorism that result in the
deaths of a number of people.


The government was however not planning to allow police and
intelligence services to expand their investigation methods, the
statement said.


Al-Qaeda has on several occasions identified Norway as a
potential target.
