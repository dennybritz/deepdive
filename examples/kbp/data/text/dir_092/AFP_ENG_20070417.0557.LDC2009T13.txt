Former Kenyan world marathon record holder turned peacemaker
Tegla Loroupe faces an 11 million shillings (160,701 dollars,
118,457 euros) tax bill, officials said Tuesday.


Loroupe, 33, is required to make arrangement how to repay the
bill accrued from unpaid rental income for the athlete's
premises, according to a Kenya Revenue Authority letter quoted by
local media.


The bill was for income between 1994 and 2000, the letter added.


"Note that unless you issue a proposal on how you pay the tax,
measures will be taken to recover the above tax using methods not
favourable to you," added the letter obtained by the Daily
Nation.


The marathon star, who quit running in 2001, is the founder of
the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation that aims at bringing peace
among fueding comunities in the region.


She is also involved in humanitarian activities.
