The United States wants the international community to act
quickly to help the breakaway Serbian province of Kosovo achieve
independence, a senior US official said Tuesday.


"We must now act quickly in the next weeks and months to finish
the job by helping to lead Kosovo to independence," Nicholas
Burns, the number three official at the US State Department, told
a US Congress panel.
