Prime Minister Stephen Harper lamented in Parliament Tuesday the
death of a Canadian teacher of French at a Virginia university
during a campus mass murder.


"We learned that a Canadian was among the dead in Virginia,"
Harper said.


"It's really almost impossible to comprehend why an individual
would take his own life and that of so many others in this way,
but I think we can all say that our thoughts are with all the
victims, their families and the community."


His sentiment was echoed by opposition Liberal leader Stephane
Dion.


Jocelyne Couture-Nowak had been teaching at Virginia Tech along
with her husband, a horticulture professor. Both had taught at
the Nova Scotia Agricultural College in Truro in eastern Canada
before moving to the United States.


Public broadcaster CBC said Couture-Nowak was originally from
Montreal.


Police say Virginia Tech student Cho Seung-Hui stalked
classrooms, firing on students and professors, before turning his
gun on himself. By midday on Monday, 33 people lay dead on the
campus.
