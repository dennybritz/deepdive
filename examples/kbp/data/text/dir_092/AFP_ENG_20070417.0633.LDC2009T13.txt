Birmingham gave their hopes of automatic promotion to the
Premiership a massive boost with a 2-1 win at relegation-
threatened Leicester on Tuesday.


Early goals from Radhi Jaidi and Sebastian Larsson put Steve
Bruce's side on track for a win that lifts them above Derby and
into second place in the Championship, two points adrift of
leaders Sunderland with three rounds of matches left to play.


Shaun Newton's free-kick gave Leicester hope seven minutes from
time but the Foxes were unable to draw a line under a winless run
that has now reached ten matches.


Leicester are now just two points clear of the relegation zone
and, with a tough run-in, look to be in serious danger of
dropping a division.


In Tuesday's other Championship match, Burnley notched up an
impressive 3-0 win over Norwich, Andy Gray, Ade Akinbiyi and Wade
Elliot finding the net.
