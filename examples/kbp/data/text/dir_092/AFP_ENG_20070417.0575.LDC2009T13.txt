US President George W. Bush on Tuesday mourned the Virgina Tech
massacre as "a day of sadness for our entire nation" as he led
thousands of grieving students and staff at a memorial service.


"In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over
this country are thinking about you," said Bush, who came with
First Lady Laura Bush to pay a somber tribute to the victims of
the deadliest school shooting in US history.


"Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of
sorrow. This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech
community, and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation,"
said the US president.
