Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Tuesday with the
Palestinian finance minister, the highest level US contact yet
with a member of the unity government led by the radical Islamic
group Hamas, a US official said.


Rice met with Salam Fayyad, a respected former World Bank
official and independent member of the Palestinian government,
while he was holding talks "in a private capacity" with Assistant
Secretary of State David Welch, spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said.


Gallegos did not provide details of the discussions, other than
to say they dealt with matters "Fayyad is currently undertaking."


Fayyad was in Washington to attend the spring meetings of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund and has been holding
talks with Western governments to seek additional financial aid
for the beleagured Palestinians.
