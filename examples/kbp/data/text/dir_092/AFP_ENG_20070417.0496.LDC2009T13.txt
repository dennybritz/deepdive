A Moroccan convicted of "terrorism" in Saudi Arabia and
extradited to Morocco at the beginning of the month has gone
before the North African country's anti- terror court, a judicial
source said Tuesday.


Khalid Achline, who served three years in a Saudi prison for
terrorist activities, stands accused of having ties to attacks in
Casablanca in May, 2003, which killed 45 people including the 12
suicide bombers, a judicial source told AFP, requesting
anonymity.


According to the charges, Achline fought in Afghanistan and in
Chechnya and is linked to the Algerian Islamist militant group
GIA.
