A South African housewife is to sue the country's home affairs
minister after she was arrested for prostitution while waiting
for her husband as he made a quick phone call, a report said
Tuesday.


Luarika Louise Vermeulen is to seek 600,000 rand (85,000 US
dollars) in compensation at Port Elizabeth high court over the
incident in May last year which saw her being thrown into the
back of a police van and kept in the cells overnight.


Vermeulen said that she had been waiting on a pavement outside
the Red Lion Hotel as her husband made a phone call to some
friends.


According to the online edition of The Herald newspaper, the 23
-year-old had to undergo medical and psychological treatment
after the incident.


Although she was initially charged with "loitering with the
intent to commit prostitution", the charges were later dropped.


In responding court papers, Home Affairs Minister Charles Nqakula
claimed that her arrest and the conduct of the arresting officers
was lawful because it prevented Vermeulen from committing
prostitution.
