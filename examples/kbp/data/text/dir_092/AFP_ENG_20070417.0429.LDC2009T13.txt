One of Paris' top-end hotels, the luxury Meurice overlooking the
Tuileries gardens, is set for a minimalist makeover by French
designer Philippe Starck, the hotel said.


Asked to confirm a report on luxury travel site
www.globorati.com, a spokeswoman for the hotel said renovation of
the legendary hotel, which was built in 1817 and turned into a
palace in 1907, would begin this year.


Starck, 58, had been asked "to respect the spirit of the
establishment while injecting the chic minimalist 'Starck'
touch," she added.


The hotel, whose 121 rooms go for 510 to 760 euros a night, will
remain open during renovation.


One of Paris' first and most reputed luxury palaces, the Meurice
is known for its Art Nouveau glass roof and sweeping view of the
gardens by the Louvre museum.


Meurice chef Yannick Alleno this year won a prestigious third
star for its restaurant.


Starck's work ranges from interior designs to mass produced
consumer goods such as toothbrushes, chairs, and even houses.
