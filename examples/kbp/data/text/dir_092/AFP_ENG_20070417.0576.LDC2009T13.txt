Heavy weapons fire broke out Tuesday in the Somali capital
Mogadishu as Ethiopian army units and insurgents clashed in the
south of the city.


Machinegun and heavy mortar fire rattled the Al Kamin area of
south Mogadishu, and some shells exploded close to the
presidential palace, an AFP correspondent said.


There were no immediate reports of casualities.


The fighting is the latest in a series of skirmishes following a
truce announced by elders of Mogadishu's dominant Hawiye clan
after talks with Ethiopian military commanders. Ethiopian forces
have been deployed in the country since the beginning of the year
to boost the UN-backed transitional government.


The truce followed four days of intense fighting which erupted
March 29 when the Ethiopians launched a crackdown on suspected
insurgents accused of attacking government and Ethiopian army
positions in the capital.


Elders said at least 1,000 people were killed and more than 4,000
wounded.


The UN refugee agency said that at least 124,000 people had fled
Mogadishu in the past two months.
