Andrew Hall took 5-18 as South Africa bowled out England for just
154 in their crucial Super Eights clash on Tuesday and took a
huge step closer towards the World Cup semi-finals.


Hall said that criticism of the Proteas' lacklustre campaign had
spurred them on.


"The guys are very determined to play well for ourselves and our
country and especially after all of the negative reports about us
at home," said Hall who revelled in the conditions to dismiss
Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Nixon, Sajid Mahmood and
James Anderson in quick succession.


"It was a bouncy wicket, they were South African type conditions
with the ball reversing towards the end."


A win for South Africa on Tuesday will guarantee a semi-final
place.


Defending champions Australia, Sri Lanka and New Zealand have
already made sure of their last four spots.
