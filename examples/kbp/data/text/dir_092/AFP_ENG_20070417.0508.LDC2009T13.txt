Shoaib Malik looks set to be become the next captain of Pakistan,
according to reports on Tuesday.


Shoaib has emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Inzamam-
ul-Haq who decided to step down after Pakistan's first round
World Cup exit.


The respected www.cricinfo.com website said the Pakistan Cricket
Board (PCB) will announce the decision by the end of this week.


The appointment is likely to be until September, when the
situation will be reviewed again ahead of an international season
that includes a full series in India and a home series against
Australia.


Shoaib emerged the favourite after Younis Khan, the current vice-
captain, turned down the job.


"In principle, a decision has been taken to offer it to Malik.
There isn't really another suitable candidate around," one
official told the website.
