Islamic fundamentalists stormed a police station Tueseday and
killed 12 police officers in the northern Nigerian city of Kano,
police said.


An officer at the scene told AFP the group, including men and
women, attacked the suburban police post in broad daylight,
killing the station chief, his wife and 11 officers.


Official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) also reported that 12
policemen and a civilian were killed in the incident.


A spokesman for the federal police in Abuja, Haz Iwendi, could
only confirm 10 policemen dead and described the attackers as
"fundamentalists".


"It is the handiwork of Muslim fundamentalists. We want to flush
them out from where they are presently holed up, arrest them and
bring them to justice," said Iwendi by telephone.


The assailants briefly occupied the station and were surrounded,
but escaped into a nearby abandoned waterworks building,
witnesses said.


A combined team of soldiers and policemen has closed all roads
leading to the town, preventing people from reaching the area,
NAN said.


The bodies of the 13 people killed were taken to the morgue,
police spokesman Baba Mohamed said.


Last Friday armed men gunned down a radical Muslim cleric and two
of his followers in a mosque in a Kano suburb.


Religious unrest in northern Nigeria's most populous city has
claimed thousands of lives in the past 25 years.
