Yahoo reported on Tuesday that its profits sagged 11 percent
under the weight of operating expenses despite the promising
launch of its overhauled Panama advertising platform.


The stock price of the Sunnyvale, California-based Internet
search engine company dropped more than seven percent to 29.79
dollars in after-hours trading following the release of the
earnings figures.


Yahoo's net income for the first quarter of 2007 was 142 million
dollars, or 10 cents per share, as compared with 160 million, or
11 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.


Revenues minus money Yahoo pays partners was 1.18 billion dollars
in the first quarter of 2007, a nine percent increase from the
1.09 billion in revenues reported in the quarter last year.


Yahoo credited the launch of its overhauled Panama advertising
program near the end of the quarter with boosting ad sales.


Yahoo's operating income for the first quarter of the year was
169 million, a 16 percent drop from the 201 million dollars it
brought in during the first three months of 2006.


"We continued to make good progress against the goals we outlined
for the company last year and as a result, delivered a solid
financial performance for the first quarter," said Yahoo chief
executive Terry Semel.


"We believe that Yahoo! is well positioned to capture the major
growth opportunities we see ahead for the future."
