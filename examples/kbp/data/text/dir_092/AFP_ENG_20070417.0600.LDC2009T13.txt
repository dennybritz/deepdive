Virginia Tech Univerity canceled its marquee annual American
football Spring Game, set for the weekend, officials said Tuesday
in the wake of a campus massacre.


The deadliest school shooting in US history has halted most, but
not all, sport events, most notably Saturday's Spring Game.


Virginia Tech's American football squad has been among the
nation's elite teams at times, playing for the US college
championship in 2000.


The school also canceled a home baseball game planned for
Wednesday and a softball game that had been scheduled Tuesday.


Home sports events scheduled for next weekend will be played,
school officials said, including baseball games Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, softball games on Saturday and Sunday and a lacrosse
match on Saturday.


Virginia Tech students will also compete as planned in Atlantic
Coast Conference championship meets in tennis, golf and
athletics.
