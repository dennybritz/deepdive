Diego Maradona has recovered enough from a relapse of hepatitis
to possibly allow him to continue his treatment for alcohol abuse
at home, doctors for the football great said Tuesday.


"Mr Diego Maradona continues to improve after his stay in the
clinic, with laboratory work showing clear improvement," said a
statement released by the private Los Arcos clinic a day after it
issued a note warning of abnormalities in his liver functions.


"If he continues to improve, the patient will be in shape to
check out and to continue his treatment with his personal
physician," said the statement.


Maradona, 46, was rushed to Los Arcos in Buenos Aires on Friday
complaining of severe abdominal pain, just two days after being
discharged from a different clinic after nearly two weeks'
treatment for excessive drinking.


Alfredo Cahe, Maradona's personal physician, said on Monday that
Maradona was not doing well, but was not in in serious condition.


The former captain of Argentina's winning World Cup football team
and one of the sport's all-time greats has spent 18 days in
hospital.


The ex-star player for Barcelona and Naples has seen his career
on and off the football pitch marred by repeated drug and alcohol
abuse.


Maradona has suffered from hepatitis B since 1991, when he played
for Barcelona.


He was hospitalized in 2000 and 2004 for heart attacks provoked
by cocaine overdoses.
