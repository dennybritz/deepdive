Telecom Italia has named Pasquale Pistorio, the former head of
French-Italian semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics, as its new
chairman, Italian news agencies reported Tuesday.


The reports, citing Gilberto Benetton, who sits on the Telecom
Italia board, said Pistorio would replace Guido Rossi, who
resigned earlier this month under pressure from leading
shareholder Pirelli.


Pistorio is to become the third chairman of the group since
September 2006.


Marco Tronchetti Provera, the current chairman of Pirelli, had
previously been chairman of Telecom Italia but resigned last
September after a disagreement over strategy with the Italian
government.


Pirelli, which owns an 18-percent stake in Telecom Italia, had
been in talks with US telecom group AT&T and its Mexican
affiliate about selling two- thirds of this stake, which is held
by holding company Olimpia.


AT&T pulled out of talks on Monday because of differences
over control of the group, Italy's biggest telecoms company.
