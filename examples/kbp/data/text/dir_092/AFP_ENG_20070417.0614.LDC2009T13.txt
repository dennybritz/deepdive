The South Korean student who went on a murderous rampage through
a US university was known for writing gory, morbid plays that
belied his silent presence in class, the campus newspaper
reported Tuesday.


"His writing, the plays, were really morbid and grotesque,"
student Stephanie Derry told the Collegiate Times of the dramas
written by Cho Seung-Hui.


"I remember one of them very well. It was about a son who hated
his stepfather. In the play the boy threw a chain saw around, and
hammers at him. But the play ended with the boy violently
suffocating the father with a rice krispy treat," Derry said.


"He even wrote one play about students being stalked by a
teacher," she said.


Derry told the paper that other students used to joke about Cho's
creepy work.


"I mean who throws hammers or chainsaws around?," she said. "But
we always joked we were just waiting for him to do something,
waiting to hear about something he did," Derry said.


"But when I got the call it was Cho who had done this, I started
crying, bawling."


Derry noted that Cho had always been silent in class, not
reacting to students' comments on his work.


"He would just sit and watch us, but wouldn't say anything. It
was his lack of behavior that really set him apart. He basically
just kept to himself, very isolated," Derry said.
