Russian nuclear contractor Atomstroiexport cannot complete work
on Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant this year due to a cash
crunch and technical problems, a senior Russian official said
Tuesday.


"It is clear that we have to extend the deadline. How long, we do
not know. It is being studied by experts," said Igor Ivanov,
secretary of Russia's security council.


The completion of the power station by Atomstroiexport and the
delivery of nuclear fuel by Russia, planned for this year, were
delayed by what Moscow had earlier described as financial
problems.


Russia had accused Iran of not paying the amounts agreed upon in
a deal reached last September on the construction and nuclear
fuel supply to the plant, but at the end of March, Moscow
acknowledged that Tehran had resumed its payments.


Under the September deal, Russia was to deliver nuclear fuel to
Iran in March, the power station would begin working in September
and it would start producing energy in November.
