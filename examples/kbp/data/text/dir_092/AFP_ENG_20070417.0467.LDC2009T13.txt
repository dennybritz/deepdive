Some 20 people have been arrested in relation to last week's
suicide bombings in the Moroccan port city of Casablanca, a
police source said Tuesday.


One of those in custody was a woman related to two suspects on
the run.


"She is the sister of a wanted suicide bomber and the wife of a
certain Younes, who is also on the run," said the source.


Hasna Moussaid rented the apartment in the Hay al Farah district
where four suicide bombers were cornered by police last Tuesday.


Three blew themselves up and police shot dead the fourth before
he could detonate his explosives.


Police now believe that Ayoub Raydi, the second bomber who blew
himself up killing a police officer, was the coordinator between
the different cells of the group.


His brother Abdelfettah Raydi died when he blew himself up in an
Internet cafe on March 11, wounding his suspected accomplice
Youssef Khoudri, and three other people.


It was the police investigation into that attack that led to last
week's raids.


On Saturday two brothers blew themselves up near to the US
consulate in Casablanca and an American language school.
