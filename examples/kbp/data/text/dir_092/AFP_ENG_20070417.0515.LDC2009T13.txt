About 140 children and teachers were hospitalised in southwest
China after a fertilizer plant discharged a "huge amount" of
sulfur dioxide, state media reported late Tuesday.


The incident took place early Monday in Guizhou province, the
Xinhua news agency reported, quoting a local official.


The colorless gas, which can cause respiratory problems, remained
in the air due to heavy fog in the area, the report said.


Five teachers and some 135 students from two primary schools and
a middle school complained they were having trouble breathing and
were hospitalised, according to Huang Yonghui, executive deputy
head of Xifeng county in Guizhou.


Six children were in "serious but not critical condition," Huang
said, adding that some of those affected were still being
treated. He declined to say how many people were still in
hospital.


Local authorities have launched an investigation into the
incident, Xinhua said.
