Dutch bank ABN Amro said Tuesday it had extended its exclusive
takeover talks with British group Barclays until Friday, but
cautioned that a deal between the companies was not inevitable.


"ABN Amro and Barclays announced today that they have extended
the exclusivity period to the end of Friday 20 April 2007," a
statement on ABN Amro's website said.


The exclusivity of their talks had been set to expire at the end
of Tuesday.


"The discussions ... are progressing, but there can be no
certainty that they will lead to a transaction or the form it
will take," the statement added.
