Two extra-time goals from Sebastien Grax et Jerome Leroy ended
the dream run of fourth division Montceau in the French Cup here
on Tuesday.


The part-time outfit battled gamely for 90 minutes, holding their
first division opponents to a scoreless draw before finally
succumbing in additional time.


Sochaux did not take their opponents lightly but it took them
until the fifth minute of extra-time to get the goal their play
deserved.


Grax finished along the ground after a cross from the left by
Julien Quercia and the first division side, who currently sit
fourth in the table, ended the game on 112 minutes, Leroy
finishing off another cross from Quercia, this time from the
right.


Sochaux will now face either Marseille or Nantes, who clash in
the second semi- final on Wednesday, in the final as they attempt
to win the competition for the first time in 70 years.
