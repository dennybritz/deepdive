Italy's World Cup winning coach Marcello Lippi developped a
timely bout of amnesia as he spoke up for Italy's Euro 2012 bid
here on Tuesday.


"Last summer I remember becoming world champions in Germany but I
don't remember any other problems," said Lippi when questioned on
the match-fixing scandal that at one point seemed likely to
derail Italy's World Cup bid.


Lippi was less cantankerous when asked about the strength of
Italy's bid, though.


"I'm very hopeful about our bid because Italy can transmit its
passion for football, and our country, rich in its traditions, in
its capacity to welcome, is very enthusiastic about the idea of
organising the European Championships."


The decision for who will get the nod to host Euro 2012 will be
made here on Wednesday with two joint bids opposing the world
champions: Poland have teamed up with Ukraine while Hungery have
joined forces with Croatia.


Italy are regarded as the favourites despite recent hooligan
problems but the Polish-Ukraine bid can count on pole vault
legend Segei Bubka and Chelsea striker Andrei Shevchenko as
celebrated support.


The Hungary-Croatia bid is supported by the widow of Hungary's
greatest ever player Ferenc Puskas, as well as former Croatian
international Zvonimir Boban.
