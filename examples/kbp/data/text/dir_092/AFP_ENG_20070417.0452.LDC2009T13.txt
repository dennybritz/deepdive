Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was Tuesday fined 2,500 pounds by
the Football Association for an outburst at match officials
during his side's 2-2 draw with Portsmouth on December 16.


It is the second time this season that the Frenchman has been
fined for his touchline conduct and he may struggle to avoid a
ban from the dugout when a third charge is finally heard.


Wenger was sent to the stands for the second half of the
Premiership clash after angrily confronting both the fourth
official and referee Steve Bennett at half- time over the free-
kick which led to Portsmouth's opening goal in first-half
stoppage time.


That led to fresh disciplinary charges being imposed just days
after the Frenchman was fined 10,000 pounds for a touchline
confrontation with then-West Ham manager Alan Pardew in October
of last year.


Wenger is currently awaiting a date for a hearing on improper
conduct charges related to comments about a linesman in his
side's stormy League Cup defeat by Chelsea at the end of
February.


The Arsenal manager accused the linesman of lying by saying in
his match report that Emmanuel Adebayor, one of two Arsenal
players to be sent off, had hit Chelsea's Frank Lampard.


The FA subsequently revealed that the linesman had only reported
that Adebayor had been behaving in an aggressive fashion.
