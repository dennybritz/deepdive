Croatian police arrested Tuesday a former lawmaker wanted for war
crimes against Serb civilians during the country's independence
war, media reports said.


Branimir Glavas, still wearing the uniform of a retired general,
was escorted to prison in the eastern town of Osijek followed by
dozens of supporters.


He is the most senior political figure to have faced legal action
for war crimes in Croatia.


Croatian prosecutors indicted Glavas on Monday for ordering the
1991 abductions, torture and murder of 10 Serbs who were killed
by a special unit. Six others who were involved in those killings
were also indicted.


Glavas, 50, was the defence chief of Osijek at the time of the
atrocities, which were allegedly committed when the town was
surrounded by the Yugoslav army and rebel Serb forces.


At least 37 Serb civilians were killed in Osijek at the end of
1991 and the beginning of 1992, according to police figures.


Glavas had been released from custody in December after his
health deteriorated when he launched a hunger strike but
prosecutors are seeking to have him detained again ahead of a
trial.


Croatia's proclamation of independence from the former Yugoslavia
in 1991 sparked a four-year war with Belgrade-backed rebel Serbs
who opposed the move.
