Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki arrived in Syria on
Tuesday for talks with officials from the key regional ally ahead
of a conference on security in their shared neighbour Iraq.


Mottaki said he was in Damascus for bilateral talks and that it
was still too early to decide on whether Iran would take part in
next month's conference to be held in the Egyptian resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh, an AFP correspondent reported.


Mottaki was due to meet President Bashar al-Assad and his Syrian
counterpart Walid Muallem later Tuesday, Iranian sources in
Damascus said.


The conference will bring together the foreign ministers of
countries bordering Iraq and world powers, including the United
States.


It will follow last month's lower-level meeting in Baghdad, which
was initiated by Iraq's neighbours.


Earlier this month, Mottaki signalled reluctance to participate
in the Egypt conference, saying it should take place in Baghdad
and comprise only Iraq's neighbours.


He ruled out any meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice, whose country accuses Iran, along with Syria, of fuelling
the insurgency in Iraq.


Iranian officials have also said that their country is unlikely
to attend the conference as long as the US refuses to release
five Iranians arrested in Iraq in January.


Iran's apparent reluctance could be also linked to bumpy
relations with Egypt: Tehran severed bilateral diplomatic ties
with Cairo in 1979 over former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat's
decision to make peace with Israel.
