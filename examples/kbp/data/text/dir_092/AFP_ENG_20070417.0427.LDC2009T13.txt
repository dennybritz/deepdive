US President George W. Bush on Tuesday ordered US flags on
government buildings to fly at half-staff through Sunday in
mourning after the massacre at Virginia Tech, the White House
said.


Bush and First Lady Laura Bush were to travel to the university's
Blacksburg, Virginia, campus to take part in a memorial to the 32
victims of the deadliest school shooting in US history, said
spokeswoman Dana Perino.


"They are going to be there to express the sympathies, the
support and the prayers of the country. They will be there as the
national representatives on a day that is full of sorrow for
every American," Perino told reporters.
