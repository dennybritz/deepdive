Guinea-Bissau's new Prime Minister Martinho Ndafa Cabi announced
Tuesday an opposition-dominated government after being chosen to
lead the poor west African nation following a political crisis.


President Joao Bernardo Vieira, who named Cabi prime minister
after three weeks of political deadlock sparked by the no-
confidence vote against the regime of former premier Aristide
Gomes, holds key portfolios in the new government.


The new 29-member government is dominated by the Party for the
Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and the
Party for Social Change (PRS) which sparked the crisis that led
to the fall of Gomes.


Gomes got the boot for the manner in which state funds were spent
in one of the world's poorest countries and for failing to clear
pay arrears of civil servants.


Guinea-Bissau, which won independence from Portugal in 1974, is
the world's fifth poorest nation, according to the UN.
