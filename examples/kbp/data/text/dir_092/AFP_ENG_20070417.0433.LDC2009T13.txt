A leading Moroccan rights group called on the authorities on
Tuesday to respect human rights in their investigation of a
series of suicide bombings in Casablanca last week.


The head of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights, Abdelhamid
Amine, said: "Unfortunately in our country, terrorism
investigations are always accompanied by attacks on human
rights."


"We call on the authorities to respect these rights and we are
going to see if such attacks are less numerous this time," he
said, adding that his group was preparing a report on the current
investigations.


Six militants died last week as police searched for those behind
a March 11 explosion in a Casablanca Internet cafe.


Three men blew themselves up as they were pursued by police last
Tuesday and a fourth man died from police gunshot wounds.


On Saturday two brothers blew themselves up near the US consulate
in the port city and near an American language school there.


Later on Tuesday, a rally will be held in the centre of
Casablanca to condemn the suicide attacks.


Bringing together parties from across the political spectrum,
including islamist parties, it will be held under the banner
"Don't touch my country".


The attacks last week in Morocco and in neighbouring Algeria,
where 30 people died in three suicide attacks, have sparked fears
that the recent violence presages an upsurge in extremist
activity in the region.
