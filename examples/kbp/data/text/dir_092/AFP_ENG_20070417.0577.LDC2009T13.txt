Charges against a US Marine allegedly involved in the killing of
24 Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha have been dropped, the
military said in a statement on Tuesday.


Sergeant Sanick Dela Cruz, 24, had been charged with five counts
of unpremeditated murder but saw the accusations dismissed on
April 2, the Marines said in a statement released from their base
in Camp Pendleton, California.


The statement did not explain why the charges were dropped, and a
Marines spokesman refused to elaborate when contacted by AFP.


"We've said all we are going to say about it," he said.


Dela Cruz was one of four Marines charged last year with killing
civilians in Haditha, in the so-called Sunni triangle 260
kilometers (180 miles) west of Baghdad, in November 2005.


Prosecutors alleged the Marines went on a killing spree in the
town, shooting unarmed men, women and children after a comrade,
Miguel Terrazaz, was killed by a roadside bomb while on patrol.


Defense lawyers have said the Marines followed established
wartime rules of engagement and the deaths occurred after the
soldiers became embroiled in a furious firefight with insurgents.


Four other Marines -- including 3rd Battalion Commander Jeffrey
Chessani and Captain Lucas McConnell, neither of whom were in
Haditha during the bloodshed -- face charges of failing to
properly investigate or report the killings.
