South Africa captain Graeme Smith won his mini-battle with bitter
rival Kevin Pietersen here on Tuesday when he caught out the
England batsman in their crucial World Cup clash.


Smith took a running, diving catch to dismiss the South African-
born Pietersen off Andre Nel for just three off the second ball
of the 17th over to leave England reeling at 53-3.


Smith and Pietersen have been engaged in a bitter feud over the
last two years since Pietersen switched allegiances to England in
protest at the quota system in South Africa.
