England were 134-8 after 40 overs of their World Cup Super Eights
match against South Africa at the Kensington Oval here on
Tuesday.


Ravi Bopara was on 12 with Monty Panesar on one.


Ian Bell was the first man out caught by Ashwell Prince off Charl
Langeveldt for seven off 23 balls as England struggled early on.


Bell fell in the seventh over with the score on nine.


Skipper Michael Vaughan was the next man to go lbw to Andre Nel
for 17 in the 13th over with the total on 37.


South Africa then claimed the wicket they most desired when
skipper Graeme Smith caught his bitter rival Kevin Pietersen at
mid-off off Nel when the South African-born batsman had made just
three.


That left England on 53-3 in the 17th over.


Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood then put on 58 for the fourth
wicket before England suffered a dramatic collapse.


Smith took another catch to dismiss Strauss off Jacques Kallis
after the batsman had made 46.


Andrew Hall then took four quick wickets.


He got rid of Collingwood, lbw for 30, Andrew Flintoff, who was
bowled for five, Paul Nixon, caught behind by Mark Boucher and
Sajid Mahmood, clean bowled for nought as England slumped from
111-3 to 121-8 inside four overs.


Vaughan won the toss and elected to bat in a game they have to
win to keep alive their hopes of making the semi-finals.


A win for South Africa will guaranatee they will fill the final
last four place where they will join Australia, New Zealand and
Sri Lanka.


South Africa made two changes from the team which lost to New
Zealand in their previous game, bringing in Justin Kemp in place
of spinner Robin Peterson and Charl Langeveldt replacing Mahkaya
Ntini


England retained the side which beat Bangladesh in the last
match.
