A Texas university was evacauted Tuesday after a "non-specific"
bomb threat, St. Edward's University said on its website.


Day classes were cancelled after the bomb threat and "students
who are on campus are evacuated to the soccer and softball fields
immediately until further notice," the Austin, Texas university
said.


The bomb threat comes a day after a 23-year-old South Korean
student described as a "loner" carried out the deadliest school
shooting in US history, killing at least 30 people at Virginia
Tech University.
