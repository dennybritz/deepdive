Czech electricity giant CEZ announced Tuesday it had signed an
agreement to form a power and mining joint venture in Republika
Srpska in which it would invest up to 1.4 billion euros (1.89
billion dollars).


"This will be the biggest foreign investment in Bosnia and
Herzegovina," the company added.


Under the agreement signed with the Republika Srpska energy
company ERS and state-owned mining company and power company
Rudnik i Termoelektrana Gacko, CEZ will have a 51.0-stake in the
new joint venture company.


The joint venture will build a 600-700 MW power station, develop
current coal mining around the north-eastern town of Gacko and
revamp an existing 300 MW power plant, it added.


"CEZ will bring the financing to the venture with the other
parties bringing their existing power and mining assets," CEZ
spokesman Ladislav Kriz told AFP.


Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of the Bosnian Serb dominated
Republika Srpska and the Muslim and Croat-dominated Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was created after the bloody wars
following the break up of former Yugoslavia.
