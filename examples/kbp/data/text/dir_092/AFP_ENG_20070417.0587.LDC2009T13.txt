Italian insurance company Generali said on Tuesday it had
received the green light from the Chinese authorities to launch a
joint venture with the biggest Chinese oil producer China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).


The venture will be the first to operate in the damage insurance
sector with mixed Chinese and foreign capital, Generali said in a
statement.


It will start out in the capital Beijing, before developing in
the Chinese regions, insuring private individuals and commercial
risks, it said.


The market for damage insurance in China is in the hands of 38
groups, of which 13 are foreign, and the volume of premiums
increased by 22.6 percent in 2006, Generali said.


Generali and CNPC are already shareholers in Generali China Life
Insurance Company, the second biggest life insurance company in
China.
