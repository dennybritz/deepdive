President George W. Bush joined thousands of grieving Virginia
Tech students and staff Tuesday at a memorial service to mourn 32
people killed in the deadliest US school shooting ever.


Teary-eyed students hugged each other as they filed into the
Cassell Coliseum, many wearing the school's orange and maroon
colors amid tight police and secret service security.


The Virginia Tech corps of cadets marched into the coliseum
solemnly to a muffled funeral drum beat, while Bush and his wife
Laura arrived later for the convocation.


"I'm here to show my support for the victims and to stand
together," said graduate student Kerri Symons, 21.


Earlier, police identified Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old student
majoring in English, as the gunman behind the shooting at the
university in Blacksburg, Virginia.


He killed 30 people in a classroom building before turning the
gun on himself, police said, adding that they suspect he had also
killed two other people moments earlier in another campus
building.
