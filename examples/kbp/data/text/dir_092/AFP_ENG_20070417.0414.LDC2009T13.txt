Light winds forced the cancellation of the Louis Vuitton Cup for
the second day running here on Tuesday.


Organisers had been hopeful conditions would improve after
Monday's opening blank, but to no avail.


The projected start time of 1420 (1220GMT) for the second day of
round robin matches was delayed with the race committee deciding
to call it a day at 1630 (1430GMT).


"Racing on both courses has been cancelled," a spokeswoman for
the organisers confirmed.


With Monday's programme moved to Friday's first reserve day
Tuesday's 10-race menu has been rescheduled for the second
reserve day next Monday.


The winner of the two-month long Louis Vuitton will go on to
challenge Swiss defender Alinghi in June's America's Cup.
