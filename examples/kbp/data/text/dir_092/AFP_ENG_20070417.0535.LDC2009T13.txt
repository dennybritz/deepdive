UN chief Ban Ki-moon expressed distress Tuesday over the deaths
of five UN workers in a bomb attack on their convoy in
Afghanistan as well over mounting civilian casualties in the
country.


"The secretary general was deeply distressed to learn of the
fatal incident which occurred earlier this morning, when a UN
convoy was hit by a remote- controlled explosive in Kandahar
city, resulting in the death" of five UN workers, his spokeswoman
Michele Montas said in a statement.


Four Nepalese security guards and an Afghan driver were killed in
the bombing, in one of the deadliest attacks on the world body in
Afghanistan since 2001.


Ban also expressed sadness over an explosion which killed at
least four children and wounded four others at a school in the
western Afghan city of Herat.


Montas said the UN chief "strongly condemns such despicable acts
of violence against civilians."


The attack which killed an Afghan driver and four Nepalese
contractors working with the United Nations office for project
services in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar was claimed by
the ousted Taliban.


The UN, which oversees reconstruction in post-conflict
Afghanistan, said the attack was "a clear violation of
international humanitarian law and the UN will be pursuing full
accountability for those who are behind this."
