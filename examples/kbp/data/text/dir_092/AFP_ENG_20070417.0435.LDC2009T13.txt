German energy giant E.ON will purchase land in Finland where it
plans to build a nuclear plant, the STT news agency reported on
Tuesday.


The small town of Loviisa, 85 kilometres (53 miles) east of
Helsinki, is preparing to sell 112 hectares (277 acres) of land
near a site where two of Finland's four existing nuclear reactors
are located, according to a municipal official.


E.ON said last October that it wanted to participate in
developing Finland's expansion of its nuclear facilities, and
said it would be involved in the construction of the Nordic
country's sixth reactor.


A fifth reactor called the Olkiluoto 3, the world's first
pressurised water reactor, is currently being built in
southwestern Finland.


Finnish electricity companies Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima
(TVO), which owns the Olkiluoto 3, meanwhile beat E.ON to the
punch with an announcement last month that they would launch an
environmental impact assessment report aimed at clearing the way
for a sixth reactor.


The potential construction of Finland's sixth reactor is not
likely to happen for many years due to political controversy and
legal delays.


The building of the Olkiluoto 3 is already running a year and a
half behind schedule and is not expected to be operational until
the beginning of 2011.
