US President George W. Bush on Tuesday ordered US flags on
government buildings to fly at half-staff through Sunday in
mourning after the massacre at Virginia Tech.


"Our nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones at
Virginia Tech.  We hold the victims in our hearts. We lift them
up in our prayers, and we ask a loving God to comfort those who
are suffering," he said in his proclamation.


Bush and First Lady Laura Bush were to travel to the university's
Blacksburg, Virginia, campus for a memorial to the 32 victims of
the deadliest school shooting in US history, said White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino.


"They are going to be there to express the sympathies, the
support and the prayers of the country. They will be there as the
national representatives on a day that is full of sorrow for
every American," Perino told reporters.
