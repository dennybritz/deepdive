Eighteen gold miners have been confirmed dead and another 30 are
still trapped one day after an illegal mine collapsed in western
Ghana, police said Tuesday.


Attempts to rescue the 30 men still trapped in an abandoned
mineshaft at Nsuapim, some 400 kilometres (250 miles) west of the
capital Accra, are being hampered by a lack of earth-moving
equipment, they said.


Area police commander Daniel Sampana said he had sought help from
one of the big mining companies in the area, Bogoso Gold Limited,
which had offered excavators. Bogoso is a subsidiary of Canada's
Golden Star Resources Limited.


Illegal gold mining has been a source of concern for both the
Ghanaian government and the big mining companies.


Illegal miners often take over abandoned mineshafts and galleries
in order to dig for gold there on a small scale. Left without
maintenance for years these structures sometimes cave in on the
miners.
