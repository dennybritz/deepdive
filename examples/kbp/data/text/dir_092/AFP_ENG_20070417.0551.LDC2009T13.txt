Two Lebanese students were among the 32 people killed by a gunman
at Virginia Tech University in the United States, government
sources told AFP on Tuesday.


The Lebanese foreign ministry was officially informed that Reema
Samaha and Ross Abdallah Alameddine, both 19, were killed in
Monday's rampage at the university, they said.


Police identified the gunman behind the deadliest school shooting
in US history as an English major "loner" student from South
Korea. The man shot dead 32 students and staff at the campus
before turning the gun on himself.
