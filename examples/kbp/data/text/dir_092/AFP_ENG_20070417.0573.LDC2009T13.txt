The mayor of the southern Japanese city of Nagasaki, Iccho Ito,
died early Wednesday in hospital after being shot as he
campaigned for re-election, Kyodo news agency reported.


Ito, 61, was shot late Tuesday as he got out of a van at his
election office facing Nagasaki's central train station.


Police said the shooter, identified as Tetsuya Shiroo, was
affiliated with Japan's largest crime syndicate, the Yamaguchi-
gumi.
