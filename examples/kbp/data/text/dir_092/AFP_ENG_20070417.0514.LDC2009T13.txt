A South Korean student railed against "rich kids," "debauchery"
and "deceitful charlatans" in a note he left behind before
carrying out the deadliest school shooting in US history, US
media reported Tuesday.


The 23-year-old student wrote: "You caused me to do this," in a
several-page- long note that he left in his dorm room, ABC News
reported.


The note began in the present tense and then shifted to the past
tense as Cho Seung-Hui explained his actions amid a rambling list
of grievances cited by the Chicago Tribune.


Cho wrote the note in his door room after he killed two people in
another dorm room Monday morning, ABC reported.


He then re-armed and went to a classroom building on the other
side of campus where he killed 30 more people before shooting
himself in the head, sources told ABC.


Cho had also shown recent signs of "violent, aberrant behavior,"
including stalking women and setting a fire in a dorm room,
investigators in Virginia told the Chicago Tribune.


Authorities found a receipt for a Glock 9 millimeter handgun,
bought on March 13, in Cho's backpack which also contained two
knives and a cache of bullets, ABC reported.


He bought his second weapon, a .22 caliber pistol, within the
last week, ABC reported.
