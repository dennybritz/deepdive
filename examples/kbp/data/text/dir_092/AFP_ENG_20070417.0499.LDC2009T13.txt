Iranian secret services have been trying to recruit Israelis of
Iranian origin to spy on the Jewish state, the Israeli domestic
security service Shin Beth said on Tuesday.


Iranian agents posing as consulate workers have on at least 10
occasions approached Israelis applying for authorisation to visit
their relatives in Iran at Tehran's consulate in Istanbul, it
said in a statement.


The Haaretz daily said that the Shin Beth had detained one
Israeli of Iranian decent upon his return from Iran and the man
had admitted being recruited and accepting money to cover his
costs.


The man said he had been asked to lure a relative who used to
work for the Israeli security services to Istanbul, the paper
said. It did not say when the man had been detained or whether he
remained in detention.


Israel considers Iran as its arch-enemy, pointing to repeated
calls by its President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to wipe the Jewish
state off the map.


Israelis of Iranian origin often travel to Istanbul to obtain
Iranian passports in order to visit relatives in the Islamic
republic, which does not have official relations with the Jewish
state.
