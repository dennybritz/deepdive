A steel cable around one of the reactors at a controversial Czech
nuclear power plant fingered by critics as a safety risk was
found ruptured during a routine check on Tuesday, operator CEZ
announced.


The flaw at one of the two reactors at the Soviet-designed
Temelin plant is likely to fuel fresh protests over its safety.


CEZ said in a statement that the ruptured steel cord did not
represent a hazard and that the reactor would have to be closed
for repairs only if another one of the 36 cables was broken.


One of the reactors is currently not operational after a section
was found to have high humidity levels at the start of this week.


In March, two leakages of mildly radioactive water fuelled
concerns about the plant's safety. Much of the criticism comes
from neighbouring Austria.


Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek and Austrian Chancellor
Alfred Grusenbauer last month agreed to to set up an inter-
parliamentary commission to try and sort out their long drawn
spat over the plant.


Austrian anti-nuclear protesters have staged a series of cross-
border protests. Temelin is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from
the Czech-Austrian border.


In March, the head of the Czech Republic's nuclear power watchdog
said the frequency of leaks at the Temelin plant was
"unacceptable" after the leak of about 1,000 litres of mildly
radioactive water.


Austria banned the use of nuclear energy in its constitution
after a referendum in 1978.
