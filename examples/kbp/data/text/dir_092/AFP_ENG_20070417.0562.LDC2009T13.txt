The widow of a British lord whose decomposing body was found in
the hills on the French Riviera in 2005 will stand trial next
month accused of paying her brother for a contract killing,
judicial sources said Tuesday.


Jamila M'Barek, 38, will appear before the court in Nice on March
22-25, accused of accessory to murder, alongside her brother,
Mohammed M'Barek, 41, who is accused of murdering Anthony Ashley-
Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury.


Prosecutors claim that M'Barek had feared an impending divorce
would threaten her rich lifestyle as well as property inheritance
rights and had therefore persuaded her elder brother Mohammed to
strangle her husband.


Mohamed M'Barek -- who was extradited from Germany in 2005 --
initially denied involvement, but later told police he
accidentally strangled the lord during an argument. Both are in
custody in southern France.


The body of the 66-year-old Cooper was found in April 2005, five
months after he vanished from his home in Cannes.


Educated at Eton and Oxford and a fluent French speaker, the lord
inherited his title from his grandfather when he was 22 years
old, along with the family seat at Wimborne, southwest England,
and its 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) estate.


He divided his time between Britain and the French Riviera where
he led a colourful and largely nocturnal existence. At the time
of his death he was known to be in a liaison with another young
woman.
