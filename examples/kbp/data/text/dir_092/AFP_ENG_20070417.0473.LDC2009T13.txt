The acting boss of one of the so-called "Five Families" that
control Mafia activity in New York was jailed Tuesday for 18
months on racketeering charges, justice officials said.


Genovese family capo Matthew "Matty the Horse" Ianniello, was
convicted of collecting unlawful labor payments from union
officials and obstructing a grand jury investigation into the
union.


Ianniello pleaded guilty to the charges in September. Prosecutors
said that a union official identified as Salvatore "Hotdogs"
Battaglia regularly received illegal payments from local bus
companies in return for favorable treatment.


Ianniello was involved with collecting the payments, they said.


Ianniello was also ordered to pay a 25,000 dollar fine and to
forfeit 75,000 dollars he received in illegal payments.
