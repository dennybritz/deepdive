Democrats in Congress said Tuesday they plan to have an emergency
Iraq spending bill on President George W. Bush's desk next week,
setting up a likely showdown over a threatened presidential veto.


"We want to try to get it (to the president) next week," Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters, one day before
Democrats were due to meet with the US president.


Democratic leaders were to sit down with Bush Wednesday in hopes
of averting a clash over legislation linking the 120-billion-
dollar-plus spending bills approved in both houses of Congress to
a timeline for withdrawing US troops.


The US House and Senate last month passed slightly differing
versions of legislation that would require most US combat troops
to withdraw from Iraq over the course of 2008.


The Pentagon has said it is just weeks away from running out of
money to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but
the White House vows to veto any bill imposing time constraints
on military planners in Iraq.


Bush and his supporters assert that a timetable for pulling US
troops would be tantamount to conceding defeat to terrorists.


Reid, who this week called Bush's war policy "wrongheaded," said
he hadn't decided what he'll say at Wednesday's meeting with the
president, but will press for a "change of policy" in Iraq.


Neither side has shown an inclination to budge, but talking is a
hopeful start, the Democratic leader said.


"He's going to be sitting right next to me," said Reid. "Unless
he plugs his ears, he's going to have to listen."
