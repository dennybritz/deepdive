Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said on Tuesday that a panel of
experts would examine the cases of the thousands of detainees
held in US and Iraqi jails and free those with no charges to
answer.


In a statement released after a cabinet meeting in Baghdad,
Maliki said: "A committee specialised in reviewing detainees'
affairs in the prisons run by Iraqi authorities and multinational
forces had been formed.


"The judiciary will set free all those who haven't been charged
while those charged would be sent before the judiciary," he said.


In the four years since a US invasion overthrew dictator Saddam
Hussein, thousands of suspected criminals and insurgents have
been rounded up, while Iraq's judicial system has failed to keep
up with the case load.


And, in some cases, "security detainees" are held without trial
in a process which has been condemned by human rights groups.
Iraqi interior ministry forces have also been accused of
maintaining secret prisons.


Last year, the Iraqi ministry of human rights estimated that
there were 28,000 prisoners in Iraq, just over half of them in US
military custody.
