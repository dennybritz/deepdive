South Korea said Thursday it would resume humanitarian aid for
North Korean flood victims next week, in another sign of warming
relations since the North pledged to scrap its nuclear weapons.


Vice Unification Minister Shin Eon-Sang said the shipment of
flood aid, suspended after the North's missile launches last
July, would begin on March 28.


"We will start shipping blankets from March 28, followed by the
shipment of rice, trucks, cement and iron bars between April and
May," he told reporters.
