Thirteen more people have died in landslides and accidents caused
by heavy rain in Pakistan, officials and residents said Thursday,
bringing the death toll from several days of bad weather to 80.


Six members of a family died and two were injured when they were
hit by an avalanche in the mountainous Dir district of North West
Frontier Province on Wednesday, local residents told AFP by
telephone.


Separately the roof of a religious seminary at Karak town in the
same province collapsed on Wednesday, killing two female students
and injuring another eight, local police official Khurshid
Bungash said.


Another three people were reported killed in roof collapses in
other towns in the hilly province bordering Afghanistan during
the last 24 hours, officials said.


Further mudslides were reported in Pakistani Kashmir, where 37
survivors of the devastating 2005 earthquake, mostly women, were
killed in two separate landslips on Tuesday.


Two more women were killed on Wednesday when a landslide swept
away a house at Moyian Saydan village in Kashmir's Jhelum valley,
police said.


The 7.6-magnitude earthquake in October 2005 killed more than
73,000 people and left 3.3 million homeless. More than 1,000
people also died in Indian Kashmir.


Local authorities evacuated dozens of Kashmiris whose homes were
damaged by the rain to safer areas in the Himalayan region, where
thousands of people are still living in tents after the
earthquake.
