Hong Kong ports-to-telecoms giant Hutchison Whampoa Thursday
reported a 40 percent rise in 2006 net profit, helped by an
improved performance at its loss- making 3G mobile operations.


The company, controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, reported a net
profit of 20.03 billion dollars for 2006, up from 14.34 billion
dollars and just shy of analysts estimate of 20.28 billion
dollars.


The group's revenue grew 11 percent to 267 billion dollars.


The company's third-generation operation, the 3 Group, reported
narrowing losses due to the continued growth in its customer base
and revenue, with total revenue up 35 percent to 50.7 billion
dollars and losses cut by 45 percent to just under 20 billion
dollars.


Property giant Cheung Kong (Holdings), which holds 49.9 percent
of Hutchison Whampoa, posted a net profit of 18.08 billion
dollars compared with 13.995 billion dollars and also was shy of
analyst forecasts of 18.3 billion dollars.


It reported sales of 15.35 billion dollars, up from 14.36 billion
dollars in 2005.
