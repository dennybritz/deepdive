Japan's trade surplus gained 7.7 percent in February from a year
earlier to 979.6 billion yen (8.3 billion dollars) on strong
exports of cars and steel products, the government said Thursday.


The gain, which came after the government's downward revision of
January's figure to a deficit of 1.9 billion yen, was well ahead
of market expectations, as analysts had predicted a trade surplus
of 630.8 billion yen on average.


Exports last month rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to 6.418
trillion yen, while imports increased 10.1 percent to 5.438
trillion yen, the finance ministry said in a preliminary report.


"Among exports, automobiles and steel products expanded in
February," the ministry said in a statement. Auto exports jumped
19.7 percent while steel products rose 28.5 percent.


Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose 9.2 percent to
806.8 billion yen, the first increase in two months, the ministry
said.


Its trade surplus with Asia plunged 38.0 percent to 464.4 billion
yen, the first decline in four months. Its trade deficit with
China surged from 13.8 billion yen to 308.1 billion yen, the
first expansion in four months.


Japan's trade surplus with the European Union jumped 33.3 percent
to 446.3 billion yen, the 16th straight year-on-year increase.


These surpluses set off the huge deficit Japan has with the
Middle East due to massive oil imports.
