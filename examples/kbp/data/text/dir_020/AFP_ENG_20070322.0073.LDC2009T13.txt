Officials from 20 countries will meet in Auckland next week as
part of the global battle to prevent the trafficking of weapons
of mass destruction, New Zealand Defence Minister Phil Goff said
Thursday.


The meeting, from March 26-28, is being held under the
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), which the US began in
2003.


"The PSI provides a clear deterrent to weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) movements, and a means of preventing or
stopping those movements if deterrence alone is not enough," Goff
said.


The aim of the PSI is to stop terrorists and rogue states getting
hold of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.


A total of 80 countries participate in the PSI. Twenty nations
will attend the meeting in Auckland, including the US, Britain,
Australia and Japan.
