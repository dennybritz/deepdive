LeBron James scored 17 of his 31 points in the final period, but
Dirk Nowitzki led four Dallas players in double figures as the
Mavericks downed Cleveland 98-90 on Wednesday.


Nowitzki scored 23 points, Jason Terry scored 21, Devin Harris
added 17 and Eric Dampier 13 for the Mavericks, who have won four
straight games since a rare two- game skid.


The playoff-bound Mavericks improved to 56-11 and are now five
games in front of idle Phoenix for the top spot in the Western
Conference and the NBA's best record.


After Harris banked in a 3-pointer to make it 79-66 entering the
fourth quarter, James single-handedly brought the Cavaliers back.


The superstar forward scored each point in an 11-4 run to make it
83-77 with 7:08 left.


But the Mavericks then went on an 8-3 run to take control, capped
by Nowitzki's fadeaway jumper to make it 91-80 with four minutes
remaining.


Nowitzki was just 9-of-24 from the field, but Terry and Harris
combined to shoot 16-of-27, including 3-of-6 from the arc.


Drew Gooden had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Cavaliers,
who have lost two straight after a season-high eight-game winning
streak.
