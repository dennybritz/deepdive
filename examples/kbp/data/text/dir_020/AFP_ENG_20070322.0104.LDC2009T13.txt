British Swimming plans to pre-select any of their swimmers who
finish in the top four of their events at the Melbourne world
championships for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.


National performance director Bill Sweetenham wants pre-selection
to be sanctioned by the British Olympic Association, so the
British swimmers see it as a bonus in their attempt to take on
the world's best here next week.


"We're using these world championships, provided we get the
sanction from the British Olympic Association, to pre-select any
swimmer who ranks in the top four in this meet in an Olympic
event to be approved for the Olympic team next year," Sweetenham
told a press conference Thursday.


"By doing that we will focus our best athletes on an August
preparation for next year rather than the March (Olympic) trials.


"The European championships are in March next year in Eindhoven
and they are just before our Olympic trials so that anyone who is
pre-selected will go to swim in the European championships and
then we have the world short-course championships to finish off
our preparations."


Sweetenham said British swimming has turned around and resources
were now able to be spent on what he termed positive aspects of
the swim program.


"We see the world championships as a start of our preparations
for the Olympics next year and hopefully we can uncover some
talent that can stand up under international pressure in terms of
preparing for the 2012 London Olympics," he said.
