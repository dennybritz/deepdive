The South Korean government said Thursday it will build a park in
memory of scores of civilians killed by US soldiers in the early
months of the 1950-53 Korean War.


The government has allocated 19.1 billion won (20.3 million
dollars) for the park at the scene of the tragedy. Work is
scheduled to begin in October and finish by the end of 2009,
Yonhap news agency quoted officials as saying.


The war began in June 1950 with a North Korean invasion which
quickly pushed back US and South Korean forces. In July that
year, US soldiers shot dead scores of Korean refugees in the
village of Nogun-ri, 230 kilometres (144 miles) south of Seoul.


The South Korean government concluded that 150 were killed, with
55 wounded and 13 missing, Yonhap said. Thirty of the victims are
still alive and claiming that as many as 400 died.


A US Army report in 1999 said it could not determine the number
of dead or injured. It attributed the tragedy to the combat
inexperience of retreating US forces, who were fearful of
attempts by North Korean soldiers to mingle with refugees.
