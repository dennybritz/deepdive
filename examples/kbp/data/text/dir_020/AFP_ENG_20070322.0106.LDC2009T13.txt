The Dutch banking and insurance group ING has approached two
investment banks to help it form a banking alliance in Belgium,
The Netherlands and Luxembourg, a newspaper reported on Thursday.


The newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad quoted unnamed financial
sources as saying that the bank had been studying such a change
in its strategy for some months.


The process had been accelerated by news that Dutch bank ABN Amro
and Barclays of Britain were considering an alliance.


"This means that the chances of creating a Dutch champion are now
minimal," the newspaper commented.


ING declined to comment on the report.


The newspaper identified potential partners as French-Belgian
bank Dexia, Dutch- Belgian group Fortis and Belgian bank KBC.


ING was capitalised at 70 billion euros (93 billion dollars) and
was big enough to mount a takeover for one of them. The
investment banks involved were Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, the
report said.
