A daytime curfew was slapped on a part of southern Nepal on
Thursday after at least 26 people were killed and dozens injured
in brutal clashes between an ethnic group and Maoists, officials
said.


"We have asked for more police officers from the neighbouring
district, and they will arrive this afternoon," said Ram Kumar
Khanal, police superintendent of Rautahat district about 90
kilometres (57 miles) south of Kathmandu.


"The situation is now under control," he said, adding locals were
banned from venturing outside their homes from the morning until
mid-afternoon to prevent a repeat of what local media have
described as a "bloodbath".


The violence occurred in the town of Gaur, close to the border
with India and dominated by the Mahadhesi ethnic group whose
activists have been staging a series of violent protests and
strikes in recent weeks.


The ethnic group has been pushing for greater representation in
national politics in the wake of a peace deal between the Maoists
and central government that was signed four months ago.
