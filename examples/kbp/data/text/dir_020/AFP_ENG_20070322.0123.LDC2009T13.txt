The price of shares in French civil engineering group Eiffage
shot up 13.13 percent in early trading here on Thursday on
rumoured interest from Spanish construction group Sacyr, market
sources said.


Eiffage shares were being quoted at 96.39 euros in an overall
market showing a gain of 1.24 percent as measured by the CAC 40
index.


A French broker commented: "There is a rumour that Sacyr is
increasing its stake in Eiffage. The suggestion being that Sacyr
would sell part of its holding in Repsol to increase its stake in
Eiffage.


"The volume of trading (in Eiffage shares) is three times the
volume of yesterday. The rumour seems to have taken hold."


The rumour was also circulating on the stock market in London.


Sacyr Vallehermoso said on November 15 that it had increased its
holding in Spanish oil group Repsol to nearly 20 percent.


Two days earlier, the head of the Spanish construction company
had ruled out any withdrawal from Eiffage to finance an increased
holding in Repsol-YPF, saying that the two investments were
independent.
