The international community, and in particular the African Union,
have failed to act to hold Zimbabwe to account, Amnesty
International said on Thursday.


In a letter published in The Guardian daily, the London-based
human rights organisation's Africa programme director wrote that
the AU's actions thus far constituted "far too weak a response".


"What more do we need to witness before the African Union or the
UN tell the Zimbabwean government 'enough is enough'?" Kolawole
Olaniyan wrote.


"International condemnation has freely flowed, but little action
has followed. Although the African Union has called for human
rights 'to be respected' in Zimbabwe, this is far too weak a
response."


Criticism of the Zimbabwean regime's violent campaign against the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has deepened in
recent days, with other African leaders joining a Western outcry
over President Robert Mugabe's tactics.


The southern African country is also in the midst of an economic
crisis characterised by an inflation rate of 1,730 percent,
shortages of basic commodities and fuel.


"Accountability for human rights violations is central to the
African Union's own Constitutive Act, and that body needs to show
that it has the political will to hold the government of Zimbabwe
to accont for these atrocities," Olaniyan wrote.
