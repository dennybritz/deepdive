South Korean officials said Thursday they will issue warnings on
the use of the avian influenza drug Tamiflu following reports of
severe psychological side affects on Japanese users.


"We plan to issue a special document to doctors and pharmacists
that notifies them of recent reports of suicides and strange
behaviour by people who have taken the drug," said Shin Joon-soo,
an official with the Korea Food and Drug Administration.


Japan has ordered the importer of Tamiflu to warn that teenagers
should not be prescribed the drug, after further reports of
abnormal behaviour by patients.


The health ministry in Tokyo said it had received reports that
two teenagers jumped off the second floor of their houses and
broke their legs after taking Tamiflu.


"The document will also advise medical experts to report
immediately to officials when witnessing similar mental
symptoms," Shin was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying.


Swiss drugmaker Roche, the manufacturer of Tamiflu, has denied
any connection between the drug and the incidents.


South Korea was hit hard by bird flu between December 2003 and
March 2004 and suffered several more outbreaks this winter, but
no one in the country has died of the disease.
