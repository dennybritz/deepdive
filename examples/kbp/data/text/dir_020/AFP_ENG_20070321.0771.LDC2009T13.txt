Chinese share prices extended their record breaking run, adding
0.82 percent in the Thursday morning session on strong follow-
through support after hitting all- time highs on Wednesday,
dealers said.


They said energy and steel stocks were in focus as investors also
took their cues from solid gains on Wall Street overnight and
continued strength in the Chinese currency, the yuan.


Fresh fund inflows have helped trigger the latest round of buying
that pushed the Shanghai index Wednesday to an all-time high of
3,057.38 points, taking gains over the last 15 months to about
150 percent, dealers added.


"The market was bolstered by strong gains recorded in overseas
markets such as the US and a new all-time high set by the key
index also spurred fresh fund inflows," said Cao Yan, an analyst
at Soochow Securities.


"The upward trend is likely to be maintained in the short run on
the back of the strong yuan and sales of stock investment fund
products which will reach at least 50 billion yuan for March," he
said.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended the morning up 25.21
points at 3,082.59, after touching a record 3,092.24.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 26.55 points or 0.83 percent at
3,238.97 and the Shenzhen A-share Index rose 8.0 points or 0.95
percent at 848.96, after hitting its own new record of 849.20.


The yuan ended at 7.7341 against the dollar Wednesday, up from
the previous finish of 7.7360, and continued firmer Thursday.
