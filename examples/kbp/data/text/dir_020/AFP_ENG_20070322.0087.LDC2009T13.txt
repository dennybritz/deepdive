A commission seeking the truth about deadly violence in East
Timor in 1999 said Thursday it is to hear from the then president
of Indonesia, whose military was blamed for the unrest.


The Indonesian-East Timor Truth and Friendship Commission is to
hear from former president BJ Habibie at its next session, its
co-chairman Benjamin Mangkudilaga told AFP.


Other key figures from the time, including Carlos Ximenes Felipe
Belo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for efforts related to East
Timor, are also due to testify.


"They have all confirmed they will come and the hearing will be
held in Jakarta from March 26-30," said Mangkudilaga.


Violence erupted in East Timor in 1999 around a UN-administered
vote for independence following 24 years of occupation by
neighbouring Indonesia.


Militia gangs, which the UN has said were recruited and directed
by Indonesia's military, killed about 1,400 people and destroyed
much of the infrastructure in the former Portuguese colony.


Indonesia and East Timor formed the 10-member commission in 2005
to establish the truth about the violence. It held its first
hearing last month and plans to invite 70 people to testify by
June.


An Indonesian rights court set up to try military officers and
officials for atrocities in East Timor was widely condemned as a
sham for failing to jail any Indonesians.


Impoverished East Timor holds a presidential election next month
and there are fears fresh unrest could mar the vote.
