A massive landslide in Malaysia's new administrative capital of
Putrajaya Thursday forced the evacuation of at least 1,000
residents and buried 23 cars, police said.


Tonnes of earth tumbled down a hill 10 metres (30 feet) behind an
apartment complex of three 15-storey blocks early Thursday,
forcing residents to flee, police said.


"Nobody is buried alive or trapped under the rubble," acting
Putrajaya police chief Abdul Razak Abdul Majid was quoted as
saying by the Bernama news agency.


Fire and rescue teams checking the landslide site using motion
detectors had not found anyone buried in the mud, Bernama said.


Abdul Razak said the residents were sheltering at a nearby
community centre and school.


"We are waiting for engineers from the Public Works Institute to
confirm whether there will be further earth movements in the
area," he said.


"Only then will a decision be made whether to allow the residents
to return to their apartment units."


The landslides follow heavy rains overnight in Putrajaya.


Heavy rains earlier this week also forced the evacuation of over
600 residents Wednesday from Shah Alam, a large suburb southwest
of capital Kuala Lumpur.


Landslides are common in Malaysia, where housing developments are
often built on or next to hilly areas.


In May last year, four people were killed and 43 homes destroyed
in a landslide in a hilly area of the capital's north-eastern
suburbs after unusually heavy rains.


In 1993 a landslide triggered by heavy rains caused the nearby
12-storey Highland Towers condominium to collapse, killing 48
people -- mostly children and maids who were left at home while
parents were at work.
