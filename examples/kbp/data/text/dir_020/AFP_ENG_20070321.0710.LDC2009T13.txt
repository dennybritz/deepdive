Japan's Hitachi Ltd. said Thursday that one of its subsidiaries
would cut about 4,400 jobs by closing a plant in Mexico, as the
technology firm reorganises its hard drive manufacturing
operations.


The job cuts stemming from the closure of the Guadalajara plant
operated by Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Inc. are
equivalent to about 11 percent of the unit's 40,000-strong global
workforce, Hitachi said in a statement.


The closure is part of a broader restructuring plan that the
company hopes will save it 300 million dollars over the next five
years.
