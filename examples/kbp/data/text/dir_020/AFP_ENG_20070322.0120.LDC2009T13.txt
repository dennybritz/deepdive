French luxury products group Hermes reported on Thursday an
8.7-percent rise in net profit last year with help from the sale
of its interest in German company Leica Camera.


Chief executive Patrick Thomas told AFP that the company intended
to maintain this rate of profitability in 2007, raising net
profit "at the same rate as sales", or eight to 10 percent.


Hermes said that net profit last year totalled 268.4 million
euros (356.5 million dollars), including a cpaital gain of 14.1
million euros from the sale of 36.2 percent of Leica Camera.


The outcome fell short of the figure of 271.36 million euros
broadly expected by analysts contacted by news service Thomson
Financial.


Operating profit rose by 8.3 percent to 415.2 million euros, or
by 11.3 percent on a basis of constant exchange rates. This was
slightly higher than 411.59 million euros expected by analysts.


The gross operating margin was 27.4 percent from 26.9 percent in
2005 and the net margin was 17.7 percent from 17.3 percent.


In February, Hermes had published sales data for 2006 showing an
increase of 6.1 percent to 1.515 billion euros.
