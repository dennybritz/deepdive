Intel will hold a briefing Monday in Beijing, the US chip giant
said Thursday, amid expectations that it is set to announce plans
to build a huge semiconductor plant in China.


"Our CEO (Paul Otellini) will be there," said a Beijing-based
Intel executive on Thursday.


Intel declined to provide details about the press conference, to
be held in the Great Hall of the People, the parliamentary
building in the middle of Beijing.


However, speculation was heating up following an announcement by
the Chinese government earlier this month that it had given
approval for an Intel plan to build a 2.5-billion-dollar
semiconductor plant.


The 12-inch (300-millimetre) integrated wafer plant in Dalian
city in northeast China's Liaoning province would have a monthly
capacity of 52,000 chips, the National Development and Reform
Commission said in a brief release.


Intel, which has invested about one billion dollars in China so
far, already has major assembly and test operations in Shanghai
and Chengdu, in the country's southwest.


At 90 nanometers, the chips made in Dalian would be some of the
most advanced semiconductors manufactured in China.
