China will from May 1 impose new limits on liquids in airline
passenger carry-on baggage, in accordance with international
security practices, state media said Thursday.


Those travelling abroad will be allowed to carry just one litre
of liquid in their hand luggage, held in containers of no more
than 100 millilitres each, the China Daily reported.


For domestic flights, similar rules apply, but there is no limit
on the size of the containers, the paper reported, citing a
statement from the civil aviation administration.


Baby milk and medications will be exempt from the new
regulations.


The tougher regulations imposed by China are in line with
international practices developed after British authorities in
August foiled an alleged plot to smuggle innocuous-looking
liquids onto flights and assemble them into bombs.


Similar rules came into effect in the southern Chinese territory
of Hong Kong on Wednesday.
