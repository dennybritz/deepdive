Hong Kong share prices closed 0.89 percent higher Thursday,
bouyed by Wall Street's sharp gains overnight after the US
Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold and hinted at an
easier stance to come, dealers said.


They said the latest gains prompted investors who had bet the
market would fall to cover their positions, especially in HSBC,
while strong results from Li Ka- shing's flagship companies
Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa provided additional support.


The Hang Seng Index rose 173.84 points at 19,690.25, off a low of
19,621.26 and high of 19,813.21. Turnover was 57.7 billion
dollars (7.4 billion US)&gt;


HSBC was up 2.30 dollars or 1.71 percent at 136.50 dollars.
