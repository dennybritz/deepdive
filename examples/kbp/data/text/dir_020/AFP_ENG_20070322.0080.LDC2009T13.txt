Hundreds of Iraqi and US troops have pushed into troubled areas
of western Baghdad, arresting 31 suspects and impounding
containers of nitric acid and chlorine, the US military said
Thursday.


Around 1,100 US soldiers and 500 Iraqi troops swept into the
Mansur district on Wednesday, conducting house to house searches
in what the military said was a bid to clear the area of Al-Qaeda
and militiamen.


Iraqi forces detained 20 suspects and US troops another 11, while
two weapons caches were seized with containers of nitric acid and
chlorine, the military said in a statement.


Last Friday, two policemen were killed and 350 civilians required
hospital treatment after insurgents detonated three trucks filled
with toxic chlorine gas in the seventh insurgent gas attack this
year alone.


Codenamed Arrowhead Strike Nine, the latest raid is part of
Operation Fardh al- Qanoon (Imposing Law) that was launched last
month to regain control of Baghdad and quell deadly sectarian
warfare between Sunnis and Shiites.
