A US soldier was killed in Baghdad when gunmen ambushed his
combat patrol during an ongoing American-led security operation
in the war-torn Iraqi capital, the US military said Thursday.


The soldier was killed when the patrol was attacked with small
arms fire in a western sector of Baghdad on Wednesday, the
military said.


The latest deaths brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 20 invasion four years ago to 3,223, according to an
AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
