Milwaukee's Australian center Andrew Bogut and forward Charlie
Villanueva will miss the rest of the National Basketball
Association season with injuries the Bucks said Wednesday.


The team announced the news during Wednesday's game against the
Los Angeles Clippers.


Sidelined due to left midfoot sprain, Bogut missed a game for the
first time in his young career.


The top overall pick in the 2005 draft, Bogut suffered the injury
against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 7, and re-injured it in
practice on Tuesday.


Bogut will have his foot immobilized for two to four weeks, and
is expected to resume basketball activity in six to eight weeks.


Bogut averaged 12.3 points and a team-leading 8.9 rebounds in 66
games this season.


Villanueva is out due to a recurring right shoulder injury that
will require arthroscopic surgery. The second-year forward had
missed the previous two games because of the injury.


Acquired from Toronto in an offseason trade that included T.J.
Ford, Villanueva has appeared in just 39 games this season. He
was averaging 11.8 points and 5.8 rebounds.
