Indonesia has raised the alert level for smoking Mount Batutara
volcano, warning fishermen and others to stay away from the
remote island it is situated on.


"We recommend... to be alert and not to go close to the
mountain," local official Sentianus Medi said, as the alert level
was raised to the second of four possible levels.


The volcano is located on a normally deserted island in the
Flores sea, but fishermen and others who occasionally land there
were warned to stay at least two kilometres (1.2 miles) away.


"The mountain has shown increased activity with smoke rising
between 500 metres (1,650 feet) to 1,500 metres above the
volcano," said Medi.


However, experts said an eruption was not imminent.


Indonesia sits on the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire", where
continental plates meet, causing frequent volcanic and seismic
activity.
