Malaysia made its largest single drug bust ever when it seized 14
million ringgit (four million dollars) worth of fake sex pills
labelled "Miagra", reports said Thursday.


Health Minister Chua Soi Lek said his ministry's enforcement team
and customs officials last week detained a container from
Singapore loaded with 142 boxes containing 1.4 million Miagra
capsules.


"Initially, the owner of the container claimed that they were
vitamin pills," Chua was quoted as saying by state news agency
Bernama.


"On inspection they were found to be fake and unregistered drugs
which contained Sildenafil of less than 50 milligrams per
capsule, the same as in the Viagra brand of drug," he said.


"It is a fake drug, as it can be said to be similar to the
original (Viagra)," he said.


The counterfeit drugs, closely resembling the blue pills of the
genuine Viagra brand, were destined for Malaysian and Thai
markets, Chua said.


The Star daily reported that the ministry was still conducting
investigations to identify the company involved in the scam.


If found guilty, the culprits could face a fine of 50,000
ringgit, a sentence of three years in jail, or both.
