Suspected separatist rebels have killed two Muslim men in
Thailand's restive south, police said Thursday, as concern grew
about escalating sectarian tension in the region.


A villager, 67, was shot dead late Wednesday when militants broke
into his house in Pattani, one of three southern provinces where
more than 2,000 people have been killed in separatist unrest that
erupted in January 2004.


On Thursday morning, the decomposed body of a Muslim teenager was
found floating in a river in Yala province. Police are
investigating, but said they suspect the young man was also
killed by Islamic insurgents.


The attacks come at a time of increasing tension in the region
bordering Malaysia, with protests flaring after the massacre of
nine Buddhists on a bus last week and the shooting of two Muslim
schoolchildren at the weekend.


The National Intelligence Agency said Tuesday that Islamic
separatists have stepped up their attacks in Thailand's Muslim-
majority provinces in the hope of sparking a broader sectarian
and ethnic conflict.


The military has imposed a curfew on parts of the region, where
violence has surged despite a raft of peace-building measures
proposed by Thailand's military-backed government.


Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont on Wednesday made a brief visit
to Pattani province, and vowed to send more police and armed
forces to the stricken region to try and curb the escalating
bloodshed.
