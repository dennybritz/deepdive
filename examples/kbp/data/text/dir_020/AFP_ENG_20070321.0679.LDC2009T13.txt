Europeans are too politically correct, and individual freedom of
expression should always trump the rights of groups, European
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in an interview
published on Thursday.


Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Barroso said: "We have to show
respect for all communities but the fundamental right of freedom
of expression is for me more important than other collective
rights."


He also told the paper: "We should be aware of people who,
sometimes for good reasons, try to establish what I call private
moral codes, for this or that, be it climate change, religious
behaviour or any kind of social behaviour."


Barroso added his own views on the ongoing controversy in Britain
over regulations for religious clothing, commenting that the
Muslim veil "should not be banned just as girls should not be
forced to wear it."


"I have no doubts. In the Europe I want, the right to choose has
primacy."
