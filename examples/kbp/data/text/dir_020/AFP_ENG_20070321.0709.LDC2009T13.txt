Hong Kong share prices opened 1.24 percent higher Thursday on
expectations of strong results from blue chips Cheung Kong and
Hutchison Whampoa, dealers said.


They said the market was also boosted by speculation about a
possible interest rate cut in the United States, after the Fed
kept the rate unchanged at its last meeting.


The Hang Seng Index opened up 241.32 points at 19,757.73.
