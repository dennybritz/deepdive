North Korea's chief nuclear envoy departed Beijing for Pyongyang
on Thursday on an Air Koryo flight, an official with the airline
told AFP, following an apparent breakdown in disarmament talks.


"Kim Kye-Gwan was on the flight and it has left," said the
official, who was in charge of boarding for the 3:00 pm (0700
GMT) departure but did not want to be named.
