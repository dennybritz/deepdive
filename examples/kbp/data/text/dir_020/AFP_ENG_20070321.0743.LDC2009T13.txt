China National Offshore Oil Corp, the country's top offshore oil
producer, plans to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange this year,
state media said Thursday.


Technical problems such as foreign exchange management are "not
fundamental policy difficulties," said Fu Chengyu, the Hong Kong-
listed company's chairman, according to the China Daily.


"When these are settled, our initial public offering (in the
A-share market) plan will get the green light from the
authorities this year," Fu said.


He said such problems also confront China Mobile, which according
to the securities regulators may list in the domestic stock
market this year.


"If China Mobile can float shares within this year, we suppose we
deserve the same privilege," Fu said.


The two companies, both incorporated and listed in Hong Kong, are
known as "red chips."


It has become a trend for more and more Chinese companies listed
overseas to be attracted by soaring share prices in the domestic
stock market and to seek IPOs at home.
