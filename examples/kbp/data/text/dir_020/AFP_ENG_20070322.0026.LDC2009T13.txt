Pakistan on Thursday successfully test-fired a nuclear-capable
cruise missile for the third time, the military said.


The Hatf VII Babur missile has a range of 700 kilometres (435
miles) and can carry all kinds of warheads, it said in a
statement.


"The Babur... is a terrain-hugging, radar-avoiding cruise
missile, whose range has now been enhanced to 700 kilometres," it
said. The missile's previous range was 500 kilometres.


"It is a highly manoeuvrable missile with pinpoint accuracy."


The test was witnessed by the chairman of Pakistan's Joint Chiefs
of Staff Committee, General Ehsan ul Haq, as well as senior
military officials and scientists, it said.


Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat
Aziz have congratulated the scientists and engineers on this
"very important success", it said.


The cruise missile was first tested in 2005 and again in March
last year.


Pakistan did not say if it had informed nuclear-armed rival India
about the test in advance. They have an agreement to notify each
other about tests of ballistic missiles but not cruise missiles.


In February Pakistan signed a historic deal with India to cut the
risk of atomic weapons accidents.


The neighbours have routinely conducted missile tests since
carrying out tit- for-tat nuclear detonations in May 1998.
