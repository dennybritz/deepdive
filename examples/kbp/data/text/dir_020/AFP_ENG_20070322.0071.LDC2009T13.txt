Chinese share prices extended record gains Thursday, adding 0.45
percent on Wall Street's sharp overnight advance after the US
Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold, dealers said.


They said accompanying remarks by the Fed were taken to mean the
rate tightening cycle had ended, clearing the way for stocks to
rise generally.


Turnover was exceptionally heavy once again at some 22 billion
dollars as investors ploughed into stocks so as not to miss out
on this latest upturn only three weeks after a nine percent crash
in Shanghai sparked turmoil on the global markets.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, closed up 13.85 points at 3,071.23 on turnover of
112.65 billion yuan (14.54 billion US dollars).


The inflow of fresh funds pushed the Shanghai Composite to a
record close of 3,057.38 points Wednesday, taking gains over the
last 15 months to more than 150 percent.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 14.61 points or 0.45 percent at
3,227.02 on turnover of 112.14 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index rose 3.08 points or 0.37 percent to 844.05, also a
new record, on turnover of 58.60 billion yuan.
