Australia's second largest retailer Coles Group will be split and
sold in three separate lots in order to maximise profits from a
sale, it was reported Thursday.


The Australian Financial Review said the Coles board would sign-
off on the 20 billion dollar (16.2 billion US) staged sale at a
meeting Friday.


The the auction plan will avoid the prospect of a single private
equity buyer getting a "bulk discount" through a bid for the
entire company, it said, without giving any sources for the
report.


It said discount supermarket store Target would be sold first,
followed by stationery and business supplies group Officeworks,
with the Coles supermarkets, liquor division and general
merchandise outlet Kmart the final offering on the block.


Bidders can make offers for the entire company but only via
separate proposals of each of the three asset parcels, the
newspaper said.


Coles said last month that it was considering selling after its
advisers received several informal approaches.


An 18.2-billion-dollar (14.4-billion US) takeover bid from a US-
based private equity consortium headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
(KKR) collapsed last October.


At the time, Coles said the 15.25 dollar a share offer from the
syndicate substantially undervalued the company.


Coles shares were up 27 cents at 15.95 dollars in late afternoon
trading in a rising overall market.
