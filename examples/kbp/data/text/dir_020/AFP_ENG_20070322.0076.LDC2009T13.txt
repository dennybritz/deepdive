A Hong Kong horse racing official said Thursday remote-controlled
devices found buried in a racetrack could have harmed jockeys and
horses, and did not rule out they were used to rig races.


Chief stipendiary steward Jamie Stier, of the Hong Kong Jockey
Club, said the police were examining the mystery objects.


"The devices have the potential and ability to be very disruptive
to the horses and the racing -- if not dangerous," Stier told
AFP.


He said the police were assessing the intended purpose of the two
devices, which were reportedly designed to fire some type of
projectile, and would investigate the possibility of a race-
fixing conspiracy.


"We keep a very open mind. We will explore all avenues.
Currently, the devices are in the hand of the police and they are
now conducting their own investigation," Stier said.


"We will try and establish the intended use of the devices," he
said.


The instruments, reminiscent of a plot from a Dick Francis novel,
were discovered hours before evening races at Happy Valley
racecourse on Wednesday.


Jockey Club chief executive officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges
told Chinese- language newspaper Ming Pao Daily News that they
were similar to an air conditioner compressor which could cause a
loud bang of air.


He said this could significantly disturb horses during running.


It was not clear how the devices were embedded in the turf, and
Engelbrecht- Bresges denied there had been a security lapse at
the racecourse, the centre of which is a public park.


On Thursday, police stepped up patrols at the racecourse. Stier
said results of the investigation could be revealed within days.
