Dutch Olympic champion Pieter van den Hoogenband Thursday
declared he was clean and had faith that his swimming rivals were
too.


The 29-year-old triple Olympic champion is facing up to what is
likely to be his fourth and last world championships here next
week before he bows out after next year's Beijing Olympics.


Amid suspicions of undetected doping cases in the sport, Hoogie,
as he is known, said he hoped other competitors were being drug-
tested as much as he was.


"People around me know that I get tested a lot. I would like to
know if other swimmers are more tested than me," he told a press
conference Thursday.


"I have been tested 40 to 50 times in one year, but I think the
other competitors I'm racing also get a lot of tests."


Some coaches and former swimmers have been suspicious of drug
concerns heading into the championships, but van den Hoogenband
said the concentration of out-of- competition testing made the
conditions tougher for drug cheats to prosper.


"It's going to be very tough for cheaters to swim here and cheat
because that's one of the rules, you don't cheat, you don't take
drugs," he said.


"I don't know the ins and outs of it all, but for myself they
test me a lot and hopefully they also test the other competitors.


"Then it would be good because everything is going well.


"I am not using anything, I'm clean, they can test me whenever
they want and I am only focusing on swimming fast."


Australian head coach Alan Thompson revealed on Wednesday that
one of his swimmers had been drug-tested four times in the last
10 days ahead of the world titles.
