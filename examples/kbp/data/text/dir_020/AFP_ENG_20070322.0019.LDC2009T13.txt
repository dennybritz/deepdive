Australian share prices closed up 1.60 percent Thursday with
investors buoyed by the US Federal Reserve decision to keep US
interest rates steady, dealers said.


The benchmark SP/ASX 200 jumped 93.8 points to 5,955.7 while the
broader All Ordinaries index rose 89.1 points to 5,935.4.


The latest gains take the market back to within sight of the
record finish of 6,044.0 hit on February 26, just one day before
a crash in Shanghai sparked a massive sell-off across the global
markets.


A strong performance overnight in New York after remarks by the
Fed were taken to reflect a softer stance on monetary policy
buoyed sentiment amid speculation here local interest rates could
be headed for another hike shortly.
