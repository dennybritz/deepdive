The government of emergency-ruled Bangladesh has suspended the
right of suspects in corruption cases to apply for bail, an
official said Thursday.


The military-backed interim government is waging an anti-
corruption corruption crackdown targeting the country's elite
politicians, business tycoons and bureaucrats.


"The government has amended a rule so that an accused in a
corruption case cannot appeal for bail," law ministry official
Tusabar Ali told AFP.


President Iajuddin Ahmed imposed emergency rule on January 11. He
also stepped down as head of the previous interim government and
cancelled disputed elections scheduled for January 22.


The new government was installed the following day, headed by
former central bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed, and has pledged to
clean up Bangladesh's notoriously corrupt politics before holding
fresh polls.


Its anti-corruption campaign has seen the detention of more than
45 high-profile figures on graft allegations, including the son
of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Hundreds more are being
investigated.
