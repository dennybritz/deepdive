Factional clashes flared in Gaza on Thursday after the death of a
member of president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party in unclear
circumstances, Palestinian security sources said.


Early on Thursday a Fatah member was killed and three others
wounded, all members of the Hilles family, in an exchange of fire
the exact cause of which was not immediately known.


Following the death, Fatah members of the Hilles family exchanged
fire with Hamas fighters from its so-called Executive Force in
the Shujaiya neighbourhood in Gaza City.


A spokesman for the force, Islam Shahwan, said members of the
Hilles family seized six members of the force and burned two of
its cars.


In a separate incident, an officer with the preventative security
force loyal to Abbas, was wounded after unknown gunmen fired on
him in the southern town of Khan Yunis.


Thursday's unrest comes less than a week after the forming of a
Palestinian national unity government on Saturday, uniting
secular Fatah with Islamist Hamas and independents.


The inauguration of the new coalition was supposed to stop the
factional violence between Fatah and Hamas, which has killed
scores of Palestinians.


The clashes had largely ceased in Gaza since the two rivals
struck a deal to form the government in a summit in Mecca in
early February, though there have been occasional flare-ups of
gunfire.
