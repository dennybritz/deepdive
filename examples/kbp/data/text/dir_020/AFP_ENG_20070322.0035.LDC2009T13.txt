North Korea's chief nuclear envoy entered Beijing airport on
Thursday, an AFP reporter there said, apparently to take a
scheduled flight back to Pyongyang following a breakdown in
disarmament talks.


Kim Kye-Gwan passed reporters waiting at the entrance to the
airport at about 2:30 pm (0630 GMT) without making any comment.


A flight with North Korean national carrier Air Koryo was due to
depart Beijing for Pyongyang at 3:00pm.
