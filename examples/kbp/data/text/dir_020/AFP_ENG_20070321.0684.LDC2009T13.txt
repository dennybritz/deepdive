The United States has complained to Italy over the exchange of a
kidnapped Italian journalist for several militants of the Afghan
Islamic militia Taliban, a US official said Wednesday.


The official said the swap to gain the release of journalist
Daniele Mastrogiancomo on Monday raised the risk of similar
kidnappings of NATO and Afghan troops battling the formerly
ruling Taliban.


"Although we are pleased with the release of the Italian
journalist, Mr Mastrogiancomo, we do have some concerns about the
circumstances surrounding his release," the official said.


"It is US policy to use every appropriate resource to gain the
safe return of hostages, but to make no concessions to
individuals of groups holding those hostages," she said, adding
that the United States "did not and do not approve of concessions
to terrorists."


"In this case, these concessions caught the US by surprise.


"We believe that these concessions increase the risk to NATO and
to Afghan troops and to the Afghan people," she continued, saying
Washington had "communicated those concerns" to Italy through
diplomatic channels.


The Afghan president's office admitted that it released some
Taliban prisoners to gain Mastrogiancomo's freedom, without
stating how many.


A Taliban commander told an Afghan news agency that five Taliban
prisoners were released in the deal.
