A former US sailor was indicted Wednesday on federal charges of
sending classified information on the movement of US warships in
the Middle East and how they could be attacked to suspected
terrorists.


The US attorney for the District of Connecticut, Kevin O'Connor,
announced the two-count indictment against Hassan Abujihaad, 31
-- formerly known as Paul Hall -- of Phoenix, Arizona.


Abujihaad, who was arrested on March 7 in Phoenix, is set to face
a judge on Friday.


If found guilty, he faces up to 25 years in prison.


According to the indictment, Abujihaad was in contact throughout
2001 with British nationals based in London that operated
websites supporting people engaged in acts of terrorism.


Abujihaad allegedly sent via e-mail in the spring of 2001
information on the movement of US Navy ships deploying for
operations against the Taliban and Al- Qaeda. At the time he was
serving as an enlisted man aboard one of the ships.


Abujihaad left the navy in January 2002, but the information that
he sent as well as his military e-mail address was discovered
when British authorities in 2003 confiscated computers belonging
to British nationals that operated the websites.


Federal prosecutors in Connecticut are involved because the
computer server handling the Internet traffic is located that
state.
