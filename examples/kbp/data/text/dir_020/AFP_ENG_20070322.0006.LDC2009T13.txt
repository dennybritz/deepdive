Chinese patriots have collected more than 250,000 dollars to send
teenager Hua Tian to next year's Olympics as China's first ever
equestrian competitor, state media reported Thursday.


Money and messages of support have poured in from all over the
world for Hua, a talented rider who lacks just one thing -- a
horse good enough to meet Olympic standards.


Hua, 17, launched an appeal on Wednesday for money to buy a horse
so he can compete in the 2008 Beijing Games.


Within 24 hours two million yuan (256,000 dollars) had flooded
into the fund -- enough for a selection of up to five mounts --
his father Hua Shan was quoted as saying.


"A businessman from Guangdong province (in southern China) whose
name I cannot reveal sent us 1.5 million yuan which is already in
the bank," Hua senior told The First newspaper.


"All these people have been fantastic and I can't thank them
enough."


His son, who has been riding since he was four, has shown
outstanding  ability during regular competition in Europe over
the past few seasons.


Hua is based in England where he has been trained in Wiltshire by
top Australian equestrian coaches, Lucinda and Clayton
Fredericks.


They describe him as a natural talent with the ambition to become
a future star.


"All that stands in his way is having a horse of equal caliber,"
they said on their website.


The Chinese youngster has already found a name for his horse --
'For the Motherland'.
