Sri Lankan troops were engaged in clearing operations on
Thursday, the day after simultaneous Tamil Tiger guerrilla
attacks left at least 20 people dead and dozens more wounded,
officials said.


Fighting on Wednesday in the eastern district of Batticaloa and
Muhamalai in the north of the war-torn island claimed the lives
of 15 Tamil Tiger rebels, four government troops and a civilian,
officials said.


Some 40 civilians were also injured in the fighting in
Batticaloa, prompted by an attack by some 300 Tiger rebels.


There was no immediate word on the fighting from the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have been waging a separatist
war since 1972.


According to the defence ministry, the clearing operations have
led to the recovery of a large haul of weapons, ammunition and
mines left behind by the Tigers after they pulled back to their
jungle stronghold of Thoppigala.


Official figures show 148,419 people were listed as internally
displaced in the Batticaloa district since the military captured
a key base of the Tigers in January.


Since then, the military has also stepped up attacks against
Tamil Tiger boats and claimed sinking three large supply ships
that were allegedly trying to smuggle weapons into the island.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
since December 2005. The fighting comes despite a truce in place
since February 2002.
