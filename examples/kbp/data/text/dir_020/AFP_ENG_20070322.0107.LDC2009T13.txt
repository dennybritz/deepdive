Police fired tear gas in violent clashes with protesters who had
blocked a key railway in eastern China, witnesses said Thursday,
in the latest case of rising social unrest plaguing the country.


Witnesses said thousands of protesters and onlookers gathered on
Wednesday at the main railway station in Guixi township, Jiangxi
province, to demonstrate against a pending merger of their town
with a larger city.


China's government-controlled press also reported on the
incident, but said there were around 200 protesters and did not
make any reference to the violent clashes.


Pictures posted on the Internet showed hundreds of riot police
dressed in military fatigues and cordoning off an area in front
of the train station.


"Police injured at least 40 people, this made many people angry
so they began turning over a car," a man named Chen who runs a
food shop across from the railway station, told AFP by telephone.


"At five o'clock (in the afternoon), special police forces came
in firing tear gas, so this led the crowd to disperse."


When the crowd began turning over the car, police began firing
their guns into the air to warn the protesters off, he said.


The People's Daily reported on its website that about 200
protesters blocked the railway line that runs from eastern
Shanghai to southwest China's Yunnan province, while "several
hundred" others watched the protest.


Both the state press and locals said calm had returned to the
town Thursday.


Guixi officials refused to comment when contacted by AFP.
