Two British men and a Canadian have been arrested in Indonesia's
staunchly Muslim province of Aceh for possessing marijuana,
police said Thursday.


The men were arrested "last Friday while they were smoking
cannabis" on a beach, police spokesman Jodi Heriyadi said.


The three foreigners are Josep Daniel, 24, Albert Simon Benard,
36, and a Canadian man identified only as 40-year-old
Fandenbergmark, he said.


The British and Canadian embassies had already been informed of
the arrests, he said, without elaborating further.


Indonesia has traditionally handed down stiff penalties for drug
traffickers and users, with 35 people on death row for narcotics
offences.
