PSV Eindhoven left back Sun Xiang has been ruled out of China's
international against Australia on Saturday with a knee injury,
the Dutch club said on its website.


"Sun will not be on international duty for two friendlies due to
a knee injury," it said.


The 25-year-old, China's first player to compete in Champions
League matches, picked up a right knee injury in PSV's game
against Ajax on Sunday.


He is suffering from pain and will stay in Eindhoven for
treatment, the website said.


Sun, who joined the Dutch champions on loan in January from
Shanghai Shenhua, will also miss China's match against Uzbekistan
in Macau on March 24.
