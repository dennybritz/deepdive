Aravane Rezai, the French prodigy who was banned along with her
father-coach Arsalan from Roland Garros on Saturday, made a quick
exit from the Miami WTA and ATP Masters Series tournament
Wednesday.


"I don't have anything to say," the 20-year-old said to four
waiting journalists after falling 6-1, 6-4 to Russian Ekaterina
Bychkova in the first round.


Rezai and her father were banned from the Roland Garros facility
- home of the French Open - for two years following allegations
of violent behaviour towards the French Fed Cup captain.


The player was told by the French Tennis Federation that she
cannot use the facilities, but can still compete in the second
Grand Slam of the year, which starts on May 28.


Her father, however, is banned from not only the venue but also
all tournaments organised by the French Tennis Federation.


Rezai had a breakthrough year last season, reaching the last 16
at the US Open and the third round at Roland Garros.


She caught the imagination of the French media because of her
Iranian Muslim roots but her father made almost as many headlines
for his behaviour.


He faced serious allegations from France's Fed Cup captain
Georges Goven, with whom he had a violent altercation in
February.


Arsalan had been in hot water before after threatening the father
of a rival French tennis player in the juniors in 2004.
