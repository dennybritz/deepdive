Police Thursday said they will not pursue an investigation into a
box holding a syringe and plastic vials found at a hotel used by
World Swimming Championships athletes.


They were discovered in a common area at the Parkview Hotel in
the beachside suburb of St Kilda on Tuesday.


Traces of cocaine were found in the box but tests found no
illicit drugs in the vials of liquid.


"The police investigation has been closed and no one had been
charged with any offence," said a Victoria police spokeswoman.


A number of swimmers were staying on the floor where the box was
found, although the hotel was also being used by guests not
involved in the championships.


World swimming's governing body, FINA, and Australian Customs
were notified at the time of the incident, police added.


The 1998 world championships in Perth were overshadowed when
Human Growth Hormone was found in a Chinese competitor's luggage
and four Chinese swimmers tested positive for drugs.
