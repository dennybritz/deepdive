Australian authorities on Thursday turned off the tap of a
householder who repeatedly ignored tough water restrictions
introduced to counter the country's worst drought in a century.


Victoria state's City West Water said the man continued to ignore
restrictions and wash his car, despite a formal warning letter
and requests from water patrol officers who scour the city
looking for offenders.


City West managing director Anne Barker said as a result, the
water waster would become the first under penalties introduced
late last year to have his water reduced to a trickle for 48
hours.


"It's the first time we have had to restrict a customer because
of a breach of water restrictions," Barker told reporters.


"We restrict the flow to the property down to two litres per
minute so the customer can still have water that they can use for
cooking and for drinking and flushing toilets, but it won't
provide a shower supply."


Poor rainfall has left Australia's dams depleted, forcing many
cities to ration their water supplies by limiting the use of
water for washing cars and watering lawns.
