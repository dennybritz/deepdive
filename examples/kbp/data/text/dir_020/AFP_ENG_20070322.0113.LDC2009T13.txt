It would be inappropriate for Singapore to make representations
to China on behalf of a jailed correspondent for a Singapore
newspaper, a cabinet minister said Thursday.


Veteran Hong Kong journalist Ching Cheong, chief China
correspondent for Singapore's The Straits Times,  was arrested in
April 2005 and sentenced to five years in jail last year for
spying for Taiwan.


Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's second minister for information,
communications and the arts, said he did not believe Singapore
had made any formal representations on Ching's behalf because the
journalist is not a citizen of the city-state.


"So it would be inappropriate for us as the Singapore government
to have any formal representations on that score," he told the
Foreign Correspondents' Association.


Ching's conviction followed a one-day, closed-door trial. An
appeal was later dismissed.


The journalist has always maintained his innocence.


"He's an employee of a commercial organisation and will have to
deal with the justice system that he's exposed to," Balakrishnan
said.


After his sentencing last year, Ching's newspaper company
appealed to Chinese authorities to show "leniency and compassion"
since he suffers from high blood pressure.


Singapore Press Holdings said Ching had served the company with
distinction since joining in 1996. The company said it would
provide his family with whatever support was needed.


Ching, 57, is imprisoned in Guangzhou, southern China.


His case has attracted international attention, highlighting
fears China is cracking down against foreign and domestic
journalists in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
