Indonesia will not follow South Korea and Japan in issuing
warnings on the use of bird flu drug Tamiflu despite reports it
had caused severe psychological side affects, an official said
Thursday.


"We do not detect any abnormal behaviour from recipients of the
drug," I Nyoman Kandun, a senior health ministry official, told
AFP.


He said there were no plans to issue a Tamiflu warning and that
more than 1,000 doses of the drug had been administered in
Indonesia, the country worst hit by bird flu with a human death
toll of 66.


South Korean officials said Thursday that they would issue
warnings after further reports of abnormal behaviour by patients.


The health ministry in Tokyo said two teenagers in Japan jumped
off the second floor of their houses and broke their legs after
taking Tamiflu.


Japan has ordered the importer of Tamiflu to warn that teenagers
should not be prescribed the drug.


Swiss drugmaker Roche, the manufacturer of Tamiflu, has denied
any connection between the drug and the incidents.


The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has infected 281 people,
mostly in Southeast Asia, killing 169 of them, according to the
World Health Organisation.


There are fears the disease could mutate into a form easily
spread among humans, leading to a flu pandemic with the potential
to kill millions.
