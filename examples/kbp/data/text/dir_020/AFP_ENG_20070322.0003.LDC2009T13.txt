Hong Kong share prices finished the Thursday morning session 1.22
percent higher after sharp gains on Wall Street overnight
following the US Federal Reserve decision to leave interest rates
on hold, dealers said.


They said the Fed appeared also to have left the door open for an
interest rate cut later this year, giving sentiment a real boost,
with the Wall Street lead then being following by the Asian
markets.


They said expectations of positive results announcements from
Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa later in the day also drove the
advance.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 237.70 points at
19,754.11, off a high of 19,772.87 and a low of 19,703.21.
