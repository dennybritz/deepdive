North Korea announced Thursday it would convene a new session of
its rubber- stamp parliament next month, just three days before a
deadline to shut down its main nuclear programme.


The meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly will start on April
11, the North's Korean Central News Agency reported.


The legislature convenes irregularly once or twice a year. The
previous session focused on measures to boost the economy, food
production and military firepower.


Under a six-nation agreement reached on February 13, North Korea
is to shut down and seal its Yongbyon reactor by April 14 in
return for an initial shipment of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil.


In the next phase of the deal, which has no time limit, it should
declare and disable all its nuclear programmes in return for
another 950,000 tons of fuel oil or equivalent aid, as well as
diplomatic benefits.


North Korea also demanded that a US-inspired financial freeze of
its assets in a Macau bank be lifted as part of the first phase.


The United States said on Monday it had struck a deal to release
all 25 million dollars in the accounts.


But at six-party talks in Beijing this week, the North is
refusing to discuss implementing the nuclear deal until all
formalities related to the return of the money have been
completed.
