Darren Lehmann, the all-time leading runscorer in Australia's
Sheffield Shield cricket, said Thursday he was quitting as
captain of the under-performing South Australian team.


Lehmann's decision follows the resignation of state coach Wayne
Phillips after South Australia finished last in the Shield
competition and fourth in the one- day competition.


Lehmann, who has led South Australia since 1998, said he wanted
to continue playing for SA.


"It was an extremely difficult decision but one which I have made
after many months of thought," the former 37-year-old Test
batsman said.


"I have always said that when the time is right, I would make way
for a young successor who I can mentor and work with and I look
forward to doing just that next season.


"I very much look forward to next season, when I will be
wholeheartedly supporting the new South Australian captain."


SA Cricket Association chief executive Mike Deare said a new
captain was not expected to be appointed for several weeks.


Lehmann has scored 13,411 runs from a total of 145 Shield
matches, including those played during three seasons for
Victoria.
