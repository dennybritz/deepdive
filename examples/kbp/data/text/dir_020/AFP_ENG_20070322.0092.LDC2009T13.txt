The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Peter Pace, arrived
in Beijing Thursday to hold talks with China's top military
leaders, a US official said.


Pace would hold talks with his counterpart Liang Guanglie, the
chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army, a US
embassy spokeswoman said.


He would also meet with Defence Minister Cao Gangchuan and Guo
Boxiong, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, she
said.


Pace's meetings come after William Fallon, commander of US forces
in the Pacific, visited China in May and August last year as part
of joint efforts by both nations to build confidence between the
two militaries.


The Pace visit also follows a US announcement last month that it
plans to provide over 400 missiles to Taiwan, the island that
China considers a part of its territory.


Taiwan has been the main obstacle between better Sino-US ties,
with the US concerned that China would seek to retake the island
by force if Taipei should move towards formal declared
independence.
