Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has named his newborn grandson
Prince Abdul Muntaqim, the oil-rich Southeast Asian kingdom
announced Thursday.


The prince, born on Saturday, is the first child of Crown Prince
Al-Muhtadee Billah and his half-Swiss wife Sarah Salleh. He is
second in line to the throne.


A statement on the Brunei government's website said the sultan
bestowed the name on his grandson "with great pleasure."


Brunei's crown prince, who turned 33 last month, married his wife
in 2004 in one of the grandest weddings in Asia in more than a
decade.


If he succeeds his father, he will become the 30th sultan in an
unbroken chain of succession of male rulers in Brunei's more than
600 years as a Malay Muslim kingdom.


The crown prince's wife is the third child of a Bruneian civil
servant and a Swiss-born psychiatric nurse who met while studying
in London in the 1970s.


Brunei, located on the northern edge of Borneo island, draws its
wealth from its vast oil and gas reserves.


The sultan, who is also the prime minister and defence minister,
was once reputed to be the world's richest man before the rise of
technology mogul Bill Gates and other self-made billionaires.
