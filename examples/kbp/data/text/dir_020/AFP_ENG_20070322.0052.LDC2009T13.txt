A US Air Force F-16 fighter made an emergency landing at a
civilian airport in northern Japan on Thursday due to a fuel
leak, but no one was injured, officials said.


The runway of Hakodate Airport was temporarily suspended after
the fighter, from the US Misawa Air Base some 100 kilometres (62
miles) to the south, informed the control tower about the
trouble, an official at the airport said.


"Because a problem with the fuel system was found during the
flight, the aircraft decided to land at Hakodate Airport as a
safety measure," a spokesman for the US military base said.
