A New Zealand artist is planning to exhibit his father's ashes,
saying he was "much more useful dead than he ever was alive", a
report said Thursday.


Nigel Madden, from Napier in the North Island, previously
exhibited photographs of his father Neville, an alcoholic and
one-time radio announcer, lying on a mortuary slab after
suffering a fatal heart attack.


The photographs shown last year in the Norsewood Art Awards
offered an insight into his dysfunctional relationship with his
father, Madden said.


This year Madden plans to display his father's ashes in a pewter
urn, he told the Dominion Post newspaper.


"So, my father's remains function as a symbol and a stand-in for
art," he said.


Madden quoted Spanish painter Pablo Picasso as saying "in art one
must kill one's father".


"It's not often that you get human remains to work with," Madden
added.


The work would be for sale for 2,000 dollars (1,400 US), though
the artist admitted he was not hopeful of finding a buyer.
