Slovakia said Sunday that it would make improvement of the
conditions of Europe's largest minority, the Roma or gypsies, one
of its main priorities when it takes over the chairmanship of the
Council of Europe in November.


Slovakia will "insist on" greater efforts by states,
international and intergovernmental organisations to address
their problems, the foreign ministry said in a news release to
mark the International Day of the Roma.


"A large part of the Roma suffer serious social problems, in many
case based on racial prejudices or negative stereotypes by the
majority," it added, referring to Europe's estimated 8.0-10.0
million-strong minority.


Slovakia will head the 46-member organisation that promotes
democracy and human rights from November until May next year.


The condition of Slovakia's own large gypsy community, which
accounts for around 7.0 percent of the 5.38 million population,
has frequently been criticised.


The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development
highlighted their low learning achievement, with almost 75.0
percent not obtaining more primary school education, in a report
last week.


The left-dominated coalition government includes the far-right
Slovak Nationalist Party whose leader, Jan Slota, is famed for
his anti-gypsy declarations.
