Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Muhkerjee was seriously injured
when his car and a truck collided in the east of the country, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported early Sunday.


Mukherjee received stitches to the head but was conscious and in
stable condition, West Bengal state Home Secretary P.R. Roy told
PTI.


The accident occurred late Saturday as the 71-year-old Mukherjee
was headed back to the eastern city of Kolkata with other leaders
of the ruling Congress party from Murshidabad.


A truck skidded and hit the minister's car head-on near the
village of Nakashipara, the agency reported. At least four others
were injured in the accident.


Mukherjee was first treated at a local hospital and then
transferred to a district hospital in Krishnanagar. Doctors were
determining whether to move him again to Kolkata for further
treatment.


Mukherjee is a veteran Congress leader from West Bengal state who
has held a host of ministerial posts since the 1970s. Appointed
defence minister in 2004, he took over foreign affairs in October
last year.


He is seen as close to both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and
Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi.


Gandhi's biographer Rasheed Kidwai described Mukherjee as "the
Mister Indispensable of the Congress party."


"When the government is under attack from within the party, the
prime minister and Sonia Gandhi look to him to bail them out,"
Kidwai told AFP last year.
