Amir Khan gave another glimpse of his potential by stopping
fellow Englishman Steffy Bull with a barrage of punches in the
third round of their lightweight bout at the Millennium Stadium
on Saturday.


The 2004 Olympic silver medallist impressed a live TV audience in
the UK and in America, as well as 35,000 excited fans in Cardiff
by claiming his ninth stoppage win in his 12th professional
fight.


Bull, who entered the ring with four defeats in 29 defeats,
managed to stay out of range until lightweight Khan caught up
with him in the third.


Khan, 20, had Bull in trouble moments later when he penned him
against the ropes and whipped in hooks from both fists to the
head before a right to the body and then to head sank Bull to his
knees.


Bull, 30, got up at nine but shook his head and referee Mike
McDonnell waved the fight off one minute and 45 seconds into the
third.
