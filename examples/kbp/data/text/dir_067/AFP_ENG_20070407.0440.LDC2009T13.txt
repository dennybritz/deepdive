The Indian father-in-law of British actress Elizabeth Hurley said
in an interview Sunday that he had cut ties with his son, Arun
Nayer, amid anger over their lavish wedding.


Vinod Nayer told the Sunday Mirror from Mumbai that he and his
wife Joanne felt "publicly humiliated" and treated "like social
outcasts" at the event, which took place in Britain and India
last month.


"Liz and Arun have treated us very shabbily. My heart is heavy
with pain," the newspaper quoted him as saying.


Nayer senior, a textile magnate, claims that the couple seemed to
disrespect Indian relatives and did not act with consideration
towards him and his wife.


"We were pushed into the background like poor relations. This has
broken my heart," the 66-year-old added.


Guests at the wedding celebrations included singer Sir Elton John
and supermodel Elle Macpherson.


"I have decided to cut all ties with my sons...I feel that Liz
and Arun behaved shamefully and placed more importance on showing
off than their own family," Nayer senior added.


He said that he had not spoken to his son since the wedding and
had sent him a letter accusing him of having "disregarded me like
one of your office boys."


"You have shown disrespect to me and my family, plus my dear
friends who have been with me since your birth," the letter
reportedly said.
