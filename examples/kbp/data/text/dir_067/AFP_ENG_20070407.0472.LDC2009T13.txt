Hong Kong tycoon Nina Wang, who died last week, left a fortune
estimated at 4.2 billion dollars to just one person, a media
report said Sunday as speculation grew over who would inherit her
wealth.


Wang's lawyer told the Sunday Morning Post that reports she had
left her huge wealth to charity were wrong.


"There is an individual beneficiary named in the will, not a
charity as some reports suggest," her lawyer Jonathan Midgely was
quoted as telling the Post.


He would not reveal the identity of the beneficiary.


Wang, who died Tuesday aged 69, had become rich after inheriting
her late husband Teddy Wang's Chinachem Group real estate
business, which she built up into one of the city's largest
private companies.


But she also had to fight an eight-year court battle with her
father-in-law over the fortune, which became hotly disputed after
Teddy disappeared, believed kidnapped, in 1990.


Nina died leaving no heirs and never publicly named a
beneficiary, sparking media speculation about who would inherit
her money.


The tycoon, who famously sported mini-skirts and pig-tails well
into her 60s, is to be buried in a Catholic funeral on April 18,
according to reports.
