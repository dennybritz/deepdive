US anti-piracy dogs have sniffed out 12,000 more counterfeit DVDs
in Malaysia that led to the arrest of one person, industry
officials and reports said Sunday.


Black Labradors Lucky and Flo already have a contract out on
their lives in this Muslim-majority nation after their role in a
first bust of knock-offs worth millions of dollars.


The pair are said to be the only dogs in the world trained to
detect chemicals used in optical discs. They were sent by the Los
Angeles-based Motion Picture Association (MPA), which
investigates film piracy.


The MPA's Neil Gane told AFP that Lucky and Flo sniffed out two
locations in northern Malaysia on Saturday that uncovered 12,000
illegal DVDs.


Their first busts last month netted millions of dollars worth of
counterfeit DVDs. Following their success, Malaysian authorities
said that piracy syndicates were trying to kill the dogs and had
put a bounty on their heads.
