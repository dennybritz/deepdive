British troops could be serving in Iraq until as late as 2012,
the Sunday Telegraph reported, quoting a confidential planning
document.


The information comes from the Operational Tour Plot, a
confidential planning document drawn up by defence chiefs and
circulated last month, which lists which units are to be sent on
operations when, the paper said.


The report contradicts the impression given by Prime Minister
Tony Blair when he announced Britain's first major troop
reduction in Iraq in February.


Blair announced that numbers of British troops -- the United
States' main ally in the 2003 invasion -- would be cut from 7,100
to 5,500 by the middle of the year.


He added that British forces would remain in Basra "into 2008,
for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do," but the
report suggests that the deployment may be considerably longer
than that.


Two of four provinces in southern Iraq are now under Iraqi
forces' control, while Maysan is due to be handed over later this
month. Basra province will be controlled by the Iraqi military
from later this year.


The report comes three days after four British soldiers were
killed in an attack in Basra.


The attack brought the British death toll in the country to 140
and prompted renewed media questioning of Blair's strategy over
Iraq, criticism of which has dogged the latter years of his
premiership.
