A roadside bomb explosion killed four US soldiers and wounded
another north of Baghdad, the military said on Sunday.


The incident occurred on Saturday in the restive province of
Diyala where insurgents have stepped up attacks against US troops
in the past few months.


The latest fatalities took the US military's losses in Iraq to 21
this month alone and to 3,269 since the March 2003 invasion,
according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
