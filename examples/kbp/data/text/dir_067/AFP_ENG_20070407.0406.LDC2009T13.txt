The coalition of parties supporting Benin's President Boni Yayi
placed first in last weekend's parliamentary elections, according
to official results published Saturday by the Constitutional
Court.


The coalition of some 20 parties backing Yayi, the Cauri Forces
for an Emerging Benin, won 35 out of 83 seats, followed by the
Alliance for Dynamism and Democracy of former president Necephore
Soglo with 20 seats.
