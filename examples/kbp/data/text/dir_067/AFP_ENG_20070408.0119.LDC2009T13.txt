Israeli troops shot a Palestinian after he stabbed two soldiers
outside the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the flashpoint West Bank
town of Hebron, wounding one seriously, security and medical
sources said.


"Two soldiers were injured by a Palestinian in Hebron, who was
shot and injured," an army spokesman told AFP, correcting an
earlier army report that the assailant had been killed.


According to the Magen David Adom rescue service, one of the
soldiers was taken to a Jerusalem hospital with serious wounds
after he was stabbed in the back. The other sustained light
wounds.


The Palestinian assailant was treated after he was shot in the
leg, a spokesman for the rescue service said.
