Seattle SuperSonics All-Star guard Ray Allen underwent
arthroscopic surgery Saturday to remove bone spurs in both of his
ankles, the National Basketball Association team announced.


Allen will be in a walking boot for three to four weeks and must
rehabilitate the ankle for at least two to three months.


SuperSonics general manager Rick Sund revealed last month that
the seven-time All-Star would undergo season-ending surgery.


Allen averaged a career-high 26.4 points in 55 games despite
being bothered by ankle woes throughout the season.


On March 1, Allen said he would undergo a CT scan and possibly
miss the rest of the season. But three days later, he said he
would postpone surgery and scored 34 points on 13-of-25 shooting
in a 96-89 victory over Charlotte.


Allen played well until feeling discomfort on March 25 against
Portland, scoring 12 points on 4-of-19 shooting.
