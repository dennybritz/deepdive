Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said Sunday that he
hoped to return to work in two days after he was severely injured
in a road accident at the weekend.


"I am well but doctors have advised me 48-hours rest. I hope to
be back to work after that period," Mukherjee was quoted as
saying in a statement by the Press Trust of India.


The 71-year-old minister was flown to New Delhi Sunday after he
sustained head injuries when his car collided with a truck in
eastern state of West Bengal on Saturday.


"Mr. Mukherjee had a severe head injury after a stone-laden truck
hit his car last night from the opposite side," his political
secretary Badal Bhattacharya told AFP in West Bengal.


The minister was stable after getting twelve stitches to seal the
head wound.


The accident took place when a tyre of the truck -- which had
broken into the minister's high-security convoy -- burst and the
driver lost control, hitting the car.


The minister was headed back to state capital Kolkata with other
leaders of the ruling Congress party.


The driver of Mukherjee's car was seriously injured.


Congress workers said the minister had to be taken to hospital
with the help of residents.


Mukherjee is a veteran Congress leader who has held a host of
ministerial posts since the 1970s. Appointed defence minister in
2004, he took over foreign affairs in October last year.
