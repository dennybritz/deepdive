Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee was seriously injured
but out of danger after his car and a truck collided in the east
of the country, his secretary said Sunday.


"Mr Mukherjee had a severe head injury after a stone-laden truck
hit his car last night from the opposite side," Mukherjee's
political secretary Badal Bhattacharya told AFP.


The minister was stable after getting stitches to the head and
was to be flown to New Delhi later in the day, the secretary
said.


The accident took place when a tyre of the truck -- which had
broken into the minister's high-security convoy -- burst and the
driver lost control, hitting the car.


The accident occurred late Saturday near the village of
Nakashipara as the 71 -year-old Mukherjee was headed back to
state capital Kolkata with other leaders of the ruling Congress
party.


Mukherjee is a veteran Congress leader who has held a host of
ministerial posts since the 1970s. Appointed defence minister in
2004, he took over foreign affairs in October last year.
