Peter Manfredo Junior insisted he was not hurt and was stopped
prematurely in his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) super-
middleweight title challenge here on Saturday.


Welshman Joe Calzaghe made a 20th successful defence of his title
by stopping his American challenger -- who featured in reality
television show "The Contender -- after one minute and 30 seconds
of the third round.


"Of course it was premature," Manfredo told a news conference
late Saturday.


"Did you see my legs buckle? There was no warning. I was starting
to duck and hook, but it was suddenly waved off. I'm still in
shock that he stopped it."


He suggested that the referee "should be fined or something."


And Calzaghe seemed to agree that the fight had been stopped
early.


"I'm not the referee and I just do my job but it could have been
slightly premature," Calzaghe said.


"When you fight for the title you want to go down fighting. He
trained hard for this fight and I respect him for coming over
here to fight me."
