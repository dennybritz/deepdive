Six unarmed people were killed by troops in Indian Kashmir Sunday
as they attempted to cross a ceasefire border into the Pakistan
zone of the state, a military spokesman said.


"They were going from India to Pakistan in Ranbir Singh sector of
Jammu. The troops fired at them when they did stop despite a
warning," India's Border Security Force spokesman Prem Singh told
AFP.


Singh said the troops suspected the six were Islamic militants
but added that the victims had not yet been identified.


India says Islamic militants fighting an insurgency against New
Delhi's rule in Kashmir routinely use Pakistan as a base for
training and arms supplies.


Islamabad denies the charge and the two sides have engaged in a
slow-moving peace process since January 2004 to resolve disputes
over the region, the cause of two wars since independence for
both in 1947.


The 17-year-old Islamic separatist insurgency has so far left
more than 42,000 people dead by official count.
