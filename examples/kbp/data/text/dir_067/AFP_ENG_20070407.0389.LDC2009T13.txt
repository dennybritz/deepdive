Russian President Vladimir Putin returned Sunday a long-lost icon
of Our Lady of Vladimir to Russia's Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II
ahead of the Easter service in Moscow, vowing to bring back other
relics lost in the Soviet times.


"Let me hand over to you one of the spiritual relics now returned
to Russia, the icon of Our Lady of Vladimir," Putin said in
televised comments, voicing regret that "many valuables were
taken abroad in 1920s, 1930s and later and many of them lost."


"But we will determinedly, bit by bit gather all that can yet be
saved and returned to Russia, we will help the Russian Orthodox
Church to restore churches and monasteries," the president said.


Alexy II in his turn thanked Putin for the return of "the
miraculous, much prayed-for icon."


Putin and Alexy also exchanged Easter eggs and wished each other
well on the holiday.


Though Russia is a secular state, Putin has declared himself a
believer and has been assiduous in observing the religious
calendar.


Other officials, including Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov, were
also present at the Easter service.
