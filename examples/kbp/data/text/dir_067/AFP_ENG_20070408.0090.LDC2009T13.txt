Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday began celebrating Easter mass as tens
of thousands of pilgrims filled St Peter's Square in a festive
mood on the holiest day of the Christian calendar.


The pope, whose gold vestments and mitre sparkled in the sun, led
a procession of cardinals and bishops across the square decked
out in thousands of springtime flowers to take his place on the
papal throne before St Peter's Basilica as Swiss Guards stood at
attention.


A fanfare accompanying the procession added to the joyous
atmosphere.


Easter celebrates the Resurrection of Christ after his
crucifixion on Good Friday. This year all Christians, regardless
of the calendar they follow, are celebrating Easter on the same
day.


After the mass, the leader of the world's 1.1 billion Catholics
was to deliver the traditional "urbi et orbi" (to the city and
the world) blessing, an occasion to speak out about conflicts and
ills besetting the planet.


Sixty-seven television stations around the world will carry the
address live.
