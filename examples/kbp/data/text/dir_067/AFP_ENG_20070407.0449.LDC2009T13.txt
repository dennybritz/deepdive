The death toll from the Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami
has risen to 39 and is likely to climb sharply in the next few
days, aid agency World Vision said Sunday.


World Vision spokesman Martin Thomas said the latest toll was
based on information collated on Thursday, three days after
Monday's tsunami, and would rise as reports filter back from
remote islands in the Pacific archipelago.


"It's difficult to be sure of the numbers because the teams are
still out there collecting information," he told AFP in Gizo, one
of the worst-hit towns that is now the base for international
relief efforts.


"They're finding freshly-dug graves when they go into villages
but because of the situation they're not in a position to carry
out a census."


At least 39 people were killed, 6,000 others left homeless and
living in makeshift camps and 1,000 homes destroyed in Monday's
8.0-magnitude earthquake and the subsequent tsunami, Thomas said.


"The figures will rise when we gather all the information and
complete the picture and we're in the process of doing that now,"
he said.
