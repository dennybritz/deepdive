South Korean K.J. Choi suffered a frustrating run of three bogeys
in a row to begin the back nine but still fired a two-over par 74
here Saturday in the third round of the Masters.


Choi battled cold and windy conditions to stand on eight-over 224
after 54 holes in the year's first major championship here at
Augusta National Golf Club.


The Asian strongman, third at the Masters in 2004, produced his
best score of the week after a pair of opening 75s but was still
disappointed in a round of three birdies at five bogeys in his
fifth Masters appearance.


"I'm not happy as I bogeyed 10, 11 and 12," Choi said. I was
hitting the ball good but it was too windy. But in the last seven
holes, I played nicely. My goal today was to hit even or under
par."


Choi opened with a bogey but answered with birdies on the second
and third before another bogey at the fifth before his back-nine
struggles over the firm and fast Augusta National greens.


Choi missed three putts from inside four feet in succession but
bounced back at the 13th hole, a par-5, when he spun a wedge to a
foot of the flag for an easy birdie.


"With the wind blowing the way it is, the greens are drying up
fast. It's very tough out there," Choi said.


"I think I have a chance to aim for a top-10. The scores are
going up. The back nine is playing very hard and it's so hard to
control you iron shots. I'm going to have a good rest tonight and
spend time practising on my putting.


"I think I can play well tomorrow. I'm feeling good."
