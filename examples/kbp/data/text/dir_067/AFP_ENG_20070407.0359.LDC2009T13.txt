Enzo Maccarinelli defended his WBO cruiserweight title with a
second successive first-round stoppage by halting Bobby Gunn
after two minutes and 35 seconds at the Millennium Stadium on
Saturday.


The Welshman went straight to work and after a minute his
powerful jab had opened up a cut across the bridge of Canadian
Gunn's nose.


Maccarinelli, who inherited the world title after Sheffield's
Johnny Nelson relinquished it due to injury last year, flattened
Englishman Mark Hobson after just 71 seconds in his last fight.


Gunn last longer, but only just. Gunn, 33, gave away a huge
height advantage and just could not contend with the Welshman's
power.


Gunn was hurt by a straight left before two clubbing rights left
him dazed and prompted the referee to jump in and give a count.


He was allowed to continue on wobbly legs but Maccarinelli seized
his moment and after another clubbing right the fight was
stopped.
