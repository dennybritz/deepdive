Malaysian police will be made to explain a 40 percent surge in
crime this year in capital Kuala Lumpur, with fears it will
undermine a drive to boost tourism, reports said Sunday.


Deputy Internal Security Minister Johari Baharum said he wanted
an explanation for the rising rate in the first three months of
the year, which coincides with the start of a campaign to attract
more visitors.


Malaysia is aiming to boost tourist arrivals to 20.1 million in
2007 up from some 17.5 million last year.


"We are very concerned about the increase in crime. I have been
informed that over the last three months, there has been a 40
percent increase in crime in Kuala Lumpur," Johari was quoted as
saying in the Star daily.


The minister said crimes on the rise include bag snatch thefts,
gambling and vice activities including prostitution.


"This year is Visit Malaysia Year and we do not want the problem
to smear the country's image," he was quoted as saying by the
Bernama news agency.


The Malaysian government has been battling a soaring crime rate
amidst criticism that the country's poorly-paid police force is
inept and corrupt.


According to official statistics, the number of criminal
incidents jumped 45.1 percent from 2003 to 2006, with 232,620
criminal cases recorded last year.
