South Africa's national carrier may stop serving meals on
domestic flights, reduce cabin crew numbers and shelve plans for
more international routes as part of a rescue plan, a report said
Sunday.


The package of proposals to save 2.7 billion rand (378 million
dollars) is contained in a report by a firm of troubleshooters
which is to go before the South African Airways (SAA) board next
month, according to the Sunday Times.


The government has long resisted calls for SAA's privatisation
but financial concerns are growing with the airline reportedly on
course to post a 652 million loss for 2006.


By ditching meals on domestic routes, the Seabury Airline
Planning Group said SAA could save 171 million rand. A further 60
million rand could be saved by limiting the number of flight
attendants and 80 million by scrapping in-house magazines and in-
flight entertainment guides.


The group is also recommending that SAA suspend non-profitable
routes and shelve plans to run new services to Munich, Germany;
Chicago; Buenos Aires; Libreville, Gabon; and Bamako, Mali.


A spokeswoman refused to comment until the board meeting.
