Roman Catholics, who comprise more than 90 percent of Poland's
population, marked Easter with fervour, staging processions and
attending Mass on Sunday to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.


Several thousand people staged a night procession with candles at
a 17th century shrine about 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of
Krakow where the late pope John Paul II used to pray as a child.


Thousands of others attended special night time prayers at a
Dominican church in Warsaw lasting for more than four hours
before staging a procession at 1:00 am (2300 GMT Saturday).


"Each year, the numbers are swelling. If this continues, we have
have to expand the building," said the priest of the Dominican
church, already one of Warsaw's biggest.


The devout also took their Easter lunch to be blessed in churches
in keeping with a local tradition, carrying colourful hampers of
eggs, bread and sausages.
