Maoist rebels shot dead two railway security troops and injured
another three in an attack on a passenger train in eastern India
early Sunday, police said.


The incident took place in eastern Bihar state's Jamui district,
about 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the state capital Patna.


The rebels killed another six people, including two paramilitary
soldiers, in an ambush late Friday night in neighbouring
Jharkhand state.


The Maoist insurgency began in India in the 1960s as an armed
peasant movement and has spread to 15 of the country's 29 states.


Last month, the guerrillas killed 55 policemen in eastern
Chhattisgarh state in one of their biggest attacks.
