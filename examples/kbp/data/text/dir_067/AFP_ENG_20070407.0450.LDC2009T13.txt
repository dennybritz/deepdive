Kyle Wellwood's third-period goal lifted the Toronto Maple Leafs
to a 6-5 victory on Saturday that extinguished the National
Hockey League playoff hopes of the Montreal Canadiens.


Wellwood's goal at 3:43 of the third period capped a furious
comeback for Toronto.


Defensemen Carlo Colaiacovo and Bryan McCabe also scored during
the uprising for Toronto, which climbed over Montreal and into
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.


However, the Maple Leafs still need the New York Islanders to be
held to less than two points by the New Jersey Devils on Sunday
in order to qualify for the postseason.


In a game that lived up to its billing, Toronto took a 3-1 lead
before Michael Ryder recorded a natural hat trick and set up
Chris Higgins for a tally to give Montreal a 5-3 advantage.


It was the second career three-goal effort by Ryder, whose
tallies came in a 5:49 span early in the second period.


But Colaiacovo scored late in the session and McCabe forged a 5-5
tie with a power-play goal 58 seconds into the third.


Less than three minutes later, defenseman Tomas Kaberle unleashed
a shot from the blue line that deflected off Wellwood in front
and past goaltender Cristobal Huet, putting the Maple Leafs ahead
for good.


Captain Mats Sundin collected three assists and Kaberle set up
two tallies for Toronto.


Saku Koivu had three assists for the Canadiens, who had won seven
of their previous nine games.
