A soldier from the NATO-led force was killed Sunday and another
was injured in a roadside bomb blast in southern Afghanistan, the
alliance said.


The death brought to 28 the number of NATO-led troops killed this
year in violence-plagued southern Afghanistan, said a NATO
military spokeswoman, Lieutenant Colonel Maria Carl said.


She did not reveal the location or the nationality of the
casualties.


"There was an improvised explosive device (IED) explosion this
morning, killing one (NATO) soldier and injuring another one,"
she told a news briefing in Kabul.
