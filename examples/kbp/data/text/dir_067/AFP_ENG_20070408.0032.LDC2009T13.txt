Japan completed a 5-0 whitewash of Thailand on Sunday without
their ace Takao Suzuki, who rested after helping his squad
securing a spot in the play-off for the top-level Davis Cup World
Group.


Suzuki teamed up with Satoshi Iwabuchi on Saturday to beat Thai
twin brothers Sonchat and Sanchai Ratiwatana 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4,
giving Japan an insurmountable 3-0 lead.


On Sunday, Go Soeda whipped Weerapat Doakmaiklee 6-1, 6-2 in a
shortened dead rubber and Suzuki's substitute Yuichi Sugita
breezed past Kittipong Wachiramanowong 6-2, 6-4 to finish out the
decisive win.


Sugita, ranked only 475th in the world, hit four aces and needed
only 65 minutes to dispose of the 1,507th-ranked Kittipong.


Thailand were without their top two players -- 2002 Asian Games
gold medallist Paradorn Srichaphan and 2006 champion Danai
Udomchoke -- who are both sidelined due to injuries.


Japan stretched their record to six wins and two defeats against
Thailand in the Davis Cup series since their first encounter in
1958.


The winners of the Asia-Oceania Zone Group One second round tie
now advance to play for a place in the World Group next year.
