Chinese President Hu Jintao urged the newly elected leader of
Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Party on Sunday to work with
China for better cross- strait relations, state press said.


In a message in his capacity as head of China's ruling Communist
Party, Hu congratulated Wu Poh-hsiung for his election win
Saturday, Xinhua news agency reported.


"I sincerely hope that the KMT and the CPC (Communist Party) will
work together for the well-being of compatriots on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits," it quoted Hu as saying.


We should "continue to promote the peaceful and steady
development of cross- strait relations and join hands to create a
bright future for the Chinese nation."


Wu, a former interior minister, won the election after former KMT
chairman Ma Ying-jeou resigned over an indictment for corruption.


The mainland communists ousted the KMT from China following a
bitterly fought civil war that ended in 1949.


Since then Taiwan has been ruled independently, despite mainland
insistence that the island is a part of China's sovereignty
awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.


Since the KMT lost its rule over Taiwan for the first time in
2000, Beijing has sought to work with the party to contain the
independence ambitions of President Chen Shui-bian's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.


The KMT has opposed formal and declared independence for Taiwan.
