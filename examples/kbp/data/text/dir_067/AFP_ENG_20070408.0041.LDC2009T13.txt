Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee was seriously injured
but out of danger after his car collided with a truck in the east
of the country, his secretary said Sunday.


"Mr Mukherjee had a severe head injury after a stone-laden truck
hit his car last night from the opposite side," his political
secretary Badal Bhattacharya told AFP.


The minister was stable after getting twelve stitches to the
head.


He was on his way to New Delhi by a special plane, officials of
his Congress party said.


"He is stable. He even spoke to people visiting him," Congress
leader Pradip Bhattacharaya said.


The accident took place when a tyre of the truck -- which had
broken into the minister's high-security convoy -- burst and the
driver lost control, hitting the car.


The accident occurred late Saturday as the 71-year-old Mukherjee
was headed back to state capital Kolkata with other leaders of
the ruling Congress party.


The driver of Mukherjee's car was seriously injured.


Congress workers said the minister had to be taken to hospital
with the help of residents.


Mukherjee is a veteran Congress leader who has held a host of
ministerial posts since the 1970s. Appointed defence minister in
2004, he took over foreign affairs in October last year.
