The Buffalo Sabres posted a 2-0 win over Washington, setting a
club record with their 53rd win of the season and clinching the
Presidents' Trophy for the best record in the regular season.


Buffalo also secured home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs.


Despite being tied with the Detroit Red Wings (50-19-13) with 113
points and having one game remaining, the Sabres won the trophy
by virtue of having recorded more wins.


Detroit was vying for its third straight Presidents' Trophy and
fourth in five National Hockey League seasons.


With the triumph, the Sabres (53-21-7) also matched the team mark
for points in a season, which was established in 1974-75.


Buffalo can eclipse the total by earning a point Sunday at
Philadelphia.
