Some 3,000 people staged a march in Rome on Sunday to press upon
the Italian government to push the United Nations to declare a
universal moratorium on the death penalty.


The marchers, who were due to end their procession at Saint
Peter's Square just about the time Pope Benedict XVI was due to
deliver his traditional Easter address, held placards saying "We
are against," and "We want a UN moratorium soon."


The march was organised by Marco Panella and Emma Bonino, who
lead the small Radical party, as well as the Roman Catholic
Sant'Egidio Community.


"Everybody agrees (that the death penalty should be abolished)
but nobody does anything," said Panella.


Bonino, a former EU commissioner who doubles up as the external
trade minister, added: "We are here to back the government
initiative to get the UN General Assembly to adopt a resolution
on the moratorium."


The Italian government had said in January, when it became a
member of the UN Security Council, that it would use its tenure
to get such a resolution passed but has not forwarded any such
proposal yet.
