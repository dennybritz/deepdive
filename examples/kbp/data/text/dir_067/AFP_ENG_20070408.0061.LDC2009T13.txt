China's state prosecutors have filed charges against the nation's
former top drugs official for taking bribes amounting to five
million yuan (650,000 dollars), state press said Sunday.


Zheng Xiaoyu, former director of the State Food and Drug
Administration, was accused of taking cash bribes and gifts from
pharmaceutical companies in exchange for granting drug approvals,
Xinhua news agency said.


Zheng's relatives were also being investigated for being in
possession of millions of yuan in assets that they could not
account for, the report said.


Zheng was booted from the ruling Communist Party last month in
the scandal that came to light after a series of deaths and
health scares linked to poor quality medicines, including an
officially approved antibiotic that cost the lives of at least 10
people last year.


The antibiotic Xinfu has since been taken off the market.


Xinhua said that officials of the Hainan Kongliyuan Group had
also been detained for allegedly offering Zheng bribes in
exchange for 277 drug approvals.


Most of the medicines were antibiotics which could bring the
company high profits, it said.


Zheng, who retired as head of the administration nearly two years
ago, has also been implicated in a separate graft investigation.


Zheng ran the food and administration from its inception in 1998
until he stepped down in 2005.
