New Jersey's Vince Carter and Jason Kidd became the first NBA
teammates in 18 years to record  triple-doubles in the same game
as the Nets posted a dramatic overtime triumph over Washington.


The two stars became the first teammates to accomplish the feat
since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen for Chicago on January 3,
1989 against the Los Angeles Clippers.


Carter collected a season-high tying 46 points, a career-high 16
rebounds and 10 assists, and Kidd had 10 points, a season-best 16
rebounds and tied a season high with 18 assists in the 120-114
victory over the injury depleted Wizards.


But with All-Stars Gilbert Arenas and Caron Butler sidelined,
Antawn Jamison came up big for Washington - nailing an off-
balance 3-pointer with one second left in regulation to tie the
game 104-104. He had a season-high 37 points.


On the ensuing possession, Kidd's errant lob pass to Carter went
off the rim as time expired. New Jersey then scored the first
eight points of the extra period, outscoring Washington 16-10
overall to secure the victory.


The victory couldn't have come at a better time for the Nets, who
improved to 36-40 and are one game ahead of Orlando for the
seventh spot in the Eastern Conference with six games to play.


Jarvis Hayes also netted a season-high 29 points for the Wizards,
who have lost seven of their last nine games to fall three behind
Miami for the top spot in the Southeast Division.
