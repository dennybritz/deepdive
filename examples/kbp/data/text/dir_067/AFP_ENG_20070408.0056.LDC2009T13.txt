Sri Lanka cricketer Russel Arnold's brother-in-law was run over
by a train as he spoke on a mobile phone while walking on a
railway track, police said Sunday.


Stephen Shanmugam was hit by a train in Colombo on Saturday,
police said, adding that an investigation was under way.


With Sri Lanka scheduled to play their next World Cup game in
Grenada on Thursday, Arnold is unlikely to return home for the
funeral, a family friend said.
