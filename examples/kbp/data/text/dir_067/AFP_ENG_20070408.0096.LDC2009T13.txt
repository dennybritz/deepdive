South Korea's plant exports surged 43 percent to 8.98 billion
dollars in the first quarter to March, thanks to the Middle East
construction boom, data showed Sunday.


Orders from the Middle East rose threefold year-on-year to 5.41
billion dollars, 60 percent of the total, according to the
government data carried by Yonhap news agency.


The orders were mainly for building petrochemical plants, power
stations and desalination facilities in the oil-rich region, the
figures showed.


South Korea secured orders worth 1.75 billion dollars in Europe,
1.12 billion dollars in Asia, 517 million dollars in America and
180 million dollars in Africa during the first quarter.


South Korean builders clinched overseas plant orders worth 25.4
billion dollars in 2006, up 60.6 percent from the previous year.
