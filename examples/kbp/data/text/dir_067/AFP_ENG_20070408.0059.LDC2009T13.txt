Three Iranians convicted of kidnapping and then raping a woman
were hanged on Sunday in the central town of Arak, the state-run
IRNA news agency reported.


Bahram Salehi, Mohammad Reza Salehi and Majid Hossein-Abadi
abducted the woman while she was with her fiance before raping
her.


The hangings bring to at least 42 the number of executions in
Iran this year. At least 154 people were executed in 2006,
according to an AFP tally based on press and witness reports.


Capital offences in the Islamic republic include murder, rape,
armed robbery, apostasy, blasphemy, serious drug trafficking,
repeated sodomy, adultery or prostitution, treason and espionage.
