The Champ Car motor racintg series Saturday announced their race
scheduled for Zolder on September 9 has been moved up to august
26.


The inaugural Champ Car Grand Prix of Belgium will be followed by
a race in the Netherlands, which will take place September 2 at
Assen.


"The Zolder date was moved to ease concerns that the FIA
(International Automobile Federation) had about our race  being
too close to a Formula One event at Spa on September 16, and we
want to give the open-wheel fans of the region every opportunity
to attend both races if they so desire." said John Clagett, Champ
Car Executive Vice-President of Planning and Development.


The 16-race Champ Car World Series season starts Sunday with the
Vegas Grand Prix.


The series is slated to visit six new venues this year, including
one in China.


Champ Car officials are still working with promoters and the FIA
to finalize their China race date for 2007 with a final
announcement expected in the coming weeks.
