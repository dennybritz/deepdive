A newspaper poll of Britons' views of Prime Minister Tony Blair's
ten years in power painted an unflattering picture of his
premiership Sunday, with 57 percent saying he has stayed in
office too long.


According to the Observer newspaper, many people now believe the
country is more dangerous, less happy and less pleasant than it
was in the pre-Blair era.


Some 61 percent disagreed that it is now more pleasant than in
1997, when a fresh-faced Blair won his first election victory.


A further 69 percent thought it was more dangerous and 58 percent
disagreed it was happier.


There was some cheer for Blair, though -- 51 percent thought
Britain had become a better place for ethnic minorities under his
leadership, while 61 percent said the situation for homosexuals
had improved.


The findings seem to dash the hopes of Blair's advisors --
outlined in a memo leaked last year -- that he should "go with
the crowds wanting more."


"He should be the star who won't even play that last encore," the
document added.


Blair has said he will step down as prime minister before
September.


His final months in office have been dogged by a police
investigation into allegations of impropriety over party funding
-- the "cash for honours" probe -- and wrangles over who should
take over from him.


Finance minister Gordon Brown is favourite but faces bitter
opposition from elements loyal to Blair within the ruling Labour
Party.


The BPIX poll of 2,034 adults was conducted from March 16-19.
