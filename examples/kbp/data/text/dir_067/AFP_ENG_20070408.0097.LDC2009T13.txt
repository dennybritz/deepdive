Ninety-two people suffered carbon monoxide poisoning from a
faulty heater in a hotel in Lons, in southwest France, firemen
said Sunday.


Fifteen people were taken to hospital, of whom three were said to
be in serious condition.


Firemen said the toxic gas, which is odourless and invisible,
"must have spread through the corridors and bedrooms" of the
Premiere Classe hotel on a main road in this town near Pau early
Sunday.


Around 6,000 people suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning every
year in France, of whom 300 die, most of them at home.
