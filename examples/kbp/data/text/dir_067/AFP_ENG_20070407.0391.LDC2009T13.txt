A Sunni insurgent group has claimed responsibility for a deadly
roadside bomb attack on a British patrol this week in southern
Iraq, according to a message posted Saturday on a militant
website.


The Mujahedeen Army, or Jaish al-Mujahedeen, said it was
responsible for planting the explosives that killed four British
servicemen and their Kuwaiti interpreter on April 5, said the US-
based SITE Institute, which monitors Islamist sites.


The group set up an ambush in the early morning hours against the
British patrol, planting an improvised explosive device near the
southern city of Basra which detonated as a British armored
vehicle approached the area, it said.


The explosion "led to its complete destruction and the death of
those who were in it," and was followed by an exchange of fire
"which led to the injury of several British soldiers," it said.


The British military said earlier this week that the four
soldiers and civilian translator travelling in the same vehicle
were killed outside Basra in a complex roadside bomb, small-arms
fire and rocket-propelled grenade attack.


Jaish al-Mujahedeen first emerged in February 2005 when it
claimed the abduction of two Indonesian journalists, who were
freed after nearly a week in captivity.


It has since taken credit for several attacks in Iraq, including
shooting down a US Blackhawk helicopter in February.
