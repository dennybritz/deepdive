A gunman shot dead nine Philippine soldiers in a rampage at a
military base on the troubled island of Jolo before he was also
killed, sources said on Sunday.


It was not clear whether the shooter was a soldier or a member of
a pro- government militia helping troops in the hunt against Al
Qaeda-linked Islamic militants on Jolo, they said.


The man ran amok and started firing indiscriminately some time on
Saturday morning before he was killed by troops, the sources
said.


Military officials declined to issue an official comment but
sources confirmed the incident to AFP and said it was now under
investigation.


Over 5,000 troops backed by US advisers are on Jolo island to
track down Abu Sayyaf militants and several key leaders of Jemaah
Islamiyah, militant groups which have been blamed for a number of
terror atrocities.
