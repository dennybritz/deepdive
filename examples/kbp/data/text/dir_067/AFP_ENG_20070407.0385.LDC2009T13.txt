The International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Chris Broad
rubbed salt in South Africa's wounds by handing them a fine for a
slow over-rate fine during their 67-run defeat against Bangladesh
here Saturday.


"Chris Broad imposed the fines after Graeme Smith's side was
ruled to be one over short of its target at the scheduled finish
of the Bangladesh innings when time allowances were taken into
consideration," said a ICC statement.


"In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing
over-rate penalties, players are fined five per cent of their
match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the
allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.


"As such, Smith has been fined 10 per cent of his match fee while
his players have each received five per cent fines."


The Bangladesh defeat left South Africa on four points from as
many matches and still must face England, West Indies and New
Zealand.


They need to win all their remaining matches to be in contention
for a place in the semi-finals.


India, Pakistan and the West Indies were the other sides who have
been fined for slow over-rates in the tournament.
