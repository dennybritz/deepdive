KDDI Corp. will become the first Japanese mobile carrier to start
its brand in the US market by renting a network from a US
company, reports said Sunday.


Japan's second-largest mobile provider will offer the service
under the name "KDDI Mobile" by renting a wireless communications
network from Sprint Nextel, Kyodo News said, quoting company
officials.


KDDI plans to target Japanese customers in the United States by
offering Japanese-language data input, as well as display and
ring melodies familiar to them, it said.


The service could be running as early as June, the Asahi Shimbun
newspaper said.


Japan's largest mobile phone service provider NTT DoCoMo Inc. has
also been expanding overseas, mostly by licensing agreements for
its popular "i-mode" Internet-capable mobile phone service.


NTT DoCoMo has also made capital investments in European and US
telecom firms, but has scrapped most of them after losses.


KDDI's overseas expansion comes amid growing competition at home
since October, when Japan began allowing mobile subscribers to
switch carriers without changing their numbers.


Immediate confirmation of the report was not available.
