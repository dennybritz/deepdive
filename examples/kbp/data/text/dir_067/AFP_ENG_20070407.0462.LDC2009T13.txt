Retired Chicago Bulls star Luc Longley saved his family from the
blaze which gutted his Australian home and destroyed much of his
NBA memorabilia, reports said Sunday.


No one was hurt in the fire which broke out in his 2 million
dollar (1.6 million US) converted warehouse in the Australian
town of Freemantle early Saturday.


"I was asleep and heard a bang, an explosion, and it was already
on fire and got the kids out," he told Australian television.


Longley said he was unconcerned about collectibles from his time
with the NBA and as a three-time Olympian for Australia.


"I don't care about that stuff -- I've got all that in my head,"
he said.


"It's more the photos of the kids and stuff like that. No one's
hurt. It's not a tragedy -- it's just a bummer."


Longley's uncle said the NBA star who played alongside Michael
Jordan, was "cut up" at how close he came to losing his family.


"They were all fast asleep but something has gone off, exploded,
which woke Luc up," John Longley told The Sun-Herald.


"From that moment, he had just enough time to get everyone up and
out."


Investigators said the fire was likely triggered by an electrical
fault and was not being treated as suspicious.


Longley, 38, retired in 2001.
