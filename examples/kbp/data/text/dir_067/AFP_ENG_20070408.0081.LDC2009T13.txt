US forces captured a leading Al-Qaeda militant on Sunday whom
they hold responsible for a wave of deadly car bombings in the
capital, the military said in a statement.


It did not name the suspect but said he was a close aide of Al-
Qaeda's Baghdad commander.


A US military spokesman told AFP the captured militant acted as a
point man for the Al-Qaeda commander.


He was a "gatekeeper, somebody through whom you needed to go to
meet the leader," he said.


The military statement said the captured militant had ties to
several senior Al- Qaeda figures and was suspected of involvement
in a series of deadly vehicle bombings in the capital.


It said he was detained along with two other known Al-Qaeda
militants.
