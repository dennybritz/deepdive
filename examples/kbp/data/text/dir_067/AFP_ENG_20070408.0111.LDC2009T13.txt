Nigeria's electoral agency's final list of those eligible to
contest elections this month has excluded vice president Atiku
Abubakar whose legal challenge is pending at the Supreme Court.


The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday
published what it called its final list of approved contestants
for the poll, newspapers reported on their front pages on Sunday.


State governorship and parliamentary polls are slated for April
14 while presidential and National Assembly elections are fixed
for April 21.


The INEC has barred Abubakar, President Olusegun Obasanjo's
deputy since the return of democratic rule in May 1999, after he
was indicted of corruption.


Since then, Abubakar, 60, a former senior customs officer, has
been battling in several courts to get his name cleared and
inserted in the electoral list.


He is the candidate of the Alliance for Democracy (AC), one of
the two main challengers to the ruling Peoples Democractic Party
(PDP) in the elections.


The Supreme Court is expected to give its ruling shortly on
Abubakar's suit challenging a decision of an Abuja Federal
Appeals court which last week supported INEC's disqualification
of the politician's candidature.


Adressing a political rally Saturday in Lagos, Abubakar boasted
to his supporters that he had not been disqualified and that only
"Nigerian voters can disqualify me."
