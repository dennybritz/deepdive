A businessman has declared he is alive after hundreds of posters
were circulated across Malaysian to announce prayers for his
death, reports said Sunday.


Arumugam Vellayan said he heard about the posters -- which were
put up on shop walls and around markets in Kuala Lumpur, and sent
to relatives in two other Malaysian states -- after receiving
phone calls during the week to check on him.


"My phone has been ringing non-stop with friends calling to find
out if I am still alive. It has distressed by family," Arumugam
was quoted as saying in the Star daily.


"I want everyone know to know that I'm still alive," he added.


Arumugam received 460 of the posters in the mail Friday which
were addressed to his business contacts, and which were sent from
one of his own businesses, according to reports.


They were marked "return to sender" because of insufficient
postage.


Reports showed Arumugam posing with one of the anonymously
circulated posters, which shows a photo of him with his eyes
closed and invites people for special prayers for his soul on
Sunday evening.


"All friends are invited to attend the prayers," it reads.


Arumugam, who owns two restaurants and also heads a newspaper
vendors' association, said he feared for his life and his
family's.


"I take this as a death threat," said Arumugam. "I don't know who
did this, I suspect it might be business rivalry."
