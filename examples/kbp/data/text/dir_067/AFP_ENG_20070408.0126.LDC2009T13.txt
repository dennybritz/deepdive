Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday expressed "apprehension" over the
plight of Africans in several parts of the world's poorest
continent, notably Zimbabwe, Darfur and Somalia.


"I look with apprehension at the conditions prevailing in several
regions of Africa," he said in his traditional "Urbi et Orbi" (to
the city and the world) blessing from the loggia of St Peter's
Basilica.


"Zimbabwe is in the grip of a grievous crisis, and for this
reason the bishops of that country in a recent document indicated
prayer and a shared commitment for the common good as the only
way forward," he said.
