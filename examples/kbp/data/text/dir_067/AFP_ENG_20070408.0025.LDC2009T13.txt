Sri Lankan troops and police have stepped up security over fears
of more bomb attacks before the traditional Sinhala and Tamil New
Year festivities this week, officials said Sunday.


Sniffer dogs were deployed at main bus stations to guard against
explosives being planted following a parcel bomb attack last week
aboard a bus in which 17 people were killed and 25 wounded in the
eastern district of Ampara.


A road side bomb targeted another civilian bus in the northern
district of Vavuniya Saturday, killing eight people and wounding
25, according to police and hospital authorities.


The blasts come ahead of the April 14 New Year celebrations.


The government blamed both attacks on the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who denied any involvement and in turn accused
the military of staging the attacks to "discredit" them.


Tamil Tigers have waged a 35-year campaign for independence that
has claimed over 60,000 lives in Sri Lanka.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
