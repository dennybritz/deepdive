The British military on Sunday handed over a key base in the
southern Iraqi city of Basra to the Iraqi army as part of its
gradual withdrawal plans from the war- torn country.


The military transferred the Shatt al-Arab Hotel base, one of
five occupied by the British military since the March 2003 US-led
invasion, to the 10th Iraqi Army division.


Major General Habib Taleb, of the 10th division, said at a
ceremony marking the handover that Iraqi forces will soon take
over other bases in and around Basra from the British military.


"Iraqi forces have moved into the Shatt al-Arab base and British
troops are moving out as we speak," British Lieutenant Colonel
Kevin Stratford-Wright said by telephone from Basra.


"The Shatt al-Arab base in now entirely manned by Iraqi forces."


Last month the military handed over a base at the Old State
Building to Iraqi forces.


The military further plans to transfer security at the Al-Shaiba
base later this month, Stratford-Wright said, adding that a
fourth base at Basra palace is expected to be transferred by late
summer.


But plans to hand over the main Basra airport base are not
finalised yet, he said.


In February, British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that the
number of British troops would be cut from 7,100 to 5,500 by the
middle of this year.


But Britain's The Sunday Telegraph, quoting a confidential
planning document, reported that the troops could be serving in
Iraq until as late as 2012.
