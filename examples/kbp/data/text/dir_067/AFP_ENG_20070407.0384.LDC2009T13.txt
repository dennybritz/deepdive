Joe Calzaghe gave Peter Manfredo a quick and painful lesson in
the reality of world title boxing at the Millennium Stadium here
on Saturday.


In a commanding 20th defence of his WBO super-middleweight title,
the Welshman forced a third round stoppage of American Manfredo,
who was star of 'The Contender' television series two years ago.


Calzaghe, 35, has been world champion for ten years and the
outcome was never in doubt as he gave the 35,000 fans the result
they wanted.


After a messy opening round, southpaw Calzaghe took control in
the second behind his jab before unloading two-fisted
combinations in the third.


Calzaghe - unbeaten now in 43 fights - then let go with a
ferocious two-fisted combination to Manfredo's head, which caused
the American to almost slip over the ropes and out of the ring.


With no punches coming back, the fight was stopped after one
minute and 30 seconds despite Manfredo pleading he was OK to
continue. Manfredo slipped to four defeats  in 30 fights.


Manfredo, 26, complained referee Terry O'Connor jumped in too
soon since he was never put down by Calzaghe.
