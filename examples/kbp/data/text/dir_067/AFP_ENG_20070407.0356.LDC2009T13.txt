Bob and Mike Bryan defeated Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco
7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) on Saturday to give the United States a
place in the Davis Cup World Group semi-finals.


The doubles victory gave the Americans an unassailable 3-0 lead
over Spain - playing without world No. 2 Rafael Nadal - in the
best-of-five match tie.


The American pair won their 11th Davis Cup match out of 12 to
send the 31-time champion Americans into a September 21-23 tie
against Sweden.


The victory marked the 155th win for the US from a 2-0 lead,
which was achieved on Friday when James Blake and Andy Roddick
both won in singles.
