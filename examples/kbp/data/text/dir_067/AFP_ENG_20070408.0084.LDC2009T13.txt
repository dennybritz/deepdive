A series of attacks in and around Baghdad on Sunday killed at
least 20 people and wounded dozens, security officials said.


In the deadliest attack, at least 15 people were killed and 25
wounded when a rocket slammed into a residential building in the
town of Mahmudiyah, south of the capital, a security official
said.


The building was located on the main street in the centre of
Mahmudiyah, a majority Shiite town, the official said.


Another four people were killed and six wounded in a car bomb
attack in Baghdad's mixed Shiite-Sunni district of Al-Alam.


A policeman was killed and another two wounded when a roadside
bomb exploded against their patrol in the Sunni district of
Adhamiyah.


Insurgents have managed to carry out attacks in Baghdad despite a
massive security operation since February 14 to quell daily
bloodshed in the Iraqi capital that has left thousands dead in
the last year alone.
