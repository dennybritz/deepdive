The ashes of 11 people were scattered off a small island a mile
from downtown Hong Kong as a new burial-at-sea scheme went into
operation in the space-scarce city, the government said Sunday.


Family members and religious ministers took to the high seas
aboard a specially decked out boat for the burials Saturday
afternoon.


Each deceased was given a religious send-off of their family's
choosing before their ashes were tossed over the side, a
government spokesman said.


The government gave the go-ahead for burials at specific sites
around the southern Chinese territory's coast last year in a bid
to ease competition for burial space in Hong Kong's choked
cemeteries and crematoria.


One mourner told the Sunday Morning Post newspaper: "My brother
loved his freedom... scattering his ashes at sea can finally give
him his freedom."


The government said that as well as a solution to the lack of
burial space, sea burials were also cheaper and better for the
environmment.
