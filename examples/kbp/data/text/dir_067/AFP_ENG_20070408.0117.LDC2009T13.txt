Former World Cup winner Diego Maradona is due to leave hospital
next week after 10 days of treatment for excessive alcohol
consumption, a medical source said.


The 46-year-old was admitted to hospital on March 28 after
suffering a decompensation, the result of too much drinking.


"If all goes well he will be out next week," said Hector
Pezzella, the director of the hospital where Maradona is staying.


Pezzella said the former star of Argentine football, whose famous
'Hand of God' goal helped defeat England in the quarter-finals of
the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, will need to rest and recuperate
when he leaves.


"The most important day will be the day he leaves. He needs to
realise that he needs to follow treatment for his problem (with
alcohol)."


It was not the first time Maradona, who used to play for
Barcelona and Napoli in Europe, has been hospitalised due to his
excessive lifestyle.


In 2000 he was admitted to hospital in Uruguay after suffering
from a heart problem related to excessive drug consumption.


Four years later he was back in hospital after a cardio-vascular
problem.


And last year, when seriously overweight, he had his stomach
stabled to try to limit the amount of food and drink he could
consume.
