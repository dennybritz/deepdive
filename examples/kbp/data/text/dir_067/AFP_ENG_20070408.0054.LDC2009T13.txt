Four Pakistani paramilitary soldiers were injured Sunday when
bombs exploded near their vehicles in northwest Pakistan,
officials said.


A remote-controlled bomb exploded on a roadside near a
paramilitary contingent outside the tribal town of Tank, local
police official Abdullah said.


The blast injured two paramilitary soldiers and damaged their
vehicle, he said.


In a second incident a remote-controlled roadside bomb near the
town of Bannu exploded when paramilitary soldiers were patrolling
the area, a security official said. Two soldiers were injured.


Bannu and Tank border the restive Waziristan tribal district
where 250 people, mostly Uzbek and Chechan fighters, have been
killed in the past three weeks.


In Parachinar, another Pakistani tribal area, fierce sectarian
clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims since Friday have left
40 people dead. Authorities have deployed troops and imposed a
curfew in Parachinar to try to control the violence.


Pakistan has deployed some 80,000 troops in its tribal areas
bordering Afghanistan to check the movement of Taliban and Al-
Qaeda linked militants who launch attacks on foreign troops in
Afghanistan.
