Iran said on Sunday all flights over its territory require prior
authorisation, after reports it refused permission to Iraqi Prime
Minister Nuri al-Maliki's plane to fly over the Islamic republic.


"It is a technical question and for all the flights there has to
be a request to obtain authorisation," foreign ministry spokesman
Mohammad Ali Hosseini said, without explicitly confirming that
Iran had not allowed the plane to fly over its territory.


Maliki's arrival on a visit Tokyo was delayed Sunday amid reports
Iran refused to allow his plane to fly across its airspace,
Japanese officials said.
