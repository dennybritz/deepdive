The US House of Representatives voted for the first time Friday
to link funding for the Iraq war to a timetable for a withdrawal
of combat troops by August 31, 2008, defying a veto threat from
President George W. Bush.


In the latest tense drama in the escalating tussle between
Congress and Bush over Iraq, lawmakers voted 218 to 212 to
approve a 124-billion-dollar war budget, which includes the
withdrawal deadline, inserted by Democrats.
