Juventus president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli said on Friday he was
confident goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon would stay with the second
division leaders.


On Thursday Buffon said it would be hard for him not to follow
Marcello Lippi if the former Italy coach - who resigned after
leading the Azzurri to triumph at the 2006 World Cup - returned
from his sabatical to take charge of another Italian club.


But Cobolli Gigli insisted Buffon, whose relationship with Lippi
is very close having also worked with him when he was Juventus
coach, would remain loyal to the Turin club.


"Buffon will stay with us, 100 per cent," he said.


"I read what Buffon said. He was merely expressing his admiration
for Lippi for winning the World Cup, an admiration we all share.


"But I'm not worried about it. My only concern is making sure
Juve return to Serie A."


Buffon, 26, joined Juventus from Parma in 2001 for 50 million
euros (67 million dollars), which was and still is the highest
fee ever paid for a goalkeeper.


His current contract, which reportedly earns him five million
euros (6.6 million dollars) a year, expires in July 2010.


Last summer Juventus were relegated from Serie A and given a
nine-point penalty in Serie B for their role in the Italian
match-fixing scandal.


Their demotion led to the departure of many of their star
players, but Buffon, together with fellow Italy international
Alessandro Del Piero, France international David Trezeguet and
Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved decided to stay.
