Russian liberals should resist foreign influence and
revolutionary ideals, the Kremlin's chief ideologue said in a
speech published on Friday ahead of a key election season in
Russia.


"It should be remembered that revolutions are above all a waste
of human life, above all destruction, above all ruin," Vladislav
Surkov, a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin, said in the
Vremya Novostei daily.


As a result of revolutions "usually maniacs and terrorists come
to power," Surkov said, using rhetoric that has become
increasingly common among Russian officials since a pro-Western
popular uprising in neighbouring Ukraine in 2004.


"Don't try to make your native country happy with the help of
foreign governments.... Democracy is the power of our people in
our own country," Surkov said in the speech to Russian students.


Surkov drew parallels between a February 1917 revolution led by
liberal Russian politicians that toppled Tsar Nicholas II and the
current activities of opposition political forces in Russia.


The Kremlin has stepped up warnings about the dangers of
revolutionary and radical ideas in Russia ahead of parliamentary
elections in December and a March 2008 vote to elect a successor
to Putin.
