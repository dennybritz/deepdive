Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday reiterated his pledge to
visiting Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi that Japan would
extend its air support mission to Iraq for another two years, a
report said.


"Iraq's stability is important to the peace in the Middle East as
well as to Japan's national interest. I will keep aid to Iraqi
reconstruction," Abe told Hashimi, who is on a four-day visit
here, Jiji press reported.


Abe also said he would submit a bill to extend the Japanese air
support mission for another two years before it expires in July,
repeating his remarks on Tuesday, it said.


Japan last year ended its historic deployment of troops on a
reconstruction mission to Iraq, but continues to provide
logistical air support to the US-led coalition and the United
Nations.


Iraq had asked Japan to extend its air force mission which its
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki described in a letter to Abe as
playing a "vital role" in reconstruction efforts.


In a separate meeting with Trade Minister Akira Amari, Hashimi
requested that Japanese companies invest in the development of
oil and gas in Iraq without hesitation, Kyodo News reported,
citing a Japanese trade ministry official who briefed reporters
about the meeting.


Hashimi told Amari that Japanese companies could end up lagging
behind Western oil majors if they became hesitant about investing
in Iraq, Kyodo said.
