One of six men accused of plotting failed bomb attacks in London
is alleged to have collaborated with two of the suicide bombers
who attacked the British capital two years ago, a court heard
Friday.


Muktar Said Ibrahim, 29, who is on trial over alleged involvement
in failed bombings in London on July 21, 2005, spent two weeks in
Pakistan at the same time as two of the four bombers who killed
themselves and 52 others two weeks earlier, it was claimed.


The allegation came from Stephen Kamlish, the lawyer representing
another of the six accused, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu.


He made the claim earlier in the trial but it can only be
reported now after reporting restrictions were lifted by the
judge.


Kamlish said he had seen documentary evidence proving that
Ibrahim was in Pakistan at the same time as Mohammed Sidique Khan
and Shehzad Tanweer.


Khan, Tanweer and two other men all died when they detonated
rucksack bombs on three London Underground trains and a bus at
rush hour on July 7, 2005 in what was the worst such attack on
British soil.
