Some 15 British Royal Navy sailors were detained by Iranian naval
vessels in the Gulf on Friday, the Ministry of Defence said,
demanding their immediate release and seeking urgent
clarification from Tehran.


"The British government is demanding the immediate and safe
return of our people and equipment," the ministry said in a
statement on the incident, which it said occurred after a routine
boarding of a merchant ship in Iraqi waters.


Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett summoned the Iranian
ambassador to seek clarification over the incident, which comes
amid mounting tension between Tehran and the West over its
nuclear programme.


"At approximately 1030 Iraqi time this morning, 15 British naval
personnel, engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant
shipping in Iraqi territorial waters ... were seized by Iranian
naval vessels," it said.


"The boarding party had completed a successful inspection of a
merchant ship when they and their two boats were surrounded and
escorted by Iranian vessels into Iranian territorial waters.


"We are urgently pursuing this matter with the Iranian
authorities at the highest level and on the instructions of the
Foreign Secretary, the Iranian ambassador has been summoned to
the Foreign Office.


"The British Government is demanding the immediate and safe
return of our people and equipment."
