Spain's stock market regulator CNMV said Friday it would prevent
construction group Acciona and Italian energy company Enel from
bidding for Spanish energy giant Endesa for six months from March
29, when an offer from E.ON of Germany will lapse.


Acciona, a Spanish company, and Enel said earlier they were
jointly seeking to outbid E.ON's public offer of 41 billion euros
(55 billion dollar) to Endesa shareholders which runs until March
29.


The CNMV promptly told E.ON to come back with another offer by
Monday to run to April 3, after which Acciona and Enel would have
to come back with their counter-bid.
