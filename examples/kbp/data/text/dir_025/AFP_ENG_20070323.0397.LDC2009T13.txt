Togolese international footballers, who threatened to boycott
last year's World Cup over a bonus row, are still waiting to
receive their bonus payments, Arsenal forward Emmanuel Adebayor
said Friday.


"The bonus problem is still there. We were given promises but
still nothing has been done," said Adebayor.


"We're still waiting to see the management and it's in their
interest to meet with us as soon as possible. Whatever happens,
we're not going to let this go. If they don't pay up, I don't
know what will happen."


Togo play Sierra Leone on Saturday in an African Nations Cup
qualifier.


But the players are still waiting to be paid roughly a third of
the 122,000 euros (162,000 dollars) they were promised for
reaching the World Cup finals in Germany.


Togo has a history of bonus disputes between players and football
officials.


Their participation in last year's African Nations Cup came under
threat until mediators found a solution at the last moment, only
for the problems to resurface in Germany.
