A European border agency patrol vessel intercepted a boat
carrying 300 illegal migrants from India and Pakistan off the
coast of Senegal, officials said Friday.


The boat, with a North Korean flag and named the "Happy Day," was
discovered about 80 nautical miles off Dakar, the Italian embassy
in Madrid said. The six members of the crew were arrested.


The Italian patrol vessel is part of the European border agency
Frontex, which began operations in February 2006 to intercept
migrants trying to make it from the west African coast to the
Spanish-controlled Canary Islands.


It includes naval and air support from Spain, France, Italy and
Luxembourg.


The Spanish government will be in contact with the migrants' home
countries to work out details of their return, Spain First Deputy
Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said.


Last year more than 31,000 illegal immigrants arrived in the
Canary Islands, as well as more than 1,500 since the start of
2007.


In a separate incident, Senegalese police have detained 38 people
who were allegedly preparing to travel illegally to Spain in a
small skiff, police said. Those detained Thursday included 30
Senegalese and eight Nigerians.
