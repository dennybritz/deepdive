The second wife of Earl Charles Spencer, the younger brother of
Britain's princess Diana, was granted a divorce on Friday on the
grounds of his "unreasonable behaviour."


District Judge Kenneth White granted Countess Caroline Spencer
the decree nisi at a hearing in London.


Divorce cases in Britain take place behind closed doors and press
reporting is restricted to the briefest of details.


Countess Spencer -- nee Caroline Victoria Hutton -- does not give
details of her former husband's behaviour.


The couple were married at the Spencer ancestral home in Althorp,
central England, in December 2001 and have two children. Both had
been married before.


Earl Spencer's six-year marriage to former model Victoria
Lockwood ended in divorce in 1996.


The 42-year-old gained worldwide exposure after his sister was
killed in a Paris car crash in August 1997 when he accused the
press of having blood on their hands for hounding her to death.


He followed up with a devastating oration at her funeral,
pledging to protect her sons, princes William and Harry, from the
stifling traditions of the royal family.
