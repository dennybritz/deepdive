Spain's stock market regulator said Friday it would bar
construction group Acciona and Italian energy company Enel from
bidding for Spanish energy giant Endesa for six months from March
29, when an offer from E.ON of Germany will lapse.


Acciona, a Spanish company, and Enel said earlier they were
jointly seeking to outbid E.ON's public offer of 41 billion euros
(55 billion dollar) to Endesa shareholders which runs until March
29.


Stock market regulator CNMV promptly told E.ON to come back with
another offer by Monday to run to April 3, after which Acciona
and Enel would have to come forward with their counter-bid.


Acciona and Enel are Endesa's main shareholders with a cumulative
46 percent of the company.


Both oppose the E.ON bid, as does the Spanish government, which
preferred an initial offer by Spain's Gas Natural.


Spanish media reports have said Acciona and Enel will pay 40
euros per Endesa share, just pipping the E.ON offer of 38.75 as
the race to pull off Europe's largest energy sector takeover bid
heats up.
