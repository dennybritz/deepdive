Latin American multiple Grammy award singer Shakira arrives in
Mumbai this weekend for her first hip-shaking Indian performance,
organisers said Friday.


Shakira, who is on a world tour for her "Oral Fixation Vol. 2"
album, will be performing some of her biggest hits including
"Hips don't lie", "Don't bother" and "Illegal" at the concert on
Sunday night in India's entertainment and financial capital.


Shakira "has a large fan base in India," said Venkat Vardhan,
chairman of DNA Networks, an event management firm.


Best known for sensual belly dancing and a powerful voice,
Shakira will arrive on Saturday and stay in the presidential
suite at a five-star hotel in Mumbai, media reports said.


The pop star will be pampered with her favourite exotic fruits --
papayas from Hawaii, peaches and prunes from Dubai and Australian
berries, Mumbai's Mirror newspaper reported.


In the run-up to Shakira's arrival, local newspapers have carried
articles detailing how to learn the singer's dance moves.


Shakira, who won Grammy awards in 2001 and 2003, dominated the
Latin Grammy awards last year, winning four trophies, including
album of the year for "Fijacion Oral Vol. 1".
