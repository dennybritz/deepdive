Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi was in an "stable"
condition after being wounded in a double bomb attack in Baghdad
on Friday, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's office said.


Maliki visited Zubayi in the hospital within hours after the
attack and was told that his deputy was stable, a statement from
his office said.


"The doctors said his condition was stable and there was no
reason to transfer him out of the country," it added.

"unstable condition" and was also undergoing surgery.


It was not known whether the surgery had finished.
