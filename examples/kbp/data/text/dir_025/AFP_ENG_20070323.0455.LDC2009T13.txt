Formula One team Spyker have filed a complaint accusing stables
Super Aguri and Toro Rosso of breaking the rules by using another
team's chassis, it was reported Friday.


Internet site autosport.com also said the case will be examined
by the chamber of commerce in Lausanne, which has powers to rule
in disputes relating to the Concorde agreement, which governs the
commercial side of Formula One.


Super Aguri and Toro Rosso, who are accused of using the same
chassis as their team partners instead of using their own
chassis, should receive formal notification of the action filed
against them in the next couple of days.


Spyker had already informed the International Automobile
Federation (FIA), the sport's ruling body, on the single-seaters
Super Aguri used throughout the Formula One world championships
but it was dismissed after they failed to file the complaint in
the time limit.


Toro Rosso use the same chassis as red Bull while Super Aguri
drives along with a Honda undercarriage.
