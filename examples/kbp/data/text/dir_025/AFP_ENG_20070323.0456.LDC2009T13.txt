The Czech Republic's police chief resigned Friday after being
suspected of playing a role in a massive corruption scandal.


"I am not leaving because I'm afraid of something," Vladislav
Husak said during a news conference broadcast on public
television. "It doesn't mean that I have a bad conscience."


The interior ministry has indicated that investigations show
Husak may have played a role in a scandal involving the licencing
of biofuel production.


The scandal has also led to the resignation of the deputy
transport minister, Petr Pospichal, in March last year.


Husak is suspected of having passed on confidential information
to suspects in the police investigation into the scandal, local
news media have reported.


Husak, 41, was named to his post in September 2005 by the
previous Social democrat government. His predecessor, accused of
helping a businessman suspected of fraud and murder flee, had
also resigned.


The Czech Republic ranks low on European annual corruption
surveys put together by the Transparency International NGO.


The new deputy prime minister and head of the Christian
democrats, Jiri Cunek, has been charged with accepting a bribe
from a construction company during his stint as mayor of the
eastern town of Vsetin.


He has refused to resign, embarrassing the center-right
government led by Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, who had pledged
to fight corruption.
