Ten thousand anti-globalisation protestors will demonstrate in
the German capital on Sunday during celebrations to mark the 50th
birthday of the European Union, organisers said.


Unions and anti-capitalist left-wing groups will march from
Alexanderplatz in the former East Berlin towards the city's best-
known monument, the Brandenburg Gate, where the 27 European Union
leaders will gather for a group photograph on Sunday.


Police said the demonstrators would be kept well away from the
Gate and that they were expecting a peaceful demonstration.


More than 5,000 police are expected to be on duty in Berlin and
while the security operation is extensive, the number is half the
figure deployed when US President George W. Bush visited Berlin
in 2002.


The celebrations mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the
Treaty of Rome establishing the European Economic Community, the
precursor to the EU, on March 25, 1957.
