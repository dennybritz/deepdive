A limit on the number of foreign players in club sides will be on
the agenda of the next meeting of world football chiefs in Zurich
in May, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Friday.


"I know that any idea of reform in this area will trigger
resistance, especially from big clubs and their coaches," said
Blatter, a long-standing supporter of a cap and a vehement critic
of big European clubs.


FIFA is considering a "Six plus Five" formula -- five foreign
players and six homegrown players on the field at any one time,
he added.


"It will also regulate prices. It's one of the topics on the
Congress agenda," he said after a meeting of the world governing
body's executive committee here


"When you have six plus five, you have to take homegrown players,
which you will have trained in your own team," he added,
underlining that countries like Belarus and Ukraine were already
taking a similar step.


"The idea of 11 foreign foreign players exist only in Europe," he
added, reiterating sharp criticism of big budget clubs like
Chelsea.


FIFA's Congress is due to take place on May 30-31.
