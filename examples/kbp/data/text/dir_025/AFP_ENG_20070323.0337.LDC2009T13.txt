The Croatian government has endorsed amended legislation opening
the way for the abolishment of compulsory military service, it
said Friday.


Under the new law which was forwarded to parliament, the
mandatory requirement for all young men to serve at least six
months in the military could be suspended under the orders of the
government and/or president.


Such a decision would depend on the security situation in the
former Yugoslav republic which fought a four-year war of
independence against Serb forces in the early 1990s.


According to unofficial information, the new legislation could
come into force as early as next year, when Croatia hopes to be
invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.


Croatia also aspires to modernise its army with the aim of making
it completely professional by 2014. The cost of the project is
estimated at some 1.2 billion euros (1.6 billion dollars).


The funds would be used notably to buy 12 fighter planes, 126
armored vehicles and navy equipment, and modernise the country's
anti-aircraft arsenal and infrastructure.


Under the plans, troop levels would be cut to 16,000 from the
current 25,000, including 6,000 reservists, 2,000 civilian staff
and 2,000 volunteers.


By 2010, Croatia plans to raise its military budget to 2.0
percent of its gross domestic product from 1.7 percent presently,
as part of NATO membership requirements.
