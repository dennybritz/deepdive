Werder Bremen striker Ivan Klasnic of Croatia announced that he
underwent a successful second kidney transplant after his body
rejected a kidney in January, a local daily reported Friday.


"The transplantation was successful, my body has accepted my
father's kidney" the 27-year-old told the Jutarnji List daily.


According to the paper Klasnic underwent the surgery on March 16
in a Hannover clinic, in Germany.


"I did not want to go public with the new surgery before the
doctors were sure that my body has accepted the new organ," he
added.


"Thank God everything is ok now, we feel very well both my father
and me. The doctors have told me that I would be able to play
football again," he stressed.


Klasnic was diagnosed with kidney failure during the Bundesliga's
winter break and has not played a game for Bremen since last
December.


In January, the Croatian's body rejected a kidney from his mother
leading to fears his career could be over.


With Klasnic out of contract by the end of the season, Bremen
have offered him a year's extension and the holder of 29 Croatian
caps was due to make a decision based on the operation's success.
