Visitors to an art exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of the
Treaty of Rome will take a journey across the European Union and
through five millennia of history as they view masterpieces from
each of the 27 member states.


The earliest work, the "Fat Lady" of Malta, represents a goddess
revered by the island's farmers in the third millennium BC, while
the latest is a 1976 painting by Per Kirkeby of Denmark,
"Profezia su Venezia".


Greece has offered a kore -- a statue of a young woman -- from
the Acropolis.


Taking pride of place beside the original European treaties also
on display in the hall, Athens has also supplied a fourth-century
BC Paestum vase painted with a scene of the "Rape of Europa" --
the myth in which Zeus seduces a Phoenician woman and makes her
the first queen of Crete.


The vase was rescued from traffickers last year.


France is represented by Auguste Rodin's "The Thinker", Italy by
Titian's "The Young Englishman" and Britain by William Turner's
painting "The Arrival of Louis-Philippe at Portsmouth".


Germany has loaned an Albrecht Duerer masterwork, "Portrait of
Jakob Muffel" and Spain Velazquez's "View of the Villa Medici
Gardens".


The exhibition opens Friday in a hall of Rome's presidential
Palazzo Quirinale usually closed to the public, the Salone dei
Corazzieri.


It will run until May 20.
