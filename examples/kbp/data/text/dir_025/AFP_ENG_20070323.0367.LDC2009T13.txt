Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich will hold talks with
EU leaders on Tuesday on a new cooperation agreement between Kiev
and the 27-nation bloc, a foreign ministry official told AFP.


Yanukovich, who will travel to Brussels in the company of new
Foreign Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, is to meet EU Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso and foreign policy chief Javier
Solana, the official said speaking on condition of anonymity.


He will also see members of the European Parliament and address
its committee on foreign affairs.


His talks on a new partnership accord will focus on the possible
creation of a free-trade area and an easing of visa restrictions
for Ukrainians.


The trip will be Yatsenyuk's first outside his country since his
appointment Wednesday to the top foreign ministry post.


He will arrive in the Belgian capital on Monday at the invitation
of EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the
foreign ministry said in a statement.


After his talks with the commissioner Yatsenyuk will also meet EU
Parliament officials.


Yatsenyuk, whose candidacy was put forward by Western-leaning
President Viktor Yushchenko, replaced Boris Tarasyuk who resigned
in January after clashing with the Kiev parliament's pro-Russian
majority.
