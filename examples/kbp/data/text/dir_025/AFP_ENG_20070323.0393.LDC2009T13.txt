Nearly 800 people have died after a meningitis epidemic spread
from Burkina Faso to eight other western African countries since
the start of the year, the United Nations said Friday.


Calling for urgent help to contain the epidemic, the head of the
UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in West
Africa Herve Ludovic de Lys warned it could spread further in
coming months.


"The fluidity of borders and traditional seasonal migration which
characterize the Sahel from May-June could rapidly spread the
illness in the weeks to come," he said in a written statement.


Although Burkina Faso has by far the largest number of cases,
Ivory Coast, Niger, Benin, Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, Chad and Togo
have also been affected to differing degrees.


"8,557 cases, including 798 deaths have been notified in West
Africa since the beginning of the year," the OCHA statement said.


Burkina Faso, one of the world's poorest nations, is in the so-
called "meningitis belt" that runs from Senegal across the
southern Sahara to Ethiopia.


On Monday, the World Health Organization pledged millions of
emergency vaccines to counter the meningitis epidemic in Burkina
Faso which has killed at least 583 people there.


The disease, which is an airborne virus infecting the brain and
spinal cord, usually breaks out during the December-January dry
season when it is carried by warm, dry winds. Symptoms include
fever, rashes and vomiting.
