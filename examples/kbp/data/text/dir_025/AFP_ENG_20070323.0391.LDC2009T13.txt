Ireland's foreign minister on Friday warned the country's cricket
fans about the danger of violent crime at their next World Cup
venue.


Dermot Ahern said he shared the fans' delight at the team's
qualification for the Super Eights stage, but reminded those
travelling Guyana to be vigilant.


"Crime levels in Guyana are high. I would advise Irish citizens
travelling to Guyana to exercise extreme caution," he said.


"Georgetown, the capital city where the Irish team is scheduled
to play on 30 March, 3 April and 9 April, is particularly badly
affected by violent crime."


Ireland is scheduled to play England, South Africa and New
Zealand on the three dates.


It is Ireland's first appearance at one-day cricket's showpiece
tournament.


The team is predominantly made up of part-time players who
balance their cricketing commitments with full-time careers.


Their tie with Zimbabwe and defeat of Pakistan has been one of
the big shocks of the tournament.


A loyal band of about 1,500 supporters -- dubbed the "Blarney
Army" in the Irish media -- had travelled to support the team.


It is not clear how many fans will have the funds to continue to
travel with their team or if they will be able to get more time
off work.
