The United States on Friday issued visas for Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his delegation ahead of a vote in the UN
Security Council, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.


The Iranian leader has asked to address the Council as it
prepares to vote on a resolution imposing new sanctions on Tehran
for refusing to rein in its suspect nuclear program.


"The passports with the visas with them have been delivered,"
McCormack said.


The Security Council vote is expected on Saturday.
