A cargo plane with 11 people aboard which crashed north of
Mogadishu on Friday was hit by a rocket, Somali government
spokesman Hussein Mohamed Muhamoud told AFP.


"Three rockets were fired at the plane and one of them hit the
plane. This is an act that will not be accepted by the Somali
people and government," he said.
