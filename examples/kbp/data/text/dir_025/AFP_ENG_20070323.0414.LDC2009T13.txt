Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are to reunite on screen for
the first time since their 1997 blockbuster "Titanic," it was
reported on Friday.


The duo will star as a suburban couple struggling to grapple with
post-war disillusionment in an adaptation of Richard Yates's 1961
novel "Revolutionary Road," movie industry daily Variety
reported.


The film will be directed by Winslet's husband, Oscar-winning
director Sam Mendes, and is to be made by Steven Spielberg's
Dreamworks, the report said. It will be the first time Mendes has
directed his wife, the report added.


Filming is to get underway later this year.


The reunion of DiCaprio and Winslet brings together two of the
hottest stars in show business. Both DiCaprio and British star
Winslet are strongly in demand for their recent performances in
"The Departed" and "Little Children," respectively.


DiCaprio has received three Oscar nominations during his career
while Winslet became the youngest woman to be nominated five
times for an Oscar earlier this year for her portrayal of an
adulteress in "Little Children."


"Titanic" remains the biggest box-office hit of all time with 1.8
billion dollars in earnings. It also won a record-equalling 11
Oscars.


Yates's "Revolutionary Road" follows a couple living in
Connecticut in 1955, both struggling to find fulfilment in their
lives.


The novel was a hit upon publication and was shortlisted for the
National Book Award along with "Catch 22" and "The Moviegoer."
