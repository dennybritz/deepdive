Taliban militants attacked a convoy delivering supplies to
foreign troops in southern Afghanistan Friday, killing 17 Afghan
security guards and drivers, their commander said.


Another four guards were missing in the ambush by about 100
Taliban in southern province of Kandahar, the commander of the
pro-government militia that had been guarding the convoy said.


Police did not have information about the ambush.


"Fifteen security guards and two truck drivers were killed in the
attack," commander Abdul Manan said.


"Four guards are missing. Five trucks and one pick-up truck were
burned to ashes. Taliban have taken one of the pick-up trucks,"
he said.


The convoy was attacked on the highway between Kabul and the main
city in the south, Kandahar. It had been travelling to a military
base in Zabul province.


There are several foreign and Afghan groups providing security to
private companies in Afghanistan, including those that deliver
logistics to military bases and construction projects.


Militants with the extremist Taliban movement, which was toppled
from power in late 2001 in a US-led offensive, target these
security guards and other people working for the government and
its allies.


The Taliban-led insurgency was its bloodiest last year, leaving
more than 4,000 people dead -- most of them rebels.
