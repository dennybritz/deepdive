US home sales rose 3.9 percent in February as the struggling real
estate market showed some signs of a rebound, industry data
showed Friday.


The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said existing home
sales improved to an annualized pace of 6.69 million, well ahead
of market expectations of a pace of 6.30 million.


The monthly report showed signs that lower prices -- following a
long boom in the property market that ended last year -- are
starting to stimulate sales.


The median sales price fell 1.3 percent to 212,800 dollars, the
seventh decline in a row.
