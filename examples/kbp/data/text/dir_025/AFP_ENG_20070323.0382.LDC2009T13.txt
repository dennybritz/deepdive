The White House on Friday rebuffed calls to shut down the
Guantanamo Bay prison for suspected terrorists, as a news report
said the new US defense chief had argued it should be closed.


Spokesman Tony Snow declined to confirm a New York Times report
that Defense Secretary Robert Gates had pushed to shutter the
facility shortly after he took over his post in December, citing
its "tainted" image abroad.


US President George W. Bush "would love to be able to shut it
down, but, unfortunately, circumstances do not presently permit
him to do so," Snow told reporters.


The spokesman said that "if you read the (news) stories" Gates
"understands what the difficulties are" after discussing the
situation with Attorney General Al Gonzales.


"You do not want to transfer Guantanamo prisoners on the
continental US shores," said Snow, who added that the United
States is trying to repatriate as many detainees as possible but
"many of the countries don't want them back."


Bringing the prisoners to the United States from the US military
base in Cuba would have legal ramifications, potentially
expanding the detainees' rights and encouraging them or others to
file lawsuits challenging their imprisonment, US officials have
said.
