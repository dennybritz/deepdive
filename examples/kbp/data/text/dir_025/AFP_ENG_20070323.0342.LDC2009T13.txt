Ireland won the toss and chose to bat in the World Cup Group D
match against West Indies on Friday at Sabina Park.


Both sides made one change to the line-ups from their previous
matches.


Ireland have brought John Mooney in to replace captain Trent
Johnston, who has not recovered from a shoulder injury he
sustained in last Saturday's win against Pakistan.


Kyle McCallan will lead the Irish side in Johnston's absence.


West Indies have included Ian Bradshaw ahead of Corey Collymore
in a rotation of their bowlers.


Both sides have secured their pass to the Super Eights of the
competition, but the outcome of the match will be vital, since
the winning side will start the next stage of the competition
with the two points they will gain from victory.


West Indies lead the group with four points, Ireland are second
on three, Pakistan are third on two points, and Zimbabwe are last
on one.


West Indies: Brian Lara (captain), Chris Gayle, Shivnarine
Chanderpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Bravo,
Dwayne Smith, Denesh Ramdin, Ian Bradshaw, Daren Powell, Jerome
Taylor.


Ireland: Kyle McCallan (captain), Jeremy Bray, William
Porterfield, Eoin Morgan, Niall O'Brien, Andre Botha, Kevin
O'Brien, Andrew White, John Mooney, Dave Langford-Smith.
