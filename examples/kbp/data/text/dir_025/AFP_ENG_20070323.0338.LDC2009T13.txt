A New York court sentenced a Belize cocaine trafficker with links
to a Colombian paramilitary group to 33 years in jail, officials
said.


Robert James Hertular was handed the 400-month term for
conspiring to traffic tonnes of cocaine into the United States
and threatening to kill US federal agents investigating him in
Belize, a statement from a New York prosecutor said Thursday.


He also was ordered to pay a 250,000-dollar fine by a district
judge.


The 36-year-old was first arrested in 2001 when Belize
authorities seized 1.1 tonnes of cocaine heading from the central
American country to the US from Colombia. He was later extradited
to the US on other charges in 2004.


While facing charges in Belize, he threatened that he could have
hitmen murder agents of the US Drug Enforcement Administration
unless they called off their own investigations into his cocaine
trafficking.


Hertular told the DEA in 2001 that he had trafficking links to
Carlos Castano, the late leader of the United Self-Defense Forces
of Colombia (AUC) paramilitary organisation, according to the
statement.
