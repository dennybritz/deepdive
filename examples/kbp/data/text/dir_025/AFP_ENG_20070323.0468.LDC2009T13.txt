Lionel Dumont, a French convert to Islam who fought with Muslim
insurgents in Bosnia, appeared in a Paris court Friday to appeal
against a 30-year prison sentence for a series of armed
robberies.


Dumont, 36, was a member of the socalled "Roubaix gang" of
Islamic militants who carried out a series of hold-ups in the
north of France at the start of 1996. He was convicted in
December 2005.


After converting to Islam in 1991, Dumont travelled to Bosnia as
an aid worker and joined the international Muslim brigade that
was fighting Serbs and Croats in the former Yugoslav republic.
