Poland's Adam Malysz moved back to the top of the World Cup
leaderboard after winning the first of three events here on
Friday.


Malysz scored 423.5 points to edge Switzerland's Simon Ammann
into second, with 408.4pts, and Slovenia's Jernej Damjan
(402.6pts) took third.


World champion Malysz made the most of Norwegian Anders
Jacobsen's sixth place finish to take over top spot in the World
Cup standings with just two events to go before the season's end.


Jacobsen had claimed the lead a week ago in Oslo, where Malysz
could finish only 54th.


But victory here, on the longest hill in the world, was the 36th
win in the four-time world champion and three-time World Cup
winner's career.


However, his jump of 221.5m was still some way off the world
record of 239m set by Norway's Bjoern Einar Romoeren here in
2005.
