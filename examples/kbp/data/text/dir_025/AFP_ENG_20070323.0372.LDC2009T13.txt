FIFA President Sepp Blatter on Friday dampened England's hopes of
hosting the World Cup in 2018, saying a decision on rotating the
event between continents will not be taken before the end of
2007.


"Europe is very keen on getting the World Cup in 2018, especially
England, but I couldn't promise England that they would have it,"
Blatter said after an executive committee meeting at world
football's governing body.


FIFA agreed several years ago to rotate the World Cup between its
main regions, partly in a bid to ensure an African nation hosted
the event in 2010.


Blatter told journalists it was not clear if the rotation would
continue after 2014, when the World Cup heads to South America,
and if it does, in what form or order.


The executive committee is likely to make a decision once it
chooses the host for 2014 in December, Blatter said. Currently
Brazil and Colombia are candidates.


"I can't give you the outcome of a decision, it will depend on
the executive committee," Blatter said, referring to rotation.
FIFA's executive committee is also due to change in May.


If rotation continues with its current regional breakdown and
sequence, the 2018 World Cup should technically be held in an
Asian country.


Blatter recently met British sports minister Richard Caborn and
the Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Gordon Brown
-- who is widely touted to succeed Tony Blair as prime minister.
