Gunmen on Friday kidnapped three foreigners in oil-rich southern
Nigeria, including a Dutch national working for a German
construction company, police and industry sources said.


Two industry sources said the other two victims were "Lebanese
nationals working for Cetraco", a construction company. A senior
police officer, however, said one of the men was Indian.
