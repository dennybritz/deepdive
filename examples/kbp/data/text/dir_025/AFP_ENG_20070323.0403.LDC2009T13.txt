Struggling Italian first division side Parma signed a 52-year-old
comedian on Friday.


Italian comic and television presenter Gene Gnocchi made an
appeal in November asking for a top flight club to help him
fullfill his dream of playing in Serie A.


His plea won the backing of many leading footballers including
Juventus and Italy striker Alessandro Del Piero, and Gnocchi
trained with Atalanta, Siena and Torino without securing a deal.


But on Friday Parma gave him a two-month contract and registered
him as their player with the Italian Football League (Lega-
Calcio).


Parma president Tommaso Ghiradi said he hoped Gnocchi would bring
them luck.


"If we manage to avoid relegation, it will mean Gnocchi has been
our lucky charm," he said.


"It will also secure him a contract for next season!"


Asked why he took Gnocchi on, Ghiradi replied: "We need to laugh
a little.


"The players are a bit tense and he will know how to lift the
spirit in the dressing room."


Parma are currently second from bottom with 10 matches to play,
so Gnocchi may have to wait until the club have ensured their
place in Serie A before he can fullfill his dream.
