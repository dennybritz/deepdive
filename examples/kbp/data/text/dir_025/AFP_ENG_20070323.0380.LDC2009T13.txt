Austrian and Czech police have dismantled a network of suspected
arms traffickers and seized a large cache of weapons, authorities
announced Friday.


The group of three Czech Republic nationals and nine Austrians
face between three and 10 years in prison, Czech police
spokeswoman Blanka Kosinova said.


The arrests resulted from a joint operation between Austrian and
Czech police.


Police conducted 18 searches in connection with the arrests,
yielding 24 machine guns, 55 other firearms and a large number of
silencers, Kosinova said.


The weapons included CZ-61 Skorpion machine guns, which are
designed for defense and close combat, and their small size makes
them easy to hide, military sources said.


Members of the group allegedly sold that type of gun in Austria
for 900 euros (1,200 dollars) without silencers or 1,100 euros
(1,500 dollars) with silencers, Kosinova said.
