The French National Rugby League (LNR) announced on Friday they
will be introducing television match officials for first division
and division two playoff games next season.


Video referees are used in many sports already including cricket
and ice hockey and despite television match officials already in
use for international rugby union test matches, it is a first for
French club rugby.


Referees will also wear microphones from the 2007/08 season
onwards so their decisions can be heard.


The measures follow the recently successful bid by French
entertainment group Canal Plus to aquire television rights for
all Top 14 matches for the next four seasons at a cost of over
100 million euros.
