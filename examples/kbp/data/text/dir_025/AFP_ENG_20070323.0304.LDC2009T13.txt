Tennis legend Martina Navratilova said Thursday she wants to open
a tennis academy in her native Czech Republic, although not one
along the lines of those in her adopted America.


"I'm not too keen on the way tennis is taught, particularly in
the United States," said Navratilova, who dislikes the
concentration on the power side of the game.


"I want to concentrate on a more varied form of tennis, more
subtle than the style displayed by Martina Hingis, Justine Henin
or Roger Federer."


The 50-year-old's project is only in its initial phase.


"I want children to learn something. We have to show coaches how
they need to coach tennis," she added.


Navratilova is the most successful tennis player of all time,
winning 59 Grand Slam titles, including 18 singles crowns, over a
career that lasted more than 30 years and only ended last season,
shortly before her 50th birthday.


Since hanging up her racket, Navratilova has spent a lot of time
visiting her mother in the Czech Republic.
