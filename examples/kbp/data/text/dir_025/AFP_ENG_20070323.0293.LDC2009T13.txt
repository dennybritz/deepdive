India captain Rahul Dravid elected to field after winning the
toss against Sri Lanka in a crucial World Cup match at the
Queen's Park Oval here on Friday.


India are in a must-win situation after winning just one of their
two matches, while Sri Lanka have won both of their games in
Group B to boost hopes of qualifying for the next Super Eight
stage.


Bangladesh, who also have posted one win in two matches, will
take on debutants Bermuda in the last group game here on Sunday.


India made one change from the side that beat Bermuda by a record
257 runs, bringing in off-spinner Harbhajan Singh in place of
leg-spinner Anil Kumble.


Fast bowler Dilhara Fernando replaced Farveez Maharoof for the
only change in the Sri Lanka side which beat Bangladesh in the
previous game on Wednesday.


Both India and Sri Lanka had a light workout in bright sunshine
before the match.
