World number two Maria Sharapova has confirmed that she will make
her Fed Cup debut for Russia in the first round tie against Spain
on April 21-22 in Moscow.


"I'm really excited to make my first appearance in the Fed Cup
for my country and it is great to be playing the tie in Moscow,"
the US Open champion told www.fedcup.com.


"Hopefully, myself and the team will put up a strong showing
against Spain, who have a good team."


Sharapova was born in Nyagan, Siberia, but moved to Florida at
the age of nine to train at the renown Nick Bollettieri Academy.


The 19-year-old has never played for Russia, partly because of
her strained relationship with other players, notably former
French Open champion Anastasia Myskina.


Russia won the women's tennis team title in 2004 and 2005.
