Three Turkish soldiers were killed and two others were wounded
Friday in a landmine explosion blamed on separatist Kurdish
rebels, the Anatolia news agency reported.


The blast occurred when the military vehicle carrying the
soldiers ran over the landmine in a rural area in the
southeastern province of Diyarbakir, the agency said.


It said the landmine had been laid by "terrorists" -- the
official term used to describe rebels from the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK).


More than 37,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the PKK
took up arms for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast of
Turkey.


The group, listed as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and much
of the international community, called a unilateral ceasefire
last October.


Turkey has rejected the truce, but fighting has largely subsided
since then.
