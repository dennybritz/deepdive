Investigators have found a rodent-killing chemical sprayed on
imported Chinese wheat in the tainted pet food that has killed
several animals in the US and Canada, ABC television reported
Friday.


"A source close to the investigation tells ABC News that the
rodenticide, which the source says is illegal to use in the
United States, was on wheat that was imported from China and used
by Menu Foods in nearly 100 brands of dog and cat food," the US
network said in its website.


Several people have filed suit in US courts following the deaths
of their pets, including that of a cat called Phoenix in Chicago
and another called Samoya in the northwestern state of Oregon,
court sources said.


A couple in the US state of Arkansas have sued for compensation
for costs incurred by the illness and death of their dog Abby.


In the northern state of Wisconsin a woman also filed a complaint
concerning her cat Gumbi, who will require life-long treatment
following kidney failure caused by pet food.


Last week Menu Foods issued a massive recall of 60 million cans
and pouches of food.


ABC said the chemical at issue is aminopterin. So far however
investigators have not said if this is the only contaminant in
all of the recalled food, ABC reported.


"There is some good news according to the source. Knowing the
chemical should aid veterinarians who are treating animals that
have been sickened by the pet food," it added.


Pet owners in Canada also sued the Canadian branch of the company
over the alleged taintings.
