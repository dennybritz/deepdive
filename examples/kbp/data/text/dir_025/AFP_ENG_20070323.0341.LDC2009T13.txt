The United States wants to reach an agreement by the end of the
year on deploying anti-missile defenses in eastern Europe, a
senior US official said Friday.


Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mark Pekala told reporters
that formal talks have begun with Poland and the Czech Republic
over installing anti-missile missiles and "we would like to have
the agreements accomplished by the end of the year."


A total of 10 interceptor missiles and their accompanying radar
would be deployed by about 2010, Pekala said.


But the comments came as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
said the US plan for a shield against potential attacks from Iran
and North Korea threatened Russia and undermined cooperation in
the United Nations.


Lavrov wrote in Moscow's Moskovskiye Novosti newspaper Friday
that "if our Western partners are deploying elements of the US
national anti-missile defence system on the pretext of an
'Iranian threat' ... then what's the point of the UN Security
Council?"


"I hope our American partners think about this, especially as
they are calling on us to fight a hypothetical threat while
creating a real threat to our security," Lavrov wrote.
