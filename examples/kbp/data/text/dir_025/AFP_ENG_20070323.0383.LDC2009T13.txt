Two passenger aircraft skidded off their runways after landing in
Turkey in separate incidents on Friday, but no one was hurt, news
agency Anatolia reported.


An Ariana airline flight landing at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul
swerved to the left not long after touching down, Anatolia news
agency said.


The Airbus 300 carrying 50 people sank into the ground and came
to a stop about 100 meters (330 feet) later.


The aircraft's right wing broke during the incident, Anatolia
said. Airport officials said they have requested an alcohol test
for the pilots.


Ariana is an Afghan company.


The second aircraft was landing in Agri, a mountainous region in
eastern Turkey. The Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul
traveled about 30 meters (98 feet) off the runway, Anatolia said.
