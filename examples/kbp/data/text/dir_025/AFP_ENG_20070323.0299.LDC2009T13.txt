Kidnappers have targeted the family of the head of a restive
province in southern Russia for the second time in a year,
snatching his uncle on Friday, a regional administration
spokesman said.


Uruskhan Zyazikov was walking to a village mosque with two other
relatives when four armed men drove up in a car and opened fire,
a spokesman for Ingushetia's president Murat Zyazikov told AFP.


"Two of the three were injured. Uruskhan was taken to an unknown
place," the spokesman said.


"The forces behind this are people that cannot get used to the
fact that the republic is moving in a positive direction," he
added.


Ingushetia neighbours war-ravaged Chechnya in the heart of the
mostly Muslim north Caucasus mountains and has been plagued by
killings and disappearances, some aimed against rule by Moscow
and pro-Kremlin leader Zyazikov.


Zyazikov, a former general in the Russian FSB secret service
(formerly the KGB), was first elected in 2002 with support from
Russian President Vladimir Putin.


His father-in-law was kidnapped by Islamist fighters last year
and released after two months in captivity.
