Jealousy of David Beckham on the part of his team-mates doomed
England's World Cup campaign in Germany last year according to
the agent of manager Sven-Goran Eriksson.


Agent Pini Zahavi said that the Swede had told him "the whole
story" behind his side's disappointing campaign that ended in a
penalty shoot-out defeat to Portugal.


Beckham subsequently resigned as captain and has been left out of
England squads since by new boss Steve McClaren.


"There was a big problem with jealously at the World Cup -
something no-one has ever talked about," Zahavi said.


"A lot of people didn't like Beckham's position within the team.
It was one of the biggest things that hurt England.


"A lot of players didn't like the 'super player' Beckham. They
didn't like his status in the team.


"If Sven told the whole story of what went on in Germany - and I
know the whole story because I have talked to him a lot - people
would understand what happened.


"One of the main problems was Sven had too much respect for
several players. If you look at it professionally, Beckham
shouldn't have played at certain times. But Sven put him in
anyway.


"Now, at least, all the players are equal under McClaren.''
