The Pakistan World Cup cricket squad, rocked by the murder of
coach Bob Woolmer, want to leave Jamaica and return home as soon
as possible, team manager Talat Ali said.


After having given statements to police and been finger-printed
on Thursday, the Pakistan team's chance of any rest and
relaxation at their luxury hotel resort here were dashed with the
players obliged to give DNA samples.


"Our priority is to take the players back to Pakistan," Ali said.


"Everyone in Pakistan is looking forward (to their return),
especially the families of the players. They want the boys back
in Pakistan as soon as possible.


"We've given whatever information they (the police) have asked us
about, we've had our interviews and they're going to have our
DNA, and we should be allowed to take the first available flight
back to Pakistan."


Woolmer's death by strangulation a day after his team were
knocked out of cricket's showpiece by minnows Ireland has become
a diplomatic incident amid rumours of involvement by match-fixing
gangs.
