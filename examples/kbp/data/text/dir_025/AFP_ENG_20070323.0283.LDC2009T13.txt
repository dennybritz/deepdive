Israel on Friday released the oldest son of jailed intifada
leader Marwan Barghuti from prison after he had served 39 months
for participating in the uprising and belonging to a banned
group, his lawyers said.


Qassam Barghuti, 23, was freed from a prison in the southern
Israeli city of Ashkelon and returned to his family home in the
West Bank town of Ramallah.


Upon his arrival in Ramallah, he visited the tomb of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat accompanied by his mother, Fadwa.


He was detained by Israeli security forces on December 24, 2003
as he tried to cross into the occupied West Bank from Jordan.


An Israeli military tribunal later convicted him of belonging to
a banned group and participating in the second Palestinian
uprising, or intifada, that erupted in September 2000.


His father, Marwan, is the charismatic West Bank leader of
president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party and was a key player during
the early days of the second intifada.


Marwan Barghuti was arrested by Israel in April 2002 and
convicted in May 2004 on five counts of murder and one of
attempted murder resulting from three suicide attacks and one
failed attack. He is currently serving five life sentences.


His incarceration has not diminished his appeal on the
Palestinian street -- in January 2006, he was re-elected to the
Palestinian parliament and he is widely seen as a possible
successor to Abbas.


An early release for Barghuti would require a presidential
pardon.
