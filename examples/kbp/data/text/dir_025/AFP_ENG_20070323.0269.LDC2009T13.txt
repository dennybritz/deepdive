A car bomb in a Baghdad car market Friday killed four people and
wounded 19, a security official said.


The bombing took place in east Baghdad's Al-Habibiyah district,
the official said.


The bombers struck a few hours after a double bomb attack wounded
Iraq's Sunni deputy prime minister Salam al-Zubahyi.


Six people were killed and 15 wounded in the attack on Zubayi.


Insurgents have managed to carry out a spate of car bombings in
Baghdad despite a massive security crackdown in the capital to
curb insurgent and sectarian bloodshed.
