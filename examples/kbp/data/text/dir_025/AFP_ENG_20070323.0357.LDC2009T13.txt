World football's governing body FIFA on Friday gave the thumbs up
to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, saying its doubts about
security and logistics for the event have been dispelled.


"South Africa, we trust you," FIFA President Sepp Blatter
announced after a meeting of governing body chiefs here.


"The executive committee is now convinced that South Africa will
be a good host for the World Cup," he added.


"Today they all stand united behind South Africa and the
organisation of this important competition."


Blatter said a key confidence-building step had been taken by the
South African government in February with its approval of an
additional budget to tackle security for fans and visitors,
transport and logistics.


FIFA had reiterated concern at the lack of progress on building
work for new stadiums in South Africa at its last executive
commitee meeting in December, when Blatter called for "a little
bit of fire" in the preparations.


South African World Cup chief executive Danny Jordaan had pledged
that all unfinished stadiums would be ready by October 2007.


Horst R. Schmidt, vice president of the 2010 organising committee
told a German newspaper Thursday that the organisers were on
schedule.


"I do not doubt for a second that the World Cup will take place
in South Africa, it will be a different World Cup from the one
which took place last summer in Germany, but it will certainly
not be any less impressive," added Schmidt, who is also general
secretary of the German Football Federation (DFB).
