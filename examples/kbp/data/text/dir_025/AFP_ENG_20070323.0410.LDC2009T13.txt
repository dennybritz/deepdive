Taliban militants attacked a convoy delivering supplies to
foreign troops in southern Afghanistan Friday, killing 17 Afghan
security guards and drivers, their commander said.


Another four guards were missing in the ambush by about 100
Taliban in the southern province of Kandahar, the commander of
the private group that had been guarding the convoy said.


Police did not have information about the attack.
