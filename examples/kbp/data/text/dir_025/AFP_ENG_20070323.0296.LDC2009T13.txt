US shares opened slightly lower Friday with investors eagerly
awaiting an update on February home sales which most analysts
were expecting to have slowed.


In opening deals, the Down Jones Industrial Average was down 9.13
points (0.07 percent) at 12,452.01.


The Nasdaq composite had shed 1.02 points (0.04 percent) to
2,450.72 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 lost 0.98
points (0.07 percent) to 1,433.56.


Most economists expect the government to announce later this
morning that existing homes sales dipped to an annualized 6.30
million units last month, compared with a 6.46 million unit sales
pace in January.


The downturn in the housing market has heightened concerns on
Wall Street amid fears that the market slump could trigger a
wider economic slowdown.
