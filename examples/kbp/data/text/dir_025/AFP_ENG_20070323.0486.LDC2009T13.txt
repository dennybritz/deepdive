Venezuela, the world number-five oil exporter, plans to issue
bonds worth a total of as much as five billion dollars through
its state oil giant PDVSA this week, authorities said Friday.


The 10-, 20- and 30-year bonds will go on sale Monday and be
available through Thursday, said PDVSA chief and Energy Minister
Rafael Ramirez.


The bonds issue -- aimed at raising 60 billion dollars through
2010 -- in part will be used to back a plan geared to boosting
oil production which is at 3.3 million barrels per day to 5.8
million bpd, according to PDVSA.


PDVSA budgeted for 2006 investment of 5.9 billion dollars, double
the historical rate, Ramirez said.


The state also has transferred 8.7 billion dollars' worth of
resources to the National Development Fund for domestic and
international aid and development projects.
