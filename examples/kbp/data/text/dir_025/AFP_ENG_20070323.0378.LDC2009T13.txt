A Turkish court sentenced four policemen to  nearly nine years in
jail on Friday for torturing to death a suspect 16 years ago, but
allowed them to walk free, the Anatolia agency reported.


They were found guilty of torturing and beating Birtan Altinbas,
a student arrested for alleged membership of a secret far-left
group who died in police custody in January 1991.


The Ankara court said the blows were not intended to be fatal,
and took account of the policemen's good behaviour in sentencing
them to eight years, 10 months and 20 days in prison.


However, the judge decided not to immediately send them to jail,
saying only that the men -- who have been free throughout the
case -- must stay in Turkey.


A series of legal rows, including the initial refusal by the
authorities to allow the policemen to appear in court, meant the
case became a test of Ankara's willingness to deal with police
violence.


The four men, who have always protested their innocence, were
sentenced in an earlier trial to four and a half years in jail,
but the convictions were quashed on appeal.


A fifth suspect died during the proceedings and a sixth was
acquitted.
