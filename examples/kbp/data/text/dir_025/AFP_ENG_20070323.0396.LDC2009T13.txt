A Zimbabwean court Friday postponed the extradition hearing of
Briton Simon Mann over a coup plot in Equatorial Guinea after
concerns were raised that he was tortured, his lawyer said.


"We have agreed that the hearing resumes on April 13 after we
raised concerns that the CID (Criminal Investigations Department)
had tortured him (Mann)," Jonathan Samkange, the lawyer
representing Mann told AFP.


"The prosecution has promised to look into the matter when we
resume."


Mann was arrested along with 69 other alleged mercenaries on
March 7, 2004, when a plane stopped over in Harare to pick up
weapons that the men claim were to be used to guard a diamond
mine in Democratic Republic of Congo.


They were allegedly actually on their way to Equatorial Guinea,
where Mann had masterminded a plot to topple President Teodoro
Obiang Nguema Mbasogo


Mann was given a four year jail term and is expected to be
released in May if Equatorial Guinea's application for his
extradition is not successful.
