The United States on Friday issued visas for Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his delegation ahead of a vote in the UN
Security Council, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.


The Iranian leader has asked to address the Council as it
prepares to vote on a resolution imposing new sanctions on Tehran
for refusing to rein in its suspect nuclear program.


"The passports with the visas with them have been delivered,"
McCormack said, adding they were delivered at 10:00 am (0900 GMT)
in Bern, Switzerland.


Some of the requests for visas from the Iranian delegation were
still being examined and had not yet been granted, he added.


The Security Council vote is expected on Saturday.


"Our intention is that there should be a vote Saturday,"
Britain's UN Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry told reporters after the
15-member Security Council met late Thursday to consider the
latest changes to the draft resolution.


"We'll meet tomorrow (Friday) for one final consideration. But
the text is in blue," indicating it is ready for an imminent
vote.


A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
draft was expected to receive overwhelming support.
