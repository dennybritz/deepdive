Scotland's Catriona Matthew and South Korea's Young Jo remained
tied for the lead after Friday's completion of the weather-halted
first round of the LPGA Safeway International.


Both were in the clubhouse when storms struck Thursday, stranding
72 players on the course at the 1.5 million-dollar event and
forcing them to complete their round Friday morning before the
start of round two.


Norway's Suzann Pettersen finished her first round Friday on 69,
matching Mexico's Lorena Ochoa and Korean Mi Hyun Kim for third
as the second round began.


England's Johanna Head, Korean Hee-Won Han and Americans Nancy
Scranton and Laura Diaz matched Thursday finisher American Beth
Bader on 70. Australian Rachel Hetherington joined a pack on 71
after completing her round Friday.


Matthew returned from maternity leave in style. She gave birth to
a daughter in December, but her on-course focus remained as
strong as ever with a round of six birdies and two bogeys that
left her tied with Jo.


The pair had to contend with very tricky windy conditions, but
were lucky to finish before the storm.


World No. 1 Annika Sorenstam of Sweden finished her final three
holes Friday to stand on 73. She was 1-over through 15 holes when
play was halted, then finished with three pars. Sorenstam won on
this same course in 2004 and 2005.
