The United States on Thursday urged Belarus to end harassment of
political opponents in Belarus after reports authorities there
were clamping down on dissent ahead of a protest rally.


"The United States is deeply concerned about ongoing intimidation
by the authorities of Belarus toward NGO activists, political
party leaders and young people in advance of a planned peaceful
demonstration in Minsk on March 25," State Department spokesman
Sean McCormack said in a statement.


"We urge the government of Belarus to allow its citizens to
exercise their right to assemble peacefully and express their
views without harassment or interference," he added.


"It is also essential that security forces exercise restraint
against demonstrators."


Opponents of Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander
Lukashenko say police are arresting activists on flimsy pretexts
such as swearing, and opposition gatherings have been banned on
Minsk's central Oktyabrskaya Square.


The rally planned for Sunday comes a year after unprecedented
protests in the capital against presidential elections in which
Lukashenko was overwhelmingly declared the victor.


Ales Belyatsky, the head of the human rights group Vyasna in
Belarus, told AFP police had imprisoned activists hoping to rally
with key opposition leaders including former presidential
candidate Alexander Milinkevich.


McCormack's statement said: "We reiterate our concern for the
well-being of all prisoners held on politically motivated charges
and call for their immediate release."
