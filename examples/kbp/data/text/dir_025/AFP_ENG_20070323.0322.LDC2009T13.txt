Shares in German carmaker Volkswagen soared in afternoon trading
here on Friday after rumours that its biggest shareholder,
Porsche, was preparing a public stock offering.


VW shares were up 5.36 percent to 116.74 euros on the Dax index.


A trader said the market was speculating on Porsche making a
public stock offering on Monday with shares at between 117 and
118 euros.


Porsche has a 27.4-percent stake in VW and has expressed its
intention of upping its holding to 29.9 percent, just below the
limit of 30 percent that under German law would trigger a
takeover bid.


But the luxury carmaker has said several times it has no
intention of exceeding a 29.9-percent holding.
