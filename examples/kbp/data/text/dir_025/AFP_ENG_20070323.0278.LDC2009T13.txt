Pope Benedict XVI met Friday with Irish President Mary McAleese,
discussing the future of Europe and the peace process for
Northern Ireland, the Vatican said.


During the meeting, which took place in a "climate of great
cordiality," the two also discussed the situation of the Catholic
Church in Ireland, in particular on the start of a "structured
dialogue" between the Irish state and the Church, the Holy See
said in a communique.


Benedict praised Ireland for its "selfless" development aid to
poor African countries.


In the traditional exchange of gifts, McAleese offered the pope
three books and a Waterford crystal table crucifix, while she
received an etching of the first basilica of Saint Peter as well
as rosaries and pontifical medals.


The Irish president met later with Vatican Secretary of State
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone.
