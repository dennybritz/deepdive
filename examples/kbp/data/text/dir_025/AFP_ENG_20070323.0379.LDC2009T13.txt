Vandals have wrecked the Hogwarts Express, the steam train that
ferries boy wizard Harry Potter and his chums to school in the
blockbuster films, operator West Coast Railways said Friday.


The train was attacked at a depot in Carnforth, northwest
England, on March 10 and had more than 230 of its windows smashed
with hammers.


The damage to the train will cost at least 50,000 pounds (74,000
euros, 98,000 dollars) to repair, the steam train charter company
said.


British Transport Police and forensic experts spent several days
combing the scene for clues but no-one has been arrested yet and
enquiries are continuing.


The train -- which is normally hired out for tourists and is
loaned to film company Warner Bros. for the Harry Potter films --
was attacked in 2003, when 3,000 pounds of damage was caused by
graffiti sprayed on a carriage.


In October 2005, Harry Potter's flying car -- a pale blue 1962
Ford Anglia -- mysteriously disappeared from a film set in
Cornwall, southwest England. It was found in May last year in a
nearby ruined castle.
