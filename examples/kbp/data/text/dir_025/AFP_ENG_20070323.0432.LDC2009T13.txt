At least 60 people, most of them government troops, have been
killed in two days of fighting between Democratic Republic of
Congo troops and guards of opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba,
hospital and diplomatic sources said Friday.


Western security sources said the presidential Republican Guard
had lost 12 men and the army's 7th Brigade 37.


But they also quoted commanders of Bemba's bodyguard as saying
their dead, wounded, missing or deserted approached 400, without
being able to give a breakdown of the figures.


Meamwhile officials at various Kinshasa hospitals told AFP that
around 10 bodies of civilians had been brought to their morgues.


Civilian and military wounded in the hospitals were put at 60 at
least, not counting those being cared for by the UN mission in
DRC.
