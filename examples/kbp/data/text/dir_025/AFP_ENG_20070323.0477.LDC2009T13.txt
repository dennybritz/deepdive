Kenya batsman Ravindu Shah has voiced his frustration at the lack
of "quality cricket" his country plays between World Cups.


Four years ago Kenya reached the World Cup semi-finals, beating
1996 champions Sri Lanka along the way.


They now face England here Saturday in a winner-takes-all clash
for the right to join New Zealand as one of the two qualifiers
out of Group C for the second phase, Super Eight stage of this
World Cup.


However, few expect them to cause another upset and Shah, Kenya's
leading scorer at the 2003 World Cup, thinks he knows the answer
why.


"We always seem to be playing catch-up. After a big tournament we
don't have quality cricket to follow up," he told the BBC on
Friday. "Rather than progressing it's a stop-start situation.


"In the last four years we really haven't played any of the Test
teams except Bangladesh and Zimbabwe so it's just nice to be
playing against the best in the world."


Rows between rival organisations battling for control of Kenyan
cricket haven't helped while pay disputes and the conviction for
match-fixing of former captain Maurice Odumbe have also set back
the Africans' cause.


Cricket Kenya took sole charge in April 2005 and Shah said: "To
be fair, probably a new association needs time to put things in
place so we're waiting to see how they go. We are positive about
our own ability, we have shown in the past we can perform."
