A Belarussian cargo plane crashed Friday shortly after taking off
from Mogadishu International Airport, an airport security
official told AFP.


"I confirm to you that this plane has crashed after taking off
from the airport, but we are not sure of the cause of the crash,"
said the official, Abdiwelli Said.


A Mogadishu resident said a plane had crashed in the capital's
northern Karan neigbourhood.


"We have a seen a huge plane with smoke coming out of it. The
plane was going down. We heard an explosion before we saw the
smoke, but we are not sure if the plane was gunned down," said
Mohamed Haji, a resident of Karan.


The plane crashed near a former flour mill, he added.


The airport official said it was a Belarussian cargo plane which
had brought engineers and equipment to Mogadishu to repair
another, an Ilyushin-76 chartered by the African Union, which
caught fire on landing there two weeks ago.


Belarus's transport ministry confirmed last week that the
Ilyushin had been hit by a rocket and seriously damaged while
landing in the Somali capital.


Islamist fighters opposed to the Ethiopian-backed Somali
government and to African Union peacekeepers being brought into
the country claimed responsibility for the attack.


Mogadishu has this week seen some of the heaviest fighting since
the government and its Ethiopian allies drove out the Islamists
from Mogadishu three months ago.
