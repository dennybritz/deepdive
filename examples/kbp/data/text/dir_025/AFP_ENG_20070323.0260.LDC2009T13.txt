Pakistan's outgoing cricket chief on Friday said the national
team were not suspects in the murder of coach Bob Woolmer and
suggested the players may themselves be under threat.


Naseem Ashraf, who offered his resignation as Pakistan Cricket
Board chairman this week, said there were no restrictions on the
players' movements, but that they had been moved to a "secure
environment" in Montego Bay "because we were worried about their
safety" following Woolmer's death.


"Our main worry and interest at this time is to focus attention
on their safety and get them home to their families as soon as
possible," he said.


A senior Jamaican police officer said Friday that investigators
think it likely that Woolmer was strangled in his hotel room by
someone he knew after his team's defeat at cricket's showpiece.


"No, there is no suspicion on the Pakistan team. This is
ridiculous," Ashraf told AFP.


"The Pakistani team were at the hotel like everyone else they
gave their statements, they were never interrogated.


"The whole team is under a lot of trauma and stress."


Pakistan's players gave statements to police and were
fingerprinted before leaving for Montego Bay, where they were to
stay for two days before returning home.
