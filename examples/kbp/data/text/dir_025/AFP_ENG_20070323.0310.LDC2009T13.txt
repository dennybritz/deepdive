The White House on Friday denounced a double bomb attack in
Baghdad that wounded Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi
and killed nine other people, including his brother.


"It's another completely reprehensible act. It demonstrates that
there are some terrorists who will do whatever they can to
disrupt things," said White House spokesman Tony Snow.


"We don't know who's responsible, but we do know that it does,
once again, reaffirm the importance of having a focused
commitment to Baghdad and elsewhere in building the conditions
for peace," he told reporters.
