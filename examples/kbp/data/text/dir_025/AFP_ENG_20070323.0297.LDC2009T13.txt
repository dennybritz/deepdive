Fighting between Democratic Republic of Congo troops and guards
of opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba has killed at least seven
people in the past two days, UN-sponsored Radio Okapi reported
Friday.


According to the radio, a woman and her child were killed when a
shell hit a residence in Bandalungwa, a neighborhood in the
northeast of the capital.


Citing hospital sources around Kinshasa, the radio reported five
other deaths and several wounded, some seriously.


The head of the capital's General Hospital, Dieudonne Diabeno,
could not confirm any dead to AFP but said there were some 10
wounded, including three soldiers in serious condition.


A Western security official said he had seen "four or five"
bodies of Bemba loyalists near his home in the Gombe district,
while the spokesman for the UN mission in the country (MONUC),
Lieutenant-Colonel Didier Rancher, said "many" wounded were being
evacuated.


In Paris foreign ministry spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei said two
French nationals had been wounded by stray bullets but their
lives were not in danger.


Earlier reports said two people had also been hurt when a shell
struck a building across the River Congo in Brazzaville, capital
of the neighbouring Congo republic.


On Thursday a Belgian national was also said to have been wounded
soon after the violence broke out.
