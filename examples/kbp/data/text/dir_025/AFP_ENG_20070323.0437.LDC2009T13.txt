Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel Tunnel linking France and
Britain, said Friday it expected an 11.35 percent fall in sales
this year following the abolition of a "minimum use charge" on
rail companies.


In a statement to French financial markets regulator AMF,
Eurotunnel forecast sales of 735.8 million euros (979 million
dollars) in 2007 after 830 million in 2006.


The forecast presented to the AMF serves as a basis for a
safeguard plan for Eurotunnel that received backing by a court in
January and is designed to help the group get out from under a
9.0-billion-euro debt burden.


Eurotunnel in early March said it had stemmed losses last year
after a catastrophic 12 months in 2005.


The group said it made a loss of 204 million euros in 2006
compared with a loss of 2.808 billion euros in 2005, while
operating profit increased by 42 percent to 326 million euros in
2006.


But Eurotunnel foresees operating profit slipping to 241.1
million euros this year, 246 million in 2008 and 265.6 million in
2009.


The operator said the expected drop in sales in 2007 was
partially attributable to the cancellation in late 2006 of a
"minimum use charge" on rail companies using the tunnel.


The fee had been worth 100 million euros a year to Eurotunnel,
which predicted sales of 751.5 million euros in 2008 and 777.3
million in 2009.
