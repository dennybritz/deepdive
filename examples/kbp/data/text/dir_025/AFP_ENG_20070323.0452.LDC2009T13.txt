British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett on Friday demanded the
immediate release of 15 sailors detained by Iran in the Gulf, and
a "full explanation" of what happened.


"We have sought a full explanation of what happened and we are
leaving them in no doubt that we want the immediate and safe
return of our personnel and their equipment," she said in a
televised statement.
