Some 77 percent of French parents would encourage their children
to become civil servants if that is the job they aspired to,
according to a survey to be released next week.


An even higher percentage of French white collar workers (86
percent) and blue collar workers (80 percent) look favorably on a
career in the civil service for their children, according to the
Ipsos survey to be released on Monday.


Some 84 percent of young parents between the ages of 18 and 35
also said they would support their child's decision to devote
themselves to public service.


But trade workers, business and shop owners and senior managers
are less sanguine about the idea, the poll showing the figure
among that group at 64 percent.


A total of 52 percent of those surveyed believe French public
services are better than those elsewhere in Europe, compared to
25 percent who see them as worse. Five percent said they were
neither.


Some 29 percent of those polled believe that an overhaul of the
public service should be a priority for the new president who
will be elected in the April and May votes.


The poll was carried out on March 2 and 3 among a representative
sampling of 950 people.
