The White House said Friday that some 15 British sailors held by
Iran had been involved in "routine" inspections in Iraqi waters
and that Washington was closely watching the situation.


"They were engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant
shipping in Iraqi territorial waters," said spokesman Tony Snow.
"We're keeping watch on the situation."


Snow said the sailors "were moved into Iranian waters" and, when
asked how the United States was responding, stressed "at this
point, what we're doing is staying in touch with the Brits."


Britain's Ministry of Defense said that the sailors were seized
by Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf on Friday. It demanded their
immediate release and sought urgent clarification from Tehran.


And Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett summoned the Iranian
ambassador over the incident, which comes amid mounting tension
between the Islamic republic and the West over Tehran's nuclear
plans.


"The British government is demanding the immediate and safe
return of our people and equipment," the ministry said,
underlining that the sailors had been engaged in "routine" anti-
smuggling operations in Iraqi waters.


The abduction of the British servicemen came as the United
Nations Security Council prepared to vote on new sanctions aimed
at forcing Tehran to curb its nuclear program.
