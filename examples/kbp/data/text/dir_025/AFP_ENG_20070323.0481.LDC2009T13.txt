Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said on Friday he was unconcerned by
media speculation that he will be sacked if the world champions
fail to qualify for the 2008 European Championships.


"I'm calm and not particularly stressed," said the 43-year-old
former AC Milan midfielder ahead of next Wednesday's delicate
Group B qualifying match against Scotland in Bari, southern
Italy.


"To tell you the truth the people around me are more stressed. My
only concern is to make sure the squad is hungry and determined.


"I'm not interested about anything else - including talk about my
job."


Italy are third in Group B on seven points, two behind France -
whom they beat in a penalty shootout in the World Cup final - and
Scotland, after four matches played.


While Italy have a free weekend, France and Scotland play on
Saturday against Lithuania and Georgia respectively, and
victories for the top two will leave the Azzurri five points
adrift come Wednesday, heaping more pressure on them and
Donadoni.


The top two in the group will qualify for next year's tournament
in Austria and Switzerland.


Donadoni, who replaced Marcello Lippi as Italy coach shortly
after their triumphant World Cup campaign last year, trimmed his
squad for the Scotland match from 25 to 21 on Friday.


Goalkeeper Marco Amelia, defenders Manuel Pasqual and Daniele
Bonera, and midfielder Franco Semioli were sent home from Italy's
training camp in Coverciano, Florence.


Roma midfielder Simone Perrotta sat out training due to a right
leg injury,  but Donadoni said it was not serious.
