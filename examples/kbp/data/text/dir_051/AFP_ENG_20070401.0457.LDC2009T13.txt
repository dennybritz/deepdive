A strong 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit near the Solomon Islands
early Monday, seismologists said.


The quake struck at 7:40 am local time (2040 GMT Sunday) and was
centred about 350 kilometres (220 miles) west-northwest of the
capital Honiara at a depth of 10 kilometres, the US Geological
Survey and Hong Kong Observatory said.
