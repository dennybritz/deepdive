Australian Adam Scott held off countryman Stuart Appleby to win
the 5.5 million dollar PGA Houston Open by three strokes and
capture his fifth career title on Sunday.


The 26-year-old Scott closed out the victory by nailing a 48-foot
putt on the final hole to finish with a six-under 66.


He regained the lead with four holes to play and took a one-shot
lead into the final hole.


But Scott hooked his tee shot on 18 into the water opening the
door for defending champ Appleby to possibly get into a playoff.


Appleby's chances disappeared when he landed in the sand off the
18th tee then followed Scott into the water with his second shot.


Scott, who has two wins in his last six starts, heads to next
week's Masters in a positive frame of mind.


Most of the top players have chosen to practice their way into
form leading up to The Masters.


Tiger Woods, defending Masters champion Phil Mickelson, South
African Ernie Els and three-time Houston Open champion Vijay
Singh of Fiji all are took the week off in preparation for the
first major of the year, which starts Thursday at Augusta
National.
