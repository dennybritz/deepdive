China's Chongqing City Commercial Bank has received government
approval to sell a 17-percent stake to Hong Kong's Dah Sing Bank,
the Chinese lender said Monday.


The bank, located in southwest China, is still awaiting for
approval to sell another 7.99 percent stake to US private equity
firm Carlyle Group, bank spokesman Huang Changsheng told AFP.


China's city commercial banks and regional banks are encouraged
by the government to attract foreign strategic investors to boost
their capital base and learn from their advanced management
experience.


Under a deal announced in December, Dah Sing Bank will buy 17
percent of Chongqing Commercial for 171.7 million yuan (22
million dollars) while Carlyle will pay 80.7 million yuan (10.4
million dollars) for a 7.99 percent stake.


"The banking regulatory body has approved our stake sale to Dah
Sing. They are working on approval documents and there wouldn't
be any problem that we will get them soon," Huang said.


"The approval was for our deal with Dah Sing alone. They are
still going through the stake sale to Carlyle," he added.


China caps total foreign investment in a domestic bank at 25
percent and a single foreign investor may hold no more than 20
percent.
