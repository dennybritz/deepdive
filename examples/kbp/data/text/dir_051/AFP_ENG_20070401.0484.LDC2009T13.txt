A tsunami swept ashore causing damage to towns and villages in
the Solomon Islands Monday following a powerful earthquake but
there were no early reports of casualties, police said.


The tsunami followed after a powerful earthquake with a magnitude
of 7.6 struck in the New Georgia Islands region, which had
prompted the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre to issue a tsunami
warning.


Solomons police spokesman Mick Spinks said there has been sketchy
reports of damage caused by a tsunami in areas near the quake.


"There have been no reports of casualties yet but you have to
bear in mind the communications with many areas is poor," Spinks
said.
