At least six people were killed and many others were missing
after a huge undersea earthquake off the Solomon Islands on
Monday, chief government spokesman Alfred Maesulia told CNN.


He also said the quake, and a tsunami which followed, had caused
millions of dollars worth of damage around Gizo, a popular
tourist and diving destination in the South Pacific nation.


"In some coastal villages, waves of up to 10 metres (33 feet)
high swept those villages and destroyed houses and properties,"
said Maesulia.


Earlier police spokesman Mick Spinks said unconfirmed reports
indicated at least four people were dead.
