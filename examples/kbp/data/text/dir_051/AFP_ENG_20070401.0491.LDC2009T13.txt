Washington Wizards All-Star forward Caron Butler broke his wrist
in a victory over Milwaukee Sunday and could be sidelined through
the National Basketball Association playoffs.


The loss of Butler was a high price for a 121-107 victory over
the Bucks.


The 27-year-old said he could be sidelined for the rest of the
regular season and possibly all of the playoffs, which begin in
less than three weeks.


Washington is 39-33, one-half game ahead of Miami in the
Southeast Division with just 10 games remaining.


Butler is averaging 19.1 points and 7.5 rebounds this season. He
had 19 points on 7-of-12 shooting when he slammed his wrist on
the backboard with 6:28 remaining in the third quarter.


The Wizards are just 2-8 this season without Butler, who has sat
out with various ailments, including a sore knee.
