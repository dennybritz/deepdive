Brazil's Helio Castroneves won the Indy-Car Series Grand Prix of
St. Petersburg for the second straight year here Sunday.


The Miami-based driver defeated New Zealand's Scott Dixon, with
fellow Brazilian Tony Kanaan - who spun on the first lap and had
to work his way back from 16th - third.


Marco Andretti and Scotland's Dario Franchitti rounded out the
top five.


Castroneves dominated throughout, leading all but five laps in
the 100-lap race through the streets of St. Petersburg to capture
his sixth career victory from the pole.


England's Dan Wheldon, who won last week's season opener at
Homestead-Miami, finished sixth.


Dixon, who was runner-up for the second week in a row, took the
lead in the standings with 80 points, followed by Castroneves and
Wheldon, both with 75.
