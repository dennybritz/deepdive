US President George W. Bush said early Monday that a free trade
agreement between the United States and South Korea will "further
enhance" the bilateral partnerhsip.


The statement was contained in a formal notification to Congress,
in which the president informed lawmakers of his intention to
enter into such a deal.


"The United States-Korea free trade agreement ... will generate
export opportunities for US farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and
service suppliers, promote economic growth and the creation of
better paying jobs in the United States, and help American
consumers save money while offering them greater choices," Bush
said in a letter to leaders of the Senate and the House of
Representatives.


"The agreement will also further enhance the strong United
States-Korea partnership, which has served as a force for
stability and prosperity in Asia."
