Senegal's 80-year-old President Abdoulaye Wade is due to be sworn
in on Tuesday in grand style in the presence of around 20 other
African heads of state following his February 25 re-election.


Wade, a lawyer by training who spent a quarter of a century in
opposition before coming to power in 2000, saw off 14 other
candidates to win a second term in February with 56 percent of
the vote.


The country's highest electoral court dismissed allegations of
irregularities from two of the other candidates, third placed
Ousmane Tanor Dieng, candidate of the former ruling Socialist
Party, and sixth placed Abdoulaye Bathily.


International monitors noted irregularities but said they were
not serious enough to affect the outcome and declared the
election free and transparent in the only country in west Africa
never to have experienced a coup d'etat.


None of the other candidates scored more than 15 percent of the
vote, but the opposition is hoping for a better performance in
parliamentary elections on June 3.


Organisers of Tuesday's inauguration expect around 60,000 people
to pack out the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium, named after the
former French colony's first post-independence president.


Notable attendees will include the heads of state from countries
including South Africa, Sudan, Libya, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Mali, Sierra Leone and Chad.


To mark the occasion, and because it falls close to Senegal's
April 4 national holiday, Wade has declared three extra days of
paid holiday for the nation's 11 million inhabitants.
