A Pacific-wide tsunami warning following a powerful earthquake
early Monday off the Solomons Islands has been lifted, the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said.


"For all areas the tsunami warning and tsunami watch are
cancelled," the Hawai- based centre said, hours after the 8.0
magnitude undersea triggered a tsunami that hit the Solomons.


The centre said there had been reports of tsunami-related deaths
in the Solomon Islands, where authorities have reported six
people dead, as well as Papua New Guinea.
