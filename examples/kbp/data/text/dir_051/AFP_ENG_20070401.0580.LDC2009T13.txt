A moderate earthquake measuring 5.5 hit a mountainous region of
southern Chile late Sunday, the US government said. But there
were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.


The epicenter of the tremor that occurred at 22:49 pm (0249 GMT
Monday) was located 28 kilometers (18 miles) from Puerto Aisen,
according to the US Geological Survey.


The reading was based on the open-ended Moment Magnitude scale,
now used by US seismologists, which measures the area of the
fault that ruptured and the total energy released.
