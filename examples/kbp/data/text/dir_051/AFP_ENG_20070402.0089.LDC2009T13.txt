The Turkish economy was stronger than forecast last year, growing
by 6.0 percent instead of a previously expected 5.0 percent, the
Turkish statistics institute said Monday.


Fourth quarter growth was only 4.6 percent but a robust expansion
of 7.5 percent in the first half of the year made up the
difference, allowing the government to exceed its target, the
institute added.


Turkey's economy is one of the strongest in the region, having
grown by 5.9 percent in 2003, 9.9 percent in 2004 and 7.6 percent
in 2005.


In February 2005, Ankara successfully terminated for the first
time an economic restructuring programme established with the
International Monetary Fund, ending a string of 17 failed
attempts.


The IMF had granted Turkey 16 billion dollars in financial
assistance following an economic crisis in 2001.


A second, three-year stand-by agreement for 10 billion dollars
signed in 2005 is expected to permit the country to complete the
restructuring of its economy.
