Australian share prices fell 1.32 percent Monday after investor
sentiment was rattled by speculation the central bank will raise
interest rates this week, dealers said.


The benchmark SP/ASX 200 shed 79.2 points to close at the day's
low of 5,915.8 while the broader All Ordinaries slipped 70.6
points to 5,908.2.
