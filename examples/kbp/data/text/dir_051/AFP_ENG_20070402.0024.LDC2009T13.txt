A Pacific-wide tsunami warning following a powerful earthquake
early Monday off the Solomons Islands has been lifted, the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said.


"For all areas the tsunami warning and tsunami watch are
cancelled," the Hawai- based centre said, hours after the 8.0
magnitude undersea triggered a tsunami that hit the Solomons.


The centre said there had been reports of tsunami-related deaths
in the Solomon Islands, where authorities have reported six
people dead, as well as Papua New Guinea.


"When no major waves are observed for two hours after the
estimated time of arrival, or damaging waves have not ocurred for
at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat
is passed," it said.


It said there could still be danger to boats and coastal
structures in the immediate area.


"No tsunami threat exists for other coastal areas in the Pacific
although some other areas may experience small sea level
changes."


The quake struck at 7:40 am local time (2040 GMT Sunday) centred
about 350 kilometres (220 miles) west-northwest of the capital
Honiara at a depth of 10 kilometres, the US Geological Survey and
Hong Kong Observatory said.
