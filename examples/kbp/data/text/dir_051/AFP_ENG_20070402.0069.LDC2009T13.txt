A woman has won a contested election for the first time to the
only municipal council in the gas-rich Gulf state of Qatar,
according to results from the weekend poll.


Shaikha Yussef al-Jiffri, was among three women out of 118
candidates running for 29 council seats on Sunday in only the
third local election in the emirate, interior ministry spokesman
Rashed al-Atiq said.


Jiffri was a member of the outgoing council  -- the sole local
government in the tiny country -- but had been returned unopposed
after the other two candidates in her constituency stood down in
the last vote in 2003.


Atiq said turnout on Sunday was 50.1 percent of the 28,000
registered voters, with the municipal poll failing to stir
enthusiasm ahead of the country's first partial legislative
election expected later this year.


Qatar has an indigenous population of 174,000 out of a total of
750,000 inhabitants.
