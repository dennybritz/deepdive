A knife-wielding Chinese tour guide wounded 20 people, including
15 tourists, in a rampage in the world-renowned scenic southern
mountain town of Lijiang, state media reported on Monday.


The multiple stabbings occurred on Sunday and left two of the
victims in serious conditions, Xinhua news agency said.


The male suspect, identified as Xu Minchao, a tour group operator
from the northern Chinese province of Jilin, was arrested at the
scene and was being interrogated, it said.


The report gave no details on Xu's possible motives. It said the
tourists were all from China.


A UN World Heritage Site, Lijiang draws large numbers of tourists
from China and around the world who come to see its historic
cobblestoned "old town" district and dramatic mountain scenery.
