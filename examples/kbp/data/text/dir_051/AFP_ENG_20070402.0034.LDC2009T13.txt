Military-run Myanmar slaughtered thousands of fowl last week amid
fears the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus was spreading in the
nation's biggest city, Yangon, state media said Monday.


Some 6,600 birds were slaughtered in the northern outskirts of
Yangon after lab tests detected a possible outbreak of the virus
on a farm in Mingaladon Township, the official New Light of
Myanmar said.


The birds were killed as a preventive measure, even though lab
tests have yet to confirm whether the deadly virus had actually
hit the farm, the paper said.


So far, five outbreaks of bird flu have been confirmed around
Yangon since February 28. Myanmar has culled about 38,000 birds
since then.


No human cases of the disease have been reported, Kyaw Nyunt
Sein, deputy director general of the health ministry, told AFP,
although some 1,100 people have been tested.


Authorities say that the scale of the problem in Yangon is
smaller than the outbreak that hit the central city of Mandalay
one year ago. Some 660,000 birds were slaughtered to contain the
virus last year.


The World Health Organisation says the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu has infected at least 282 people and killed at least 169 of
them, mostly in Southeast Asia, since the end of 2003.


The UN's agricultural agency has praised Myanmar's normally
secretive government for its response to new outbreaks, and is
providing 1.4 million dollars in assistance to help fight the
disease.
