More than 15 people were killed in the area of the Solomon
Islands closest to the epicentre of an earthquake that triggered
a tsunami on Monday, a provincial leader said citing reports.


"Reports have come in that more than 15 people died, just around
Gizo, but with the other islands I cannot tell you," Western
Province premier Alex Lokopio told Radio New Zealand.


He did not provide any further details of the deaths but said
there was a desperate need for emergency supplies in the affected
area following the tsunami, which followed a 8.0 magnitude
earthquake centred under the sea just 45 kilometres (28 miles)
from Gizo.


"What we desperately need now is water, tents, and food because
almost 3,000-4,000 people are now living on the hill at Gizo,"
Lokopio said.


The residents of the town were still fearful as aftershocks
continued to rock the area.


He said there was no warning of the tsunami which hit just
minutes after the area was rocked by the initial quake at 7:40 am
local time (2040 GMT Sunday).


"There wasn't any warning (of the tsunami). This was a very sad
thing because the warning was the earth tremors. It shook us
very, very strongly and we were frightened.


"All of a sudden the sea was rising up so all the people living
around the coastal area, they ran up on the hill."


He said most of the government buildings and businesses in the
town were destroyed, along with houses in low-lying areas.


Millions of dollars would be needed to repair the damage caused
by the tsunami and quake, Lokopio said.
