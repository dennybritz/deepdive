At least three people died Monday after a tsunami hit the Solomon
Islands following a powerful earthquake, Japanese public
broadcaster NHK reported, quoting a local official in the
affected area.


"This morning when we were arranging to go to work, (a) very
strong earthquake hit this island with tidal waves, tsunami, and
destroyed all the houses along the coastal area," the chief of
the Solomons western district told NHK.


"I think it was more than five meters (high). They found three
people dead in different locations," the official said in a
telephone interview with NHK, which did not give his name.


The US Geological Survey meanwhile upgraded its estimate of the
quake to a magnitude of 8.0, from an earlier reading of 7.6. The
quake prompted an immediate warning from the Pacific Tsunami
Warning Centre.


Japan's meteorological agency, which estimated the quake's
magnitude at 8.1, also issued a tsunami advisory to countries in
the northwestern Pacific region, ranging from the Russian Far
East to the Fiji islands.


"We are now looking into the possibility of tidal waves hitting
the Japanese archipelago," an agency official said.
