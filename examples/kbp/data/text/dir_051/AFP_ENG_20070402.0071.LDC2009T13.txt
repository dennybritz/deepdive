At least five people were killed and another 20 wounded when a
bus exploded in eastern Sri Lanka Monday, police said.


The vehicle was near a military check point in the district of
Ampara when the blast occurred, a police official in the area
said by telephone.


"Five have died on the spot and another 20 were taken to the
Ampara hospital," the official said, adding that it was not
immediately clear if the bus had been hit by a bomb or a mine.
