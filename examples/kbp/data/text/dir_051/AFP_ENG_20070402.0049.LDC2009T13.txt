China should avoid further steep growth in its forex reserves and
keep only 650 billion dollars for security purposes, state media
said Monday, citing a senior legislator.


Just 450 billion dollars are needed as strategic reserves, said
Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the standing committee of the
National People's Congress, China's parliament, according to the
China Securities Journal.


Strategic reserves refer to the portion of a country's forex
reserves sufficient to pay for three months of imports and ensure
economic stability, according to the paper.


Another 200 billion dollars are needed to fund the overseas
investment strategies of corporations and meet Chinese citizens'
needs, Cheng added.


He said that to temper the growth of forex reserves, the country
should  tighten curbs on hot money inflows, expand overseas
purchases and lift restrictions on access to foreign exchange by
corporations and individuals.


China's forex reserves, the world's largest, hit 1.07 trillion
dollars by the end of 2006.


As part of its efforts to maximise returns, the government is
preparing to set up a state-controlled investment firm, which
will reportedly manage a fifth of the forex reserves.
