Several villages in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific were
completely destroyed by a tsunami on Monday, the chairman of the
National Disaster Council said.


"Some villages are completely wiped out," Fred Fakari told
journalists in the capital Honiara.


He said there had been unconfirmed reports of two deaths but that
information on the extent of the damage caused by the tsunami,
which followed a powerful 8.0 magnitude earthquake, remained
sketchy.


The disaster council decided not to declare a state of emergency
following a meeting because of the lack of information, Fakari
said.


The council was to meet again later Monday to reassess the
situation, he added.


Phone lines and electricity were down in the Western Province
capital of Gizo, which was just 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the
centre of the quake, hampering efforts to find out the extent of
the damage.


There was still no idea about damage or casualties in more
isolated areas in the west, he said. A Solomons government patrol
boat was being sent from Honiara Monday to assess the situation.


The tsunami pounded the west of the country, inundating Gizo and
villages in the region, local reports said.


The quake struck at 7:40 am local time (2040 GMT Sunday) and was
centred about 350 kilometres (220 miles) west-northwest of the
capital Honiara at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 miles), the US
Geological Survey said.


A series of aftershocks, with a magnitude of up to 6.7 continued
to rock the area during the day.
