South Korea's exports grew at a double-digit rate for the 14th
straight month in March, fuelled by strong overseas demand for
semiconductors, ships, petrochemicals and steel, a government
report said Monday.


Exports rose 14 percent year-on-year to 30.6 billion dollars last
month,  the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy said. In
February, exports had increased 11.3 percent from February 2006
to 26.4 billion dollars.


March imports were up 12.1 percent year-on-year to 29.1 billion
dollars, the ministry report said, giving a trade surplus of 1.5
billion dollars.


Exports of semiconductors rose 20.4 percent from a year earlier,
while petrochemicals and ships increased 28.9 percent and 39.0
percent, respectively.


US and South Korean negotiators were Monday in the last stages of
talks on a proposed free trade agreement. If approved, this is
expected to increase both countries' overseas sales by billions
of dollars.
