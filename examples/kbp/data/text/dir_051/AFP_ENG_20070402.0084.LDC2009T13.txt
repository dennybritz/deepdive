Chinese share prices closed 2.15 percent higher on follow-through
buying, with financials and steelmakers leading another record
breaking performance, dealers said.


They said investors found support on expectations for solid
corporate earnings after China's largest steelmakers, Baosteel,
reported a three percent increase in 2006 net profit.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, jumped 68.61
points to 3,252.60 points, a new high. Turnover rose to 93.30
billion yuan (12 billion dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 72.38 points or 2.16 percent to
3,418.73 on turnover of 92.97 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index added 20.10 points or 2.33 percent at 881.88,
another record, on turnover of 46.70 billion yuan.
