South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun and visiting Austrian
President Heinz Fischer were to hold talks later Monday with the
focus on expanding trade, Roh's office said.


It said talks, due to begin at about 3:30 pm (0630 GMT), would
focus on ways to increase economic and commercial exchanges, as
well as issues concerning the European Union and the Korean
peninsula.


Roh and Fischer were expected to adopt a joint declaration on
cooperation in science and technology and hold a joint press
conference.


Fischer arrived Sunday for a four-day state visit, the first
Austrian head of state to visit South Korea since diplomatic ties
were established in 1963.


The Austrian president, who is accompanied by about 50 business
leaders, will also tour the inter-Korean border village of
Panmunjom, visit Korean industrial plants and meet local business
leaders.
