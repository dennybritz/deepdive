Several explosions were heard early Monday near a Dutch court
where the trial of an alleged underworld boss and his accomplices
was due to start later in the day, ANP news agency reported.


A police spokesman told ANP that several blasts were heard near
the high security court in Osdorp, a southwestern suburb of
Amsterdam. Several courthouse windows were broken.


The trial of Willem Holleeder -- alleged to be the kingpin of an
Amsterdam gang that blackmailed four businessmen and stands
accused of murdering one of them -- and five co-defendants was
due to start later Monday.


Holleeder was arrested in January 2005 along with his alleged
accomplices. A verdict is expected at the end of June.
