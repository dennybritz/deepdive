Residents of the Solomons capital Honiara ran into the streets
screaming Monday after a massive earthquake triggered a tsunami
in the west of the archipelago, one witness told AFP.


But the panic in the Pacific Island nation -- where people live
in constant fear of tsunamis -- was shortlived, with the
situation returning to normal within 30 minutes, Australian
lawyer Daniel Evans said.


"There was a period when everyone started to run. I just saw
everyone on the street start to run and scream. But people are
just back to normal now," Evans, who is working in the Solomons,
told AFP by telephone.


"People are down along the shoreline looking at the water but
everyone's fine. No one is panicking."


News of the tsunami had been carried on local radio here but
there had been no indication that people should evacuate the
city, he added.


The tsunami, triggered by a powerful 8.0 magnitude earthquake,
swept into areas of the country's remote western province Monday,
inundating villages and leaving several people missing or dead,
officials and locals said.
