West Indies captain Brian Lara admitted on Sunday that the
gruelling World Cup schedule had left his team jaded and figthing
for their lives in the tournament.


West Indies slumped to a 113-run defeat to Sri Lanka at
Providence here, their third defeat in three Super Eights matches
to deal a probable fatal blow to their hopes of reaching the
semi-finals.


"It was very tough today," said Lara after his side failed
miserably to chase the target of 304 to win.


"But this was our fourth match in 10 days and you could see that
some of the guys were really flat in the field.


"(Fast bowler) Daren Powell has lost 10kg in the last few days.
It's all very unfortunate but now we have to pick ourselves up
and try and win the next three matches.


"You never know what can happen in this World Cup."


West Indies now have a nine-day interval before they play their
next Super Eights match against South Africa in Grenada before
going on to face Bangladesh and England in Barbados.


Lara insisted his jaded team needs a rest.


"A lot of the guys will take a few days off and we will assess
the situation. We have to be sure we are fresh for the last three
matches."
