French far-right presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen on
Monday joined in the broad condemnation from political leaders of
a weekend attack on Jewish gravestones in the northern city of
Lille.


Le Pen described the desecration of some 50 tombstones in the
Jewish section of the Lille cemetery at the weekend as a "hateful
act" and noted that it was a "recurring event" during election
campaigns.


"Attacking cemeteries, of whatever religion, is unbearable and
stupid," said Le Pen in an interview to France Info radio.


President Jacques Chirac on Sunday ordered the government "to do
everything possible to find the perpetrators of this infamy so
that they are severely punished."


No graffiti was left on the 51 tombstones in the attack overnight
Saturday to Sunday but "many were knocked down, some broken,"
said Lille prosecutor Philippe Lemaire.


On Sunday, many Jewish families had gathered at the Lille-Sud
cemetery to assess the damage, visible along a long row of
tombstones that were attacked on the eve of the Passover holiday.


The mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, described the attack as a
"hateful anti- Semitic act" while the prosecutor said there had
never been vandalism on such a scale in the region.


The prosecutor warned that the perpetrators could face between
three to five years in prison while some 40 police investigators
were put on the case.


France has one of the biggest Jewish communities in the world,
estimated at up to 600,000 people.
