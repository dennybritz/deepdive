Japanese share prices closed down 1.50 percent on Monday,
reversing early gains as investors remained nervous about the
outlook for the US economy, dealers said.


They said that a drop in Japanese business confidence did little
to lift the market's mood, with sentiment among major
manufacturers down for the first time in one year, according to a
central bank report.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 259.24 points to 17,028.41, after briefly dipping below the
key 17,000 points level.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section shed 31.12 points or 1.82 percent to 1,682.49.
