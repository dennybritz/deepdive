US telecommunications giant AT&T said Sunday it was in
negotiations for a potential indirect investment in Telecom
Italia.


The company statement said the proposal is for AT&T to
purchase a one-third stake in Olimpia, a holding company that
owns approximately 18 percent of Telecom Italia.


As part of these negotiations, America Movil also is considering
an investment for one-third of the shares of Olimpia.


AT&T's investment is contingent on America Movil's
investment.


AT&T is in negotiations on the potential investment to
acquire the interest from Pirelli, which owns 80 percent of
Olimpia.


Olimpia holds only Telecom Italia assets.


"The valuation of the stakes in Olimpia which are the object of
the possible sale would be based on a price per Telecom Italia
share equal to euro 2.82, minus the net debt of Olimpia on the
closing date of the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of
the terms of the proposal," the statement said.
