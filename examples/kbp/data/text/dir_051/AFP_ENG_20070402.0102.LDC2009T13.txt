Top scientists began a closed-doors meeting under the UN banner
here Monday that will culminate in a massive report on the
impacts of climate change.


The 1,400-page document will be issued on Friday by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) along with a key
"summary for policymakers".


It will list the shifts that have been seen in Earth's climate
system in the past decades as a result of global warming and make
predictions about further changes this century.
