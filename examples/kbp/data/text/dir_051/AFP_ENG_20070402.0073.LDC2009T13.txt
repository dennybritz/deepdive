A second powerful earthquake is likely to hit the Solomon Islands
within days following a magnitude 8.0 tremor early Monday, a
leading Australian seismologist said.


Professor Kevin McCue, director of the Australian Seismological
Centre, said historical evidence suggested that a major
earthquake was usually followed by another of similar magnitude.


"We should be aware that there is a better than 50-50 chance that
there'll be another magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the Solomon
Islands in the next few hours to the next few weeks," he told
Australian Associated Press.


"This happened in 1971, 1973, 1974 and 1977, so we have a good
track record of this kind of thing happening," said McCue, who
previously headed the earthquake hazard programme at Geoscience
Australia.


A powerful 8.0 magnitude quake hit the Solomon Islands early
Monday, triggering a wall of water which swamped towns, flattened
houses and washed away buildings in the west of the archipelago.
