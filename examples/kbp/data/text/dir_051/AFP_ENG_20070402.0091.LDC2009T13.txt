The formation of gas producers' cartel is not imminent even
though the world's leading natural gas exporters are interested
in forming such a club, Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev
said Monday in an interview published in Spain.


"We talk about this, and amongst gas producing countries the
desire exists for it but I believe we will not arrive at the
creation of a gas OPEC for the moment," he told daily newspaper
El Pais.


Some world media have reported that major gas exporting nations,
which include Russia, Iran, Qatar, Venezuela and Algeria, will
roll out a gas cartel similar to the one which exist for oil
producers when they meet in the Qatari capital of Doha on April
9.


Nazarbayev said Kazakhstan, which has huge oil and gas reserves,
would take part in the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, which is
normally a ceremonial event.


"Kazakhstan will take part in this summit. I recently visited
Doha and I spoke with the Emir. I don't believe Qatar predicts
the creation of a gas OPEC," he said.


Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei was the first to
float the idea of creating a gas cartel, saying Iran and Russia
had half the world's gas reserves and could establish an
organisation similar to the oil cartel OPEC.


The possible creation of a gas cartel worries nations, especially
in Europe, that are heavily reliant on gas imports.
