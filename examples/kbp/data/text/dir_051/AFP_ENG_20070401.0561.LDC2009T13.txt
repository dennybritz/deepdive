The Boston Celtics took advantage of the absence of Cavaliers
star LeBron James to edge Cleveland 98-96 Sunday in a National
Basketball Association contest.


Gerald Green scored 18 of his 25 points in the second half as the
Celtics held on for the victory.


Al Jefferson scored 18 points and Ryan Gomes added 17 for the
Celtics, who improved to just 3-23 without Paul Pierce. The star
swingman sat out with a sore left elbow, which also sidelined him
earlier this season.


With the score tied, Boston's Delonte West drove to the basket
and was tripped by Anderson Varejao in the lane with 1.9 seconds
left. West, who scored 11 points, made both free throws.


Cleveland's Damon Jones missed a wide open 3-pointer from the
right corner at the buzzer.


James sat out with tendinitis in his right knee and is day to
day. In his absence, Larry Hughes scored 24 points, making
12-of-12 free throws.


Zydrunas Ilgauskas added 14 points for the Cavaliers, who are
one-half game ahead of Chicago for second place in the Eastern
Conference. Cleveland fell four games behind Detroit for the top
spot in the East.
