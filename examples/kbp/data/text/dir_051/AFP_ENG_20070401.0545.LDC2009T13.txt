Japanese share prices rose 0.52 percent in morning trade Monday
as investors shrugged off the first decline in a year in a key
index of business confidence amid optimism about the overall
economy, dealers said.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
gained 89.52 points to hit 17,377.17 at the lunch break. The
broader TOPIX index of all first-section shares rose 3.58 points
or 0.21 percent to 1,717.19.
