Business confidence among Japan's major manufacturers fell back
from a two-year high over the three months to March, the first
decline for a year, the central bank reported Monday.


Confidence among Japan's big manufacturers dropped to 23 in March
from 25 in December, the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey
showed, below market expectations for a figure of 24.


A positive reading means that confident firms outweigh
pessimistic ones.
