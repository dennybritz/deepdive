Tickets for Glastonbury, the giant British music festival, sold
out in 105 minutes after fans swamped the event's booking line
and website, the organisers said Sunday.


The tickets went on sale at 9 am, and 137,500 tickets had been
sold by 10:45 am for the festival held in Pilton, Somerset,
southwestern Britain.


Demand was so heavy that the official festival website crashed
half an hour before the tickets were due to go on sale, as it
struggled with the number of people logging on.


Hundreds of thousands of interested revellers still missed out on
the 145-pound (214-euro, 285-dollar) tickets, though.


Back after a two-year absence, this year's festival on June 22-24
will be the biggest yet -- Arctic Monkey are to be one of the
headline acts at Glastonbury this year, while eccentric Icelandic
singer Bjork is also on the bill.
