The United States and South Korea reached a major free trade
agreement Monday after 10 months of tough negotiations, the US
Trade Representative's office said.


"We have a deal," Steven Norton, spokesman for the office, told
AFP.


Seoul's Yonhap news agency quoted an unidentified South Korean
official as saying the same.


YTN television said South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-Chong
reported the outcome of a marathon final negotiating session to
President Roh Moo-Hyun and secured his approval to accept the
deal.


There was no formal announcement as yet. Norton said a statement
would be issued in about one hour.
