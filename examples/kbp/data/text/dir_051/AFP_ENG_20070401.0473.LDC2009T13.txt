A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck in the
Solomon Islands Monday, prompting the Pacific Tsunami Warning
Centre to issue a tsunami warning.


"An earthquake of this size has the potential to generate a
destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near
the epicentre within minutes to hours," the warning centre said.


The warning covers the Solomons, Australia, Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea, Vanuatu, Nauru, Chuuk, New Caledonia, Pohnpei, Kosrae,
Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands.


The centre said it had no confirmed information a tsunami was
generated but said "authorities should take appropriate action in
response to this possibility."


A quake of a magnitude greater than six can trigger a tsunami.


The quake struck at 7:40 am local time (2040 GMT Sunday) and was
centred about 350 kilometres (220 miles) west-northwest of the
capital Honiara at a depth of 10 kilometres, the US Geological
Survey and Hong Kong Observatory said.


There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.


The Pacific nation, 2,575 kilometres east of Australia, has fewer
than 500,000 people living on dozens of islands.


It is part of the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where continental plates
meet and frequently experiences volcanic and seismic activity.
