The Asian Development Bank has to radically transform itself if
it wants to remain relevant in a rapidly changing Asia, a major
report on the future role of the ADB said Monday.


The report projects that by 2020, Asia will be dramatically
transformed into a region that has largely conquered extreme
poverty, one of the main reasons for the bank's existence.


It estimates that by 2020 less than 25 million of East Asia's
estimated two billion people will be living on less than a dollar
a day.


At the same time, 90 percent of the region's people will be
living in middle income countries, with its economy accounting
for 45 percent of global output and 35 percent of world trade.


ADB president Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday welcomed the report and
its findings.


"The report is both thoughtful and thought-provoking, and
provides us with invaluable insights that will help chart the
future course for ADB," he said.


A special pannel of eminent persons headed by Supachai
Panitchpakdi, Secretary General of the UN Conference on Trade and
Development, was set up last year to examine the trends and
challenges facing the region and how these will impact on the
Manila-based bank's future.


"To effectively carry out its role in a rapidly changing Asia,
the ADB must radically change itself and adopt new models of
development banking that allow it to be responsive to the
region's evolving needs between now and 2020," Supachai said in a
statement.
