A Chinese government think-tank has raised its forecast for
economic growth in the first quarter to around 11 percent, up
from a previous estimate of 10.2 percent, state media reported
Monday.


The expansion is being driven by rising domestic consumption and
exports, the International Financial News reported, citing a
report by the State Information Center, which comes under the
State Council or cabinet.


The think-thank estimated in February that the economy would grow
10.2 percent in the first quarter.


China is likely to see a fifth consecutive year of double-digit
growth in 2007, the central bank said in remarks published last
Friday, just weeks after the government called for a slowdown in
the economy.


The world's fourth-largest economy will probably expand by 10
percent this year, compared with 10.7 percent in 2006, according
to the central bank.


Its forecast for growth in the first quarter stood at 10.2
percent.


In a speech to lawmakers in March, Premier Wen Jiabao targeted
eight percent growth in 2007.


Analysts almost immediately characterised the target as
unrealistic, saying it was mainly meant as a signal to lower-
level officials to refrain from going for growth at any cost.
