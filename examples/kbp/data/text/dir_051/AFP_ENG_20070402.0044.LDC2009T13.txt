More than 15 people were killed in the area of the Solomon
Islands closest to the epicentre of an earthquake that triggered
a tsunami on Monday, a provincial leader said citing reports.


"Reports have come in that more than 15 people died, just around
Gizo, but with the other islands I cannot tell you," Western
Province premier Alex Lokopio told Radio New Zealand.


He did not provide any further details of the deaths but said
there was a desperate need for water, food and tents in the
affected area following the tsunami, which followed a 8.0
magnitude earthquake centred under the sea just 45 kilometres (28
miles) from Gizo.
