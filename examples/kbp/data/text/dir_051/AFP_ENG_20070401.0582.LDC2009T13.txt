At least four people died in a tsunami that struck the Solomon
Islands early Monday after a powerful undersea earthquake, police
said, citing initial reports.


Police spokesman Mick Spinks said the reports were yet to be
confirmed but that "we have had information that four people have
died."


He said they were a 12-year-old child and a woman in Gizo, a town
just 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the epicentre and capital of
Western Province, and two elderly men in nearby Choiseul
province.


Earlier, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK cited the chief of
the western district as saying three people had died.


The 8.0-magnitude quake triggered waves of three to five metres
(10 to 16.5 feet) high, witnesses said, with reports of entire
villages inundated.
