Chinese labour authorities have launched an investigation into
allegations that McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut
are underpaying local part-time workers, state media said Monday.


Labour officials in the southern province of Guangdong, where the
issue was first uncovered by local media, have broadened their
investigation from the provincial capital Guangzhou to the whole
province, the People's Daily said.


The Guangzhou-based New Express reported last week that
McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut had violated
labour laws by underpaying part-time workers by up to 40 percent.


McDonald's and Yum! Brands Inc, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut,
denied the allegation and affirmed they had always abided by
Chinese laws.


They have handed in employment details like salary scales and
employment contracts covering their 24,000 employees in the
province to the labour supervision authority in Guangzhou, the
People's Daily said.


The state-run All China Federation of Trade Unions has weighed in
to add pressure on the fast-food chains by claiming that it would
support lawsuits filed by employees if the allegations prove
correct.


"If there really are unlawful employment practices and they
refuse to correct their mistakes, the union will ... support
workers suing in court," Li Shouzhen of the federation said,
according to New Express.
