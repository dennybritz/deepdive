Mao Anqing, the last known son of Communist China's founder Mao
Zedong, was laid to rest in Beijing on Monday in a low-key
ceremony, state media reported.


Though never involved in politics, he was interred in a cemetery
in western Beijing for former revolutionary heroes and high
government officials, Xinhua news agency said.


The second child of Mao and his first wife Yang Kaihui, Mao
Anqing died on March 24 at the age of 84.


Hundreds of mourners, many dressed in military uniform, queued
quietly at the cemetery to pay their respects, Xinhua said.


Mao Anqing was born in central Hunan province in 1923. In 1933,
he was beaten by police in Shanghai, prompting life-long mental
illness, state media said earlier.


He and his elder brother Mao Anying were sent to Paris and Moscow
to escape the growing war with Japan and the civil war between
the communists and nationalists, returning to China in 1947.


Mao Anqing was given a titular post in a military research
institute but never entered politics. His brother was killed in
the 1950-1953 Korean War.


Mao Zedong, who died in 1976, also had two daughters, Li Na and
Li Min, by two other wives. They are both still believed to be
alive.


It has long been thought Mao Zedong had other children, but none
has ever been identified.
