At least three people died Monday after a tsunami hit the Solomon
Islands following a powerful earthquake, Japanese public
broadcaster NHK reported, quoting a local official in the
affected area.


"This morning when we were arranging to go to work, (a) very
strong earthquake hit this island with tidal waves, tsunami, and
destroyed all the houses along the coastal area," the official
told NHK.


"I think it was more than five meters (high). They found three
people dead in different locations," the official said.


The tsunami struck the Solomons coast after a powerful earthquake
with a magnitude of 7.6 struck in the New Georgia Islands region,
prompting the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre to issue a tsunami
warning.


The Japanese meteorological agency estimated the magnitude at
8.1.
