Chinese share prices rose 1.36 percent in morning trade Monday on
follow-through buying with financial and steelmakers in focus
amid another record breaking performance, dealers said.


They said investors found support on expectations for solid
corporate earnings after China's largest steelmakers, Baosteel,
reported a three percent increase in 2006 net profits compared
with a year ago.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
up 43.30 points at 3,227.28.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 45.70 points or 1.37 percent at
3,392.05 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was up 10.87 points or
1.26 percent at 872.65.


There was however some uncertainty after last week's run-up, with
the market trying to anticipate when authorities will launch
long-awaited index futures, a financial tool which could
initially increase market volatility.


"The market continued to perform strongly, supported by sustained
institutional buying in heavyweight stocks, especially financial
and steel issues, ahead of the launching of index futures," said
Wang Jun, an analyst at China Merchants Securities.


"Investors are also confident about the first quarter earnings of
listed companies, which are expected to see average growth of at
least 30 percent year- on-year."
