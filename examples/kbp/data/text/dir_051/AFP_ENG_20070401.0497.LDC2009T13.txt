Australia on Monday issued a tsunami alert for residents of its
northeast coast after a powerful 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit the
Solomon Islands, but said the wave posed little threat.


Geoscience Australia said while the tsunami posed no threat to
the far north of Queensland state, it could still wreak damage in
other areas of the Pacific.


The agency also upgraded its reading of the magnitude of the
temblor to 8.1 on the Richter scale, while the US Geological
Survey measured the quake at 7.6 on its scale.


A Geoscience Australia spokeswoman said the tsunami would be
between 10 and 20 centimeters (four to eight inches), posing
little threat to residents in isolated areas of Australia.


"It's not a really big (threat) for the coast of Australia," she
said.


Bureau of Meteorology spokesman Rob Webb said that while the
tsumani sounded small, it had so far only been measured in one
place and still had the potential to cause damage in the Pacific.


"It can act very differently in different locations," he said.
"It's quite a dangerous situation that we are monitoring very
closely -- 8.1 is enough to generate a tsumani across the
Pacific."


A tsunami battered the western edge of the Solomon Islands,
causing damage to towns and villages, officials said.


One local official quote by Japanese public broadcaster NHK said
three people had been killed. Another official told the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation there were unconfirmed
reports of up to nine missing.
