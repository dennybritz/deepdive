Indian share prices slumped as much as 2.65 percent on Monday
following a surprise central bank interest rate hike last week
intended to contain raising inflation, dealers said.


Friday's move by the Reserve Bank of India to hike a key short-
term lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 7.75
percent and the amount of cash that banks must hold on deposit
raised concern that credit costs would rise sharply.


The 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex index fell 345.96
points within the first five minutes of trade to 12,726.40.


Banking, construction and housing stocks were the hardest hit as
the rate hike was aimed at slowing down India's booming housing
market and asset price inflation.


Wholesale prices have stayed steady above six percent for the
past month, well above a 5.0-5.5 percent range forecast by the
central bank.


"While the (cash reserve rate) hike was expected, the repo
(lending) rate hike at this juncture makes less sense. It is
quite possible, though speculative, that the RBI is now reacting
to political pressure," said Rajeev Malik, Asia economist with JP
Morgan Chase in Singapore.
