The US Geological Survey on Monday upgraded the magnitude of a
powerful quake that rocked the Solomon Islands and spawned a
tsumani to 8.0 from an earlier reading of 7.6.


The reputed US-based agency revised its initial estimate as
Solomons officials scrambled to establish the extent of damage
and casualties wrought by the quake and the tsunami that battered
the island nation's far west.


The quake struck at 7:39 am (2039 GMT Sunday) about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southeast of the town of Gizo in the New Georgia
Islands.
