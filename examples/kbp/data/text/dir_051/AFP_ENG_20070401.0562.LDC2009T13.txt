Argentina accused Britain Sunday of "arrogance" for its rejection
of international demands for dialogue over the islands that led
to the Falklands War 25 years ago.


As both countries prepared to mark the 25th anniversary of the
outbreak of war on April 2, 1982, Argentine Foreign Minister
Jorge Taiana denounced parades planned by the British.


"What they want to do is not what (Tony Blair) called a
commemoration, but a triumphant military parade, a typical
gesture of arrogance," he said.


Those accusations capped a week of Argentine salvos over the
Falkland Islands, known here by their Spanish name, the Malvinas.


Argentina unilaterally canceled a bilateral oil exploration
agreement with Britain and announced sanctions against companies
exploring in the disputed area.


Nothing unites Argentines like the Falklands war. In 1982,
Argentina was ruled by a right-wing military regime, which
attacked the islands to draw attention away from a slumping
economy and a human rights violations.


It worked: Argentines from across the political spectrum cheered
the military on -- until the military loss proved so humiliating
that the regime collapsed and democracy returned the following
year.
