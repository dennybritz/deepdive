West Indies were 163-7 after 40 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights clash against Sri Lanka here on Sunday chasing 304 to win.


Shivnarine Chanderpaul was on 68 and Ian Bradshaw was on one.


Chris Gayle was first to go caught by Dilhara Fernando off Lasith
Malinga for 10 before Dwayne Bravo was bowled by Chaminda Vaas
for 21.


In the 11th over, the West Indies suffered a major blow when
captain Brian Lara was smartly stumped by wicketkeeper Kumara
Sangakkara off Vaas for two with the score on 42.


With the run rate required creeping up beyond 10 an over, the
West Indies lost Ramnaresh Sarwan to another Sangakkara stumping,
this time off Sanath Jayasuriya for 44 with the score at 134 in
the 35th over.


Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Smith and Denesh Ramdin followed, for
three, nought and two respectively, as the pressure told on the
home side in front of a stunned 12,000 crowd at the Providence
stadium.


Earlier, Jayasuriya top-scored for Sri Lanka with 115, his 25th
century with skipper Mahela Jayawardene making 82.


The West Indies desperately need a win to sustain their hopes of
making it to the semi-finals after losing to defending champions
Australia and New Zealand in their opening two games in the
second round.


Sri Lanka lost their opening second round match to South Africa
by one wicket.
