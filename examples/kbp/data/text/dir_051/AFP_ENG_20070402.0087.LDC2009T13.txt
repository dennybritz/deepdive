A suicide bomber blew up a truck near a primary school and police
station in the northern Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk Monday, killing
six people, including a baby, a doctor said.


Scores of other people were wounded, many of them pupils at the
nearby school, when the explosion ripped through the street in
the north Kirkuk district of Rahimawa, said doctor Abdullah
Mahmud of Kirkuk General Hospital.


Among the six dead were a baby and a policeman, he added.


The suicide bomber blew up the truck outside the local police
criminal investigations department.
