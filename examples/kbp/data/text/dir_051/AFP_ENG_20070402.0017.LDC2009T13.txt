At least six people were killed and the death toll is expected to
rise after a strong earthquake off the Solomon Islands on Monday
which triggered a tsunami, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said.


"Unconfirmed reports have placed the number of dead at about six
and I think we are expecting more," Sogavare told CNN from the
capital Honiara.


"It's a very trying time for us."


Sogavare explained that communications to the affected area in
and around Gizo, a popular tourist and diving destination in the
South Pacific nation, were still patchy, making assessment of
casualties and damage difficult.


"Most of the islands are low-lying and the extent of the damage
is yet to be known," he said, adding that a team from his office,
the Red Cross and police were headed to the zone.


Earlier, chief government spokesman Alfred Maesulia said the
8.0-magnitude quake, and the tsunami which followed, had caused
millions of dollars in damage around Gizo.


"In some coastal villages, waves of up to 10 metres (33 feet)
high swept those villages and destroyed houses and properties,"
Maesulia told CNN.


Earlier police spokesman Mick Spinks said unconfirmed reports
indicated at least four people were dead.
