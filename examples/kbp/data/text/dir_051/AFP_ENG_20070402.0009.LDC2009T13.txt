US investment company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is in
late-stage negotiations to purchase credit-card and payments
processor First Data for more than 24 billion dollars, The Wall
Street Journal reported.


Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said the
talks mark the latest in a string of leveraged buyouts of
established US corporations.


KKR was hoping to make an official announcement over the next few
days, the report said.


The exact purchase price couldn't be learned, though two people
described the price as a premium of at least 20 percent to First
Data's market capitalization of about 20 billion dollars, The
Journal said.
