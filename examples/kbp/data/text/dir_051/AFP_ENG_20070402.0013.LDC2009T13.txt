The Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. Ltd., China's largest steel maker,
saw 2006 net profit rise 2.7 percent to 13 billion yuan (1.7
billion dollars) on steadily rising demand at home, it said
Monday.


The company's sales income jumped 24.6 percent to 157.8 billion
yuan, the company said in a statement.


The steel producer said last year's growth was led by steadily
expanding domestic demand and higher product prices.


However, it anticipated local demand for steel might ease to some
degree this year due to government efforts to curb investment and
pollution. It expects sales this year to reach 159 billion yuan.


The company, also known as Baosteel, plans to invest around 22.7
billion yuan in total in new capacity in 2007.
