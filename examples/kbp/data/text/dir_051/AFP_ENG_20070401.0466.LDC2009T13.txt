Precocious professional Morgan Pressel won the Kraft Nabisco
Championship Sunday, the first major championship on the 2007
women's golf calendar.


Pressel, still just 18 but in her second season on the US women's
tour, captured her first LPGA victory, firing a bogey-free 3
-under-par 69 for a 3-under total of 285.


Norway's Suzann Pettersen, who started the day sharing the lead
with South Korean Se Ri Pak, surrendered the lead in a stetch of
three late holes with a bogey at 15, a double-bogey at 16 and a
bogey at 17 that saw her fall a shot behind Pressel.


Pettersen, unable to birdie 18 to force a playoff, finished with
a 74 for 286, tied for second with Britain's Catriona Matthew
(71) and American Brittany Linicome (72).
