Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels have shot dead eight civilians in
two separate incidents in Sri Lanka's embattled northern and
eastern regions, the defence ministry said Monday.


Gunmen believed to be from the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) killed six construction workers and wounded two more
in the district of Batticaloa late Sunday, the ministry said.


It said two more civilians were shot dead by suspected Tiger
rebels in the northern town of Vavuniya, also on Sunday.


There was no immediate reaction from the LTTE to the defence
ministry's allegations.


The killings came as Sri Lankan jets and helicopter gunships
carried out night- time bombing raids against Tiger rebel
positions.


Fighter aircraft hit a "Sea Tiger" base in the Mullaitivu region
while Mi-24 helicopter gunships attacked a suspected Tiger mortar
bomb position near the de facto border separating the two forces
in Vavuniya, the ministry said.


The Tamil rebels have waged a 35-year campaign for independence
that has claimed more than 60,000 lives in Sri Lanka.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
