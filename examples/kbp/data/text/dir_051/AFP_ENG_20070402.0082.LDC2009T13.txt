At least 12 people were killed and about 20 wounded when a bomb
exploded inside their bus in eastern Sri Lanka Monday, police and
hospital sources said.


The bodies of 12 people, including a child, were brought to the
main hospital in Ampara, 350 kilometres (220 miles) east of
Colombo, a spokesman for the hospital said.


He said about 20 people had been brought in with injuries while
the hospital was ready to accept more victims. Police said they
suspected that the bomb may have exploded inside the civilian
bus.
