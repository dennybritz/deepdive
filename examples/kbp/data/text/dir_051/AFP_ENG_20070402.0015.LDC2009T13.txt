Hong Kong share prices finished the morning session 0.42 percent
higher Monday as fresh fund inflows supported property and
financial stocks in the first session of the second quarter,
dealers said.


The gains were capped as some investors played safe ahead of
upcoming holidays, which will see the market closed from Thursday
until next Monday for the Ching Ming Festival and Easter
holidays.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 82.79 points
at 19,883.72.
