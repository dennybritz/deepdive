A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck in the
Solomon Islands Monday, prompting the Pacific Tsunami Warning
Centre to issue a tsunami warning.


"An earthquake of this size has the potential to generate a
destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near
the epicentre within minutes to hours," the warning centre said.


The centre said it had no confirmed information a tsunami was
generated but said authorities should take appropriate action in
response to the possibility.
