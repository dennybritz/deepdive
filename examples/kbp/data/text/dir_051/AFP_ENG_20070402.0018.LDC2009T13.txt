Rescuers have found the bodies of five of the six workers who
died when a tunnel being built for a subway ahead of the Beijing
Olympics collapsed, state press reported Monday.


The fifth body was discovered on Sunday and the final person
buried underground was likely to be pulled from the rubble on
Monday, the Beijing News reported.


The accident occurred last Wednesday on the No. 10 subway line,
which will connect to a separate line running directly to the
Olympic Village north of Beijing when completed in 2008.


The six workers were buried about 11 metres (33 feet)
underground.


The state-run construction company building the line waited at
least eight hours before notifying authorities of the accident so
it could organise its own rescue teams to keep word from leaking
out, various media reports said.


State media reported Thursday that Beijing police had detained 10
people over the collapse and the attempted cover-up.


State television have blamed the tunnel collapse on "porous
soil", but gave no other details.
