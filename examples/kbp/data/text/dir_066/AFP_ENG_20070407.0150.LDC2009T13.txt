An ally of Philippine President Gloria Arroyo was shot dead on
Saturday in the latest in a series of political killings in the
run-up to elections next month.


Rommel Diasen, who is running for governor of the northern
province of Kalinga, was speaking at an election campaign rally
in the town of Tabuk when he was shot six times, said police
spokesman Superintendent Joseph Adnol.


A man escaped through the crowd afterwards, the spokesman said.


Diasen, 58, who is running for the Lakas (Strength) party, allied
with Arroyo, died in a hospital shortly afterwards.


Police are investigating if the killing is linked to the May 14
polls to elect the entire 250-member House of Representatives,
half the 24-strong Senate and more than 17,000 public officials,
including governors and mayors.


However they are also looking at the possibility that the killing
is related to a tribal feud in the mountainous northern province.


Elections in the Philippines are often marred by vote fraud and
violence.


Rights groups say more than 800 activists, officials, journalists
and missionaries have been assassinated since Arroyo came to
power in 2001.
