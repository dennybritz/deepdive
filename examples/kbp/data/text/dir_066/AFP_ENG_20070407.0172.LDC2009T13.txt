At least 16 people were killed in southern India when a vehicle
carrying explosives blew up, police said.


Police said the jeep was transporting explosives intended for
clearing stones to construct roads.


"The jeep was carrying gelatin sticks. Fourteen people were
killed and 17 were injured," K. Radhakrishnan, inspector general
of police told AFP.


Radhakrishnan said two of the critically injured victims later
died of their injuries in hospital.


The blast occurred at Chendur village some 130 kilometres (80
miles) from Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu state.


Most of the victims were villagers who had gathered near the car
to douse the flames.


Police ruled out earlier reports that the vehicle might have been
transporting explosives to the coast to be smuggled to northern
Sri Lanka, where rebel Tamil Tigers are waging a deadly
insurgency.
