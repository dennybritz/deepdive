US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi
Frazer arrived Saturday on an unannounced visit to Somalia for
talks with the country's president and prime minister.


She is the highest ranking US official to visit war-torn Somalia
since 1994, the US embassy in Nairobi said.


Frazer arrived in the town of Baidoa, seat of the country's
parliament, 250 kilometres (150 miles) northeast of the capital
Mogadishu, local journalists said.


She went into talks with transitional president Abdullahi Yusuf
Ahmed and prime minister Ali Mohamed Guedi as Somali government
troops and US security guards in civilian clothes provided tight
protection.


Frazer, who was also accompanied by US ambassador to Kenya
Michael Ranneberger, arrived as the government and its Ethiopian
allies battled insurgents in the capital Mogadishu.


Washington backed Ethiopia's intervention in Somalia to oust
Islamist militia from the capital three months ago but clashes
have resumed in the past few weeks with Islamic and other
fighters.


Somalia has been torn apart by warlords and other factions since
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991. The transitional
government created in 2004 has failed to impose any control.


A National Reconciliation Conference is planned to start April
16, despite threats of disruption by hardline Islamists alleged
by Washington to have links with Al-Qaeda.
