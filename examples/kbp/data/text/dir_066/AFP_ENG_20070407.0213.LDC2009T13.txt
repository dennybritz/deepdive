Bangladesh were 73-3 after 20 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against South Africa at Providence here on Saturday.


Saqibul Hasan was four not out with Mohammad Ashraful also
unbeaten on four.


After a solid start, which saw the Bangladesh openers put on 42,
Javed Omar was the first man out caught by South Africa skipper
Graeme Smith off recalled seamer Andre Nel for 17.


Skipper Habibul Bashar made just five before he was caught and
bowled by Nel with the score on 59 in the 18th over before
teenager opener Tamim Iqbal was caught by wicket-keeper Mark
Boucher for 38 in the 20th over with the total on 69.


South Africa have already earned four points after beating Sri
Lanka and Ireland in the second round, while Bangladesh have yet
to open their account.


South Africa replaced all-rounder Andrew Hall with paceman Nel
for the only change from the team that beat debutants Ireland in
the last match here.


Bangladesh retained the side that lost to New Zealand in the last
game.
