America's Cup defending champions Alinghi won a regatta here on
Saturday and finished top of the Act 13 overall standings but it
was Emirates Team New Zealand which retained four bonus points
for the forthcoming Louis-Vuitton Cup.


The Swiss Alinghi team was the undisputed champion of Act 13 with
four regattas won out of seven and only once finishing off the
podium when fourth in the first regatta.


"It's a good thing for us that we can have races against the
other teams," said Alinghi's New Zealand skipper Brad Butterworth
the day before the act started. "We will get something out of it
but it is not the same as match racing."


Act 13 is the final preliminary leg in which Alinghi's 11
challengers gain bonus points ahead of the Louis Vuitton Cup
(April 16-May 7).


The Louis-Vuitton winner earns the right to take on Alinghi,
which defends the title they won in Auckland Bay in New Zealand
four years ago, in the 32nd America's Cup best-of-nine race match
in June.
