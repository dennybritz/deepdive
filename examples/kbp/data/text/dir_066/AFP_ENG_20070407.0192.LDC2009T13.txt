A 48-hour strike by ground staff at Budapest airport ended
Saturday, airport spokesman Domokos Szollar said.


Szollar said 33 out of a total 624 flights had to be cancelled
during the strike, which began at 1230 GMT on Thursday and ended
at 1230 GMT on Saturday.


Dozens of other flights were delayed.


Airport officials initially predicted that up to 160 flights
would have to be cancelled because of the strike, which was
triggered by the breakdown of  salary negotiations between
workers and management.
