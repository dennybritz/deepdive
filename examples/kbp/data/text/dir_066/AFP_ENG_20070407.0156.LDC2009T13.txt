Pro Tour teams have asked cycling authorities to carry out DNA
tests on all riders implicated in the Spanish Operation Puerto
scandal.


The demand comes in the wake of DNA evidence that linked former
Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich with blood sachets found in the
laboratory of tainted doctor Eufemiano Fuentes, as part of the
Puerto investigation.


In a joint statement, the Pro Tour teams and the International
Association of Professional Cycling Groups (AIGCP) have asked all
cycling authorities to use the DNA of cyclists implicated in the
affair to discover whether or not their blood was found in the
laboratory.


"We're not going to let this go," AIGCP spokesman Roger Legeay
told AFP. "After the Ullrich case it has been shown that we can
identify the blood found in the Puerto affair.


"There is no other solution. Every rider implicated in the affair
must submit (to a DNA test) otherwise suspicion will will descend
on them from their first result."
