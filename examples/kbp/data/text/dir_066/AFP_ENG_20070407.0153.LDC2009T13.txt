Sweden's Thomas Johansson and Argentina's Guillermo Canas were
drafted in as both teams changed their scheduled pairing for
Saturday's doubles in their Davis Cup quarter-final.


Jonas Bjorkman and Johansson were playing David Nalbandian and
Canas in a match which started at 1200GMT on Saturday. Sweden's
Robert Lindstedt, who was due to play with Bjorkman, and
Sebastian Prieto, set to team up with Nalbandian, were left on
the sidelines.


Sweden lead Argentina 2-0 after winning both Friday's opening
singles. Johansson beat Nalbandian 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7/2), 6-2, 7-6
(7/0) and Robin Soderling got the better of Juan Martin del Potro
7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.
