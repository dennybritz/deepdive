A Sudanese army truck loaded with munitions exploded on Saturday
in the capital Khartoum where the nearby airport was closed "as a
precaution", an airport official said.


An army spokesman said the blast had not caused any casualties.


"A series of explosions occurred on a truck loaded with
munitions, which burned the vehicle," said Brigadier General
Othman Mohammed Al-Aghbach, adding there had been no "human
loss".


The airport official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
AFP: "The airport has been closed until further orders as a
precautionary measure, given that it is not far from the
munitions depot near where the explosion happened."


Aghbach said the munitions went off because of the "shaking" of
the truck which was being driven in an area close to the army
headquarters in central Khartoum.


The area has been evacuated, Aghbach told the official SUNA news
agency.


Witnesses said the explosion caused a fireball, and columns of
smoke could be seen rising into the air.


Roads leading to the area of the blast were sealed off to traffic
and onlookers were barred from approaching.
