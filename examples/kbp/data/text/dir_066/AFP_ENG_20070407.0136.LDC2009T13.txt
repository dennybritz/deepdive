Dozens of Taliban militants attacked Saturday a US-funded mine-
clearing team in southern Afghanistan, killing three deminers,
three guards and a female civilian, police said.


The attack on the demining team working for the US-based demining
company RONCO in western Farah province was the latest in a wave
of violence blamed on the Taliban insurgents, police said.


"The Taliban attacked a demining team. Three deminers and three
guards supporting them were killed," a highway police official,
Saydo Jan, told AFP.


"One Afghan woman nearby was also killed in the shootout," he
said.


Five people including three women who were passing by when the
fighting erupted were wounded in the attack in the province's
Bakwa district, the police official said.


He blamed the attack on Taliban militants active in the area.


Afghanistan is the second most mined country in the world, the
result of years of war and insurgency.


The crew were travelling to the western city of Herat from
Taliban-dominated Kandahar when they came under attack.


Taliban militants are waging a bloody insurgency in Afghanistan
after being ousted from power five years ago.


As part of their campaign they have been attacking Afghan and
foreign troops as well as aid workers and journalists.


The rebels kidnapped two French aid workers along with their
three Afghan assistants in neighboring Nimroz on Tuesday.
