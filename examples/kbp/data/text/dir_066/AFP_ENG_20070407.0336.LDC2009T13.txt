A heavily armed group made a daring attempt to free a suspected
Italian drug trafficker from a Rio jail before police discovered
the brazen escape bid, authorities said Saturday.


Ten men arrived in three vehicles at the back of the Heitor
Carrilho jail hospital, where Alessandro Castiglione was
undergoing a medical exam, the Penitentiary Administration
Secretariat told local media.


They tossed a rope over a wall to free the Italian prisoner and
two others, but a special police unit discovered the attempt by
chance and exchanged fire with the assailants, authorities said.


The group had hoped to take advantage of a change of guards to
free the prisoners, authorities said.


"The escape was very well planned," Isabela Rodrigues, a police
official, told Globo daily newspaper.


Castiglione, who was arrested in 2003, was transferred to a high-
security prison on Friday. Police told local media that the
Italian is linked to international drug trafficking in Brazil and
Europe.


The website Globo G1 reported that police link him to a drug
smuggling ring that was sending one tonne of Colombian cocaine to
Europe and the United States.
