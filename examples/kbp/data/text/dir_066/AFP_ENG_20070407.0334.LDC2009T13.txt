Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko vowed on Saturday to press
ahead with an order to dissolve parliament that has plunged this
former Soviet republic into a political crisis.


"My decision is legitimate and constitutional and there will be
no going back," Yushchenko said during a televised speech in the
Ukrainian capital Kiev to mark the Easter holiday.
