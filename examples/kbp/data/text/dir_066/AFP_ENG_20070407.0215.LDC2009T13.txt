Doubles duo Thomas Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman booked Sweden's
spot in the Davis Cup semi-finals with a day to spare on Saturday
as the hosts took an unbeatable 3-0 lead over last year's
runners-up Argentina.


Bjorkman and Johansson defeated David Nalbandian and Guillermo
Canas 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2, 6-3 in just under three hours to put
Sweden into the last four for the first time since 2001.


Sweden won both Friday's opening singles on the indoors carpet
surface when Johansson beat Nalbandian 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7/2), 6-2,
7-6 (7/0) and Robin Soderling got the better of Juan Martin del
Potro 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.


The Swedes will now meet the winner of the tie between the United
States and Spain which is being played at Winston-Salem, North
Carolina.


The South Americans enjoyed a 5-0 whitewash against the Swedes in
Buenos Aires in the opening round of last year's competition.
