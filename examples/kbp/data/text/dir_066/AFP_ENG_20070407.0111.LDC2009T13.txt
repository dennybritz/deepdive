French forward David Trezeguet told the Italian press on Saturday
that he intends to remain at disgraced Italian second division
leaders Juventus.


Trezeguet was one of several Juve players that tried to force a
move away from the Stadio delle Alpi in the close season after
the Turin giants were relegated to the second division and docked
points for their part in a match-fixing scandal.


Trezeguet was not granted his wish of a move away but his
attitude has now changed.


And despite facing a second successive season out of European
competition, the French forward has decided to stay at the club.


"I'm very attached to this jersey that I've been wearing for
seven years. I want to stay here longer, even if there will be no
Champions League (next season)," he said.


"I know it but I'm ready to make this sacrifice. And without the
European Cup, maybe we'll be able to win the title next season."


Juve are currently top of the second division table with a four
point lead on Genoa after 30 matches.


They were stripped of their last two league titles following the
match-ixing scandal.
