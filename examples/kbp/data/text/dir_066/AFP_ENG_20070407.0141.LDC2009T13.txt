About 150 students rallied here Saturday to remember a Senegalese
student murdered last year in a spate of racist attacks on
Africans and other foreigners.


Russian students from the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, or
"Ours," lay flowers and lit candles at the site in the city
center where 28-year-old Samba Lampsar Sall was shot in the head
in April 2006 as he left a nightclub with other Africans.


"A year has gone by already and we still don't know who killed
our friend," said Adam Obatuki, a 28-year-old medical student
from Benin who was one of a small number of African students at
the memorial.


Sall's killing was one of the rare cases in which Russian
authorities classified an attack on a foreigner as racially
motivated. The murder weapon, a gun imprinted with a swastika,
was found near the scene.


Prosecutors said this week that about 10 people would soon stand
trial in connection with the murder.


Last year 539 people were victims of racist attacks, a 17 percent
rise on 2005, and 56 of them died, the Sova analytical center
said in a report in March.
