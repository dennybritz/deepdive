Three mountain climbers were killed when they fell some 800
metres (2,500 feet) in the French Alps, rescue services said
Saturday.


The three experienced climbers, all French and aged between 21
and 23, were roped together on a technically difficult route up
the face of the 4,015 metre Dome des Ecrins when they fell.


Their bodies were found Friday after a helicopter search was
launched.
