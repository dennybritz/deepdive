Two Basque separatists were sentenced to 290 years in prison for
an attack in 2000 on a civil guard barracks that injured 16
people, Spanish media reported Saturday.


Spain's highest criminal court sentenced Luis Maria Carrasco
Aseguinolaza and Ibon Echezarreta Echaniz for terrorist
assassination attempts on nine civil guard members and seven
police officers.


Despite the sentence, prison time is limited to 40 years in
Spain.


The two suspects, members of Basque separatist group ETA, were
found guilty of the grenade attack on the barracks in November
2000 in San Sebastian.


They allegedly left behind a booby-trapped grenade launcher that
exploded when workers attempted to remove it, causing four
serious injuries.


The barracks is the headquarters for Spain's civil guard in the
Basque region.


The court judged the attack to be particularly aggressive and
opted for more serious charges of attempted assassination instead
of attempted murder, according to Europa Press.


ETA's 38-year-old campaign for Basque independence has claimed
more than 800 lives.
