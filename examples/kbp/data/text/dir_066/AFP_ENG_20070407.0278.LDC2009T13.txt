The United States is to take China before the World Trade
Organization this week in a copyright piracy row, the latest of
several US trade moves against the Asian giant, a report said
Saturday.


The administration of President George W. Bush is to refer two
charges of alleged abuse of intellectual property by China to the
global mediator "this coming week," The Wall Street Journal
financial daily reported.


The US accuses China of being too soft in enforcing its own
antipiracy laws while at the same time restricting too tightly
quotas for the distribution of foreign music, films and books --
which hits the US industries hard.


Media piracy in China is believed to cost the US movie powerhouse
billions of dollars a year in lost income, according to industry
figures cited by the newspaper.


This week's move would be the latest in a series of actions by
the US against China trade activities. In February the Bush
administration filed a case with the WTO accusing Beijing of
unfairly subsidizing Chinese industries.


The newspaper said these proceedings have worried some US
companies, which fear they will jeopardize progress already made
in persuading Chinese officials to cooperate in fighting piracy.
