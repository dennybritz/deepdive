Two foreigners were kidnapped on Friday night in volatile oil-
rich southern Nigeria, police and industry sources said Saturday.


"They were driving last night in Port Harcourt while they were
intercepted", Rivers State police chief Felix Ogbaudu told AFP.


A industry source said the men were both Turkish nationals and
that they work for Italian oil company Agip.
