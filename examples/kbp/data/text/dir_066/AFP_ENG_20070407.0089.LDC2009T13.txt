Asian Games silver medallists Japan got off to a winning start to
the final qualifying round for the Beijing Olympics with a 2-0
win over Vietnam in a Group A match on Saturday.


The opening goal came from Japan's top goal scorer Homare Sawa,
who struck home a headed pass from Eriko Arakawa, following a
cross from Kozuke Ando in the 36th minute.


In the 73rd minute, Sawa cut back a free kick by substitute
defender Yukari Kinga to set up Tomoe Sakai for the second goal.


Japan controlled the game, encamping in Vietnamese territory for
most of the match, but they failed to create a clear scoring
chance for most of a frustrating first half as the visitors kept
their attacks at bay.


Japan had two chances at the end of the half, one from a free
kick by Kinga and another from a cross from the left by Aya
Miyama, but neither were converted.


Japan threatened the Vietnamese goal more in the second half. One
shot from Sawa, from a pass by Shinobu Ono, landed in the net in
the 54th minute, but it was ruled offside.


Five minutes later, Miyama's shot narrowly went wide, while one
Kinga right- footer went over the bar in the 77th minute. The
visitors did not conjure one serious chance in the game.


It was Japan's sixth straight win against Vietnam in six
encounters.


Japan will play an away game against Thailand, while Vietnam will
challenge South Korea at home, in their next games on April 15.
The top finishers will qualify for the Olympics next year.
