Yutaka Niida defended his World Boxing Association minimum weight
title on Saturday by beating fellow Japanese Katsunari Takayama
with a split decision victory.


It was Niida's fifth defence of the title he wrested from Noel
Arambulet of Venezuela in July 2004.


He stretched his record to 21 wins, including eight knock outs,
against one defeat and three draws.


Niida became the champion in August 2001, but abandoned the title
before coming back to the ring in July 2003.


Saturday's bout was originally set for September last year, but
Niida fractured a rib during training a week earlier and
postponed the match.


Niida's injury meant he was unable to defend his title twice in
one year, a requirement under WBA rules, allowing Takayama to
fight to claim the title.


Takayama, former World Boxing Council champion of the same class,
became the "interim" champion by defeating Carlos Melo of Panama
with a technical knockout in the ninth round.


However Saturday's fight saw Niida reclaim the title, and
Takayama's record reduced to 18 wins, including seven KOs,
against three defeats.
