At least 14 people were killed and 17 injured in southern India
when a vehicle carrying explosives blew up, police said.


"The jeep was carrying gelatine sticks. Fourteen people were
killed and 17 were injured. Two of them are in a critical
condition," K. Radhakrishnan, inspector general of police told
AFP.


The blast occurred at Chendur village some 130 kilometers (80
miles) from Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu state.


Most of the victims were villagers who had gathered near the car
to douse the flames.


Police said the jeep was transporting explosives -- meant for
clearing stones to construct roads -- from a licensed shop.


They ruled out earlier reports that the vehicle might have been
transporting weapons to the coast to be smuggled to northern Sri
Lanka, where rebel Tamil Tigers are waging a deadly insurgency.
