A senior US official Saturday called on Cambodian and foreign
judges to resolve a dispute over legal fees and to push ahead
with the long-delayed Khmer Rouge genocide tribunal.


"If the international judges are able to work with their
Cambodian counterparts on a compromise, absolutely we support
that," said Eric John, the deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asia and Pacific affairs.


"The Khmer Rouge tribunal is really the opportunity for Cambodia
to show the international community how far it's advanced," he
said at a press conference after a four-day visit here.


The Cambodian Bar Association has demanded foreign defence
lawyers pay 4,900 dollars in fees -- an amount that critics say
would discourage many from seeking clients and deprive defendants
of their right to counsel.


International jurists said earlier in the week that they would
not hold a plenary of judges set for April 30 because the dispute
remains unresolved.


Their Khmer counterparts have urged them to reconsider, saying
the fee issue is outside the court's mandate.


"I think what they need to do is look at the much larger picture
and how Cambodia looks on the international stage," John said.


Up to two million people died of overwork, starvation and
execution under the Khmer Rouge, which abolished religion,
property rights, currency and schools.


Millions more were driven from the cities onto vast collective
farms as the ultra-Maoist regime sought to create an agrarian
utopia.
