A Sudanese army truck loaded with munitions exploded in the
capital city, Khartoum, on Saturday with no reports of
casualties, an army spokesman said.


"A series of explosions occurred on a truck loaded with
munitions, which burned the vehicle," said Othman Mohammed Al-
Aghbach, adding there had been no "human loss".


He said the incident was caused by the "shaking" of the truck
which was being driven in an area close to the army headquarters
in central Khartoum.


The area has been evacuated, Aghbach told the official SUNA news
agency.


Witnesses said the explosion caused a fireball, and columns of
smoke could be seen rising into the air.


Roads leading to the area of the blast were sealed off to traffic
and onlookers were barred from approaching.
