Beijing on Saturday slammed as "defamatory" an official US report
into the communist country's human rights record, adding that the
United States was in no position to lecture other countries.


The State Department report "ignores basic facts, slanders and
attacks China's human rights situation," a spokesman for the
foreign ministry said.


China "repudiated" the report, spokesman Qin Gang said in a
statement on the ministry's website.


"The United States is not in a position to depict itself as a
human rights watchdog," it said of the April 5 report.


"The United States should seriously reflect on its own human
rights problems and put an end to its double or multiple
standards on human rights," it added.


Titled Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The US record 2006,
the report, submitted to Congress, took stock of the efforts made
by the US to encourage respect for human rights across the world.


The section on China said: "The Chinese Government continued to
deny citizens basic democratic rights, and law enforcement
authorities suppressed those perceived to threaten the legitimacy
or authority of the Chinese Communist Party."


"Chinese officials continued to enforce measures in an attempt to
curb the growth of China's emerging civil society," it added.


It also highlighted cases involving the "monitoring, harassment,
detention, arrest, and imprisonment" of journalists, writers,
activists, and lawyers, "seeking to exercise their rights under
law."
