Security forces in Yemen on Saturday arrested a man suspected of
involvement in an attack on a mosque during which worshippers
were sprayed with petrol and set on fire.


Amran district governor Taha Abdallah Hajer, quoted by the
official Saba news agency, said the suspect was being
interrogated to try to find out why the attack took place. He
named the detained man as Hamid al-Shumi.


Thirty people were wounded, eight of them seriously, when
unidentified men struck during Muslim Friday prayers at the
mosque in Amran some 60 kilometres (40 miles) north of the
capital Sanaa.
