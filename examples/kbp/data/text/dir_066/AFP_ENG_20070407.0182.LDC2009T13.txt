A senior official in Germany's powerful IG Metall trade union
warned of strike action in the metal industry if bosses do not
make an "acceptable" pay offer in the next two weeks, in an
interview published Saturday.


"IG Metall will not hesitate to stage a confrontation," union
vice president Bethold Huber told the Stuttgarter Zeitung daily.
"The employers should not underestimate the current atmosphere."


"Given the favourable and generally recognised economic
situation, we want our employees to be given further increases,"
he said, adding that the current three percent offer was way
below what was possible.


Suedwestmetall, the employers federation in the key state of
Baden-Wurtemberg, has offered an increase in wages of 2.5
percent, plus a bonus for one year of 0.5 percent.


Huber said the metal industry was well able to match the 3.6
percent increase coupled with a 0.7 percent bonus for 13 months
obtained in March from the chemical industry.
