Three men accused of conspiring with the four suicide bombers who
attacked London in 2005, killing themselves and 52 others, were
remanded in custody Saturday when they appeared in court, media
said.


Mohammed Shakil, 30, Sadeer Saleem, 26, and Waheed Ali, 23, are
the first people to be charged in connection with the near-
simultaneous rush-hour attacks on July 7, 2005 that also injured
more than 700.


The trio, all from the Beeston area of Leeds, northern England,
were remanded in custody at City of Westminster Magistrates Court
in central London until a further hearing on April 20, the BBC
and Sky News television reported.
