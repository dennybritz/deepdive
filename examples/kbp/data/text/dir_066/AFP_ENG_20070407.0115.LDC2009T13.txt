The US military said Saturday that two more of its soldiers had
been killed in attacks in Baghdad, taking to 17 the number of
troops who have died in Iraq this month.


One soldier was killed and four others wounded when an
explosively-formed projectile exploded in an eastern section of
the capital during a combat patrol on Friday, the military said.


US commanders charge that such devices are supplied to Iraq's
Shiite militias by elements of the Iranian regime.


The second soldier died, and three more were wounded, in a
traditional roadside bombing during a patrol in west Baghdad on
Friday, the military said.


The deaths brought to 3,265 the US military's losses in Iraq
since the 2003 invasion, according to an AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.
