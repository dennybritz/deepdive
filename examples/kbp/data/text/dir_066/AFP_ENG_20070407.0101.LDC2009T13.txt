The Iraqi government has agreed to a new meeting between its
neighbours and world powers in Egypt next month, Foreign Minister
Hoshyar Zebari said Saturday


"The Iraqi government agreed to hold the next ministerial meeting
of Iraq neighbouring countries, plus the G5 (UN Security Council
veto-wielding permanent members) and G8 (most industrialised
nations) in Egypt, most probably in Sharm el-Sheikh on May 3 and
4," Zebari told a Baghdad news conference.


An ambassador-level conference in Baghdad held on March 10 to
discuss the security situation in Iraq saw the United States and
regional foes Iran and Syria hold rare direct talks.


That meeting was due to be followed up by the ministerial-level
conference, which could see US Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice meet her Iranian counterpart.


However Zebari did not specify the guest list for the new
meeting.


"This is a very important meeting and a major development in the
politics of the Middle East and the world maybe, because ... of
the participants and the agreement to discuss one subject, that
it is Iraq," he added.
