A Sudanese army truck loaded with weapons exploded in the capital
city of Khartoum on Saturday, witnesses said.


There were no immediate reports of casualties from the blast or
details on what caused it.


The explosion caused a fireball, and columns of smoke could be
seen rising into the air.


Roads leading to the location of the blast, near the army
headquarters, were sealed off to traffic and onlookers were
barred from approaching the scene.
