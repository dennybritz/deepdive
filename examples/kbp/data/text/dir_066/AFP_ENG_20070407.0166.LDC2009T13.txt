Sudan on Saturday said it was ready to probe accusations that its
soldiers raped women and committed war crimes during attacks late
last year in the country's war-torn region of Darfur.


Justice Minister Ali al Mardhi, however, termed the charges as
presumptions, a day after the UN humanitarian chief Louise Arbour
called on Khartoum to launch investigations into the incidents.


"This is a presumption, even with regard to this presumption we
are aready to investigate whatever complaints are made in this
regard," al Mardhi told a press conference in Nairobi.


He said the governent had set up an administration "to combat
violence against women" and that it had "sufficient prosecutors
and policewomen and staff."


On Friday, Arbour urged Sudan to investigate the cases, which
include charges of at least 15 rapes carried out during attacks
in December on villages which supported the Darfur rebels.


Some of the victims were as young as 13 years old and two women
were pregnant. Some were raped on the spot while others were
taken away, raped and then released, according to one report by
Arbour's monitors in Sudan.


In addition, Arbour called on Minni Arkoy Minnawi, the head of
the former rebel Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) which signed a peace
deal with Khartoum last year, to disclose the fate of 19 men who
disappeared and were reportedly tortured or killed after they
were arrested by his forces last September.
