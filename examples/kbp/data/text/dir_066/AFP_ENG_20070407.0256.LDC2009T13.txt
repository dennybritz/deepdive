The United States Saturday denied involvement in the detention of
an Iranian diplomat who said he was tortured by his captors, whom
he said included US intelligence agents.


"The United States had nothing to do with Mr Sharafi's detention,
and we welcome his return to Iran," White House national security
spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters in this Texas town where
President George W. Bush is spending Easter at his country ranch.


Jalal Sharafi, second secretary at Iran's Baghdad embassy, was
quoted by the Iranian state news agency IRNA as saying he was
"subjected to different forms of torture day and night" after his
abduction in the Iraqi capital in February.


He said he was seized by Iraqi defense officials who rode in US
military vehicles, and questioned by Arabic-speaking and English-
speaking interrogators, including ones who he claimed were US
intelligence agents.


He said his captors tortured him and questioned him on "Iran's
presence and influence in Iraq." He was freed on April 3.


Sharafi's seizure came amid increasing tension between Iran and
the United States after US forces arrested five Iranians on
January 11 in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil on suspicion of
aiding the Iraqi insurgency.
