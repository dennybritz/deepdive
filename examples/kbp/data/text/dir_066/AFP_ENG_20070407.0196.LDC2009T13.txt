Germany moved into the Davis Cup semi-finals on Saturday after
their doubles victory by Alexander Waske and Michael Kohlmann
gave them a 3-0 winning lead against Belgium.


Waske and Kohlmann beat Olivier and Christophe Rochus 4-6, 6-2,
6-3, 6-1 to add to their two singles victories on Friday in the
Sleuyter Arena.


Tommy Haas had beaten Kristof Vliegen 6-7 (4/7), 7-5, 6-4, 6-2
and Philipp Kohlschreiber got the better of Olivier Rochus 6-3,
7-5, 7-6 (7/4).


Germany will now play a September 21-23 semi-final against France
or Russia in an away tie.


Waske and Kohlmann's more serves and imposing net play proved
decisive despite a slow start in which they dropped the first
set.


However the Belgians' poor showing in the service department --
they only managed one ace and had four double faults -- plus
vulnerability on the big points, helped Germany complete the
victory.


Doubles specialists Waske and Kohlmann eventually won the match
in 2 hours 25 minutes without giving the impression they had had
to work for the win.
