A Soyuz rocket bearing US-Hungarian space tourist Charles Simonyi
and two Russian cosmonauts blasted off at 11:31 p.m. local time
(1731 GMT) Saturday from the Russian space centre here.


The rocket took off on schedule, carrying a TMA-10 space capsule
with Simonyi, Oleg Kotov and Fyodor Yurchikhin toward the
International Space Station (ISS).


Simonyi, 58, is a former pioneer at US software giant Microsoft
who paid about 25 million dollars (19 billion euros) to fly to
the ISS, where he will be until April 20.
