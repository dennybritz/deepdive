Rwandan President Paul Kagame made another swingeing attack on
France Saturday at a ceremony marking the 13th anniversary of the
Rwandan genocide, accusing French forces of killing Rwandans.


"The French did not come to save the Rwandans, they came to kill
them," Kagame said in the broadcast speech from the southern town
of Murambi, referring to a French military intervention codenamed
Operation Turquoise.


French troops went in to Rwanda in 1994 during the massacres of
ethnic minority Tutsis by Hutu extremists which killed some
800,000 people. Paris claimed they saved many lives.


However Kagame's former rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which
seized power in the wake of the genocide, accused France of
permitting many Hutu militants to escape justice.


Before Kagame spoke, survivors accused French troops of killing
and raping Tutsis, as well as laying a volley-ball court on top
of a mass grave at Murambi.


"Playing volley-ball over the grave of people they had just
killed or caused to be killed proved that they considered the
Rwandans worthless," Kagame charged.


"The international community failed, it played a role in the
genocide," he said, referring to the inability of foreign
peacekeepers to stop the massacres sparked by the shooting down
of then Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana's plane.


Some countries have apologised for the lapses, but not France.


In November last year, Kigali broke ties with Paris after French
judge Jean- Louis Bruguiere called for Kagame to be tried for
alleged complicity in the death of Habyarimana. Kagame denied the
allegations.
