The Greek coastguard on Saturday intercepted 34 would-be
immigrants on the Aegean island of Chios, the merchant marine
ministry said.


The illegal migrants neared the island on an eight-metre
(26-foot) wooden boat and landed despite warnings from a Greek
coastguard patrol to turn back.


The boat later caught fire and sank.


The migrants, who are without identification papers, were taken
to the local hospital for health tests.


Greece lies on a major people-smuggling transit route from Asia
to Western Europe, detaining scores of illegal migrants each
month both by land and sea.
