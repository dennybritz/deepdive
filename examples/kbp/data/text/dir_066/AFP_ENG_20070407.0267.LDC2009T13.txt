Cambridge stormed to victory in the 153rd boat race, coming from
behind to beat Oxford in the annual event on the River Thames
between the historic British universities.


This year's favourites won by a length and a quarter to deny the
Dark Blues a hat-trick of victories.


The two boats were side by side for the first mile and came close
to touching oars before Oxford gained a slight advantage.


But the Light Blues edged in front and despite a determined
effort from Oxford, they could not catch their old rivals.


Cambridge lead the overall series, which dates back to 1829, by
79-73, with one dead heat. The race is contested heading upstream
over a 4.25-mile (6.85-kilometre) stretch of the Thames through
London.


Cambridge's bid to regain the title they last won in 2004 rested
on their crew's experience. The Light Blues' squad included
British Olympians Kieran West and Tom James, plus German world
champions Thorsten Engelmann and Sebastian Schulte.
