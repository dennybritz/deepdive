Two Turkish engineers were kidnapped on Friday night in volatile
oil-rich southern Nigeria, police and industry sources said
Saturday.


Rivers State police chief Felix Ogbaudu told AFP the men worked
for Marta Engineering, a subcontractor for Italian oil company
Agip.


"They were driving last night in Port Harcourt when they were
intercepted", Ogbaudu said.


A industry source said the men set off to attend a meeting at
Port Harcourt's Presidential Hotel but never arrived and have not
been heard from since.


No one has claimed responsibilty for this latest kidnapping.


Marta Engineering was not immediately available for comment. Agip
never comments on kidnappings involving its staff or its
subcontractors.


Since the start of this year, more than 60 foreigners have been
kidnapped in southern Nigeria, at least as many as were abducted
during the whole of 2006.


Two Chinese nationals abducted on March 17 in the southeastern
state of Anambra remain missing.


But four foreign hostages -- two Lebanese men, a Briton and a
Dutch national -- were released three days ago after being held
in separate locations in the Niger delta by different armed
groups.
