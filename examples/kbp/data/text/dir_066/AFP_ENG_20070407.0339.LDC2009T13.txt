The 15 British sailors and marines who spent two weeks in Iranian
captivity have been granted permission to sell their stories to
the media, it was announced Saturday.


In what is a highly unusual step, the Ministry of Defence said
its ban on serving personnel entering into financial agreements
with media organisations was being relaxed because of
"exceptional" circumstances.


A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said that "in exceptional
circumstances such as the awarding of a Victoria Cross (the
forces' top valour award) or events such as those in recent days,
permission can be granted by commanding officers and the Ministry
of Defence.


"That's what has happened here."


She said there had been "considerable media interest" in buying
the groups' stories but could not confirm whether any deals had
yet been struck.


The group was dramatically freed by Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad Wednesday and flew back to Britain Thursday.
