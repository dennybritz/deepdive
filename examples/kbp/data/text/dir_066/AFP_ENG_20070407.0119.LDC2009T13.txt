Brazilian defender Pepe is out for the rest of the season with a
knee injury, his Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira said Saturday.


Pepe was injured towards the end of a championship match Friday
against Vitoria Setubal, which the reigning champions won 5-1.


"This injury will probably keep him off the field until the end
of the season," said Ferreira.


"I realised straight away that it was serious. A twisted knee can
have many consequences."


The 23-year-old, who joined Porto from Corinthians in 2001, has
been an important part of the league leaders' squad this season
and is also close to securing duel Portuguese-Brazilian
nationality.
