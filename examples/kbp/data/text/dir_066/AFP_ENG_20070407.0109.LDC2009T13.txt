The head of Russia's Orthodox Church, Alexy II, put aside long-
running differences with the Roman Catholic Church to send Easter
greetings to Pope Benedict XVI, in a letter quoted by the
Interfax news agency Saturday.


"I ... wish you blessed peace, good health and the Risen
Saviour's help in your lofty service" on the "ever-joyful holiday
of Easter," the patriarch said.


Alexy also congratulated Armenia's Catholicos Garegin II and
Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who also celebrate
Easter this Sunday.


The patriarch had been locked in a bitter row with the Vatican
over alleged Roman Catholic proselytism in Russia and so-called
Vatican "expansionism" in this predominantly Orthodox country.


Catholics, numbering around 500,000 in Russia, represent a tiny
minority of Russia's 145 million-strong population, most of whom
will celebrate Orthodox Easter on Sunday.
