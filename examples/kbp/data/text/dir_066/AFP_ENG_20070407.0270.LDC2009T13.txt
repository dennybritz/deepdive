Former US Open finalist Greg Rusedski on Saturday announced his
retirement from tennis after helping Great Britain to a Davis Cup
victory over the Netherlands.


Rusedski, 33, revealed his decision in an emotional courtside
interview following his doubles' victory with Jamie Murray that
gave Britain an unassailable 3-0 lead in their Euro-Africa Zone
Group One tie in Birmingham.


The former world number four, who lost to Patrick Rafter in the
US Open final in 1997, fought back tears as he said he had kept
his retirement from tennis secret to avoid distracting his Davis
Cup team-mates.


Rusedski, who had played just one previous match this year after
struggling with a hip injury, said: "It was a proud moment as
it's going to be my last match. I'm officially retiring on a win
today.


"I wanted to play one more tie at home. It's been a tough last
year and now, with a family, your life changes. I felt like I
couldn't do it any more.


"I made the decision at the start of the year but I didn't want
to take away from the tie and have team-mates answering questions
about my retirement so I only told the others after the final
point."


After turning professional in 1991, the Montreal-born Rusedski
took British citizenship in 1995.


He tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone in 2003
but he was cleared of any doping offence the following March.
