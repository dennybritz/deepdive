US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi
Frazer arrived Saturday on an unannounced visit to Somalia for
talks with the country's president and prime minister.


It was the first visit in several years by a top US official to
the country, which has been in the grips of civil war since 1991.


Frazer arrived in the town of Baidoa, seat of the country's
parliament, 250 kilometres (150 miles) northeast of the capital
Mogadishu, local journalists said.
