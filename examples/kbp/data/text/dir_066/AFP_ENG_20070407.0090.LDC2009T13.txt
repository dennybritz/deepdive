Felipe Massa has all the qualities required to become this year's
Formula One drivers' world champion, his former team chief Peter
Sauber has said.


Sauber, who gave Massa his debut in Formula One in his own team
in 2002, said that the young Brazilian had matured enough to
understand how to win - and, crucially, had learned invaluable
lessons as now retired Michael Schumacher's team-mate at Ferrari
last year.


Sauber said: "He has all the requirements to be the champion. I
think the most important thing is the car. Obviously, he also has
the bad luck of having one of the fastest drivers - if not the
fastest of all - as his team-mate!"


Sauber's joke at the speed of Finn Kimi Raikkonen was heartfelt
because he was also given his debut by the Sauber team.


Sauber added: "I think the atmosphere in Ferrari is very good for
Felipe. The year he was test driver at Maranello was important
for his development. Massa has matured well.


"He's always had the speed and he worked on it by becoming
consistent and by making fewer errors."


Massa won two races in 2006 with Ferrari and started this season
as one of the favourites to be fighting for the drivers' title -
even being tipped by ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone as the man to
watch.


"I am maybe a little bit surprised by his progress, but in a
positive way, considering how much Massa got close to (Michael)
Schumacher last year. And also for his consistency," he said.
