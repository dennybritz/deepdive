An alliance of Sunni groups headed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq said on
Saturday it had shot down a US helicopter two days earlier south
of Baghdad, "killing all its occupants."


The US military acknowledged on Thursday that a helicopter
carrying nine people had crashed south of Iraq's capital but said
just four people were injured. It gave no details of the type of
craft or the cause of the crash.


"Soldiers of the Islamic State in Iraq have been able to shoot
down an American helicopter, a Black Hawk, in the south of
Baghdad province, with the help of sophisticated anti-aircraft
weapons. All its occupants were killed," the Islamic State said
on its internet site.


In another statement, the alliance claimed responsibility for a
suicide attack on Friday which, according to the police, killed
at least 27 people and wounded 30 in Ramadi, west of Baghdad.


"A hero of the 'martyrs' brigade' of the Islamic State in Iraq
launched himself with his booby-trapped vehicle into a gathering
of apostates in a region in Ramadi, west of Baghdad, killing at
least 25 apostates and seriously wounding 40 others," the
statement said.


On Friday, a police officer said: "At least 27 people, many of
them women and children, have been killed in the attack."


He said another 30 were wounded and that the bomber was targeting
a police station, but blew himself up "200 metres (yards) away
from it near the residental area of Al-Tamim."
