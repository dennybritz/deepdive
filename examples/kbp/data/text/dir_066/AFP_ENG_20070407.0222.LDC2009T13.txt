An advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denied on
Saturday that 15 British sailors and marines seized by Iran had
been mistreated, saying they had made such claims under pressure
from their superiors.


"The mistreatment of the sailors is a lie," said Ali Akbar
Javanfekr, top press spokesman for the president.


"The British authorities should know that they cannot keep hiding
the truth from the British people," he said.


"We envisioned that the 15 sailors would be subjected to pressure
by British security and intelligence forces. For that reason,
President Ahmadinejad asked Prime Minister Tony Blair not to put
pressure on the sailors for having told the truth, but (he) did
not hear this humanitarian appeal, Javanfekr said.
