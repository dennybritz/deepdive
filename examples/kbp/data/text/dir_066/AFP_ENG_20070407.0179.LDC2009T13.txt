North Korea's top sports official said Saturday that Pyongyang
backs South Korea's bid to host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.


"I hope the 2014 Winter Olympic Games goes to Pyeongchang," Jang
Ung, the North's International Olympic Committee (IOC) member,
told journalists in the eastern city of Chuncheon.


Pyeonchang, some 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Seoul,
narrowly missed out to Vancouver for the 2010 event. It is
competing this time against Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi
and Salzburg in Austria.


The final decision is to be made on July 4 at a general assembly
in Guatemala City.


Japan is the only Asian nation that has hosted the Winter
Olympics, in 1972 in Sapporo and in Nagano in 1998.


Jang arrived here Friday heading a delegation for talks on
launching a united governing body for taekwondo.


Jang heads the International Taekwondo Federation, which is run
by North Korea. It opened a branch in Seoul in January.


On Sunday, Jang is scheduled to meet Choue Chung-Won, head of the
World Taekwondo Federation, which is led by South Korea.


The two federations agreed in Qatar last December to form a
coordinating body to discuss a merger. Its first meeting will be
in Beijing on March 31.
