A Saudi man convicted of murder was executed by the sword on
Saturday near Islam's holiest city of Mecca, the interior
ministry said.


Hatem Ben Mohammed al-Mostadi was condemned to death by beheading
for shooting dead Massud bin Ali al-Jahni, said a ministry
statement carried by the official SPA news agency.


The execution brings to 29 the number of death sentences carried
out by the Saudi authorities so far this year.


In 2006 at least 37 people were executed, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public by decapitation in
ultra- conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of
sharia, or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.


Human Rights Watch, the New York-based human rights watchdog, has
called on Saudi Arabia to halt all executions.
