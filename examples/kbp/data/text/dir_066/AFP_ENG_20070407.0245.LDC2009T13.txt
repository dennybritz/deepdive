A 17-year-old Swedish girl has gone missing in Syria, the Swedish
foreign ministry said on Saturday.


"Interpol and Syrian police are working on the case. The Swedish
embassy and the foreign ministry are involved as well,"
spokeswoman Petra Hansson told AFP.


"We are doing research to try to find out what happened, we do
not know where she is and we do not know what happened but we are
trying to find out."


According to the Swedish tabloid Expressen, the girl was
kidnapped during the early hours of March 9 while she was on
holiday.


Her family, who live in Sweden, are said to have received an
anonymous call saying she is being held by four men and one woman
in Syria, the tabloid said.
