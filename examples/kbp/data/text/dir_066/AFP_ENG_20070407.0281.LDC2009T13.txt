A Soyuz rocket bearing US-Hungarian space tourist Charles Simonyi
and two Russian cosmonauts blasted off at 11:31 p.m. local time
(1731 GMT) Saturday from the Russian space centre here.


The rocket took off on schedule, carrying a TMA-10 space capsule
with Simonyi, Oleg Kotov and Fyodor Yurchikhin toward the
International Space Station (ISS).


A few minutes later officials confirmed the craft had
successfully entered orbit.


Simonyi, 58, is a former pioneer at US software giant Microsoft
who paid about 25 million dollars (19 billion euros) to fly to
the ISS.


He is due to dock at the space station on Monday, where he will
spend 10 days conducting experiments and recording his
impressions.


Speaking before the blast off, his spokeswoman, Susan Hutchinson,
said the billionaire programmer felt "very comfortable about the
flight."


"He is very pleased with all the training process.... He's going
into it very confident."


He is scheduled to return to Earth on April 20 together with the
current ISS team -- Russia's Mikhail Tyurin and American Miguel
Lopez-Alegria -- while the two Russian cosmonauts stay on for a
190-day shift in orbit.
