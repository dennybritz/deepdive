An Israeli Arab visiting his wife and children in the Gaza Strip
was kidnapped on Saturday night by four armed men outside the
family house, relatives said.


Jihad Ziyara, 46, lives in the Israeli port city of Jaffa, near
Tel Aviv. His wife, a native of Gaza, does not have permission to
live in Israel and still resides in Gaza, one of her cousins
explained.


No one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, and there
was no immediate comment from the police.


Around 1.2 million Arabs live in Israel and are often considered
as collaborators of the Jewish state because they hold its
citizenship.
