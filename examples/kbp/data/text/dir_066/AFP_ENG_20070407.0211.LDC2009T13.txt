Some 40 people have been killed and more than 70 injured in
fierce sectarian clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in
northern Pakistan, officials said Saturday.


"So far we have received reports that 40 people have been killed
in clashes in two days of fighting between two religious groups
in Parachinar," said Arif Habib, a top official dealing with
security in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.


Local officials said more than 70 people were also injured in the
fighting.


Parachinar, a tribal town close to the Afghan border in
Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, has a history of
sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite communities.


It was placed under curfew on Friday after fighting erupted
between the rival groups and troops were deployed to restore
order.


Officials said the soldiers had been given shoot-on-sight orders
to curb the violence.
