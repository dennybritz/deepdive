Two Turkish soldiers and two Kurdish rebels were killed in
clashes in southeastern Turkey, security officials said Saturday.


The clashes between the members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK) and Turkish forces happened late Friday in the areas of
Bitlis and Sirnak near the Iraq border, officials said, adding
that four others were injured.


The PKK announced a ceasefire last October, but Turkish
authorities rejected it. Violence related to the conflict has
since reduced, however.


More than 37,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the PKK
took up arms for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast of
Turkey.


The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the
United States and the European Union.
