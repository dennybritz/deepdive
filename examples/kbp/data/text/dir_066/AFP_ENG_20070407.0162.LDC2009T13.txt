the toss against Bangladesh in the World Cup Super Eights match
here on Saturday.


South Africa have already earned four points after beating Sri
Lanka and Ireland in the second round, while Bangladesh have yet
to open their account.

Nel for the only change from the team that beat debutants Ireland
in the last match here.


Bangladesh retained the side that lost to New Zealand in the last
game.
