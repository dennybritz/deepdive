Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko vowed on Saturday to press
ahead with an order to dissolve parliament that has plunged this
former Soviet republic into a political crisis.


"My decision is legitimate and constitutional and there will be
no going back," Yushchenko said during a televised speech in the
Ukrainian capital Kiev to mark the Easter holiday.


In a firm rebuttal to Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, who has
defied the president's orders, Yushchenko said his ruling to
dissolve parliament and hold snap elections on May 27 was aimed
against "tyranny."


The president has said he was forced to act because pro-Russian
forces in parliament led by Yanukovych's Regions party were
violating the constitution and trying to lure pro-Western
deputies over to their camp.


Some analysts have warned of possible clashes in the current
stand-off. But Yushchenko promised there would be no violence.


"There will be no civil conflict or insecurity. I guarantee that.
The forces of law and order strictly carry out the orders of the
president," Yushchenko said.


In his speech, he turned down Yanukovych's proposal to bring in
international mediators to help resolve the power struggle.


"We will find a solution to our problems ourselves," Yushchenko
said.


Yushchenko also appealed to the thousands of protesters who have
come out in Kiev this week to rally against his leadership to
stop demonstrating and join in holiday celebrations.


Yushchenko issued his order on Monday, triggering the current
crisis.
