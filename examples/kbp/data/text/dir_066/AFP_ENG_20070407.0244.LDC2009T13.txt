French right-wing presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy faced
criticism on Saturday for recent comments about pedophilia and
suicide, with an archbishop denouncing his statements.


Sarkozy said recently in an interview with the French magazine
Philosophie that he was "inclined to think that people are born
paedophiles, and that it is also a problem that we do not know
how to manage."


He also told the magazine: "There are 1,200 or 1,300 young people
who commit suicide in France every year. It's not because of a
lack of attention from their parents. It's because, genetically,
they are fragile and have a pre-existing sadness."


Archbishop of Paris Andre Vingt-Trois disputed the comments
Saturday on RTL radio, saying that mankind has free will.


"What seems most serious to me is the idea that we cannot change
the course of existence," he said. "To say that someone is
predetermined by the family that surrounds him, by the conditions
in which he lives, means that man is absolutely conditioned."


Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou has called
Sarkozy's comments "terribly worrying" and "chilling."


A co-director for the campaign of Socialist candidate Segolene
Royal said he found them "surprising," while Royal herself said
she would leave it to scientists to respond.


First-round voting in France's presidential campaign will be held
April 22.


Sarkozy, who polls show is leading the race, has gained a
reputation for making controversial comments. He recently drew
heavy criticism over his proposal to create a ministry of
immigration and national identity.
