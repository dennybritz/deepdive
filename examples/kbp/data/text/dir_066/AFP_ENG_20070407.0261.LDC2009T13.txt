Doubles duo Thomas Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman booked Sweden's
spot in the Davis Cup semi-finals with a day to spare on Saturday
as the hosts took an unbeatable 3-0 lead over last year's
runners-up Argentina.


Bjorkman and Johansson defeated David Nalbandian and Guillermo
Canas 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2, 6-3 in just under three hours to put
Sweden into the last four for the first time since 2001.


There they will meet the winner of the tie between the United
States and Spain which is being played this weekend at Winston-
Salem, North Carolina.


Sweden won both Friday's opening singles on the indoors carpet
surface when Johansson beat Nalbandian 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7/2), 6-2,
7-6 (7/0) and Robin Soderling got the better of Juan Martin del
Potro 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.


The South Americans enjoyed a 5-0 whitewash against the Swedes in
Buenos Aires in the opening round of last year's competition.


But world number 12 Nalbandian was far from his top level after
suffering a series of injuries during the winter.


Despite Nalbandian and Canas dominating the first set, which they
wrapped up in less than 30 minutes, the Swedes fought back in the
second, relying mainly on their solid service games.


"I knew this morning that it could be a bit tough but we knew how
to make the difference," said 2002 Australian Open champion
Johansson, who has dropped to 73rd in the world rankings.


Sunday's now meaningless reverse singles will now be played in
two sets with Soderling against Nalbandian and Johansson to meet
del Potro.
