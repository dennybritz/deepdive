Thailand's military-backed government could still declare a state
of emergency in Bangkok if anti-coup protests escalate, the
defence minister said Saturday.


Thai junta leader, General Sonthi Boonyaratglin urged the
government to declare an emergency last month, in the face of
small but growing protests against the coup.


But army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont refused,
saying the situation was still under control, but left the option
on the table.


Anti-coup protesters led by allies of deposed premier Thaksin
Shinawatra plan a new rally on Sunday, and the defence minister
said a state of emergency would be declared if the situation got
out of control.


"We will first apply the law to manage the protests in Bangkok,"
defence minister Boonrawd Somtas said during a government TV
programme.


"If the situation gets out of control, we must use the emergency
rules," he said.


Protests in recent weeks have attracted a few thousand people,
many of them supporters of the deposed premier.


But the protest movement is beginning to create an odd coalition
of allies, with some pro-democracy groups who last year protested
against Thaksin now joining forces with his allies in rallying
against the junta.


Chief among the concerns of the protesters is a new constitution
being drafted by a panel hand-picked by the junta, which critics
fear will merely cement the military's role in government.
