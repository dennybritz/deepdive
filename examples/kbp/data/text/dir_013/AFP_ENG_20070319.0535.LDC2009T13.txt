The World Health Organization on Monday pledged millions of
emergency vaccines to counter a meningitis epidemic in Burkina
Faso which has killed at least 583 people.


The WHO said 3.35 million vaccines would be sent to the west
African nation, where 7,333 suspected cases of meningitis were
registered between January 1 and March 11.


About 1.16 million vaccines were expected to arrive this week.


The UN agency said in a statement that poverty-hit Burkina Faso
urgently needs 1.2 million dollars (900,000 euros) for the
vaccination campaign.


Burkina Faso, one of the world's poorest nations, is on the so-
called "meningitis belt" that runs from Senegal across the
southern Sahara to Ethiopia, meningitis is a major problem.


The disease usually breaks out during the December-January dry
season when it is carried by warm, dry winds.


Meningitis, which is an airborne virus, infects the brain and
spinal cord. Its symptoms include fever, rashes and vomiting.
