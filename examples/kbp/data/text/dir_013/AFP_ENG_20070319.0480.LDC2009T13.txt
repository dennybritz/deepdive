Italian Matteo Bono of the Lampre team won the 162km sixth stage
of the Tirreno- Adriatico cycling race between San Benedetto del
Tronto and San Giacomo-Monti della Laga on Monday.


Astana rider Andreas Kloden of Germany grabbed the overall race
lead after he finished the stage in ninth place.


Bono, who has only two professional seasons under his belt and
claimed the first win of his professional career, set the pace on
the final 11km climb to San Giacomo-Monti della Laga.


The 23-year-old Lampre rider kicked into action with four
kilometres to the line and left the breakaway group, which had
formed at 27km and included compatriots Enrico Gasparotto and
Giovanni Visconti, in his wake.


Bono eventually crossed the finish line at the 1105 metre summit
32 seconds ahead of Gasparotto with Visconti 41 seconds back.


The battle for the leader's jersey turned in favour of Kloden
after Gerolsteiner's Stefan Schumacher, who started the day
overall leader, finished down in 19th place 25 seconds off
Kloden's pace.


Kloden now leads the field by a mere three seconds over
T-Mobile's Kim Kirchen and third-placed Alexandre Vinokourov at
12 seconds with the two stages remaining.
