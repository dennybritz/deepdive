Real Madrid midfielder and former England captain David Beckham
insists he has not given up hope of convincing Steve McClaren to
recall him to the national squad.


Speaking on a visit to a school in Bristol to launch a new
website for schools, www.thedavidbeckhamacademy.co.uk, Beckham
said: "I have always said I will be available for my country and
that still stands.


"I'm not reconciled to not being part of the squad and it's
always tough when it comes to international week and I'm not
involved but there have been a few of those now so I'm becoming
accustomed to spending time with the family or doing different
things.


"I've never been a great spectator even when I was a young kid. I
hated watching the games when I felt I could be playing. Of
course I will watch the England games though - I'll sit and watch
them with the family."


England play Israel on March 24 and then Andorra four days later
in Group E Euro 2008 qualifiers.


A couple of poor performances could seriously jeopardise
England's chance of reaching the finals next year in Austria and
Switzerland.
