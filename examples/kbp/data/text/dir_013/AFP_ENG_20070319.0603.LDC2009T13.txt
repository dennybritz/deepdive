Canada's defense minister on Monday apologized for giving false
information to lawmakers regarding the transfer of Afghan
prisoners captured by Canadian troops to local authorities.


Gordon O'Connor has repeatedly responded to criticism by rights
groups who fear the transfers could lead to torture by saying the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) would alert
Canada in case of any mistreatment.


"I fully and without reservation apologize to the House for
providing inaccurate information to members. I regret any
confusion that may have resulted from these statements," O'Connor
said.


"The International Committee of the Red Cross provides this
information to the country that has the detainees in its custody,
in this case, Afghanistan," he said, adding that his earlier
statements had been made "in good faith."


O'Connor was forced to retract his statements after an ICRC
spokesman was quoted in the Globe and Mail daily as saying there
existed no such agreement with Canada and that third party
countries were never informed of the results of its visits with
prisoners.


Rights groups have said a prisoner transfer agreement between
Ottawa and Afghanistan's government signed in December 2005 does
not provide "adequate safeguards to ensure that detainees will
not be tortured by Afghan forces."


Canada has 2,500 soldiers deployed in southern Afghanistan.


Since 2002, 45 Canadian soldiers and one senior diplomat have
died in skirmishes with Taliban militants or in roadside blasts.
