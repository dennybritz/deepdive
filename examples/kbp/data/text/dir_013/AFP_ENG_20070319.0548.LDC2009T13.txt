Qatar can cope with an 18-month interruption in its oil and gas
exports in case of a regional conflict resulting from the Iran
nuclear standoff with the West, the finance minister said Monday.


"We can last for 18 months without exporting a drop of oil or any
gas," said Yussef Hussein Kamal at a conference, addressing the
impact of a possible war in the Gulf region.


"We have lived for over 30 years in the same atmosphere and
tension," he said, referring to a chain of crises and military
conflicts in the region including the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.


Kamal boasted that the economy of the gas-rich state has grown
rapidly during the past 12 years, surging from five billion
dollars in 1995 to 52 billion dollars in the financial year 2006.


Gulf countries fear that any conflict between Western powers and
Iran over its controversial nuclear programme would impact other
states in the region.


Washington fears Iran is secretly developing an atomic weapon, a
charge Iran strongly denies, insisting its nuclear programme is
for peaceful energy production only.


Qatar sits on top of 15 percent of world proven gas reserves.
