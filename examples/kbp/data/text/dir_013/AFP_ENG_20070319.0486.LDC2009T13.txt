Newcastle's Turkish midfielder Emre was on Monday cleared of
racially abusing an opponent after a Football Association
investigation.


The 26-year-old had been charged with using racially-aggravated
abusive and/or insulting words during an English Premiership
match at Everton in December.


Emre denied the allegations and had claimed he would quit England
if he was found guilty.


An FA statement said: "Having heard all the evidence presented,
and having regard to the standard of proof agreed with both the
FA and Newcastle United, we were not satisfied that the charge
was proved."


The news comes the same day that German newspaper BZ claimed the
Turkey international is being tracked by Hertha Berlin.


BZ claimed the transfer of Emre depends on the departure of
another Turkish midfielder, Yildiray Basturk.


"If Yil goes, we'll sign a real star," said Hertha manager Dieter
Hoeness, quoted in the newspaper.


BZ also said that Hertha's coach Falko Gotz knows Emre's agent
Ahmet Bulut well, having worked with him at Galatasaray.
