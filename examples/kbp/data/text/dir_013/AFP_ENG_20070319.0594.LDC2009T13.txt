Flamboyant Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh said he was delighted with
his World Cup 46-ball 83 against Bermuda which included seven
massive sixes.


Coming in at number five, Yuvraj and Sachin Tendulkar added 122
for the fifth wicket off just 62 balls. Tendulkar made a 29-ball
57 not out with four sixes.


India, in a must-win situation after being upset by Bangladesh in
their previous Group B game, found the going easy against Bermuda
and eventually won by 257 runs.


Yuvraj came to the crease with the score at 238-3 after Sourav
Ganguly and Virender Sehwag shared a second-wicket partnership of
202.


"The wicket was slow but as I got my eye in I played my shots,"
said Yuvraj.


He was not wrong about that, hitting three fours and seven sixes
in his quick- fire knock, many through mid-wicket.


"I just went in there thinking about batting to the 50th over,"
he said.


"I played my shots a little late in the innings. But after my
first hit, I felt confident in the mid-wicket area and I just
went for my shots."


Yuvraj said he was happy to be back on the square after making a
recent return to fitness after tearing a ligament in the left
knee at a practice session during the Champions Trophy in
November which forced him to miss a tour of South Africa.


On his return, he smashed a blistering 95 not out to guide India
to a series- clinching seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the
fourth and final one-dayer last month.


"I am batting well and looking forward to the next one (against
Sri Lanka on Friday)," he added.
