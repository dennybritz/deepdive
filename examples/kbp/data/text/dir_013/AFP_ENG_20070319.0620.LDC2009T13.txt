Eli Manning is set to throw passes for the New York Giants for
another three seasons after the National Football League squad
exercised a contract option on him here Monday.


The Giants spent a reported five million dollars on a buy-back
option to the quarterback's contract to deny Manning a chance to
void the final two years of a six-year deal worth up to 54
million dollars, locking him in through 2009.


That contract included an American football rookie-record signing
bonus of 20 million dollars.


Manning, 26, could have become a free agent after the 2007 season
but the Giants decided to keep him despite struggles in the 2006
season.


The Giants went 8-8 and made the playoff for the second year in a
row while Manning threw for 3,244 yards and 24 touchdowns with 18
interceptions.
