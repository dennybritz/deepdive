A detained German truck driver is suspected of being behind at
least 19 murders over more than 30 years in Germany, France and
Spain, the European justice coordination agency Eurojust said
here on Monday.


The 48-year-old suspect was arrested in November "thanks to
successful investigations by the Spanish authorities," Eurojust
said.


He is "suspected of having committed at least 19 murders between
1974, when the suspect was 15 years old, and 2006,", it said.


The suspect, whose identity has not been released, was recorded
by a CCTV camera from a private Spanish company while disposing
of one of his victims, most of whom were prostitutes.


He was identified and arrested by German police after Spanish
authorities had issued a European arrest warrant, according to
Eurojust.


When confronted with the evidence, the agency said the suspect
allegedly confessed to five murders in Spain and France as well
as one in Germany, when he was 15 and the victim was 14 years
old.


The crimes took place in the Spanish regions of Barcelona and
Figueras, Plauen in Germany and Saintes and Reims in France,
Eurojust said, adding that other unsolved cases in Europe were
being investigated.
