The Nashville Predators, who have the best record in the National
Hockey League, will try to play without Canadian right wing
Jordin Tootoo for the next five games.


The NHL suspended Tootoo for five games here on Monday for
striking Dallas defenseman Stephane Robidas in a 3-2 home victory
over the Stars on Saturday.


Tootoo will lose 16,032 dollars for the roughing blow, which came
with 3:39 remaining in the third period and resulted in a double
minor penalty.


"Stephane Robidas appeared to be initiating a confrontation by
approaching Jordin Tootoo," NHL vice president Colin Campbell
said.


"While a player is entitled to defend himself, Mr. Tootoo's
forceful blow to Robidas' head was an overly aggressive and
inappropriate response.


"The fact Mr. Tootoo's actions resulted in an injury to his
opponent also was a factor in this decision."


Tootoo will miss games Wednesday at Vancouver, Thursday at
Calgary, Saturday at Edmonton, March 27 at home against Edmonton
and March 29 at hoem against Detroit, a team the Predators lead
in the Western Conference by only one point.


Nashville has a league-high 47 triumphs with only nine games
remaining in the regular season but the Predators are being
chased for home-ice advantage through the playoffs by Detroit and
Anaheim, which os only two points back.


Tootoo, 24, has three goals and four assists in 61 games this
season.
