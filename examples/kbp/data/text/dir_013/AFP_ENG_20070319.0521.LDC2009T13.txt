The United Nations said Monday it was establishing thousands of
literacy centres across Afghanistan with 90 percent of women in
rural areas unable to read.


The centres were part of the United Nations Children's Fund plan
to support education in Afghanistan this year, it said.


The plan covers the establishment of 4,000 literacy centres
throughout Afghanistan, UNICEF education chief David McLoughlin
told reporters.


According to UN data, "90 percent of rural women and 65 percent
of rural men are illiterate still in Afghanistan," he said.


Girls were banned from going to school by the Taliban which was
in power between 1996 and 2001.


After the collapse of Taliban regime they have returned to
classes although efforts to get children back in school have been
troubled by militant attacks, including the murder of teachers
and the burning of facilities.


The number of attacks on schools dropped to 120 in 2006 from more
than double that the previous year, McLoughlin said.


More than six million children would this year be in school, due
to open March 21, which was "something very historical for his
country and very encouraging for the education system," he said.


The British-based charity Oxfam said in November however that
about about seven million children, about half the school-age
population, were still not in school.
