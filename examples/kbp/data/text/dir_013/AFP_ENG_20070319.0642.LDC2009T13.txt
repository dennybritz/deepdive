The government of Guinea-Bissau lost a vote of confidence on
Monday and now has three days to hand over power to a coalition
government.


Lawmakers voted 54 to 28 against Prime Minister Aristide Gomes'
administration, with eight deputies abstaining and ten others
absent.


The vote followed a decision by the three biggest political
parties, who between them hold 97 of the 100 seats in the
national assembly, to push for a new "government of consensus" in
the interests of parliamentary stability.


Under the terms of the Guinea-Bissau constitution, President Joao
Bernardo Vieira must now dissolve the government within 72 hours.


"The government does not have legitimacy starting today," said
Joao Sediba Sani, the parliamentary leader of the African Party
for the Independence of Guinea- Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC),
following the vote.


However, the secretary to the national assembly, Armando Procel,
complained of irregularities during the vote motion and vowed the
government would appeal the decision in the Supreme Court.


Gomes was appointed prime minister in November 2005 over the
objections of the PAIGC. He replaced Carlos Gomes Junior, who was
sacked following a series of disputes with President Vieira.


Vieira was overthrown from power in 1999 after 19 years of iron-
fisted rule, but controversially returned from exile in Portugal
to run for the presidency as an independent in 2005.


However, since then he has had problems getting support in
parliament, in a power struggle that has weakened the
impoverished west African country.
