The first leg of Tottenham's UEFA Cup quarter-final, first leg at
Sevilla has fallen in the middle of a holy week in Spain and the
town's mayor is trying to change the date.


Alfonso Rodriguez Gomez de Celis even joked at a press conference
he could invite UEFA president Michel Platini to the holy
procession on Thursday April 5, the date of the match, to show
him how important it was.


The return match is a week later at Tottenham's White Hart Lane
ground.


"The ideal thing would be for the match not to be played during
the holy week," Gomez de Celis said. "But that is going to be
very difficult."
