British headteachers will be awarded the right to ban the Muslim
veil or any other religious clothing from their classrooms if
they feel they are impeding learning, according to government
guidelines to be revealed on Tuesday.


A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills, however,
stressed that the new guidelines did not mean that the government
was imposing a blanket ban on religious clothing at schools, but
was instead leaving the decision in the hands of school heads.


The new rules follow a high-profile court case here in which the
father of a 12 -year-old Muslim girl was last month refused
permission by London's High Court to challenge a school's ban on
her wearing the full-face veil, or niqab, during lessons.


The guidelines require schools to consult with the local
community, including the parents of students, before deciding on
a uniform policy, and note that, where possible, they should try
and be tolerant of particular religious dress.


Certain items of clothing, however, such as the niqab, may be
banned if headteachers believe that they hamper safety, security
or learning, so long as a consultation is carried out.
