US President George W. Bush and Indonesian President Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono on Monday discussed efforts to get a new UN
resolution on Iran's nuclear pograms, the White House said.


The two leaders "talked about UN Security Council efforts,
including the current draft resolution designed to address Iran's
continued failure to respond to concerns from the international
community over Iran's nuclear program," Bush spokesman Tony Snow
told reporters.


Indonesia currently holds one of the council's rotating seats.


Bush and Yudhoyono also "discussed their mutual hope for a
positive, ambitious outcome from this week's meeting of the G-33
trade ministers in Jakarta," said Snow.
