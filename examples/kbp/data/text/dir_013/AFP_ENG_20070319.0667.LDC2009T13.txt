Australia's former head coach Don Talbot believes Germany should
be taken up on its offer of more drug testing as a massive anti-
doping operation swings into action at the World Swimming
Championships.


German coach Orjan Madsen on Sunday used a press conference here
to call for more drug testing of his swimmers in a bid to end
suspicion surrounding the country's record-breaking women.


The previously-unheralded German women, led by Britta Steffen,
raised eyebrows last year when they broke three world records at
the European championships in Budapest.


Talbot, who steered Australia to pool domination at the 2000
Sydney Olympics and 2001 world championships in Japan, said he
was pleased the Germans were taking a proactive attitude towards
doping.


But he told the Herald Sun newspaper that more needed to be done.


"I think they (anti-doping agencies) should take them up on it,"
Talbot said.


"I would have been happier if he did what Ian Thorpe did and say,
'We will subject ourselves to blood tests as well as the standard
testing'.


"If he was prepared to do that, I think that would be a great
thing for him, particularly if he is trying to clear the team.


"It's not unprecedented, but I think when you are in the hot seat
like they are, it's not a bad move.


"I know him well and he wouldn't make that statement if he wasn't
legitimate," he added.


The comments come as a huge drug-testing program gets underway at
the World Swimming Championships here, although FINA, world
swimming's governing body, has refused to say how many tests were
being conducted or on whom.
