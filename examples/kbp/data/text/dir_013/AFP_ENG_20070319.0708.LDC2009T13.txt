Mainland flag carrier Air China announced Tuesday an 11.7 percent
rise in 2006 net profit to 2.7 billion yuan (347 million dollars
as increased passenger traffic offset the impact of higher jet
fuel prices.


Operating revenue grew 17.4 percent to 44.9 billion yuan, while
total expenses rose 22.5 percent to 42.4 billion yuan due to
increases in the price and consumption of jet fuel.


However, the airline said easier oil prices in the second half of
the year brought some relief.


"2006 was a critical year for the company," said company chairman
Li Jiaxiang, highlighting its A-share listing in Shanghai which
had helped raise the funds used for the company to expand its
fleet by 31 aircraft.


Air China said it carried 33.97 million passengers in 2006, up
14.2 percent, giving a passenger load factor, a measure of how
full its flights were, up 1.9 percentage points to 75.9 percent.


During the year, the company introduced 35 new routes and began
new international services including flights from Beijing to Ho
Chi Ming city, Delhi, Madrid and Sao Palo.


Looking forward, Li was optimistic.


"Although the high price of jet fuel creates significant cost a
pressure, (China's) economy has maintained its fast pace of
growth and has been the driving force behind our rapid growth,"
he said.


He said he expected the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing to boost
the airline's business opportunities.
