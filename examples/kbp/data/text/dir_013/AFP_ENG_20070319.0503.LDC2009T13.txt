Iraq will execute Saddam Hussein's aide and former vice president
Taha Yassin Ramadan early on Tuesday for crimes against humanity,
a lawyer from the executed dictator's defence team told AFP on
Monday.


"The Americans called Ramadan's lawyer and asked him to be ready
as Ramadan was to be hanged tomorrow at 2:30 am (2330 GMT
Monday)," lawyer Badie Aref said, adding that he was told about
the planned execution by Ramadan's lawyer whom he refused to
identify.


"They (US military) also allowed Ramadan to call his family. He
was very calm and composed. He asked his family and friends to
pray for him and said that he was not afraid of death."


Ramadan will be the third aide of Saddam to be hanged for crimes
against humanity over his role in the killing of 148 Shiites from
the town of Dujail in the 1980s where Saddam had escaped an
assassination bid.


Saddam himself was hanged for the Dujail killings on December 30
and was later followed to the gallows by two of his henchmen,
Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad Ahmed al-Bandar on January 15.
