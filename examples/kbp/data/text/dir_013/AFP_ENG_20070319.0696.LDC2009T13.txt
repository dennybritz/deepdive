European 200m breaststroke champion Kirsty Balfour has conceded
that Australian world record holder Leisel Jones will be
unstoppable at the World Swimming Championships.


Jones holds the records over 100m and 200m and is hot favourite
to take both titles in Melbourne.


"Realistically, you can say Leisel is likely to win and then
there are three battling for the next places," Balfour, whose
best 200m time is almost four seconds behind Jones, told
reporters.


Nevertheless Balfour, who broke through last year by claiming the
European title, said she was not afraid of Jones and looked
forward to giving her a race.


"I don't feel daunted, I admire her," said the Scot.


"I think it's good to have someone so good as a swimmer as she
pushes everyone else."


The women's 200m breaststroke final takes place here on March 30.
