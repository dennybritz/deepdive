Wall Street shares raced higher Monday, with the leading Dow
Jones Industrial Average ending up over 100 points, boosted by a
number of meger and acquisition announcements, traders said.


The Dow blue-chip index gained 115.76 points (0.96 percent) to
12,226.17 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite finished 21.75 points (0.92 percent) higher
at 2,394.41 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 spiked
15.11 points (1.09 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,402.06.


Stocks gained as ServiceMaster, which makes garden treatment
products and home cleaning solutions, announced it had agreed to
be taken over by the Clayton, Dublilier and Rice investment fund
for 5.5 billion dollars.


Traders said news reports suggesting British bank Barclays has
approached Dutch financial group ABN Amro with a 155-billion-
dollar merger proposal had also lifted sentiment.


Traders said they were also awaiting the opening of Tuesday's two
day meeting of the Federal Reserve at which the central bank is
widely expected to keep its short term interest rate anchored at
5.25 percent.
