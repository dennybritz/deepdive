Real Betis's French striker Fabrice Pancrate, who injured his
right knee in a Spanish league match at Real Mallorca at the
weekend, will be out for up to eight weeks.


Pancrate, loaned by Paris Saint Germain in the last few hours of
the winter transfer window, got injured in a clash with Mallorca
defender Fernando Navarro in the first half of Betis's 2-0 defeat
on Saturday.
