Economic growth in recent years has helped reduce poverty in
Latin America, but an "unacceptable" 205 million people in the
region still live in poverty, the head of the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) said on Monday.


"Thanks to this situation, the percentage of Latin Americans
living below the poverty and extreme poverty lines is the lowest
in recent history," IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno said at the
opening of a meeting in Guatemala City of the bank's board of
governors.


"Even though 13 million Latin Americans have escaped from the
clutches of poverty in recent years, the current economic
expansion has not been reflected in an improvement of the quality
of life for a large number of our inhabitants. Inequality
continues. It is unacceptable that 205 million people live below
the poverty line," he said.


"The major challenge for our countries over the next years should
be to ensure that the benefits of growth are felt in every home
of the region, and to achieve this, equal opportunities have to
be a top goal."
