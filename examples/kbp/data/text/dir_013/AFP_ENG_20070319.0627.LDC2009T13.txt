Juventus cruised six points clear of Napoli at the top of the
Serie B on Monday after a 5-1 drubbing of Triestina.


The 22-year-old Raffaele Palladino, who was standing in for the
suspended French striker David Trezeguet, was in blistering form
for the promotion hopefuls, netting a hat-trick.


However it was the visitors that got off the mark first seven
minutes into the game with Frederico Piovaccari finding the back
of the net.


The response was immediate with verteran midfielder Mauro
Camoranesi heading the home side level one minute later.


Palladino scored the next three for Juventus in what became a
one-sided affair and 21-year-old Bulgarian international Valeri
Bojinov wrapped up the game nine minutes from time.
