A retired couple from the northeastern US state of New Jersey
stepped forward Monday as the joint winners of a 390-million-
dollar lottery jackpot earlier this month.


"This is that early retirement we've always dreamed of -- now we
can do all those things we said we would do once we retired,"
said winner Harold Messner, with a fair measure of
understatement.


By opting for the cash prize, rather than annual installments, he
and his wife Elaine walked away with some 88 million dollars
after tax.


The couple had waited almost two weeks after the March 6 draw to
let the news sink in and seek professional advice, Messner said
in a statement.


"My wife and I are good with money, but when you're talking 88
million dollars, it's always a good idea to let someone who
manages money for a living lend a hand."


"We have some ideas about what we want to do with this big win,
but haven't made any big decisions yet," he added.


The couple bought the winning ticket at a liquor store in New
Jersey, Messner said, describing the shock of realizing he was
holding the winning ticket.


"I checked the last number twice, called for my wife and told her
we won.  She had a very hard time believing it," he said.


"We didn't sleep for the rest of the night."


A spokesman for the couple declined to give any personal details
about the Messners, who shared the jackpot with a truck driver
from the southern state of Georgia.
