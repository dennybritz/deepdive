Britain's Prince Harry is undergoing his last major stint of army
training before he and his regiment are deployed to Iraq within a
couple of months, the Ministry of Defence said Monday.


Harry has joined around 3,500 other soldiers at the army training
ground on Salisbury Plain, southwest England, for a week of mock-
up situations including arresting insurgents and facing mortar
fire.


The exercises, conducted in bitterly-cold winds, are designed to
be as realistic as possible to prepare soldiers for the harsh
reality of life in Iraq.


The 22-year-old prince -- the first British royal to serve in a
war since his uncle Prince Andrew flew helicopters in the 1982
Falklands conflict -- has reportedly already had special hostage
training.


"There's an exercise going on and I understand that Prince Harry
is down there and it's preparation for the deployment to Iraq,"
an MoD spokesman told AFP.


He added that the week-long exercise would "probably be the last
major one before they go out there" around May.


Harry, a second lieutenant in the Blues and Royals regiment, is
set to deploy to southeast Iraq.
