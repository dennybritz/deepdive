An outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley Fever has killed at least
16 people and infected dozens others in Tanzania over the past
two months, officials said Monday.


Health Minister David Mwakyusa said the country's central region
of Dodoma, about 450 kilometres (281 miles) north of the
commercial capital Dar es Salaam, was the most hit.


"Dodoma is the most affected region, 13 people died there
recently and there are 41 patients with RVF related symptoms who
are still admitted to hospitals," Mwakyusa told reporters.


Three more deaths were reported in other regions where many have
shown symptoms.


The disease killed at least 170 people in neighbouring Kenya
before it was put under control last month. Other deaths have
been reported in Somalia.


There are no vaccines for humans, but health experts have advised
the public to eat inspected meat, avoid human-animal contact,
bury or burn dead animals and observe basic hygiene.


Tanzanian officials said vaccines have been distributed across
the country.


Victims of RFV usually experience fever, generalized weakness,
back pain, dizziness, vomiting of blood and extreme weight loss
at the onset of the illness.


Many patients recover within a week but others can die, including
those with weakened immune systems, experts say.


The fever was first isolated in Kenya's Rift Valley region in
1930s but has since been recorded elsewhere on the continent and
abroad.
