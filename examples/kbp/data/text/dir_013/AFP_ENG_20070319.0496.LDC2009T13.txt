The European Union decided to continue its temporary aid to the
new Palestinian government for three months, EU Commissioner for
External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner said here Monday.


"It is very important that at this delicate moment we at least
can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to
see that the Palestinian people will not suffer in this period
when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity
government," said Ferrero-Waldner.


The EU ceased direct aid to the Palestinian government when Hamas
came to power following last year's election and subsequently set
up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the Palestinians.
