Portugal's public deficit fell to 3.9 percent of gross domestic
product in 2006, lower than the 4.6 percent forecast by the
government, national statistics institute said on Monday.


Portugal posted a public deficit of 6.0 percent of GDP in 2005 --
double the EU ceiling of 3.0 percent imposed on the 13 countries
that use the euro currency.


Since coming to power in March 2005, Socialist Prime Minister
Jose Socrates has raised taxes, stepped up the fight against tax
evasion and reformed the public administration in a bid to bring
the deficit below the limit by the end of 2008.


Portugal's public deficit is forecast to fall from 3.7 percent
this year to 2.6 percent next year.
