West Indies opener Chris Gayle smashed three successive sixes in
one over on Monday and admitted he had wanted to equal Herschelle
Gibbs's record of six- in-a-row.


Gibbs created history last week when he became the first player
to hit six sixes in an over in a one-day international in South
Africa's win against the Netherlands.


Gayle was halfway there on Monday as West Indies beat Zimbabwe by
six wickets to reach the Super Eights when he hit three on the
trot against seamer Tawanda Mupariwa in the 14th over.


"I was thinking about Gibbs's record when I got the third, but
it's hard to hit the ball out of the ground here - the roof is
too high," said Gayle who made 40 to help West Indies on their
way in their Sabina Park victory.


West Indies have joined defending champions Australia in making
sure of their place in the next round.


Their final Group D fixture is against Ireland on Friday and
Gayle is keen for another win as they would carry an extra two
points into the Super Eights should the Irish also qualify.


"We won't be taking anything for granted against them," said
Gayle.
