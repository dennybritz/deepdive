A carpenter and his wife from the US state of New Jersey stepped
forward Monday as the joint winners of a 390-million-dollar
lottery jackpot and said they would never work again.


"This is that early retirement we've always dreamed of -- now we
can do all those things we said we would do once we retired,"
said winner Harold Messner.


By opting for the cash prize, rather than annual installments,
Messner and his wife Elaine, both in their mid-50s, walked away
with some 88 million dollars after tax.


The couple had waited almost two weeks after the March 6 draw to
let the news sink in and seek professional advice, Messner said
in a statement.


"My wife and I are good with money, but when you're talking 88
million dollars, it's always a good idea to let someone who
manages money for a living lend a hand."


"We have some ideas about what we want to do with this big win,
but haven't made any big decisions yet," he added.


The couple bought the winning ticket at a liquor store in New
Jersey, Messner said, recounting the shock of realizing he held
the winning ticket.


"I checked the last number twice, called for my wife and told her
we won.  She had a very hard time believing it," he said.


"We didn't sleep for the rest of the night."


The Messners share the jackpot with a truck driver from the
southern state of Georgia.
