A barrage of mortar shells crashed down into the seaport in
southern Mogadishu on Monday, triggering heavy fighting between
insurgents and Somali government troops, AFP correspondents
witnessed.


The artillery duel came hours after Somali and Ugandan troops
secured the seaport in southern Mogadishu ahead of the arrival of
military hardware for African Union peacekeepers deployed in the
volatile Somali capital.
