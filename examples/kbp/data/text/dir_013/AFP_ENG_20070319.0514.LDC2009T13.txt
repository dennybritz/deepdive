Perpignan coach Philippe Boher has announced he will leave the
top French rugby club at the end of the season because he was not
happy with the new contract he was offered.


The 38-year-old Boher was hoping to get a longer contract than
the one-year extension he was offered.


The Catalonian coach, who arrived at Perpignan at the beginning
of the 2004-2005 season, took the club to the semi-finals of the
French championship last year.


Boher, a former Perpignan and Brive player, has had a previous
spell as Perpignan coach and has also been the France under-21
team boss.
