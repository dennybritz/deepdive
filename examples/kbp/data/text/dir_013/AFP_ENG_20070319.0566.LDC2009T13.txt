Cobi Jones, who played in three World Cups for the United States,
will retire after the upcoming Major League Soccer season, the
Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder announced here Monday.


The 36-year-old veteran set an American record with 164 caps and
is the only MLS player to stay on the same club since the 1996
formation of the US league.


"I wanted to be competitive but I wanted to have fun as well and
I think I've accomplished both of those things," Jones said. "I
will never forget what 'The Beautiful Game' has given me."


Jones played a crucial role in the Galaxy's deal for England
football star David Beckham, who will join the Galaxy in July to
begin a 250 million-dollar deal once his contract expires with
Real Madrid.


"Having always respected Cobi's wisdom and advice, he was the
first person whose opinion I sought on whether or not to approach
David Beckham about playing for the Galaxy," said Galaxy
operators Anschutz Entertainment Group chief executive Tim
Leiweke.


"His valued counsel on this matter led us to pursue this bold and
unprecedented acquisition for soccer in the United States and the
Galaxy."


Wearing number 13, Jones helped the Galaxy win MLS titles in 2002
and 2005. His 66 goals and 281 games are club records.


"From the very beginning, Cobi Jones has been the heartbeat of
the Galaxy," Leiweke said. "He is the Galaxy."


Jones also played for England's Coventry City in 1994 and 1995
and for Brazil's Vasco da Game in 1995 and 1996.
