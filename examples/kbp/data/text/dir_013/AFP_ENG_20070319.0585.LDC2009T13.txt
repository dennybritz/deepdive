Canada unveiled its 10th consecutive budget surplus Monday, while
outlining an economic blueprint to end a fiscal imbalance which
has helped fuel Quebec separatists.


Finance Minister Jim Flaherty presented his economic plan in
Parliament, saying his government had taken "historic action to
restore fiscal balance in this country."


Government revenues are expected to climb to 236.7 billion
dollars (200.9 billion US) while spending would increase to 233.4
billion dollars (198.2 billion US), with the bulk of new spending
going to the provinces as lump sums.


The imbalance between Ottawa, awash in tax revenues, and Canada's
provinces struggling to pay for social services, has in part
fueled a separatist movement in French-speaking Quebec.


In this budget, the Conservative government will hand over 39
billion dollars over seven years to the provinces for roads and
public transit, post-secondary education, health care, job
training and the environment.


Canada's national debt meanwhile would be reduced by 9.2 billion
dollars (7.8 billion US) in 2006-07, and a further 3.0 billion
dollars (2.5 billion US) in following fiscal year.


Its debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio is expected to
fall to 31.4 percent, and is on track to meet the government's
target of 25 percent by 2012-13, Flaherty said.


The federal debt is currently estimated at 469.3 billion dollars
for 2007-08.


One billion dollars in personal and corporate tax cuts per year
are expected from debt interest savings, Flaherty said.
