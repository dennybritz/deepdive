Jordan's royal palace announced on Monday the birth of a boy to
Prince Ali bin Hussein, half-brother of King Abdullah II, and his
wife Rym Brahimi, a former CNN journalist.


The new prince has been named Abdullah and is the second child
for the royal couple. Their first, Princess Jalilia, was born on
September 17, 2005, a year after their marriage.


Princess Rym is the daughter of Lakhdar Brahimi, a former special
adviser to the United Nations secretary general and ex-Algerian
foreign minister.


Prince Ali, 32, is the son of the late King Hussein and Alia
Tukan, a Jordanian of Palestinian descent who was killed in a
helicopter crash in February 1977.


King Hussein married three times. King Abdullah is his son by the
late monarch's second wife, Briton Toni Gardiner who took the
name Princess Muna.
