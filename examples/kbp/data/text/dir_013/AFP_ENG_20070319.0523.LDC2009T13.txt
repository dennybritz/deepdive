An independent deputy in the Azerbaijani parliament has been
arrested and stripped of his immunity from criminal prosecution
after he was involved in a scuffle in the legislature, officials
said Monday.


The parliament voted 79-15, with five abstentions, in favour of
removing parliamentary immunity for Husseyn Abdullayev so he
could face criminal prosecution over the fracas, which broke out
on Friday during the government's annual presentation of its
economic results.


Abdullayev and pro-government deputy Fazail Agamaly exchanged
insults and blows after Abdullayev accused the government of
"deceiving parliament" in its report.


"This incident was a spit in the face of the political elite,"
said the parliamentary leader of the pro-government majority, Ali
Akhmadov.
