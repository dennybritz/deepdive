UN emergency relief coordinator John Holmes was to leave Tuesday
for a two-week tour of Sudan, Chad and the Central African
Republic (CAR), his first field mission since taking up the post
on March 1.


His office said Holmes would begin his mission in Khartoum, where
he was expected to meet with senior officials of the Sudanese
government and the United Nations, representatives of non-
governmental organizations, civil society and donor governments.


Holmes then plans to travel to Juba, in southern Sudan, for talks
with senior government officials and UN representatives.


On his return from Juba, Holmes is expected to travel to Sudan's
strife-torn Darfur region before heading to eastern Chad and then
N'Djamena, the Chadian capital.


He was then to visit the northern CAR as well as the CAR capital,
Bangui.


Holmes is to brief the UN Security Council on his mission when he
returns here.


Holmes is a British former ambassador to France who succeeded Jan
Egeland of Norway as UN undersecretary general for humanitarian
affairs.


The Darfur conflict, which erupted nearly four years ago, has
left at least 200,000 people dead and some 2.5 million displaced,
according to UN figures, Some sources say the death toll is much
higher.


The conflict has spilled over into neighboring Chad and CAR.
