The European Union decided to continue its temporary aid to the
new Palestinian government for three months, EU Commissioner for
External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner said here Monday.


"It is very important that at this delicate moment we at least
can go on with our international temporary mechanism in order to
see that the Palestinian people will not suffer in this period
when we have of course to make a judgment on the new unity
government," said Ferrero-Waldner.


The EU ceased direct aid to the Palestinian government when Hamas
came to power following last year's election and subsequently set
up a temporary mechanism for sending aid to the Palestinians.


Ferrero-Waldner was speaking after talks with US Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and
German Foreign Minister Frank- Walter Steinmeier on how to
respond to the newly formed Palestinian government.


The new government was officially formed over the weekend
grouping the Western- backed Fatah part of president Mahmud Abbas
and the radical Islamic movement Hamas, which Israel, the US and
EU consider a terrorist group.


Washington has criticized Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya for
reaffirming his government's support for "resistance" against
Israel and wants to maintain an aid embargo until the Palestinian
government formally recognizes Israel and renounces violence.
