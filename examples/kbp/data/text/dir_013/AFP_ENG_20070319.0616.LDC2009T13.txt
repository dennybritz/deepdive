Eric Medlen, a 33-year-old racer in the National Hot Rod
Association (NHRA) series, was hospitalized in critical condition
here Monday after an accident during Funny Car testing.


Medlen was injured when his hybrid car crashed into the right-
side guardwall on the drag strip at Gainesville Raceway and taken
by helicopter to the intensive care unit at nearby University of
Florida medical center.


The six-time winner on the NHRA tour took part in Sunday's 38th
annual Gatornationals here.


"Eric's extended family would like to thank everyone for their
thoughts and prayers," said Kelly Antonelli, a spokeswoman for
John Force Racing.


"At the same time, we would ask that you respect the family's
privacy at this time and allow the medical staff to do its work."


Medlen was a former crewman for Funny Car champion Force who
began driving in 2004. He won three times in 2005 and twice more
last year in a car prepared by his father.
