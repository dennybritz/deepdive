Chinese share prices rose 0.24 percent in early trade Tuesday on
follow-through buying after sharp gains made in the previous
session, dealers said.


They said pharmaceutical stocks were in focus on rotational
interest but sentiment was subdued after investors shrugged off a
central bank interest hike to push prices on the key Shanghai
index 2.8 percent higher on Monday.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, rose 7.16 points
to 3,021.60.


The Shanghai A-share index was up 7.34 points or 0.23 percent at
3,175.60 while the Shenzhen A-share index rose 7.05 points or
0.86 percent at 825.85.
