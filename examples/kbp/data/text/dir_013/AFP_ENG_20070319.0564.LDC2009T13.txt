Dutch bank ABN Amro and British banking group Barclays on Monday
confirmed they were in "early and exploratory" talks over a
possible merger that would create the world's fifth largest bank.


ABN Amro shares soared 9.60 percent on Monday in Amsterdam after
press reports that Barclays wanted to make an offer to buy the
Dutch group.
