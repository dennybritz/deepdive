A barrage of mortar shells crashed down into the seaport in
southern Mogadishu on Monday, triggering heavy fighting between
insurgents and Somali government troops, AFP correspondents
witnessed.


The artillery duel came hours after Somali and Ugandan troops
secured the port in southern Mogadishu ahead of the arrival of
military hardware for African Union peacekeepers.


"Insurgents have fired several mortar shells and they have landed
near the seaport and surrounding areas and government forces have
responded heavily," said Mohamed Nur Hassan, a resident.


"The fighting is very heavy," he said.


AFP correspondents watching from on top of tall buildings said
the exploding shells were lighting up the Mogadishu skyline and
spreading panic among the residents.
