The World Wide Fund for Nature on Monday said it has lodged a
complaint with the European Court of Justice in a bid to force
the European Union to lower its North Sea cod catch.


The WWF said the EU agriculture and fishing ministry has failed
to go far enough in lowering the quota for fishing the severely
depleted species in the North Sea by setting it at 20,000 tonnes
for 2007.


That amounts to a 14-percent reduction from 2006.


But the WWF said the EU was thereby breaching its own policy on
cod fishing which obliges it to lower quotas by at least 15
percent when the number of female codfish drops below a certain
level.


"The EU is breaking its own environment regulations so we are
putting on the legal brakes," said Karoline Schacht, a
spokeswoman for WWF's German branch.


"In terms of figures, it is only a few percentage points, but
what we are fighting for is the ecological and commercial
survival of one of our most important fish species."


Brussels originally wanted the number of days cod fishermen spend
at sea to be reduced by a quarter but after marathon talks in
December finally cut it by eight to 10 percent, depending on the
area.


WWF and other environmental groups like Greenpeace have called
for a complete ban on cod fishing, warning the species would
otherwise risk commercial extinction.
