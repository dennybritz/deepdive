Barcelona midfielder Deco has withdrawn from Portugal's squad for
their Euro 2008 qualifiers against Belgium and Serbia in order to
have surgery on his right hand.


The 29-year-old underwent surgery on Monday on the third finger
on his right hand after he twisted it during Barcelona's 4-0 win
over Recreativo Huelva in the Spanish League over the weekend.


Deco said he wanted to put off the surgery so as to play for
Portugal during the two matches but was advised against it by
Barcelona's medical department.


"I spoke to (Portugal coach Luiz Felipe) Scolari and told him I
would really like to be with the team during these matches," he
told reporters before entering the hospital in Barcelona where
the surgery was held.


"But I also talked to Barcelona's doctor and he felt we coudn't
wait. We made the decision to go ahead with the operation now,"
the Lusa news agency quoted him as saying.


Deco is expected be out for 10 to 15 days after the surgery. The
Portuguese international had an operation on the same finger one
year ago after he fell heavily on it.


Portugal face Belgium in Lisbon on Saturday and Serbia in
Belgrade four days later. The squad lies in fourth place in Group
A after Finland, Serbia and Poland.
