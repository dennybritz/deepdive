Iraq will execute Saddam Hussein's aide and former vice president
Taha Yassin Ramadan early on Tuesday for crimes against humanity,
a lawyer from the executed dictator's defence team told AFP on
Monday.


"The Americans called Ramadan's lawyer and asked him to be ready
as Ramadan was to be hanged tomorrow at 2:30 am (2330 GMT
Monday)," lawyer Badie Aref said, adding that he was told about
the planned execution by Ramadan's lawyer whom he refused to
identify.
