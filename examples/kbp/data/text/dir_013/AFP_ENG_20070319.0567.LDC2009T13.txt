Dutch bank ABN Amro and British banking group Barclays on Monday
confirmed they were in "early and exploratory" talks over a
possible merger that would create the world's fifth largest bank.


Barclays said the talks were concerning "a potential combination
of the two organisations which will create value for both sets of
shareholders."


ABN Amro shares soared 9.60 percent on Monday after press reports
that Barclays wanted to make an offer to buy the Dutch group.


A takeover by Barclays of ABN Amro would create a group with a
market capitalisation of more than 160 billion dollars (120
billion euros), making it the world's fifth-biggest behind
Citigroup, Bank of America, both of the United States, China's
ICBC and British rival HSBC.


The combined enterprise would have 47 million clients and employ
220,000 people in 50 countries.
