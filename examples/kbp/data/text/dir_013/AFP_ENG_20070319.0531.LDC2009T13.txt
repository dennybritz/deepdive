Belgium on Monday praised Morocco's plans to grant the disputed
Western Sahara territory self-rule but keep it under Rabat's
sovereignty.


"We are delighted at the ambitious and brave Moroccan plan which
advances the issue," said Belgian Development Cooperation
Minister Armand De Decker following talks with Moroccan Foreign
Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri in Marrakech.


"When this project is presented at the United Nations ... we will
examine it in the most objective and favourable way possible."


Morocco is due to present its plan to the UN in April and King
Mohammed VI recently sent envoys to several countries to explain
the proposal.


However, the plan has already been rejected by Algerian-backed
separatist group the Polisario Front, which has been fighting for
full independence for the Saharan or Saharawi people since 1973.


Rabat was at war with the Polisario Front over Western Sahara, a
former Spanish colony which it annexed in 1975, until a UN-
brokered ceasefire in 1991.


Since then, the United Nations has tried several times to
organise a referendum on self-determination in the desolate but
phosphate-rich region.
