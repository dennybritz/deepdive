The leader of Britain's main opposition party extended his
opinion poll lead over finance minister Gordon Brown, his likely
rival at the next general election, to 15 percentage points in a
survey published on The Guardian's website on Monday.


When asked who they would prefer as prime minister, 43 percent of
respondents chose David Cameron, who has headed the opposition
Conservatives since December 2005, while 28 percent backed
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, Tony Blair's likely
successor as ruling Labour party leader.


The 15-point gap is two points wider than in a similar poll last
month.


The poll also showed that the Conservatives extended their lead
on Labour in the general poll, with 41 percent of voters backing
the Tories, a one point increase compared to last month.


Labour was unchanged at 31 percent, while the Liberal Democrats,
Britain's third-biggest political party, fell one point to 18
percent.


Brown could take some solace in the poll, which showed that 56
percent of those questioned said the last decade had been
prosperous for Britain, and 61 percent responded that it had been
better for them and their families.


The survey comes less than two months ahead of elections for
local councils, and the Scottish and Welsh assemblies, in May.


Many commentators believe Blair will resign in the wake of those
elections -- he has pledged to step down by September.


Pollster ICM questioned 1,011 adults between March 16 and March
18.
