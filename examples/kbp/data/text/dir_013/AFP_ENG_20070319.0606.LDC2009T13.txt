One of the Florida judges involved in the legal wrangling that
followed the death of flamboyant former Playboy model Anna Nicole
Smith was found smoking marijuana, police said on Monday.


Judge Lawrence Korda was given a citation to appear in court
after he was found smoking a marijuana cigarette in a park in
Hollywood, Florida -- near the hotel where Smith died on February
8 -- according to the police report.


Following Smith's death, Korda had held an emergency hearing to
determine whether to take DNA to help determine who fathered the
celebrity's now six- month-old daughter.


Another judge, Larry Seidlin, grew teary-eyed when he said in
late February he wanted Smith to be buried in the Bahamas.


DNA samples were taken to determine paternity, but Smith's body
remained in the morgue until March 2, amid a separate legal
battle over custody of the legal remains.


The TV celebrity was finally laid to rest in the Bahamas on March
2 at a private ceremony attended by her estranged mother, as well
as her longtime companion Howard K. Stern and former boyfriend
Larry Birkhead.


But her burial did not put an end to the controversy and legal
battles that had marked much of her buxom blonde model's life.


Authorities in Florida were expected to announce later this week
what caused Smith to pass out and die.


Courts in California and the Bahamas are yet to determine who
fathered Smith's baby. Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband Frederic von
Arnhem is also among the contenders.


The little girl could eventually inherit a fortune depending on
the outcome of a case Smith filed over the estate of the 89-year-
old wheelchair-bound oil magnate she had married when she was 26.


Smith was 39 when she died.
