Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is using "hit squads" to crack
down on opposition politicians and activists, Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai said in an
interview published Tuesday.


Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Tsvangirai said: "Instead of
random beatings at police stations, (Mugabe) is now using hit
squads, unidentified men, unidentified vehicles."


"But we know these are units of state agents that have been given
this assignment."


Tsvangirai and dozens of other activists were severely beaten as
they tried to stage an anti-government rally on March 11.


The opposition leader laid the blame squarely at Mugabe's door,
telling the Telegraph: "I can assess who is in charge of this --
it is coming directly from Mugabe."


"Mugabe is a violent man and he doesn't hide it, especially where
his power is threatened ... No excuses, no regrets, the defiance
epitomises his attitude."


The country's Security Minister Didymus Mutasa, however, denied
Tsvangirai's allegations, saying bluntly: "It is a flat lie."


"He and his group are the people who started the whole process in
defiance of the government's order not to hold a rally at a
specific place," Mutasa was quoted by the Telegraph as saying.


Opposition to 83-year-old Mugabe, in power since independence in
1980, has been steadily mounting amid an economic meltdown with
inflation standing at 1,730 percent and four out of five people
out of work.


Mugabe however has remained defiant in the face of virulent
criticism, blaming the unrest on the MDC and its critics.
