A Moroccan implicated in the 2003 Casablanca suicide bombings
that killed 45 people will appear in court on Tuesday, a judicial
source said.


Saad Houssaini was sentenced to 20 years in absentia for
involvement in the attacks in the port city, but his exact role
was never specified.


Knicknamed the "chemist" by the Moroccan press for his alleged
bomb-making skills, Houssaini was on the run until being arrested
earlier this month.


Under Moroccan law he must appear in court after 12 days in
custody, and on Tuesday he will appear before the anti-terrorism
tribunal at Sale, near Rabat.


The authorities believe Houssaini is a leading member of the
Moroccan Islamic Combat Group (GICM), which has links to Al-Qaeda
and is suspected of involvement in the Madrid train bombings in
2004.


The May 2003 bombings, the biggest in Morocco's history, killed
45 people including 12 suicide bombers, and left dozens injured.


Days after Houssaini's arrest, there was a suicide bombing in a
cybercafe in Casablanca, injuring four people including the
bomber's suspected accomplice.
