Hong Kong share prices opened 0.85 percent higher Tuesday,
tracking overnight gains on Wall Street and on expectations of
strong results from major companies due later in the week,
dealers said.


However, they said overall trading could be restrained Tuesday
ahead of a decision by the US Federal Reserve on interest rates.
The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee was due to
begin a two-day meeting on Tuesday.


The Hang Seng Index opened up 163.96 points at 19,430.70.
