Zimbabwe in the face of mounting criticism for its treatment of
the opposition should take part in a planned EU-Africa summit
later this year in Portugal, the Portuguese foreign minister said
Monday.


"Zimbabwe should be invited. We have always said the country
should take part in the summit," Luis Amado told a joint news
conference with his visiting Angolan counterpart Joao Bernardo de
Miranda.


The second summit between Europe and Africa -- the first was held
in April 2000 in Cairo -- is set to take place in December during
Portugal's term at the helm of the six-month rotating presidency
of the European Union.


It was originally supposed to take place in April 2003 but was
indefinitely delayed due to opposition from some European nations
over the presence of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe who is
accused of violating human rights.


Mugabe is banned from traveling to Europe under sanctions imposed
by the EU on Zimbabwe since 2002 but the African Union has
insisted that all its member states should be allowed to take
part in the summit.


He has come under renewed international condemnation after
Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was arrested and
beaten by security forces earlier this month.
