United Nations police in Kosovo said Friday they had arrested an
ethnic Albanian suspected of gunning down two witnesses in a war
crimes trial in the province.


Osman Zyberaj was detained at his home in the southern town of
Prizen on Thursday "on suspicion of the murder" of one of the
witnesses in October 2005, the police said in a statement.


The two victims, brothers Nazim and Hasan Rrustemi, were
witnesses in the trial of Selim Krasniqi, a former commander of
the ethnic Albanian guerillas that fought Serb forces during
Kosovo's 1998-1999 conflict.


"As a result of multiple gunshot wounds, Hasan died at the scene
from his injuries and Nazim required medical treatment to gunshot
wounds to his legs," said the police statement.


Zyberaj was identified as being a suspect in the shooting during
a subsequent probe conducted by a police unit that specialises in
war crimes investigations, it added.


Krasniqi was sentenced to seven years' in jail by a UN court in
Kosovo last year after being found guilty of committing war
crimes against fellow ethnic Albanians.


Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since June 1999, after
a 78-day NATO bombing campaign forced the Serbian-dominated
Yugoslav security forces to withdraw from the province, ending a
brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
