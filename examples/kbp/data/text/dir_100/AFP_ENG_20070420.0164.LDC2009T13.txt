EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana will hold new talks on
April 25 with Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani at as an
undetermined location, Solana's spokeswoman confirmed Friday.


"There will indeed be a meeting on April 25," she told AFP.


The UN Security Council imposed new sanctions against Iran on
March 24 after it repeatedly ignored ultimatums to suspend
uranium enrichment but charged Solana with trying to re-establish
talks.
