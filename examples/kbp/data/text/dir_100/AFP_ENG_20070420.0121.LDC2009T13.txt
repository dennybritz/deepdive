Sri Lanka's air force said Friday it had lost an unmanned spy
plane flying over the country's embattled northeast close to
Tamil Tiger territory.


The Israeli-built Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was lost
somewhere over the northern edge of Trincomalee district, close
to the Tamil rebel stronghold of Mullaitivu, Group Captain
Ajantha Silva said.


"There was a malfunction and the (ground-based) pilots landed it
somewhere between Pulmoddai and Kokkilai," Silva said. "We are
sending helicopters to the area to look for it."


The Sri Lankan air force has lost at least three Israeli-built
Drones, or spy planes, since 1997.


The latest loss came as the air force stepped up air attacks
against suspected Tamil Tiger positions in the northeast of the
island.
