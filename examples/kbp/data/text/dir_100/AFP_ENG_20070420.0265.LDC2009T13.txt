The US embassy in Germany said on Friday it was increasing
security at its facilities in the country in response to a
heightened threat situation.


"US diplomatic and consular facilities in Germany are increasing
their security posture," the statement said.


"We are taking these steps in response to a heightened threat
situation.  The US embassy encourages Americans in Germany to
increase their vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster
their own personal security."


A spokesman for the embassy said the increased threat came
against the backdrop of warnings from the German federal police
last month that Germany faced a higher risk of terrorist attack
following ultimatums from Islamic extremists for it to withdraw
its troops from Afghanistan.
