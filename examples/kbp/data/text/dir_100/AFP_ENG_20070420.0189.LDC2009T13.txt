Spanish champions and current league leaders Barcelona are set to
sign Lyon defender Eric Abidal, according to Spanish sports daily
Marca.


Marca said negotiations between the French club and Barcelona
have been "going on for some time, and are at a very advanced
stage", and that Abidal could join the Spanish giants for 12
million euros.


France international Abidal took a virtual step towards the exit
door of the reigning French champions when he recently said he
would be happy to join another Spanish side, Valencia.


The 27-year-old still has two years left on his contract with
Lyon, who this weekend could be officially handed their sixth
consecutive league crown, having arrived at the club in 2004 from
Lille.


If he moves to the Catalan club he would be joining two other
French international players, defender Lilian Thuram and
midfielder Ludovic Giuly.
