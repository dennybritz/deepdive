Indian share prices rose 2.03 percent on Friday on improved fund
buying after two of the country's top software exporters reported
robust fourth quarter earnings, dealers said.


They said the markets could gain further next week despite
concerns of a tightening in monetary policy by India's central
bank next Tuesday.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex closed up
277.71 points at 13,897.41.


Wipro and Satyam Computer, India's third and fourth-largest
software exporters, reported higher fourth-quarter earnings to
round off a volatile year marked by the rupee's surge, rising
interest rates and galloping wages.


Bangalore-based Wipro's net profit rose 39 percent from a year
earlier to 8.56 billion rupees (203.8 million dollars) in the
three months to March 31.


Satyam, based in the neighbouring southern Indian city of
Hyderabad, said net income climbed 16.7 percent from a year
earlier to 3.94 billion rupees (93.79 million dollars) in the
quarter.


"The markets are set to gain decisively next week as crucial
technical levels have been crossed. We expect profit booking at
higher levels," said Hiten Mehta, fund manager with Fortune
Financial Services.


Gainers led losers 1,508 to 1,072 on volume of 45.71 billion
rupees (1.08 billion rupees).


The rupee gained against the dollar at 41.99 from 41.25 and was
unchanged against the euro at 57.2.


Wipro closed down 8.1 rupees or 1.4 percent to 570.8 while Satyam
Computer rose 28.35 rupees or 6.33 percent to 476.2.
