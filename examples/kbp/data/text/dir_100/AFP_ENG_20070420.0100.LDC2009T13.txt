The head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jean-
Claude Juncker, said Friday he saw no reason to be "excessively"
worried about the euro's strength as the currency flirted with a
record high against the dollar.


"I don't see any particular reason to be excessively concerned,"
said Juncker as he headed into a meeting with finance chiefs from
the 13-nation eurozone.


Eurozone ministers were gathered Friday in Berlin for informal
talks as the euro hit the highest point since December 2004 and
nearing its all-time record against the US currency of 1.3666
dollars.


"The euro has not appreciated brutally but slowly," said Juncker,
who is also Luxembourg's prime and finance minister. "We will
have to discuss exchange rates as we do each time."


The prospect of higher interest rates in the eurozone has helped
drive the euro higher against other major currencies as many
investors borrow in low interest rate currencies for higher-
yielding euro-denominated investments.


However, Juncker sounded a note of caution for the second time
this week about such so-called carry trades, warning: "The market
should know that they are ill- advised when they take up one-way
bets."
