Veteran Scotland defender David Weir was rewarded for his role in
Rangers' revival under Walter Smith by being handed a one-year
deal that will ensure he is still at Ibrox next season.


Weir, 36, joined on loan from Everton in January following
Smith's return to the club in the wake of Paul Le Guen's
departure.


There had been speculation that he might retire at the end of the
season but his performances have been sufficiently impressive for
Rangers to offer him the chance of another season.
