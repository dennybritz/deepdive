Russian security agents questioned opposition leader and former
chess champion Garry Kasparov on Friday, he said, after leading
last weekend's opposition rallies.


Kasparov was questioned at the offices of the FSB security
service, successor to the Soviet-era KGB, on suspicion of
extremism, he told journalists afterwards.


"It was a very correct, very calm conversation," Kasparov said,
after being questioned about statements he made in a radio
interview and a publication by his United Civil Front political
movement this month.


"It seemed to me the questioner knew perfectly well that this
wasn't at all a matter of extremism," he said.


Kasparov is one of the leaders of The Other Russia, an umbrella
opposition group whose demonstrations against President Vladimir
Putin in Moscow and Saint Petersburg last weekend were vastly
outnumbered and violently dispersed by riot police.


"It will be very difficult for the prosecutor to do anything so
stupid as pursue a criminal case related to extremism," Kasparov
said, adding that at marches by The Other Russia, "there was no
single act of violence, there was not even a broken window."


He said that the FSB regularly interrogated activists from his
movement throughout Russia.


"We are now just seeing in the capital what has already become a
daily practice across the whole country."


The Other Russia has vowed to continue its anti-Kremlin struggle
ahead of parliamentary elections in December and a presidential
election next March when Putin is due to stand down.
