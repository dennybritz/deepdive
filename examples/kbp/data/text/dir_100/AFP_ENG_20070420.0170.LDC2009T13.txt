The European Union has transfered 66 million euros (90 million
dollars) to the United Nations aid agency for Palestinian
refugees, the EU said on Friday.


The money is part of a total of 264 million euros which the EU
decided to allocate to the UN Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) over the period between 2007 and
2010.


The deal was signed on Thursday by John Kjaer, head of the
European Commission Technical Assistance Office for the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and UNRWA officials at a ceremony in the
Qalandiya refugee camp outside Jerusalem.


The funds will pay salaries for UNRWA's teachers, doctors and
social workers, and enable the ongoing support of hundreds of
thousands of refugees, the agency said.


The EU has become one of the largest donors to UNRWA, which
supports some 4.4 million refugees in the Palestinian
territories, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.


The question of Palestinian refugees is one of the thorniest
issues in the Israeli-Arab conflict, as Israel vehemently rejects
Palestinian demands to allow their return to lands abandoned
during the 1948 war when the Jewish state was founded.
