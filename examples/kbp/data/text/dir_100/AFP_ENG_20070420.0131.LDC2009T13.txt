Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said Friday he will
announce a cabinet shuffle within weeks, amid mounting pressure
for change.


"If God willing I will publicly announce a limited cabinet
reshuffle at the beginning of next month or in two weeks," he
told ElShinta radio after Friday prayers.


Yudhoyono said he was confident the move would improve government
performance.


Politicians and analysts have been publicly calling for cabinet
changes in recent weeks, following a string of transport
disasters and corruption claims.


Golkar, the majority party in parliament chaired by Vice
President Jusuf Kalla, has been leading the calls for a purge.


Friday marks midway through Yudhoyono's five-year term.


Yudhoyono came to power as Indonesia's first directly elected
president in 2004 and his term ends in 2009.


He made a minor reshuffle in December 2005, dismissing three
ministers, shifting three others, including his top economy
minister, and bringing in three new faces.
