US troops backed by helicopters clashed with militants near a
Shiite mosque in Baghdad during the main weekly Muslim prayers
Friday, before seizing bomb-making equipment, the military said.


The fighting broke out when soldiers came under small-arms fire
from the Hussainiyah al-Bayaa mosque, which is managed by the
movement of radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, in southwest
Baghdad, a US statement said.


"Two insurgents were killed in the firefight," the military
added.


"Additional soldiers arrived to assist, cordoning off access and
roads. Aviation support also arrived at the scene of the
fighting, but did not engage any targets."


A spokesman at Sadr's office, Hamdullah Rikabi, complained that
"this morning US forces sealed off the Ali al-Bayaa mosque
disrupting the prayers of the worshippers, who are followers of
Sadr."


The US military said it seized explosives after the clash.


"After two insurgents were killed in the incident, soldiers
searched nearby buildings and found chemicals in a house believed
to be bomb-making materials," it said, adding that one person was
detained.


Later, Iraqi soldiers entered the mosque but no weapons were
found inside the complex, the military said. No US casualties
were reported.


Fighters from Sadr's Mahdi Army, a Shiite militia accused of
involvement in Iraq's vicious sectarian conflict, often clash
with US forces battling to quell the fighting and support a
fragile coalition government.
