Two NATO soldiers were killed Friday in separate blasts in
insurgency-hit southern Afghanistan, the International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) said.


The force, which has around 37,000 troops in Afghanistan fighting
the resurgent Taliban movement, gave no further details about the
victims.


"Earlier today, two ISAF soldiers died as the result of
explosions in two separate incidents in southern Afghanistan," an
ISAF statement said.


ISAF said it would not release the victims' nationalities before
the relevant national authorities.


However the Netherlands said earlier Friday that a 21-year-old
Dutch corporal became the first Dutch soldier to be killed in
action in Afghanistan on Friday when he stepped on a landmine
during a foot patrol.


Dutch chief of defence staff General Dick Berlijn confirmed the
soldier was part of NATO's Operation Achilles against the Taliban
in southwestern Helmand province, according to the ANP news
agency.


The deaths brought to 42 the number of international troops
killed in Afghanistan this year. Some 170 were killed there in
2006.
