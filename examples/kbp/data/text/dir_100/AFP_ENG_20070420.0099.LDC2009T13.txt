A 76-year-old Jewish professor who protected some 20 students in
Monday's US school shooting was buried in Israel on Friday.


Dozens of people gathered at the Ra'anana cemetery in the centre
of the country to pay their last respects to Liviu Librescu, a
Romanian Holocaust survivor who migrated to Israel in 1978 before
moving to the United States.


Family members, friends and rabbis eulogised Lubrescu before his
body was lowered into the grave.


"My years are now open to your legacy... to do the best I can to
live," his son, Joe Librescu, said before ending with "goodbye,
father."


In the aftermath of Monday's shooting, Librescu was hailed as a
hero for holding the gunman at bay by blocking a classroom door
while students escaped through a window.


Librescu became a senior researcher and mathematics lecturer at
Virginia Tech University where he taught for 20 years.


Thirty-two teachers and students were left dead after Cho Seung-
Hui, 23, a Virginia Tech senior, went on the rampage with two
recently bought handguns.


It later emerged he had been identified as mentally ill.
