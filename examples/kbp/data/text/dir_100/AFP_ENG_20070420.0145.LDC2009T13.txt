Australia and China will push for progress in free-trade talks
ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to Sydney in
September, Australia's trade minister said here on Friday.


"Minister Bo and I reaffirmed our commitment to achieving
progress in the negotiations, including in advance of the visit
to Australia by President Hu Jintao in September," Australian
Trade Minister Warren Truss told reporters.


Truss met with Bo Xilai, the Chinese Minister of Commerce, on
Thursday night shortly after arriving for a three-day visit.


Truss said a "wide range" of Australian service businesses are
interested in the liberalisation of the service industry in
China.


China's state media last month reported the country's Cabinet
would take steps to further open its long-restricted services
sector to bring it more in line with World Trade Organisation
expectations.


He also addressed Chinese concerns about opening its agricultural
industry.


"Our overall agricultural production is very much smaller than is
achieved in China," he said. "So Australia's 140,000 farmers are
no threat to the 800 million farmers of China."


Last year, bilateral trade volume reached 32.8 billion dollars,
up 20.6 percent from the previous year. In the first three months
of 2007, trade amounted to 6.27 billion dollars, according to
official Chinese statistics.
