Los Angeles Galaxy have already earned millions of dollars from
the signing of David Beckham, who has yet to kick a ball in anger
for the Major League Soccer club.


Real Madrid midfielder Beckham will join the Galaxy in July after
his contract with the Spanish giants ends at the end of the
season.


The lure of Beckham has allowed Galaxy to sell an additional
7,000 season tickets, which translates into around five million
dollars.


They have also increased the price of premium seats by 48 percent
and are expecting revenue to double this coming season to around
10 million dollars.


To add to the coffers Herbalife Ltd, who sell nutritional and
weight-loss products, have signed a five-year 20 million dollars
agreement to have their names on club shirts. That equates to
another four million dollars a year.


In all, Beckham's arrival should bring in an additional 14
million dollars in his first season - around nine million more
than his annual playing contract with the club.


Tim Leiweke, chief executive officer of the Anschutz
Entertainment Group, the Los Angeles-based company that owns
Galaxy, said: "We were never worried about our financial
commitment. We've already made our money back."
