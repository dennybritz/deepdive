Police in the northern Philippines said Friday a man who lived
close to where US Peace Corps volunteer Julia Campbell died is a
suspect in the killing.


The body of the 40-year-old woman was found partially buried on
Wednesday, raising fears of foul play.


Officers are looking for a resident of the northern mountain town
of Batad where Campbell went missing on April 8, said
Superintendent Joseph Adnol.


A 10-year-old witness saw the suspect loitering at the site where
the victim was last seen.


"We are also gathering some circumstantial evidences to support
the testimony of the lone witness," Adnol said.


Although the suspect has vanished from his home, "police here...
already have an idea of where we can find him but we're
withholding that information," he added.


The police are investigating reports that the suspect was seen
carrying Campbell's knapsack after she went missing.


President Gloria Arroyo's spokesman, Ignacio Bunye, said "the
president is saddened by the death of Miss Campbell."


"It is unfortunate that a committed and selfless person, who
has... obviously grown to love our country, met a tragic end
here," Bunye said, citing Campbell's work for the poor in areas
east of the capital.


A former journalist, Campbell was on holiday and had come to the
Batad area to see its world famous rice terraces. She had been
working as a teacher at a college in eastern Legaspi city.


Her body has been taken to Manila and is being kept in a
refrigerated facility while awaiting the arrival of a US
forensics expert who will help local investigators in the
autopsy.
