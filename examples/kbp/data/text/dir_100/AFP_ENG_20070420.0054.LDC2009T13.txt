A rocket attack on a US military base killed one marine and
wounded two others, the military reported Friday.


The projectile struck a forward operating base in the town of
Mahmudiyah, south of Baghdad, on Thursday night.


The latest death took the military's losses in Iraq to 54 for
this month alone and to 3,314 since the March 2003 invasion,
according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
