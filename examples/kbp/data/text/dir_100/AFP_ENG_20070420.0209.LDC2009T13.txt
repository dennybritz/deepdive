More than 16 million children and adults have been vaccinated
against measles in North Korea in the last two months, marking
one of the fastest responses to a major outbreak of the disease,
international relief agencies said on Friday.


The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health
Organisation and the International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies funded and organised the campaign after a
request from the North Korean authorities in February.


"This was a remarkable example of good cooperation between
different organisations," said Jaap Timmer, head of the Red Cross
delegation in the authoritarian and secretive communist state.


"The local Red Cross volunteers, who have been trained in first
aid and community health, reinforced the vaccination teams to
enable them to finish the two phases in such a short period of
time," he added.


Measles made its first appearance in a decade in North Korea last
November, leading to four deaths and 3,600 infections.
