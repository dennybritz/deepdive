Chrysler employees are considering a bid for the loss-making US
arm of German-US auto giant DaimlerChrysler to prevent Chrysler
from falling into the hands of a private equity firm, the Wall
Street Journal Europe reported on Friday.


The United Auto Workers (UAW) union was reviewing a proposal for
employees and the union to buy 70 percent of Chrysler via an
employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), the report said.


Daimler would hold on to the remaining stake, the newspaper said,
quoting a source familiar with the matter.


The plan was originally floated by a small group of workers at
Chrysler's plant in Toledo, Ohio, and the UAW's legal department
is studying the viability of the idea, it said.


The purchase would be financed by workers agreeing to cuts in
healthcare benefits and other concessions, the newspaper said.


The UAW and German labour leaders have said they would fight a
sale of Chrysler to a private equity buyer, fearing a new owner
looking for a quick financial return would slash jobs, wages and
benefits, the report continued.


Investment funds Cerberus and Blackstone are negotiating to buy
Chrysler, as is Canadian car parts supplier Magna in conjunction
with Onex. US billionaire Kirk Kerkorian has also expressed an
interest.
