European Ryder Cup star David Howell will be the star attraction
at the Macau Open next month alongside Chinese legend Zhang Lian-
wei.


Howell, ranked 24th in the world, is part of a growing band of
European players who relish playing in Asia and he jumped at the
chance of visiting the former Portuguese colony.


"I've heard a lot of good things about the golf course and its
unique practice range (where golfers hit balls into the sea) and
I'm sure it will be a great tournament," said the Englishman.


"When the opportunity to play in Macau came my way, I decided to
take it up and experience the tournament for myself.


"I don't know what to expect but it sounds like one of those
places on the planet that is worth visiting."


Howell has won four times in Europe but has struggled for form
this season.


He will tee off alongside the Asian Tour's top stars at the Macau
Golf and Country Club from May 17-20, including Zhang who won the
title in 2001 and 2002.
