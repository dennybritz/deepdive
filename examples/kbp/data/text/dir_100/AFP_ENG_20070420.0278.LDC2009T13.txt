Armed men attacked an oil rig security vessel at a facility of a
multinational oil company in Nigeria's southern oil-rich state of
Bayelsa, officials said Friday.


Unconfirmed industry sources said six people were thought to have
been wounded in the attack late Thursday while three could have
been kidnapped.


"There was indeed an incident last night. We suspect it was a
piracy activity but the details are still sketchy, and we have
sent officials of the state to go for investigation", Bayelsa
state government secretary Godknows Igali told AFP in Yenagoa
Friday.


The attack targeted Mike One, a security vessel supporting
Trident 8, a transocean rig drilling for Conoil at Brass, in the
Gulf of Guinea.


Military and naval spokesmen could not give further details.


Violence is rife in the states of the Niger Delta, with frequent
attacks on foreign oil companies and kidnapping of expatriate
employees by separatists seeking a greater share of the region's
oil wealth.
