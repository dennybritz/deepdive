ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said on Friday that the yen
should reflect the country's growing economic strength as the
Japanese currency hovered close to its all-time low against the
euro


"We believe the Japanese economy is on a sustainable recovery
path and that the exchange rate should reflect these economic
fundamentals," he told journalists after a meeting with finance
ministers from the 13-nation eurozone.
