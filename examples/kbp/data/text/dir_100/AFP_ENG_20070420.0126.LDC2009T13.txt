New Pakistan cricket captain Shoaib Malik said Friday that he
wants to be an aggressive leader like his hero Wasim Akram.


All-rounder Malik, who was named on Thursday to succeed Inzamam-
ul-Haq, also said his first priority was to boost the team's
confidence after their dismal World Cup exit.


"As a captain I consider myself to be in the mould of Wasim
Akram. He is my ideal captain," Malik told AFP.


"I am going to have an aggressive approach. I don't like a
defensive approach."


Fast bowling great Wasim, who led Pakistan to the runners-up spot
in the 1999 World Cup, was known for his aggressive style. He
retired in 2003 with 414 Test wickets and 502 in one-day
interationals.


In contrast Inzamam was sometimes criticised for being defensive.


Inzamam resigned after Pakistan lost to minnows Ireland in the
Caribbean on March 17. The defeat knocked them out of the World
Cup.


Malik said that his favourite current captain in world cricket
was New Zealand's Stephen Fleming "because he is also very
aggressive."


The Pakistan Cricket Board said it had chosen the 25-year-old
Malik, who has played 18 Tests and 137 one-day internationals,
over more established names to give the team a fresh start.


"I know that team morale is not very high, self-confidence is low
and my job will be to get back the high positions for the team.
It is still a very good team," Malik said.


"I believe in playing to win. One thing that can bring the
confidence back is winning."
