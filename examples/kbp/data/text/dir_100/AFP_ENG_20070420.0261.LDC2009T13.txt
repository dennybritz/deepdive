Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt will meet US President
George W. Bush in Washington on May 15 for talks on alternative
energy sources, the Swedish government said on Friday.


"It's a very important visit for Sweden because it will enable us
to present our work on energy issues," Reinfeldt's spokesman
Oscar Haallen told AFP.


Reinfeldt, who heads a centre-right government in power since
October 2006, is also scheduled to meet UN Secretary General Ban
Ki-moon for talks on the same subject.


Two cooperation agreements are expected to be signed between
Sweden and the United States, US ambassador to Sweden Michael
Wood told Swedish news agency TT.


The first concerns a collaboration between universities,
researchers and businesses on alternative energy sources. The
second covers biofuels research.


According to Wood, five energy collaboration projects could
receive US funding. One of those is the company Swedish Biofuels,
whose ethanol for airplanes has caught the interest of the US
Department of Defence.


Sweden, a world leader in environmental issues, is heavily
involved in the development of renewable energies, in particular
biofuels.
