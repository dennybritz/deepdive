Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko was to meet Friday with his
arch-rival Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in an attempt to
resolve the constitutional feud paralyzing government in this ex-
Soviet state.


Organized at the request of the prime minister, "the hour-long
meeting will begin at 11:00 a.m. local time" (0800 GMT), the
presidential administration said in a statement.


The country has been locked in a power struggle since the pro-
Western Yushchenko ordered the dissolution of parliament on April
2 and called for early elections.


Yanukovych has opposed the dissolution and both sides have
organized demonstrations reminiscent of the 2004 uprising known
as the Orange Revolution.
