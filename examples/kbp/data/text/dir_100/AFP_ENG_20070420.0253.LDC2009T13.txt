Pakistan bowling legend and former captain Wasim Akram is to help
train fast bowlers for the national team, the Pakistan Cricket
Board said Friday.


Wasim, Pakistan's leading wicket-taker who retired in 2003, will
supervise a special two-week camp in the eastern city of Lahore
from mid-May, board spokesman Ahsan Malik told AFP.


Wasim's decision comes after new Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik
said he wanted to emulate him and it will boost Pakistan's
efforts to recover after their dismal World Cup.


PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf contacted Wasim in Singapore where he
is currently working with sports channel ESPN as a commentator,
Ahsan Malik said.


"The chairman contacted Wasim today and invited him over to help
Pakistan cricket and we are very happy that he has volunteered to
help," he said.


"Wasim has offered all-out support to the Pakistan team to
supervise the camp for young and upcoming fast bowlers.


"He will also supervise a training camp in June for the national
team in  (the northwestern city of) Abbotabad," the spokesman
said.


Wasim retired from international cricket with a world record 502
one-day and 414 Test wickets. He led Pakistan to the runners-up
spot in the 1999 World Cup.


He was criticised in Pakistan when in 2004 he went over to arch-
rival India and was reported to be helping out Indian fast
bowlers.
