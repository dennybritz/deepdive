Japan on Friday created the post of minister for the seas, hoping
to coordinate a firmer response amid protracted maritime disputes
with China and South Korea.


The minister would spearhead the tough negotiations with China on
how to divide lucrative gas reserves in the East China Sea.


The creation of the post, part of a broader bill on Japan's
maritime interests, was approved by the upper house with support
by the ruling coalition and three of four major opposition
parties, a parliamentary official said.


The lower house already approved the measure.


Japan's decision-making on sea policies is currently shared by
several ministries, which critics say causes delays in disputes
with neighbouring countries.


Shoichi Nakagawa, a top policy aide to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
earlier this month likened China to a "thief" and accused the
government of bungling in its response.


Japan and China are two of the world's largest energy importers.


During a landmark visit here last week, Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao called for Japan and China to reach a peaceful settlement,
although Beijing later clarified that it stood by its territorial
claims.


Chinese energy companies have started work in the East China Sea,
angering Japan which says Beijing could be taking its reserves.


Japan has also faced heated tension with South Korea over a set
of uninhabited islets called Takeshima in Japanese and Dokdo in
Korean.
