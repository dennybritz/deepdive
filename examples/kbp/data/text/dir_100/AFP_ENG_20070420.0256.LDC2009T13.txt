A 21-year-old corporal became the first Dutch soldier to be
killed in action in Afghanistan on Friday when he stepped on a
landmine during a foot patrol, the country's chief of defence
staff said.


General Dick Berlijn said the exact details of the death were not
yet known but confirmed the soldier was part of NATO's Operation
Achilles against the Taliban in the southwestern Helmand
province, according to the ANP news agency.


Previously, the Dutch death toll since the Netherlands'
deployment to Afghanistan in March 2006 was five -- four died in
accidents and one killed himself.


There are currently about 2,000 Dutch soldiers there, the
majority in the province of Oruzgan as part of NATO's
International Security Assistance Force, which was deployed at
the end of 2001.
