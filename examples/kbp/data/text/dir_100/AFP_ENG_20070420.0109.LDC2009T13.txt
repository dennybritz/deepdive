A "mentally disturbed" and little-known Bollywood starlet
attempted suicide over the wedding of film star Abhishek Bachchan
and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai, reports said Friday.


Janavi Kapoor, who is in her mid-20s and goes by the screen name
of Naina, turned up at a local police station Thursday night with
a slashed wrist. She also asked to register a complaint against
Bachchan, whom she says cheated on her.


Janavi starred in a song-and-dance sequence in Abhishek's movie
"Dus" in 2005, and claimed they had a year-long affair and that
he had promised to marry her.


"Abhishek had promised to disclose the nature of our
relationship," the girl was quoted as saying by Indian news
channels.


The police, however, did not register her complaint.


"She appeared to be in a disturbed state of mind and in
depression. We urged her to come back with her parents (on
Friday) to register her case," senior police inspector Pradeep
Shinde of Juhu police station told AFP.


Bollywood's hottest couple were preparing to tie the knot in a
traditional Hindu ceremony Friday evening, marking the end of
three days of private partying.


Crowds of fans have been straining for a glimpse of 33-year-old
Rai, a former Miss World and a popular actress, and Bachchan --
the 32-year-old son of screen legend Amitabh Bachchan.


The pair have starred together in at least five movies and are
seen as a dynamite box office duo.


Only 100 guests have been invited. Hundreds of police and
security guards have been employed to keep out gatecrashers.
