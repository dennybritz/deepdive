The presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan will visit Ankara on
April 29-3O for talks under Turkey's auspices aiming to cool
tensions between the two allies in the war against terror, the
Turkish presidency said Friday.


"The summit (between) Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and
the visiting presidents will provide an exchange of views on
Pakistan-Afghanistan ties and their repercussions on the region,"
a statement from Sezer's office said. "The aim of the meeting is
to serve regional stability and security."


Turkey offered to host the meeting between Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf and his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai with the
two countries at loggerheads in the fight against the Taliban.


Most Afghan officials, including Karzai, blame Pakistan for
failing to prevent Taliban-led militants from attacking
Afghanistan from their bases in Pakistan's tribal areas along
their common border. Some claim Pakistan supports the Taliban.


Islamabad has strongly denied the allegations, saying it has
80,000 troops stationed on the frontier and that pro-government
tribesmen recently killed 300 "foreign militants" in the region.


Pakistan was one of three countries that recognised the harsh
Taliban regime in the late 1990s, but later supported the US-led
invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 attacks on
the United States.


Nearly six years later, the Taliban are resurgent and rebel-
related violence has killed around 1,000 people in Afghanistan
this year, according to an AFP tally based on official reports.
