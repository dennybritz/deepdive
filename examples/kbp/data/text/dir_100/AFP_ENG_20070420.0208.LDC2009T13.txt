Unidentified gunmen shot dead a Tamil journalist in northern Sri
Lanka in the latest in a string of attacks against media
personnel, a rights group said Friday.


Subash Chandraboas, 32, editor of the Tamil monthly Nilam, was
gunned down late Monday at his residence in Vavuniya, 260
kilometres (162 miles) north of here, the Free Media Movement
(FMM) said.


Chandraboas also freelanced for other publications.


The FMM, which consists of journalists and rights activists, said
it was "appalled by this killing."


"Although the reason for killing him is not clear, the FMM fears
that this could be another attack on journalists and media
personnel working in north and east," where fighting is raging
between the government and Tamil Tiger rebels, the statement
said.


The report on the killing comes after an editor from a national
daily said she received a death threat from Sri Lanka's defence
secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse, a charge denied by him.


Media organisations have described Sri Lanka as the most
dangerous place on earth for journalists after Iraq, and rights
groups say that critics of government policy are treated as
traitors and enemies of the state.


Although there is no formal censorship imposed, Sri Lankan
authorities prevent journalists from travelling to areas held by
rebels, who are waging a separatist conflict that has killed more
than 60,000 people since 1972.
