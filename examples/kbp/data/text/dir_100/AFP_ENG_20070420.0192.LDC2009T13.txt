British Prime Minister Tony Blair will hold talks on Tuesday with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel about resolving the impasse over
the European Union constitution, her spokesman said on Friday.


"They will talk quite intensively about the latest developments
with regard to the EU constitution," deputy government spokesman
Thomas Steg told a press conference.


He welcomed comments by Blair published on Friday that Britain no
longer needs to hold a referendum on a new EU treaty to replace
an all-but-dead draft constitution.


The remark, made in an interview with a group of European
newspapers, will likely be read as a U-turn by eurosceptic
critics in the British government following a previous commitment
to holding a popular vote on the treaty.


"Tony Blair has made clear that his government, that Britain
takes a great interest in taking Europe forward. This statement
attests to a great will to make joint progress," Steg said.


"It is to be welcomed unreservedly. We hope that this statement
will also be useful to convince others who are still sceptical
and that we will achieve a positive outcome in June," he said.


Steg was referring to plans by Merkel to persuade her fellow EU
leaders to adopt a roadmap setting out the way forward on the
constitution at a summit in Brussels in June which Blair will
attend shortly before he is expected to leave office.


Germany holds the rotating presidency of the EU until the end of
June and Merkel has made it her aim not only to foster agreement
on a timetable for a new treaty to be adopted, but "also to make
progress on the content" of the text, Steg said.
