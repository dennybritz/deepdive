EU Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering called on Tripoli
Friday to free five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in a
high-profile AIDS trial in Libya.


"I call again on Libya to annul the death sentences and free the
Bulgarian nurses so they can return to their families in
Bulgaria," he said in a speech to the Bulgarian parliament
Friday.


The five nurses and a Palestinian doctor were arrested in Libya
in February 1999 and accused of having knowingly infected with
AIDS-tainted blood over 400 Libyan children at a hospital in the
northeastern town of Benghazi where they worked.


Poettering, who met earlier this week in Brussels with relatives
of the nurses, told a press conference in Sofia Wednesday that he
was "also worried about the fate of the children." But he added:
"it is not correct to transfer the blame" to the six medical
workers.


Libya's Supreme Court will hear a final appeal for the foreign
medics in May.
