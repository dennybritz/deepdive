Hong Kong share prices closed 1.31 percent higher Friday,
rebounding from Thursday's steep decline amid hopes that Chinese
authorities will take measured steps to cool down the country's
economy, dealers said.


They said investors also noted a recovery on Shanghai's A-share
market, which bounced back 3.92 percent after tumbling 4.5
percent Thursday amid worries over possible policy tightening.


China is widely expected to adopt further macro-economic
tightening measures after first-quarter gross domestic product
growth and March inflation came in stronger than expected.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 266.88 points at 20,566.59, off a
low of 20,474.31 and just off the day's high of 20,567.34. For
the week, the index was up 225.62 points or 1.1 percent.


Turnover was heavy at 63.0 billion dollars (8.1 billion US).
