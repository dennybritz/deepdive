Governments need to take the lead in pushing the building and
construction sector to adopt environmentally-friendly practices,
an industry expert told a UN-backed conference on climate change
Friday.


"I believe the role of government is critical and often lacking,"
said Rodney Milford, president of the International Council for
Research and Innovation in Building and Construction, which
promotes the exchange of information between researchers in the
building sector.


Speaking at the Business Summit for the Environment, which ended
Friday, Milford said there was a "need for regulation that will
encourage and even force and propel sustainable building and
construction."


Education must also be considered if the building and
construction sector is to adopt environmentally-friendly
practices, he said.


"We need to educate a whole range of people, whether they be the
public, whether they be the key stakeholders. We need to provide
information... it's important," Milford said.


Hundreds of the world's business executives and environment
experts met in Singapore to discuss the need for more global
corporations to join the fight against climate change.
