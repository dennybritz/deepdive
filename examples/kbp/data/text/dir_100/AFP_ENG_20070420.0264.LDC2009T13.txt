The 2008 Dakar Rally, which starts in Lisbon on January 5, will
bypass Mali, organisers said on Friday.


Organisers have prepared a course that focuses on sand racing for
the race's 30th anniversary.


"This will be a Dakar the colour of sand. The contestants will
encounter a lot of sand, 6,000km compared to 4,300km in 2007,"
said race director Etienne Lavigne at a presentation in Lisbon.


The first two stages will be held in Portugal before taking in
Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal. Mali has been excluded for
security reasons.


Two stages from this year's race, which were supposed to take
place in Mali, were cancelled following recommendations from the
country's Foreign Affairs Ministry.


"There is still a certain amount of instability in this region
and we feel it's very important to race in total security," added
Lavigne.


Mali's absence bodes well for Mauritania which will host a rest
day on January 13 at its capital Nouackchott.


"We should spend seven or eight days in Mauritania," said Lavigne
who predicted there will be around 500 contestants next year in
the car, motorcycle and truck categories.


The rally ends in the Senegalese capital of Dakar on January 20.
