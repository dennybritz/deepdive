Sony Ericsson, which makes mobile telephones, reported a leap in
first-quarter profits on Friday owing to a 63-percent surge in
the number of telephones sold.


The Japanese-Swedish company said that net profit in the quarter
had more than doubled on a 12-month comparison to 254 million
euros (345.5 million dollars) from 109 million euros.


The company said that it had made "a very positive start to the
year selling 63 percent more phones in the first quarter than a
year ago.


"The strong sales and solid financial performance demonstrate a
continuation of the momentum we established last year," the
president of Sony Ericsson, Miles Flint, said.


The company, created by Ericsson of Sweden which is the world
leader in making mobile telephone network systems and by
electronics group Sony, also said that it would make payments
totalling 848 million euros to its parent companies in 2007 in
the form of dividends, or of both a dividend and a capital
redemption.
