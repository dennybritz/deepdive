Beijing will use aircraft, missiles and cannon in what could
amount to a massive umbrella over the city to keep athletes dry
during next year's Olympics, state media reported Friday.


The August 8-24 sporting extravaganza will happen during normally
arid Beijing's rainy season when hail as well as water is often
seen, the Beijing Times said.


But the weather bureau plans to use advanced techniques to force
rain clouds to unload as far away as 90 kilometres (56 miles)
from the capital, the paper said.


Zhang Qiang, the head of the city's artificial weather management
office, told the newspaper that five aircraft and several
batteries of cannon and rockets will be used during the Olympics.


The system will be tested this year to ensure that it can work
next August when rain is expected to fall once every three days,
he said.


No details were released on exactly how the plan will work but
artificial rain is normally created by seeding clouds with
chemicals such as silver iodide spread by rockets and planes.


China claims a successful record of influencing the weather by
artificial means. Earlier this year official media reported that
snowfalls had been artificially generated by cloud seeding in the
north of the country.


This week the media reported that China had successfully created
artificial snowfalls in the mountainous region of Tibet, raising
hopes of a man-made solution to drought and melting glaciers
there.
