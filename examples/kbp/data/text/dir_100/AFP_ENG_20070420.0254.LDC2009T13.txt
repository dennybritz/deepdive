A British Royal Air Force Hawk jet crashed at an airfield in
Wales on Friday, although the pilot is thought to have ejected
safely, police said citing initial reports.


The crash happened at around midday (1100 GMT) near Mona airfield
on the island of Anglesey, northwest Wales.


In a statement, North Wales Police said that "initial reports
suggest that the pilot has ejected safely."


The Ministry of Defence said that a search and rescue helicopter
and mountain rescue team were on their way to the airfield.


The Hawk is a training aircraft built by British defence firm BAE
Systems.
