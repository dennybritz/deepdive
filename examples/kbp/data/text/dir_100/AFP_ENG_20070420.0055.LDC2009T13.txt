A moderate 5.1-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's Sumatra
island on Friday, seismologists said.


The undersea quake hit at 11:43 am (0443 GMT), 764 kilometres
(474 miles) southwest of Bengkulu province at a depth of 33
kilometres, the Indonesian meteorological agency said.


There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where
continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and volcanic
activity.


Indonesia was the nation worst hit by the earthquake-triggered
Asian tsunami in December 2004, which killed some 168,000 people
in Aceh province alone.
