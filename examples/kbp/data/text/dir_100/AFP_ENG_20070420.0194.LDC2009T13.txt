China's leading personal computer maker Lenovo Group announced a
restructuring plan including a net job cut of 650 positions, with
an aim to improve business performance and profits.


"To win in the PC (personal computer) industry, our path is very
clear," said William J. Amelio, Lenovo's president and chief
executive officer. "We must make our organization more efficient
by reducing expenses."


The company will axe approximately 1,400 jobs throughout the
Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or
roughly five percent of the group's global workforce, the company
said in a statement.


It plans to move 750 positions into emerging markets closer to
its suppliers and manufacturing operations and complete most of
the changes and cuts within a year, the statement said.


"The restructuring has been planned for quite a long time, mainly
because our operating efficiency in other markets than China is
not high enough," Lenovo spokesman Chen Ji told AFP Friday.


The statement said the company will pay around 50 million to 60
million dollars for compensation and other costs.


Savings from the restructuring is expected to reach 100 million
dollars, and Lenovo plans to reinvest the majority back into the
business to support the company's strategic initiatives, the
statement said.
