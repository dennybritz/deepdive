Dissident former MP Maamun Homsi, who fled into exile in Lebanon
earlier this year, called on Syrians on Friday to boycott this
weekend's parliamentary elections which he dubbed "illegimate".


"It's the security services that have been out campaigning...
while intellectuals, politicians and law-abiding citizens
languish in jail," Homsi said in a statement sent to AFP in
Beirut ahead of Sunday's poll.


"I add my voice to those of my brothers in the opposition in
calling on you not to take part in these elections so as to show
the whole world that they are illegitimate.


"The regime... has thrown the independent MPs in prison ... as a
lesson to all their colleagues and anyone else inclined to
criticise it."


Homsi was among a dozen dissidents detained in summer 2001 when
the authorities brought an end to the so-called Damascus spring,
the brief political opening that followed Bashar al-Assad's
succession to the presidency on the death of his father Hafez the
previous year.


He was sentenced to five years in prison for seeking to
"illegally change the constitution" and was eventually released
on January 18 this year with four other dissidents.


He fled to neighbouring Lebanon following the detention of
another fellow dissident -- Michel Kilo.


The ruling Baath party has dominated Syrian politics since a 1963
coup which imposed a state of emergency that remains in force to
this day.
