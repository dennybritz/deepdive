The newly-reformed Guns n' Roses have called off a upcoming tour
of South Africa after their guitarist suffered a freak injury
falling down the stairs, organisers announced Friday.


The US rock band, fronted by singer Axl Rose, had been due to
headline the My Coke Fest in Johannesburg on April 27 and in Cape
Town on May 1 but the injury sustained by bass guitarist Tommy
Stinson has scuppered their plans.


"I feel so bad right now," Stinson said in comments on the
sponsors' website.


"I accidentally fell down a flight of stairs. I put my hand down
to break my fall and heard a loud 'pop.' The next morning I went
to see my doctor, and the bad news is it's severely sprained and
I may have done some ligament damage."


Rose recently reformed the band with an overhauled line-up to
showcase a new albumn, "Chinese Democracy", which has been more
than a decade in waiting.
