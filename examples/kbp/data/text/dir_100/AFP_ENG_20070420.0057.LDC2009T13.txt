British chemists chain Alliance Boots recommended Friday a 10.6
billion pound (15.6 billion euro, 21.3 billion dollar) takeover
by private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and its deputy
chairman, Stefano Pessina.


If accepted by shareholders, the deal would be the biggest
takeover by a private equity firm in Britain and would make
Alliance Boots the first FTSE 100 firm to fall into private
hands.


The board accepted a deal of 1,090 pence per share. Pessina owns
a 15.05 percent share in Alliance Boots.


Shortly after the recommendation was announced, private equity
firm Terra Firma said it had put forward an indicative offer of
1,085 pence per share and urged shareholders not to accept the
KKR bid.


On Thursday, shares in Alliance Boots closed at 1,049.50 pence on
the London stock exchange.
