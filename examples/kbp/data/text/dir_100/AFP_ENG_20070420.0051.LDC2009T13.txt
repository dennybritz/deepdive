Australian share prices rose 0.69 percent Friday as a politive
lead from Wall Street helped the banking and resource sectors
bounce back from sharp losses on Thursday, dealers said.


The benchmark SP/ASX 200 closed up 42.4 points at 6,207.5 while
the broader All Ordinaries index rose 38.9 points to 6,187.2.
