Hong Kong customs officers said Friday they had arrested eight
Thai women smuggling heroin in their underwear for an
international syndicate.


The women hid the drug in bodily cavities and in shoe soles,
bras, underpants and sanitary napkins, the officers said.


They seized a total of six kilograms (13.2 pounds) of heroin
valued at 2.7 million Hong Kong dollars (346,000 US). The drugs
were smuggled to Hong Kong via India or Thailand.


Customs officers said that intelligence from their counterparts
in mainland China had helped to crack the case.


The women, aged 22 and 48, could face up to life in prison and a
fine of five million Hong Kong dollars.
