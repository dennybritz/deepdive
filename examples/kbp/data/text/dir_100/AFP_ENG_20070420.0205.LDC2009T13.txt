European airlines and their passengers will get an extra year
before hand luggage is subject to a new maximum limit, the
European Commission said Friday, announcing another delay with
the legislation.


As part of new safety measures, rules were to come into effect
from May that would have limited the size of hand luggage allowed
on airplanes flying in the EU to 56 centimetres by 45 centimetres
by 25 centimetres.


However the European Union's executive arm has accepted to push
the date back a year to May 6, 2008 to give airlines more time to
get ready, Commission spokesman for transport issues Michele
Cercone said.


It came after a six-month extension was announced last month.


The reason was again "to allow airlines and airports to better-
prepare the entry into force of the measure," Cercone told
reporters in Brussels.


The size limit is part of new EU security rules on hand luggage
drawn up after British authorities announced in August that they
had foiled an alleged plot to blow up US-bound airliners using
liquid explosives smuggled aboard.


Under rules that went into effect in November, liquids are only
allowed on board planes in small containers with a maximum
capacity of 100 millilitres.
