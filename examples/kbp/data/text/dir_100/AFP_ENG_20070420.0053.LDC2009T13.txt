North Korea said Friday it is holding "brisk" negotiations to
settle a banking dispute and it will start shutting down its
nuclear programme as soon as a settlement is reached.


The North will invite UN atomic agency inspectors "the moment the
actual defreezing of the frozen funds in the bank has been
confirmed," official media said.
