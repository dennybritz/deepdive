Fresh gunbattles between Islamic militants and government troops
in revolt-hit Indian Kashmir left two dead on Friday and sparked
a noisy demonstration, police and residents said.


Indian soldiers killed two militants during an early morning
skirmish in southern Pulwama, army spokesman A.K.Mathur said.


Another battle on the outskirts of the summer capital Srinagar
sparked an anti- government demonstration after troops, backed by
police, blew up a house where the rebels were reportedly hiding.


Police said the militants managed to escape from the building,
but residents insisted there were none there in the first place,
shouted anti-government slogans and demanded compensation.


The 17-year-old insurgency against Indian rule has left more than
42,000 people dead, according to official figures.
