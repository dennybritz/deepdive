SAP, the world's leading maker of business software, said on
Friday that earnings rose strongly in the first three months of
the current year, even if the increase fell short of
expectations.


SAP said in a statement that bottom-line net profit rose by 10
percent to 310 million euros (422 million dollar) in the period
from January to March.


Operating profit was up 6.0 percent at 433 million euros in the
first quarter on a 6.0-percent rise in revenues to 2.166 billion
euros, the statement said.


Revenues from software and software-related services, a key
benchmark for the sector because companies use them to generate
revenue from maintenance and consulting, rose by 9.0 percent to
1.519 billion euros.


While net profit and revenues were in line with analysts'
expectations, operating profit fell short of consensus forecasts.


SAP reaffirmed its full-year target for an increase of 12-14
percent in software and software-related service revenues.
