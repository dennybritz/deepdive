Australia's clash with Argentina has been postponed so the South
American giants can field a full-strength team in Melbourne,
Football Federation Australia (FFA) said Friday.


The Socceroos were scheduled to play two-time world champions
Argentina on June 6 but FFA said it had agreed to delay the match
until later in the year after being told the visitors would be
unable to bring their top players.


FFA said Argentina requested the delay because of commitments in
Europe. Officials agreed because they wanted fans at the
95,000-capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground to see the strongest
possible line-up.


"We agreed it would be in the best interests of both teams and
Australian football supporters to postpone the match to later
this year and we expect to confirm the new match date within the
next week or so," FFA chief executive Ben Buckley said.


He said the delay was caused by Argentina making commitments to
play in Europe after they had already agreed to the match Down
Under.


"We share our fans' disappointment about rescheduling the match,
but we hope that they will accept that a postponement was
necessary so that we will see a full-strength Argentina," he
said.


The Socceroos have two matches, against Uruguay on June 2, and
against Singapore on June 30, before they play their Asian Cup
group opener against Oman in Bangkok on July 8.
