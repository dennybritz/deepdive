A consortium headed by private equity firm Terra Firma said on
Friday it had bid 10.78 billion pounds for Europe's biggest
pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, beating an offer from private
equity firm KKR.


The offer, worth the equivalent of 15.87 billion euros and 21.60
billion dollars, trumps a improved bid by US group Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts which the Alliance Boots board had accepted
earlier Friday.


KKR, which is joined in its bid by the executive deputy chairman
of Alliance Boots, Stefano Pessina, offered 10.6 billion pounds.


Either takeover would represent Europe's biggest buyout by
private equity firms.
