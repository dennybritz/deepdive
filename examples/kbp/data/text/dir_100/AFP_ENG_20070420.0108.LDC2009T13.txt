A Russian theatre company is planning to stage a new ballet on
the life and death of Britain's Princess Diana, the Izvestia
newspaper reported on Friday.


The Premera company has engaged British dancer and director
Gillian Lynne to choreograph the performance, provisionally set
to open in the autumn at Moscow's Stanislavsky-Nemirovich-
Danchenko Musical Theatre, said the mass circulation daily.


The lead role will be danced by renowned Russian dancer Ilze
Liepa, the paper said.


While Diana's relatives have taken exception to previous stagings
of her life, in Britain such qualms are rarely allowed to prevent
such projects going ahead, the paper commented.
