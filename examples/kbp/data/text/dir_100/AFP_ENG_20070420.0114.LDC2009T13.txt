Kidnappers in Paraguay on Friday released a Japanese member of
Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church and two Paraguayans after 19
days in captivity, the church said.


An armed group of bandits demanding ransom snatched two Japanese
members of the church and two locals at the beginning of the
month in Caaguazu, about 200 kilometres (120 miles) east of the
capital Asuncion.


The church said the armed group released Hirokazu Ota, 62, along
with a Paraguayan policeman and his girlfriend seized by chance
when they witnessed the kidnapping.


Ota is the president of Victoria S.A., a company that manages the
church's assets in Paraguay.


The Unification Church in Tokyo was informed of their release in
a call from an employee of the company, said church spokesman
Tomohisa Ota.


"Mr. Ota himself had called up the company and told them he and
the two Paraguayans were all safe," the spokesman said.


Ota's secretary, Sawako Takayama, was also kidnapped but released
earlier this month.
