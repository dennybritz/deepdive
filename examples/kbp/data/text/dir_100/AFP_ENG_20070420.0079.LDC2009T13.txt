An ethnic rights group called a three-day strike in southern
Nepal starting Friday, police and activists said.


The strike was called "as part of our continued protest for
regional autonomy and greater political representation," Upendra
Jha, a senior member of the Mahadhesi People's Rights Forum
(MJF), told AFP.


The strike has seen some districts come to a standstill but in
others it has not been fully observed, police said.


Nepal's government has invited the MJF for talks and the ethnic
group has "taken it (the talks offer) positively," Jha told AFP.


At least 60 people have been killed in unrest since January in
Nepal's southern plains region bordering India, in violence that
has cast a shadow over a peace deal between the government and
former Maoist insurgents.


Home to around half of Nepal's population, the Terai region is
known as the country's bread basket and has traditionally been
under-represented in national politics.


Mahadhesi protests escalated in January after Maoist activists
shot and killed an MJF supporter who was imposing a road
blockade.


Late last month, 29 Maoist supporters were killed in clashes
between the extreme leftists and the ethnic group.


The Maoists have accused the king and his supporters of backing
the ethnic group in an effort to undermine the peace deal, which
could see the country ditch the monarchy.
