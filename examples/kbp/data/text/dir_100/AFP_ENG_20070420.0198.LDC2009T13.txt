Some 213,000 Somalis have fled fierce fighting in the capital,
Mogadishu, in the past two months, the UN refugee agency said
Friday, warning that the flow was continuing.


"Nearly half of those who have fled have sought safety in the
adjacent provinces of the Middle and Lower Shabelle. People are
reported to still be fleeing the capital," said Ron Redmond, a
spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.


The UNHCR's local aid workers began distributing relief supplies
to 40,000 displaced people in the town of Afgooye, 30 kilometres
(20 miles) west of the capital, on Thursday, he added.


However, the road into Afgooye was later cut by an explosion, and
there were fears that aid distribution would be hampered again,
Redmond warned.


The UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, Eric Laroche, warned
on Thursday that a humanitarian catastrophe was looming unless
heavy fighting subsides and access for relief aid is opened up,
especially around Mogadishu.


Fighting between Ethiopian forces and Islamist insurgents resumed
in the Somali capital Friday with exchanges of machine-gun fire
and mortar shells, witnesses said.


The United Nations wants to deliver relief aid to about one
million people in Somalia, including a total of more than 400,000
displaced, over the next six months.
