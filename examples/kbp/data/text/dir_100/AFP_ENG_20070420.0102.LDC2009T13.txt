A radical Islamist was killed and two other people including a
police officer were wounded in a pre-dawn shootout in Serbia's
tense south on Friday, reports said.


The incident occurred shortly before 5:00 am (0300 GMT) in a
village near Novi Pazar, the main town in the Muslim populated
Sandzak region, police said according to Tanjug and Beta news
agencies.


Police had tried enter a house to arrest a leader as part of an
ongoing crackdown against the group of Wahhabis -- Muslims who
practice a traditional values of Sunni Islam promoted by
extremists.


They opened fire on the house after a hand grenade was thrown at
them, killing one of them and wounding another, said the reports,
adding one police officer was wounded and one of the suspects was
arrested.


Police had targetted the radical Islamists over suspicions they
were planning terrorist attacks, said the reports.


The shootout comes a month after Serbian police arrested five
Wahhabi Muslims who were suspected of planning "terrorist"
attacks in the country after uncovering a large haul of weapons
in a cave near Sandzak's Velika Ninaja mountain.


Authorities have blamed the radicalisation of Sandzak, whose
420,000 population is 45 percent Muslim, on tensions between two
of the region's rival Muslim political parties.
