US ally Kuwait is to form an emergency team to draw up
contingency plans for any conflict between the United States and
Iran, a senior minister said in comments published Friday.


"The team ... will devise a comprehensive contingency plan to
deal with  risks that may result in case a war breaks out in the
Gulf on the back of the rising US military escalation towards
Iran," State Minister for Cabinet Affairs Faisal al-Hajji told
the Al-Watan daily.


The cabinet will form the team at its weekly meeting on Sunday,
drawing on officials from the defence, interior, oil and health
ministries as well as the fire and civil defence departments,
Hajji said.


The team is then due to hold its first meeting on Monday.


The Kuwaiti parliament is scheduled to hold a special debate on
May 1 on the government's readiness for any military
confrontation between the United States and Iran.


Washington has said that it would prefer to address its concerns
about Tehran's nuclear programme diplomatically but has refused
to rule out the option of military action.


It has beefed up its military presence in the Gulf and currently
has a second aircraft carrier there for the first time since the
2003 invasion of Iraq.


Kuwait served as the launchpad for that invasion and remains the
main staging point for US-led troops in Iraq.


Around 15,000 US troops are stationed at a series of bases in the
emirate, the largest of them at Arifjan, south of Kuwait City
near the border with Saudi Arabia.
