Hong Kong share prices face volatile trade next week on concerns
over US economic outlook and China's possible measures to cool
down its economy, dealers said Friday.


China is widely expected to adopt further macro-economic
tightening measures after first-quarter gross domestic product
growth and March inflation came in stronger than expected.


"Because of the strong Chinese data, investors are worried that
the government may further tighten monetary policy and hike
interest rates. This would affect the Chinese markets,"said DBS
sales director Peter Lai.


"In the short term, I expect the Hong Kong market to be violatile
and will be more sentiment and news driven," he added.


But Michael Chan, head of research at CSC Securities, said any
announcement on new monetary measures could have muted impact
next week.


"The (rate) increase has been discounted by the market. Moreover,
investors are unfazed... because of strong liquidity in the
market. They feel a rate hike will have little effect on market
performance while liquidity is strong," Chan said.


Dealers said investors will closely watch the economic data
coming out of the US to gauge the state of the country's economy.


"Traditional blue chips could affect the performance of Wall
Street and this will affect the Hong Kong market," Lai said.


Data to be announced next week includes first-quarter gross
domestic product, consumer confidence for April, existing homes
sales for March and weekly jobless claims.


In the week to April 20, the benchmark Hang Seng Index rose
225.62 points or 1.1 percent to 20,566.59.


Lai expects the main index will trade at a support level of
19,800 points.
