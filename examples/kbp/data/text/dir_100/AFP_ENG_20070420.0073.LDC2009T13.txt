The private equity consortium bidding to take over Australian
national airline Qantas revealed Friday that the number of
shareholders signed up to its offer has dropped for the second
time this week.


Airline Partners Australia (APA) said shareholder acceptances for
its 9.0 billion US dollar offer had fallen to 27.48 percent, down
1.38 percentage points since Wednesday.


The Macquarie bank-led consortium needs 70 percent acceptances
for its 5.45 dollars (4.38 US) a share bid to succeed but has
been going backwards since its previous market update a two weeks
ago, when it had 30.06 percent of the stock.


APA offered no explanation for the fall in acceptances in a
statement to the Australian Stock Exchange.


The latest update came as financial giant Credit Suisse informed
the market that it had increased its stake in Qantas from 7.2
percent to 8.54 percent.


At least one institutional investor, Balanced Equity Management,
has said it will not sell its 4.0 percent stake in Qantas because
it believes the APA offer undervalues the airline.


Analysts have upgraded their results forecasts for Qantas since
the takeover bid was launched late last year and the airline
itself expects this year's annual net profit to be up to 40
percent higher than the previous year.


It has already revised profit expectations upwards three times in
the past four months.


Qantas shares closed up one cent at 5.37 dollars in a rising
overall market.
