French oil group Total said on Friday it had been authorised to
explore for oil in 750 square kilometers (289 square miles) off
the coast of the US coast of Alaska for the next 10 years.


The contract was won by the oil group's 100 percent owned
subsidiary Total E&P USA.


Total said in a statement it had taken part in the tender as part
of its strategy of "concentrating in areas with strong long term
potential."


The offer requires US regulatory approval.
