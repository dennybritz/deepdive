Singapore aims to become a centre for research in environmental
sustainability, the government said Friday as a major UN-backed
conference on climate change ended in the city-state.


Tony Tan, chairman of the National Research Foundation (NRF),
made the announcement in Zurich after a Singapore delegation
visited leading European organisations dealing in water and clean
energy research.


"With growing concerns about the global environment, Singapore,
like other developed nations, needs to have long term sustainable
solutions for the supply of water and clean energy," NRF said in
a press release.


"Being a compact city state, Singapore is also an ideal test-bed
for new technologies in these areas."


It said the delegation "affirmed the republic's aim to become a
centre for research in environmental sustainability."


Hundreds of the world's business executives and environment
experts met in Singapore on Thursday and Friday to discuss the
need for more global corporations to join the fight against
climate change.


Last year a report commissioned by the British government warned
that climate change could bring economic disaster on the scale of
the world wars and the 1930s Great Depression unless urgent
action was taken.
