South Korea's police chief Lee Taek-Soon Friday sent condolences
to families of victims of the US university massacre and offered
to help in the investigation if requested.


Monday's massacre at Virginia Tech, in which 32 students and
staff were shot dead, was carried out by a South Korean student
who had been living in the US since 1992.


Cho Seung-Hui, 23, a student at Virginia Tech with a history of
mental problems, killed himself after his rampage.


Lee, head of the National Police Agency, is due to visit the
Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of a previously scheduled
five-day trip to the US that starts on Monday.


South Koreans reacted with shock and sadness to the killings and
the news that the perpetrator was a compatriot.


President Roh Moo-Hyun sent condolences to the American people
and President George W. Bush, a commemorative altar was set up in
Seoul's Myeongdong Cathedral and candlelit mourning vigils have
been held.


Cho's grandfather had told local media he remembered his grandson
as a smart boy but said his childhood silence worried his
parents.


Cho's parents left for the United States in search of a better
life, especially for their children.


Many South Koreans have expressed fears of a racially motivated
backlash against compatriots living in the United States.
Messages from Americans printed in local papers have said they do
not consider Cho's ethnicity as a factor in the tragedy.
