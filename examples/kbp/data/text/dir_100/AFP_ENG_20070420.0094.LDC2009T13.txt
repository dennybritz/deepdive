China is facing a minor baby boom and paradoxically it all comes
down to a special rule in the nation's draconian one-child
policy, state media reported Friday.


Limits on the number of children couples are allowed were
introduced in 1979 to control the Chinese population.


But the Xinhua news agency reported that one of the law's rules
said couples in which both man and wife were raised as single
children are now authorized to have two babies.


As the one-child policy was implemented nearly 30 years ago, many
present day urban Chinese of child-bearing age fall into that
category.


"There will be an increase in births in coming years," Xinhua
reported, citing Zhang Weiqing, director of the State Population
and Family Planning Commission.


Under the one child policy couples living in cities are allowed
to have just one child, while in the countryside parents can have
a second if the first-born is a girl.


According to previous forecasts by the commission, China's
population is expected to reach 1.36 billion by 2010 and 1.45
billion by 2020.


The nation's numbers are expected to peak at 1.5 billion people
in 2033, posing huge challenges to social stability, the economy,
the environment and resources.
