Two South Korean soldiers were found shot dead at a military base
on Friday, the army said.


The corporals, both in their 20s, were on guard duty at an
ammunition depot when a fellow soldier heard shots, according to
an army official quoted by Yonhap news agency.


"The army is investigating the incident," the official said.


The soldiers were carrying loaded K-1 rifles at the time of the
incident at an engineering unit at Heongseong in the northeastern
province of Gangwon.


One soldier surnamed Lee was shot in the neck and the second
surnamed Han was shot in the stomach. All the shots appeared to
have been fired from Lee's rifle, the official said.


There was no further information on the cause of the shooting.


In 2005 a private at a guard post on the front line with North
Korea went on a bloody rampage with grenades and a machine gun,
killing eight of his comrades.


The 680,000-strong military is largely made up of young
conscripts, who sometimes complain of bullying and violence at
the hands of superiors.
