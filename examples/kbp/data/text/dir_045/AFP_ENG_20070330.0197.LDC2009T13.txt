Demonstrators plan to rally here Saturday for the release of two
Afghans still held in their country after an Italian journalist
with whom they are linked was freed, organisers said.


Ajmal Naqshbandi, an interpreter, was captured in the southern
province of Helmand on March 4 with Italian journalist Daniele
Mastrogiacomo, who was freed around two weeks later, and an
Afghan driver who was beheaded.


Rahmatullah Hanefi, head of staff at a hospital run by Emergency,
the Italian non-governmental organisation which played a key role
in the freeing of the Italian, is believed to be held by the
Afghan secret services.


The Rome protest is planned for 1230 GMT, according to
Peacereporter, an on-line information site set up by Emergency.


Writing in Friday's edition of his newspaper La Repubblica,
Mastrogiacomo said he was "concerned, worried, touched" by the
fate of the two Afghans and called for their immediate release.


A key Taliban leader threatened on Thursday to execute Naqshbandi
unless President Hamid Karzai entered into negotiations for the
man's release, according to a video message.


Mastrogiacomo was freed in exchange for Taliban prisoners in a
deal that angered many Afghans and prompted the United States and
other countries to condemn negotiations with "terrorists."
