EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen will visit China next
week for talks on economic relations as part of plans for a new
partnership pact, the European Commission said Friday.


Verheugen, who is also a vice-president of the European Union's
executive arm, was due to meet with high-level politicians during
his trip to Beijing from Sunday to Wednesday, it said.


The German commissioner would raise such issues as energy
efficiency and climate change, improving cooperation on
regulatory issues, the economy, technology, consumer protection
and safety.


China and the EU launched negotiations in January on broadening
an existing economic and commercial treaty into other fields such
as the environment.
