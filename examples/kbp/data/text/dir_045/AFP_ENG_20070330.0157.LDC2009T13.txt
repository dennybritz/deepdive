European football governing body UEFA confirmed Friday that they
will consider awarding a place in the Champions League to Cup
winners from 2009.


The proposal could see the winner of each country's main knockout
tournament included in a new end-of-season play-off system or
even granted an automatic berth to Europe's elite club
competition.


William Gaillard, UEFA's communications director, said: "This is
one of many, many ideas that are being discussed. It will go
before our new strategic council in June and a final decision
will be taken in September.


"Many ideas are circulating of contrasting views and this one is
that the cup winners from countries with more than one qualifying
team for the Champions League would go into the tournament.


"Many people like cup competitions and feel that the end of
European Cup Winners Cup has been a raw deal for the cup winners.


"It would need the agreement of the clubs, leagues and national
associations so if they support it, it will go forward or it
might just disappear.


"A number of clubs have expressed an interest in this situation."


UEFA's new strategic committee will have representatives from
European's football governing body, the players' union FIFPro,
the leagues and the clubs.


It will also be asked to look at an idea put forward by UEFA
president Michel Platini that would see the lowest qualifying
teams from England, Italy, Spain, Germany, France and Portugal
playing off against each other for three places in the group
stage of the Champions League.
