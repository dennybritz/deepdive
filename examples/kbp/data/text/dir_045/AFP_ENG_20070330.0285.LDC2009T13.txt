Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday that Britain wanted Iran to
be "increasingly isolated" in the stand-off over 15 British
detainees, but vowed to be patient in managing the crisis.


He said that the "parading and manipulation" of British service
personnel would fool no-one, adding that videos of them would
only increase a "sense of disgust" at Iran's behaviour.
