Russian police on Friday raided the offices of Norwegian oil
services and engineering group Aker Kvaerner in Moscow in a
dispute between the company and a former Russian business
partner, the group said.


"We received a visit from the Russian police at our Moscow
offices this morning," Aker Kvaerner spokesman Torbjoern Andersen
told AFP.


In a statement, the company said the raid was part of "a
complaint from a former Russian business partner" after Aker
Kvaerner's acquisition of 56 percent of Astrakhan Korabel, a
Russian shipyard specialised in oil services in the Caspian
region.


"We were the guarantors of a loan taken by Astrakhan Korabel, and
in exchange we were to receive Astrakhan Korabel shares if it
failed to pay back the loan," Andersen said.


"When we saw that the loan could not be repaid, we informed them
of our right to 56 percent of the shares in the shipyard," he
added.


It is this point that is being contested by the "former Russian
business partner," whom Aker Kvaerner did not identify but who
holds 0.2 percent of Astrakhan Korabel, the Norwegian group said.


Aker Kvaerner's Moscow office employs 14 people and is a "local
representation office that examines new concrete projects in
Russia."


It said it would "cooperate fully" with Russian authorities.
