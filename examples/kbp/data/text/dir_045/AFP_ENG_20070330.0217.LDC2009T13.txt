Russian police on Friday raided the offices of Norwegian oil
services and engineering group Aker Kvaerner in Moscow, the group
announced, saying it did not know the reason for the police
action.


"We received a visit from the Russian police at our Moscow
offices this morning," Aker Kvaerner spokesman Torbjoern Andersen
told AFP.


"We don't know what it's all about but we are trying to
understand," he said, adding that Aker Kvaerner was "cooperating
fully with Russian authorities."


The Moscow office has some 20 employees and is a "local
representation office that examines new concrete projects in
Russia."


According to Norwegian financial daily Dagens Naeringsliv on
Friday, Aker Kvaerner and its parent company Aker -- which owns
40.1 percent of Aker Kvaerner -- are planning a vast project in
Russia aimed at manufacturing oil and gas production
installations and taking an active role in oil exploitation.


Andersen said he "saw no link" between the reports and the police
raid.
