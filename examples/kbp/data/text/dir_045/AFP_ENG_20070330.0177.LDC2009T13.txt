Explosives uncovered in a raid on a militants' hideout in central
Indonesia could have caused more damage than the 2002 Bali
bombings that killed 202 people, police said Friday.


"If those materials were assembled, its capacity could be bigger
than bombs used in 2002 Bali bombings," Indonesian police chief
Sutanto told reporters.


Police last week found 625 kilogrammes (1,375 pounds) of
potassium, 200 detonators and 20 kilogrammes of TNT in a bunker
under a house in Sukoharjo, 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of the
city of Yogyakarta.


Sutanto said extremists trained in assembling explosives were
still at large despite the raid and several others targeting
militants in recent days.


Indonesian anti-terror police have shot dead one suspected member
of the terror group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and arrested seven
others in recent days.


The arrests led to the Sukoharjo raid and others that uncovered
hidden arsenals of guns, ammunition and explosives.


"Mujahid alias Brekele and Upik Lawanga who were arrested in Palu
and Poso (on Sulawesi island) have skills assembling explosives,"
he said.


Indonesia's police Detachment 88, a US-trained unit, has killed
or arrested more than 200 JI members, according to Singapore-
based terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna.


JI has been blamed for the 2002 bombings on the Indonesian resort
island and other bloody attacks mainly targeting Western
interests.
