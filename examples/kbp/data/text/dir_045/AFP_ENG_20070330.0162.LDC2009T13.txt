An Indonesian doctor who fell ill after treating patients
suffering from the deadly bird flu virus was improving, a fellow
doctor said Friday.


The 29-year-old doctor was hospitalised on Thursday after
developing symptoms similar to bird flu, raising concerns of
human-to-human transfer of the deadly virus.


"His condition is improving, his fever is down and x-ray results
came back good," said Hadi Yusuf, a doctor who treats patients
with the virus at the Hasan Sadikin hospital in West Java.


However the sick doctor, identified only by one of his initials
S, will remain in isolation at the hospital until the results of
tests were known.


The tests have been sent to the Ministry of Health's laboratory
in Jakarta.


Samples are usually taken on the first, third and seventh day
after a patient is hospitalised to determine if they have bird
flu.


There are currently four other patients suspected of contracting
the virus in isolation at the same hospital, including two
children aged four and six.


Indonesia has the highest death toll from the virus with 69
deaths out of 89 cases.


Scientists worry the virus could mutate into a form easily spread
among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential to
kill millions.


The WHO says the deadly H5N1 strain has infected 284 people
worldwide and killed 169 of them, mostly in Southeast Asia, since
the end of 2003.
