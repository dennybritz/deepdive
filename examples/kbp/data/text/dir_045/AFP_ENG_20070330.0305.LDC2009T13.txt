Australian David Hicks appeared before a US military tribunal on
Friday to recount how he trained with Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan as
he awaits sentencing on a terrorism charge in Guantanamo.


Hicks, had pleaded guilty earlier this week to a charge of
lending "material support to terrorism" in the first case to be
heard by the special military tribunals set up to try "war on
terror" detainees.


Instead of khaki prison garb, Hicks appeared in a blue suit
Friday. His hair, which he had grown down his back in prison, was
cut short.


Hicks must affirm the facts underlying the charge before the
military judge, Colonel Ralph Kohlmann, accepts his guilty plea.


A panel of at least five commissioned military officers will then
hand down a sentence, which Hicks will be allowed to serve out in
his native Australia as part of an agreement between the two
countries.
