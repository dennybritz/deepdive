A diplomatic note from Iran to British authorities condemned an
"illegal act" by British naval personnel in the Gulf last week,
but did not call for an apology, according to the text released
Friday.


Iran "protests strongly against this illegal act in violating
Iranian territorial waters (and) underlines the responsibility of
the British government for the consequences," said the note,
released by Iran's embassy.


The note, given by Iran's foreign ministry to Britain's embassy
in Tehran on Thursday, also "calls for the guarantee to avoid the
recurrence of such acts," but makes no demand for an apology.


The Foreign Office said earlier it was giving the note "serious
consideration," but had no immediate reaction to it.


Meanwhile hardline Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said
Britain should apologise for "violating' Iran's territorial
waters, according to state television in Tehran.


Britain has repeatedly refused to apologise, insisting its 15
sailors and marines were well within Iraqi territorial waters
when they were detained at gunpoint by Iranian patrol boats in
the northern Gulf last Friday.
