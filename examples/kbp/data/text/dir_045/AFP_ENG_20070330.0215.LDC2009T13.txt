Liverpool's Norwegian defender John Arne Riise was declared
bankrupt by Liverpool County Court on Friday for an unpaid debt
of around 100,000 pounds (196,000 dollars).


Riise, who earns an estimated 50,000 pounds a week, is involved
in a legal battle with his former agent, Einar Baardsen, whom he
has accused of swindling him out of three million pounds (5.9
million dollars).


Riise's legal team are reported to be preparing to go back to
court to have the bankruptcy order annulled.
