Sri Lankan war planes bombed suspected Tamil Tiger positions
Friday after the rebels blew up five soldiers and allegedly
killed eight civilians in shelling, officials said.


Supersonic jets bombed rebel-held territory after the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) set off a road side bomb and
ambushed a military vehicle, killing five soldiers and wounding
another, the military said.


"We have hit three LTTE targets today," a spokesman for the Sri
Lankan airforce said. He said there were no details on
casualties.


The military also reported eight civilians were killed in
shelling in the east of the island, where the two sides have been
locked in long-range attacks.


The defence ministry said the civilians were killed as a result
of firing by Tamil Tiger rebels into populated areas of
Batticaloa district. There was no immediate comment from the
Tigers.


There has been heavy fighting between the two sides in the
coastal Batticaloa region, where the military captured a Tiger
base on Wednesday.


The Tiger rebels are leading a drawn out campaign for
independence. More than 4,000 people have been killed in the
latest wave of fighting since December 2005 despite a truce
arranged by peace broker Norway in 2002.
