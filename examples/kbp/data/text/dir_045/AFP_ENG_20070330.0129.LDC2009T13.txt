At least five fans were ejected from the men's water polo semi-
final between bitter foes Croatia and Serbia amid tight security
at the world championships Friday.


An estimated 100 police were inside and outside the Melbourne
Sports and Aquatic Centre to avoid a repeat of the ethnic clashes
between the two sets of supporters that marred the Australian
Open tennis tournament here in January.


One fan was escorted from the stands by police prior to the match
commencing while at least four more were thrown off the premises
after a flare was set off inside the venue after the opening
Croatian goal.


Croatia stunned the reigning world champions and gold medal
favourites Serbia 10-7 to book a spot in Sunday's final.


In January, more than 150 people were barred from the tennis at
Melbourne Park after Serbian and Croatian fans kicked and beat
each other with flagpoles.


There has been a long history of clashes between Serb and Croat
fans in Melbourne but it has previously been restricted to
football matches between teams representing the two Balkan
communities.
