The Italian Senate on Friday approved deregulation measures
drafted by the center-left government of Prime Minister Romano
Prodi aimed at boosting competition in retail commerce and
services.


The upper house voted 161 to 153 to back several dozen changes
designed to make life easier -- and cheaper -- for the consumer,
such as eliminating cell phone charges, allowing bakers to sell
newspapers and increasing sales outlets for petrol, notably at
supermarkets.


Service station managers staged a strike in February over the
deregulation of petrol sales.


A vote on the measures in the lower Chamber of Deputies passed
easily last week, however. With backing by the Senate the
measures can now take effect.


Consumer associations calculate that the changes will save the
average family some 550 euros (730 dollars) a year.


A first wave of deregulatory measures last June allowed greater
competition in the sale of medicines as well as in banking
services and among taxi drivers.
