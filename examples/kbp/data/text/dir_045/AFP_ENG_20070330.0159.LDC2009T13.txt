British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett voiced hopes Friday
for a peaceful resolution to Iran's detention of  15 British
naval personnel, and said she hoped for a message of support from
her EU colleagues.


"Our indications are that our EU colleagues are completely aware
of the circumstances and are fully supportive and of course we
appreciate that.


"We hope certainly that a statement will come out from the EU
today," she told reporters as she arrived at the start of a two-
day meeting of EU foreign ministers.


Britain froze official contacts on Wednesday with Iran as the
dispute over 15 detained sailors intensified, with Prime Minister
Tony Blair vowing to "ratchet up" pressure on the Islamic state.
