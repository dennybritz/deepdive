Fifty-six people have been killed in battles between Pakistani
tribesmen and foreign Al-Qaeda militants near the Afghan border,
interior minister Aftab Sherpao told AFP Friday.


"Fifty-four people were killed today, two were yesterday. They
include 45 foreigners. The fighting is going on, it intensified
today after peace talks failed," Sherpao said.


"Tribes are insisting on their demand that these people either
surrender or quit the area."
