Slovakian-based car producers boosted turnover by 34.0 percent in
2006 to 443 billion koruna (13.3 billion euros, 17.7 billion
dollars) compared with a year earlier, the country's auto
industry association said on Friday.


"A record figure was reached last year. All three producers
contributed," association president, Jozef Uhrik, said referring
to the local units of Volkswagen, Peugeot Citroen and South
Korean-based Kia Motors.


Last year the three companies produced 295,390 cars. That total
should rise to around 500,000 this year and around 800,000 by
2010, making 5.4 million strong Slovakia "a world power" for per
capital car production, according to Uhrik.


Almost all of last year's production, which accounted for 28.4
percent of the country's overall industrial output, was exported,
he added.
