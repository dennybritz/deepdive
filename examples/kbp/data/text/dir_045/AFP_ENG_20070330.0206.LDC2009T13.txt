Authorities in Benin have confirmed they will hold legislative
elections on Saturday, after postponing the polls originally
scheduled for March 25.


The election is a crucial test for Benin's President Yayi Boni, a
virtual political unknown who was the surprise winner of the
presidential poll in March last year.


The election was originally set for March 25. But on the eve of
the vote, the Constitutional Court decided to delay the polls
until the end of the month due to difficulties in organising
them.


Ballots were found not to be ready, while the equipment had not
been transported and poll workers had still not been trained.


But the national electoral committee which has been tasked with
organising the vote said Friday it was now ready.


"We have deployed all sensitive equipment in northern areas since
yesterday. In the south it is being supplied," committee
spokesman Michel Allokpo told AFP.


"Training of polling station officials has also been finished
since yesterday and we are ready for the election," he added.


Polling stations will open at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) Saturday
throughout the west African country and close at 4:00 pm (1400
GMT).


Some four million people are eligible to vote in the election
that will choose 83 members of the legislature from among 2,158
candidates from 26 political parties and groups.


Elected last year with 74 percent of the vote, Boni, a former
banker, made economic growth and the fight against corruption a
major plank of his campaign.
