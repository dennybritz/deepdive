Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that Britain should
apologise for "violating' its territorial waters after the
seizure of 15 British naval personnel in Gulf waters a week ago,
state television reported on Friday.


"In recent years British forces have violated international law
and crossed the Iranian border. Britain should apologise to
Iran," Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying in a telephone
conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
