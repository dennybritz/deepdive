Hong Kong share prices are likely to move in a narrow range next
week as investors are concerned over rising crude oil prices and
the economic outlook in the United States, dealers said Friday.


They said investors will closely monitor fresh economic data to
gauge the state of the economy in the US.


"Investors would want to know if the US economy is slowing and
this will affect the Wall Street which will have an impact on
Hong Kong," said Castor Pang, strategist at Sun Hung Kai
Financial Group.


The US will release next week unemployment figures and ISM
manufacturing sector index for March as well as consumer credit
for February.


Kitty Chan, director at Celestial Asia Securities, said, oil
prices will be another focus in the market.


She said there has been caution about the mounting tension
between Iran and the West, driving crude oil prices in recent
days.


"The market will keep an eye on the oil price movement and some
data from the US in the near term," she said.


Pang said while he expects a rangebound trade next week, he
believes the market should stablise soon as there are signs that
funds have begun to flow back into the city.


For the week ending March 30, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was
up 108.29 points or 0.55 percent at 19,800.93.


Pang expects the index to trade at a support level of 19,400
points and could test 20,000-point mark.
