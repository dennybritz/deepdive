Malaysian rider Josiah Ng was stretchered off the the piste at
the world track championships here on Friday after a nasty crash
in the keirin.


Ng was racing in the first heat of the first round of the
chaotic, eight-lap event when he appeared to clip his front wheel
before hitting the boards hard and sliding to a halt.


Italian Roberto Chiappa was later disqualified from the heat
after it was ruled he caused the crash.


Ng appeared to injure his shoulder in the spectacular crash,
which came well before the six other racers began jostling for
position for the final sprint to the finish.


It is not yet known if Ng, who is a keirin specialist, will be
able to continue in the competition.
