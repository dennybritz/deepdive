British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said on Friday she saw
no sign that Iran was seeking to solve a growing crisis by
releasing 15 British naval personnel.


"We have been looking for a way out from the very beginning. I
wish I saw any sign that this is what Iran is trying to do,"
Beckett told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting of EU
foreign ministers in Germany.
