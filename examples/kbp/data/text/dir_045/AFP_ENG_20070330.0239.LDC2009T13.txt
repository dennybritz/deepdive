Volkswagen AG officially opened a new engine plant in northeast
China Friday, expanding its presence in one of the world's
fastest growing automobile market.


Volkswagen and its partner China FAW Group Corp plan to invest a
total of 1.5 billion yuan (194 million dollar) in the plant,
located in the port city of Dalian, by the end of 2011,
Volkswagen Group China said in a statement.


"Together with our partners we decided to further improve the
current high- standard technology by introducing the latest
engine-generation from Europe in China," Winfried Vahland, CEO of
Volkswagen Group China said.


The engine venture is 60 percent owned by Volkswagen, with FAW
holding the remainder, it said.


The German carmarker aimed to reduce consumption and emissions by
more than 20 percent by 2010 for VW's entire fleet of models made
in China, the statement said.
