Oil prices surged beyond 69 dollars a barrel and hit a near-
seven-month high Friday on mounting tension between Iran and
Britain over the continued Iranian detention of 15 British naval
personnel.


In London trade, the price of Brent North Sea crude for May
delivery reached 69.14 dollars a barrel -- the highest level
since September 4 last year.


It later stood at 68.91 dollars in electronic trading, up 1.03
dollars.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, climbed 63 cents to 66.66 dollars in electronic
deals before the official opening of the US market.


New York crude had Tuesday soared to 68.09 dollars -- a level
last seen in early September -- on rumours of military conflict
with Iran.


"It wouldn't surprise me if we saw 70 (dollars a barrel) quite
easily or beyond," said Simon Hayley, senior international
economist at Capital Economics.
