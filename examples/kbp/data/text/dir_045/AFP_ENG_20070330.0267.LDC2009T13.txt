A judge fined the company which manages Britain's train
infrastructure four million pounds (7.8 million dollars, 5.9
million euros) Friday over a 1999 crash which killed 31 people.


Network Rail was found guilty of "systemic and unacceptable"
safety failures over the crash near London's Paddington station,
which also left more than 400 people injured in one of Britain's
worst-ever train tragedies.


London's Blackfriars Crown Court heard that a "catalogue of
failures" spanned several years and was the result of "the
culture at the top."


Network Rail is the successor to Railtrack, the body responsible
at the time of the crash.


The crash occurred on October 5, 1999, when a local train, which
had just left Paddington station, passed through a partially-
obscured red signal and crashed head-on with an express train,
with a combined impact speed of 130 miles (210 kilometres) per
hour.
