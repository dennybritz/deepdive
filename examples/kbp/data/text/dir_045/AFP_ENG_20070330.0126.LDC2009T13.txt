The unemployment rate in the 13 nations sharing the euro eased in
February to a new record low of 7.3 percent, official figures
showed on Friday.


The rate, which the European Union's Eurostat data agency
adjusted to take seasonal variations into account, is the lowest
on Eurostat's books, which go back to 1993.


It marked a slight decrease from a rate of 7.4 percent reported
for January and a steady descent from the 8.2 percent registered
for February 2006.


Since peaking at 8.9 percent during an extended period ending in
September 2004, unemployment in the eurozone has steadily
declined as the economy gathers pace.


In the EU as a whole, unemployment eased to 7.4 percent -- the
lowest rate in Eurostat's records for the bloc going back to 1998
-- in February from 7.5 percent in January and 8.2 percent in
February 2006.


Europe's stubbornly high unemployment rates have long been one of
the biggest problems faced by the bloc's politicians, who have
often ignored many economists' recommendations to ease labour
market rules on hiring and firing to tackle the problem.
