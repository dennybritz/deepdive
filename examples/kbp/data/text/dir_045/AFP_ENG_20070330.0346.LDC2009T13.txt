DBS Bank has received approval to set up Singapore's first
Islamic bank, Southeast Asia's largest lender said late Friday.


DBS said it had received confirmation that the Monetary Authority
of Singapore is prepared to grant a new bank licence to a DBS
joint venture company for the Islamic bank.


"The Islamic bank's shareholders will comprise DBS, as a majority
shareholder, and prominent investors from the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries," DBS said in a statement.


The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and
the United Arab Emirates.


The Islamic bank will initially offer corporate, capital market
and private banking services, DBS said.


Earlier Friday, DBS held an Islamic banking dialogue and said it
wants to be a major player in the 300-billion US dollar global
Islamic financial market. It said it has engaged four Islamic
scholars to help the bank achieve the goal.


DBS began its serious foray into Islamic finance last year when
the bank was granted a licence to operate in Dubai where it has
opened a flagship branch there offering wholesale banking
products and services.


Singapore faces rivalry from neighbours Malaysia and Brunei in
chasing Islamic funds.


The Middle Eastern-owned Asian Finance Bank on Wednesday launched
operations as Malaysia's third foreign-owned Islamic bank and
said it would use the country as a hub to expand regionally.


Islamic finance fuses principles of sharia or Islamic law and
modern banking. Funds are banned from investing in companies
associated with tobacco, alcohol or gambling considered taboo by
Muslims.


The system also bans the earning of interest.
