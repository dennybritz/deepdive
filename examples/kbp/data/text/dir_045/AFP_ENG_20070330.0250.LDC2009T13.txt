Germany will be ready from April 9 to deploy Tornado jets to fly
surveillance missions over Taliban positions in Afghanistan, the
defence ministry said on Friday.


"We will start moving our aircraft from April 2 and will have
them at NATO's disposal from April 9," defence ministry spokesman
Thomas Raabe told a press briefing.


Germany agreed to send six Tornado fighter jets to Afghanistan to
fly reconnaissance missions for NATO after the alliance pressed
its partners to contribute more resources to fight the resurgent
Taliban.


But Berlin declined to deploy troops in southern Afghanistan,
where the Islamist insurgency is at its strongest and they would
be likely to face combat.


Germany has some 2,750 soldiers stationed in the relatively
stable north.
