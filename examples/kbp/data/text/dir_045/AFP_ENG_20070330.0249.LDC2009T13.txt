A Vietnam Airlines plane carrying 70 people skidded off the
runway at Ho Chi Minh City's international airport, the airline
said Friday.


The ATR72-500 aircraft was forced to turn around shortly after
takeoff from Tan Son Nhat International Airport on Thursday when
its pilots discovered a problem with the brakes.


The plane touched down safely at the same airport but then
skidded about 25 metres off the runway, Vietnam Airlines said in
a statement.


None of the 65 passengers and five crew were injured.


"The incident took place at 10:50am (0350 GMT) Thursday,"
spokeman Nguyen Chan said in the statement. "After the plane
landed it ran off the runway."


The plane turned back about 35 minutes after takeoff upon
discovering reduced hydraulic power on its brakes system, he
said.


The plane had been headed for Phu Quoc Island in southern
Vietnam.


Aviation experts were examining the plane of the state-owned
carrier which was made in September 2001 and put into service one
month later.


Vietnam Airlines has apologised for the incident, the latest in a
series in recent weeks involving its planes flying international
and domestic routes.


Several have been forced to make emergency landings as a result
of technical problems.
