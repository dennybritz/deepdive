Economic optimism in Europe improved more than expected in March,
rising to a six-year high, according to a European Commission
survey released on Friday.


The Commission's eurozone economic sentiment indicator rose to
111.2 points in March from 109.7 points in February, beating
private economists' expectations for a more modest increase to
110.0.


The result was the highest level since January 2001, according to
data from the European Union's executive arm.


The outlook also improved across the broader 27-nation EU, where
the indicator rose to 113.8 points from 112.0 points in February.


The brighter outlook was driven by increased optimism in all of
Europe's biggest economies with confidence particularly strong in
Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy.


Optimism was particularly high in the vast services sector with
confidence surging in Britain, Germany, and Italy.


Separately, the commission published a eurozone business climate
indicator for March that showed confidence stable at 1.55 points,
unchanged from February, but well above private economists'
forecasts for 1.48 points.


The Commission said that the survey "points to strong industrial
production growth in the first quarter of 2007."
