Manchester United captain Gary Neville faces a further three
weeks on the sidelines after suffering ankle ligament damage two
weeks ago.


The England full-back had been expected to return in time for the
trip to Portsmouth next weekend, but Sir Alex Ferguson ruled that
out on Friday.


He told Manchester United Radio: "The swelling has only just gone
down on his ankle so the injury was maybe a bit worse than we
thought in terms of the swelling.


"But he's been doing some good work in the gym and I expect him
to be back in the first team in three weeks time."


Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
have however both been declared fit to return against Blackburn
on Saturday.
