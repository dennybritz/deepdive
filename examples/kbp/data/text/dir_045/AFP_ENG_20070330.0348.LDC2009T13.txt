India's central bank on Friday raised its key short-term lending
rate and the amount of cash that commercial banks must hold on
deposit, to suck out liquidity and fight inflation.


The Reserve Bank of India hiked the key short term lending rate,
known as the repo rate, by a quarter of a percentage point to
7.75 percent and boosted the cash reserve ratio by half a
percentage point to 6.5 percent in a bid to take money out of the
banking system.


"In view of current monetary and anticipated liquidity
conditions, it is critical to take determined action on an
immediate basis," the bank said, noting inflation was running at
6.5 percent for the third week in a row.
