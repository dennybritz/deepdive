American Ian Crocker expects he will have to break his world
record to end phenomenal teammate Michael Phelps' quest for eight
gold medals at the world championships.


Crocker convincingly won their semi-final here Friday in 51.41
seconds, just over a second outside his world record, with Phelps
the fourth-fastest overall in 51.92.


Phelps has dominated the world championships with five gold
medals and four world records, one of them in the 4x200m
freestyle relay Friday, but he must reverse his two losing world
100-metres butterly finals to Crocker to continue his assault on
history.


Three-time world record holder Crocker showed he will again be
tough to toss in his pet event, taking the top seeding into
Saturday's final.


"It is going to be an exciting final," Crocker said. "Michael is
having a great meet and I just can't wait to get out of the box.


"It is an interesting place to be in, the one to try to stop the
giants.


"When it comes to Michael and I, and some of the strong guys
coming through in the event, the (world) record is going to
move."


Crocker said he would not be considered the "bad guy" if he went
on to beat Phelps in the final and denied him the chance of gold
medal history.


"I think all Americans think winning for the United States is the
most important thing. I wouldn't call myself the bad guy," he
said.


"Having him behind me is not the most comfortable position to be
in, but it brings out the best in me."
