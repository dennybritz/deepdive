France rugby union coach Bernard Laporte said Friday he was
counting on Sylvain Marconnet being fit to be named in his World
Cup squad on June 14.


France's most capped prop is recovering after undergoing surgery
this month on a spiral fracture of his left tibia.


The 31-year-old 71-times capped Stade Francais star fractured his
tibia while on a family skiing holiday in the middle of the Six
Nations tournament.


"I saw him this week, he's in good form," said Laporte.


"He feels that it's progressing well. We believe he has the
determination so in our heads we're counting him in. We'll see on
June 14."


According to Stade Francais' doctor, Alexis Savigny, Marconnet
could be able to jog in four months and start playing again in
five, though, only if everything 'goes well'.


The World Cup - which is being hosted by France - begins on
September 7 and runs to October 20.
