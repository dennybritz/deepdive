The 15 British detainees in Iran have been "sacrificed" to the
policies of Britain and the United States, according to a new
letter realesed Friday and attributed to the sole female captive.


The new letter, released by Iranian authorities in London, also
calls for British troops to withdraw from Iraq. British
authorities have denounced Iran's use of the detainees for
propaganda purposes.
