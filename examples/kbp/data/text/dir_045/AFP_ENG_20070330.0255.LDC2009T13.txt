Britain branded as "outrageous" propaganda the broadcast Friday
of new video footage of its naval personnel detained in Iran.


"Using our military personnel for purposes of propaganda like
this is outrageous," said a Foreign Office spokesman, after the
new video in which Iran said another of the sailors had confessed
to illegally entering Iranian waters.


In the video, broadcast by Arabic-language Al-Alam television, a
British sailor identified as Nathan Thomas Summers is cited as
saying: "I deeply apologise for entering your waters."


Earlier British finance minister Gordon Brown, on a visit to
British troops in Afghanistan, condemned the treatment of Faye
Turney, the only woman among 15 sailors and marines detained at
gunpoint in the northern Gulf on March 23.


"The UN resolution is calling definitively for their release.
That's the unanimous view of the international community," he
said. "The treatment of Faye Turney is cruel, callous, inhuman
and unacceptable."


Major British television stations relayed the Iranian television
footage of an interview with one of the sailors.


Britain insists the sailors were on United Nations duty in Iraqi
waters when they were seized, while Iran says they were within
its territorial waters.
