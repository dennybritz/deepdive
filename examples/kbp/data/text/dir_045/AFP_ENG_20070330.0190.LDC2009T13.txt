Ferrari's Felipe Massa on Friday said he was expecting a tough
battle at next weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix as he bids to win
constructors' points against major rivals McLaren and BMW Sauber.


The Brazilian, who finished sixth in the opening race in
Melbourne, replaced team-mate Kimi Raikkonen for Thursday's test
sessions here setting the second- best time of one minute 35.808
seconds over 73 laps in Friday's practice.


Raikkonen won the Australian Grand Prix but McClaren claimed an
early edge in the constructors' race with Fernando Alonso and
Lewis Hamilton finishing second and third.


"It is important to bring home points. And I prefer to start in
the front," Massa told reporters during the the final day of
testing here.


"We are strong. We are fast. But we need to approach every race
in every track differently," he said.


Finland's Heikki Kovalainen on a Renault was fastest of Friday's
10 drivers with a time of 1:35.757 sec.


Rookie Englishman Lewis Hamilton, who drove the fastest lap
Thursday in wet conditions, managed only eighth spot in his
McLaren.


Massa, who started from back in the field in Australia after
mechanical problems in qualifying, said both McLaren and BMW
Sauber were strong teams.


"We saw McLaren were difficult to beat and BMW were also strong
in Melbourne," he said.


Massa said he was happy with his car's performance during the
test here and enjoyed the wide Sepang circuit.


"It is nice to race in Sepang. I like the track but the weather
is a bit hot," he said.


The Malaysian Grand Prix is on April 8 followed by the Bahrain
Grand Prix on April 15.
