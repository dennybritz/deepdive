Wall Street shares drifted higher in opening trade Friday as the
market welcomed stronger-than-expected US economic data and
adjusted portfolios on the final trading day of the first
quarter.


In the first five minutes of trade, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average added 2.40 points (0.02 percent) to 12,351.15 and the
Nasdaq composite increased 2.66 points (0.11 percent) to
2,420.54.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index edged up a
fractional 0.51 points (0.04 percent) to 1,423.04.


The Commerce Department said US consumer spending and personal
income both rose 0.6 percent in February, surprising analysts
expecting hits from slowing economic conditions.


"This was much stronger than expected and gets the first quarter
GDP (gross domestic product) numbers off to a good start," said
Dick Green at Briefing.com.


"It suggests that real GDP growth is on track for the 2.5 percent
growth generally expected. It will allay recession fears. It also
suggests that the problems in the housing sector aren't having
broad impact yet."
