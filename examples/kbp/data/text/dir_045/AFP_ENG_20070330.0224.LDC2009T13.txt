Russian President Vladimir Putin is opposed to any constitutional
change that could allow him to stay in power for a third term, a
Kremlin spokesman said on Friday.


"The president does not believe there is any need or use in
changing the constitution," said the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov,
after a top lawmaker proposed scrapping a two-term limit on
holding the presidency.
