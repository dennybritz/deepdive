German department store operator KarstadtQuelle said Friday that
it had reached an out-of-court settlement with the Jewish Claims
Conference (JCC) in their long-running dispute over real estate
seized by the Nazis in Berlin in the 1930s.


KarstadtQuelle said in a statement that it had agreed to pay
compensation to the heirs of the Jewish Wertheim department store
dynasty with regard to a former property of theirs on the
bustling Potsdamer Platz square in the heart of Berlin, which had
been expropriated by the Nazis.


The JCC is working to recover the assets of the Wertheim family,
many of whose heirs currently live in the United States.


KarstadtQuelle did not reveal in its statement how much it had
agreed to pay in compensation, but JCC put the sum at 88 million
euros (117 million dollars).


The dispute centres on KarstadtQuelle's decision to sell the
property in 2000.


KarstadtQuelle, which gained control of the Wertheim brand in the
early 1950s, sold the property to Otto Beisheim, the founder of
retail and distribution giant Metro for 145 million euros.


But last year, Germany's state asset authority, BARoV, awarded
the properties to the JCC, arguing that KarstadtQuelle was not
the legal owner of the properties when it sold them. And BARoV
approved the JCC's claim for compensation.


KarstadtQuelle had argued that it only gained control of the
Wertheim brand after World War II and could not be held liable
for what happened under the Nazis.
