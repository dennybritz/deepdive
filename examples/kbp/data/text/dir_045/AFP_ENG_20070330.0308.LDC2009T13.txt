Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, beset by a political
crisis at home, is due in Moscow Tuesday to meet his Russian
counterpart Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian foreign minister said.


"The president's visit to the Russian Federation will take place
on April 3," the Interfax news agency quoted Ukrainian Foreign
Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as saying.


The trip, during which Yushchenko is expected to sign a programme
of cooperation between the two countries, follows his threat
Thursday to dissolve parliament and hold early elections.


Tension between pro-Western and pro-Russian political forces has
paralysed political activity in the former Soviet republic.


Relationships between Ukraine and Russia have been strained since
the pro- Western Yushchenko came to power in January 2005 and
were further tested last October after a disagreement over gas
supply prices when Moscow briefly cut off supplies to the
Ukraine.


Putin travelled to Ukraine in December, marking a warming in ties
with Kiev following the creation of a pro-Russian government.
