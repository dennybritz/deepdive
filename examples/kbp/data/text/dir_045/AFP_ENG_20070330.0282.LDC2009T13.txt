Greece on Friday suspended all team sport matches until April 13
in response to a violent clash on the sidelines of a Greek
women's volleyball match that left one fan dead and five others
injured.


"All team sport matches will be suspended for 15 days, namely
until April 13," government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said
after a cabinet meeting here.


The suspension includes the Orthodox Easter weekend on April 8,
during which no matches are held anyway.


The arranged clash on Thursday between around 300 hooligans of
Greek arch-rivals Olympiakos Pireaus and Panathinaikos Athens
escalated into a pitched battle in a rural community outside
Athens, causing widespread outrage in the country.


The police made 13 arrests after the clashes, but are accused by
the media of having failed to act sooner despite having monitored
the hooligans en route to their planned showdown.
