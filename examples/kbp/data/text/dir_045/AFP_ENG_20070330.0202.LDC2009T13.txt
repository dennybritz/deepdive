A diplomatic note from Iran to British authorities condemned the
"illegal act" by British naval staff in the Gulf last week, but
did not call for an apology, according to the text released
Friday.


Iran "protests strongly against this illegal act in violating
Iranian territorial waters (and) underlines the responsibility of
the British government for the consequences," said the note,
released by Iran's embassy.
