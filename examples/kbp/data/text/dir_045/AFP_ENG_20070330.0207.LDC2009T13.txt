New Zealander Mike Sanderson has been appointed sporting director
of the British America's Cup challenge for the next four years.


Team Origin will not compete in this year's competition which
will be held in Valencia, Spain, but is planning for the 33rd and
34th editions likely to be held in 2009 and 2011.


Sanderson, 35, was the winning skipper of the 2005-06 Volvo Ocean
Race and has taken part in several America's Cup challenges, most
recently in 2003 on Oracle BMW.


Team Origin is aiming to make sailing history by becoming the
first British challenger ever to win the America's Cup, the
oldest sporting trophy in the world.


"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I have been exploring
a number of interesting roles since the Volvo Ocean Race, but the
chance to play a part in creating sporting history by leading the
first British team to win the America's Cup is extremely
appealing," said Sanderson.
