Iranian state television broadcast footage on Friday of an
interview with a British sailor saying he and his colleagues had
illegally entering Iranian waters.


Arabic-language Al-Alam television showed an interview with the
sailor in which he said "I deeply apologise for entering your
waters."


"We entered Iranian waters without permission and we were
arrested by coast guards. I would like to apologise to Iranian
people," the official news agency IRNA quoted the sailor
identified as Nathan Thomas Summers as saying.


On Wednesday, the television station had shown footage of the
only woman sailor in the group also saying that they had
trespassed into Iranian waters.


"Everything has been very good since we were arrested and I am
satisfied," IRNA quoted Summers as saying.


"Within the past days Iranian forces have treated us nicely and
very humanely. There has been no mistreatment."
