A Sudanese man tried to hijack a plane flying between Tripoli and
Khartoum on Friday and was arrested after the plane landed in the
Sudanese capital, officials said.


"The hijacker gave himself up after negotiations with the
authorities," an official told AFP on condition of anonymity.


"The hijacker wanted to refuel in Khartoum to travel on to
another country," the official said, without specifying which
country.


A source at Khartoum airport said the hijacker gave himself up
three hours after the plane landed. There was no immediate
information about whether the hijacker had demands or how many
people were on board the hijacked plane.
