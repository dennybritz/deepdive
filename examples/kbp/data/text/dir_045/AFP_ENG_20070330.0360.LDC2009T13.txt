German football legend Franz Beckenbauer will receive the Laureus
Award for Lifetime Achievement in Barcelona on Monday, according
to the organisers of the event.


The 61-year-old Bayern Munich president, who won the World Cup
with Germany both as a player in 1974 and as coach in 1990, will
be presented with the award for his football career and helping
to organise the 2006 World Cup.


Beckenbauer will be the seventh sportsman to receive the award
after Brazilian football legend Pele, Holland's Johan Cruyff,
British rower Steven Redgrave, New Zealand yachtsman Peter Blake,
South African golfer Gary Player and Norwegian mountaineer Arne
Naess.


The prize is a "special honour for prominent sportsmen and
personalities who have substantially made their mark on
international sport," organisers of the Laureus Awards said in a
statement.
