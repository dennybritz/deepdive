At least five Sri Lankan soldiers were killed Friday in a
powerful roadside explosion in the country's north, while eight
civilians died elsewhere in clashes, officials said.


Suspected rebels detonated a Claymore mine as the soldiers were
travelling along the main road near the de factor border with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at Parayanakulam, a
military official said.


The military also reported eight civilians were killed in
shelling in the east of the island, where the two sides have been
locked in long-range attacks.


The defence ministry said the civilians were killed as a result
of firing by Tamil Tiger rebels into populated areas of
Batticaloa district. There was no immediate comment from the
Tigers.


There has been heavy fighting between the two sides in the
coastal Batticaloa region, where the military captured a Tiger
base on Wednesday.


The Tiger rebels are leading a drawn out campaign for
independence. More than 4,000 people have been killed in the
latest wave of fighting since December 2005 despite a truce
arranged by peace broker Norway in 2002.
