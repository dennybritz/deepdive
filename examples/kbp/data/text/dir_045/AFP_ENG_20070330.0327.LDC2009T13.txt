An Austrian court on Friday reversed a decision by the national
football league to deduct 28 points from league side Graz AK.


The court in the southern Styrian town of Graz explained its
decision by saying the sanctions would cause financial losses for
the team, which recently filed for bankruptcy.


Graz AK were relegated to tenth in the Austrian league Monday,
after being slapped with a 22-point penalty, following another
6-point deduction earlier this month.


The points were taken off due to the team's insolvency,
infractions in the procedure to acquire a league licence as well
as failure to follow Bundesliga instructions to compensate a
former player.


The decision by the Graz court puts Graz AK back in eighth place,
ahead of Altach and crosstown rival Sturm Graz, which also
incurred a 10-point penalty for insolvency this week.


The Bundesliga has said it will appeal.


Revised standings after 25 matches:


1. Salzburg 54, 2. Mattersburg 38, 3. Pasching 35, 4. Ried 32, 5.
Rapid Vienna 32, 6. Austria Vienna 31, 7. FC Tyrol 30, 8. Graz AK
27, 9. Altach 27, 10. Sturm Graz 19
