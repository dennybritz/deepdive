Murdered Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer is to be bid a final
farewell at a public memorial service in Cape Town next
Wednesday, organisers said.


The event is to be held at the Wynberg Boy's high school, with
speakers to include former South African cricketer Allan Donald,
and Tim Noakes of the Sport Science Institute of South Africa
with whom Woolmer co-authored a book on the art and science of
cricket.


"The service will be led by Reverend Jerome Francis who was
coached by Bob  from the age of 11," said a statement issued on
behalf of Woolmer's family.


There will be a separate designated area for close friends of the
Woolmer family who live in the Cape Town area.


Woolmer, also a former coach of South Africa, was found strangled
in his Jamaican hotel room on March 18, one day after Pakistan
were dramatically ousted from the cricket World Cup following a
shock defeat to minnows Ireland.


The killing has sparked one of the most complex murder
investigations in Jamaican history and has triggered speculation
about possible links to match- fixing and illegal betting in
cricket.


Around 50 officers are attempting to track down hundreds of
potential witnesses who were either visiting or staying at
Kingston's Pegasus Hotel in the days leading up to Woolmer's
death.
