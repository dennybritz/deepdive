Norway said Friday it would cancel Sierra Leone's debt of 62
million kroner (7.6 million euros, 10 million dollars) and would
also donate an additional 25 million dollars this year to UN
reform.


The cancellation of the Sierra Leone debt is part of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries initiative announced by the Paris Club
earlier this year, the Norwegian foreign ministry said in a
statement.


In a separate statement, the Norwegian government said it had
pledged an additional 25 million dollars this year for the
implementation of UN reform.


Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was one of the co-chairs of a UN
panel that in November recommended reform in the areas of
development, humanitarian assistance and the environment.


According to the foreign ministry, Norway is the seventh-biggest
contributor to the United Nations. The amount of its annual
contribution was not immediately available.
