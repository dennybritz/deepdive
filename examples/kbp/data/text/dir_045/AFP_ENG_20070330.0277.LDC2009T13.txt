Britain's Rebecca Romero will battle defending champion Sarah
Hammer for gold in the final of the women's individual pursuit at
the world track cycling championships here Friday.


Romero, who clocked the second best time of the session, will
meet Hammer, from the United States, at 1800 GMT in the 12-lap
race against the clock.


Romero timed 3:31.89 to Hammer's 3:31.35.


Another Briton, Wendy Houvenaghel, will face off against
Australian specialist Katie Mactier for the bronze medal after
they finished fourth and third respectively.


It means British riders are now in contention for two of the four
gold medals being contested on the second day of the competition.


The men's pursuit team cruised into the final and will now meet
Ukraine in the final after the fancied Australians, the defending
champions, Olympic champions and world record holders failed to
make the medal round.


Later Friday the men's keirin and scratch finals will also
feature, and Britain have more medal chances in the former event.


Britain are emerging as the team of the four-day championships,
having grabbed two gold medals and a silver from the four finals
held on the first day of the competition on Thursday.


Victoria Pendleton and Shanaze Reade won gold in the women's
inaugural team sprint, Bradley Wiggins won gold in the men's
pursuit and Craig MacLean, Ross Edgar and Chris Hoy won silver
behind winners France in the men's team sprint.
