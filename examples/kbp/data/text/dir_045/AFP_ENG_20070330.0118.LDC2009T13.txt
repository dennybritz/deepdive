Iranian state television said it will air an interview on Friday
with one of 15 detained British sailors about how they "entered
Iranian waters".


"One of the 15 British sailors will give more information about
how they entered Iranian waters in an interview," Iran's state-
run news channel said.


It said the interview would be shown at 1 pm (0930 GMT).


Iran's Arabic language state television station Al-Alam on
Wednesday broadcast footage of the 15 who were seized a week ago
in Gulf waters, and showed the only woman sailor among them
saying they had trespassed into Iranian waters.


Britain insists that the sailors and marines were conducting
routine anti- smuggling patrols in Iraqi waters and has frozen
most dealings with Iran over the crisis.
