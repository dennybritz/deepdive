Marat Safin, Nikolay Davydenko, Mikhail Youzhny and Igor Andreev
were Friday named by skipper Shamil Tarpishchev for Russia's
Davis Cup quarter-final tie against France here from April 6-8.


Last year France fell to eventual champions Russia in the
quarter-finals for the second successive year.


And Tarpishchev said: "This year we are the favourites unlike our
last year's quarter-final clash."


The tie will take place on clay at the small indoor court of the
Luzhniki Sport Arena in Moscow.


"We're practicing for three days only and I'm seriously worried
how my players will adjust to the clay courts here after playing
at the hardcourts in North America," explained Tarpishchev.


"We'll need to stay focused. They (France) have nothing to lose,
while we are defending our title. And this fact puts us under
tough pressure."


Russia stand 4-2 in previous meetings with the French.
