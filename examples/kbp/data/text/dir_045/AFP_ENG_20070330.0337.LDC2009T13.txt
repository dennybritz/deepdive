The 15 British detainees in Iran have been "sacrificed" to the
policies of Britain and the United States, according to a new
letter realesed Friday and attributed to the sole female captive.


The letter, released by Iranian authorities in London, also calls
for British troops to withdraw from Iraq. British authorities
have denounced Iran's use of the detainees for propaganda
purposes.


"I am writing to you as a British service person who has been
sent to Iraq, sacrificed, due to the intervening policies of the
Bush and Blair governments," writes Faye Turney, in the letter
addressed "To British people (sic)."


"I believe that for our countries to move forward we need to
start withdrawing our forces from Iraq and leave the people of
Iraq to start rebuilding their lives," it said.


The letter was dated on Tuesday, the same as a second letter
which emerged on Thursday, in which she questioned whether
British forces should remain in Iraq.


"It is now time to ask our governments to make a change to its
behaviour towards other people," she concluded.
