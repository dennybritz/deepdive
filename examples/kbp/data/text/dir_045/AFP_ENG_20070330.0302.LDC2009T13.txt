Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said Friday that he had
acknowledged to his fellow African leaders that opposition leader
Morgan Tsvangirai had been assaulted, but said he deserved it.


"Yes, I told them he was beaten but he asked for it," Mugabe told
supporters the day after returning from a regional summit in
Tanzania.


"We got full backing, not even one criticised our actions," the
veteran president continued.


"There is no country in SADC (the Southern African Development
Community) that can stand up and say Zimbabwe has faulted. SADC
does not do that, it is not a court but an organisation of 14
countries that cooperates with each other and supports each
other."


Tsvangirai's arrest and subsequent assault on March 11 while
trying to attend an anti-government rally was widely condemned by
the West but the SADC summit, which was meant to address the
crisis in Zimbabwe, ended up with a statement of "solidarity"
with the 83-year-old Mugabe's government.
