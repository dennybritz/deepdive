Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made a rare acknowledgement of
divisions within his governing ZANU-PF party on Friday, warning
critics to keep their disagreements in-house.


"Whatever the nature of the differences or quarrels we have it is
completely wrong to allow them to get into the public arena
either through publicity or ligitation," Mugabe told the ZANU-PF
central committee at a meeting where he expected to be chosen as
the candidate for the 2008 presidential election.


"Several of us are keeping the hostile press going and sometimes
going through the revelation of information that should be kept
secret. Let us begin to examine our conscience and our
integrity."
