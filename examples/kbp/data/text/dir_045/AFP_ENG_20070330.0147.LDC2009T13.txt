Britain's bid for a third gold medal here on the second day of
the world track cycling championships will continue Friday after
the men's pursuit team cruised into the final.


British quartet Edward Clancy, Thomas Geraint, Paul Manning and
Bradley Wiggins posted the fastest time of the day for the
16-lap, 4000 metre event in 3min 59.579sec.


They will now meet Ukraine in the final after the fancied
Australians, the defending champions, Olympic champions and world
record holders failed to make the medal round.


Australia clocked a time of 4:07.447 to finish in sixth place .


Their setback means New Zealand have been handed a widely
unanticipated chance to race for the bronze medal, against
Denmark.


Britain grabbed two gold medals and a silver from the four events
held on the first day of the competition on Thursday.


Victoria Pendleton and Shanaze Reade won gold in the women's
inaugural team sprint, Wiggins won gold in the men's pursuit and
Craig MacLean, Ross Edgar and Chris Hoy won silver behind winners
France in the men's team sprint.
