The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said Friday that a
disruptive La Nina weather pattern in the Pacific basin was
looming this year but might not take shape for another two to
three months.


La Nina, effectively a drop in sea surface temperatures off the
western coast of South America, can cause havoc with weather
patterns in many parts of the globe.


"There is a definite indication of La Nina, but the timing is not
clear," WMO scientist Rupa Kumar Kolli told journalists


The Geneva-based WMO said in an report that it had started to
detect first signs of a shift in February, with a drop in eastern
Pacific sea temperatures to below normal, although surface winds
were staying the same.


It said the chances of it developing within two to three months
were "weak."


Previous La Nina's have been associated with drier weather in the
southern United States and western Latin America, and above-
average rainfall to Australia and South East Asia.


But there can also be a knock-on much further afield, with an
increase to monsoon rainfall in the Indian subcontinent, and cold
weather in tropical West Africa, Southeast Africa, Japan and the
Korean peninsula.


The shift follows the dissipation of the notorious El Nino, a
warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures that was blamed for a
lengthy drought in Australia, flooding in the Horn of Africa and
Bolivia, and more severe winter monsoons in South Asia for much
of the past year.
