Michelin, the tyre maker, plans to spend 300 million dollars to
expand its tyre production centre in China into the world's
largest tyre manufacturing base, state media said Friday.


The French auto parts giant has signed a memorandum with the
provincial government of Liaoning in northeast China covering new
truck tyre and sedan tyre projects, the Xinhua news agency
reported.


When the two projects are implemented, the company's existing
base in Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning, will become the
world's largest tyre production base, according to Xinhua.


Michelin spokespeople in China declined comment on the report
when contacted by AFP.
