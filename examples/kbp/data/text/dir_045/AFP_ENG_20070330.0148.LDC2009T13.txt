A model Concorde which has become a landmark at London's Heathrow
airport soared into history Friday, as British Airways gave up
the prime advertising spot to a Dubai-based competitor.


Every year some 25 million passengers drive past the famous BA
plane, which has stood on a roundabout at the road gateway to the
airport for the last 16 years.


The scale model will be replaced by a model of a double-decker
Airbus A380 superjumbo flying the colours of Emirates Airways,
after British Airways gave up the 1.5 million pounds (2.9 million
dollars, 2.2 million euros) a year advertising location.


"Concorde will always have a place in the hearts of all aviation
enthusiasts, but it represents the past, while we will be using
this site in a fresh and innovative way," said Emirates official
Vic Sheppard.


Concorde, with its emblematic delta-wings and droopy nose,
carried wealthy and glamourous passengers across the Atlantic at
speeds of up to 1,350 miles per hour (2,173 kilometres per hour)
for 27 years.


But the aircraft, backed by BA and Air France, was retired from
service in 2003, rendered unprofitable after an Air France plane
crashed outside Paris in July 2000, killing all 113 on board.
