US consumer spending and personal income both rose 0.6 percent in
February, the government said Friday, surprising analysts
expecting hits from slowing economic conditions.


The Commerce Department report on income and spending showed both
figures well ahead of the 0.3 percent gains projected by private
economists for each category.


The report also showed inflation as measured by the personal
consumption expenditures price index rose 0.4 percent in
February, bringing the year-over- year increase to 2.3 percent.


Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices
and is considered by the Federal Reserve to be a better barometer
of prices, rose 0.3 percent in the month, the fastest monthly
gain since August.


On a year-on-year basis, core inflation rose 2.4 percent. Core
inflation was last higher in April 1995.


Adjusted for inflation, real spending rose 0.2 percent and real
disposable incomes, which are inflation-adjusted and measure
income after taxes, rose 0.1 percent.


In January, incomes were up 1.0 percent and spending increased
0.5 percent. The reports appeared to suggest the economy, which
relies on consumer spending for two-thirds of economic activity,
is not softening as much as some analysts have predicted.


Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has argued that the weakness in housing
has not yet spilled over to other segments of the economy and
that growth will remain in the "moderate" range.
