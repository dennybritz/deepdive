The United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday adopted a joint
resolution by European and African nations to maintain scrutiny
on human rights abuses in the strife-torn Sudanese region of
Darfur.


The resolution was adopted without a vote, Council president Luis
Alfonso de Alba told the 47-member assembly.
