Iran said on Friday that another British sailor had "confessed"
in an interview to illegally entering Iranian waters, the
official IRNA news agency reported.


"We entered Iranian waters without permission and we were
arrested by coast guards. I would like to apologise to Iranian
people," IRNA quoted a sailor identified as Nathan Thomas Summers
as saying in an interview.


Iranian television had said earlier it would broadcast footage of
the interview with the sailor.
