EU foreign ministers, meeting in Germany, will send a message of
solidarity with Britain over Iran's detention of 15 British naval
personnel, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said
Friday.


"We will send a signal of solidarity on this issue and we will
try to find the language which conveys this," Steinemeier said as
he and his fellow EU foreign ministers gathered for two days of
talks in the northern German town of Bremen.
