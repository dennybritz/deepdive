Inflation in the 13 countries sharing the euro rose to 1.9
percent in March from 1.8 percent in February, the European
Union's Eurostat data agency said Friday in a first estimate.


The increase was spot on private economists' forecasts and was in
line with the European Central Bank's preference for an annual
inflation rate of less than but close to two percent.


Eurozone inflation has been tame since the beginning of the year,
confounding many economists and politicians' expectations for a
surge after Germany raised valued added tax three full percentage
points in January.


Nevertheless, the European Central Bank raised its key interest
rates to a five- and-a-half-year high point of 3.75 percent
earlier this month to keep a lid on inflation in the bloc.


Headline inflation has closely followed the trend on global oil
markets where the price of crude has risen to a six-month high of
69 dollars a barrel as tensions flared between London and Tehran
over 15 naval personnel held by Iran.


Eurostat is due to update its March inflation estimate with more
complete data on April 16.
