Britain branded as "outrageous" propaganda the broadcast Friday
of new video footage of its naval personnel detained in Iran.


"Using our military personnel for purposes of propaganda like
this is outrageous," said a Foreign Office spokesman, after the
new video in which Iran said another of the sailors had confessed
to illegally entering Iranian waters.
