French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said Friday that
all steps must be taken to avoid an escalation between Britain
and Iran over the detention of 15 British sailors.


"We must avert a course towards confrontation, any escalation,"
said Douste- Blazy in an interview to RTL radio.


"The Iranian authorities must simply return to dialogue."


Tehran last week captured and detained 15 British naval personnel
in the Gulf, accusing them of trespassing in its territorial
waters. Britain says they were on a routine patrol of Iraqi
waters.


France is asking for the immediate and unconditional release of
the 15 sailors and called in Iranian Ambassador Ali Ahani on
Thursday to convey its concern over the fate of the sailors and
marines seized a week ago.


Douste-Blazy declined to say whether the European Union would
consider a freeze on contacts with Iran if the standoff was not
quickly resolved.


"We are holding a discussion with our European partners. For the
time being, we are totally in solidarity with the British and
want to meet with the Iranians," said the foreign minister.


"For the time being, there is no freeze," he said.


Britain froze official contacts on Wednesday with Iran as the
dispute over the detainees intensified, with Prime Minister Tony
Blair vowing to "ratchet up" pressure on the Islamic state.


Douste-Blazy said that if the standoff continues, a new meeting
of the UN Security Council will be convened to decide on the next
steps.


The Security Council on Thursday expressed "grave concern" at the
detention of the nval personnnel but declined to back Britain
with a call for their immediate release.
