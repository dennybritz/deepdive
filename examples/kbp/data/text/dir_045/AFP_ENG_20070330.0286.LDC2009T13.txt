A Sudanese man armed with a knife tried to hijack a plane flying
between Tripoli and Khartoum with 284 people on board on Friday
but was arrested after landing in the Sudanese capital, police
said.


"The hijacker, a Sudanese called Sayed Fallun Sayed, 39 ... tried
to divert the plane to South Africa," a police statement said,
adding that the man was armed with a knife.


"The crew behaved in a professional and calm way and took the
necessary security measures, which allowed the plane to land in
Khartoum as scheduled."


"Security forces then managed to overpower the hijacker," it
said, adding that an initial investigation suggested the man "was
suffering psychological problems."


Police said the Sudan Airways Airbus had 273 passengers and 11
crew on board.


A Sudanese official told AFP that the hijacker had wanted to stop
in Khartoum to refuel and had given himself up after three-hours
of negotiations


There was no immediate information on whether the hijacker had
demands beyond wanting to go to South Africa.
