EU regulators took the first step Friday in legal action against
a suspected cartel of bathroom fittings and fixtures makers as
part of a crackdown on illegal combines.


The European Commission said it had sent formal charge-sheets to
the unnamed companies in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy
and the Netherlands, accusing them of "anti-competitive
behaviour" that broke EU rules.


The EU's competition watchdog said that the action followed
surprise inspections in November 2004 to members of the alleged
cartel, which make  ceramic sanitary ware, taps and fittings and
shower enclosures.


If regulators are not satisfied with the answers, they can slap
fines of up to 10 percent of the companies' worldwide annual
revenue.


EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has made a "no-
tolerance" crackdown on cartels a top priority and has lodged
ever-rising record fines against them.


Most recently, the Dutch commissioner imposed the biggest fine
ever in a EU cartel case by bringing an illegal club of lift
makers crashing down in February with a penalty of 992 million
euros (1.3 billion dollars).


Already this month, her team of trustbusters launched legal
action against suspected cartels making professional-quality
videotape and glass makers.


She also told the European Parliament this month that she
expected to break up as many as nine or 10 cartels this year and
set a new record in annual fines handed out to offending firms.
