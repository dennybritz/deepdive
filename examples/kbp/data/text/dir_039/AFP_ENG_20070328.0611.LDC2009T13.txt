Israeli teen Shahar Peer advanced to the semi-finals of the 6.9
million-dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt tournament
here Wednesday with a 6-0, 6-3 victory over Italy's Tathiana
Garbin.


Peer, ranked 16th, will play for a spot in the championship match
against the winner of a later quarter-final between Australian
Open champion Serena Williams and Czech eighth seed Nicole
Vaidisova.


The other semi-final will match world number one Justine Henin of
Belgium and Russia's Anna Chakvetadze.


Peer, 19, took just 80 minutes to dispatch Garbin, winning the
first nine games of the match on the way to her third semi-final
of the year.


Spanish second seed Rafael Nadal and US third seed Andy Roddick
will try to book a date against each other in a men's semi-final
by advancing in later quarter- finals.


Roddick will be tested by Britain's Andy Murray while Nadal faces
Serbian Novak Djokovic.
