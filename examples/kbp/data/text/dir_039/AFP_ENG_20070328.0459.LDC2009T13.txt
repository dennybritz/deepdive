The launch of a Russian-Ukrainian rocket set to carry 14 foreign
satellites has been delayed until April, Russian officials said
Wednesday


It is the second time the launch has been delayed. The Dnepr
rocket was first due to launch Tuesday from a space centre in
Kazakhstan before being pushed back to Wednesday because of
technical concerns.


Officials encountered problems with the rocket booster and the
launch will now take place April 17, said Igor Panarine,
spokesman for Russian space agency Roskosmos.


It is to carry seven American and six Saudi Arabian satellites,
as well as one Egyptian.


The launch follows an accident that occurred in July 2006
following a Dnepr launch. The rocket crashed to the ground
shortly after takeoff about 150 kilometers (94 miles) southwest
of the Kazakhstan space centre in Baikonur.


It was carrying 18 satellites, including Belarus' first space
device and Italian and American nanosatellites.


Russia was forced to pay one million dollars (748,000 euros) to
Kazakhstan to compensate for ecological damage from the accident,
Ria Novosti news agency reported.
