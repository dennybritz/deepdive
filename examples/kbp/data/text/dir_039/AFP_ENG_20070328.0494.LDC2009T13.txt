Motor sport's world governing body, FIA, on Wednesday cut in half
the five- million-dollar fine imposed on the organisers of the
Turkish Grand Prix over last year's podium controversy.


"We had lodged an appeal for the fine to be reduced, and as a
result half of the fine has been cancelled, " Mumtaz Tahincioglu,
the Turkish Automobile Sports Federation (TOSFED), told the
Anatolia news agency.


The organisers had already paid the remaining half of the fine.


The dispute with FIA erupted after Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet
Ali Talat made the trophy presentation at the August 2006 Formula
One race in Istanbul, drawing angry protests from Greek Cypriots.


Talat is the president of the breakaway Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is recognized only by Ankara. The
Greek Cypriot government in the south is internationally
recognized as the administration of the whole island, divided
along ethnic lines since 1974.


FIA had ruled that the organisers had broken Formula One rules
for politicising the event by allowing the leader of an
unrecognised country to preside over the ceremony.
