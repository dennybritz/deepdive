Israeli shelling of the Gaza Strip wounded four Palestinians on
Wednesday, Palestinian witnesses and medics said, in the first
military action against militants there since a November truce.


The artillery fire struck the northern town of Beit Lahiya.


An Israeli army spokeswoman said it had targeted three militants
preparing to fire a rocket.


"The army identified three militants with rocket launchers
preparing to fire rockets, and opened fire," she said, adding
that eight rockets fired from Gaza had hit Israel on Wednesday.


It was the first time that the Israeli military had retaliated
against Gaza militants since a truce came into effect on November
26, the army said.


A senior security source told AFP that the incident was "part of
an approved government policy against Qassam rocket launchers. We
will take the necessary steps against the launching cells in
order to protect Israeli citizens."


On January 30, Israel carried out an air strike against a tunnel
near the Karni border crossing but there were no casualties.


Army chief Major General Gabi Ashkenazi was quoted as saying on
Wedneseday that the military was having to confront a
strengthening of Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip.
