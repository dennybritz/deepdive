A new suspected case of madcow disease was detected in central
Slovenia during regular testing on a seven-year-old cow
slaughtered earlier this week, veterinary authorities said
Wednesday.


"The National Veterinary Institute will carry out additional
tests and results are expected in a week's time," the institute
said in a statement.


The affected cow was born and bred in a small farm near the town
of Celje, 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Ljubljana.


The farm, which owns five other cows, has been isolated until
final test results are known.


If confirmed, this would be the seventh case of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in a Slovenian-born cow.


The country's first case of BSE was detected in 2001.
