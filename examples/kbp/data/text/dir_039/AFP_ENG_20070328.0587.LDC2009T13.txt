Thousands of students on Wednesday protested a government reform
plan for universities that would limit the power of student
unions.


The plan recently adopted by the parliament would tighten the
academic and fiscal management of public universities, while
limiting the involvement of student unions. Students are also
against a plan that is yet to be finalised that would create
private universities.


The first protests against the changes began in January, but the
movement showed signs of running out of steam.


Many universities have been occupied by students, particulary in
Athens. But the main Greece university teachers union decided
last week to end its strike.


However, that same union, along with a union for secondary school
teachers, called for a 24-hour strike on Wednesday.


A government workers union did the same in support of students,
but also to push for raises.


The civil aviation union decided on a four-hour work stoppage,
which disrupted several domestic flights for Olympic and Aegean
airlines.
