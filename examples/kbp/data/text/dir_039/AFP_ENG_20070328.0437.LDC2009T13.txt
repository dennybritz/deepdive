NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer on Wednesday joined
a growing chorus of calls for the immediate release of 15 British
sailors seized by Iranian forces last week.


"The secretary general joins the calls for the immediate release
of the UK Royal Marines," NATO spokesman James Appathurai told
reporters at a routine meeting in Brussels.


"The situation has been discussed within the North Atlantic
Council (of the 26 member countries) more than once," he said,
adding that the council had been briefed on developments by the
British ambassador.


Earlier on Wednesday, Britain froze official contacts with Iran
as the dispute over the detained sailors intensified, with Prime
Minister Tony Blair vowing to "ratchet up" pressure on the
Islamic republic.


Iran claims they had entered its waters illegally -- Britain says
the sailors were in Iraqi territory -- and has defied mounting
pressure to free the whole group but has said it will release the
only woman among them.
