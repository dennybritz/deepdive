The only member of the new Palestinian unity government to visit
Ottawa since the Canadian government cut aid and diplomatic ties
last year was shunned by government officials Wednesday.


Information Minister Mustapha Barghouti planned to meet with
members of Canada's three opposition parties.


But requests for talks with representatives of Prime Minister
Stephen Harper's Conservative government went unanswered, he told
reporters outside Parliament.


"No. We're not meeting with (Barghouti) today," Andre Lemay, a
spokesman for Foreign Minister Peter Mackay, later told AFP.
"And, our policy towards the Palestinian government has not
changed."


The new Palestinian unity government includes Hamas, regarded as
a terror group by Canada, and the Fatah movement of president
Mahmud Abbas. Barghouti described it as "the most representative
government in the Arab world."


He said he hoped its formation would "end the siege on the
Palestinian people" and open the door to "normal and very good
relations with Canada."


Canada was the first country to suspend aid to a Hamas-led
Palestinian government in March 2006, even ahead of the United
States.


Israel meanwhile has called on the international community to
continue its year- long boycott of the Palestinian Authority.


It insists the new government has failed to recognize the Jewish
state, renounce violence or abide by past peace deals, the three
conditions laid down by the international community to accept and
resume aid to the cash-strapped government.
