Iran on Wednesday played down Britain's decision to freeze
contacts with Tehran over the detention of its 15 naval
personnel, saying ties were already "cold and inactive."


"Ties between Tehran and London are already cold and inactive,
and Margaret Beckett's comments contain nothing new," the
official news agency IRNA quoted a foreign ministry source as
saying.


Earlier the British foreign secretary announced a freeze between
the British and Iranian governments except for contacts to
resolve the standoff that began on Friday with Iran's seizure of
15 sailors and marines in the Gulf.


"The two countries' ties have been cold and inactive for a while
because of the British government's unfriendly policies,
especially its attempts to refer Iran's nuclear case to the UN
Security Council," the source said.


Iran is locked in a standoff with the international community
over its controversial nuclear programme, which the West fears
could be diverted towards weapons development.


On Saturday the UN Security Council adopted a resolution co-
sponsored by Britain that imposes new sanctions on Iran for its
continued refusal to suspend uranium enrichment, the process that
makes nuclear fuel as well as the fissile core of an atom bomb.
