Israel gave a guarded welcome on Wednesday to the relaunch by
Arab leaders of a 2002 peace blueprint for the Middle East
conflict, recalling that it contained clauses unacceptable to the
Jewish state.


"We need to take our time studying what has happened at this
summit before taking an official position," an aide of Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert told AFP.


"For the time being, we reaffirm what the prime minister has said
on several occasions -- that there are positive elements in the
Saudi initiative," said the aide, who asked not to be identified.


She stressed, however, that Israel "cannot accept the
implementation of the right of return of Palestinian refugees in
the framework of a peace settlement."


At an annual summit in Riyadh earlier, Arab leaders voted
unanimously to revive the five-year-old peace plan and launch a
diplomatic offensive to resolve the Middle East conflict.


The blueprint offers Israel full normalisation of relations if it
withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the
creation of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian
refugees.
