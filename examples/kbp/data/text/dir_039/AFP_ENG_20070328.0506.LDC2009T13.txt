UEFA on Wednesday largely maintained tough sanctions against
Valencia and Inter Milan players after the two sides appealed a
ruling on their mass brawl in the Champions League tie in Spain
on March 6.


The European governing body's appeals committee modified some of
the players' suspensions but imposed additional probationary
periods in most instances, UEFA spokesman Ron Faulkner said.


Valencia defender David Navarro, who broke the nose of Inter's
Nicolas Burdisso in the punch-up, will be out of the game for six
months and face a further two- month suspended ban for a
probationary period of two years once he returns.


UEFA's disciplinary body had originally imposed a blanket seven-
month ban on Navarro two weeks ago.


Burdisso's original six-match ban was turned into six plus a two-
match ban suspended for two years, UEFA said in a statement.


Sanctions on three other players were modified in a similar
manner while a firm two match ban on Inter's Julio Cruz was
unchanged.


All six players sanctioned also signed a statement admitting
their role in the fighting and apologising.


"We admit the facts and the offences established by the UEFA
disciplinary bodies. In addition, we agree to the sanctions
imposed here above," The players said.


"We deeply regret the serious nature of the incidents and we
present our most sincere apologies," they added.


Fines on both clubs of 250,000 Swiss francs (155,772 euros,
207,223 dollars) were maintained.


UEFA's new president Michel Platini has called for "zero
tolerance" on football violence in recent days.
