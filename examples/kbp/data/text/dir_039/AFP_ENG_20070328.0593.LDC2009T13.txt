South Africa were 46-1 after 10 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights clash against Sri Lanka at Providence here on Wednesday
chasing 210 to win.


Captain Graeme Smith was on 24 with Jacques Kallis on 20.


Opener AB de Villiers was the man out bowled by Chaminda Vaas for
0 in the first over.


Earlier, Charl Langeveldt claimed five wickets as Sri Lanka
limped to 209 all out.


Tillekeratne Dilshan (58) and Russel Arnold (50) were mainly
responsible for Sri Lanka's total, putting on 97 for the sixth
wicket after their side slumped to 98 for five.


South Africa, needing a win to get their campaign back on track
after losing against Australia in St Kitts Saturday, brought in
left-arm spin bowler Robin Peterson in place of batsman Ashwell
Prince.


Seam bowler Farveez Maharoof returned for Sri Lanka in place of
Dilhara Fernando.


Sri Lanka already have two Super Eight points following a win
over fellow group qualifiers Bangladesh.
