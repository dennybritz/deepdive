President Vladimir Putin voiced Russia's opposition to imposing a
resolution on Kosovo against Serbia's will in a phone
conversation with US President George W. Bush on Wednesday, the
Kremlin said.


"On Kosovo the Russian side confirmed its principled position
against imposing on the sides any kinds of scenario -- so that a
solution is worked out that would be acceptable both to Belgrade
and Pristina," the Kremlin said in a statement after the phone
call, which was initiated by the White House.


Russia, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security
Council, has repeatedly objected to a plan for supervised
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo put forward by UN
mediator Martti Ahtisaari.


Moscow has insisted that any solution must be agreeable to Serbia
as well as Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.


Belgrade has rejected independence for Kosovo, calling instead
for more negotiations.


Russia has close ties with Serbia and strongly objected to NATO's
bombing of the then Yugoslavia in 1999 to stop a Serb crackdown
on ethnic Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo.


The United Nations has administered the province since the NATO
bombing helped to drive out Serb forces.


Ahtisaari's plan is to be debated next month by the Security
Council, which must approve Kosovo's future status.


On Tuesday the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement: "The
creation of an independent state of Kosovo will impose severe and
serious complications on the stability of Europe."
