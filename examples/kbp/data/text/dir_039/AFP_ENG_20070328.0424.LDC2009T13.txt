A futuristic glass extension to London's Tate Modern art gallery
has been given the go-ahead, the museum announced Wednesday.


The 215-million-pound (315-million-euro, 398-million-dollar)
project, a complex arrangement of glass boxes stacked in a
pyramid shape, will extend the gallery's space by 60 percent.


The 12-floor structure will be tacked on to the side of the main
building, a brick-built former power station which was
commissioned in 1947.


The local Southwark council, which is in charge of planning,
agreed to give it the green light at a meeting late Tuesday.


Sir Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director, said he was "delighted"
by the decision, which should allow the extension to be completed
by the 2012 London Olympic Games.


But others have been less kind about the extension, which is near
historic buildings such as Saint Paul's Cathedral and Tower
Bridge.


Architectural historian Professor Gavin Stamp, of New York
University in London, told the British capital's Evening Standard
newspaper that the new building was a "gratuitous disfigurement."


The extension is designed by Swiss architects Herzog and de
Meuron.


Tate Modern attracts some four million visitors per year and is
Britain's third most popular tourist attraction.
