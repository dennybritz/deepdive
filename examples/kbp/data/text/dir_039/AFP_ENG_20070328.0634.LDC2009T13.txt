Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas and Prime Pinister Ismail
Haniya met late Wednesday with Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of an Arab summit in Riyadh,
an AFP correspondent reported.


No details were immediately available about the substance of the
talks.


Haniya's Islamist Hamas movement has close ties with Iran, whose
foreign minister was in Riyadh to attend the opening session of
the two-day summit earlier Wednesday.


Hamas recently formed a national unity government with the
secular Fatah party of the US-backed Abbas in an bid to end a
bloody rivalry between the two groups.
