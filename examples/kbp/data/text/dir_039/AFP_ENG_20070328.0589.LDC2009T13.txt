Romanian border police said Wednesday they had dismantled a
prostitution ring with the help of their German counterparts.


Police arrested the alleged ringleader, Marius C. of Romania, in
the southwestern state of Caras-Severin in January, while another
five members were arrested in Germany, border police said.


Romanian police learnt last May of a network recruiting young
women in night clubs in Caras-Severin and promising them jobs
abroad.


The women were then sent to Germany, including Stuttgart and
Ludwigsburg, where they were sold to Turkish nationals for 5,000
euros (6,667 dollars) apiece and forced to work as prositutes.


Alleged ring members are also being charged with money-
laundering, the police said.
