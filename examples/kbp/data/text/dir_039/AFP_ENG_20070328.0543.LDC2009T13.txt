Saudi King Abdullah, a key US ally among Arab states, was wrong
to call US military presence in Iraq an "illegitimate foreign
occupation," the White House said Wednesday.


"The United States is in Iraq at the request of the Iraqis and
under a United Nations mandate. Any suggestion to the contrary is
wrong," said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe.


Earlier Wednesday, the Saudi king slammed the "illegitimate
foreign occupation" of Iraq in an opening speech to the annual
Arab summit in Riyadh.


"In beloved Iraq, blood is being shed among brothers in the
shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation and ugly
sectarianism threatens civil war," Abdullah said.
