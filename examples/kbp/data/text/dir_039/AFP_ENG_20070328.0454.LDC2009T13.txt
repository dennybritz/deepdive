Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived Wednesday in Dar es
Salaam for a summit of southern African leaders focused on the
escalating economic and political crisis in his country.


Mugabe was welcomed by Tanzanian Foreign Minister Bernard Membe,
before leaving immediately in a heavily-guarded motorcade, an AFP
correspondent said.
