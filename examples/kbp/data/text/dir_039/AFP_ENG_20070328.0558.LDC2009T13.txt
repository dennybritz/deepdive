Postmen in Vienna are to get police escorts following a series of
recent attacks on the postal workers, the Austrian Post Office
said on Wednesday.


The Post Office didn't say how many of the city's 1400 postal
workers would get the escorts but both police and private
security firms would be involved in the new security measures.


In the latest incident early on Wednesday, a postman was attacked
from behind by two men who knocked him down before stealing money
from his wallet.


This was the fourth such attack this month in Vienna, an
otherwise relatively safe city.


On March 1, another postman was injured after being threatened
with a fake weapon and a female colleague was forced on the same
day to hand over money at knife-point.


A third postmen was robbed and slightly injured by two men on
March 12.
