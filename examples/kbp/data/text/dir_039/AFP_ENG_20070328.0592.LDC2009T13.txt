A judge gave British police another week Wednesday to hold three
men for questioning over allegedly helping four suicide bombers
who killed 52 people in London two years ago, a police spokesman
said.


The three were detained March 22 under the Terrorism Act 2000.
Officials said they were being questioned over allegedly
collaborating with the July 7, 2005 bombers.


They were identified by British reports as Mohammed Shakil, 30,
Sadeer Saleem, 26, and Shipon Ullah, 23.


Under Britain's anti-terrorism laws, they can be detained for up
to 28 days subject to regular court approval, but police have to
make periodic requests to a judge for more time to question them.


These were the first major arrests since the 2005 suicide
bombings, in which near-simultaneous blasts caused devastation on
the London transport system during the morning rush-hour.


The four suicide bombers -- three of them Britons of Pakistani
origin and one a naturalised Jamaican -- all died when they set
off rucksack bombs on three London Underground trains and a
double-decker bus.
