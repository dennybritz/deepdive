A revolver once owned by Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond
books, was sold for 12,000 pounds (17,650 euros, 23,550 dollars)
at an auction in London on Wednesday.


The Colt Python .357 Magnum was presented to Fleming by the Colt
Company as a gift in 1964, possibly as thanks for having his
character Scaramanga, the KGB- trained villain in "The Man With
The Golden Gun", use a Colt gun.


The snub-nosed revolver, which is in excellent condition, is
engraved with the legend: "Presented To Ian Fleming By Colt's
Patent Fire Arms Mfg. Co".


It had been expected to fetch between 10,000 and 15,000 pounds
and was bought anonymously over the telephone during a sale at
auction house Bonhams.


Fleming was a journalist and banker before working in Naval
Intelligence during World War II, where he rose to the rank of
Commander Fleming and was right-hand man to spymaster Admiral
John Godfrey.


After the war, he went to Jamaica for a naval conference and fell
in love with the island, where he wrote the Bond novels at his
home, "Goldeneye".


Bond, the suave super-spy created by Fleming, carried a Walther
PPK pistol which is easily concealed under a dinner jacket
because it is small and light.
