Israel's most notorious underworld "godfather" was flown back to
the country on Wednesday from the United States to finish a jail
term for drug trafficking, police said.


Zeev Rosenstein was sentenced in Miami in January to 12 years
behind bars after pleading guilty to drug trafficking following
his extradition from Israel a year ago for importing 700,000
ecstasy tablets to the United States and Europe.


Rosenstein, 55, owns a number of casinos abroad and has escaped
at least six attempts on his life, including a bomb attack which
killed three people and wounded 30 more in Tel Aviv in December
2003.


His transfer to an Israeli jail took place amid tight security
over fears that other underworld figures might try to kill him.
