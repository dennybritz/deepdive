US President George W. Bush fully backs British Prime Minister
Tony Blair over the crisis with Iran which seized 15 British
naval personnel a week ago, the White House said Wednesday.


Bush held a telephone conference with Blair on Wednesday at which
he said he "fully backs" the British leader in the affair, White
House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.


Britain on Wednesday froze official contacts with Iran in the
escalating dispute as Tehran said it would soon release the only
woman among the group, which it has maintained was captured after
entering Iranian waters.
