Israeli shelling of the Gaza Strip wounded four Palestinians on
Wednesday, Palestinian witnesses and medics said, in the first
military action against Gaza militants since a November truce.


The artillery fire struck the northern town of Beit Lahiya.


An Israeli army spokeswoman said it had targeted three militants
preparing to fire a rocket.


"The army identified three militants with rocket launchers
preparing to fire rockets, and opened fire," she said, adding
that eight rockets fired from Gaza had hit Israel on Wednesday.


It was the first time that the Israeli military had retaliated
against Gaza militants since a truce came into effect on November
26.


On January 30, Israel carried out an air strike against a tunnel
near the Karni border crossing but there were no casualties.
