Spanish police say they have arrested seven suspected ETA members
Wednesday after a series of major raids in the north of the
country against the militant Basque separatist group.


Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said it had been a
major operation.


The Basque news agency Vasco Press and private radio station
Cadena Ser said five men and two women were picked up by police
in the operation.


They said the raids were aimed at breaking up a new 'Donosti
Commando', the lethal ETA unit which was dismantled in 2005.


Citing "anti-terrorist sources", Cadena Ser said the operation
was unrelated to ETA's lethal bombing of Madrid airport in
December.


But investigators had not ruled out the possibility that some
suspects were planning an attack, it added.


Vasco Press named one of those arrested as Jose Angel Lerin
Sanchez, 36, a former member of Basque nationalist youth group
Jarrai.


Lerin Sanchez has been on the run since 2005 and has previously
been convicted for attacking a police officer.


A suspected ETA member, he was being held by police in the Basque
region of Guipuzcoa, northern Spain, the news agency said.


Askatasuna, a support group for Basque prisoners, said six people
had been held for questioning. One of them, Juan Carlos Herrador
Pousal, 39, was stopped by eight police officers in a bar in San
Sebastian.


According to Vasco Press, another person was held in Idiazabal in
the Basque country and another at Etxarri Aranaz in Navarre.
