Romania still has some way to go to make the reforms required by
the European Commission, according to a report due to be
delivered to Brussels, a government source said Wednesday.


The document, by the Department for European Affairs (DAE), is
due to be delivered to the European Commission by the end of the
month -- three months after Romania joined the European Union.


It says that while reforms have been made in the field of justice
and anti- corruption, "sensitive points" remain.


The Commission required Romania to improve the transparency of
its justice system and to strengthen its anti-corruption
measures.


The DAE report said it had made progress harmonising the legal
system and strengthening the courts by training judges and
prosecutors.


Some 200 people were charged in major corruption cases between
September 1 and March 15, it added.


But there had been delays to the adoption of a draft law to
create a national anti-corruption agency, which could check the
provenance of MPs', magistrates' and politicians' assets.


"We are awaiting from parliament a final version that is as close
as possible to the one proposed by the government," the DAE said.


Several political parties have opposed the creation of the
agency.


But on a visit to Bucharest earlier this month, European Justice
Commissioner Franco Frattini, called for a text that did not
dilute the future agency's functions.


Brussels is to present a progress report on Romania's justice
reforms by July and could still impose sanctions if it decides
the country has not made enough progress in its reforms.


Romania was able to join the EU at the beginning of January
despite its marginal fulfillment of some adhesion criteria.
