Iran said on Wednesday 15 British sailors were "definitely"
arrested in its territorial waters, the official IRNA news agency
reported.


"The first stage of technical investigations into the location of
the British forces' arrest has ended and it shows the forces were
definitely arrested in Iran's territorial waters," IRNA quoted a
foreign ministry source as saying.


"This can be technically proven and the British officials have
been informed.


"Some of the detained British forces have admitted they were in
Iranian territorial waters at the time of the arrest and
expressed regret," the unnamed source said.
