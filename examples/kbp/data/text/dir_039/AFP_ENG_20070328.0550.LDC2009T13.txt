Ugandan troops killed 38 members of a rebel group in a gun battle
near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, an army
spokesman said Wednesday.


"We tracked a group of about 40 to 60 fighters and engaged them
along River Sempaya in Semliki Game Reserve," near the border
with DRC, Lieutenant Kiconco Tabaro, army spokesman for western
Uganda, told AFP by telephone.


He said 34 rebels, from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), were
killed during a gun battle on Tuesday and four others were killed
a day earlier in the western Bundibugyo district.


"We expect the number of casualties to go up," he said, adding
that the army was still hunting for more rebels, suspected to be
in hiding.


The army suspected the rebels had entered Uganda from the DRC on
Sunday, he added.


The ADF, a mix of Islamist and secular guerrillas, has been
fighting the government since 1996. It has been blamed for
bombings and massacres in the late 1990s.


The army claims that the rebels are regrouping in the DRC.
