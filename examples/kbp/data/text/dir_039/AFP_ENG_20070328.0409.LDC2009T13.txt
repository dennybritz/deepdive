President Vladimir Putin voiced Russia's opposition to imposing a
resolution on Kosovo against Serbia's will in a phone
conversation with US President George W. Bush on Wednesday, the
Kremlin said.


"On Kosovo the Russian side confirmed its principled position
against imposing on the sides any kinds of scenario -- so that a
solution is worked out that would be acceptable both to Belgrade
and Pristina," the Kremlin said in a statement.
