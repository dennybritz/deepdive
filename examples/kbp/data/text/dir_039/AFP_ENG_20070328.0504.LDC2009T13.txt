Air Senegal ground personnel and flight attendants returned to
work Wednesday following a two-day strike for higher salaries
that brought flights to a halt, company and union officials said.


"The strike order has been lifted," union leader Moustapha
Diakhate told Walfadjri private radio. "We have signed an
agreement protocol with the Senegal government -- the same one
that the CEO of Air Senegal International had refused to sign."


No details of the agreement were given.


Senegal Prime Minister Macky Sall said following a meeting with
workers' representatives that the government had taken over
negotiations.


Royal Air Maroc owns a 51 per cent share in Air Senegal, while
the Senegalese government owns 49 per cent.


Sall said the strike had led to daily losses of 200 million FCFA
(305,000 euros, 407,000 dollars). He called for an end to the
strike to avoid putting the company's finances in difficulties.


"We have resumed and all flights have returned to their usual
schedule," said airline spokesman Matar Diop.


Besides increased pay, workers were also seeking to have about a
hundred interim staff members made regular. Pilots did not
participate in the strike.
