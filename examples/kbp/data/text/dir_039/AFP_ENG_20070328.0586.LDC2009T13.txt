Three Estonian political parties agreed Wednesday after three
weeks of negotiations to set up a coalition to rule the Baltic
state, officials said.


The right of centre Reform Party of outgoing Prime Minister
Andrus Ansip; Pro Patria-Res Publica, of the same political
leaning; and the left-wing Social- Democratic Party initialled a
coalition agreement.


"The agreement will be formally signed on Monday, when the new
parliament convenes," Ansip told reporters.


Before that first session of the new parliament since the March 4
elections, in which Ansip's party did best, President Toomas
Hendrik Ilves is expected to nominate Ansip for prime minister.


The candidate for prime minister has two weeks after his
nomination to present his government's programme to parliament,
and must then receive the  backing of a simple majority in
parliament to be confirmed as head of government.


The probable coalition would have a comfortable 60-vote majority
in the 100-seat single chamber parliament.
