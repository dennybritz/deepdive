A member of the Black Eyed Peas hip-hop group was arrested on
suspicion of driving under the influence and drug possession, Los
Angeles County police said Wednesday.


Jaime Luis Gomez, 31, also known as "Taboo," was arrested early
Tuesday after a fender-bender in Industry, 30 kilometers (20
miles) outside Los Angeles, said Los Angeles Sheriff's Sergeant
Kevin Walk.


Police said Gomez had been drinking and had in his car marijuana
and doctor- prescribed drugs for which he had no prescription.


A date to appear in court has not been set.


The group was formed in 1995 and has since won three Grammy
Awards, but they met little success until 2003 with the addition
of singer Stacy Ferguson, "Fergie."


Their latest albums "Elephunk" and "Monkey Business" have sold
more than 16 million copies.
