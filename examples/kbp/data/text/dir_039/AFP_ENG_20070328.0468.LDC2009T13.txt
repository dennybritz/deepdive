The Bahraini president of the UN General Assembly became the
first woman to address an Arab summit on Wednesday as she took
the podium at the opening session in Riyadh.


Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa was the first woman to address an annual
summit of the 22-member Arab League since the bloc was formed in
1945.


She did so in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia, where the sexes
are generally segregated in public and a strict dress code
normally requires women to cover themselves from head to toe.


But Khalifa addressed the gathering dressed in a blue suit with a
loose headscarf.


The 53-year-old was one of the first women to practise law in
Bahrain, where she defended women before Islamic sharia courts.
