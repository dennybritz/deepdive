Brazil's economy expanded 3.7 percent in 2006, based on a new
method of calculation, the national statistics agency said
Wednesday.


The new calculation used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics (IBGE) revised up the earlier estimate for 2006
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.9 percent.


The agency last week said the new method prompted an upward
revision of 2005 GDP to 2.9 percent instead of 2.3 percent.


Even with the upward revisions, Brazil has been growing at a
slower pace than most other emerging market economies.


But the central bank said in a separate report it was upgrading
its outlook for 2007 economic growth to 4.1 percent from 3.8
percent. The report projected inflation for the year at 3.8
percent instead of 3.9 percent.


The latest data  from BGE showed growth of 0.9 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2006, down slightly from an earlier estimate of
1.1 percent.


Growth was fueled largely by domestic demand, including consumer
spending and business investment, while a rise in exports was
largely offset by increased imports.


Household spending was up 4.3 percent as incomes grew 5.6
percent.
