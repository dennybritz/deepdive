San Francisco is to become the first US city to ban plastic
supermarket bags in a bid to help save the environment, city
officials said Wednesday.


Lawmakers in the northern Californian city of around 800,000
people passed a bill late Tuesday preventing larger supermarkets
and drugstores from offering shoppers plastic bags.


Mayor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign the bill into law.


If signed, supermarkets will have six months and pharmacies one
year to switch over to environmentally friendly compostable bags,
made of corn starch or of recycled paper.


Environmental groups say around 180 million plastic bags are
distributed in San Francisco each year. The plastic sacks are
often blamed for polluting waterways and killing marine life.
