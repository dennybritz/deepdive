Australia skipper Ricky Ponting said the world champions are
approaching their best form after demolishing the West Indies by
103 runs in their opening World Cup Super Eights match on
Wednesday.


Australia bowled out the hosts for 219 in the 46th over after the
two-time defending champions had piled up 322 in their innings on
Tuesday before rain caused the game to be held over.


Opener Matthew Hayden scored 158 to register his second
successive century after his World Cup record 66-ball ton against
South African in St Kitts on Saturday.


"We are playing pretty close to our optimum," said Ponting whose
team have now scored 300 or over in all of their four innings at
the World Cup.


"Our batting has been very good ever since we got here and to get
322 on that wicket on Tuesday was a very good effort.


"Matthew Hayden was the catalyst but the other batters did well
and our new ball bowling today was very good."


West Indies skipper Brian Lara top-scored with 77 as the hosts
replied with Denesh Ramdin hitting 52 at the new Sir Vivian
Richards Ground.


But they were always struggling to keep up with the asking rate
after slipping to 107-5 at one stage.


"Australia showed why they are the best side in the world,"
admitted Lara.


"They outplayed us over the two days. They deserve
congratulations for a very good performance."
