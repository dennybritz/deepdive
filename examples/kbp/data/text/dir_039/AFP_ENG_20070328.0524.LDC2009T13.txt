A British woman among 15 navy staff detained by Iran said they
had "apparently" entered Iranian waters, according to a letter
released Wednesday by Tehran's embassy here, cited by British
media.


"We were out in the boat when we were arrested by Iranian forces
as we had apparently gone into Iranian waters," she said,
according to the letter, broadcast by British television
channels.


"I have written a letter to the Iranian people to apologise for
us entering into their waters," she added.


The authenticity of the letter could not immediately be verified.


She added that she was "well and safe," adding that, "the people
are friendly and hospitable," and that she was fed three meals a
day and given plenty of fluids.


And she concluded: "Please don't worry about me. I'm staying
strong. Hopefully it won't be long until I'm home to get ready
for Molly's birthday party" -- referring to her three-year-old
daughter.
