The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
(ICTY) on Wednesday upheld a landmark decision to transfer one of
its cases to Serbia for the first time.


The UN court rejected an appeal against November's ruling that
Vladimir Kovacevic, an army commander accused of directing the
December 1991 shelling of Dubrovnik, in Croatia, should be tried
in Serbia.


"This is the first case referred by the tribunal to Serbia," the
ICTY said in a statement Wednesday.


The tribunal, based in the Hague, can refer lesser cases to the
countries of the former Yugoslavia. It has so far referred nine
suspects to Bosnia and Herzegovina and two to Croatia.


Kovacevic, known as "Rambo", is charged with six counts of war
crimes for his part in the shelling of the old town of Dubrovnik,
which killed two civilians and injured three others. The city is
a Unesco world heritage site.


The 46-year-old was arrested in Belgrade in October 2003 and a
month later transferred to a UN detention centre in the Hague.


His trial was delayed over concerns about his mental health. In
April 2006, the tribunal found him unfit to stand trial.


In November, the ICTY said the Serbian authorities could monitor
Kovacevic's health and should be responsible for resuming
proceedings against him should be become fit.
