The most high-profile armed group in Nigeria's volatile oil-rich
south Wednesday poured scorn on President Olusegun Obasanjo's
offer of an amnesty to militant youths in the region who renounce
violence.


The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said
Obasanjo, rather than the militants, is the one that needs to be
amnestied.


"Obasanjo has still not appreciated the gravity of the situation
he is faced with. It is he who should be pleading for amnesty for
all the evil he committed while in office," a MEND spokesman said
in an email.


"There will be genuine amnesty for those who turn (over a) new
leaf and hand over their weapons," Obasanjo said Tuesday in
Abuja, adding: "but I will not give amnesty to somebody who will
point a gun at the head of somebody."


The MEND spokesman reiterated his group's warning of preparing
for "war" against the Nigerian security forces.


"It is common knowledge to Boladei Igali (Obasanjo's advisor on
Niger Delta) and the Bayelsa State government that new camps are
being opened as we are acquiring more and better weapons," he
said in the email.


"We will respond in kind to these hollow words (of Obasanjo) in
days to come. We will show the Nigerian government what we think
of this offer," he added.


Since the start of last year well over 100 foreigners have been
kidnapped in the Niger delta. Some 40 Nigerian security officers
have been killed and numerous oil facilities damaged.
