US shares fell heavily Wednesday amid economic concerns after
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress the outlook
for the depressed housing market was "uncertain."


Surging world oil prices also hammered stocks amid geopolitical
concerns related to Iran, and Tehran's holding of 15 British
military personnel.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102.30 points (0.83
percent) at 12,294.99 at the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite finished 20.33 points (0.83 percent) lower
at 2,417.10 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500
dropped 11.74 points (0.82 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,416.87.


"Overall, the economy appears likely to continue to expand at a
moderate pace over the coming quarters," Bernanke told Congress,
adding however, that "the near-term prospects for the housing
market remain uncertain."


His comments spooked investors who were already uneasy about the
slump in the US housing market and rising foreclosures.
