Iranian state television broadcast footage on Wednesday of 15
British sailors and marines captured last week in which one of
them admitted their vessel could have strayed into Iranian
waters.


The footage shown by the television's Arabic-language channel
included pictures of a black headscarfed Faye Turney, 26, the
sole woman among the personnel seized in Gulf waters.


A letter she had written to her family was also shown.


The detainees were pictured having a meal, and Turney, a married
mother of a three-year-old girl, was interviewed.


"Obviously we trespassed in the waters," she said in reference to
Tehran's insistence that the British marines and sailors had
entered Iranian territorial waters.


"They were friendly, very hospitable, very thoughtful. Nice
people," she said of her captors.


"They explained to us why we had been arrested. There was no
agggression, no hurt, no harm. They were very, very
compassionate."


The report did not say when or where the footage was filmed.


Britain swiftly condemned Iran's decision to parade the captives
on television.


"It is completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on
television," a Foreign Office spokesman told AFP.


"There is no doubt that all personnel were seized in Iraqi waters
and were entitled to be there."
