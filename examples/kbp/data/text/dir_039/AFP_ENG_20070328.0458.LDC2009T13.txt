Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf warned Wednesday that rising
tensions in the oil-rich Gulf risk leading to a confrontation
that could affect the entire world.


"Tensions in the Gulf region are shaping an ominous confrontation
that could have incalculable consequences globally, regionally
and among the Muslim umma (faithful)," Musharraf told an Arab
summit in Riyadh in a reference to Iran's standoff with the West
over its controversial nuclear programme.


"We cannot remain helpless spectators in this and other crises
and conflicts afflicting the Islamic world," said Musharraf, one
of several world figures invited to the summit's opening session.


"We need to join hands to work for solutions on the basis of
fairness, justice and realism."


Musharraf warned against the rise of extremism and sectarianism
in the Islamic world.


"Apart from disputes and conflicts, Muslim countries are facing
great danger in the rise of extremist and obscurantist thinking
and tendencies," he said.


"Sectarian and ethnic divisions are tearing the fabric of many of
our societies and draining energies needed to ensure progress and
development."
