Iran on Wednesday played down Britain's decision to freeze
contacts with Tehran over the detention of its 15 naval
personnel, saying ties were already "cold and inactive."


"Ties between Tehran and London are already cold and inactive,
and Margaret Beckett's comments contain nothing new," the
official news agency IRNA quoted a foreign ministry source as
saying.
