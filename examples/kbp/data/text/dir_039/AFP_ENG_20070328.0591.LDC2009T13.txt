Two US servicemen and two civilians have been killed in Iraq,
three of them inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone in
separate attacks, US officials said on Wednesday.


One US soldier and a civilian were killed in a rocket attack on
Tuesday in the Green Zone -- seat of the US mission and the Iraqi
government -- while another two US civilians and a soldier were
wounded, US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher
Garver told AFP.


A US contractor died on Tuesday after being wounded a day earlier
by rocket fire near the embassy, US charge d'affaires Daniel
Speckhard said in a separate statement.


A US marine also died on Tuesday after being attacked during
combat operations in the western Sunni province of Anbar, the
military said.


The latest military casualties brought US losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,237, according to AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.
