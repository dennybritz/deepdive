Biarritz centre Rudi Coetzee of South Africa, who hurt his right
arm at the weekend, is out for the rest of the season, the top
French Top 14 rugby club said on Wednesday.


Coetzee, who left the field in the second half of Saturday's
19-19 home draw against Stade Francais, suffered a serious break
of his right forearm requiring an operation on Tuesday.
