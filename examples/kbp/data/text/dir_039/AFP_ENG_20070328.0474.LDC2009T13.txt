German inflation picked up in March to 1.9 percent from 1.6
percent a month earlier, preliminary figures released Wednesday
by the federal statistics office showed.


Analysts polled by the financial news agency AFX News had
forecast a rise of 1.8 percent.


Consumer prices rose by 0.3 percent on a monthly basis, also
slightly above expectations.


But inflation remained below the European Central Bank's medium
range target of 2.0 percent, despite a jump in Value Added Tax in
January from 16 to 19 percent.


The office is to publish definitive figures on April 16.
