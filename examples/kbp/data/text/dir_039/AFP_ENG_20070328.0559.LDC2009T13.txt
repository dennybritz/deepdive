US President George W. Bush fully backs British Prime Minister
Tony Blair over the crisis with Iran which seized 15 British
naval personnel nearly a week ago, the White House said
Wednesday.


Bush held a secured video teleconference with Blair on Wednesday
at which he said he "fully backs" the British leader in the
affair, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.


Britain on Wednesday froze official contacts with Iran in the
escalating dispute as Tehran said it would soon release the only
woman among the group, which it has maintained was captured after
entering Iranian waters.


The two men spoke "on a variety of topics including this one. The
president fully backs Tony Blair and our allies in Britain,"
Perino said, adding the videoconference had been programmed
before the 15 sailors and marines were seized.


Amid mounting tensions, fuelled by US navy exercises in the Gulf,
Blair has vowed to "ratchet up" pressure on the Islamic republic.


Britain has unveiled evidence that it said showed servicewoman
Faye Turney, seven other sailors and seven marines were in Iraqi
waters when detained last Friday.


Iran again rejected this and played down Britain's decision to
freeze contacts with Tehran, saying ties were already "cold and
inactive," the official news agency IRNA quoted a foreign
ministry source as saying.
