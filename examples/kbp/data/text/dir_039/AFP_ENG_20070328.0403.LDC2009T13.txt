Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was driven away by
his staff from the offices of his Movement for Democratic Change
Wednesday after a police raid on the building, an AFP
photogropher said.


The MDC leader made no comment to reporters as he was driven away
from the building several hours after security services had
sealed off the area during the course of their raid.


The MDC's general secretary Tendai Biti had earlier said that
Tsvangirai and around 20 party workers had been detained during
the lunchtime raid on the headquarters in downtown Harare.
