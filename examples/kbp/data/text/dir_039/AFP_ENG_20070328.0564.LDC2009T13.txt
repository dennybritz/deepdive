Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn will have his appeal against a
one-match suspension handed out by FIFA for improper conduct
heard on Monday.


Kahn was fined 10,000 Swiss francs (6,171 euros) and suspended by
UEFA's disciplinary committee for arguing with officials over a
routine doping test and is set to miss the German giants
Champions League quarter-final first leg tie against AC Milan on
Wednesday.


The appeal will be heard at UEFA's head-quarters in Nyon at 9am
on Monday, according to German newspaper Bild in an advancer for
its Thursday edition.


Following Bayern's 2-1 Champions League win over Real Madrid
earlier this month, Kahn argued with the doctor supervising his
doping tests after he was asked to produce a second urine sample,
because the official had not seen the first sample produced.


If Kahn's ban is upheld his 22-year-old under-study, Michael
Rensing, said it would be his dream come true to face the Italian
giants at the San Siro stadium.


"It would be the absolute highlight of my career so far," Rensing
told the Bayern website.


"I've made a few appearances in the Bundesliga and for the
Germany U-21s, but in terms of significance, Milan would be very
special."
