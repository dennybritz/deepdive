Nigerian-born Boston Celtics center Michael Olowokandi will miss
the remainder of the National Basketball Association season with
a broken left foot, the club announced Wednesday.


The seven footer (2.13m) who grew up in England has seen little
action for the Celtics this season, averaging 1.7 points and 2.0
rebounds in only 24 games for a team that has the Eastern
Conference's worst record at 21-49.


Olowokandi, the top overall selection of  the 1998 NBA Draft, has
career averages of 8.3 points and 6.8 rebounds in nine seasons
with the Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles
Clippers.


Olowokandi, who turns 32 on Tuesday, enjoyed his best season in
2002-2003 with 12.3 points and 9.1 rebounds a game for the
Clippers.
