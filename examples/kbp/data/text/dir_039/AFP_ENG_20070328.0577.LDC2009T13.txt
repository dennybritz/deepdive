Britain's Foreign Secretary Margarett Beckett voiced concern
Wednesday at possible "coercion" after video footage showed a
detained sailor admitting entering Iranian waters.


She was speaking after Iranian state television broadcast footage
of 15 British sailors and marines captured last week in which the
sole woman, Faye Turney, was shown saying: "Obviously we
trespassed in the waters."
