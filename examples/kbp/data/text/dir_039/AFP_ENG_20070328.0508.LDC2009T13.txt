Kenya is likely to extend the one-year contract of national coach
Roger Harper when his current deal ends in June, officials said
on Wednesday.


The former West Indies spinner, who took charge of Kenya in
January 2006 with the task of preparing the national side for the
ongoing World Cup in the Caribbean, stayed behind when the team
returned home on Tuesday.


Kenya, semi-finalists in the last tournament in 2003, were
eliminated after losing two Group C matches against New Zealand
and England and registering only one win over Canada in their
opening match.


Cricket Kenya chairman Samir Inamdar said his board would meet to
discuss an extension for Harper, who is on vacation in his native
Guyana, with the aim of taking the team to the Twenty20 World Cup
in South Africa in September.


"The coach has done very well and we are very grateful to him for
having created a unified team," said Inamdar. "The team would
have done better in the West Indies if it were not for some minor
mistakes including giving away easy wickets.


"But we were not humiliated. We will ask Harper about his views
before we make the final decision," Inamdar said.


As well as the coach, the national team players are expected to
be put under formal contracts for the first time in four years
following the arrival of a new sponsor.
