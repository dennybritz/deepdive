The Danish diversified group A.P. Moeller-Maersk, with interests
in shipping, oil and maritime construction, said Wednesday its
net earnings fell sharply in 2006 and predicted lower than
expected results this year.


Net earnings came to 16.2 billion kroner (2.17 billion euros, 2.9
billion dollars) in 2006, down 20 percent from 2005.


It was the third fall in net earnings in three years,
attributable mainly to its container division Maersk Line, which
was hit by falling transport prices.


Overall sales rose 26.8 percent in 2006 to 264.75 billion kroner,
thanks largely to the acquisition of the Dutch company Royal
P&O Nedlloyd.


A.P. Moeller-Maersk said it foresaw net earnings of 17 billion
kroner this year from sales of 280 billion. Analysts had said
they were expecting 19 billion kroners in profit and sales of 295
billion kroner.


The Maersk Line division suffered a pre-tax loss of 3.37 billion
kroner after a profit of 7.65 billion in 2005. Sales came to
150.31 billion kroner from 128.92 billion.


North Sea oil and gas operations showed an after-tax profit of
10.11 billion kroner after 6.98 billion in 2005.


Company head Jess Soederberg said the integration of Royal
P&O Nedlloyd had proved to be costly but he added that he did
not regret the acquisition.


After losing 1.0 percent on the Denmark exchange following news
of the results, shares in A.P. Moeller-Maersk were showing a gain
of 1.55 percent at 58.90 kroner (7.90 euros).
