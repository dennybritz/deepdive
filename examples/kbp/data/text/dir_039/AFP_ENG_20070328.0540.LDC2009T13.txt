Arab leaders meeting in Riyadh decided on Wednesday to issue a
direct call to the Israeli government and people to accept an
Arab peace offer and negotiate, in a resolution unanimously
adopted and seen by AFP.


The Arab League heads of state "reaffirm their call to the
government of Israel and all Israelis to accept the Arab peace
initiative and seize the opportunity to resume the process of
direct and serious negotiations on all tracks," the resolution
says.


A minister said it was adopted in a closed session during the
first day of the annual Arab summit, which is this year being
held in the Saudi capital.


The resolution also mandated a ministerial committee formed when
the peace plan was first adopted at an Arab summit in Beirut in
2002 to set up working teams to undertake contacts with the UN
chief, the UN Security Council, the international Quartet "and
parties concerned with the peace process" to seek a resumption of
negotiations.


The resolutions adopted by the summit are expected to be made
public on Thursday.
