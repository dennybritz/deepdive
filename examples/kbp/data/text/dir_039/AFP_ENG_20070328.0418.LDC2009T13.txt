A sailboat with 103 would-be immigrants from Haiti aboard ran
aground at a beach just north of Miami, the US Coast Guard said
Wednesday. One person died on the beach.


The group arrived aboard a cargo sailboat of between 15 to 20
meters (50-60 feet) long early Wednesday.


Local television broadcast images of the immigrants jumping off
the ship and running towards the beach.


"The Border Patrol has 102 in custody, one was found dead in the
beach," said Coast Guard spokesman Dana Warr.


"We're doing shoreline searches with some aircraft and some
vessels, just to rule out there's some people in the water," Warr
said.


US Customs and Border Protection agents will send the would-be
immigrants back to Haiti, Warr said.


The group of more than 100 was unusually large for Haitian
immigrants.


"The last time a large group of Haitians as this arrived in the
US was in October 2002," he said. "Those were about 230."


Since October the Coast Guard has intercepted 834 Dominicans, 711
Cubans and 272 Haitians at sea attempting to sneak into the
country.
