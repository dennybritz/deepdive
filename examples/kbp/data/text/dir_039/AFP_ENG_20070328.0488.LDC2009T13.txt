Dozens of Israeli peace activists rallied on Wednesday opposite
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office, calling on him to adopt a
peace initiative drawn up by Arab states.


More than 100 protesters brandishing placards reading "Support
the Saudi peace initiative" and flags from Arab states gathered
outside Olmert's office on the day Arab leaders discussed an Arab
peace drive in the Saudi capital.


"We call on the Israeli government to seriously consider and
adopt the Saudi peace initiative," the chairman of the Peace Now
movement, Yariv Oppenheimer told AFP.


"Israel's reaction so far has been between refusal and
indifference. There is no support for the initiative and that is
why we're here," he told AFP.


The Saudi-inspired plan envisages Arab states normalising ties
with Israel in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Arab land it
occupied in 1967, the creation of a Palestinian state and the
return of Palestinian refugees.


Israel has said it would look favourably at the peace initiative,
but has vehemently rejected the call for return of Palestinian
refugees to the Jewish state.
