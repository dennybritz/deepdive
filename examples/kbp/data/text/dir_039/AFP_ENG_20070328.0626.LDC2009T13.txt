The International Cricket Council (ICC) Wednesday penalised India
for a slow over rate during their World Cup first round defeat
against Sri Lanka last week.


"The Indian team bowled one over short during their stipulated
time and hence the captain Rahul Dravid is fined ten percent of
his match fee and every member is fined five percent," the ICC
announced in a statement.


India lost their crucial Group B match at Port of Spain by 69
runs, a defeat which virtually ruled them out of the World Cup on
Friday.


India's group rivals Bangladesh, to whom India lost their first
match by five wickets, overwhelmed Bermuda two days later, to
book their place in the Super Eights.


India, champions in 1983 and runners-up in last World Cup held in
South Africa in 2003, were ousted after losing two of their three
matches -- their worst ever performance in the World Cup since
the inaugural tournament in England in 1975.
