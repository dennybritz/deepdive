Women have taken a clear majority in an elected assembly in
Switzerland for the first time following municipal elections last
weekend in the city of Geneva, a Swiss newspaper reported.


Of the 80 members of Geneva's municipal assembly elected last
Sunday, 45 are women.


It was the first time that women had exceeded 50 percent
representation in a municipal assembly of a major Swiss town or
city, the Tribune de Geneve reported on Wednesday after examining
official data.


Women only received full voting rights at national level in
Switzerland in 1971.


Municipal assemblies form the third tier of Swiss government
behind the more powerful federal and cantonal (regional)
assemblies, where women's representation averages about one
quarter at the moment.


Just under 25 percent of the 246 members of the two houses of the
Swiss federal parliament are women, a relatively high proportion
by European standards.


Women represent 19.2 percent of the membership of national
parliaments in Europe, the ex-Soviet states and North America,
according to the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU), a global
association of parliaments.


For the moment there are no women in Geneva's municipal
government, unlike in four other cities. However, elections are
due on April 29.


Only Muri, a suburb of the capital Bern, has parity between male
and female reprsentatives on its municipal assembly.
