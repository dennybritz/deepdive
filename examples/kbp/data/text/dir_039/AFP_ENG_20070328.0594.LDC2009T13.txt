A Polish teenager was found hanged in his cell on Wednesday in a
prison near Athens, a judicial source said.


The 16-year-old, who was in custody awaiting trial for possessing
and using drugs, is thought to have used his sheets as a noose,
the source said.


He was recently moved from Avlona jail, north of Athens, to
Korydallos jail in the western suburbs after suffering
psychological problems.


Greek Justice Minister Anastassis Papaligouras has ordered an
inquiry.
