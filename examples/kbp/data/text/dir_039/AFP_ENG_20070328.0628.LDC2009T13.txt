Organizers of a Los Angeles bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics plan
on staging football matches in Las Vegas, San Francisco and San
Diego, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Wednesday.


The US Olympic Committee will decide April 14 in Washington
whether Chicago or Los Angeles will move forward as the US
nominee in a race also expected to include Tokyo, Madrid, Rome,
Prague, Rio de Janeiro and New Delhi.


The International Olympic Committee will formally approve
candidates next year and decide a 2016 host in October of 2009.


Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics, in 1932 and 1984,
while the last US city to host a Summer Games was Atlanta in
1996.


The Los Angeles bid hopes to use the glitz of the US gambling
mecca, former bid rival San Francisco and nearby San Diego as
preliminary football hosts to enhance its bid to stage the Games
from July 22 to August 7, 2016.
