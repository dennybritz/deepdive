The British Foreign Office condemned the broadcast of footage on
Iranian television showing sailors and marines detained last week
as "completely unacceptable."


"It is completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on
television," a Foreign Office spokesman told AFP.


"There is no doubt that all personnel were seized in Iraqi waters
and were entitled to be there.


"We expect immediate consular access as a prelude to the release
of the personnel and the return of their equipment."
