The White House insisted Wednesday that Saudi King Abdullah, a
key US ally among Arab states, was wrong to say the US military
presence in Iraq is an "illegitimate foreign occupation."


"The United States is in Iraq at the request of the Iraqis and
under a United Nations mandate. Any suggestion to the contrary is
wrong," said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe.


Earlier Wednesday, the Saudi king criticized the "occupation" of
Iraq in an opening speech to the annual Arab summit in Riyadh.


"In beloved Iraq, blood is being shed among brothers in the
shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation and ugly
sectarianism threatens civil war," Abdullah said.


US State Department spokesman Tom Casey stressed that the
Security Council had several times renewed its mandate for the US
presence in Iraq, which is now wracked by a deadly insurgency
following the US-led invasion in 2003.


"There is no question in our mind that our forces are there in a
legal and legitimate capacity in every sense of the word," Casey
said.


He denied however that the King's comments would affect US-Saudi
relations.


"I have only seen the press reports of what the king has said but
I think what is more important is that we do have very good and
very strong relations with Saudi Arabia," he told journalists in
Washington.


"I am sure we will have an opportunity to discuss these and other
issues with Saudi officials but I don't see anything that has
been reported on as fundamentally changing our good and long-
standing relations with Saudi Arabia."
