The Swiss government on Wednesday granted export credit
guarantees to four Swiss companies taking part in the
construction of the Ilisu dam in southeastern Turkey.


The Swiss government said in a statement that new measures put in
place by Turkey for the controversial project were enough to
secure the export guarantees.


They include water treatment stations, irrigation projects, and
new jobs and homes for local inhabitants who are forced to move
from the area.


The contracts for the Swiss companies -- a Swiss branch of French
industrial giant Alstom, Colenco, Stucki and Maggia -- have been
valued at a total of 225 million Swiss francs (139 million
euros).


Austrian and German firms are also involved in the massive
project to harness the energy of the Tigris river.


Environmental and civil society groups have sharply criticised
the dam because it would lead to the displacement of some 50,000
people and flood historical ruins from ancient Mesopotamia.
