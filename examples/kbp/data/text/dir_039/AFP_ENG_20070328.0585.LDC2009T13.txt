Britain's Foreign Secretary Margarett Beckett voiced concern
Wednesday at possible "coercion" after video footage showed a
detained sailor admitting entering Iranian waters.


She was speaking after Iranian state television broadcast footage
of 15 British sailors and marines captured last week in which the
sole woman, Faye Turney, was shown saying: "Obviously we
trespassed in the waters."


"I am very concerned about these pictures and any indication of
pressure on or coercion of our personnel who were carrying out a
routine operation in accordance with international law and under
a United Nations resolution in support of the Iraqi government,"
Beckett said in a statement.


"I am particularly disappointed that a private letter has been
used in a way which can only add to the distress of the
families," she added.


This was a reference to a letter released by the Iranian
authorities, purportedly written by 26-year-old Turney, in which
she said she had apologized to the Iranians for trespassing into
Iranian waters.


The hand-written letter, also shown on Iranian television, was
addressed to her mother and father.


"We have comprehensively demonstrated today that our personnel
were operating inside Iraqi territorial waters," said Beckett.


"As we have made clear repeatedly to the Iranian government, such
use of these images is totally unacceptable," she added.
