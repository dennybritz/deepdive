A senior Chinese official on a mission to strengthen ties with
Latin America met with the president of Surinam and top
government officials on Tuesday.


Li Changchun, a senior official of the Chinese Communist Party,
arrived heading a delegation of 80 people.


During the visit Li met with President Ronald Venetiaan and other
top government officials, including Foreign Affairs Minister
Lygia Kraag-Keteldijk.


At a ceremony at the presidential palace late Tuesday China
awarded Surinam a 2.4 million dollar grant.


The Chinese official earlier stopped in Mexico and Venezuela, and
is scheduled to travel to Peru and later the South Pacific island
nation of Samoa.


Surinam is a former Dutch colony on the northeastern shoulder of
South America and has a population of less than half a million.
