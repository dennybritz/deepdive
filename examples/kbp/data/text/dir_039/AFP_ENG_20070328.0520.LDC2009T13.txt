Britain's Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that American author
Dan Brown did not steal key elements from an earlier book for his
blockbuster novel "The Da Vinci Code".


Last April, Brown was cleared by the High Court of accusations
that he breached copyright by plagiarising passages and ideas
from "The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail", for his 2003 book.


Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, two of the earlier book's
authors, took their case to the appeal court and now face a legal
costs bill approaching three million pounds (six million dollars,
4.5 million euros).


"The Da Vinci Code" has sold more than 40 million copies around
the world, has been translated into 44 languages and has made
Brown, who did not attend the appeal hearing, a dollar multi-
millionaire.


"The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail" outlines a theory that Jesus
and Mary Magdalene married and had a child and that their
bloodline continues to the present day.


This is a similar theme to "The Da Vinci Code", but Brown has
dismissed the two mens' claims as "completely fanciful".


Their book was just one of many he studied for his novel, he
argued at the original court hearing.
