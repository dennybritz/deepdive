Six Eritrean players who refused to fly back home with the rest
of the team after a weekend international in Luanda have applied
for political asylum, Angolan officials said Wednesday.


Antenio Armando, a senior immigration service official, told
state radio that the request by the players would be assessed by
his department.


"Our role is to determine whether or not it is possible to accord
them the right to asylum after taking into account the reasons
that they have given," he said.


Angolan football federation (FAF) secretary-general Augusto Silva
confirmed that the players had sought asylum after the African
Nations Cup qualifier in Luanda at the weekend in which Angola
trounced Eritrea 6-1.


The US State Department added Eritrea earlier this month to its
blacklist of the world's worst human rights violators after the
Horn of Africa state backed an attempted takeover of neighbouring
Somalia by radical Islamists.
