Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal in Riyadh on Wednesday, one day after holding his first
talks with the Saudi king since ties chilled over Lebanon.


The two men talked for half an hour after the inaugural session
of a two-day summit of Arab heads of state in the Saudi capital,
an AFP correspondent reported.


A source in Assad's entourage said the meeting was a follow-up on
the "positive" talks the Syrian leader held with King Abdullah
late on Tuesday, and which focused on "normalising relations"
between the two countries and the situation in the region.


He did not give further details, but said Assad would also have
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday on the
sidelines of the summit.


Assad's meeting with Abdullah was the first since Damascus and
Riyadh fell out over the wisdom of pro-Syrian Hezbollah's capture
of two Israeli soldiers which sparked the 34-day Israeli
onslaught on Lebanon last summer.


Relations were further strained over Syrian policy in Lebanon in
recent months after the opposition led by Shiite Hezbollah
launched a campaign to oust the government of Western-backed
Sunni Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, who is close to Saudi Arabia.


Saudi-led efforts to resolve the crisis in Lebanon failed to
yield a breakthrough in the runup to the Arab summit.
