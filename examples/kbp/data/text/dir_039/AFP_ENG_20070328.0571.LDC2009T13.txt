A Senate panel on Wednesday approved Washington's outgoing
ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, to be the new US envoy to
the United Nations.


By a voice vote, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved
Khalilzad's nomination, which now goes to the full Senate for
consideration.


If confirmed, he would succeed John Bolton, who was finally
forced to resign from the post in December after 17 months,
following Democrats' persistent refusal to confirm his
nomination.


Bolton, a sharp-tongued hawk, had been a controversial
appointment because of his past harsh criticism of the United
Nations, and his predisposition for confrontation over diplomacy.


Khalilzad, an ethnic Pashtun born in Mazar-i-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan, attended the American University in Beirut before
earning a doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1979.


He once worked as an executive in the American oil giant UNOCAL
and the State Department and the Pentagon as well as the National
Security Council, where he specialized in policy towards the Gulf
and Central Asia.


Khalilzad served as Washington's envoy to Kabul prior to his
service in Baghdad.
