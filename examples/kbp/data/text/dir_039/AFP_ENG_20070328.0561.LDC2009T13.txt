A Freetown court announced on Wednesday that former Sierra
Leoneon defence minister Sam Hinga Norman, who was on trial for
war crimes, died in February of natural causes.


In a statement, the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) said
the autopsy into the 67-year-old's death in a military hospital
in Dakar on February 22 revealed he died of a myocardial
infection.


Norman had been transferred from his prison cell in Freetown in
January for medical reasons, and underwent surgery on February 8.


An SCSL statement released after his death said there had been no
complications in the operation, and the court ordered an
independent inquiry.


The autopsy was carried out in the presence of medical experts
nominated by the SCSL and the Sierra Leone government. Former
vice-president Albert Joe Demby, a doctor, also attended to
represent Norman's family, the SCSL said.


Norman was the former head of the country's notorious Kamajor
tribal militia, which was created more than a decade ago to
replace mercenaries as the security force of the government.


He had pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, acts of terrorism
and enlisting child soldiers in the militia during decade-long
fighting against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels
which claimed 200,000 lives.


The civil war ended in 2001 and Norman's trial opened June 2004.
He was awaiting a verdict when he died.
