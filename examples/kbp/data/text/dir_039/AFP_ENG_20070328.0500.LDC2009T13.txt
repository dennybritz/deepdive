Zimbabwe police said Wednesday they had arrested 10 opposition
supporters during a raid on the offices of the Movement for
Democratic Change but denied leader Morgan Tsvangirai had been
detained.


"We never arrested him," police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena told
reporters after the MDC said Tsvangirai had been among a group of
around 20 party activists who had been arrested.


Bvudzijena said that the raid on the party headquarters in
downtown Harare was part of an investigation into several
firebombings in the last few days which the police have blamed on
the opposition.


Twenty-five people had been arrested on Tuesday and 10 during the
raid on Wednesday, he added.
