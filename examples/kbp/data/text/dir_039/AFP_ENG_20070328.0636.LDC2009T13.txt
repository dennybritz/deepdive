Nineteen people have been confirmed dead and seven others are
missing after a coal mine gas explosion in northern China, state
media said Thursday.


The bodies of the dead have been recovered and rescuers are
searching for the missing people at the mine, in Linfen city, in
Shanxi province, the official Xinhua news agency said.


The explosion occurred at around 11:30 am (0330 GMT) Wednesday
when 106 miners were working underground. Eighty managed to
escape, including one who was severely injured, rescuers said.


Local safety authorities said the mine's production licence had
expired.


Twenty-one miners were killed in a gas blast at another Shanxi
mine on March 18, Xinhua said.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
