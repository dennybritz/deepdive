The US government named a Colombian-based man, identified as
Fabio Enrique Ochoa Vasco, as a "major" drug trafficker
Wednesday, saying it was seeking to put his sprawling criminal
network out of business.


The US Treasury claimed Ochoa Vasco, who is also known as Carlos
Mario, presides over a vast drug-smuggling empire stretching
across Central America, and is offering a reward of up to five
million dollars for tips leading to his arrest.


"Fabio Enrique Ochoa Vasco is the head of one of the most
powerful Medellin- based drug trafficking organizations today,"
Adam Szubin, the director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC), said in a statement.


"Our action today strikes at his massive financial empire with
the aim of depriving him of the benefit of his criminal
activities," Szubin said.


The move places Ochoa Vasco on a high profile US government list
of designated drug traffickers, as well as vying to freeze any
assets controlled by him and his lieutenants.


The Treasury said it was seeking an asset freeze of companies
controlled by Ochoa Vasco in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala,
Honduras, and Mexico among other measures.


A Florida court charged Ochoa Vasco with cocaine trafficking in
2004.
