West Indies were 114-5 after 30 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against Australia at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium
here on Wednesday chasing 323 to win.


The West Indies innings had been held over from Tuesday because
of rain.


Skipper Brian Lara was on 50 with Denesh Ramdin on 5.


Shaun Tait got the first breakthrough when he trapped Shivnarine
Chanderpaul lbw for five in the fourth over with a full length
delivery and the score on 11-1.


Glenn McGrath then dismissed Chris Gayle for 2 when the opener
skied a shot to Shane Watson in the eighth over with Marlon
Samuels getting out in almost identical fashion when he was
caught by Andrew Symonds for four, off McGrath, with the score on
20.


Ramnaresh Sarwan went with the score on 91 after making 29 off 58
balls when he clobbered a Brad Hogg full toss into the safe hands
of Australia skipper Ricky Ponting.


Dwayne Bravo then handed McGrath his third wicket of the innings
when he also holed out to Ponting after making just 9 with the
total having crawled to 107-5 in the 29th over.


Matthew Hayden had hit 158 in the Australia innings, his second
successive century and the highest score ever made by an
Australian at the World Cup.
