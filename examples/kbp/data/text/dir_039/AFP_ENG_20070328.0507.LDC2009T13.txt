Arab leaders meeting in Riyadh on Wednesday unanimously adopted a
resolution reviving a five-year-old peace offer to Israel, a
minister said.


The resolution reviving the Saudi-inspired peace blueprint first
endorsed in 2002 was adopted during a closed-door session of the
Arab summit which opened in the Saudi capital earlier on
Wednesday, the minister told AFP, requesting anonymity.


All other resolutions submitted by Arab foreign ministers to the
heads of state were also adopted, he said.
