France got a rare glimpse of their president's only grandchild
Wednesday, after 11-year-old Martin Rey-Chirac was photographed
next to his grandfather watching military exercises.


The son of Jacques Chirac's daughter Claude and Olympic judo
champion Thierry Rey, Martin was shown in leather jacket and
sweatshirt on the front page of the popular daily Aujourd'hui -
Le Parisien.


French journalists traditionally keep a respectful distance from
the private lives of politicians, and Martin's face was till now
unknown to the public.


Billed as Chirac's farewell to the armed forces, the visit to the
southwestern town of Bayonne marked the first time that the
president -- who steps down next month -- has brought his
grandson to an official function.


Chirac has two daughters: Claude, 44, who acts as his media
advisor, and Laurence, 49, who suffers from a mental disorder and
lives in an institution.
