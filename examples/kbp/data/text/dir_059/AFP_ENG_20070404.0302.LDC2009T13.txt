Two French aid workers and three Afghan employees have gone
missing in Afghanistan, the French foreign ministry said
Wednesday.


The aid organisation Terre d'enfance (Children's Land) alerted
the foreign ministry about the disappearance on Tuesday morning.


"The foreign ministry and our embassy in Kabul is attentively
following this case and we are in liaison with local authorities
and the French NGO," said foreign ministry spokesman Denis
Simonneau, who declined to give further details.


Terre d'enfance is running a humanitarian project in Zaranj in
southwest Afghanistan, near the border with Iran, where the two
aid workers and eight Afghans worked.


Reached by AFP, an official with Terre d'enfance declined to give
details about the aid workers.
