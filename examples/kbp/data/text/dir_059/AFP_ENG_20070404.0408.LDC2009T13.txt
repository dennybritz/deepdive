The United States on Wednesday said there was no link between the
sudden granting of consular access to five Iranians held in Iraq,
and the release of 15 British naval personnel detained in Iran.


"Not that I am aware of," said State Department spokesman Tom
Casey when asked if there was a connection between the decision
to allow Iranian representatives to see the five arrested by US
forces in Iraq January 11 and the release of the Britons.
