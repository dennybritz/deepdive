US House speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived on Wednesday in key-
regional ally Saudi Arabia, the latest destination on her
controversial Middle East tour, an AFP photographer said.


She was greeted in the Saudi capital Riyadh by the kingdom's
ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubair.


She was traveling from Syria, and a meeting with President Bashar
al-Assad. US President George W. Bush criticised her for sending
"mixed signals" that harmed his administration's efforts to
isolate Assad's regime over its alleged support for terrorism and
accusations of meddling in Iraq and Lebanon.
