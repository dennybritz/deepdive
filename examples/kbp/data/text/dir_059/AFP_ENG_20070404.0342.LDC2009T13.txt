US share prices opened slightly higher Wednesday as investors
greeted news that Iran was to free 15 British sailors, lifting a
market that was consolidating from a big rally.


The opening came just after Iran announced plans to free the 15
British detainees in an apparent end to a two-week stalemate. The
news triggered a steep drop in crude oil futures.


In opening trades in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 7.40 points (0.06 percent) to 12,517.60 while the Nasdaq
composite edged up 4.12 points (0.17 percent) to 2,454.45.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index added a fractional
0.19 points (0.01 percent) to 1,437.96.


The market was digesting a big rally in the prior session that
stemmed in part from hopes of an end to the two-week-old Iran-
Britain crisis.


Fred Dickson, market strategist at DA Davidson, said he expected
stocks to hold in a relatively narrow range, with an upward bias.


"We do expect the stock market to consolidate recent gains then
attempt to move up further ahead of earnings season," he said.


"There is simply too much money sitting on the sidelines that
needs to be invested ...  Although we expect a decent earnings
reporting season, we believe that if the upcoming earnings season
proves to be slightly disappointing, investors with lots of cash
sit ready to pounce on bargains as they emerge from anxious
sellers following the earnings announcements."
