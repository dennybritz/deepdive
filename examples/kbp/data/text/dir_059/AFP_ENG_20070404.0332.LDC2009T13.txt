World oil prices, which were already falling on Wednesday,
extended losses after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said
that 15 British sailors captured by Iran will be freed
immediately.


The release of the marines and sailors, including one woman,
comes almost a fortnight after the group was seized for allegedly
being in Iranian waters.


In London trading, the price of Brent North Sea crude for May
delivery shed 56 cents to 67.25 dollars in electronic deals.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, slid 49 cents to 64.15 dollars in pit trading.


Concerns that the stand-off could have led to Iran, the world's
fourth largest oil producer, to disrupt its crude exports,
propelled crude futures to seven- month peaks above 69 dollars a
barrel in London on Monday.


Iran had stalled over the sailors' release after Britain had
insisted that the 15 were seized in Iraqi waters on March 23.
Tehran maintains that they were in Iranian waters when captured.


Iran is already under the international spotlight over its
disputed nuclear ambitions.
