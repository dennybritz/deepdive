Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday attacked
Britain for sending the crisis over the arrested sailors to the
UN Security Council and using "media hype".


"The Blair government chose the path of media hype and sent the
issue to the UN Security Council," Ahmadinejad told a news
conference.


"The British people can ask its government what the British
soldiers are doing in Iraq or in Iranian waters," he said.
