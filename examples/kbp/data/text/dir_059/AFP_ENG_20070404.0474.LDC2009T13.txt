Sri Lanka were 183-4 after 40 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against England at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium
here Wednesday.


Chamara Silva was on 12 with Tillakaratne Dilshan on one.


Sanath Jayasuriya, making a word record 385th one-day appearance,
was the first man out bowled by Sajid Mahmood for 25 in the
eighth over with the score on 37.


Kumar Sangakkara was then caught by Paul Collingwood off Mahmood
for 17 with the score on 69 off the first ball off the 19th over.


Upal Tharanga was then caught by Kevin Pietersen off Andrew
Flintoff for a solid 62 with captain Mahela Jayawardene following
soon after as he tried to boost the run rate.


Jayawardene was caught by Ed Joyce out on the midwicket boundary
off Paul Collingwood with the score on 175 in the 39th over.


England skipper Michael Vaughan won the toss and elected to
field.


Sri Lanka were unchanged from the side that beat West Indies by
113 runs on Sunday and England went in with the same team that
defeated Ireland by 48 runs on Friday.


Sri Lanka, the 1996 champions, currently have four points to lie
third in the Super Eights and England only two after losing to
fellow qualifiers New Zealand in the group stage.
