President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday the British
government had promised not to repeat the incident which saw 15
of its sailors seized for entering Iranian waters.


"The British government, in a letter, has vowed not to repeat
such incidents. But this release is not linked to this letter. It
is due to Islamic goodwill," he told a news conference.


It followed his announcment that the 14 men and one woman would
be freed imminently.
