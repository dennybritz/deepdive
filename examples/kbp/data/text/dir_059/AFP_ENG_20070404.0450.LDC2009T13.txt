Saudi Arabia on Wednesday executed a Yemeni convicted of child
murder and a Saudi found guilty of drug smuggling, the interior
ministry announced.


The Yemeni man, Majid al-Adni, was executed in the southern Jizan
province for murdering an eight-year old boy and sexually
assaulting another, the interior ministry said in statement
carried by the official SPA news agency.


The Saudi man, Mohammed al-Ruthwan, was executed in the eastern
city of Al Khobar for drug smuggling, the ministry announced in a
separate SPA statement.


The executions bring to 28 the number announced by the Saudi
government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public by beheading in
ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of
sharia, or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
