Syria must stop supporting terrorism before the Jewish state will
resume peace negotiations with its neighbour, a statement from
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office said on Wednesday.


The statement followed a controversial meeting in Damascus
between US House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad, after which Pelosi said both Assad and Olmert were
ready to resume peace talks.


"To carry out real peace negotiations Syria must cease its
support for terrorism," the statement from Olmert's office said.


Pelosi told journalists earlier that the Syrian leader was "ready
to engage in negotiations (for) peace with Israel."


"The meeting with the president enabled us to communicate the
message from Prime Minister Olmert that Israel is ready to engage
peace talks as well," Pelosi said.


Olmert's office was quick to respond, repeating Israeli demands
that Syria "stop sheltering Hamas and Islamic Jihad, stop
providing arms to Hezbollah, and stop undermining stability in
Lebanon."


"Syria must moreover cease its support for terrorism in Iraq and
its strategic ties with the radical Iranian regime," the
statement added.


Olmert recently rejected Syrian overtures to resume peace talks,
which have been frozen since 2000.


Damascus demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, conquered by Israeli in 1967 and annexed in 1981. Over
15,000 Israelis now live in the annexed land which Israel says is
crucial to its security.


Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights is not recognised
internationally.
