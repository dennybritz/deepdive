Russian authorities want a European body to investigate the
deaths of 127 seals in the Caspian Sea, environmental officials
said Wednesday.


Russia's environmental authority wants the Organisation for
Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE) to investigate the
seal deaths, which it suspects to be related to petroleum
activity, it said in a statement.


The authority said it had repeatedly attempted to draw attention
to alleged violations of environmental regulations related to
petroleum production and transport in the Caspian Sea.


The Russian enviornmental authority was the focus of much
attention late last year after pulling the drilling licences for
several Russian petroleum companies. The companies were suspected
of polluting water, destroying forests and installing pipelines
in protected zones.
