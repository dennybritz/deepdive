Spanish police said Wednesday they had detained nine people who
allegedly sold a synthetic drug popularly known as "shabu" in the
Philippines which is still largely unknown in Europe.


Police suspect the nine sold the drug, also known as "crank",
"ice" or "benny", to members of the Filipino community in the
northeastern port city of Barcelona, they said in a statement.


All but one of the detained was either a Filipino citizen or a
Spanish national of Filipino descent.


Police also seized equipment used to package and consume the drug
as well as a small amount of the narcotic as part of their
operation.
