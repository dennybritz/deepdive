EasyHotel, part of the London-based no-frills easyGroup, said on
Wednesday it planned to build 38 budget properties in 17
countries, with six properties planned for India.


Istithmar Hotels, a subsidiary of United Arab Emirates investment
group Istithmar, will work with easyGroup, investing more than
400 million dollars (299 million euros) over the next five years
to build the properties, the two companies told a news
conference.


EasyHotel opened its first budget hotel in 2005 in a swish part
of central London with its rooms starting at 20 pounds (29 euros,
39 dollars) per night.


EasyHotel is the latest venture for easyGroup founder and Cypriot
billionaire Stelios Haji-Ioannou, whose group also runs the
easyJet airline and has interests in areas including cinema,
pizza delivery and a cruise line.


The some 3,800 new rooms will be pre-fabricated at a single
manufacturing site as self-contained units, which are then
constructed into a hotel using a "stack, connect and stick"
building concept, easyHotel said.
