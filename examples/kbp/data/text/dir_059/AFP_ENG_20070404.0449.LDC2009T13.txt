Societe Generale has agreed to purchase the fourth biggest lender
in Macedonia, Ohridska Bank, for 43 million euros (57.4 million
dollars), Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said Wednesday.


The French bank would complete the buy-out of Ohridska in the
coming days after already having purchased 51.2 percent of its
shares, Gruevski told reporters.


It would acquire the rest of Ohridska's stock at 133 euros per
share.


"The bank will open 13 new branches throughout the country in the
coming months," said Gruevski.


Four foreign banks -- the National Bank of Greece, Alpha Bank,
Turkey's Ziraat bankasi and Ljubljanska Banka of Slovenia --
already have presence in the former Yugoslav republic.
