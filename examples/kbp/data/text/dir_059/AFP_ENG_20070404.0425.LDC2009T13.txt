Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Wednesday said it will resume
flights to Sri Lanka after suspending services following a rebel
attack on an airbase next to the island's only international
airport.


"Safety is always our top priority," chief operating officer Tony
Tyler said, adding that Cathay would resume services from April
22.


Cathay, Asia's third largest carrier, suspended services in March
after the Air Tigers dropped bombs during a pre-dawn attack on
the airbase.


It was the first such air sortie by the Tamil Tigers. The main
airport was also closed for three hours following the attack to
ensure the safety of passengers and civilian aircraft.


Cathay said the airline acted out of concern for the safety of
its passengers and crew.


"Now that enhanced security measures are being put in place, we
are happy to be able to resume flights to the country," Tyler
said in a statement.


Before the suspension, Cathay operated daily flights to Colombo
from Hong Kong.
