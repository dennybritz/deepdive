German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Wednesday
welcomed Iran's release of 15 British sailors and said he hoped
it signalled a new attitude of cooperation from the Islamic
republic.


"I hope that the British sailors will be free as soon as possible
and that they will be able to spend the Easter holidays at home,"
Steinmeier told journalists.


"Congratulations to the British government which apparently
achieved this solution through diplomatic contacts."


In a reference to Iran's standoff with the international
community over its nuclear programme, Steinmeier said: "This is a
start and I hope that this start will open the door to further
cooperation."


He said the international community was ready to resume
negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue at any time.


Germany currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the
European Union.


Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for purely civilian
purposes, but the United States and many Western nations believe
it is covertly developing atomic weapons.


Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced on Wednesday that
the sailors would be released as a 'gift' to the people of
Britain in a dramatic end to a two-week ordeal that had sparked a
fresh diplomatic crisis between Tehran and the West.
