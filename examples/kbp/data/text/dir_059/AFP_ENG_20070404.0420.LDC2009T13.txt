Three Chinese nationals were arrested in Switzerland after
running up bills worth thousands of Swiss francs for hotels and
luxury goods on forged credit cards, police said Wednesday.


The two men and a woman were caught on Tuesday when a bank
alerted the authorities after they had paid a hotel and
restaurant bill in the northwestern town of Delemont with forged
credit cards.


They were arrested prior to boarding a train for Paris, from
where they had planned to travel back to China, the police said
in a statement.


The police also seized brand-name goods such as Louis Vuitton and
Yves St- Laurent handbags.


The forged credit cards were made in Hong Kong, and used copies
of magnetic strips off genuine cards stolen in Australia or New
Zealand, the police said.
