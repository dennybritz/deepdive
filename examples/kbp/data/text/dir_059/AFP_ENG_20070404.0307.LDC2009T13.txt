A Jordanian man suspected of money laundering for the Al-Qaeda
terror network was on Wednesday banned by a Tirana court from
leaving Albania.


Hamzeh Abu Rayyan could "not leave Albanian until the end of a
probe over financing of organisations and companies suspected of
links with Al-Qaeda," the court ruled.


Rayyan, an accountant for fellow Jordanian Abdul Latif Saleh, who
is wanted by the United States on charges of financing terrorism,
was "suspected of money laundering and concealing funds" on
Saleh's behalf.


Last July, the finance ministry seized property from Saleh and
his partners and launched an investigation into an alleged
attempt to use charitable activities as a front to launder money
linked with terrorism in Albania.


According to a United States Treasury Department document
published by Albanian media, "Bin Laden deposited some 600,000
dollars (512,000 euros) in Latif Saleh's bank accounts to create
and support extremist Islamist groups in Albania."
