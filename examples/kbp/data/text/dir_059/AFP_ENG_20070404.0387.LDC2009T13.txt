Challengers to Alinghi's America's Cup crown caught a glimpse of
what they were up against when the Swiss champions won the second
regatta at the final preliminary heats for the Louis-Vuitton Cup
here Wednesday.


Staged in testing, blustery conditions Alinghi's boat, SUI 91,
skippered by New Zealander Ed Baird, coped best with the testing
wind to lead Spain's Desafio Espanol across the line.


Team New Zealand took third.


There was misfortune for the Chinese challenger China Team which
trailed in last after the boom snapped allowing the mainsail to
sky up in the air, billowing and uncontrolled.


Act 13 is the final preliminary leg in which Alinghi's 11
challengers gain bonus points ahead of the Louis Vuitton Cup
(April 16-May 7).


The Louis-Vuitton winner earns the right to take on Alinghi in
the 32nd America's Cup best of nine race match in June.


While her challengers have plenty of action ahead Act 13, which
concludes on Friday, is the last time Alinghi, from landlocked
Switzerland, will race in anger ahead of the defence of her title
captured in Auckland Bay in New Zealand four years ago.
