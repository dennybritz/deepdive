President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday reaffirmed his oft
repeated position that Iran was ready to negotiate with the
United States but only if Washington changes its position.


"Today we have no objection to relations (with Washington) but
this requires US action," Ahmadinejad told reporters.


The United States has said it will talk to Iran but only if the
Islamic republic suspends uranium enrichment, something it has
hitherto vehemently refused to do.
