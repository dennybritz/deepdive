German leaders Schalke 04 will have to do without their Danish
international striker Peter Lovenkrands for the rest of the
season.


The 27-year-old former Rangers star was stretchered off in
Schalke's 2-0 loss to Bayern Munich at the weekend and had to
undergo surgery on his injured right heel.


He had already missed six weeks of the campaign with a similar
problem.


Schalke lead the Bundesliga by three points from Werder Bremen
with a resurgent Bayern lying fourth, six points off the summit.
