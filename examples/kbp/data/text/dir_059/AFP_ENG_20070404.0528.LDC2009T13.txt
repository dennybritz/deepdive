Pakistan Wednesday said it had discussed with India its concerns
about outside involvement in a tribal insurgency in its restive
Baluchistan province, a report said.


"We did raise that (matter with the prime minister)," Pakistan
Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said after meeting his Indian
counterpart here, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.


"Without getting into the specifics of what I discussed, let me
say that these are the type of issues which do get discussed at
various levels... because there is a perception that this may be
happening," Aziz said after bilateral talks with his Indian
counterpart Manmohan Singh Wednesday.


The Pakistani premier has been in India for a summit of South
Asian leaders.


The gas-rich Baluchistan has been in the grip of a two-year
insurgency launched by ethnic Baluch rebels who want more
political rights and a greater share of profits from the region's
natural resources.
