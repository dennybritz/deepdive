Guinea-Bissau police on Wednesday said they had arrested four
soldiers and two "whites" after discovering 635 kilos (1,400
pounds) of cocaine in the vehicle they were driving.


"We saw a suspicious car last night (Tuesday). When the car
reached where we were we ordered it to stop and we discovered a
suspicious package which after it was checked turned out to
contain cocaine," a police officer who had been at the scene told
AFP by telephone.


Police then arrested the four Guinea Bissau soldiers and two
"whites" in the vehicle, which was pulled over in Jugudul some 50
kilometres (31 miles) east of the capital, added the source, who
asked not to be named.


The detainees' nationalities were not disclosed.


"It's a 635-kilo booty. We do not know who it belongs to and to
whom it was destined," said senior police officer Orlando Da
Silva.


Guinea-Bissau police seized 674 kilos of cocaine in September and
three months later the coast guard found more than two tonnes of
cocaine abandoned by smugglers on the Bijagos islands.


Guinea-Bissau, which is one of the world's poorest countries, has
in recent years become a prime transit stop for drug traffickers
trying to reach South America and Europe.
