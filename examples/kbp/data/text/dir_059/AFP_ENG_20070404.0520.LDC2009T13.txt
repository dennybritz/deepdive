The Slovak Football Association (SFZ) on Wednesday sacked its
acting general secretary, Vladimir Wanke, following his arrest in
a corruption sting.


Wanke was arrested last month by an "agent provocateur", whose
use is allowed under Slovak law for fighting corruption, as he
was pocketing a 10,000 Slovak koruna (around 290 euros, 380
dollars) bribe linked to a player transfer.


Wanke allegedly demanded the bribe from the president of
Slovakian second division club Mocenok, Stanislav Szabo, to
ensure the speedy transfer of Andrej Masarovic from an Austrian
club. Wanke denies the accusations.
