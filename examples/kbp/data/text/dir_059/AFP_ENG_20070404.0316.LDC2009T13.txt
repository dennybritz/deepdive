Two strong earthquakes rocked the Loyalty Islands region of the
South Pacific on Wednesday, two days after an 8.0-magnitude quake
spawned a tsunami in the Solomon Islands, experts said.


No damage was immediately reported from the first 6.3-magnitude
quake, which hit at 7:26 am (2026 GMT Tuesday), 136 kilometres
(84 miles) southwest of Isangel in Vanuatu and 137 kilometres
northeast of New Caledonia's Loyalty Islands.


No tsunami warning was issued for the earthquake.


A second quake, also magnitude 6.3, hit at 10:00 pm (1100 GMT)
close by at a depth of 10 kilometres. No damage was immediately
reported and no tsunami warning issued.


The Pacific region has been on tenterhooks since a huge undersea
quake on Monday triggered a devastating tsunami. At least 30
people have been reported killed near its epicentre in the
Solomons.


That quake has been followed by scores of aftershocks measuring
up to 6.7 in magnitude that have kept terrified Solomon Islanders
from returning to their homes.
