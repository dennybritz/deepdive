US oil inventories were mixed over the past week as crude
reserves were replenished while gasoline stocks saw a big drop,
goverment data showed Wednesday.


Crude inventories jumped by 4.3 million barrels to 332.7 million
in the week to March 30, the Department of Energy said. That was
well ahead of market forecasts of a gain of 500,000 barrels.


The DoE's weekly report showed that gasoline reserves, closely
watched as the summer driving season arrives, fell by five
million barrels to 205.2 million, against a forecasted drawdown
of 300,000 barrels.


Distillate inventories, which include heating oil and diesel,
were unchanged at 118 million, against a forecast of a decline of
one million barrels.


New York crude oil futures prices fell 36 cents to 64.28 dollars
a barrel in the wake of the data.
