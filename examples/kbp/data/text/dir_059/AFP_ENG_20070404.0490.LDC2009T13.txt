A bomb exploded late Tuesday outside a Montreal Jewish cultural
and sports center, but it caused no damage and nobody was
injured, police told AFP.


"A small blast" occurred about 11 pm (0300 GMT Wednesday) while
employees were still inside the Ben Weider center, Montreal
police spokeswoman Marie-Claude Berard said.


The center had received "no threats" beforehand, she added.


Meanwhile, police acknowledged "some progress" in their
investigation of another explosion that ripped through a Jewish
school library in Montreal in September 2006, but did not reveal
specifics.


La Presse reported Wednesday that the same person may have thrown
a Molotov cocktail through the school window and burned a nearby
vehicle a few days later, but police would not confirm the link.


Montreal is home to the largest Jewish community in Canada with
more than 100,000 people.
