Commonwealth Games 400 metres champion Christine Ohuruogu's hopes
of ever racing in the Olympics ended on Wednesday after she lost
her appeal against a year-long suspension for missing out on
anti-doping tests, international sport's top court announced on
Wednesday.


A panel of judges at the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS)
ruled that Ohurugou had committed a doping offence under the
rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations
(IAAF), and that the suspension was valid.


"The Panel considered that the suspension was proportionate and
should not be disturbed," CAS said in a statement.


The 22-year-old Briton, who had been touted as a potential star
of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, was suspended for a year by UK
Athletics last August after missing three out-of-competition
drugs tests over a period of 18 months.


Under British Olympic Association rules she faces a lifetime ban
from the Olympics and she had said last September that there
would be no point in continuing to compete if she could not run
in the Games.
