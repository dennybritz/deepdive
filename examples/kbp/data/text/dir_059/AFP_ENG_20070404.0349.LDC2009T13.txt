Algeria's court of appeal reduced on Wednesday the sentences
imposed on a director of a newspaper and one of the daily's
journalists for libelling the Libyan leader Colonel Moamer
Kadhafi.


The court suspended a six-month prison sentence imposed last
October by a lower court on the director of the Ech-Chorouk
Arabic-language daily, Ali Fodil, and one of his reporters, Naila
Berrahal.


It also cancelled fines imposed on the pair of 20,000 dinars (220
euros, 270 dollars) in damages and interest after being found
guilty in the case which was brought by Kadhafi himself.


A 500,000-dinar fine on the publishing company was also reduced
to 50,000 dinars.


The Libyan leader filed the libel suit in neighbouring Algeria
after Ech- Chourouk published articles on August 3 and 12 last
year reporting a "prefabricated plan by Colonel Kadhafi to divide
the Tuaregs and destabilise Algeria."


Kadhafi said that the reports, which quoted unnamed chiefs of
Tuareg communities in Algeria, Niger and Mali, were unproven and
"an insult to the person of the victim (Kadhafi)" and "the
security of the Algerian and Libyan states."
