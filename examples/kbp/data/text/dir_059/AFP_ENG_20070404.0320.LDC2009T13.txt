Australia sprinter Robbie McEwen has pulled out of Sunday's Tour
of Flanders with flu, his Predictor team announced here on
Wednesday.


"Robbie is hardly suffering at all with his back after his falls
in the Tirreno- Adriatico and Milan-San Remo, but is down with
flu," Predictor manager Marc Sergeant told AFP.


"He wasn't able to train Wednesday and so we've decided not to
let him start on Sunday."
