A UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday jailed a former Bosnian
Serb policeman for 15 years after he pleaded guilty to raping and
torturing Bosnian Muslim women during the 1992-1995 war.


Dragan Zelenovic, 46, had admitted to seven charges of crimes
against humanity, including rape and torture, in a plea deal that
saw prosecutors drop seven war crimes charges.


One of the cases involved the multiple rape of a 15-year-old
girl.


He was the first suspect to plead guilty to a rape charge before
the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
in the Hague.


In handing down the 15-year prison term, Dutch judge Alphons Orie
followed the maximum sentence recommended by the prosecution. It
was not yet clear whether an appeal would be lodged.
