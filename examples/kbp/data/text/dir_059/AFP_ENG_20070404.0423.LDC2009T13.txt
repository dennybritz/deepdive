Russia welcomed on Wednesday Iran's release of 15 captured
British sailors, describing it as a "goodwill gesture."


"We view this as a goodwill gesture on the part of the Iranian
leadership," Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov was
quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.


"Certain actions, appeals to the Iranians by us, also had an
effect," he said.


"We proceeded mainly from humanitarian considerations and also
from the fact that such incidents serve to increase tensions,
which is highly undesirable under the circumstances."


Earlier Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that the
14 men and one woman would be freed as a "gift" to the people of
Britain.
