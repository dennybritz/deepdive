Former Togolese international captain Salou Tadjou has died at
the age of 33 years following a long illness, his family said
Wednesday.


Tadjou, who played in defence, competed with several local clubs
before continuing his professional career with Esperance in
Tunisia and Swiss first division club Servette.


He played Togo's first match in combined qualifiers for the 2006
African Nations Cup and the 2006 World Cup against Zambia, but
was not selected for the squad who reached the finals in Germany
last year.
