France on Wednesday welcomed a "happy ending" after Iran
announced it will release 15 British sailors who were captured 13
days ago that had triggering a diplomatic crisis.


"France hails the announcement of the release of the British
sailors," Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said.


"We now hope that this release will take place as soon as
possible," he said.


Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made the surprise
announcement at a Tehran news conference, saying their release
was a "gift" to the people of Britain.


An aide to the president said the 14 men and one woman would fly
out of Tehran on Thursday, although Ahmadinejad had initially
said they would be going home on Wednesday.


Douste-Blazy said there was "no link" between the fate of the 15
British sailors and that of a French researcher in Iran whose
passport was seized on January 30 during a trip to a province
bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan.


"The case of our compatriot has no link whatsoever with the
detention of the British sailors," said the foreign minister.


Stephane Dudoignon, who works for the National Center for
Scientific Research (CNRS), was briefly detained during a trip to
the southeastern Sistan- Baluchestan province and his passport
confiscated.


No charges have been laid against him, but police have yet to
return his passport, said the foreign ministry.


France has called on Iran to quickly find a solution allowing
Dudoignon to leave Iran.
