Germany on Wednesday welcomed signs from Poland that it is ready
to lift a veto on talks between the European Union and Russia
about a new cooperation pact, but said the matter was not
settled.


"It is correct that the Polish side has indicated to the
Commission that they have withdrawn their opposition," foreign
ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger told a press conference.


"This is but a first step, it is not a final solution. But it is
an important first step towards the adoption of the mandate to
negotiate, and we obviously welcome it."


European Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger said in
Brussels earlier that Poland had given "indications" it will drop
its veto which was imposed in retaliation for a Russian embargo
on Polish meat.


This has long delayed negotiations to replace an accord which
expires at the end of 2007.


Diplomats in Brussels indicated however that a formal agreement
to start talks was unlikely until Russia lifted its embargo.


In Warsaw, Polish President Lech Kaczynski told reporters: "We
will lift our veto when we have guarantees that the embargo will
be lifted."


Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU until the
end of June, is eager to get the negotiations off the ground on
its watch.


The new agreement is viewed as crucial by Chancellor Angela
Merkel at a time when Europe wants to secure its long-term energy
supplies amid fears that Russia is using its oil and gas
resources as a foreign policy tool.
