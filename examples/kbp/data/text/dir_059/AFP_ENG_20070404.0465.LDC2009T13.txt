Armenian President Robert Kocharian on Wednesday confirmed former
defence minister Serge Sarkisian as the country's new prime
minister, the president's press office said in a statement.


The ruling Republican party nominated Sarkisian, a close ally of
Kocharian and a favourite to replace the president in 2008, for
the post on Monday.


He succeeds Andranik Margarian, who died of a heart attack on
March 25 after seven years as prime minister.


Like Kocharian, Sarkisian is from the disputed region of Nagorny
Karabakh and fought in the 1988-1994 war in which Armenia seized
the enclave from Azerbaijan.


Sarkisian also chairs the Republican party's ruling council and
is expected to play a key role in the party's campaign for May 12
parliamentary elections.
