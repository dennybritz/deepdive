A "ceremony" for the release of the 15 British sailors has begun,
an Iranian official said on Wednesday after President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad announced they would be freed.


Bijan Nobaveh, a veteran Iranian journalist moderating the news
conference, invited reporters at the conference in the
presidential compound in southern Tehran to transfer to another
room to meet the naval personnel.
