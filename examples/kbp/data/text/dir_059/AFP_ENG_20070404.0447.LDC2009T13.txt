British bank Barclays, which is seeking a merger with Dutch peer
ABN Amro, on Wednesday said it would sell part of Monument, its
US credit card division, to US group CompuCredit Corporation.


The sale, for approximately 390 million pounds (577 million
euros, 771 million dollars) in cash, was expected to complete by
the end of the second quarter, the bank said in an official
statement.


The sale price was 100 million pounds less than the net book
value of the credit card portfolio.


Barclays added that its Barclaycard credit card unit would retain
a proportion of the Monument portfolio, which it says are "higher
quality accounts."


Last month, Barclays outlined plans for a merger with Dutch peer
ABN Amro but stopped short of announcing a formal takeover offer.


A deal would create the world's sixth-biggest bank capitalised at
approximately 162 billion dollars.


Investment fund TCI, an ABN shareholder, has tried to spark a
bidding war for the Dutch lender, inviting other banks to come
forward with offers.
