President George W. Bush on Wednesday welcomed the release by
Iran of 15 British naval personnel, captured almost two weeks ago
in the Gulf.


"As Prime Minister Blair said, President Bush also welcomes the
news," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.


The US administration has stayed in the background in the affair
leaving British Prime Minister Tony Blair to deal with the
situation, anxious not to complicate things.


But Bush did however denounce the capture of the group as
"indefensible" and said he and Blair had agreed "that there
should be no quid pro quos when it comes to the hostages."


This appeared to rule out any deal with Tehran to swap the
British sailors and marines for five Iranians captured by US
forces in northern Iraq in January.


However, the latest developments coincided with the release in
Baghdad of an Iranian diplomat kidnapped in Iraq in early
February. Iran had blamed US forces in the country for the
abduction.


Iranian state media also said earlier Wednesday that five Iranian
officials captured by US forces in northern Iraq in January and
accused of seeking to stir trouble were expected to receive their
first visit by an Iranian diplomat.
