Emanuele Filiberto, grandson of the last king of Italy, said
Wednesday he had not ruled out a career in politics.


Speaking at a meeting in Udine, northeastern Italy, he told the
ANSA news agency: "For the moment I am not thinking of being a
candidate but if tomorrow I see that I can be useful in politics,
why not?


"But it would only be if I can do something concrete because I
don't like to waste my time," said the 34-year-old.


Until as recently as 2002, the male descendants of King Victor
Emmanuel III were banished from Italian soil, because of the
king's collaboration with dictator Benito Mussolini and his anti-
Jewish laws during the 1922-1943 fascist era.


An Italian court is currently investigating Filiberto's father,
Prince Vittorio Emanuele, over his alleged involvement in a vast
pimping and illegal gaming network.
