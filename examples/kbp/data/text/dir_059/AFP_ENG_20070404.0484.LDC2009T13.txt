US PGA Tour event winners will once more receive invitations to
the Masters starting next week, Augusta National Golf Club
chairman Billy Payne announced here Wednesday.


On the eve of the 71st Masters, Payne said the qualifying changes
that begin for the 2008 tournament would retain the intimacy of
the event and still allow for a strong field.


Winners of US PGA regular-season and playoff events that apply
full points toward the season-ending US PGA Tour Championship
will receive an automatic spot in the Masters, starting with next
week's Heritage Classic.


"It was an exciting component of golf that only the Masters could
offer and we thought it appropriate that we brought it back,"
Payne said.


Reductions in qualifiers from money lists will open the door for
the likely larger number of players without making the field too
much larger.


Winners of the seven events following the Tour Championship,
mainly to determine the final money rankings to qualify for the
next year's tour, would not be included.


"We're trying to identify the best players in the world and at
the same time keep the field size within a manageable number,"
Payne said. "Opening up the qualification any further than the
Tour Championship puts those numbers at risk."
