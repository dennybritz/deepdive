US President George W. Bush will host Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe for dinner in Washington and at Camp David late this
month, the White House announced Wednesday.


The April 26-27 visit will mark Abe's first to the United States
as prime minister.


The two "will review the continuing strong cooperation on
bilateral alliance matters and on economic relations," national
security spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters as Bush
traveled to California.
