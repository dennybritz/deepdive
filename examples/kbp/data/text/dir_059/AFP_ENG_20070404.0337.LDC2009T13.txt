The brother of one of the 15 British sailors and marines detained
in Iran hailed Wednesday the announcement of their release by
Iran's president as "brilliant news."


"It's been a long, long 13 days," Nick Summers, brother of
captive Nathan Summers, told Sky News after the unexpected
announcement by Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran.
