Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Wednesday that a visit
by US House speaker Nancy Pelosi which angered the White House
showed that dialogue was essential between the two countries, the
state-run news agency SANA said.


"President Assad confirmed to Mrs Pelosi and her delegation that
their visit to Syria carries a clear message that dialogue and
peace are the joint language between peoples," SANA said.


"Direct dialogue is aimed at clarifying many realities and
correcting key issues that are of concern to the two countries
and regional security," Assad told Pelosi, SANA said.


He likewise "renewed Syria's attachment to peace" which he
described as a "strategic option", SANA said.


Assad and Pelosi also discussed the crises in war-torn
neighbouring Iraq and insisted that Syria "is attached to the
unity and independence of Iraq, as well as achieving security and
stability" in the country, SANA said.


This must be done "through comprehensive national unity and a
timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops," from Iraq, the
agency added.


US President George W. Bush has slammed Pelosi's visit to Syria
as giving "mixed signals" that undermine his administration's
efforts to isolate Assad.
