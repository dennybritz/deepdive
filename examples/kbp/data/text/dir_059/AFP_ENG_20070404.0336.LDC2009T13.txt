Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I've given my heart and my soul for 17 years. No coach had
mentioned even in passing that my attitude was not correct."


- Sachin Tendulkar hitting back at suggestions that coach Greg
Chappell,  who quit on Wednesday, blamed the poor approach of
India's senior professionals for their shock World Cup first
round exit.


"I've never minded the criticism. There are some lines you don't
cross, and some did when it came to that issue. I know who they
are, and I'll remember that in future."


- Veteran South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis on his
detractors.


"The thing he's done is push everyone in the team from Murali to
Sanath to myself to the youngest player in the camp, he has
pushed us not to stay in our comfort zones and push ourselves to
see what's out there."


- Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene on the influence of
Australian coach Tom Moody.


"He's been brilliant. He's working harder, he's enjoying his
cricket and he played some really good innings. He keeps going,
that's the character of the guy."


- Jayawardene on evergreen Sanath Jayasuriya who has become the
most capped one- day player of all time.


"We worked very hard on our players and we worked very hard on
our opposition. After 18 months, it's quite nice to be number
one. To come from fifth to nunber one is something we are
extremely proud of."


- South Africa coach Mickey Arthur on his team's rise to the
world number one spot.
