Rwandan Hutu rebels have intensified their attacks in the eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo, killing three and kidnapping dozens
in recent days, the UN mission here said Wednesday.


Fourteen attacks occurred last week in the Walungu and Kabare
areas in raids by the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation
of Rwanda), said Kemal Saiki, spokesperson for the UN mission in
the DR Congo.


Another 72 people were kidnapped and several rapes were reported.


Residents of those areas, where DR Congo military forces have
previously been deployed, told the AFP by phone that the attacks
had continued this week.


"We are asking the authorities to reinforce the military presence
in those zones, where massacres and kidnappings have risen in
recent days," said Oscar Zihalirwa of Walungu.


Rwandan Hutu fighters have been present in the forest and
mountains of eastern DR Congo since the mid-1990s.


Some of the rebels are accused of having participated in the
Rwandan genocide in 1994. Some 800,000 people, most of them
ethnic Tutsis, were killed within six weeks in Rwanda in 1994 by
members of the Hutu ethnic group.


The international community considers their presence in the DR
Congo as one of the main threats to stability in the region,
though they have been weakened in recent years by division and
desertions.
