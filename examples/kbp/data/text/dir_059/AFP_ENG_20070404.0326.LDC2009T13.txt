British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office said
Wednesday it was "looking at" comments by Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in which he announced the immediate release
of 15 sailors.


"We are looking at what has been said," said a spokesman,
declining to give any further immediate reaction.
