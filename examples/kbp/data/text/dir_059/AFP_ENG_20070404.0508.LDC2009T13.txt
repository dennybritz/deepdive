Liverpool's joy at virtually ensuring they would reach the
Champions League semi-finals after a 3-0 first leg away win over
PSV Eindhoven was dampened on Wednesday by the news that defender
Fabio Aurelio would miss the rest of the season.


The 27-year-old Brazilian international defender - the first from
his country to sign for the club - ruptured his Achilles tendon
during the second-half of the match.


"A scan has confirmed a complete rupture of the Achilles tendon
in Fabio's right leg," said a Liverpool spokesman.


"The player will undergo surgery and is expected to be out for
approximately three to four months."


Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said it was a real shame for the
player because he had just started to adapt really well to the
Premiership.


"Fabio has started to play really well, this is a very bad blow
for him and us," said Benitez, who signed Aurelio from his former
club Valencia and with whom he had landed a Spanish title.


"There was nobody anywhere near him, he felt as if he had been
hit by a stone. The pain was from behind and it struck him like
he had been hit, it is a real tragedy for us.


"We played well and it was an organised, effective performance
but we are all more concerned about Fabio."
