Fast bowler Stuart Broad is to replace seamer Jon Lewis in
England's World Cup squad, it was announced here Wednesday.


Lewis - who has not played in the tournament proper - is set to
return home to be with his wife, who is experiencing
complications in pregnancy, an England spokesman said.


Broad, 20, has played five one-day internationals since making
his England debut last year.


The son of former England opening batsman Chris and the current
Young Cricketer of the Year in England, Leicestershire's Broad
was involved in England A's recent tour of Bangladesh.
