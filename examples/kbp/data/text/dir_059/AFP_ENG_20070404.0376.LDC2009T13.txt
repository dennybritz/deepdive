Slower growth was seen in the US service sector in March as the
cooler expansion pace extended to a wide segment of the economy,
a survey by the Institute of Supply Management showed Wednesday.


The ISM said its nonmanufacturing index fell to 52.4 percent from
54.3 percent a month earlier.


The figure was weaker than the 54.7 percent expected by Wall
Street but ahead of the 50 percent which signifies expansion.


The ISM report suggests sluggish growth in services, which make
up the bulk of activity in the world's largest economy.


"The overall indication in March is continued economic growth in
the non- manufacturing sector, but at a slower pace than in
February," said ISM survey chief Anthony Nieves.


"Members' comments in March indicate a concern with fuel costs,
the economy and the impact on business conditions."


Nieves noted that the survey marked the 48th consecutive month of
expansion in February.


The sub-indexes in the report were generally mixed, but most were
above 50 percent.


The prices index, a gauge of inflation pressures, jumped to 63.3
percent from 53.8 percent.


The index for new orders fell to 53.8 percent from 54.8 percent a
month earlier, and the employment index slipped to 50.8 percent
from 52.2 percent.


The latest report was roughly in line with the ISM index of
national industrial activity, which fell to 50.9 percent in
March, also showing decelerating growth.
