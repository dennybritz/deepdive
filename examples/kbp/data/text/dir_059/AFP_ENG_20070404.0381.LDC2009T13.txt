A "ceremony" for the release of the 15 British sailors has begun,
an Iranian official said on Wednesday after President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad announced they would be freed.


Bijan Nobaveh, a veteran Iranian journalist moderating the news
conference, invited reporters at the conference in the
presidential compound in southern Tehran to transfer to another
room to meet the naval personnel.


"The ceremony is ongoing. For photographers and cameramen who
want to cover it, they can go," he said.


However AFP reporters present at the news conference said there
was still no sign of the ceremony starting in the presidential
compound and there was still confusion about where exactly the
ceremony was being held.
