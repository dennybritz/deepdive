Here is the text of British Prime Minister Tony Blair's statement
outside his Downing Street office in London on Iran's release of
15 British naval personnel Wednesday:


"I'm glad that our 15 service personnel have been released. I
know that their release will come as a profound relief not just
to them but to their families that have endured such distress and
anxiety over these past 12 days.


"Throughout we have taken a measured approach: firm but calm, not
negotiating but not confronting either.


"I would like to thank our allies in Europe, our allies in the
United Nations Security Council for their support and also our
friends and allies in the region who played their part.


"We are grateful to all of them as we are to the officials in the
Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence and here in Downing
Street for the work that they have done.


"And to the Iranian people I would simply say this: we bear you
no ill will. On the contrary, we respect Iran as an ancient
civilisation, as a nation with a proud and dignified history.


"And the disagreements that we have with your government we wish
to resolve peacefully through dialogue.


"I hope, as I have always hoped, that in the future we are able
to do so."
