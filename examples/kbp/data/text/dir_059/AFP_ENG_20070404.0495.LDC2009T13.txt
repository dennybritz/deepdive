Challengers to Alinghi's America's Cup crown caught a glimpse of
what they were up against when the Swiss champions won
Wednesday's two regattas at the final preliminary heats staged
here for the Louis-Vuitton Cup.


Staged in testing, blustery conditions Alinghi's boat, SUI 91
coped best with the testing wind to lead Spain's Desafio Espanol
across the line in the morning's second race.


Team New Zealand took third.


There was misfortune for the Chinese challenger China Team which
trailed in last after the boom snapped allowing the mainsail to
sky up in the air, billowing and uncontrolled.


Alinghi was on form again later in the third regatta, seeing off
Italy's Luna Rossa with Desafio Espanol this time in third but
there was disappointment for the + 39 Challenge team.


The Italian boat's new mast came crashing down and she had to
pull out at the same stage as United Internet Team Germany.


Act 13 is the final preliminary leg in which Alinghi's 11
challengers gain bonus points ahead of the Louis Vuitton Cup
(April 16-May 7).


The Louis-Vuitton winner earns the right to take on Alinghi in
the 32nd America's Cup best of nine race match in June.


While her challengers have plenty of action ahead, Act 13, which
concludes on Friday, is the last time Alinghi, from landlocked
Switzerland, will race in anger ahead of the defence of her title
captured in Auckland Bay in New Zealand four years ago.
