Britain welcomed Wednesday the unexpected announcement that its
15 sailors and marines held by Iran would be released, a
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair told AFP.


"We welcome what the president has said about the release of our
15 personnel. We are now trying to establish exactly what this
means in terms of the method and timing of their release," he
said.


Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Wednesday announced that
the group would be freed after two weeks in captivity during a
dramatic news conference in Tehran.


"After the news conference they can go to the airport and go back
home," Ahmadinejad said. "They will be going back home today."


"While insisting on our rights, these 15 sailors have been
pardoned and we offer their freedom to the British people,"
Ahmadinejad said.


The release was welcome by relatives of some of the detainees --
Nick Summers, brother of Nathan Summers, told Sky News: "It's
been a long, long 13 days".


The brother of Adam Sperry, another captive, added: "I've just
told my mum and she's really chuffed."


The 14 men and one woman from the frigate Cornwall were captured
on March 23 in the northern Gulf after inspecting a freighter.
Iran insisted they were in its waters, but Britain said they were
on the Iraqi side.
