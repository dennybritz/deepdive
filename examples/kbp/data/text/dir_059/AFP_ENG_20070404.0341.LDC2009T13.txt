Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg criticised on
Wednesday Spain's decision to patch up diplomatic ties with
Cuba's communist regime.


"The Czech Republic has a different long term opinion to that of
Spain when it comes to dealing with the Cuban regime," said
Schwarzenberg.


"There is not a change in Czech policy towards Cuba. The question
of human rights constitutes one of the foreign policy priorities
for the Czech Republic," Schwarzenberg said in a statement.


In May 2005 Schwarzenberg was one of several European lawmakers
who were expelled from Cuba as they arrived to attend a congress
of Cuban political dissidents.


On Tuesday, Cuba and Spain signed an agreement creating a
mechanism for political consultation, including on the sensitive
issue of human rights, during a visit by Spanish Foreign Minister
Miguel Angel Moratinos.


Madrid has spearheaded efforts to revive European Union relations
with Cuba, after Havana jailed 75 dissidents four years ago.


As one half of Czechoslokia, the Czech Republic was under Soviet
rule from after WWII until 1989, since when it has been at the
forefront of attacking human rights abuses under Cuban leader
Fidel Castro.


In December the former anti-communist dissident turned president
Vaclav Havel urged tourists to shun the Caribbean island as a
holiday destination.


"I cannot go to Cuba to lounge on the beach and pretend not to
notice anything while there are dozens of political prisoners
behind bars," Havel said at a dissidents' conference in Warsaw.
