The price of gold is set to beat its record average annual high
of 614.50 dollars an ounce in 2007 as investment buying grows,
the precious metals consultancy GFMS said on Wednesday.


"It's looking pretty certain that the record in terms of the
annual average, 614.50 dollars back in 1980, is going to fall
this year," GFMS chairman Philip Klapwijk said as the independent
research group published its annual Gold Survey.


Since the start of 2007 gold has traded at a average of 650
dollars an ounce.


"I'd also be far from surprised if this year we saw the market
moving above the 2006 high of 725 dollars," added Klapwijk.


On May 12 last year, an ounce of gold hit a fixing price of
725.75 dollars on the London Bullion Market, which was the
highest level for more than 26 years.


"Quite whether we'd then get close to the all time high of 850
dollars (in 2007) is more doubtful, but I'd certainly expect the
upward price trend to continue on into 2008," Klapwijk said.


Investors are piling into gold amid geopolitical concerns, since
the yellow metal is seen as a safe store of value in times of
higher inflation and political tensions.


Gold has won renewed support in recent weeks owing to Iran's
standoff with Britain over the 15 British sailors captured by
Tehran nearly a fortnight ago.


Investors are also being drawn to gold because of the long-
standing row between Western powers and Iran over the Islamic
Republic's disputed nuclear programme.
