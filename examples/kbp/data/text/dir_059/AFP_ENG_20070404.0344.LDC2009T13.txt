Britain welcomed Wednesday the unexpected announcement that its
15 sailors and marines held by Iran would be released, a
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair told AFP.


"We welcome what the president (of Iran) has said about the
release of our 15 personnel. We are now trying to establish
exactly what this means in terms of the method and timing of
their release," he said.
