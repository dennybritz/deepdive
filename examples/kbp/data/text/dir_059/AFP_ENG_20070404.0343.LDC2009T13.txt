Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Wednesday announced that
the 15 British sailors captured by Iran will be freed immediately
after his news conference and can go straight to the airport.


"After the news conference they can go to the airport and go back
home," Ahmadinehad told his ongoing news conference. "They will
be going back home today."


"While insisting on our rights, these 15 sailors have been
pardoned and we offer their freedom to the British people,"
Ahmadinejad said.


"Although Iran has the right to prosecute them by following the
model of the Prophet, the 15 people were pardoned and their
freedom given as a gift to the British people," he added.


A British embassy spokesman in Tehran declined to comment on
whether the announcement had taken London by surprise. "We are
following up the details now," he said.


Ahmadinejad, referring to a string of televised "confessions" by
the sailors, said "I ask (British Prime Minister Tony) Mr Blair
not to judge the military personnel for the truths that they
said.


"I ask Mr Blair, instead of reinforcing international tensions
and modernising Britain's nuclear weapons and occupying other
countries, to return to justice and morality."


He also criticised Blair for the fact that the sole female
detainee, Faye Turney, was even serving in the armed forces.


"Among the British who were arrested, there was a women who was
the mother of a child. Why do they give such missions to a woman
who is the mother of a child to patrol the sea?"
