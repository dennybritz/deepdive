A British policeman who is learning Lithuanian to give immigrants
a helping hand will be honoured in the Baltic state for his
efforts, award ceremony organisers said Wednesday.


Gary Pettengell, 41, is to receive the Pride of Lithuania title
at a gala ceremony in Vilnius Thursday, said the commercial
television channel TV3, which sponsors the annual awards.


The Pride of Lithuania awards have been issued for the past three
years.


Previous winners include President Valdas Adamkus and Lithuania's
European Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaite.


Pettengell was nominated in the Benefactor of the Year category
by a Lithuanian community association in the seaside town of
Great Yarmouth, in the eastern English county of Norfolk.


Besides teaching himself the rudiments of Lithuanian, he was one
of the people behind the website www.welcometonorfolk.org.uk,
which has information in English and Lithuanian, as well as
Polish, Portuguese and Russian.


The site aims to help migrants to Great Yarmouth and the rest of
the region get to grips with anything from finding a job or
opening a bank account to reporting a crime to the police.


About 600 Lithuanians live in Great Yarmouth, which has a total
population of 90,000.


Like other citizens of the former communist bloc countries that
joined the European Union in 2004, Lithuanians often work in the
town's tourist industry as well as Norfolk's farm sector.


Between 50,000 and 100,000 Lithuanians are believed to be living
and working in Britain, a substantial slice of their homeland's
population of 3.4 million.
