An Italian man on a religious pilgrimage in northern Spain spent
the night lost in snow protected only by a sleeping bag before
being found by rescuers, officials said Wednesday.


He was taken to hospital in the town of Burguete where he was
treated for hypothermia, the regional government of Navarre said
in a statement.


The 54-year-old man used his mobile telephone to call Spanish
emergency services around midnight on Tuesday to report he had
lost his bearings near the town of Roncesvalles shortly after he
crossed over the French border by foot.


He was found some eight hours later following an extensive search
involving police and firefighters, the statement said.


Heavy snowfall, with accumulations of between 50 and 100
centimetres (20 to 40 inches), made the search difficult, it
added.


The man, who was on a Catholic pilgrimage along the Way of St.
James, remained in contact with rescuers until around 5:00 am
when the battery of his mobile telephone ran out.


The pilgrimage route, often known by its Spanish name "el Camino
de Santiago", attracts thousands of visitors each year,
especially during the summer months.


Its final destination is the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela
in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where the remains of the
apostle, Saint James the Great, are said to be buried.
