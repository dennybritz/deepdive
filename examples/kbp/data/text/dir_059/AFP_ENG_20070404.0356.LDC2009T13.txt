The White House on Wednesday said it was "monitoring the
situation closely" but had no immediate comment on Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's announcement that the 15 British
naval personnel captured by Iran would be freed.


"We are following the situation closely," said spokeswoman Dana
Perino.


President George W. Bush had said Iran's seizure of 15 British
sailors and marines was "inexcusable behavior" and he opposed any
"quid pro quos" to get them back.
