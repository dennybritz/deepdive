Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer called on Wednesday for a
quick and limited debate on how to take the European Union's
moribund constitutional project forward.


"We don't think that it's useful or necessary to start from the
very beginning," he told reporters in Brussels after talks with
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.


"The debate about adaptation should be a very limited one in
order to fulfill the timetable to have a renewed basis for the
European Union (by) the parliamentary elections in 2009," he
said.


At a summit in Berlin on March 25, EU leaders endorsed a plan to
define a new treaty to replace the constitution before the next
European Parliament elections are held in 2009.


The constitution, meant to simplify the way the EU operates as it
expands,  has been in political limbo since it was rejected by
French and Dutch voters in referendums in mid-2005.


German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country currently holds
the EU's rotating presidency, aims to produce a "roadmap" by June
to lead the bloc out of its institutional malaise.


Portugal, which takes over the EU's reins in July, is then likely
to host an inter-governmental conference aimed at defining a new
treaty, probably made up of many pieces of the constitutional
project.
