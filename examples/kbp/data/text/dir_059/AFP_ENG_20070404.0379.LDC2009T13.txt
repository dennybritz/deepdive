Sri Lanka were 44-1 after 10 overs of their World Cup Super
Eights match against England at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium
here Wednesday.


Upal Tharanga was on 15 with Kumar Sangakkara on two.


Sanath Jayasuriya, making a word record 385th one-day appearance,
was the first man out bowled by Sajid Mahmood for 25 in the
eighth over with the score on 37.


England skipper Michael Vaughan won the toss and elected to
field.


Sri Lanka were unchanged from the side that beat West Indies by
113 runs on Sunday and England went in with the same team that
defeated Ireland by 48 runs on Friday.


Sri Lanka, the 1996 champions, currently have four points to lie
third in the Super Eights and England only two after losing to
fellow qualifiers New Zealand in the group stage.
