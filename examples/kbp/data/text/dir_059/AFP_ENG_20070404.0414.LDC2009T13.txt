Sri Lanka announced Wednesday a crackdown on cruelty to bulls at
chariot races during next week's Buddhist New Year celebrations.


Bull-cart races are popular during the island's traditional two-
day festivities, which start April 13, but animal rights
activists say drivers treat the animals badly.


Bulls are usually pulled by the testicles or the tail and kicked
by drivers, who guide the animals with reins threaded through
their nostrils.


Activists say such events should not be seen by children. People
turn out in large numbers and place bets on the bulls.


President Mahinda Rajapakse's office said the authorities
encouraged the public to report such races to the police.


"All police personnel have been instructed to prevent the
incidence of cruelty to cart bulls," the president's office said
in a statement.


Offenders could face a fine under laws which were drawn up more
than 100 years ago during Britain's occupation, which ended in
1948.
