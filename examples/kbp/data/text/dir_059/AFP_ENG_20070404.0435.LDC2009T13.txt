At least 47 people were killed and more than 700 injured in car
accidents during the last week alone in Algeria, police said on
Wednesday.


Algeria has the fourth-highest number of deaths worldwide from
road accidents and more than any other Arab nation.


Police said the accidents between March 28 and April 3 were due
to speeding, loss of control, poor overtaking, negligent
pedestrians and not keeping enough of a distance from other
vehicles.


The number of people killed in road accidents in the country rose
15 percent in 2006, resulting in nearly 3,400 deaths.


Last year's 24,000 accidents also accounted for more than 41,000
injuries, including 3,000 people left disabled for life, police
said.


They cost the state 100 billion dinars (more than one billion
euros, about 1.3 billion dollars) in emergency-related services,
police said.
