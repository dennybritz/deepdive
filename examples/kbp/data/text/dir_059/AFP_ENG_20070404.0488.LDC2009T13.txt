A Taliban spokesman said Wednesday the movement had captured two
French aid workers who have not been in contact with their
organisation for nearly two days.


"We have seized two foreigners and three Afghans -- two of them
interpreters, one of them a driver -- on the road between Nimroz
and Farah," said Yousuf Ahmadi, the Taliban spokesman.


"They are in our custody now and our leadership will decide their
fate."
