The White House on Wednesday said it was "monitoring the
situation closely" but had no immediate comment on Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's announcement that the 15 British
naval personnel captured by Iran would be freed.


"We are following the situation closely," said spokeswoman Dana
Perino.


President George W. Bush had said Iran's seizure of 15 British
sailors and marines was "inexcusable behavior" and he opposed any
"quid pro quos" to get them back.


Ahmadinejad announced on Wednesday that 15 British sailors
captured almost two weeks ago in the Gulf had been pardoned and
would be freed imminently as "a gift."


His surprise pledge at a much-anticipated news conference in
Tehran was quickly welcomed by Downing Street and the brother of
one of the 15 detained sailors and marines.


"Although Iran has the right to prosecute them, by following the
model of the prophet the 15 people were pardoned and their
freedom given as a gift to the British people," Ahmadinejad said.


He said the 14 men and one woman, some of whom had been paraded
several times on state television "confessing" to trespassing in
Iranian waters, would be freed after the press conference and
taken straight to the airport.


"After the news conference they can go to the airport and go back
home," Ahmadinejad said. "They will be going back home today."


A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed the
unexpected announcement while Nick Summers, the brother of one
captive Nathan Summers, said it was "brilliant news."


"It's been a long, long 13 days," he told Britain's Sky News.
