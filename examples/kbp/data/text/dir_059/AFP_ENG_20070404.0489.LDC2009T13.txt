Police arrested more than two dozen bikers and their associates
in simultaneous pre-dawn raids on clubhouses, homes and
businesses in three Canadian provinces Wednesday, authorities
told AFP.


In downtown Toronto, police punched a hole in the outside wall of
a fortified Hells Angels clubhouse to gain access, according to
television reports.


"It was a huge operation," Constable Pam Higham said. "There were
raids in Ontario and two other locations. More than two dozen
bikers and their associates were arrested on drugs and weapons
charges."


"We removed an element of society that people do not want."


The investigation of the Hells Angels and Bacchus Motorcycle Club
started about 18 months ago, and included almost a dozen police
agencies, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canada
Border Services Agency, Higham said.


Weapons and drugs, including date rape drug GHB (Gamma hydroxy
butyrate) and cocaine, were seized, she said.


"Bikers, they try to make themselves look like they are kind,
outstanding, wonderful citizens, when in essence it is organized
crime," Higham told public broadcaster CBC.
