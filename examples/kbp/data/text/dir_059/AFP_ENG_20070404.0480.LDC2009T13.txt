British Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed Wednesday the release of
15 detainees by Iran, saying London wanted to peacefully resolve
disputes with Tehran.


"The disagreements we have with your government we wish to
resolve peacefully," he said in comments directed to the Iranian
people, following the announcement of the Britons' release in
Tehran. "We bear you no ill will."
