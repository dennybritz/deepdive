Eurostar said Friday it was suspending all services between
London and continental Europe for 24 hours due to a track-side
fire in the British capital.


The passenger train company said there was a risk of gas
cylinders exploding following the blaze near an inner-city
commuter train station. Some 11,000 people expected to travel on
Eurostar Friday night would be affected, it added.
