A 23-year-old man appeared in court on Friday charged with
murdering an Anglican vicar in the grounds of his church earlier
this week.


Geraint David Evans is alleged to have stabbed to death Father
Paul Bennett outside Saint Fagan's Church in the village of
Trecynon, near Aberdare, south Wales, on Wednesday afternoon.


The 59-year-old churchman's death rocked the close-knit local
community and prompted tributes from the Archbishop of Wales and
the leader of the world's Anglican communion, Archbishop of
Canterbury Rowan Williams.


Evans spoke only to confirm his name and address during the brief
hearing at Aberdare Magistrates' Court and was remanded into
custody until an administrative hearing at Merthyr Crown Court on
March 23.


Britain's strict contempt of court laws mean few details of the
case can be reported ahead of any trial.
