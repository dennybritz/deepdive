An Irish consortium has paid 38.6 million dollars to build an
"Ireland in the Sun" in the "World" development of artificial
islands off the coast of Dubai, reports said on Friday.


Investors John O'Dolan, Noel Connellan, Ray Norton and Andrew
Brett plan to build "a 225,000 sq ft resort with a collection of
homes, apartments, restaurants and retail amidst beaches, boating
and leisure opportunities" with an Irish flavour, developers
Nakheel said.


They unveiled their purchase ahead of St Patrick's Day on
Saturday.


"We are delighted that Ireland will be developed with a distinct
Irish theme reflecting the culture and heritage of Ireland," said
the development's general manager, Hamza Mustafa.


Investor John O'Dolan said: "We look forward to developing
Ireland which will provide the Irish homeowner with their very
own place they can call home in the sun."


Ireland was the ninth of the 300 or so artificial islands
representing the world map that developers Nakheel had sold so
far this year.


The firm has now sold some 40 percent of the land that will be
created by the huge project.


The mosaic of islands lies some four kilometres (two and a half
miles) off the coast of Dubai, and covers some nine kilometres by
seven kilometres. The development -- more than 9.5 million square
metres in all -- is visible to the naked eye from space.


It is one of a series of huge real-estate projects Dubai is
building as part of its efforts to become the region's main
tourism and leisure hub.
