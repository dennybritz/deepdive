The World Wildlife Fund on Friday warned consumers against buying
Spanish strawberries, whose cultivation is having a
"catastrophic" impact on wetlands in the south of the country.


"By buying Spanish strawberries -- on sale in supermarkets from
January to April -- you are supporting the destruction of the
Iberian natural milieu because the impact of this cultivation on
the environment is catastrophic," WWF's Paris office said.


Some 95 percent of Spanish strawberries are grown on an area of
5,000 hectares (12,300 acres) around the Coto Donana national
park, which is on the UNESCO world heritage list, WWF said.


Irrigation of the farms has reduced flows of fresh water to the
Donana marshes by 50 percent and is draining one of the European
Union's most important wet zones, WWF said.


Some 40 percent of the farms and 50 percent of the bore holes
that feed them have no authorisation, the organisation said.


"The production is also highly pollutant, resulting in 4,500
tonnes of plastic waste every year and still using a pesticide
which is banned in the EU (bromomethane)," it said.


Some 330,000 tonnes of strawberries are produced in Spain every
year, of which more than half are exported. Germany and France
are the largest importers.
