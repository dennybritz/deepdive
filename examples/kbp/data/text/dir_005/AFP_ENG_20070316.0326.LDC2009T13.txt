Foreign and Cambodian judges reached Friday an agreement on
procedures governing Cambodia's genocide trials, its officials
said.


A major obstacle remains, however, over the role of international
defence lawyers, the officials said.


The row over defence counsel threatens to sink the long-stalled
tribunal to try former Khmer Rouge leaders, with foreign judges
saying that a requirement that foreign lawyers pay fees to
participate in the trials is "unacceptable"


"(Fees) severely limits the rights of accused and victims to
select counsel of their choice," a statement released at the end
of talks said.


The judges were meeting for the third time to negotiate the
procedures, which govern every aspect of the tribunal and are
necessary for the trials to go forward.


The first public hearings were expected this year, but repeated
delays mean trials will not likely start until early 2008,
officials say.
