Eleven contenders are set to run in the French presidential
election after meeting the deadline on Friday to submit the 500
endorsements necessary to qualify as a candidate.


A question mark hung over farmer-activist Jose Bove as a possible
12th candidate after he said he may be four or five signatures
short of the number required to get his name on the ballot.


"According to our calculations, we should have the 500
signatures, but we don't have the official confirmation," Bove
told a news conference, saying his candidacy hinged on "four or
five signatures that could go either way."


Under rules designed to weed out frivolous candidacies,
challengers for the French presidency must have the public
backing of 500 out of some 42,000 elected officials, including
the country's 36,500 mayors.


The signed forms had to be presented at the Paris offices of the
Constitutional Council, the body that supervises the election, by
6:00 pm (1700 GMT) Friday.


The Council will verify the signatures over the weekend and
announce an official list of candidates on Monday, four weeks
ahead of the first round of voting on April 22.  A second round
between the two top vote-getters is scheduled for May 6.
