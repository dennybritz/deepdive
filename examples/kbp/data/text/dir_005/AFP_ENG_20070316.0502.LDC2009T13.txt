European football's governing body UEFA on Friday opened
disciplinary proceedings against Bayern Munich's Oliver Kahn and
Lucio, accusing the pair of "improper behaviour" during a doping
test.


"UEFA have accused the Bayern Munich goalkeeper of improper
conduct during a doping test which was carried out after the
Champions League last sixteen match against Real Madrid last
week," UEFA announced in a statement.


UEFA's disciplinary committee will examine the case on March 22.
