German police said on Friday they have arrested alleged Serb
crime boss Andrija Draskovic, who has been linked to the
assassination of Serb militia leader Arkan.


Draskovic, believed to be one of the leading figures of the crime
underworld in the former Yugoslavia, was arrested at Frankfurt
airport last Sunday under an international warrant issued by an
Italian court, police said.


The 42-year-old is wanted in Italy for smuggling vast amounts of
cigarettes from Montenegro to Bari in southern Italy in the
1990s.


A Frankfurt court is due to rule on his extradition to Italy. A
justice spokesman said the process could take up to four weeks.


He is suspected of plotting the killing in 2000 of Zeljko
Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, whose Tigers militia conducted
a reign of terror in Bosnia and Serbia.


Draskovic survived an assassination attempt in Belgrade in 2004
and was believed to be living in the Croatian seaside resort of
Opatija.
