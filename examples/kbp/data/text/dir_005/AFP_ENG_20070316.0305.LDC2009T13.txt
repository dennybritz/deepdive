New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming won the toss and elected to
field in the World Cup Group C match against England at
Beausejour here on Friday.


Early moring rain delayed the start but play was expected to get
underway at 1000 local time (1400GMT).


England picked injured quick James Anderson for the match.


The Lancashire fast bowler was named on the team sheet despite
the injury to the little finger of his right hand suffered during
catching practice on Wednesday.
