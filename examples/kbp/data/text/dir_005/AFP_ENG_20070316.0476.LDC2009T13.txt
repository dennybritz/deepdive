Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo
reiterated their commitment on Friday to end rebel activities in
the war-ravaged Great Lakes region.


Following a meeting in the Rwandan capital Kigali, ministers from
the four countries promised to maintain "political, diplomatic
and military strategies for ending the regional security threats
from negative forces."


In a statement, they pledged to draw up new laws and procedures
to deal with those responsible for conflict and to continue
sharing intelligence.


Army chiefs from the four countries are due to meet within a
month to decide a strategy against the armed gangs, the statement
from the so-called Tripartite Plus Commission added.


The commission was set up in 2004 to bring some security to the
region following a series of conflicts since the 1990s. The worst
was the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which the UN estimates about
800,000 people died.


Since then armed gangs have continued their attacks on civilians,
mostly to the east of the DRC.


When they last met in May 2006 at Kigali, the four countries drew
up a list of rebel leaders and armed gangs which they believed
should be subjected to United Nations and African Union
sanctions.


Friday's meeting was also attended by US Deputy Assistant
Secretary for African Affairs, James Swan.
