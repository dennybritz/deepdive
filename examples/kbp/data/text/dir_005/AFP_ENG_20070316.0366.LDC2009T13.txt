The United Nations said Friday that a critical shortage of funds
would force it to halve food rations for nearly 1.5 million
people displaced by war in Uganda from next month.


The UN World Food Programme (WFP) also warned of possible further
cuts in its school feeding programme and support to people with
HIV/AIDS.


"Until we have sufficient funds to buy food locally, we will be
forced from April 1 to reduce by half the amount of maize and
beans that we give to each displaced and refugee family in
Uganda," WFP Uganda Country Director Tesema Negash said in
statement.


"If we don't cut them by 50 percent in the next few weeks, the
relief operation would grind to a halt in May."


More than 230,000 displaced people returned home in northern
Uganda in 2006 with WFP assistance, but 1.28 million remain
trapped in squalid camps in northern districts, where they
largely depend on WFP food relief, the agency said.


"Even though the security situation in northern Uganda has
improved and the peace process with the (rebel) Lord's Resistance
Army (LRA) is moving ahead, the humanitarian needs of the people
remain considerable," Negash added.


Uganda's conflict has raged since 1988, when the elusive LRA
leader Joseph Kony took leadership of a two-year-old regional
rebellion among northern Uganda's ethnic Acholi minority.
