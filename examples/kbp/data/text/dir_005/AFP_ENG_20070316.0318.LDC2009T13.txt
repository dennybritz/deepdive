Umpires will have another inspection of the Warner Park pitch
after the World Cup Group A match between South Africa and the
Netherlands was further delayed here on Friday.


Overnight rain left the outfield wet and the groundsmen were busy
trying to dry it out.


The two umpires, Mark Benson of England and Tony Hill of New
Zealand, made an inspection of the pitch and outfield and ruled
out an immediate start.


They will have another inspection at 10:30 am (1430 GMT).


Defending champions Australia beat Scotland by 203 runs in the
opening match of the group here on Wednesday.
