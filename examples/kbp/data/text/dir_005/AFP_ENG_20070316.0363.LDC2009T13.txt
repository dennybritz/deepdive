Syria on Friday welcomed the latest interim report by the UN
commission of inquiry into the 2005 murder of former Lebanese
prime minister Rafiq Hariri, describing it as "professional."


"The report is professional, technical and does not preempt the
outcome of the inquiry," Syria's ambassador to the United
Nations, Bashar Jaafari, told the government daily Ath-Thawra.


"It does not make definitive findings. It underlines that Syria
is continuing to give its support to the commission, which is
satisfied with the logistical and security arrangements made by
the Syrian authorities," Jaafari added.


The UN panel, headed by Belgian judge Serge Brammertz, has been
investigating the February 2005 killing of Hariri and 22 others
in a massive bomb blast in Beirut for more than a year.


In its latest report released on Thursday, the commission
reported "progress in collecting new evidence" and described the
cooperation of the Syrian government in the investigation as
"satisfactory."


Syria's reaction to Brammertz's report was in sharp contrast to
those of his German predecessor Detlev Mehlis, who angered
Damascus by implicating a number of top officials and their
Lebanese allies by name.


The Syrians deny any involvement in Hariri's killing.
