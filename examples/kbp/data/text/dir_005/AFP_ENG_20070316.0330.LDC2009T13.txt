The northeast United States was battening down for a winter storm
Friday, with hundreds of flights canceled and up to 45
centimeters (18 inches) of snow forecast to fall.


Kevin Lipton, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service
in the eastern New York city of Albany, said the region was
expecting between 30 and 45 centimeters of snow while New York
City was forecast 20 centimeters Friday.


Despite much of the United States experiencing a mild winter so
far, Lipton said the flurries were not unusual.


"You get snow sometimes in late March, sometimes you get it in
April, we even have snow in May. In fact February and March are
usually the snowiest months here in the Albany area," he said.


"This is more normal than abnormal," he added.


Nevertheless, airlines canceled flights as a precaution, with
Delta and budget carrier JetBlue between them grounding almost
500 flights.


"The reason we do this is that pro-actively canceling flights
allows Delta to begin re-accommodating customers in advance of a
storm," said Delta spokesman Kent Landers.


"We've learned over time it ensures that we can minimize the
delay and cancellation impact throughout the storm."


JetBlue spokesman Bryan Baldwin said the airline had canceled
more than 200 flights as a precaution, mostly domestic services
into and out of New York's Kennedy airport, but expected traffic
to return to normal over the weekend.
