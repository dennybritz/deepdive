Five demonstrators and three police officers were wounded on
Friday during weekly protests against the West Bank barrier, army
radio reported.


Police used teargas grenades to disperse stone-throwing
demonstrators in the village of Bilin, north of Ramallah. Four
demonstrators were also arrested, the radio reported.


The farming village of Bilin is the site of weekly clashes
between protestors against the controversial barrier and police,
who regularly use tear gas, rubber bullets and batons against
demonstrators.


Israel says the 700 kilometre (435 mile) long barrier, made up of
concrete walls and razor wire fences, is necessary to protect the
Jewish state against terrorists.


Palestinians say the barrier is a land grab which eats up chunks
of their promised state, separates farmers from their land and
splits families.


The International Court of Justice, in a non-binding decision,
ruled the barrier illegal in 2004. Israel has pressed on with
construction, which is 65 percent finished.
