Umpires will have a third inspection of the conditions at Warner
Park after the World Cup Group A match between South Africa and
the Netherlands failed to start here on Friday.


The two umpires, Mark Benson of England and Tony Hill of New
Zealand, have made two inspections of the pitch and outfield
which was left wet after overnight and early morning rain.


"There are still some wet patches on the bowler's run-up so there
will be another inspection at 11:30 am (1530 GMT)," an official
said.


Defending champions Australia beat Scotland by 203 runs in the
opening match of the group on Wednesday.
