A suburb of the Dutch capital Amsterdam was rocked by an
explosion that destroyed the front of an apartment, the Dutch ANP
news agency reported Friday.


The explosion damaged the facade of the ninth-floor apartment in
an apartment complex on the Voorburgstraat in the western suburb
of Slotervaart. The Amsterdam fire brigade removed the facade to
prevent debris falling on the street below, ANP said.


It is unclear what caused the blast but the fire brigade said
there were no victims because the explosion happend when no-one
was home. No other apartments sustained any damage, according to
ANP.
