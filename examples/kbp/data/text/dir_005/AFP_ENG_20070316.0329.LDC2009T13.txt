Environment ministers from the Group of Eight industrialised
nations and five major emerging countries agreed on Friday to get
a detailed fix on the economic costs of biodiversity loss.


"We agreed on the need for a report on the economic cost of
biodiversity destruction, modelled on the Stern Report," German
Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel, chairing the two-day
meeting, said after the first session.


Gabriel referred to the headline-making report published last
October by British economist Sir Nicholas Stern, who estimated
that climate change could cost the equivalent of between five and
20 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) every year.


"We wanted to highlight the economic value of biodiversity and
also the dangers for our economic prosperity caused by
biodiversity loss," Gabriel said.


The G8 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Russia and the United States; the five big developing countries
were Brazil, China, India Mexico and South Africa.


Experts from industrialised and developing countries will be
tasked with writing the report, which will be put to the G8
summit in the Baltic Sea resort of Heiligendamm from June 6-8.


The Potsdam meeting, ending Saturday, also pledged closer
cooperation on identifying and monitoring invasive species and on
combatting the illegal trade in wild plants and animals.


The talks also aim to break the gridlock on how to tackle global
warming, caused overwhelmingly by carbon gases emitted by fossil
fuels.
