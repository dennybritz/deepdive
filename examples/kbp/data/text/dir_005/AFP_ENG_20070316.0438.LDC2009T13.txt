A bus ran over two young Bangladesh cricketers, including an
international allrounder, killing both of them in a road accident
in the southwestern city of Khulna Friday, police said.


The bus ran over Manjarul Islam Rana and his team-mate Sajedul
Islam Shetu after their motorcycle lost control, hit an electric
pole and fell into the main road near Khulna city, local police
chief Fazlul Haq said.


Rana, who played 25 one-day matches and six Tests for the
Bangladesh national team, died on the spot while his team-mate, a
regular on the country's first class cricket circuit, died on the
way to hospital, he said.


"They were going to a restaurant outside the city to have their
lunch after Rana led his team in an emphatic victory in
Bangladesh Cricket Board challenge trophy at Khulna stadium," he
added.


In the match Rana, aged 22, took two wickets and scored an
unbeaten 63 runs to lead his side to a seven-wicket victory.


Long-considered a potential all-rounder for Bangladesh national
squad, left-arm orthodox spinner and left-arm batsman Rana failed
to book a place in the World Cup following a slump in form in the
last year.


He made his debut in international circuit in 2004, but played
his last one-day match against Kenya in Dhaka last March.


He was, however, recalled for the recently concluded Bangladesh A
team's home series against England A and the was due to play in
the forthcoming away A-team series against Sri Lanka.
