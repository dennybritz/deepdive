Four soldiers were killed and 12 seriously wounded in clashes
with Tamil Tiger rebel in northern Sri Lanka Friday, military
sources said.


Security forces tried to advance towards positions of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the Vavuniya district,
but were beaten back by heavy mortar bomb fire by the guerrillas,
the sources said.


"Four soldiers were killed and another 12 were admitted to
hospital with serious injuries," a military official said, adding
that several others escaped with minor injuries.


There was no immediate word about rebel casualties.


"The army tried another move today to enter our area and we
repulsed the offensive," LTTE spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said.


It was the second attempt in as many days by troops to break into
Tiger territory, according to the guerrillas.


There was no immediate comment from the defence ministry, but
local officials in Vavuniya said troops were evacuating the
wounded by helicopter.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
since December 2005 despite a truce that has been in place, at
least on paper, since February 2002.
