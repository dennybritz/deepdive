An electricity firm belonging to bankrupt Russian energy group
Yukos is to be auctioned on April 17, Russian news agencies
quoted officials saying on Friday.


The lot includes a 100 percent stake in Energoservisnaya
Kompaniya and stakes in other energy service companies. The
starting price is 76.4 million euros (102 million dollars).


Another lot, including a 9.44-percent stake in Russia's number
two oil producer Rosneft, will be sold off on March 27 and a
third lot, including a 20 percent stake in Gazprom Neft, is to be
auctioned on April 4.


Prize assets from Yukos, the energy empire built up by jailed
oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, will be sold off by August, the
court-appointed official overseeing the liquidation, Eduard
Rebgun, said earlier this month.
