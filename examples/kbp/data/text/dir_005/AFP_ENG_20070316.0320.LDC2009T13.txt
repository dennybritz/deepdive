A helicopter carrying three western extreme skiers, among them a
Swiss pioneer of the sport, has gone missing in northern Indian-
administered Kashmir, officials said Friday.


"The helicopter has gone missing in the Sonamarg area," the head
of the Himalayan region's tourism department Farooq Shah told
AFP.


The area is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of the
Indian Kashmir summer capital of Srinagar.


"We have alerted the Indian Airforce and they are looking for the
chopper," Shah said.


The heliski trip was being led by Sylvain Saudan, a Swiss
national, officials said.


Saudan is recognised as a pioneer of extreme skiing, and has in
recent years been organising paid heliski trips to the Himalayan
region.


Details on the identities of the other two skiers or details on
the crew of the helicopter were not immediately available.


Heliskiing involves using a helicopter to reach isolated peaks
for off-piste descents away from the crowds of established, lift-
served resorts.
