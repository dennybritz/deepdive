The UN refugee agency said on Friday that it would ensure that
the return home of Sri Lankans displaced by fighting was
voluntary, following fresh assurances given by the government.


The move follows reports that Sri Lanka was forcing "scores" of
civilians back to their homes in the eastern regions of Vaharai
and Trincomalee this week despite fears that the areas were still
unsafe.


"Our office in Colombo... this morning was assured that UNHCR
would in future be fully engaged in the process to ensure that
any returns are voluntary and safe," said Ron Redmond, a
spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees.


UNHCR said the government had already given similar assurances
before.


A heavy police presence was reported in Batticaloa district on
Thursday, especially around camps where displaced people were
being ordered to board buses, Redmond said. About 152,000 people
have fled to the area.


The UNHCR is aiming to oversee the process and provide
information for would-be returnees on the situation in their home
areas.


The campaign group Human Rights Watch on Thursday said people
were being moved forcibly from at least six camps in eastern
Batticaloa district since Monday. It accused the military of
threatening to withdraw security for people who refused to
return.
