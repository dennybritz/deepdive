Ukraine is aiming for EU membership and a cooperation agreement
currently being negotiated with the bloc should not be seen as a
substitute, President Victor Yushchenko said Friday.


"An enhanced agreement is not an alternative to membership,"
Yushchenko said at a press conference following a meeting with
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen here.


EU negotiations on the so-called "Enhanced Agreement" with
Ukraine began this month and are expected to last at least one
year. The talks are aimed at drawing Kiev closer to the EU and
setting up a free-trade area.


Ukraine is a key EU energy partner, and the bloc hopes the new
agreement will help ensure energy security and environmental
standards.


The establishment of a free trade area will be negotiated once
Ukraine has finalised its accession process to the World Trade
Organistaion.


The current EU partnership and cooperation agreement with
Ukraine, signed in 1998, is due to expire next year.


Rasmussen said the EU "was open to all European democracies
meeting the necessary criteria" for membership.


"However, instead of beginning by focusing on the final goal, we
should concentrate on the instruments that will lead to it," he
said.
