The Netherlands won the toss and elected to field against South
Africa after a two-and-a-half hour rain delay in their World Cup
Group A match at Warner Park here on Friday.


The match was reduced to 40 overs-a-side after overnight and
early morning rain left the outfield wet and ruled out the
scheduled start at 9:30 am (13:30GMT).


As expected, South Africa left out paceman Makhaya Ntini who only
arrived in the Caribbean on Wednesday after attending the birth
of his daughter.
