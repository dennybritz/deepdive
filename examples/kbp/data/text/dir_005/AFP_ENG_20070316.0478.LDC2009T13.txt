Germany's federal crime agency said on Friday it saw no need to
increase security measures in response to ultimatums from
Islamist groups calling for German soldiers to withdraw from
Afghanistan.


Security measures were already "of a very high standard," said
Joerg Ziercke, president of the BKA agency.


"There is no need to panic," he said.


Ziercke admitted that the two warnings posted on the Internet by
different terror groups had shown a "new quality" because they
were aimed directly at Germany, but he warned against
"dramatising the risk of danger."


A group linked to Al-Qaeda called The Voice of the Caliphate
posted a video on an extremist website last weekend warning of
terrorist attacks on Germany and neighbouring Austria unless they
withdrew their troops from Afghanistan.


In a second message, another militant Islamist group threatened
to execute a German woman and her son being held hostage in Iraq
unless German forces pulled out of Afghanistan.


Germany has up to 3,000 troops based in northern Afghanistan,
where it commands the NATO-led International Security Assistance
Force.
