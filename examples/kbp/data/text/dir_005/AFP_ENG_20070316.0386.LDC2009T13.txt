Russian authorities on Friday threatened to withdraw a licence
for the massive Kovykta gas field from Russo-British energy group
TNK-BP and to auction off the reserve only to Russian investors.


"If the licence is withdrawn, it will be sold at auction as
strategic and foreign capital will have no right to participate,"
Russian Natural Resources Minister Yury Trutnev was quoted by
Russian news agencies as saying.


Russia is changing investment legislation to restrict foreign
business access to certain sectors of the economy, including
energy reserves, that are considered "strategic."


Rusia Petroleum, a company that is majority-owned by TNK-BP, came
under fire last month for not fulfilling its licence obligations
to provide the local Irkutsk region with gas from Kovykta.


Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom has signalled interest
in taking a majority stake in the project and some energy
analysts say that pressure from the authorities could be a way of
facilitating the sale to Gazprom.


A major stake in Sakhalin-2, a vast oil and gas project off
Russia's far eastern coast, was sold by British-Dutch energy
group Shell to Gazprom in December after the project came under
fire for environmental violations.


The Kovykta reserves are estimated at 1,900 billion cubic metres
of gas.
