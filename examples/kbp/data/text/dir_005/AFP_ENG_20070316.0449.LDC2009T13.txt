A court in Chad has given a six-month suspended prison sentence
to the editor of a satirical newspaper for libelling a priest, a
judicial source said on Friday.


In Wednesday's ruling, the court fined Adji Moussa 25,000 CFA
francs (38 euros) and ordered his Le Miroir newspaper to pay
500,000 CFA francs in damages to Father Michel Guimbaud.


The Catholic priest, who has run a centre for handicapped people
for the last 29 years, was the subject of a Le Miroir article
published in May 2006 entitled "A Mafia child of God."


It accused Guimbaud of "getting rich on the back of handicapped
people by embezzling aid and donations given to them" and of
using the centre in Moundou, about 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south-east of N'Djamena, to do business.


Le Miroir said the priest had "transported 17 million CFA francs
in coffins to put them into his foreign bank account."


Chadian authorities are quick to clamp down on offences committed
by the press. In 2005, four Chadian journalists were jailed for
several weeks for libel or inciting tribal and racial hatred.
