A former Croatian army general, sought by police in Croatia on
corruption charges and arrested this week in Vienna, has been
released on bail, an Austrian court said Friday.


"The one-million-euro (1.33 million dollars) bail was posted. The
court received confirmation. Since (former general Vladimir)
Zagorec fulfilled all judicial requirements with that, he was
released," said Christian Gneist, a spokesman for Vienna's
criminal court.


Zagorec was arrested late Tuesday under an international arrest
warrant issued earlier this month in Zagreb.


He is accused of having embezzled millions of dollars when he was
in charge of buying military weapons as Croatia's deputy defence
minister between 1993 and 2000.


Under bail rules, Zagorec, who has been living with his family in
Vienna, may not leave the country until he can be extradited, a
process that could take months. His passport has also been
confiscated.


"He committed himself not to change his Vienna address until the
extradition procedure has been completed," Gneist said.


Croatian President Stipe Mesic said the case was important for
his country as it strives to uncover similar embezzlement cases
of money intended for the country's defence.
