Austria, fielding what was essentially a second string team,
captured the Nations Cup at the World Cup alpine ski finals here
on Friday.


With stars Benjamin Raich, Marlies Schild and Nicole Hosp given a
day off ahead of the weekend's action Austria still had enough
strength in depth to see off Italy with France coming in third.


And to confirm their supremacy, the top ski nation did not even
need speed queen Renate Goetschl, slalom world champion Mario
Matt or multiple Olympic champion Hermann Maier.


The Wunderteam, like at the world championships in Sweden last
month, led from the front and were set on their way by the
victory of Andrea Fischbacher in the first heat of the super-G.


As for the other places on the podium, Italy and France got past
Switzerland and Canada in the final rounds of slalom races.
