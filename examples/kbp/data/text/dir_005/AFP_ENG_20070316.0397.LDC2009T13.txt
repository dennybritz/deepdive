The European Commission Friday expressed regret over a new Polish
drive to expose former secret police collaborators in the work
force but said it could do nothing about it.


"We strongly regret that this law has been implemented," said EU
Commission spokeswoman Cristina Arigho.


"We of course encourage participation for everybody in the work
force... but in terms of discrimination that doesn't come under
our competence," she told a press conference at the European
Commission.


Almost two decades after the fall of communism, Poland has
launched a drive to expose former secret police collaborators
with a law that critics denounce as reminiscent of the methods of
the old regime.


The new law, which came into force on Thursday, requires some
700,000 Poles to come clean about possible past ties with the
loathed Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa (SB) -- or risk losing their jobs.


They will be required to fill out declarations saying whether or
not they collaborated with the SB -- or face a sacking. Their
statements will be checked against the former secret police
archives.


Arigho said there was a European law against discrimination based
on age, race, sex, handicap or religious conviction but that "it
doesn't cover political convictions".


She did not say whether European Commissioner for Regional Policy
Danuta Huebner, who will visit Warsaw on Monday along with
Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen, would broach the issue
during talks with Polish Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga.
