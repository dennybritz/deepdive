Ireland prop Marcus Horan has been cleared to start for Ireland
in their final Six Nations match against Italy in Rome on
Saturday.


The Munster forward sat out last weekend's 19-18 win over
Scotland with a calf strain and had been given until Friday to
prove his fitness.


After coming through a training session, Horan reported no
reaction to the injury.


"Marcus is fine," said head coach Eddie O'Sullivan. "He had a
run-out this morning and so far everything is good. We are 95
percent sure he will be right for Italy. Obviously, something
could flare up overnight, but today I'm happy with his fitness."
