Public support for Japan's beleaguered Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
remains below 35 percent amid questions about his leadership, a
poll said Friday.


Jiji Press said approval of Abe's cabinet stood at 34.7 percent,
down 0.2 points from the previous poll in February, with the
disapproval rating unchanged at 39.2 percent.


The poll indicated that while Abe remains vulnerable, the slide
in support has bottomed out, at least for now, said Jiji Press,
which surveyed 2,000 people.


Abe took over from the popular Junichiro Koizumi in September and
quickly made breakthroughs in mending ties with China and South
Korea, helping him earn approval ratings of some 65 percent.


But support for Abe has steadily deteriorated amid questions
about his authority.


Abe, who at 52 is Japan's youngest post-war premier, has been
plagued by scandals among top aides and has readmitted to the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party old-guard members expelled in a
reform drive by Koizumi.


Japan holds national elections in July, which are considered
fraught with risk for Abe.


But the Jiji poll also showed the opposition has failed to
benefit from Abe's woes.


Support for the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan fell
another 1.9 points to a dismal 7.8 percent, the poll said.
