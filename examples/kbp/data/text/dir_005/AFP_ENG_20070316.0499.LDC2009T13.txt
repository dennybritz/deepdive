The Gulf state of Bahrain called on the West Friday to end its
crippling aid freeze against the Palestinian Authority now that a
broad-based coalition government is to be sworn in.


Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa urged the so-
called Quartet of major players in the Middle East peace process
to "back the (new) cabinet and lift the blockade and all other
forms of embargo so that the Palestinian people can return to
normality," official media said.


The Quartet -- the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and
the United States -- froze direct aid to the Palestinian
Authority in March last year when a government dominated by
Islamist movement Hamas took power.


It is to make way Saturday for a new government of national unity
including representatives of president Mahmud Abbas's secular
Fatah party and other factions.


Russia has already distanced itself from Quartet demands that any
new government must renounce violence and recognize Israel and
past peace deals for the flow of aid to resume.


The European Union and the United States have said they want to
study the new government's programme before taking a decision but
Israel has already said it will have no dealings with the new
cabinet.
