South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs hit six sixes in an over in his
team's World Cup match against the Netherlands here on Friday.


Gibbs became the first man in World Cup history to achieve the
feat which came in the 30th over with slow left-armer Daan van
Bunge the unfortunate bowler as ball after ball sailed over his
head.


The brutal big-hitting took Gibbs from 32 at the start of the
over to 68 by the end of it.


Van Bunge at least had the minor consolation of helping to
dismiss his tormentor when he held a catch in the deep in the
next over off Luuk van Troost.


Gibbs eventually went for 72 with four fours and seven sixes
having faced just 40 balls.
