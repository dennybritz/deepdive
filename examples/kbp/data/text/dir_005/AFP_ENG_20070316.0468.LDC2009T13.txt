Italy's Discovery Channel team leader Ivan Basso fell during the
third stage of the Tirreno-Adriatico between Marsciano and
Macerata on Friday, injuring his left wrist, Gazzetta dello Sport
reported on their internet site.


Italy's Riccardo Ricco, of the Saunier Duval team, won the 213km
stage ahead of Kazakh Alexandre Vinokourov and Andreas Kloden of
Germany.


Just after the finish, reigning Tour of Italy champion Basso fell
and was taken to hospital for an X-ray of his wrist. Though he
was later found not to have fractured the joint, he still might
not start Saturday's fourth stage.


World and Olympic champion Paolo Bettini of Italy, still
according to Gazzetta, also fell during the stage to hurt his
hand and was not able to compete for the stage win.
