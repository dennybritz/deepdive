The Polish treasury called Friday for the terms of the 2004 sale
of the PHS steel group to Arcelor Mittal to be reviewed, to see
if a more favourable deal for Poland could be renegotiated.


Deputy Treasury Minister Pawel Salamacha called for the review
during a parliamentary debate on the sale of Poland's biggest
steel concern.


In a recent report issued by the Polish Auditors' Court, the
value of PHS was "under-estimated by around two billion zlotys"
(513 million euros, 683 million dollars) at the time of the
group's aquisition by Arcelor Mittal.


The Auditors' Court recommended that the Treasury renegotiate the
terms of a call option that was part of the 2004 deal, which
would allow Arcelor Mittal to acquire an additional 25 percent
stake in PHS for one zloty per share, or a total of 67 million
zlotys.


But the court did not complain about Arcelor Mittal winning the
tender to buy PHS, saying that its offer was the best on the
table at the time.


The full details of the sale contract have not been made public.


PHS comprises the four main steelmills in Poland -- Huta
Sendzimira, Huta Katowice, Huta Florian and Huta Cedler -- which
between them account for 70 percent of Polish steel production.
