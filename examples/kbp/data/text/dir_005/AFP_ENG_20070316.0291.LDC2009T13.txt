US industrial production rebounded by a much stronger-than-
expected 1.0 percent in February after falling in the prior
month, the Federal Reserve said Friday.


Most economists had been expecting the US central bank's monthly
snapshot of the nation's vast industrial sector, measuring the
output of US factories, mines and utilities, to show a rise of
just 0.3 percent.


The spike in industrial output across the United States, the
strongest gain since November 2005, was largely attributed to a
hefty jump in gas and electricity output from the nation's
utilities amid cold winter temperatures.


The strong rebound comes despite a wider moderation of the
world's biggest economy.


The rate of capacity utilization -- seen as a key measure of
inflationary pressures for industry -- increased to a stronger-
than-expected 82.0 percent, 1.0 percentage points above its
1972-2006 average.


January's output was revised to a drop of 0.3 percent compared
with an initial estimate that output had fallen 0.5 percent.


Production at utilities, including gas and power plants, surged
6.7 percent in February while manufacturing production rose 0.4
percent and output from the nation's mines gained 0.1 percent.


The report showed a 3.4 percent year-over-year increase.


US economic growth slowed to a tepid 2.2 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2006, partly due to a sluggish manufacturing sector,
but also amid a housing market slump and weaker business
spending.
