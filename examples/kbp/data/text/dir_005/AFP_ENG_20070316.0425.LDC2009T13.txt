Scotland captain, Craig Wright, has had to fly home from the
World Cup following the death of an aunty, a team spokesman said
on Friday.


Wright, who took the wicket of Ricky Ponting during Scotland's
203-run defeat against Australia on Wednesday, left St Kitts on
Thursday and has been replaced in the short-term as captain by
Ryan Watson.


Team manager Euan McIntye told www.cricinfo.com that Wright would
miss Scotland's match against South Africa on Tuesday, but with
the funeral scheduled to be held on Monday 19, he was expected to
return in time for their key fixture against Holland next
Thursday.
