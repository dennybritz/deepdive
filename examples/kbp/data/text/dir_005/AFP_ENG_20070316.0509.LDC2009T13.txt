The US Coast Guard on Friday rescued an apparently drunk man who
jumped off the balcony of a cruise ship and spent eight hours
floating in the shark-infested waters off southern Florida.


"The crew of the Miami Beach Coast Guard Cutter Chandeleur
located the 35 year- old man waving his hands at the crew about
30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Fort Lauderdale," the rescuers
said in a statement.


Michael Mankamyer had spent eight hours in the water following a
20-meter (60-foot) plunge from the balcony of his cabin aboard
the "Carnival Glory" cruise ship, the Coast Guard said.


A witness who notified authorities said the man was intoxicated
when he jumped.


Mankamyer was hoisted aboard a rescue helicopter and taken to a
hospital, where he was apparently in good condition but suffering
from mild hypothermia.


The waters off Florida have the highest number of shark attacks
in the world, with 23 such recorded last year, as compared with
seven in Australia and four in South Africa, according to the
International Shark Attack File.
