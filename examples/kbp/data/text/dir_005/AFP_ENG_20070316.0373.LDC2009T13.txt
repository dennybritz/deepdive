German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned EU member states that
failure to endorse the bloc's stalled constitution would be a
"historic missed opportunity."


"The time for reflection is past. It's time for decisions. I
pledge that there will be a roadmap to move forward (with the
constitution) by the end of the German presidency," Merkel, whose
country currenty holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a
speech in Warsaw.


"It is not only in Europe's interest but also in the interest of
member states and citizens of Europe that this process is taken
to a positive end by the next European elections in 2009.


"Let me say this uncategorically: failure to do this would be a
historic missed opportunity," she said.


The EU needs the constitution, which was put on ice nearly two
years ago after French and Dutch voters rejected the draft text,
"to show that its institutions can continue to be democratic and
fully functional, with 27 member states or more," Merkel said.


Merkel said when she arrived in Warsaw earlier Friday that she
was in Poland not only as the head of Germany's government but
also as part of her role as current head of the EU.
