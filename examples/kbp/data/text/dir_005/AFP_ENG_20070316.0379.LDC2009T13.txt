Greece has allowed 16 stowaways on board a cargo ship to seek
asylum in the country, the UN refugee agency said Friday.


The 16 people, mainly Iraqis and including five children, had
boarded the Antigua-registered Rita at a Turkish port on Monday
by hiding in a container, the office of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees said.


They were found by the crew in a weakened state two days later,
when the Rita docked at the Greek port of Piraeus.


The UNHCR expressed its gratitude for the Greek decision to allow
the stowaways in, after aid workers visited them on board the
ship on Thursday.


Greece had originally invoked maritime law and stopped the group
from disembarking, insisting that they should be taken back to
Turkey.


The 16 are currently in a reception centre for asylum-seekers in
Athens.
