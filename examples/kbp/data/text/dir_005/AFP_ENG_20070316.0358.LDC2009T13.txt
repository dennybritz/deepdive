A British snowboarder and a French skier have died in separate
accidents near the resort of Zermatt in the Swiss Alps, local
police said Friday.


A 33-year-old British snowboarder was killed on Thursday when she
fell 15 metres (49 feet) into a crevasse on a glacier above
Zermatt, police in the southwestern canton of Valais said in a
statement.


The woman, who was not named, was part of a group of seven
snowboarders who had been dropped off by helicopter on the high
altitude Grenzgletscher.


A 50-year-old French skier also died Thursday in a similar
accident with another group heading across the border into Italy.
He also fell into a crevasse, Valais police said.
