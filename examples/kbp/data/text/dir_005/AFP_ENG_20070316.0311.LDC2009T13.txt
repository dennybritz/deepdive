A suicide bomber struck near a police patrol in eastern
Afghanistan Friday, wounding two soldiers and a civilian in the
latest of a series of such attacks, police said.


The attacker detonated explosives strapped to his body close to
an Afghan army patrol in a remote area about 10 kilometres (six
miles) northwest of the capital of Kunar province, the provincial
police chief said.


"Two soldiers and one civilian were wounded in the attack. The
suicide attacker was blown into pieces," General Abdul Jalal
Jalal said.


Eastern Afghanistan has seen fewer of the suicide attacks against
Afghan and foreign forces that plague southern and southeastern
Afghanistan.


The Taliban, blamed for most of nearly 140 suicide attacks in
2006, have vowed a new wave of attacks this year in their battle
to bring down President Hamid Karzai's government which enjoys
vast Western support.


The militants were ousted from power in late 2001.
