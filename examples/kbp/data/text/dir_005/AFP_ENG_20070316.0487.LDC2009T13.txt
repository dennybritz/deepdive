Police in the eastern state of Maryland arrested a seven-year-old
boy, hauled him to jail where his mug shot and fingerprints were
taken on a charge of riding a motorbike on a sidewalk.


A spokeswoman for the Baltimore police department told AFP that
the incident, which has sparked controversy, took place on
Tuesday after a police officer noticed the boy riding the dirt
bike.


"The officer confiscated the bike and it was towed while the
seven-year-old boy was taken into custody and transported to
juvenile booking," said the spokeswoman, who did not want her
name used.


She said the boy's mother did not accompany her son to jail and
he was released shortly after being booked.


"He was arrested at 4:15 p.m. and he was released at about 6:20
p.m.," she said.
