Palestinian gunmen fired on the convoy of the director of the
United Nations refugee agency as he returned to Gaza City on
Friday, but there were no casualties, security sources and
witnesses said.


"Eleven bullets hit his armoured car. We don't know who did it
yet. We are investigating," a security source said.


John Ging, the Gaza director of the UN Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA), was travelling from the Erez border crossing to Gaza
City when the attack happened.


Violence has escalated in the Gaza Strip since Hamas came to
power one year ago and plunged the Palestinian territories into a
power struggle pitting the Fatah- dominated security services
against Hamas militants.


Although around 20 foreign journalists and aid workers have been
kidnapped and released unharmed in the past year, such a direct
and bold attack against foreigners in the Gaza Strip is rare.


The latest victim, BBC reporter Alan Johnston, has not been seen
since he left the BBC bureau in Gaza City on Monday afternoon.
Palestinian security sources said he was kidnapped.


UNRWA, the largest UN agency with more than 25,000 employees, was
established in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to
provide relief for upwards of 700,000 Palestinian refugees
uprooted by the war.


Today the agency provides education, health, relief and social
services to more than 4.3 million registered Palestinian refugees
in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.


In the Gaza Strip alone, UNRWA cares for nearly one million
refugees.
