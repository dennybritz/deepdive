Former Ireland forward Trevor Brennan was Friday banned for life
from playing rugby union for striking a supporter during
Toulouse's 28-13 European Cup victory over Ulster in January.


The ban was imposed by an independent disciplinary committee
after a hearing in London which Brennan did not attend. The
Toulouse player has the right to appeal.
