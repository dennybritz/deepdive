An Azerbaijani soldier has been killed by an Armenian sniper near
the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, violating a ceasefire
between the two ex-Soviet states, Azerbaijani authorities said
Friday.


Private Dilgam Sirinov was killed Thursday by fire from an
Armenian sniper on the territory of the Agdam region, the defence
ministry said in a statement.


Armenian forces seized Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan during a
war in the early 1990s that claimed an estimated 35,000 lives and
forced about a million people on both sides to flee their homes.


A ceasefire was signed in 1994, but the two countries have cut
direct economic and transport links and failed to negotiate a
settlement on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.


Armenian and Azerbaijani forces are spread across the ceasefire
line, often as little as a few dozen metres apart, and shootings
are common.
