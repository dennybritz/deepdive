Nine people including four French, three American and two
Egyptian tourists were injured Friday when their hot air balloon
crashed over the historic town of Luxor in southern Egypt, a
security source said.


The nine were floating above the west bank of Luxor, one of
Egypt's most renowned archaeological sites and home to the famous
Valley of the Kings, when strong winds brought their balloon
crashing to the ground.


They suffered minor injuries and were taken to Luxor hospital,
the source told AFP.


Six of the tourists were released immediately and three others
including one French and one American tourist were being treated
for minor injuries but were expected to be released later Friday,
the source said.
