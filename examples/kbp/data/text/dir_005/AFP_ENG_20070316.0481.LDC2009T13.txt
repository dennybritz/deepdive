A United Nations bird flu conference will take place this month
in Italy charged with implementing a global strategy for the
vaccination of threatened species, organisers said Friday.


The Verona summit will allow experts to exchange information on
the fight against the virus and look at the financial and
logistical implications of a worldwide vaccination effort, a
statement from the organisers said.


It will take place in the north eastern town on March 20 and 22
and be attended by representatives of the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
Zoological Institute of Venice.


The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu was detected at nine farms
across Egypt on Wednesday, despite a vaccination campaign
implemented in January, with poor refrigeration of the vaccines
blamed for the outbreak.


World experts fear the strain could mutate into a form easily
spread among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the
potential to kill millions.


Up to 169 people have been killed worldwide, according to WHO,
with the latest victim, a 32-year-old Indonesian man, dying on
Friday.
