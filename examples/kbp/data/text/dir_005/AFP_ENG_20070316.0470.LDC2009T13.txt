Bangladesh's World Cup squad was in mourning on Friday after the
death of international colleague Manjarul Islam Rana and fellow
cricketer Sajedul Islam Shetu in a road accident.


Manjarul and Sajedul died when the motorcycle on which they were
travelling collided with a bus in the southwestern Bangladesh
city of Khulna.


"I am deeply shocked. He was our team-mate and we played together
for a long time," said Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar of
Manjarul who played six Tests and 25 one-day internationals but
missed out on the World Cup squad.


"All the boys are really shocked and upset. Some of them also
cried because he was very close to us. I think he was supposed to
tour Sri Lanka with the Bangladeshi 'A' team. It is a very sad
news."


Left-arm spinner Manjarul, who was just 22, made his ODI debut in
November 2003 at the age of 19 and took the wicket of England
skipper Michael Vaughan with his third ball.


He made his Test debut at Harare against Zimbabwe in 2003-04.


His best performances in one-dayers were a brace of four-wicket
hauls to help level the series against Zimbabwe in 2005.


Bangladeshi batsman Javed Omar said: "It's a very sad news for
Bangladesh cricket and for me because he was very close to me.
May God give strength to his family. It's very unfortunate."


Opening batsman Shahriar Nafees added: "It's very shocking. We
just could not believe it. He was a very nice guy and very close
to our hearts. It's very sad."


Bangladesh play their first World Cup match against India here on
Saturday in Group B which also includes Sri Lanka and Bermuda.
