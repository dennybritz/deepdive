Palestinian gunmen fired on the convoy of the director of the
United Nations refugee agency as he returned to Gaza City on
Friday, but there were no casualties, security sources and
witnesses said.


"Eleven bullets hit his armoured car. We don't know who did it
yet. We are investigating," a security source said.


John Ging, the Gaza director of the UN Relief and Works Agency,
was travelling from the Erez border crossing to Gaza City when
the attack occurred.
