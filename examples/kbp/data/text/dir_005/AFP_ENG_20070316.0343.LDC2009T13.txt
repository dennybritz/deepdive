A Florida teenager's intractable hiccups are back, just when she
thought it was safe to return to school after the almost
uninterrupted diaphragm spasm that had plagued her for five weeks
subsided.


On her second day back at school since the unusual condition
started on January 15, Jennifer Mee had to leave class again, as
her nose started to bleed and the almost non-stop hiccups set in
again, the St Petersburg Times newspaper reported on Friday.


"I'm at my wit's end," said Rachel Robidoux, the  girl's mother,
adding that her daughter is upset, discouraged and in pain.


Mee had started hiccuping on January 23, close to 50 times a
minute. All of a sudden, on February 28, she took a deep breath
and appeared to have been cured, until the hiccups set in again
on Thursday.


No one knows what had made the hiccups stop for a while.


Mee had seen an infectious disease specialist, a neurologist, a
chiropractor, a hypnotist and an acupuncturist, took prescription
medication, tried a patented device designed to stop hiccups, and
appeared on the NBC network's Today show.
