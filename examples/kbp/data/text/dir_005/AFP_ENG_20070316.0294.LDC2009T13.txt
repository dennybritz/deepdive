Wall Street opened lower Friday as the market mulled data on US
inflation and industrial production and started to position for
next week's Federal Reserve meeting.


In early market action, the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted
down 16.42 points (0.14 percent) to 12,143.26 and the Nasdaq
composite fell 5.22 points (0.22 percent) to 2,373.48.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index edged down a
fractional 0.33 point (0.02 percent) to 1,391.95.


The Federal Reserve reported US industrial production rebounded
by a much stronger-than-expected 1.0 percent in February.


A separate report showed US consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in
February.    But the "core" inflation index, which excludes
volatile food and energy costs, was up a more modest 0.2 percent.


Dick Green at Briefing.com said he sees the market stabilizing.


"The stock market's main concern is potential economic weakness,"
he said. "There is as of yet no real evidence that economic
growth is taking a dive."
