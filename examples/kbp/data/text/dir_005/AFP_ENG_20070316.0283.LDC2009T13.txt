About 2.5 million tickets have been ordered for Euro 2008, more
than seven times the number initially available for the European
championship finals in Austria and Switzerland, the organisers
said Friday.


With another two weeks to go before orders are closed, request
for tickets have flooded in from 233,000 fans in 128 countries,
as far afield as Australia, China, India, Africa and South
America, the Euro 2008 SA organising company said.


"In the league table of applications from fans, Switzerland has
opened up a clear lead, followed by Austria and Germany," said
Christian Mutschler, the tournament director for Switzerland.


Just 330,000 tickets are available in the direct Internet sales
for the event before the closing date of March 31. Tickets for
oversubscribed matches will be allocated next month by lottery.


Another 399,000 tickets will be sold early next year through the
national associations of the 16 teams that eventually qualify for
the finals.
