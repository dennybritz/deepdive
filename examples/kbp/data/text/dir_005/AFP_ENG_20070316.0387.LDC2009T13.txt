A South African prophet was seriously injured after being stoned
by a group of angry villagers who paid her for protection from a
tornado that never arrived, police said Friday.


Elisabeth Njuza, 42, told inhabitants of a Rustenburg village,
about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north west of Johannesburg, that
they had a week to prepare themselves for a violent tornado.


She demanded everyone pay her two rand (30 US cents) for her
protection, telling them "the ancestors recommended her to do
so," said Elsabe Augoustides, police spokeswoman for the North-
West province.


The money collected would be thrown into rivers and lakes in the
vicinity of the village to appease the spirit of the tornado,
represented by a water snake named Moeka.


But by Thursday evening the tornado had not arrived and angry
residents -- who had not been reimbursed -- attacked the
prophetess.


"She was assaulted by about 800 people who stoned her and burnt
down her house," said Augoustides.


"She has been badly injured and was transferred to the hospital.
Some of her children and others relatives have been injured too."


Two people were arrested and police were investigating a case of
public violence.
