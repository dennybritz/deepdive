Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Friday that he was
"unpleasantly surprised" with the Japanese cabinet's new
statement that there was no evidence Japan forced women into
prostitution during World War II.


Historians say up to 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea but
also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan, were
forced to serve as sex slaves in Japanese army brothels.


Among the euphemistically named "comfort women" were also
hundreds of Dutch nationals who were taken from the Dutch colony
of Indonesia, occupied by Japan during the war.


In his weekly press briefing Balkenende said his foreign minster
had summoned the Japanese ambassador to explain Tokyo's stance.


In 1998 then Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto sent a
letter of apology to the Dutch government saying he recognized
"that the issue of comfort women, with an involvement of the
Japanese military authorities at that time, was a grave affront
to the honor and dignity of large numbers of women".
