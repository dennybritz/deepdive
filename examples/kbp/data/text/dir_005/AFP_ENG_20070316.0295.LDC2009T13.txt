The Taliban movement which had threatened to kill an Italian
journalist Friday has extended its deadline by three days, a
spokesman told AFP.


"The ultimatum which ended today has been extended for another
three days after the Italian government made a request through
media," Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP by telephone.


"After their request, we extended three days which are Saturday,
Sunday and Monday and the ultimatum finishes Monday evening."


In a statement released in Rome Friday, the Italian foreign
ministry said the situation was complex and it needed more time
to negotiate a solution.


Daniele Mastrogiacomo, 52, was kidnapped with two Afghan
colleagues -- a driver and a guide -- in southern Afghanistan on
March 4.


The Pajhwok Afghan News cited a Taliban spokesman saying Friday
one of the Afghans had been killed after being accused of being a
spy.
