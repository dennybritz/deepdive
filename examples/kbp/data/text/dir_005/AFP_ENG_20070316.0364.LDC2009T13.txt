The lawyers for former Liberian president Charles Taylor on
Friday said they had suspended legal visits to the war crimes
suspect in protest against a camera being installed in his cell.


Karim Khan, one of Taylor's British lawyers, told a press
conference in Freetown that the move was "unheard of in most
civilised systems," adding: "Our sanctity of legal visit has been
violated."


Taylor is currently being held in The Hague, where his trial for
11 counts of crimes against humanity, war crimes and human rights
violations will be heard by the Special Court for Sierra Leone
(SCSL) from June 4.


The hearing was moved to the International Criminal Court (ICC)
from the SCSL's base in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone,
for security reasons.


Khan said that following a complaint, the SCSL president had
asked the ICC to remove the camera from Taylor's cell, but the
request was denied.


"It is a cause of lament that it seems that the special court is
not sovereign in relation to its own accused," the lawyer said.


He added: "It seemed as if the Special Court for Sierra Leone is
going out with a begging bowl to foreign international legal
institutions, not as an equal but separate judicial institution."


SCSL officials in Freetown refused to comment on Khan's remarks.


Taylor, 58, is seen as a key player in the series of civil wars
in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003,
which left about 400,000 people dead. He has maintained he is
innocent of the charges.
