The United States on Friday congratulated Senegal President
Abdoulaye Wade on winning reelection last month and said the
political contest was evidence of the country's "healthy
democratic system."


"The United States congratulates President Abdoulaye Wade on his
re-election victory in Senegal's elections last month," White
House spokesman Tony Snow said in a statement.


"We further commend the people of the Republic of Senegal for
their unprecedented high voter turnout. Their involvement is a
testament to Senegal's commitment to a healthy democratic
system," Snow said.


"The United States stands with the Senegalese people on this
occasion and will continue to support their efforts to build a
safe and prosperous democracy," he said.


Wade, 80, who took office after three nearly decades in
opposition, saw his victory in the February 25 vote secured on
Sunday when the country's highest electoral court dismissed an
opposition challenge to his reelection.


The 12-million strong nation is considered an oasis of democracy
because it is the only country in volatile west Africa to have
never experienced a coup.
