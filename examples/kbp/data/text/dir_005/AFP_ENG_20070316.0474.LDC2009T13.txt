Saudi Arabia coach Marco Paqueta of Brazil was sacked by the
country's football federation on Friday and replaced by
compatriot Helio Dos Angos.


Paqueta, who had held the job since December 2005, led Saudi
Arabia at the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany when they exited
after the first round group stage.


Dos Angos, who has coached several Brazilian clubs, will be
entrusted with preparing the Saudi team for the Asian Nations Cup
in July, organised jointly by Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and
Saudi Arabia.
