Swiss food and nutrition giant Nestle said Friday it had opened a
67-million- dollar (50 million euro) milk processing plant in
Pakistan.


The plant in Kabirwala, Punjab province, can process two million
litres of milk per day, with capacity set to rise to over three
million litres in coming years, Nestle said in a statement.


The inauguration ceremony was attended by Pakistan's president
Pervez Musharraf and Nestle CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe.


Nestle said it boasts Pakistan's largest milk collection network,
collecting milk from 140,000 Punjabi farmers.


The company has in the past come in for fierce criticism and
consumer boycotts over its policy of marketing powdered milk and
infant formula in developing countries.
