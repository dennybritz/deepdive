A bomb exploded Friday in a destitute neighborhood of the
Colombian Pacific port city of Buenaventura, killing four people
and seriously wounding five others, a top local official said.


The dead were apparently passersby while police officers were
among the wounded who were taken to a local hospital, Valle del
Cauca department Governor Angelino Garzon told AFP.


Buenaventura has been hit in recent months by violence linked to
a turf war between leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries
and drug traffickers fighting for control of Colombia's main
Pacific port, a major shipping point for cocaine to other
countries.
