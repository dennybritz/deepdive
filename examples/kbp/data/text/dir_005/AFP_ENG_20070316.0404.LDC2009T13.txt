An Ugandan court granted thousands of late dictator Idi Amin's
former soldiers compensation totalling 2.6 billion dollars for
unpaid wages as they were never formally dismissed from the army,
officials said Friday.


At least 20,000 soldiers, many of whom were arrested after Amin
was toppled in 1979, filed the suit four years ago to demand
compensation for unpaid salaries for more than two decades,
arguing that they were still technically in the army.


Judges on Thursday ruled that the failure to dismiss the former
strongman's soldiers meant they had been in the military since
1979, even if they were not on the government payroll.


Lawyers were hopeful that the impoverished country would actually
pay up the cash.


"We won the court battle and we think that government will be
able to pay this money over a period of time," defence lawyer
John Matovu told AFP in Kampala.


"The government has been paying for many things that are not a
priority," he added.


Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's brutal reign, between 1971 and
1979, left around 300,000 people dead in one of Africa's
bloodiest episodes.


Amin, who died in 2003 in Saudi Arabia, never returned to his
country after he was ousted by Tanzanian troops and Ugandan
exiles on April 11, 1979.
