SEAT, the ailing Spanish subsidiary of German auto giant
Volkswagen, is planning further belt-tightening measures which
could include cutting 10 percent of its workforce -- or 1,400
jobs in all -- by 2009, a VW spokesman said on Friday.


"It's a proposal that will be negotiated," the spokesman said.


Management and unions would meet in the next few days with SEAT
expecting a deal to be reached in the coming weeks.


The cuts would be implemented via voluntary redundancies and
early retirement, the spokesman continued, adding that a final
figure had not yet been agreed, with negotiations still underway
with unions.


Already earlier this month, SEAT chief Erich Schmitt said: "With
the current level of costs in Spain, it's very difficult to
compete in eastern Europe. For this reason w're working to
improve profitability and cut costs."


Analysts and industry experts have frequently speculated about
the future of SEAT which skidded into a loss of 62.5 million
euros (83 million dollars) in 2005 and also ran up a loss of 50
million euros last year, despite 660 job cuts.


In order to steer the unit back to profit, VW announced a 400
-million-euro investment programme earlier this month, including
the launch of two new models.


The German parent is also planning to boost productivity at
SEAT's Barcelona factory.


The Spanish car maker employs a total workforce of 14,000 in
Spain.
