A suburb of the Dutch capital Amsterdam was rocked by an
explosion that tore off the front of a building, the Dutch ANP
news agency reported Friday.


The explosion caused the facade of a house on the Voorburgstraat
in the western suburb of Slotervaart to collapse. The Amsterdam
fire brigade told ANP it is unclear what caused the blast and if
there are any victims.
