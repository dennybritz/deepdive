Who's saying what at the World Cup:


"If we had been in that situation a few times before we would
have known how to pull through, but we panicked at the end."


- Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya after his team tied their match
with Ireland despite just needing 18 runs to win off 38 balls
with five wickets remaining at one stage.


"We did our best to throw it away. But we fought back in the last
eight to 10 overs to give ourselves a chance. We have a great
bunch of fighters in our team and we never know when the game is
over."


- Ireland skipper Trent Johnston


"It was a wonderful experience. They are disappointed with the
result, but they know it is a special day for Bermuda."


- Bermuda captain Irving Romaine puts a gloss on his team's
243-run defeat to Sri Lanka, the second heaviest in World Cup
history.


"For us, it is always good to have these countries playing in big
tournaments. That was how we learnt. Hopefully, they will do the
same. We have to take into consideration that they are making
their debut."


- Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene backing the minnows' place
in the World Cup.


"I know as a batsman I wouldn't want to face our attack. It's
pretty devastating at times."


- Australia's Brad Hodge glad to have the likes of Shaun Tait and
Glenn McGrath on his side.
