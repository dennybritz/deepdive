The United States said Friday it would expedite Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's request for a visa to address the UN
Security Council when it votes on a new sanctions resolution
against his country next week.


State Department spokesman Sean McCormack urged Ahmadinejad to
use the appearance to do an about face and announce the
suspension of his country's uranium enrichment program as
demanded under previous UN resolutions.


McCormack said Iran had applied via the US embassy in Switzerland
for visas for Ahmadenijad and his delegation to attend the UN
Security Council session that will vote on a resolution
toughening UN sanctions against Tehran.


That meeting is expected sometime next week.


"We are going to do everything that we can in accordance with our
(UN) host country responsibilities to expedite the issuing of any
such visas," he said.
