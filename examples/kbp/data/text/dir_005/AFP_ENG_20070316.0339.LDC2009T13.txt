A team from the Democratic Republic of Congo has travelled to the
southwest of the country bordering Angola as part of efforts to
resolve a border dispute, officials said Friday.


The visit follows a meeting between Angolan and DR Congo
government representatives earlier in the week which agreed the
need to establish a common frontier to prevent further
territorial disputes.


Kinshasa has condemned what it said was an Angolan incursion into
the diamond- rich southwestern region of Kahemba in February,
accusing Angolan security forces of having occupied 11 villages.


Luanda has strongly rejected the claims.


"The 1891 convention between (former colonial powers) Belgium and
Portugal defines the border limits.


"We have to retrace them, analyze their current position compared
to the old surveys," Godefroid Mayobo, a minister in the office
of DRC's Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga told AFP.


He said there could have been movements by people on the DRC side
in recent years. "We don't rule out moving the boundary. But it
is too early to reach a conclusion."


At Tuesday's meeting in Kinshasa, the two countries established a
bilateral team charged with identifying the 112 border markers
between Angola and the DRC to enable "joint patrols along the
common frontier."


Led by the DRC Interior Minister Denis Kalume Numbi, the DRC
delegation comprises parliamentarians and locally-elected
officials as well as geographic and migration experts and police.
