Egypt on Sunday slammed Amnesty International condemnation of
President Hosni Mubarak's proposed constitutional changes, saying
that non-Egyptians had no right to comment on the country's
internal matters.


Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit said Amnesty's statement was
"an attempt to impose foreign oversight on the decision of the
Egyptian people."


The human rights body called on Egypt's parliament on Saturday to
reject the proposed changes which it described as the most
serious undermining of the people's rights in 26 years.


"It is not the right of non-Egyptians to comment or simply pass
an opinion on a purely internal question, that is, on the
constitution (of Egypt) and its national laws," said the minister
in a statement received by AFP.


Egypt's parliament on Sunday began debating the changes with
around 100 MPs, mainly Islamists, boycotting the session in
protest at the attempt to change the constitution.


Nearly 100 Egyptian personalities have already denounced the
proposals, accusing Mubarak of laying the groundwork for his son
Gamal to succeed to the presidency.


In its criticism, Amnesty said the changes would give sweeping
powers of arrest to the police, allow monitoring of private
communications and enable Egypt's president to bypass ordinary
courts for people suspected of terrorism.


If parliament adopts the changes, the amendments will be put to a
referendum on April 4.
