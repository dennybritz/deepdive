Japan on Monday welcomed the US agreement to unfreeze North
Korean funds at a Macau bank, hoping it would help bring progress
in six-nation talks on North Korea's nuclear programme.


Japan has taken the hardest line within the six-nation talks and
maintains its own sweeping sanctions on North Korea.


"We expect the deal will lead the six-way talks in a good
direction, even though the talks on the frozen funds in the Banco
Delta Asia and the six-party talks are separate matters," chief
government spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki said.


"This is meaningful in that the deal provides a favourable
environment for the six-party talks," he told a news conference.


The United States said Monday it had agreed on the release of
some 25 million dollars in North Korean money which has been
frozen at the Macau bank since 2005 due to US allegations of
money laundering and counterfeiting.


The announcement came hours before the latest six-nation talks in
Beijing. North Korea has insisted it will not implement a
February 13 deal on disabling its main nuclear reactor until the
financial sanctions were lifted.


Unlike the United States, its closest ally, Japan has refused to
moderate its hard line against North Korea, which tested an atom
bomb in October.


Japan demands North Korea take action over its past abductions of
Japanese civilians, an issue on which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
has built his career campaigning.
