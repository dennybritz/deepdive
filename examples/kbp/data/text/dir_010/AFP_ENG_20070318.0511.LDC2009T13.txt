China share prices rose 0.74 percent in early trade Monday,
shrugging off the central bank's interest rate hike at the
weekend aimed at cooling the relentless pace of economic growth,
dealers said.


They said share prices initially slipped as property prices came
into focus over concerns about increased borrowing costs, but
fresh fund inflows and the strengthening yuan soon pushed the key
index into positive territory.


The central bank's move on Saturday to raise key interest rates
will not have a big impact on market liquidity due to the
stronger currency and expected strong exports, dealers added.


The central bank lifted the one-year bank deposit rates to 2.79
percent and the one-year lending rate to 6.39 percent in a move
it described as aiming to stabilise prices.


The release of a slew of data last week including key indicators
such as the inflation rate and industrial output figures all
pointed to the likely acceleration of economic growth, already at
10.7 percent in 2006.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, rose 21.66 points
to 2,952.14.


The Shanghai A-share index was up 22.85 points or 0.74 points at
3,101.93 while the Shenzhen A-share index rose 4.27 points or
0.53 points at 813.46.
