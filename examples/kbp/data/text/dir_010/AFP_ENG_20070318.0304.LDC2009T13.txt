Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was taken to hospital after he was
found unconscious in his hotel room, an official said on Sunday.


"We have taken Bob Woolmer to the hospital and he is in the
emergency ward. We don't know anything more at the moment,"
Pakistan team media manager Pervez Mir told AFP.


Pakistan were knocked out of the World Cup on Saturday after a
shock three- wicket defeat to Ireland.


Sky Sports reported that Woolmer was found at 1045 local time
(1545GMT) on the floor of his hotel room unconscious and with
signs of vomiting.


An ambulance took the 58-year-old Woolmer to the Kingston
University Hospital.


The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is expected to release a
statement later Sunday.
