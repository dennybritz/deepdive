Polling stations closed across Finland on Sunday after
legislative elections that were expected to return Prime Minister
Matti Vanhanen to power thanks to his strong economic record.


If Vanhanen emerges victorious he could choose to continue his
centre-left coalition with the Social Democrats, or shift to a
centre-right alliance with the Conservative National Coalition
Party, depending on which party garners the most support.


In final opinion polls published in the days before Sunday's
vote, Vanhanen's Centre Party was credited with between 23.3 and
24.7 percent of voter intentions after an election campaign that
focused on health care, job creation and care for the elderly as
Finland has one of Europe's most rapidly ageing populations.


The Social Democrats and the opposition Conservatives were neck-
and-neck in the final opinion polls, with the former garnering
between 21.3 and 22.6 percent support and the latter between 20.4
and 22.1 percent.


However the Social Democrats appeared to be losing ground to the
Conservatives toward the end of the campaign and were struggling
to retain their place in government.
