Tom Lehman, who captained last year's losing US Ryder Cup effort,
will miss the Masters for only the second time in 15 years
despite sharing fifth at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.


The 48-year-old American who won the 1996 British Open needed to
finish first or second at Bay Hill to jump from 79th in the world
rankings into the top 50, then stay there after next week's World
Golf Championships event.


Instead he was five strokes off the pace of winner Vijay Singh
and missed out on next week's event at Doral, giving him no
chance to play at Augusta National Golf Club in the year's first
major event in three weeks.


"The only problem I have with next week being a short field event
is it's the final week before you qualify for the Masters,"
Lehman said.


"I've been trying to work my way into the Masters and I need
another week and I don't get it now, so that's the tough thing.
It's my fault I didn't play well enough to get there, but it
would have been nice to have one more week.


"Now I get to go home and watch it on TV."


Lehman was third in his 1993 Masters debut and finished second
the following year to Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal.
