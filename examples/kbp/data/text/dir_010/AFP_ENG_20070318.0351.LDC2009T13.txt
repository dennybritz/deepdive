Kuwait on Sunday welcomed the formation of the Palestinian unity
government as a "positive and constructive step" but added that
it hoped the cabinet would respond to international expectations.


"While sending its sincere congratulations to the brotherly
Palestinian people and its leadership for this positive and
constructive step, Kuwait hope that it will achieve the necessary
interaction between this government and the international
community to realise the aspirations of the brotherly
Palestinians," a foreign ministry spokesman said.


The spokesman, quoted by the official KUNA news agency, praised
the Palestinians for the "wisdom and spirit of responsibility"
which had led to the formation of the government.


The new government, sworn in on Saturday, includes both the
Islamist Hamas of prime minister Ismail Haniya, and the secular
Fatah of president Mahmud Abbas.


Its formation came after weeks of wrangling and the deaths of
scores of people killed in clashes between militants of the two
sides.


Israel has said it will not deal with the government and called
on the international community to maintain its aid blockade. This
was imposed a year ago after Hamas -- seen by the West as a
terrorist organisation -- won an overwhelming victory over Fatah
in democratic elections in 2006 and formed a government.
