George Foreman was among those who paid tribute to Muhammad Ali
here at Sunday's "Rumble Replay", a fundraiser featuring a video
replay of their famed 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle".


The 65-year-old boxing legend did not speak at the celebration at
the center which bears his name, although he signed autographs
and greeted supporters who came from as far away as Australia and
Germany to meet the sporting icon.


"I've followed him all my life, but I never saw him in person
until today. It's a great privilege," Aussie visitor Ken Fogarty
said.


Ali knocked out Foreman in the eighth round of their epic
confrontation at Zaire, the loser calling the gathering to say
that losing to Ali put him on the path to become a minister and
later regain the heavyweight crown at age 45.


"Muhammad actually whipped the devil out of me," Foreman said,
calling Ali a "great man" who "made me a better man."


The rope-a-dope strategy Ali used to allow Foreman to tire
himself out was on display while Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee
offered comments between rounds of the replay presentation,
recalling his fear about loose ropes.


"I was scared to death that Muhammad would fall through," Dundee
said.
