Francois Bayrou of the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF)
will win France's presidential election if he can make it through
to the decisive second round of the vote, according to a new poll
Sunday.


In the two-candidate run-off set for May 6, Bayrou would win by
54 percent to 46 percent against Nicolas Sarkozy of the ruling
centre-right party, and by 60 percent to 40 percent against the
Socialist candidate Segolene Royal, according to the TNS-Sofres
survey for RTL radio and Le Figaro newspaper.


However Bayrou remains in third place in polls on the multi-
candidate first round set for April 22, with 22 percent of the
vote. He is two points behind Royal with 24 percent while Sarkozy
has 31 percent, according to the poll.
