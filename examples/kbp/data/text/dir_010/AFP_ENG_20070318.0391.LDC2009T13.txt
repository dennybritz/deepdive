Vandals desecrated a Jewish synagogue in a southern Russia city
at the weekend with swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans, a
judicial source said Sunday.


An enquiry has been launched into the incident at Voronezh, the
Itar-Tass new agency reported, citing local prosecutor Mikhail
Usov.


The city's Jewish community condemned the act, saying it would
only stir up racial tension.


Usov added that two youths aged 19 and 20 had been arrested in
connection with an attack on a Jewish cemetery on March 6, which
caused the destruction of around 20 gravestones.


Five teenagers were sentenced to between five and 10 years in
jail last month for the 2005 killing of a Jewish adolescent in a
city in the Russian Urals.


The Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia last November
called for greater protection after what it said was a rise in
anti-Semitic acts.


Racist attacks, often attributed to radical nationalists, have
risen in Russia over recent years, with at least 520 people
attacked and 54 killed in 2006 alone, the Moscow research
institute Sova said.
