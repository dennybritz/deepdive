China has approved a plan to build large passenger aircraft to
compete with Boeing and Airbus, the government and state-run
media said Monday.


The decision was made at a meeting of the Cabinet presided over
by Premier Wen Jiabao after listening to details of a feasibility
study on the project, the State Council said in a statement
posted on the government's website.


The plan is to "design and build airplanes that can carry more
than 150 passengers and compete with Airbus and Boeing," the
state-run China Daily said in a report.


The newspaper characterised the decision as "a major strategic
decision" and said the project will begin "as soon as possible."


In the statement, the Cabinet also said it has approved a plan to
set up a company to manufacture large aircraft.


China has the technical and material capabilities to develop
large aircraft, having been developing its aviation industry for
50 years, the statement said.


The Cabinet meeting was held on February 26. It did not explain
why it took three weeks to announce the decision to the public.
