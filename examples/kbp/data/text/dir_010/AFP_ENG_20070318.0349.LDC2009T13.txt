Kosovan authorities Sunday called on the public for help to track
down three men who robbed and assaulted two Catholic priests,
officials said.


The incident occurred at a church in the eastern village of
Bince, when three unidentified men took mobile phones and cash
from the priests, police said, adding that an enquiry had been
launched.


The priests suffered light injuries.


Describing it as an attack on the religious feeling of all
Kosovans, the government said it was "calling on the public to
help police discover and arrest those responsible for this act."


Although there are an estimated 50,000 Catholics in the province,
the majority of its two million inhabitants -- around 95 percent
-- are Muslim.        Kosovo has been managed by a UN mission
since mid-1999, when three months of bombing by NATO ended a
crackdown by Serbian forces loyal to then president Slobodan
Milosevic on the province's ethnic Albanians.
