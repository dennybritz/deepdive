France's Amelie Mauresmo announced on her web site Sunday that
she has pulled out of the ATP/WTA Miami tournament.


She gave no explanation for pulling out of the hardcourt
tournament that features the top men's and women's players in the
world.


Mauresmo has not played since a February 24 loss to Belgian
Justin Henin. She is currently ranked third in the world but that
will change to fourth when the new rankings come out Monday.
