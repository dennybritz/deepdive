German Stefan Schumacher won the fifth stage of the Tirreno-
Adriatico on Sunday to take a slender overall lead of the one-
week Italian stage race.


The Gerolsteiner rider edged out compatriot Andreas Kloden in an
individual time-trial over 20.5 kilometres from Civitanova to
Civitanova Alta.


Schumacher finished in 27 minutes and eight seconds, a second
ahead of Kloden.


Schumacher leads the overall standings with Kloden in second
place and Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan third.


Tirreno-Adriatico runs between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic coasts
and is an important warm-up for the Milan-San Remo classic race,
which takes place on March 24.
