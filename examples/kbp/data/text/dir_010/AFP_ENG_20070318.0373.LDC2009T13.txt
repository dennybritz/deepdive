France's Amelie Mauresmo announced Sunday that she has pulled out
of the ATP/WTA Miami tournament after undergoing an operation for
appendicitis.


She is pulling out of the hardcourt tournament that features the
top men's and women's players in the world. Officials said the
operation was a success.


Mauresmo has not played since a February 24 loss to Belgian
Justin Henin. She is currently ranked third in the world but that
will change to fourth when the new rankings come out Monday.
