Tourists abandoned the beaches of Bali and the airport shut down
Monday as the Indonesian island's four million Hindus ushered in
the New Year in traditional silence.


On Nyepi, or the Day of Silence, Bali's Hindus refrain from work,
travel, making noise and any form of celebration. The silence and
lack of activity is believed to be a way to trick demons into
thinking there is nobody to haunt.


Some even choose not to eat for 24 hours, and the lighting of
fires is banned. Nyepi is a public holiday in Indonesia, the
world's most populous Muslim nation.


Bali's legion of tourists, who normally spent the day lounging on
the island's pristine beaches before heading to the nightclubs,
stayed in their hotel rooms to respect the occasion.


Hotels are among the few places allowed to maintain discreet
evening lighting during Nyepi. The rest of Bali falls into
darkness as the sun sets.


The only people on the island's normally bustling streets were
the Pecalang, a traditional police task force enforcing the Hindu
rules for the day.


Bali's international airport and main ferry ports were also
closed for Nyepi, which is observed until 6:00 am on Tuesday
(2200 GMT Monday).


Many Indian Hindus celebrate New Year in October or November
during Diwali, the Festival of Lights, which is marked by noisy
firework displays and wild celebrations.
