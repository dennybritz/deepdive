Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen's Centre Party held a slim
lead in legislative elections Sunday, closely trailed by the
opposition Conservatives, a projection by YLE television showed.


The Centre Party, which has governed in a centre-left coalition
with the Social Democrats and the tiny Swedish People's Party
since 2003, was credited with 23.1 percent of votes.


The Conservative National Coalition Party was in second place,
with 22.3 percent of votes, while the Social Democrats appeared
to be the big losers of the election in third place with 21.5
percent.


Political leaders voiced caution about the result.


"It's too close to call," Vanhanen said.


In Finland the biggest party traditionally occupies the post of
prime minister, building a parliamentary majority with junior
partners.


If the Centre Party were to be confirmed as the biggest party,
Vanhanen could form a coalition with the Conservatives, but he
could also, theoretically, choose to continue with the Social
Democrats as long as the two parties held a majority of the 200
seats in parliament.


With more than 80 percent of actual votes counted, the Centre
Party was credited with 25.3 percent, while the Social Democrats
had 21.8 percent and the Conservatives 21.0 percent.


However, many votes had not yet been counted in the southern part
of Finland, the most heavily populated area of the country
including the capital Helsinki where support for the
Conservatives was strong.
