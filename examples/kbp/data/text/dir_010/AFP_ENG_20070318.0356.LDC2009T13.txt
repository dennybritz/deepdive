A British army helicopter has crashed near a housing estate in
south Armagh, Northern Ireland, a spokesman for the Police
Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) told AFP on Sunday.


"We have an ongoing incident involving a military helicopter....
It's understood that an aircraft came down... just shortly before
6:00 pm this evening," a PSNI spokesman said.


The helicopter, which crashed at about 5:55 p.m. (1755 GMT), was
transporting a group consisting of six soldiers and members of
the PSNI. Ambulances have been rushed to the scene, though the
extent of the injuries is not yet clear. There have so far been
no reports of fatalities.


A spokeswoman for the British defence ministry could not
immediately confirm the crash.
