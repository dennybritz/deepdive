Some 6,000 people on Sunday descended on the southern Spanish
hamlet of Orgiva for a festival which annually gathers hippies
from around the country and beyond to welcome the start of
spring, police said.


Several thousand traditionally gather in Orgiva, about 50
kilometres (30 miles) south of Granada, to bid farewell to winter
although local authorities did not officially sanction the event,
Spain's answer to Britain's Stonehenge summer solstice festival.


Spanish media said the so-called "Dragonfest" went off without
incident, save for several cases of police confiscating drugs and
penknives found on a handful of partygoers.


Five years ago the festival on the banks of the River Guadalfeo
in the Alpujarras mountains was marked by tragedy when a Briton
and a Frenchwoman were found dead. Both deaths were widely
believed to be drug-related.


The deaths prompted local authorities to issue a prohibition
order the following year, but the festival has survived, despite
isolated local protests about the noise or some participants, in
the words of organisers, "freaking out a few locals with (their)
anarchic unpredictability."


The festival, which began on the March 1997 spring Equinox, is
one of a number of such gatherings of youths in Spain publicised
through word of mouth or, increasingly in recent years, through
the Internet and by text message.
