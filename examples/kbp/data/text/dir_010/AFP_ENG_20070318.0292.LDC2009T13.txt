German Vice Chancellor Franz Muentefering said Sunday that
Europe's biggest economy would grow this year "by at least 1.9
percent," more than the 1.7 percent officially forecast.


Muentefering, who is also Germany's labor minister, was speaking
at an industry event in the western city of Duesseldorf.


The government's latest official forecast for 2007 was a 1.7
percent expansion of the gross domestic product but several
officials had given a more bullish outlook.


Leading economic institutes have predicted between 2.0 and 2.8
percent growth this year.


The government raised value-added tax from 16 percent to 19
percent with effect from January 1, in a move that critics said
could strangle consumer spending and put a drag on economic
activity as a whole.


But many experts believe the German economy, currently in boom,
is resilient enough to shrug off the negative effects of the VAT
hike.


In 2006, the German economy already notched up growth of 2.5
percent, the fastest rate of growth in six years.
