The United States and Pyongyang have reached a deal to release
North Korean funds frozen in Macau, clearing the way for progress
in nuclear disarmament talks, a senior US official said here
Monday.


"The United States and the North Korean government have reached
an understanding on this position of DPRK-related funds frozen at
Banco Delta Asia," deputy assistant US Treasury secretary Daniel
Glaser told reporters.


All of the roughly 25 million dollars frozen in the Macau-based
bank since 2005 due to accusations of money laundering and
counterfeiting would be released back to North Korea, he said.
