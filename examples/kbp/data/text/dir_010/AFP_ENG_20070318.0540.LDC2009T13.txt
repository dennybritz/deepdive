Tiger Airways has set up a subsidary in Australia after getting
regulatory approval, the Singapore-based budget carrier said
Monday.


Tiger Airways Australia Pty Ltd was incorporated Friday in the
country's Northern Territory state where its capital city,
Darwin, was the airline's first Australian destination, it said
in a statement.


The carrier, 49 percent owned by Singapore Airlines, last month
announced plans to expand into the Australian market by the end
of the year, a move that would pit it against the likes of flag
carrier Qantas and Virgin Blue.


"Tiger Airways' first destination in Australia from Singapore was
Darwin and we look forward to the further expansion of our
business in the territory," chief executive Tony Davis said in a
statement.


Last week, Tiger Airways said it has received Australian approval
to fly to the western city of Perth in Western Australia state,
the carrier's second destination after Darwin.


Starting March 23, the carrier will fly four times a week to
Perth and intends to expand the schedule to a daily basis from
May onwards, instead of November as originally planned.


Tiger, which began flying in 2004, flies from Singapore to
destinations in Southeast Asia and China.


The carrier is owned by four shareholders, including Singapore
Airlines and state-linked Singapore investment firm Temasek
Holdings with 11 percent.


Irishman Tony Ryan, founder of the wildly successful Ryanair,
also has a 16 percent stake.
