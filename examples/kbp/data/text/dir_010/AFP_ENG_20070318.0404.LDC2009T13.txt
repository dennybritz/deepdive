Madrid's renowned El Corral de la Moreria, flamenco venue will
Wednesday give music a back seat and unveil a collection of
paintings by famed dancer La Chunga.


La Chunga, born Micaela Flores Amaya, will be on hand to present
works which once enchanted Pablo Picasso.


Amaya, born to Andalusian gypsy immigrant parents in the French
city of Marseille in 1938, moved to Barcelona and became a
talented dancer as a childhood.


But she also developed a talent for painting in a highly
personalised style which Picasso dubbed "shining naif".


Although it was her dancing, and later her acting, which first
brought renown, Picasso's praise helped earn equal admiration
from the art world and prompted Madrid's Fine Arts Circle to
award her its gold medal for artistic achievement.


El Corral, which last year celebrated 50 years as one of Spain's
most famous flamenco venues will showcase a range of pictures by
La Chunga. The collection goes on show Wednesday for a month.
