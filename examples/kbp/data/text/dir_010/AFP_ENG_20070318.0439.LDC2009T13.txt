Russia has banned imports of rice and other agricultural crops
from Pakistan starting Monday, the Interfax news agency reported
quoting Russia veterinary officials.


The ban, which would also cover Pakistani products imported from
other countries, was decided upon after a lab in Russia's
southern city of Krasnodar reported live pests and larvae of the
Khapra beetle in a rice shipment from Pakistan. The shipment was
stopped at Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.


The Khapra beetle can destroy up to 30 percent of the stored
grain in a season, "an equivalent of plague in veterinary
medicine," the service's chief Sergey Dankvert was quoted as
saying.


The ban could be lifted only after Russian experts check
Pakistan's health certification system, the service said.
