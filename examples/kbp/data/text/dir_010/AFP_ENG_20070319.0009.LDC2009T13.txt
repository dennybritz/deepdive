New Zealand will expand its military deployment to troubled East
Timor, Prime Minister Helen Clark said Monday.


New Zealand would send two air force helicopters and an extra 32
personnel  to join the Australian-led Combined Joint Task Force
and the United Nations restoring stability to the fledgling
nation, Clark told a press conference.


New Zealand already has more than 150 troops and 25 police
serving there.


"Obviously this is happening at what is potentially a more
volatile period in the run up to the presidential elections in
Timor," Clark said.


The presidential elections are due next month and there are fears
fugitive soldier Major Alfredo Reinado could trigger further
unrest during the poll period.


Reinado is on the run after Australian troops stormed his base
but failed to capture him earlier this month. Four of his armed
supporters were killed, sparking protests in the capital and
elsewhere.


He was implicated in unrest last year which killed at least 37
people, forced 150,000 from their homes and triggered the
dispatch of the Australian-led peacekeeping force to quell the
violence.


The presidential vote on April 9 will be the first since East
Timor gained independence in 1999 after 24 years of occupation by
neighbouring Indonesia.
