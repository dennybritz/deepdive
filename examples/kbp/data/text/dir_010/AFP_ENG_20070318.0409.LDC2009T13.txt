At least seven people died on Sunday after a bus smashed into a
lorry near an exclusive Kenyan coastal resort, rescue officials
said.


"Many passengers have died ... we have managed to pull out seven
bodies, but I can see other bodies still trapped inside the
wreckage and they are possibly dead," said an official from the
Kenya Red Cross Society.


The bus collided with a truck near the Indian Ocean resort of
Malindi, about 450 kilometres (281 miles) southeast of Nairobi.


Road accidents are frequent in the east African nation, home to
at least 32 million people, where traffic regulations are
routinely violated or ignored and road conditions are often poor.
