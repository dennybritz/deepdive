British Airways was forced to apologise after placing the body of
a woman who had died three hours into a London-New Delhi flight
in a vacant first-class seat, media reports said Monday.


After the elderly woman died, the flight's cabin crew moved her
from her economy class seat into a vacant first class seat,
strapped her in with a seatbelt, and propped her up with pillows.


Her daughter was given a vacant seat next to her, and reportedly
spent most of the remaining five-odd hours of the flight wailing
and in tears.


A passenger seated nearest to the corpse, identified by the Daily
Mirror only as Paul, told the paper of how the crew had not
informed him that the woman had died mid-flight.


"I went to the galley and said, 'She doesn't look too well'," the
54-year-old businessman told the Mirror.


"The crew told me, 'We put out a call to the doctor but it was
too late. She's expired.'"


He added that "because of turbulence it (the body) kept slipping
down on to the floor. It was horrific."


A spokesman for BA was quoted by the Mirror as saying: "We
apologise, but our crew were working in difficult circumstances
and chose the option they thought would cause least disruption."


According to The Guardian, about 10 people a year die on BA
flights, and the airline acted in a similar fashion when an
American traveller died half-way through a six-hour London-Boston
flight in November.


The man was covered with a blanket and strapped into a reclining
first-class seat.
