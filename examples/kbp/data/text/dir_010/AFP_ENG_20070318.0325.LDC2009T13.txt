Charlton striker Darren Bent is a major doubt for England's Euro
2008 qualifiers according to manager Alan Pardew.


Bent played 83 minutes of Charlton's 2-0 win over Newcastle on
Sunday, despite being less than 100 percent fit as he struggles
with a knee injury.


Charlton boss Pardew admitted he took a gamble picking Bent and
claimed the striker was almost certain to have to withdraw from
England's squad to face Israel and Andorra.


"I made the call yesterday on Darren, although he's not 100 per
cent and I don't think England duty would be right for him or for
England," Pardew said.


"He's not quite right as he's got pain in his medial ligament.
I'll send him to be assessed by England but I think in all
honestly he won't make it."


If Bent does pull out, England coach Steve McClaren, who would be
left with just three fit strikers, is likely to call up Preston's
in-form David Nugent, who has scored 16 goals for the
Championship side this season.
