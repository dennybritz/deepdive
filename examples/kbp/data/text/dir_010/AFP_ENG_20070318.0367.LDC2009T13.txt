Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen's Centre Party held a slim
lead in Sunday's legislative election with the opposition
Conservatives close on its heels, a projection by YLE television
showed.


The Centre Party, which has governed in a centre-left coalition
with the Social Democrats and the tiny Swedish People's Party
since 2003, was credited with 23.0 percent of votes.


The Conservative National Coalition Party was in second place,
with 22.1 percent of votes, while the Social Democrats were in
third place with 21.8 percent.
