Australian smokers have even fewer places in which to confidently
light up after a Sydney council named parks and bus stops as
smoke-free zones.


Mosman Council last week agreed to fine offenders 110 dollars
(87.50 US) for smoking in parks, public squares, underground
carparks and enclosed bus shelters in the affluent northern
Sydney suburb, mayor Denise Wilton said on Monday.


Wilton said the new regulations were a natural progression for
the council which three years ago outlawed the increasingly anti-
social practice on beaches, sporting ovals and other council
premises.


Smoking is already banned from most areas of pubs and clubs in
New South Wales state and the practice will be totally banned in
enclosed spaces in licenced premises from July this year.


"We're responding to the community," Wilton said of the new ban.
"They (residents) have been really happy with it."


Smokers will now only be able to light up in the smoking
designated areas of restaurants and on the street if they wish to
smoke in public, she said.


Hong Kong and parts of the United States are among other
territories and countries to have banned smoking in public parks.
