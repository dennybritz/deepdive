France's leftist Green Party on Sunday condemned the arrest of an
Italian ex- revolutionary who had lived in France for many years.


The country's Socialists, however, said international extradition
rules must be respected in the case of Cesare Battisti, who was
arrested in Brazil on Sunday.


The arrest of Battisti was "the result of the French state not
respecting its commitments when it comes to those who have
renounced violence," a Green Party spokesman said.


Battisti, 52, disappeared from France in 2004 shortly before the
French government signed an extradition order to return him to
Italy, where he has been convicted in absentia for four murders.


He had lived in France since 1990 and made a living as a crime
writer, and supporters in France had taken up his cause.


Battisti benefitted from a policy instituted by then Socialist
president Francois Mitterrand under which Italian left-wing
extremists could stay in France if they abandoned their
commitment to armed struggle.


Socialist Party official Stephane Le Foll said Sunday that his
fleeing France had changed the circumstances.


"He fled, so it's his responsibility," he said. "He didn't have
to do it. Now he must be extradited."
