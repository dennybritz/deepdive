Just a quarter of people in the five biggest European Union
countries think that their lives have got better since their
country joined the EU, according to a poll published on Monday.


The Financial Times/Harris survey, which queried citizens of
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and also the United
States, found that just 25 percent of respondents thought their
lives had improved since their country became a member of the EU.


Some 44 percent said their lives had got worse.


That did not mean that they wanted to leave the community,
however, with only 22 percent of Europeans questioned saying
their country would be better off if it withdrew from the
27-nation bloc, compared to 40 percent who thought it would be
worse off.


The poll also found that 35 percent of respondents thought that
the EU constitution would have a positive impact on their
country, against 27 percent who thought the opposite.


German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged on Friday to have a
roadmap to push forward a reworked constitution by June, warning
member countries that failure to adopt it by 2009 would be a
missed opportunity.


The constitution project was put on hold nearly two years ago
after French and Dutch voters rejected the draft text.


The FT/Harris poll involved questioning 6,772 adults in the five
EU countries and the United States between February 28 and March
12.
