A British army helicopter crashed near a Northern Ireland housing
estate Sunday injuring six British soldiers and police, officials
said.


The helicopter crashed in south Armagh and of the seven people on
board, four police officers and two military personnel were
injured and taken to hospital.


Local police said later that three of the police officers in
hospital were released after treatment, though the fourth would
have to remain after suffering a serious back injury.


The two military personnel also remain in hospital.


The seventh person on the craft emerged unhurt.


According to police, there was no indication that the crash was
terrorist- related.


The area surrounding the accident was sealed off so that a full
examination could commence in daylight, with a military inquiry
set to follow.


Police confirmed that ambulance crews taking the injured to the
hospital were attacked by local youths, who threw stones,
fireworks and snowballs, with similar attacks made on police
officers at the scene.


There were no reports of casualties, however.


Sinn Fein MP Conor Murphy, the parliamentarian for the area, said
earlier: "It is apparent that there may have been loss of life or
serious injury, although early indications suggest that no
civilians have been injured."
