The United States and Pyongyang have struck a deal to release
North Korean funds frozen in Macau, clearing the way for progress
in nuclear disarmament talks, a senior US official said here
Monday.


"The United States and the North Korean government have reached
an understanding on this position of DPRK-related funds frozen at
Banco Delta Asia," deputy assistant US Treasury secretary Daniel
Glaser told reporters.


All of the roughly 25 million dollars frozen in the Macau-based
bank since 2005 due to accusations of money laundering and
counterfeiting would be released back to North Korea, he said.


"North Korea has pledged... that these funds will be used solely
for the betterment of the North Korean people, including for
humanitarian and educational purposes," Glaser said.


"We believe this resolves the issue of the DPRK-related frozen
funds," he added, referring to North Korea by its official
acronym.


The announcement came shortly before the start of another round
of six-nation talks in Beijing aimed at ending North Korea's
nuclear weapons programme.


North Korea had insisted that it would not agree to implementing
a disarmanent deal reached in the six-party forum last month
until the dispute over the financial sanctions had been resolved.


Under the February 13 deal, North Korea would get badly needed
energy aid and diplomatic concessions in return for shutting down
its nuclear programmes.


The talks involve the two Koreas, China, the United States, Japan
and Russia.
