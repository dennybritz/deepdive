Indonesia has raised the alert level for Mount Talang on Sumatra
island following increased smoke and tremors, a vulcanologist
said Monday.


"The status was raised on March 17 at 7:00 pm," said Dalifa
Marjusi from the local vulcanology office.


Marjusi said increased activity has been reported from the peak
of the 2,597-metre (8,673 foot) high volcano in West Sumatra
province, prompting the rise to three of four possible levels.


"The smoke is reaching heights of up to 800 metres (2,672 feet),"
he told AFP.


He said local Solok district authorities were immediately
notified of the rise. A coordination meeting was held on Sunday
night with district authorities to prepare for a possible
eruption should the alert level reach four.


The Solok district chief, Gusmal, told AFP some 41,000 people may
need to be evacuated from the slope of the mountain should an
eruption prove imminent.


"There is yet no plan to evacuate them, but we are now preparing
in case the alert status is raised," Gusmal said.


More than 25,000 residents were evacuated in April 2005 from the
slopes of Mount Talang as the volcano heightened its rumbling and
spewed volcanic ash.


Indonesia sits on the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire", where
continental plates meet and cause frequent volcanic and seismic
activity.
