Japan on Monday experienced its first partial solar eclipse in
two and a half years, but only the most dedicated sky gazers in
the Land of the Rising Sun were likely to notice.


The moon crept over the sun for 26 minutes from 0233 GMT in parts
of Japan and elsewhere in East Asia and Siberia.


Partial eclipses of the sun occur when the moon intersects the
path between the sun and the earth, hiding the sun.


But experts said solar gazers had to be very attentive to catch
the latest phenomenon with the naked eye.


"The eclipse wasn't very visible. Only about 10 percent of the
sun was eclipsed, so unless you watched carefully or used a
telescope, you wouldn't notice any change," said a spokesman for
Japan's National Astronomical Observatory.


The eclipse was not noticeable at all from Tokyo. It was better
seen from the southwestern islands of Kyushu and Shikoku or the
northern island of Hokkaido.


The partial solar eclipse is the first to be observed in Japan
since October 2004, the spokesman said.


Those who missed the latest eclipse will have to wait until July
22, 2009 to see it again in Japan.
