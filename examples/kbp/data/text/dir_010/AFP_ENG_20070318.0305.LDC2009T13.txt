The British capital turned green, white and orange on Sunday as
thousands of revellers took to the streets of London, wrapping a
week of St. Patrick's Day celebrations.


Some 11,000 people, according to police, pitched up at locations
around the city for the annual traditional parade in honour of
the patron saint of Ireland.


The parade snaked through central London from Hyde Park to
Trafalgar Square.


Party-goers there were treated to a festival of Irish dance,
music and food, as well as marching bands from Britain, Ireland
and the United States, organisers said.
