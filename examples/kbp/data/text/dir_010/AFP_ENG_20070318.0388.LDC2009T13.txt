Pakistan will still play their final World Cup group match
against Zimbabwe despite the death of coach Bob Woolmer, the
team's media manager told AFP on Sunday.


Media manager P.J. Mir confirmed that Woolmer had died Sunday
morning and said the cause of death would be ascertained "once
the hospital has done the autopsy and the medical history."


"The Pakistan team will continue its participation in the
tournament. We are due to play Zimbabwe and we will play that
match," Mir told AFP by telephone from Jamaica.


Pakistan, the 1992 champions, suffered a stunning World Cup exit
at the hands of Ireland on Saturday. Woolmer told AFP hours
before his death that the loss had left him "deeply hurt".


Pakistan face Zimbabwe on Wednesday.


"Obviously the boys are extremely sad, they are very distrubred,
they are shocked, it's a very shocking happening. But the boys
have to play the match and they will," Mir said.
