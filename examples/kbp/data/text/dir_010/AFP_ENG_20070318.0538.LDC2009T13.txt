Kobe Bryant scored 50 points, his second stunning scoring effort
in three nights, to lead the Los Angeles Lakers past Minnesota
109-102 in a National Basketball Association game here Sunday.


Bryant, who tagged Portland for 65 points in a victory on Friday,
made 17-of-32 shots as the Lakers improved to 35-32 with back-to-
back victories after a six- game losing streak.


By reaching 50 points for the fifth time this season and 16th
time in his career, Bryant became the first Lakers player since
Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor in 1962 to score 50 points in
consecutive games.


Bryant scored 14 points in a 27-6 first-quarter run and added 16
points in the third period to lift the Lakers ahead 87-68. After
the Timberwolves clawed back, Bryant scored 10 points in the last
four minutes to seal victory.


Bryant became the ninth player to reach 40 points against
Minnesota twice, having achieved both within 13 days after never
scoring more than 39 before. He scored 40 in a double-overtime
victory over Minnesota on March 6.


Smush Parker added 19 points and Luke Walton contributed 10
points and 11 assists for the Lakers, who are sixth in the
Western Conference.


Ricky Davis scored 33 points and Kevin Garnett added 26 points
and 15 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who fell to 32-36 and
dropped 2 1/2 games behind Golden States for the last Western
Conference playoff berth.
