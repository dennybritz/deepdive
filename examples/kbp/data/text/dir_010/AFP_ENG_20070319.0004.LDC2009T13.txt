Hong Kong share prices ended the Monday morning session 0.96
percent higher led by China Mobile and other blue chips on
expectations that they will release strong earnings this week,
dealers said.


They said fresh talk of A-share listings in China by some Hong
Kong-listed firms also helped sentiment.


China's interest rate hike announcement over the weekend had a
muted impact on the market as the move had been largely expected
following recent economic data on the mainland, they said.


Chinese markets put on sharp gains despite the rate increase.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 182.37 points at
19,135.87, off a low of 18,967.41 and a high of 19,137.87.
