Four people were killed when an avalanche buried snowmobilers on
a mountain in Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, police said
Monday.


The victims were engulfed by the massive snowslide Sunday while
they were on a snowmobile tour of 1,255-metre (4,142-foot) Mount
Shakotan, a popular skiing spot, police spokesman said.


Some 60 police and troops were deployed and recovered three
bodies Monday morning, a day after finding the first one at the
mountain some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Hokkaido's largest
city Sapporo.


One survivor fractured a hip while the remaining 17 people were
rescued safely or got down the mountain by themselves, the
spokesman said.


Japan has had a mild winter with less snow than usual, a trend
some experts link to global warming.
