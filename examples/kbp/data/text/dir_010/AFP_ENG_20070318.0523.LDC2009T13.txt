South Korea's ginseng and tobacco monopoly KTG said Monday it
will build its first overseas plant in Turkey to boost sales in
Europe and the Middle East.


The company said the 50 billion won (52.8 million dollars)
factory with an annual production capacity of two billion
cigarettes would be set up in an industrial complex near Izmir.


KTG hopes to complete the construction this year and start sales
in Turkey next year.


KTG said Turkey, the world's seventh-largest tobacco consumer,
would help the company secure a bridgehead in the European
market. Turkey is also close to the Middle East, another key
export market for the Korean company.


KTG sold about 350 million dollars worth of tobacco in 40
countries last year.
