Former Formula One racer Juan Pablo Montoya of Colombia drove to
a fifth-place finish Sunday at the Kobalt 500, his best showing
so far on the prime US stock car circuit since making the switch.


Montoya was an open-wheel star in Indy-car before his F1 days and
is quickly becoming a force in the National Association for Stock
Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) scene after winning a development-series
race in Mexico earlier this month.


"I loved it. It was a great job," Montoya said. "My pit stops
were amazing.  It is nice to get a top-five here. We're getting
the hang of it."


Defending season points champion Jimmie Johnson passed Tony
Stewart with two laps remaining and held on to capture the
victory, the 25th of his career in the closed-cockpit series.


The title chase resumes next Sunday at Bristol, Tennessee, where
Montoya was among drivers testing the new "Car of Tomorrow" last
month who were concerned about how the car would handle the
.533-mile oval.


"If you ask the guys who have been here before they'll probably
say (the new car) is horrible," Montoya said after the test
session.


"I've never been here in the other cars so I didn't know what to
expect. From that point of view maybe I have an advantage.


"I think you would be lucky to make it to the end. This is a
track where you would have to be happy just to bring the car
home. You've just got to be at the right place at the right time
the whole race if you're going to finish."
