Britain will stop using so-called "dumb" cluster bombs, which
have killed and injured thousands of civilians, Defence Secretary
Des Browne is to tell parliament on Tuesday, The Guardian said.


Citing unnamed defence officials, the newspaper said that Browne
had written to Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett and
International Development Secretary Hilary Benn to say that his
decision, which will take immediate effect, was made on
humanitarian grounds.


A cluster bomb is a container holding hundreds of smaller
bomblets. It opens in mid-air and disperses the bomblets over a
large area.


The smaller bombs do not always explode on impact, which means
they can continue to kill innocent civilians years later.


In his letter, Browne referred to efforts to win "hearts and
minds" in Afghanistan, where the role of British security forces
is not just about "creating security".


British armed forces will still retain their "smart" cluster
bombs, however, which self-destruct immediately, as defence
officials argue that they do not pose a threat to civilians.


Last month at a conference in Norway, 46 countries pledged to
seek a treaty banning cluster bombs by next year, with France and
Britain among the countries that signed on.


Japan, Poland and Romania refused to sign the accord, while key
nations such as Israel and the United States did not take part in
the conference.
