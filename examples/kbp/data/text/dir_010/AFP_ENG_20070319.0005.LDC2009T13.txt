Malaysia has launched an aggressive year-long campaign against
illegal loan sharks and to educate the public on the consequences
of borrowing from them, a report said Monday.


A committee comprising five ministries, the police and a crime
prevention foundation has been formed to fight illegal lenders,
deputy Internal Security Minister Fu Ah Kiow said.


"The Ah Long menace has reached a worrying stage and they have
become a public nuisance. We have to come down hard on them
because it is getting out of hand," Fu told the Star daily. Ah
Long is the local term for such lenders.


Loan sharks, who charge much higher interest rates than normal
lenders, are accused of resorting to violent and criminal means
to harass errant borrowers.


Under the one-year campaign, police will track down loan sharks
who have been freely distributing their flyers and brochures.


Legal money lenders will also be closely monitored to ensure they
comply with the rules and regulations on lending, Fu said.


The issuance of new money lending licenses will be frozen, while
the Finance Ministry will consider providing micro-credit loans
to Malaysians, he added.


In February, the government shot down police proposals to
prosecute borrowers for going to loan sharks, deciding instead to
tackle the lenders.
