Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen's Centre Party took the
lead in Sunday's legislative elections with almost 40 percent of
votes counted, officials said.


The Centre Party was credited with 24.8 percent of votes, while
its junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, were credited
with 22.9 percent.


The opposition Conservative National Coalition Party was
meanwhile seen winning 21.8 percent.


Observers stressed that the partial result may not be
representative of the overall election result, as it includes the
votes of the 29.2 percent of the electorate who chose to vote in
advance, traditionally those in rural areas where support for the
formerly agrarian Centre Party is strongest.
