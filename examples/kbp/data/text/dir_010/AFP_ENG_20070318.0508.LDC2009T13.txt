Hong Kong share prices rose Monday in early trade as optimism
over plans for the A-share listing here of major mainland firms
offset concerns over China's interest rate hike, dealers said.


The Hang Seng Index opened up 0.28 percent, or 52.65 points, at
19,006.15.


Dealers said the 27-basis point rise in China's lending rate had
a muted effect on the market amid positive sentiment over the
Hong Kong listing plans of China Mobile and other major companies
like China Netcom and China Telecom.


The market was also buoyed by expectations for strong earnings
announcements this week from China Mobile and others companies
including Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong, they added.
