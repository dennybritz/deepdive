While the Palestinian Authority wants to become more self-
sufficient, it will need aid for development "for a long time",
the incoming Palestinian finance minister said in an interview
published on Monday.


Speaking to The Times, Salam Fayyad also said that the "biggest
challenge" for him was cutting the PA's inflated payroll, but
noted that there are "constraints" that meant he would not be
able to reduce it quickly.


"A key priority is to try to put the finances of the PA on a more
sustainable path ... to reduce our need for external assistance,"
Fayyad was quoted as saying by the daily, just a day after the
PA's coalition cabinet met for the first time.


He added, however: "We are going to need financial assistance for
development needs for a long time.


"But as far as financial assistance for current expenditure is
concerned, it is our hope that it will be possible for us to come
up with a financial policy consistent with the need to graduate
from that kind of exeptional support over the medium term."


Fayyad is the leader of the Third Way bloc, part of the national
unity government formed by Hamas and rival party Fatah.


The Hamas-led government has been boycotted by major countries
the world over for failing to renounce violence, recognise Israel
and accept past peace deals signed by previous Palestinian
governments.
