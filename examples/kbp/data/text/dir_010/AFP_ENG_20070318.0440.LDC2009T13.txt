Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq on Sunday announced his
retirement from one-day cricket after his team's humiliating exit
from the World Cup and the death of coach Bob Woolmer.


"I have talked with my father on the phone and have decided to
retire from one- day cricket after the Zimbabwe match (which will
be the team's last World Cup match on Wednesday)," Inzamam said.


The 37-year-old Pakistan captain made 36 and one respectively in
Pakistan's 54-run defeat against the West Indies and three-wicket
upset loss against Ireland in the World Cup.


Inzamam was expected to address a press conference in team's
Jamaica hotel to formally announce his decision later Sunday.


He has played 377 matches, scoring 11,702 runs with ten hundreds
and 83 fifties. He has also played 129 Tests for Pakistan.


Inzamam was part of Pakistan team which won the World Cup in
1992.
