Dirk Nowitzki scored 28 points and pulled down 12 rebounds to
give the Dallas Mavericks a 92-88 victory over Detroit in a
Sunday showdown of National Basketball Association giants.


The Mavericks improved to a league-best 54-11 by taking the
opener of their six- game road trip while the Pistons, who lead
the Eastern Conference, fell to 42-23 in what could be a preview
of June's NBA Finals.


German star Nowitzki is making a strong case for season Most
Valuable Player honors and showed peak form against the Pistons,
with game highs in points on 11-of-20 shooting as well as
rebounds, 10 of them off the defensive boards.


Devin Harris added 22 points for the Mavericks, who stretched
their Western Conference lead of Phoenix to 4 1/2 games. Both
have already clinched playoff berths.


Flip Murray led Detroit with 18 points while Antonio McDyess came
off the bench to add 17 for the Pistons, whose lead over
Cleveland was trimmed to 1 1/2 games in the fight for hoem-field
advantage through the Eastern Conference finals.


The Pistons had won 17 of their prior 21 while the Mavericks have
now won 19 of their last 21.
