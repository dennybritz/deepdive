Polling stations closed across Finland on Sunday after
legislative elections that were expected to return Prime Minister
Matti Vanhanen to power thanks to his strong economic record.


If Vanhanen emerges victorious he could choose to continue his
centre-left coalition with the Social Democrats, or shift to a
centre-right alliance with the Conservative National Coalition
Party, depending on which party garners the most support.
