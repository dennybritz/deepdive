The corpse of a new-born baby thought to have been concealed in a
domestic freezer for eight years has been discovered in a
northern Slovakian town, reports said Sunday.


The body, believed to have been frozen in 1999, was found during
the forced eviction of a family who had defaulted on their rent
in the town of Ruzomberok, television news channel TA3 reported.


Authorities launched an enquiry after receiving news of the grim
discovery on Friday, and were not able to give any further
details, TA3 cited a police spokesman as saying.


A 38-year-old mother of three is being held for questioning.
