Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday called for greater
international investment in his country, especially in the energy
sector.


Afghanistan has a "huge appetite" for energy consumption yet only
six percent of the population has a regular supply of
electricity, Karzai told journalists at the start of an official
visit to Germany.


He added that the country needed to develop infrastructure,
notably road and railway networks, before drawing attention to
the recent explosion in the mobile phone market. Up to 2.2
million Afghans now have mobile phones.


Karzai also thanked Germany for its military help in bringing
stability to the region and added that international aid was
still needed to fight the Taliban threat.


The president will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday
to discuss Germany's role in Afghanistan, including its mission
within the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), in
which Germany has nearly 3,000 troops.


Karzai -- who is to receive a leadership award during his three-
day visit -- will also travel to France to meet French
counterpart Jacques Chirac.
