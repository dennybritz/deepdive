Bad weather forced organisers to cancel a docklands fireworks
display in Dublin on Sunday, one of the highlights of Ireland's
St. Patrick's Day festival.


The cancelation was forced by "health and safety concerns," Donal
Shiels, chief executive of the festival, said in a statement.


High winds of up to 60 kilometres (37 miles) per hour on the
River Liffey made the setting up of the show impossible,"
organisers said.


A "Luminarium" lighting show was also cancelled.


Other events in the five-day festival, which began on Thursday,
were continuing. The festival ends on Monday, a national holiday
in Ireland.
