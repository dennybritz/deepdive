An British army helicopter crashed near a Northern Ireland
housing estate Sunday injuring six British soldiers and police,
officials said.


The helicopter crashed in south Armagh and of the seven people on
board, four police officers and two military personnel were
injured.


The seventh person on the craft emerged unhurt and the extent of
the injuries to the remaining six was unclear.


According to police, there was no indication that the crash was
terrorist- related.


The area surrounding the accident was sealed off so that a full
examination could commence in daylight, with a military inquiry
set to follow.


Sinn Fein MP Conor Murphy, the parliamentarian for the area, said
earlier: "It is apparent that there may have been loss of life or
serious injury, although early indications suggest that no
civilians have been injured."
