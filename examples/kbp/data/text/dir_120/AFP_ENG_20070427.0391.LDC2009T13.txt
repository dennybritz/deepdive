The UN's food relief agency said Friday that it was concerned
about the condition of tens of thousands of people in eastern
areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo who have fled renewed
fighting in recent weeks.


"About 10,000 to 100,000 more people have been displaced in South
Kivu," said the World Food Programme's senior official in the
country, Charles Vincent.


"We're worried. The displaced people are in a poor state,"
Vincent said, saying they were scattered around several different
areas in the region.


About 60 to 75 percent of cases of severe malnutrition involve
displaced people, according to the agency, which delivered 43,331
tonnes of food in the country last year.


United Nations peacekeepers this week launched a joint operation
with the DRC army in South Kivu this week to clear it of Rwandan
rebels.


However, Vincent was hopeful that political improvements in the
country would soon take hold.


"Our vision is that the WFP will no longer bring aid to the DRC
in ten years time, but will buy food there for countries nearby,"
Vincent said.


About 1.1 million Congolese are displaced in the country,
according to the UN refugee agency.
