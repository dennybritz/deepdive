Madagascar's constitutional court Friday ratified the results of
a referendum on changing the country's basic law to increase
presidential powers and make English an official language.


It endorsed with minor changes the results that showed 75.38
percent of voters backing the changes that would also change the
system of regional government from six autonomous provinces to 22
regions.


The voting on April 4 was marred by bad weather and saw a turnout
of 43.72 percent.


Opposition members complained that the exercise was marred by
fraud, but have not provided any proof.
