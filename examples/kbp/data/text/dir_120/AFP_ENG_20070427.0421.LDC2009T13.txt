Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday that the six-party
talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program
were in a "regrettable" state.


Abe, at a news conference alongside President George W. Bush at
the US leader's retreat here, also lamented North Korea's
attitude regarding the abduction of Japanese citizens.


"We agree that the current state of the six-party talks, as well
as North Korea's attitude towards the abduction issue are
regrettable and we'll work for closer coordination between our
two countries to achieve progress," Abe said.
