An Israeli delegation has declined to attend an international
conference in Bali, an organiser said Friday, following anger
among some hardline Indonesian lawmakers.


The Inter-Parliamentary Union had invited the delegation to its
conference on the Indonesian resort island starting next week.


But IPU secretary general Anders Johnsson confirmed that the
delegation had declined. He said Israeli press had reported that
all security guarantees for the delegation had not been met.


"It's really too bad. They should be here, it's precisely this
country that they should come to for talks," Johnsson told AFP.


Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has no
diplomatic ties with Israel and often sees mass street protests
condemning Israel's moves in the Middle East.


Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said earlier this
month, in response to anger from lawmakers, that he was not in a
position to bar the delegation, as the meet was being organised
by the IPU not the government.


The IPU seeks to promote democracy and has 143 national
parliaments as members. Its Bali conference runs from April 29 to
May 4.


Israel did not attend an IPU meeting in Indonesia in 2000 after
an outcry from some hardliners.
