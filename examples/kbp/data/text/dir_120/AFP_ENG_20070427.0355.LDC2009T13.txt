Spanish police said Friday they have arrested 11 people for
downloading images showing the sexual abuse of a nine-year-old
girl.


Specialist investigators tracked down the group, men aged 18 to
41, using a police online search tool, "Hispalis," which detects
the names and addresses of people connecting to illicit child
porn sites.


Those detained were picked up in a series of raids across the
country and included a student, a prison officer, an electrician
and a swimming club coach.


Only last month, Spain smashed another paedophile ring, making 15
arrests of people who downloaded large quantities of child
pornography, including 480,000 photographs.
