Turkish Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc gave the go-ahead Friday
for the first round of voting in a crucial presidential election,
in which Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is the sole candidate.


Opposition parties overwhelmingly boycotted the vote, leaving the
ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) almost on its own in
the 550-seat assembly. Ersonmez Yarbay, an AKP lawmaker who had
submitted his candidacy, withdrew from the election shortly
before it began, leaving Gul as the only candidate.


The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), which led
the boycott, plans to ask the Constitutional Court to annul the
vote on a technicality related to quorum rules and possibly force
early general elections.


Only four dissidents from opposition parties and four
independents were present in the assembly in addition to the AKP
group, which has 352 seats.


The vote was to be secret, with each deputy summoned by name to
cast a vote in a ballot box.


The CHP says the AKP, the offshoot of a now-banned Islamist
movement, is not truly committed to Turkey's secular system and
should not be allowed to elect someone from its ranks as head of
state.
