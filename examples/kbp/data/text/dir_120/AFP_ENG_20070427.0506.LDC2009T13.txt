Former US vice president and global warming activist Al Gore
discussed the problem of climate change in a meeting Friday with
UN Secretary General Ban Ki- moon, Gore said.


Gore made no statement following the meeting, but answered "of
course" with asked by a reporter if the two talked about global
warming.


Ban has rejected the idea of organizing a global summit on
climate change this year as impractical. But the UN chief has
said he supports a high-level discussion on the issue during the
annual UN General Assembly meeting in September this year.


On April 17, global warming was for the first time the subject of
discussion inside the UN Security Council, relating to the threat
it poses to peace and global security.


Since his failed 2000 presidential bid, Gore has positioned
himself as a champion of environmental issues and battling
climate change.


His documentary on global warming, "An Inconvenient Truth,"
received an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards ceremony.


His supporters are also encouraging him to join next year's race
for the US presidency.
