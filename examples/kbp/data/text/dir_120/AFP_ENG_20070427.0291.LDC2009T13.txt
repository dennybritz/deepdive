The US economy expanded at a worse-than-expected 1.3 percent rate
in the first quarter, the slowest in four years, the government
said Friday.


Growth weakened amid a widespread housing slump from an
annualized 2.5-percent clip in the prior quarter.


The first snapshot on 2007 growth disappointed Wall Street
analysts who had expected growth of at least 1.8 percent.
