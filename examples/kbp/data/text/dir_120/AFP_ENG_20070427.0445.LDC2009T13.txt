Turkey's main opposition on Friday asked the Constitutional Court
to annul the first round of a presidential vote in parliament on
the grounds that it violated procedural rules.


"We asked in our application for the annulment of the first-round
vote and the suspension (of the election process) until the
ruling is made," Onder Sav, a senior member of the Republican
People's Party said outside the court.
