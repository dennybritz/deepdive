Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas arrived in Cairo Friday for a
two-day visit in which he is expected to hold talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak over regional developments, an airport
source told AFP.


He is also expected to meet exiled Hamas political supremo Khaled
Meshaal who is currently in the Egyptian capital, a Hamas
representative in Cairo told AFP.


Talks between the two Palestinians are to focus on the political
partnership between Hamas and main rival Fatah, which is headed
by Abbas, and on Palestinian efforts to lift Western economic and
diplomatic sanctions.


A Palestinian unity government, putting Fatah and Hamas around
the same cabinet table for the first time, took office on March
17 after Abbas and Meshaal reached a power-sharing agreement in
Saudi Arabia on February 8.


That deal sought to end months of factional fighting between
Fatah and Hamas supporters that left scores dead after Meshaal's
Islamist party won Palestinian legislative elections in January
2006.


The new government has since battled to end the diplomatic and
economic boycott imposed by the West on the previous Hamas-led
government for its refusal to recognise Israel and past Israeli-
Palestinian agreements.
