Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf confirmed Friday his
country's parliament will vote on his re-election before it is to
be dissolved for general polls due later this year or early in
2007.


"It is the people of Pakistan who will decide whether to elect me
and to have me as the president or not," Musharraf told
journalists during a visit to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.


"My election will be held two months before the national
elections by the assembly of Pakistan."


The move was labelled unconstitutional by opposition parties when
it was announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz earlier
in April.


Pakistani opposition parties say Musharraf, a military leader who
seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, should be elected by
the legislature after the parliamentary polls.


In response to a question on whether he had been in talks with
exiled former premier Benazir Bhutto and her opposition party,
Musharraf said: "The political environment in the election will
be exactly as it is now in Pakistan.


"There will be no change ... all that we are assuring the whole
world is that it is going to be very fair and transparent
election."


There has been speculation that Bhutto could return home to stand
in elections and lend support to Musharraf, who has faced growing
opposition in his homeland over his leadership.


Bhutto said earlier this month that she would make no deals with
Musharraf until he gives up his position as army chief.


Musharraf did not answer a question on whether he was ready to
make such a move.
