Troubled Italian airline Alitalia said Friday it planned to
cancel nearly half of its flights on May 3 because of a 24-hour
strike by flight attendants.


The 356 flight cancellations out of a total of 711 included 202
domestic and 154 international flights, with 30,000 passengers
set to be inconvenienced, Alitalia said.


The company said trade union representatives had been
intransigent at "a delicate" time for the airline, referring to
the Italian government's plans to sell a 39.9-percent stake in
the airline.


The strike is "more serious" given the positive trend since the
start of the year in terms of traffic and passengers transported,
which will be "seriously compromised" by the strike, the group
said.
