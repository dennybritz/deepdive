US President George W. Bush endorsed apologies reaffirmed Friday
by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over "comfort women" forced
into sexual slavery by Japan's military.


Abe renewed his apologies over the issue after sparking an uproar
last month by saying there was no evidence the imperial army
directly coerced thousands of women into brothels across Asia
during World War II.


"The comfort women issue was a regrettable chapter in the history
of the world and I accept the prime minister's apology," Bush
told a news conference after talks with the Japanese leader.


Abe said he felt "deep-hearted sympathies" for the plight of the
women "and I as prime minister of Japan express my apologies."
