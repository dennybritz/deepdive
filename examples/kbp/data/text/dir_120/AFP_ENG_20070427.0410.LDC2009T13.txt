A British Lynx helicopter that crashed in southern Iraq last May,
killing five military personnel on board, was shot down by a
surface-to-air missile, the government said on Friday.


Armed Forces Adam Ingram wrote in a statement to parliament that
a military board of inquiry concluded the aircraft was "shot down
by a surface-to-air missile (using a Man-Portable Air Defence
System) fired from the ground."


The crash in Basra on May 6, 2006 saw the first British
servicewoman to be killed in the line of duty in Iraq, Flight
Lieutenant Sarah Mulvihill, 32.


It also provoked bloody clashes on the ground when British troops
sent to recover the dead from the wreckage clashed with an angry
mob in the Al-Rabbat district.


Local police said at the time that the helicopter was downed by a
rocket, but the British military and government have not
confirmed that until now.
