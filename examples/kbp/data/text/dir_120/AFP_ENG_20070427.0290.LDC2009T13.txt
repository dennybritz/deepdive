The European single currency jumped to an historic peak of 1.3682
dollars in afternoon trade here on Friday after new data revealed
a marked slowdown in US economic growth.


The new record -- which beat the previous pinnacle of 1.3666
dollars that was set on December 30, 2004 -- comes also as the
euro draws strength from favourable interest rate differentials
amid strong eurozone growth.
