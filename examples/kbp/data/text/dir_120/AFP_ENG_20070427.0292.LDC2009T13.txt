Sri Lanka is agog with World Cup fever with even Buddhist monks,
Hindu and Catholic priests and Muslim clerics rallying to seek
spiritual support for the home team.


Multi-religious ceremonies of all faiths have become common ever
since Sri Lanka romped to Saturday's final against world
champions Australia in Barbados.


The local governing body of the sport, Sri Lanka Cricket, held
its own multi- faith service to bless the team.


"It is about the power of the mind," said Buddhist monk Delduwe
Gnanasumana, Sri Lanka Cricket's regular spiritual guru who
blessed the cricketers before they left for the World Cup.


Gnanasumana says his concept of "Viswa Shakthi," or the power of
the universe, should help the Sri Lankans with powers of
concentration, determination and courage to face the Australians.


The monk said his "pirith," or the chanting of religious scripts,
would begin when Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardena goes out
to toss 30 minutes before the scheduled start at 9:30 am local
time (1330 GMT).


"The power of the Viswa Shakthi will be passed on to the team and
as a result they will be doing well in the match", the monk told
AFP.


Asked if the blessings for the Sri Lankans would have an adverse
affect on the Australians, he said: "No, that is not the idea --
wishing well for one doesn't mean bad for the opponent."


Instead, the power of the blessings would bring out the virtues
of the Sri Lankan players so they would be the better team, he
said.
