The Romanian capital Bucharest will host the 20th summit of heads
of state and government from the NATO military alliance in a
year, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer announced
Friday.


"I am very pleased with this, that the next NATO summit in Spring
next year will be held in Bucharest in Romania," he told
reporters after informal NATO talks in Oslo, Norway.


"Romania is ready to organise what will be without any doubt an
important summit," he added. A NATO official said the meeting
would take place from April 2-4, 2008.


The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) holds summit
meetings roughly every two years. The last was in Riga, Latvia in
November.
