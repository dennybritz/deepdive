At least five policemen were killed in a landmine attack by
outlawed Maoist guerrillas in the central Indian state of
Chhattisgarh, police said Friday.


Eighteen others were injured in the ambush Thursday night in the
district of Kanker, some 175 kilometres (109 miles) south of
state capital Raipur, a police spokesman said.


The landmine destroyed a security vehicle, killing four
constables immediately, the official said adding seven of the
injured were critical.


Thursday's attack is the worst since March 15 when hundreds of
Maoist attacked a security post and killed at least 55 policemen
in retaliation to an anti-rebel crackdown.


Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in Chhattisgarh
by the conflict and are now living in tent shelters as Indian
counter-insurgency forces operate in the countryside.


The rebels, who launched their armed campaign in 1967, also
operate in another 14 of India's 29 states. New Delhi refuses to
negotiate with them.


Last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described the Maoists as
the single biggest threat to the nation's internal security.
