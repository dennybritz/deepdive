A US Navy Aegis cruiser simultaneously intercepted a ballistic
missile and a target simulating a hostile fighter aircraft in a
test over the Pacific, the Pentagon said.


"The test demonstrated the USS Lake Erie's ability to engage a
ballistic missile threat and defend itself from attack at the
same time," the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency said on
Thursday.


The Lake Eerie is one of a growing fleet of US warships equipped
with advanced radars and high-speed missiles capable of
intercepting short and medium range ballistic missiles.


In the test Thursday near Hawaii, the cruiser used a Standard
Missile-3 Block IA missile to intercept a target missile launched
from the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), Barking Sands,
Kauai, Hawaii.


At the same time, a US Navy aircraft launched a target designed
to mimic a high performance fighter aircraft attacking the Lake
Eeerie, which engaged it with an SM-2 missile.


The ballistic missile target was intercepted 100 miles (160
kilometers)  above the Pacific Ocean and 250 miles (402
kilometers) northwest of Kauai, marking the system's eighth
successful intercept in 10 flight tests, the agency said.
