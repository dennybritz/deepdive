Italian cyclist Damiano Cunego won the 31st edition of the Tour
of Trentino on Friday.


The 25-year-old, who rides for the Lampre team, triumphed after
retaining the overall leadership following the fourth and final
stage from Toscolano Maderno to Arco in northern Italy.


The stage was won by Argentine sprinter Ariel Maximiliano Richeze
of the Panaria team.


It is the third time Cunego has won the Tour of Trentino
following successes in 2004 and 2006.


Cunego shot to stardom in 2004 when he won the Giro D'Italia
(Tour of Italy) aged just 22.
