A Croatian museum said Friday it believes it has uncovered a
previously unknown Vincent van Gogh painting in its possession,
adding that its authenticity had been confirmed by a Dutch
expert.


An "oil painting signed 'Vincent', the author of which is
believed to be Vincent Van Gogh" was discovered in the storage of
the Zagreb Mimara museum, it said in a statement.


The painting features a group of people on a clearing in a wood
and focuses on five peasant women walking next to each other. It
was believed to have been produced by the Dutch master in 1882.


John Sillevis, a Van Gogh expert from the Netherlands, recently
"confirmed the style authenticity of the painting," the museum
said.


The museum said further research would be carried out in order to
fully confirm the painting's authenticity.


"We will look for further proof, but we are around 60 to 70
percent sure" that it was painted by Van Gogh, museum spokesman
Darko Glavan told AFP.
