Italian-based oil company Agip has agreed to buy ExxonMobil's
Esso petrol station network in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and
Hungary, the Czech news agency CTK reported Friday, citing news
releases from both companies.


The petrol station deal covers 102 Esso stations, of which 43 are
in the Czech Republic, it added. Agip's owner is Italian-state
holding company, ENI. No financial deals of the transaction were
released.


Agip currently has just over 78 petrol stations in the Czech
Republic. The Czech market leader is Unipetrol-owned Benzina,
which has around 300 stations in the country.


Benzina was also in the race to acquire the Esso stations, CTK
said.


The deal must still be cleared by regulatory authorities.
