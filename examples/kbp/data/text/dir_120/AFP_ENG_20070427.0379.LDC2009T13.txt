Serbia and Russia signed an agreement here Friday on resolving
mutual debts left over from the two countries' communist past,
Beta news agency reported.


The Russian side committed itself to honouring Soviet debts worth
288.6 million dollars owed to Serbia when it was a republic of
the former Yugoslavia, said the report.


Under the deal, Russia would put 105.5 million dollars towards
the reconstruction of "Djerdap," Serbia's main hydro-electrical
power plant located on the Danube river at the country's
northeastern border with Romania.


It would also invest the remaining sum in research equipment for
Serbia's Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences.


In addition, Russia had pledged to cancel 188 million dollars of
debt that Serbia owed to Russian energy giant Gazprom.


Following the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Serbia
inherited 288.6 million dollars of the 1.3 billion dollars in
debt owed by the former Soviet Union to the six-republic
federation.


Moscow has made separate agreements with each of the countries
formed from the breakup of Yugoslavia. It is expected to sign a
similar accord with Montenegro later on Friday.
