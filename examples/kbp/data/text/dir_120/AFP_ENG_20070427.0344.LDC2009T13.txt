Some of the 172 terror suspects arrested in Saudi Arabia were
plotting to attack oil installations and military bases,
including by aircraft, the interior ministry told AFP Friday.


"Some individuals were training to fly to carry out terrorist
attacks... Some of the cells arrested planned to target oil
installations and refineries," spokesman General Mansur al-Turki
said.


Turki, who earlier announced the arrest of 172 Saudi and foreign
terror suspects belonging to seven cells, told AFP that their
targets included "military bases in and outside" Saudi Arabia.


He said he did not know which military bases outside Saudi Arabia
were among the targets, but added that there were no foreign
military bases within the kingdom itself.


It was one of the largest swoops announced by Saudi Arabia, which
has been battling suspected Al-Qaeda militants since they
launched a wave of shootings and bombings, many targeting
Westerners, in May 2003.
