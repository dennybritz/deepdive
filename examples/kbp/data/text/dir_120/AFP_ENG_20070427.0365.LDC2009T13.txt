India's foreign investment body on Friday cleared Vodafone's 11.1
-billion-dollar plan to buy mobile phone operator Hutchison
Essar.


The decision had been delayed three times by the government as it
scrutinised Vodafone's deal to purchase India's fourth-largest
mobile company to see whether it complied with the country's
foreign investment limits.


"We are fully satisfied with the compliance level," Ajay Dua,
secretary of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion,
told reporters after a meeting of the Foreign Investment
Promotion Board.


Britain's Vodafone Group Plc agreed in February to buy Hong Kong-
based Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd's (HTIL)
67-percent controlling interest in Hutchison Essar.
