Malaysia's central bank on Friday kept its key interest rate
unchanged at 3.50 percent amid expectations of sustained economic
growth and low inflation.


The central Bank Negara said its monetary policy committee had
decided to leave the overnight policy rate at 3.50 percent.


"The current level of the policy rate remains consistent with the
medium term outlook of relatively low and stable inflation and
sustainable economic growth," it said in a statement.


The bank said it expected moderate growth in the United States,
which would in turn lead to a moderation in Malaysia's export
growth in the first half of 2007, but said economic growth would
be sustained by domestic demand.


"While this external environment may result in slower growth in
the first half of the year, for the year as a whole, the
Malaysian economy is expected to experience sustained growth," it
said.


On the outlook for inflation, the central bank said there
continued to "be a lack of underlying inflationary pressures in
the economy."


Bank Negara last month said average inflation for 2007 was
expected to be lower at between 2.0 and 2.5 percent compared to
3.6 percent in 2006 due to moderating oil prices.


"The expectation going forward is that the average rate of
inflation for the year would remain within the forecasted range
of 2.0 to 2.50 percent," it said Friday.
