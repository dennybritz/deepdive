David Ferrer on Friday assured the hosts a place in the semi-
finals of the Barcelona Open as he defeated Argentine David
Nalbandian 7-6 (7/5), 6-2.


Ferrer, seeded fifth, was awaiting the winner as top seeded two-
time champion Rafael Nadal faced a quarter-final against Italy's
Potito Starace.


Nadal, aiming for a trophy hat-trick at the Real club, has won
the last two editions and is riding a 69-match winning streak on
clay dating back two years.


The double Roland Garros champion won his only other meeting with
the Italian number 72 on clay two years ago.


Ferrer improved to a dominating 5-1 over Nalbandian including 4-0
on clay.


Nalbandian, the 25-year-old former Wimbledon finalist, has
struggled all season to keep his head above water, his record now
standing a dead-level 9-9.


Ferrer improved to 23-9 on the season with a hardcourt title to
hand from Auckland in January. His previous best effort in
Barcelona was the third round at the last two editions.


In other quarter-finals, second-seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko
was playing Guillermo Canas while unknown Spaniard Oscar
Hernandez was aiming to extend his improbable run against Agustin
Calleri of Argentina.
