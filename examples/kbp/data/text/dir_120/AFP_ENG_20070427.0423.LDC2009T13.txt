The chairman of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers,
Jean-Claude Juncker, shrugged off the euro's recent strength on
Friday, saying he was unconcerned as it hit new highs against the
dollar and yen.


"I'm not concerned," said Juncker, who is also Luxembourg's prime
and finance minister.


Earlier the shared European currency hit a historic high of
1.3682 dollars, beating its previous record of 1.3666 dollars
after new data revealed a marked slowdown in US economic growth.


The European single currency also struck another record high
against its Japanese counterpart, rising above 163 yen for the
first time in its history.
