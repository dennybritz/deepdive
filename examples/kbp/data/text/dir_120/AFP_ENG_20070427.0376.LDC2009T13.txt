Norwegian police said Friday they had arrested eight people after
a riot by "anarchists" in the capital Oslo against a meeting of
the NATO military alliance.


The police said they also seized "a number of explosives and
paving stones" in a raid on a home in the city centre where
several "anarchists" live. They did not say what kind of
explosives were found.


Security personnel used teargas Thursday to repel and encircle
around 250 people, some of whom tried to force their way through
protective barriers to reach the site where NATO foreign
ministers were holding informal talks.


The protestors also attacked police vehicles.


The eight who were held are accused of damaging public property
and aggressive behaviour toward police and security officers.
