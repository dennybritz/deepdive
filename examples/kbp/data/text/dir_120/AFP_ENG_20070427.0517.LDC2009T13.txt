A man allegedly held his wife upside down from their balcony as
their four-year- old girl watched after she threatened to leave
him, police said on Friday.


Police said the 44-year-old Italian man grabbed his wife by the
feet and suspended her from their 11th-story balcony in the Swiss
capital following a fight. He has been jailed and charged with
attempted murder.


The man denied the accusations, saying he was trying to stop his
wife from jumping.
