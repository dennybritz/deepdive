Melbourne downed champions Brisbane to remain undefeated in
Australia's National Rugby League with a 28-18 win in a rematch
of last season's grand final here Friday.


Melbourne, who led 16-12 at halftime, raced away to a 28-12 lead
when teenage winger Israel Folau swept over for their fifth try
of the night 15 minutes into the second half.


Eighteen-year-old Folau claimed his ninth try in seven games
diving over out wide to clinch Melbourne's seventh straight win
this season, while the Broncos have only won two of their seven
matches.


The Storm went away with a sense of belated justice after the
2006 decider featured four crucial refereeing decisions that went
the Broncos' way to have a major impact on last year's grand
final.


Meanwhile, Wests Tigers upset competition premiership contenders
Canterbury Bulldogs 34-18 in Sydney.


The Tigers ran in six tries to three for their second straight
win after opening the season with four straight losses, with
young centre Dean Collis the hero scoring two first half tries
and setting up another.


Tigers stand-off Benji Marshall had a personal haul of 14 points
courtesy of a runaway try and five conversions.
