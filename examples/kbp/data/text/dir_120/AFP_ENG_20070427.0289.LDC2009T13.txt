West Ham's Premiership survival hopes were given a massive boost
on Friday when the east London club escaped the deduction of
points for charges relating to the signings of Argentinian duo
Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano.


The club were fined 5.5 million pounds (11 million dollars) for
breaching Premiership regulations governing transfers but can
seek to have that sum reduced on appeal.
