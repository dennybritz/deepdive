A public prosecutor here on Friday demanded four months in jail
for the captain of a French amateur football team who head-butted
a referee during a local league game.


"Violence is never an acceptable way of communication," the
prosecutor said. "It's even less so when it's against a referee
whose job it is to ensure everyone's well-being."


The player, captain of local third division Brittany side
Aucaleuc, was banned for six years after the assault which took
place in January.


The 28-year-old player's club was also docked five points and
ordered to pay a 500-euro fine.


Local president of the national union of football referees, Guy
Granville, said any fears of the case being turned into a media
fest should be put aside.


"We just want this business to serve as an example," he said.
