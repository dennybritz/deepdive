Pakistan Friday welcomed the arrest of a key Al-Qaeda commander
accused of plotting the assassination of President Pervez
Musharraf.


The arrest of Abd al Hadi al-Iraqi, who is in US custody, was a
significant development and would help the ongoing fight against
terrorism, Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao told AFP.


"Pakistan welcomes the arrest," Sherpao said, adding that there
was a five million dollar bounty on al-Iraqi's head.


Al-Iraq, who was taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba within the past
week, was intercepted as he was trying to reach Iraq to manage
Al-Qaeda operations and possibly plot attacks against western
targets outside Iraq, the Pentagon announced Friday.


Spokesman Bryan Whitman described al-Iraqi as "one of Al-Qaeda's
highest ranking and senior operatives" and said he was associated
with leaders of extremist groups allied with Al-Qaeda in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, including the Taliban.


"He also in recent years was involved in plots to assassinate
perceived opponents of Al Qaeda to include Pakistan President
(Pervez) Musharraf as well as other officials," Whitman said.


Musharraf survived two assassination attempts he alleged were
masterminded by Al-Qaeda in December 2003 in the garrison city of
Rawalpindi near Islamabad.


Security officials here have said al-Iraq left Pakistan in late
2004 and moved to Iraq to conduct anti-US operations.


The Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on when and where al-
Iraqi was captured or whether US forces were directly involved in
the capture.
