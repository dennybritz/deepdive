Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was cleared
Friday in a high- profile corruption case involving bribing
judges, the ANSA news agency reported.


A Milan appeals court upheld a ruling in December 2004 in which
Italy's richest man was accused of bribing judges to prevent the
takeover of food company SME by his business rival Carlo de
Benedetti in 1985.


Several other people including judges and Berlusconi's former
lawyer Cesare Previti were convicted in the case.


Prosecutors had sought a five-year prison sentence for
Berlusconi.


Previti, 72, is serving a six-year sentence for corruption under
house arrest instead of in jail because of his age.
