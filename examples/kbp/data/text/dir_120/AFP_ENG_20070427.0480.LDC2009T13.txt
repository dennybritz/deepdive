A US Navy Aegis cruiser simultaneously intercepted a ballistic
missile and a cruise missile in a test over the Pacific, a
Pentagon spokesman said Friday.


"The test demonstrated the USS Lake Erie's ability to engage a
ballistic missile threat and defend itself from attack at the
same time," the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency said on
Thursday.


The Lake Erie is one of a growing fleet of US warships equipped
with advanced radars and high-speed missiles capable of
intercepting short and medium range ballistic missiles.


In the test Thursday near Hawaii, the cruiser used a Standard
Missile-3 Block IA missile to intercept a target missile launched
from the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii.


At the same time, a US Navy aircraft launched a cruise missile to
mimic an attack on the Lake Erie, which engaged it with an SM-2
missile, a spokesman for the agency said.


"It was intercepted at 15,000 feet altitude, 37 miles from the
ship," said Chris Taylor.


Earlier, the Missile Defense Agency described the target in a
press release as having "characteristics similar to a high
performance aircraft."


The ballistic missile target was intercepted 100 miles (160
kilometers)  above the Pacific Ocean and 250 miles (402
kilometers) northwest of Kauai, marking the system's eighth
successful intercept in 10 flight tests, the agency said.
