Werder Bremen's top striker Miroslav Klose on Friday apologised
to his club for holding talks with directors from  Bayern Munich.


"The meeting with Bayern was purely informal and didn't involve
negotiating a contract," the 28-year-old Polish-born marksman -
leading scorer at last year's World Cup finals, said.


Klose's explanation followed talks with Werder's general manager,
Klaus Allofs, who had summoned the player to explain Thursday's
report in Bild which claimed he had met Bayern coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld and general manager Uli Hoeness.


Klose added: "The meeting only lasted 20 minutes, but it was
inappropiate - that's why I've apologised to the directors and
supporters of Werder.


"I should have told the coach and manager about it."


Allofs said Klose's version of events had been accepted.


"But we explained clearly to him that while he's under contract
with Bremen (until June 2008) he cannot join another German
club," warned Allofs.


Before holding clear the air talks with his star asset Allofs had
insisted: "He's going to need to explain this, I want to speak to
the player and his agent urgently.


"I really want to know what happened with Bayern."


Klose, who ended a long goal drought when he scored twice earlier
this month in the second leg of their UEFA Cup quarter-final with
AZ Alkmaar, has indicated his preference would be to move abroad
with AC Milan apparently interested.


According to his club there is a gentleman's agreement in place
that he won't approach any other Bundesliga clubs.
