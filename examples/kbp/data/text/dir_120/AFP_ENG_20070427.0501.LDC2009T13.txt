Crushing debt drove a farmer and his two daughters to commit
suicide in eastern India, just days after New Delhi promised
special insurance to help desperate growers.


The man and his two teenage daughters died after swallowing
poison in an apparent suicide pact late Thursday, the Press Trust
of India reported.


It said the three took their lives after the farmer, blighted by
crop failures, defaulted in repaying 8,000 rupees (177 dollars)
interest on a 2005 bank loan.


The suicide in Orissa came as northern Punjab state on Friday
ordered its first- ever census of debt-related suicides by
farmers in the region, India's food bowl, officials said.


"The problem of rural indebtedness is a cause of great concern as
the incidence of suicides by farmers due to heavy burden of debt
has shown an alarming rise over the past five years," Punjab
Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal said.


Alarmed by the growing number of such suicides, the national
government on April 15 offered a weather-based crop insurance
scheme to farmers in several states including worst-hit
Maharashtra.


Government officials say more than 8,900 farmers have killed
themselves in four cotton-growing Indian states since 2001, a
figure activists say is too low.


Last month, the government said 43 million of India's near 89
million farmer households were in debt.
