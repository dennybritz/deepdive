German prosecutors issued arrest warrants on Friday for two
people wanted over racist attacks on an Indian man and a man of
South American origin who were beaten and kicked.


The two wanted men were part of a four-strong group of neo-Nazi
sympathisers who shortly before the attacks in the eastern town
of Prenzlau had celebrated the birthday of Adolf Hitler on April
20.


One, aged 23, is accused of attempted murder for allegedly
kicking the Indian victim repeatedly while shouting "Foreigner"
and "Turk" at him.


The chief prosecutor of the nearby town of Neuruppin, Gerd
Schnittcher, said the Indian man briefly slipped into
unconsciousness after the beating but declined to be taken to
hospital for treatment.


The other wanted man, aged 25, is accused of causing bodily harm
to the South American victim, who was repeatedly punched.


"There is no doubt that there is an anti-immigrant motive" in the
attacks, the prosecutor said.


The two suspects were briefly held on Thursday but had to be
released without charge because of a lack of evidence at that
point in the investigation.
