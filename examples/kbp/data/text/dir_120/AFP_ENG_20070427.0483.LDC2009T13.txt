The arrest of Al-Qaeda commander Abd al Hadi al-Iraqi, who worked
with Afghanistan's Taliban, is a major success and will be a blow
to terror networks, the Afghan defence ministry said Friday.


"Al-Iraqi was very important for the terrorists' networks. His
arrest is a major success," ministry spokesman Mohammad Zahir
Azimi told AFP.


"It will help to get to the high-ranking terrorist network
figures and it will have deeply negative effect on the network,"
he said.


A Pentagon spokesman said the militant, on a US "most wanted"
list, had been taken into US custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in
the past week.


He declined to comment on when and where al-Iraqi was captured or
whether US forces were directly involved in the capture.


The Al-Qaeda commander has worked directly with the Taliban and
was also involved in plots to assassinate Pakistan President
Pervez Musharraf, the spokesman said.


The militant, said to be close to Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden, is reported to have commanded militant training camps in
Afghanistan.


The US-led coalition, which has led counterterrorism operations
in Afghanistan since overthrowing the Taliban government in 2001
for sheltering Al-Qaeda, confirmed the arrest but referred all
queries to Washington.
