Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya is to visit Switzerland
in May, the first official trip to Europe by the widely boycotted
Islamist premier, a Palestinian source said on Friday.


"Prime minister Ismail Haniya will travel to Switzerland in May,"
a foreign ministry source told AFP, adding that the exact date
had yet to be decided.


"This visit follows an agreement between Palestinian foreign
minister Ziad Abu Amr and the Swiss President Micheline Calmy-
Rey," the source said.
