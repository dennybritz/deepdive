A US soldier was killed Friday in a clash with militants in
western Afghanistan that local officials said also left at least
one Taliban fighter dead.


The soldier "was killed in action when coalition forces made
contact with enemy fighters while conducting a combat patrol" in
Herat province, the US-led coalition said in a statement.


"Coalition forces employed a variety of combined arms to include
close air support to destroy and repel enemy insurgents during
the firefight," the statement said.


A three-hour battle erupted when about 50 Taliban fighters
attacked soldiers in the province's Shindand district, district
governor Khudaidad Arfani said.


He said air strikes killed at least one Taliban.


More than 40 foreign soldiers have been killed in action in
Afghanistan this year, most of them US nationals.


Taliban militants have spread their attacks beyond their
traditional areas of operation in the south and east with western
Afghanistan, on the border with Iran, facing more violence this
year.
