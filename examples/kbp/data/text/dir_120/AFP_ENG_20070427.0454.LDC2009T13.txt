Werder Bremen on Friday called on their top striker Miroslav
Klose to explain reports that he had held talks about a possible
transfer to Bayern Munich.


The club is alarmed at claims in Thursday's edition of Bild that
the 28-year-old Polish-born marksman - leading scorer at last
year's World Cup finals - had met with Bayern coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld and general manager Uli Hoeness.


"He's going to need to explain this, I want to speak to the
player and his agent urgently," Werder's general manager Klaus
Allofs said on Friday.


"I really want to know what happened with Bayern," added Allofs,
who stressed that there was no way Werder would allow Klose to
switch camps to their arch rivals.


Klose, who ended a long goal drought when he scored twice earlier
this month in the second leg of their UEFA Cup quarter-final with
AZ Alkmaar, is under contract at Bremen till 2008, though, the
board has indicated they would let him go.


He has indicated his preference would be to move abroad with AC
Milan apparently interested. According to his club there is a
gentleman's agreement in place that he won't approach any other
Bundesliga clubs.
