More than 170 terror suspects have been rounded up by Saudi
Arabian security forces in their ongoing battle against Al-Qaeda,
an interior ministry spokesman said Friday.


The 172 suspects include both Saudis and foreigners, General
Mansur al-Turki told state television.


Saudi Arabia has been battling Al-Qaeda suspects since they
launched a wave of bombings and shootings, many targeting
Westerners, in the oil-rich kingdom in May 2003.


"Seven cells from the 'deviant group' made up of around 172
Saudis and non- Saudis were arrested. Weapons, money and
documents were also seized," Turki said, using official
terminology for suspected Al-Qaeda militants.


The arrests showed that "the deviant group is linked to foreign
elements and takes advantage of trouble spots outside the kingdom
in planning, recruitment and training," he said in an apparent
reference to war-torn Iraq.


Despite a relentless crackdown by security forces, the militants
are continuing their attempts to "resume their criminal
activities in the kingdom in order to undermine security and
public order and target the country's economy," Turki added.
