Bayern Munich midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger said Friday the
mysterious infection which has sidelined him with right knee
trouble recently was caused by a tick.


Ticks are commonplace in the forests and countryside of southern
Germany, and can transmit diseases to humans - including Lyme's
disease.


A bacterial infection, Lyme's produces symptoms which can include
muscle and joint pains, arthritis, cognitive defects,
neurological complaints or fatigue.


"It turned out to be a tick bite which stopped me from being able
to train. The doctors diagnosed me with having Lyme's disease,"
said the Germany international, whose last match for Bayern was
against AC Milan in the second leg of their Champions League
quarter-final.


Schweinsteiger said a treatment of antibiotics has had the
desired effect and has returned to training although he may take
no further part in the Bundesliga this season.


German champions Bayern are currently nine points behind league
leaders Schalke 04 with four matches remaining.
