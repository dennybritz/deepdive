The Spanish government said Friday it would allow Enel to
exercise its full voting rights in Spanish power firm Endesa, in
which the Italian energy firm has a nearly 25-percent stake.


Under Spanish law the government could freeze Enel's voting
rights at the current three percent because the Italian
government owns 32 percent of the firm and is seeking control of
Endesa.


First deputy prime minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega
said the only condition imposed on Enel would be that it inform
the government of its corporate strategy "regarding aspects that
exclusively affect essential Spanish public security."


Spain's energy watchdog had recommended that the government agree
to Enel's request that its voting rights be raised but retain a
veto over decisions made by the Italian firm regarding Endesa.


Enel and Spanish construction group Acciona have offered 41 euros
a share for Endesa, valuing the company at 43.4 billion euros
(57.6 billion dollars). The two firms already jointly hold 46
percent of Endesa.


The offer follows a failed 40-euro bid by German power company
E.ON for the Spanish power firm.
