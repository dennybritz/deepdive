Dissident Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn on Friday
honoured the memory of legendary cellist Mstislav Rostropovich,
who came to his aid against persecution by Soviet authorities.


"The departure of Mstislav Rostropovich is a bitter blow for our
culture," Solzhenitsyn said in a statement quoted by Russian news
agencies after Rostropovich's death on Friday.


"Goodbye dear friend!" Solzhenitsyn declared.


Rostropovich wrote an open letter to the official newspaper
Pravda in 1970 defending Solzhenitsyn when the author came under
attack by the Soviet propaganda machine for receiving the Nobel
Prize for literature.


Solzhenitsyn had spent spent more than a decade in Soviet prison
camps and wrote about his experiences in harrowing detail in his
most celebrated works: "One Day In The Life of Ivan Denisovich"
and "The Gulag Archipelago."


Rostropovich's letter was never published by the state-controlled
press but it made the musician a marked man, effectively barring
him from the Soviet musical establishment.


Rostropovich fled the Soviet Union with his family in 1974.
