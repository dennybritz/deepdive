Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday that the six-party
talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program
were in a "regrettable" state.


Abe, at a news conference alongside President George W. Bush at
the US leader's retreat here, also lamented North Korea's
attitude regarding the abduction of Japanese citizens by the
Stalinist regime.


"We agree that the current state of the six-party talks, as well
as North Korea's attitude towards the abduction issue are
regrettable and we'll work for closer coordination between our
two countries to achieve progress," Abe said.


Japan, which is one of the six parties in the nuclear talks, has
refused to fund an international deal to supply North Korea with
energy in exchange for its nuclear disarmament unless there is
progress on the abduction issue.
