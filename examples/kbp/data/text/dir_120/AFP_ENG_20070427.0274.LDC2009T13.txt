Socialist candidate Segolene Royal is to meet with defeated
centrist Francois Bayrou on Saturday to try to find common ground
that could help her bid to become France's next president.


Royal said Friday that "the debate will take place as media
organisations have proposed that it take place and it will
therefore be held on Saturday afternoon, in a very simple
manner."


Bayrou came third in the first round of voting on Sunday and his
6.8 million voters could tilt the balance in favour of Royal, who
took the second spot to frontrunner Nicolas Sarkozy.


Royal and Sarkozy are heading into the second and final round of
voting on May 6 with polls showing that the former interior
minister has a slight edge over the Socialist candidate.


Bayrou has refused to endorse either of the candidates but agreed
to hold a debate with Royal on condition that it be open to the
media.


A television station had agreed to broadcast the meeting, only to
withdraw its offer later.


Royal accused Sarkozy of putting pressure on the television
station, saying "it's a problem when a candidate to the
presidency not only refuses to hold debate but also tries to
prevent debates by others."


"These are methods from another age. They say a lot about a
certain amount of conniving with powerful financial media
interests," she said.


"We will nevertheless not be silenced," Royal added.


Royal said that the debate on Saturday could be aired on two
radio stations, Radio Monte Carlo (RMC-Info) and radio Business
FM.
