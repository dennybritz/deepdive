Two spin-offs from the successful movie version of the "X-Men"
comics are being planned, it was reported Friday.


Entertainment industry journal Variety reported that films
featuring the "X-Men" characters played by Sir Ian McKellen and
Hugh Jackman were in pipeline.


"Magneto" will focus on the mutant villain played by McKellen who
has the supernatural power to manipulate metal objects.


McKellen is unlikely to feature prominently in the new film
however as it will tell the story of Magneto's early life as he
struggles to survive a Nazi death camp before hunting down war
criminals in revenge.


However, Australian actor Jackman will reprise his role as the
steel-clawed "Wolverine" in a film of the same name.


The "X-Men" trilogy of films has grossed more than one billion
dollars worldwide.


Several money-spinning comic-book adaptations have hit screens in
recent years, most notably "Spider-Man," which will see a third
instalment go on worldwide release next month.


Marvel Studios recently announced plans to bring cult character
"Iron Man" to cinemas in 2008, which will also see a new movie
version of the "The Incredible Hulk" starring Edward Norton.
