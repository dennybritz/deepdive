Jens Lehmann has ended speculation over his future by signing a
one-year contract extension that will keep him at Arsenal for at
least next season.


The 37-year-old Germany goalkeeper had wanted a longer deal but
Arsenal have a strict policy of only offering one-year deals to
their thirty-something stars.


Lehmann's decision to stay may have been influenced by his lack
of suitable alternatives with the unglamorous Bundesliga outfit
Hertha Berlin the only club to have shown any serious interest.


Lehmann, who will turn 38 in November, had admitted earlier this
week that his main priority was to continue playing Champions
League football, which Arsenal should be able to offer him.


Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has been looking at alternatives to
the German and his scouts have regularly watched Scotland
goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who is expected to leave Hearts this
summer.
