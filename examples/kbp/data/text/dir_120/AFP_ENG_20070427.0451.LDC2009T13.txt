US President George W. Bush said Friday that if Iran continues to
defy the UN Security Council's demand to curtail its nuclear
program, the result will be new sancions and greater isoloation.


Speaking during a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
Bush said the two countries "speak with one voice" to the Tehran
regime.


"Our nations have fully implemented the sanctions imposed by the
UN Security Council in response to Iran's pursuit of nuclear
weapons.


"Further defiance by Iran will only lead to additional sanctions
and to further isolation from the international community," Bush
said.


The US president was referring to two rounds of sanctions voted
by the Security Council against Iran for refusing to halt its
uranium enrichment program.


The US and key western powers believe the program is aimed at
producing nuclear weapons, while Iran insists it has only
peaceful intentions.
