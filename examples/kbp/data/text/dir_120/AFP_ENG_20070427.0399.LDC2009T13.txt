A top Al-Qaeda commander who led operations in Afghanistan and
plotted the assassination of Pakistan's President Pervez
Musharraf has been taken into US custody, a Pentagon spokesman
said Friday.


Abd al Hadi al-Iraqi, who was taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
within the past week, was intercepted as he was trying to reach
Iraq to manage Al-Qaeda operations and possibly plot attacks
against western targets outside Iraq, Pentagon spokesman Bryan
Whitman said.


Whitman said al-Iraqi "was one of Al-Qaeda's highest ranking and
senior operatives at the time of his detention."


He was a key Al-Qaeda commander in the late 1990s and from 2002
to 2004 was in charge of cross border attacks against coalition
forces, working directly with the Taliban, he said.


"He also in recent years was involved in plots to assassinate
perceived opponents of Al Qaeda to include Pakistan President
Musharraf as well as other officials," he said.


Al-Iraqi was held by the CIA before being turned over to US
military authorities, said Whitman.


The Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on when and where al-
Iraqi was captured or whether US forces were directly involved in
the capture.


"At the time of his capture he was trying to return to his native
country, Iraq, to manage Al-Qaeda's affairs and possibly focus on
operations outside Iraqi against western targets," he said.


"He was intercepted before he got there," he said.


Whitman said al-Iraqi also met with Al-Qaeda members in Iran, but
would not say when.
