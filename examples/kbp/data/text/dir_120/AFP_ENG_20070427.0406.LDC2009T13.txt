US President George W. Bush warned Friday that the international
community's patience over North Korea's nuclear promises was "not
unlimited."


Global powers involved in talks to dismantle North Korea's
nuclear program are "patient but our patience is not unlimited,"
he said after a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
