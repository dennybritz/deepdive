Germany coach Joachim Low will meet Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger in
London on Monday for talks about English and international
football, according to the German football federation.


Low will take advantage of a trip to the English capital to meet
national captain Michael Ballack and goalkeeper Jens Lehmann to
"talk to Arsene Wenger about football, notably English football",
the federation said.


Wenger, a German-speaker and knowledgeable about German football,
enjoyed excellent relations with Jurgen Klinsmann, whom Low
succeeded after last summer's World Cup.


Low, who will be accompanied by assistant Hans-Dieter Flick,
goalkeeper coach Andreas Koepke and manager Oliver Bierhof, will
meet Ballack and Lehmann "to discuss preparations for Euro-2008
and their personal cases".
