Turkey's ruling party failed to get its presidential candidate
through a first round of parliamentary voting on Friday after an
opposition boycott robbed it of the required two-thirds majority.


The opposition boycott left the ruling Islamist-rooted Justice
and Development Party (AKP) casting all its 352 votes in favour
of Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, the sole candidate to become
Turkey's next president.


However, despite picking up five additional votes from a handful
of other deputies, it failed to garner the required two-third
majority in the first round of voting in the 550-seat assembly.


A second round, in which the winner still needs a two-thirds
majority, is scheduled for Tuesday.


The AKP however is virtually certain to elect Gul in the third
round on May 9, when an absolute majority of 276 suffices.


It is not certain, however, whether the vote will proceed as
scheduled because the main opposition party, which led the
boycott, plans to ask the Constitutional Court to annul the
first-round vote on a technicality related to quorum rules and
possibly force early general elections.
