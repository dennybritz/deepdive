US President George W. Bush renewed his vow Friday to veto a bill
to withdraw US troops from Iraq and pledged to strike down any
subsequent attempt by the Democratic-led Congress to set a
deadline for a pullout.


"I invite the leaders of the House and Senate, both parties, to
come down soon after my veto so we can discuss a way forward,"
Bush told a news conference after meeting Japanese Prime Minister
Sinzo Abe at his retreat here.


"And if the Congress wants to test my will as to whether or not
I'll accept a timetable for withdrawal, I won't accept one," he
said.
