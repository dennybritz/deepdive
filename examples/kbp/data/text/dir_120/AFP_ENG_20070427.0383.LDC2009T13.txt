Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I think the fact that I have decided to retire is probably one
of the reasons why I'm bowling so well."


- Glenn McGrath on his form at the World Cup where he tops the
wicket-taking charts with 25 victims. The 37-year-old will play
his last match for Australia in Saturday's final against Sri
Lanka.


"It helps all the country rather than anything else. We have all
nationalities in our team and peace as well because we get
together and play. We are going through a bad situation in our
country but this could achieve something different."


- Muttiah Muralitharan hopes a Sri Lanka win might bring a little
joy to his strife-torn country.


"It is about the power of the mind."


- Buddhist monk Delduwe Gnanasumana, Sri Lanka Cricket's regular
spiritual guru who blessed the cricketers before they left for
the World Cup, praying for a Lankan World Cup win.


"We'll seek to reduce this 47-day World Cup by seven or 10 days,
and hopefully we'll get it down to somewhere between five and six
weeks next time."


- ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed admitting that the World Cup
is too long.


"What we want to do is get the best possible coach for the team
and it really doesn't matter to us where that coach comes from."


- West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chief executive Bruce Aanensen
saying the ruling body would have no hesitation in hiring another
foreign coach to succeed Bennett King.
