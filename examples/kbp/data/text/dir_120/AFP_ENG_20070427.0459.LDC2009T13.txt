Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya never doubted he would reach
another World Cup final despite having to wait 11 years for the
privilege.


The 37-year-old all-rounder was part of the 1996 title-winning
team and is one of three survivors, along with Chaminda Vaas and
Muttiah Muralitharan, who will line up against Australia in the
2007 final here on Saturday.


"I always had in my mind that I would get to another World Cup
final," said Jayasuriya.


"We came close in 2003 but lost in the semi-finals to Australia.
We have a good team again this time.


"Winning in 1996 was the best moment of my life. Now I want the
young players in the team to have the same feeling."


Jayasuriya shows no sign of age diminishing his powers.


He is ninth in the list of run-makers at this World Cup hitting
404 runs with two centuries and is looking forward to renewing
hostilities with Australia who Sri Lanka beat in the Lahore final
of 1996 to take the title.


"We are in a very positive frame of mind," said Jayasuriya.


"They are playing very good cricket but so are we. Both sides are
equal."
