Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus on Friday vetoed a law which
would have broadened a ban on former KGB officials holding public
posts, the president's office said.


The legislation, adopted by parliament on April 17, proposed
extending a ban on holding public sector jobs which previously
covered only regular ex-KGB officers to also include former
reservists in the secret police.


Parliament can still override the veto, but only if two-thirds of
the 141 lawmakers vote it down.


The law would ban former reservist members of the Soviet secret
service from holding government and ministerial posts, and from
serving in other public institutions, the army, diplomatic
service and state security department.


It notably would mean that the head of the state security
department, Arvydas Pocius, and lawmaker Antanas Valionis -- a
former foreign minister who has been nominated to serve as
Lithuanian ambassador to Argentina -- could lose their jobs.


A special parliamentary commission last year confirmed that both
Pocius and Valionis were included on a list of KGB reserve
officers.


Pocius handed in his resignation in December 2006, but parliament
rejected it last month.
