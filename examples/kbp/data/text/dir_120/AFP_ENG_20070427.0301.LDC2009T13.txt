The US economy expanded at a worse-than-expected 1.3 percent rate
in the first quarter, marking the slowest period of growth in
four years, the government announced Friday.


Growth in the world's biggest economy weakened notably, amid a
widespread housing slump, following an annualized 2.5-percent
clip in the prior quarter.


The first snapshot of 2007 growth disappointed most Wall Street
analysts who had anticipated growth of at least 1.8 percent.


In the immediate aftermath of the report's release, the euro
leapt to a record high against the dollar, which has weakened
considerably in recent months, striking 1.3682 dollars as fears
mounted about America's economic health.


The bulging US trade deficit with its major trading partners as
well as concerns about a widespread housing market downturn have
conspired to hobble US growth, analysts said.


US exports fell 1.2 percent in the January-March quarter while
imports rose 2.3 percent, contributing to the lower-than-expected
reading for US output.


Housing investment acted as a major drag on growth yet again, as
such investment declined for a sixth straight quarter, slumping
17 percent compared with a year earlier.
