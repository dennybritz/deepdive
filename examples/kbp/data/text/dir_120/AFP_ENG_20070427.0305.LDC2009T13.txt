Southeast Asia's biggest property developer CapitaLand said
Friday net profit in first quarter to March surged nearly five-
fold from last year, boosted by divestment gains and a robust
market.


Net profit rose to a record 608.1 million Singapore dollars (403
million US) from the 129.6 million dollars in the first three
months of 2006, the company said in a statement.


CapitaLand said it booked a gain of 472.9 million from the sale
of Temasek Tower, 41.2 million dollars from the sale of Samsung
Hub and 33.8 million dollars from the placement of the Ascott
Residence Trust units.


Its residential property, commercial and rental businesses helped
drive first quarter earnings higher, including contributions from
the company's investments in China and Australia.


"The upwsing in the Asian real estate market, the ongoing
urbanisation of the Asian economies and the institutionalisation
of Asian real estate are all positive growth drivers for the
entire group," said CapitaLand Group president and chief
executive Liew Mun Leong.
