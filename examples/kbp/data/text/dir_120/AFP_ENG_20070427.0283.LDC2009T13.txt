Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf arrived in Bosnia on Friday
to discuss boosting ties between the two countries, the Bosnian
presidency said.


Musharraf, on his first official trip to the Balkan nation, is to
meet in the capital Sarajevo with members of Bosnia's tripartite
presidency and Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, before addressing
its parliament.


During the two-day visit, Pakistan and Bosnia are to sign several
bilateral agreements, notably on cooperation in air traffic and
the defence industry.


On Saturday, Musharraf is to meet members of a local inter-
religious council that gathers Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox
Christians.


He is expected to support dialogue between the three main ethnic
groups -- Muslims, Croats and Serbs -- who fought each other
during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war.


The Pakistani leader is also scheduled to pay respects to victims
of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.


Some 8,000 unarmed Muslim men and boys were killed in and around
the eastern town by Serb forces at the end of the conflict. The
atrocity is the worst in Europe since World War II.


At the end of his visit, Musharraf is to travel to Turkey where
he is to meet his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai on Sunday and
Monday amid worsening ties between their neighbouring countries.
