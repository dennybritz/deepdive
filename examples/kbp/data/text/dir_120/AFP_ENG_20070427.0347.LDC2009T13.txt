Austria said Friday it will not impose a complete ban on smoking
in restaurants as other european nations have done but instead
will toughen legislation to discourage the habit.


"There will be no total ban on smoking in restaurants," Health
Minister Andrea Kdolsky told a news conference.


Rather, she said, a 2005 law that forbids smoking in public
places -- but which specifically excludes cafes and restaurants
-- would be reinforced from January 1 next year to require larger
restaurants to split their dining areas 50-50 between smoking and
non-smoking sections.


Smaller eateries would have to decide whether they were smoking
or non-smoking establishments and put up a sign declaring their
choice.


The stricter measures came in the wake of a government study
whose results Kdolsky presented on Friday.


It showed that only 58 percent of 1,299 restaurants inspected
across the country were voluntarily prohibiting smoking.


An estimated 14,000 people die of smoking related diseases in
Austria each year.


Other EU nations have legislated to stop smoking in restaurants
and cafes, among them Ireland, Italy, Malta, Scotland, Spain,
Sweden and Wales. England is set to follow in July this year, as
is France from January next year.
