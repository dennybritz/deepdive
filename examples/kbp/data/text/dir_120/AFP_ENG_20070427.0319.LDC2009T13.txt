Turkish Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc gave the go-ahead Friday
for the first round of voting in a crucial presidential election,
in which Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is the sole candidate.


Opposition parties overwhelmingly boycotted the vote, leaving the
Justice and Development Party (AKP) almost on its own in the
550-seat assembly.


Ersonmez Yarbay, an AKP lawmaker who had submitted his candidacy,
withdrew from the election shortly before it began, leaving Gul
as the only candidate.


The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), which led
the boycott, plans to ask the Constitutional Court to annul the
vote on a technicality related to quorum rules and possibly force
early general elections.
