The European single currency hit another record high against its
Japanese counterpart on Friday, striking above 163 yen for the
first time in its history.


The euro hit 163.16 yen in late afternoon trade in London,
following weak Japanese inflation data that raised doubts about
when the Bank of Japan (BoJ) would next raise interest rates,
dealers said.


Earlier Friday, the euro had also jumped to a historic high close
to 1.37 dollars after new data revealed a marked slowdown in
economic growth in the United States.


The new records come as the euro draws strength from favourable
interest rate differentials amid strong growth across the
13-nation eurozone.
