French right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy on Friday attacked as
"absurd" a call by his Socialist rival Segolene Royal for a
boycott of the 2008 Olympics to force China to back international
action in Darfur.


"It is absurd. What do we want, for China to open up or shut
down? The Olympic Games are universal, a wind of freedom and
hope, they will certainly have an extremely positive influence on
China's opening-up," he told reporters.


"To deny the Olympic Games to 1.3 billion Chinese is to isolate
them when what Chinese society needs is to open up. Sport is a
factor for peace, freedom, encounter and dialogue.


"To refuse that is the opposite of what we should do," charged
Sarkozy, who will face off against Royal for the French
presidency on May 6.


Royal argued on Wednesday that the international community should
use "the threat of the Olympic Games" to spur China into
supporting UN action in the war- torn Sudanese region of Darfur.


China responded by saying the threat went "against good will
among the peoples of the world" and calling for "objectivity" and
"calm" from political leaders.


China is Sudan's most important international ally. It buys some
60 percent of Sudan's oil exports and has used its veto to block
resolutions condemning Khartoum in the UN Security Council.
