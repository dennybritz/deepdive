The United States has taken into custody a top al-Qaeda operative
who plotted to assassinate Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf
and other officials, a Pentagon spokesman said Friday.


Abd al Hadi al-Iraqi, who was taken to the US navy prison at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba about a week ago, was intercepted while
trying to reach Iraq to take over Al-Qaeda operations and to plot
attacks from there against western targets outside Iraq, Pentagon
spokesman Bryan Whitman said.


He is "one of Al-Qaeda's highest ranking and senior operatives at
the time of his detention. He is associated with leaders of
extremist groups allied with Al- Qaeda in Afghanistan and
Pakistan, and including the Taliban," Whitman said.
