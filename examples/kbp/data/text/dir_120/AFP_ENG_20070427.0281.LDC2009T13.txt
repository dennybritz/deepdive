More than 170 terror suspects have been rounded up by security
forces in Saudi Arabia, an interior ministry spokesman said
Friday.


The 172 suspects include both Saudis and foreigners, General
Mansur al-Turki told state television.


Saudi Arabia has been battling Al-Qaeda suspects since they
launched a wave of bombings and shootings, many targeting
Westerners, in the oil-rich kingdom in May 2003.
