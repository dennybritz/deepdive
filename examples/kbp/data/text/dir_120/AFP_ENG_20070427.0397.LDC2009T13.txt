An English pub is trying to beat the imminent ban on smoking in
public places by asking for consulate status from the Peruvian
embassy in London, the landlady said Friday.


Debbie Trevithick, from the Peruvian Arms in Penzance, Cornwall,
south-west England, said the pub has close ties with the South
American country and she has written to Peru's ambassador in
London to ask for consulate status.


Lighting up in public places is due to be outlawed in England on
July 1. Scotland and Wales have already done so and smokers will
have to stub out their cigarettes in Northern Ireland on April
30.


"About 95 percent of our customers smoke and it would be
wonderful to be the only pub in England where you could have a
cigarette," Trevithick said.


"Obviously it is a bit of fun so we are not holding out too much
hope. But you never know what might happen."


The pub was built by an 18th century Cornish engineer for his
daughter with money from silver mines in Peru. Trevithick said
the pub has maintained close links with the Peruvian embassy in
London ever since.


She pledged that staff would learn Spanish, celebrate Peru's
national holiday and may even get a pet llama if they secure
consulate status.


Perks of that could include free parking, diplomatic immunity --
and being allowed to smoke on the premises.
