Sobers or Imran. Legendary all-rounders. But who is the greatest
of all time?


Like all questions, it depends on who you ask.


West Indies star Sir Garry Sobers, whose home ground of
Kensington Oval in Barbados is the venue for Saturday's World Cup
final, is tops according to the respected cricinfo website.


"Sir Garry Sobers is not just the greatest allrounder ever, but
the greatest player," said cricinfo editor Sambit Bal.


"He was the most natural cricketer you would ever want to see and
quite simply he could do it all. He is in the top 10 greatest
batsmen of all time, he took over 200 Test wickets and was a
sensational fielder who could field in multiple positions."


However, in a public poll of over 10,000 site users, Pakistan's
1992 World Cup winning captain, Imran Khan, came out on top as
best all-rounder winning 37-percent of the vote.


Top 10 greatest all-rounders (Cricinfo people's poll):


1. Imran Khan 37percent, 2. Sir Garry Sobers 14, 3. Wasim Akram
13, 4. Kapil Dev 11, 5. Ian Botham 7, 6. Jacques Kallis 6, 7. Sir
Learie Constantine 5, 8. Richard Hadlee 3, 9. Adam Gilchrist 2,
10. Shaun Pollock 1.
