Israel has ended extensive military manoeuvres in the occupied
West Bank that were designed to assimilate lessons learned from
last year's war in Lebanon, a senior officer said on Friday.


"For the last 40 hours we have conducted large ground exercises
in the Judean desert," Lieutenant Colonel Elad Ratsabi, the
commander of the elite Shelah unit, told AFP by telephone.


"These exercises were organised to deal with various scenarios
and to take on board lessons learnt after the Second Lebanon
War," he said.


The war games mobilised a brigade, including artillery, armoured
vehicles, infantry and sappers, and followed two and a half
months of intensive training, Ratsabi said. A brigade numbers
about 2,000 soldiers.


A government commission into the conduct and failures of the
Lebanon war between Israel and the Shiite militia Hezbollah is to
publish partial findings on Monday, amid ongoing calls for Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert to resign.


The commission was established on September 17 under pressure
from thousands of army reservists who complained about inadequate
preparation for battle, as well as perceived military and
political mismanagement of the conflict.
