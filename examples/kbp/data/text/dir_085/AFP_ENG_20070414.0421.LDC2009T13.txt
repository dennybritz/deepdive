The prospect of a visit by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II inflamed
nationalist feeling in Canada's French-speaking province of
Quebec, with predictions of protests by critics in the media
Saturday.


"You can be sure that people will demonstrate in protest" if
organizers invite the queen to the province's 400th anniversary
celebrations next year, said Mario Beaulieu of the Quebec
nationalist Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society.


The province was first colonized by France in 1608 but later
conquered by Britain.


"We are celebrating the foundation of New France, not its
conquest," said Beaulieu. "The monarchy remains a symbol of
imperialism and colonialism. Her presence will not be welcomed."


Organizers of the celebrations and the Canadian government have
not yet said whether the British sovereign would be on the
invitation list for the 2008 event.
