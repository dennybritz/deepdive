France's Sebastian Bourdais claimed his 26th career champ-car
pole position here Saturday, leading qualifiers for Sunday's Long
Beach Champ-car Grand Prix.


Three-time defending series points champion Bourdais reached
104.889 mph with a lap in 1:07.546 seconds to set the pace with
Australian Will Power, who won the season opener last week in Las
Vegas, joining him in the front row.


French rookie Simon Pagenaud and Canada's Alex Tagliani qualified
in the second row with US rookie Graham Rahal, the son of former
series star Bobby Rahal, and Dutch rookie Robert Doombos in row
three.


Paul Tracy, who had qualified 11th, will be replaced by Spain's
Oriol Servia after the Canadian veteran suffered serious back
injuries in a Saturday practice crash.


Power leads the points race after the first of 16 races with 34
with Doombos second on 27 and Tracy third on 26. There are eight
rookies among the 17 drivers in the series.
