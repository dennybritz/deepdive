An officer with the African Union peacekeeping force was shot
dead in Al-Fasher in the war-torn Darfur region of Sudan, the
seventh killed this month, a mission spokesman said on Sunday.


"The officer was killed by shots from unknown gunmen near the
entrance to the headquarters of the African force in Al-Fasher
(capital of North Darfur state) and his vehicle was stolen,"
Nourredine Mezni told AFP.


The nationality of the officer was not disclosed.


On Tuesday, a Rwandan peacekeeper was shot dead and two others
wounded, also in North Darfur. Five other members of the
7,000-strong force were killed on April 1.
