An explosion rocked central Kabul on Sunday but it was not
immediately clear what caused the blast, or whether there were
casualties.


It occurred a day after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the
gates of a police headquarters in eastern Afghanistan, killing
seven officers, in another day of bloody unrest in the troubled
country.
