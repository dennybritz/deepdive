Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels shot dead a member of a breakaway
group in eastern Sri Lanka as the country marked the start of the
traditional New Year, the defence ministry said Sunday.


The victim, identified as a member of a Tamil faction known as
the "Karuna Group" believed allied with government forces, was
killed Saturday in the Batticaloa district where five people were
gunned down the same day by suspected rebels, the ministry said.


Tiger rebels denied killing the five people and blamed the
military for the deaths.


The latest killings came as both the majority Sinhalese and the
minority Tamil community marked their common New Year on
Saturday. The rituals connected with the New Year celebrations
continue through Thursday.


More than 4,000 people died between December 2005 and the first
week of March 2007 across the country, including 675 civilians
and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence ministry
figures.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.
