Sri Lanka's national electricity supply was abruptly cut Sunday
with authorities trying to figure out what caused the blackout
that has lasted more than an hour and a half, officials said.


The entire island was without electricity from the national grid,
said a spokesman for the Ceylon Electricity Board, the state-run
body that oversees most electricity generation in the country.


"It is an island-wide power failure," the spokesman said. "We are
trying to restore supplies and we have not been able to identify
what caused the entire system to trip."


There was a similar nationwide blackout in November, shortly
after the finance ministry said the country needed to invest in
more electricity generation and a better distribution network.
