A car bomb ripped through a popular market area in a southern
Baghdad suburb on Sunday, killing five people and wounding
another 20, a security official said.


The car, packed with explosives, blew up in the Al-Shurta al-
Arabaa district, a crowded shopping area, on the first day of the
Iraqi working week.


Initial reports said five people were killed and 20 wounded.


Car bombings and suicide attacks have continued to blight Baghdad
on a near daily basis in the two months since Iraqi and US troops
launched a security crackdown in the capital, with tens of
thousands of soldiers patrolling the streets.
