Austria's Markus Brier blazed a final-round 67 to claim the Volvo
China Open by five shots on Sunday.


The overnight leader shot five birdies against one bogey to
finish on 10-under- par 274, ahead of Northern Ireland's Graeme
McDowell, Australian Scott Hend and Andrew McLardy of South
Africa.


Richard Sterne, also of South Africa, was fifth while two-round
leader Raphael Jacquelin of France finished with a share of sixth
with Australia's Peter O'Malley.


Brier, who also scored 67 on Saturday, claimed his second
European title after last year's Austrian Open.


The two-million-dollar, joint sanctioned tournament was held at
the par-71 Shanghai Silport Golf Club here.
