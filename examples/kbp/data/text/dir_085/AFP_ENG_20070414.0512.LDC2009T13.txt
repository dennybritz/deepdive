All-Star Yao Ming scored 30 points and Tracy McGraded added 11 of
his 25 in the fourth quarter Saturday as Houston defeated the New
Orleans Hornets 123-112 in a National Basketball Association
contest.


The victory kept the Rockets ahead of Utah for home court
advantage in their likely first-round clash in the Western
Conference playoffs. Utah fell 126-98 to Phoenix on Saturday.


The win was also another damaging blow to the playoff hopes of
New Orleans, who trail the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State
for the final playoff spot in the West.


Rafer Alston added 21 points for the Rockets, who avoided a
season-series sweep by the Hornets.


In the fourth quarter, reserve Juwan Howard scored four of his 10
points with back-to-back baskets to help the Rockets push their
lead to 95-82 at the 8:12 mark.


The Hornets dug in, closing within 107-103 when Marc Jackson
found David West, who converted a three-point play with 2:41
remaining.


But McGrady responded with five straight points, highlighted by
his own three- point play, and Shane Battier and Alston drained
consecutive shots from 3-point range with 1:02 left to again
rebuild Houston's lead.
