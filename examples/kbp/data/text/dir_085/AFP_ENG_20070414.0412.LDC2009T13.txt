South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes his team's greater
experience will be crucial when they clash with England in a
make-or-break World Cup clash on Tuesday.


South Africa slumped to a five-wicket defeat at the hands of New
Zealand here on Saturday to leave their hopes of making the semi-
finals hanging by a thread.


But if they win the Super Eight clash in Barbados their last four
place will be assured where they will join defending champions
Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka.


"We will bounce back. We have lots of experience and we are
looking forward to playing England," said Smith. "It's a crunch
game."


South Africa were put into bat on Saturday and struggled to 193-7
with the Black Caps seamers, led by Shane Bond, making the most
of the overcast conditions to put the Proteas immediately on the
back foot.


"The guys are disappointed to lose but I'm not unhappy with the
way we played because the conditions had such a bearing on the
game," added Smith.


"In the first 20 overs it was difficult to get through and hard
to set a big total. We did well to drag it out until the 49th
over when they batted.


"If we had got to 220-230, it would have given us a real chance."
