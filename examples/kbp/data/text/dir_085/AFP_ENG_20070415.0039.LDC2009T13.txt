Four Afghan employees of a US-owned private security firm were
killed in a suicide attack near a base housing thousands of
international troops on Sunday, police said.


The attacker, carrying explosives on a motorbike, targeted a US
Protection and Investigations (USPI) vehicle just a few hundred
yards from Kandahar airfield, a base for the NATO-led
International Security Assistance Force.


"There was a suicide attack against a vehicle of the USPI. Three
guards and a driver were killed and another guard was injured," a
police officer at a nearby checkpost told AFP.


The bombing in this volatile southern city was the second suicide
attack in as many days after eight people, mostly police, were
killed in a blast in the eastern city of Khost.


Nearly a dozen other people were injured in Saturday's blast
which was claimed by the Taliban.


Militants from the Taliban regime toppled by a US-led invasion in
2001 have threatened a wave of suicide bombings this year as the
rebels step up their campaign against the US-backed government of
President Hamid Karzai.


Hundreds of people, most of them civilians, were killed in some
150 such attacks carried out last year.
