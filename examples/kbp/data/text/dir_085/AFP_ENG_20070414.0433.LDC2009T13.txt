British development minister Hilary Benn said Saturday that a pay
scandal engulfing World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz was doing
"damage" to the global lender and should never have occurred.


"While this whole business has damaged the bank and should not
have happened, we should respect the board process," he said in a
statement issued at annual talks of the bank and International
Monetary Fund.


"I am sure these views will be shared by other (World Bank)
governors who will also be considering their response," he said.


The 185-member organization's executive board is deciding how to
proceed after revealing that Wolfowitz personally ordered
startling pay hikes and guaranteed promotions for his bank
employee girlfriend, Shaha Riza.


The World Bank and IMF were due to hold an annual joint meeting
Sunday ostensibly devoted to development policy that risked being
overshadowed by the fate of Wolfowitz.


"This weekend ought to be about the bank's contribution to
fighting poverty and I am looking forward to discussing how we
can increase aid, tackle climate change, and get clean water to
the one billion human beings who don't have any," Benn said.


Commenting earlier Saturday after the IMF's own policymaking
meeting, British finance minister Gordon Brown said Wolfowitz was
playing a "full part" in the weekend talks.


"He has issued his statement of apology. Having published the
facts themselves, the board obviously has to complete its work
and I think we've got to respect the board process," Brown added.
