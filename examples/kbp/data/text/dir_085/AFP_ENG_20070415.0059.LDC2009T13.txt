Afghan forces carried out a controlled explosion of Soviet-era
landmines here on Sunday, a senior police official said.


The blast was "planned by the security forces" and took place
behind a security perimeter, said Ali Shah Paktiawal, chief of
Kabul's police criminal department.


"There were no casualties," he said.


The explosion coincided with a suicide attack in southern
Afghanistan Sunday which killed four Afghan employees of a US-
owned private security firm.


It came a day after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the gates
of a police headquarters in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven
officers.
