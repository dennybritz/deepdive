A 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck large areas in central Japan on
Sunday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or
damage, officials said.


The quake occurred at 0:19 pm (0319 GMT) some 10 kilometres (6
miles) below Mie prefecture, 300 kilometres west of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency said, adding that there was no danger of
tsunami waves.


Late last month, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9
hit the Noto peninsula in central Japan, killing one person and
injuring more than 200 others.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes. A
7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe in January
1995 killed more than 6,400 people.
