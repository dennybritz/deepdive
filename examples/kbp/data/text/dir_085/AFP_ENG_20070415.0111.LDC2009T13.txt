Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president
Mahmud Abbas began their first of planned regular meetings in
Jerusalem on Sunday.


Abbas arrived at Olmert's residence shortly after 1000 GMT and
went straight into the meeting, according to an AFP journalist on
the scene.


The meetings -- agreed during a visit to the region last month by
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- are aimed at
jumpstarting peace talks, which have been largely stalled for six
years.
