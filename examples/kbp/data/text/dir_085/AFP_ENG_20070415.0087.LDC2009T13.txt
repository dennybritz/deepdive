Three vehicle bombings, including a double car bomb attack, tore
through Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 24 people and
wounding dozens, a medic and security officials said.


The coordinated twin car attack ripped through a crowded market
area in southern Baghdad, killing 18 men, women and children, on
the first day of the Iraqi working week, security officials said.


One explosives-packed car blew up outside a restaurant and the
second in a nearby market in the Al-Shurta al-Arabaa district.


"Of those killed 10 are men, five women and three children," a
medic at the Yarmuk Hospital told AFP, adding that 35 wounded
were receiving treatment, several of them also women and
children.


A few hours later, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a minibus
killing six people and wounding 10 in Baghdad's northern Al-
Utaifiyah district, which is predominately Shiite, a security
official said.


The official said the bus was headed towards the Shiite western
district of Kadhimiyah.


Car and suicide bombings have battered Baghdad on a near daily
basis in the two months since Iraqi and US troops launched a
security crackdown in the capital, with tens of thousands of
soldiers patrolling the streets.


Meanwhile, the number of people killed in a suicide car bomb
attack in the central Iraqi shrine city of Karbala on Saturday
has risen to 42, a local health official said.
