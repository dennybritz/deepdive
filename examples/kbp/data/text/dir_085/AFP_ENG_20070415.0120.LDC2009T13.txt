Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Sunday created a new
national security council that includes the radical Hamas
movement for the first time.


The council, aimed at restoring order in the increasingly lawless
territories, will be headed by Abbas with prime minister Ismail
Haniya of Hamas as deputy, a senior Palestinian official told
AFP.


It is the first time that Hamas -- the senior partner in the
national unity government but boycotted by the West -- has a
place in the top Palestinian security body which aims to bring
all security forces under one umbrella.


The council, which will also include the interior, foreign
affairs and justice ministers, will "elaborate political
strategies and security plans," the official said.


Its creation was approved by the government on Saturday as part
of a plan to restore order and unify the diverse security forces
in the territories, which are awash with guns.


The impoverished Gaza Strip is increasingly lawless despite the
formation the unity government last month aimed at ending deadly
infighting between Hamas and Abbas's secular Fatah movement.
