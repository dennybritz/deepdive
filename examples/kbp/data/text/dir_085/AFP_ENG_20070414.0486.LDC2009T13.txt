China Network Communications Group Corp. has opened its first
business base in Japan to allow Internet providers to use its
communications lines linking the two countries, a newspaper said
Sunday.


China's second-largest fixed-line telecommunications carrier also
plans to offer data communications services for Japanese firms
that operate in China, the Nikkei business daily reported.


With the project, China Network Communications has become the
first major Chinese carrier to enter the Japanese
telecommunications market, the newspaper said.


The move is mainly based on expectations that demand for Japan-
China communications lines will grow further ahead of the 2008
Olympics in Beijing, Nikkei said.


As a first step, the Chinese firm has set up a wholly owned
subsidiary in Tokyo with capital of 366 million yen (3.1 million
dollars), it said.


The unit has already applied to the Ministry of Internal Affairs
and Communications for a business licence as a telecom carrier,
it said.


The firm will soon link itself to an undersea cable between the
two countries to start a service to lease the circuit to Japanese
Net access providers.


The Chinese firm is also considering giving Japanese telecom
carriers access to international lines, it said.


The move coincided with last week's visit to Japan by Chinese
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, who agreed with Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe to promote strategically reciprocal relations, particularly
in the information communications sector.
