A library of a Christian association and three Internet cafes
were extensively damaged in pre-dawn bomb attacks on Sunday in
Gaza City, witnesses and security sources said.


No one was wounded in the attacks, they said.


The blast at the library, property of a Baptist church
association, blew off the entry doors and caused extensive damage
inside, a security source said.


"This is a criminal and cowardly act that casts a shadow over the
entire Palestinian people," Rami Ayad, a member of the
association, told AFP. "We will not cave in and will continue our
aim of helping our Palestinian society."


No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing.


Separately, three Internet cafes in Gaza city were also bombed,
the latest of dozens that have been attacked during the past
several months.


Most of the attacks have been claimed by an extremist group
called "The Swords of Truth" that says the cafes offer young
Palestinians access to pornographic Internet sites.
