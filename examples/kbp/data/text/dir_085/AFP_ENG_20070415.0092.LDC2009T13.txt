Heavy fighting erupted between troops from the Somali breakaway
republic of Somaliland and those from the semi-autonomous region
of Puntland, officials said Sunday.


The violence, sparked by a territorial dispute, broke out late
Saturday in Dahar region, about 900 kilometres (560 miles)
northeast of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.


Both sides claimed victory over their rivals but did not give the
death toll.


"Forces from Somaliland attacked our military bases in Dahar and
our forces defeated them," said Abdurahman Mohamed Bangah,
Puntland's information minister.


"They suffered a huge blow and lost in the fighting," Bangah told
reporters in Puntland's capital of Bosaso.


His Somaliland counterpart Ahmed Hassan Dahir also claimed their
forces had inflicted heavy casualties in their rivals.


"Our forces in the outskirts of Dahar have been attacked by
Puntland forces from two directions, but they were totally
defeated and pushed back to the areas they came from," Dahir said
in a statement.


"Somaliland forces are in full control in Dahar district."


The two sides first clashed last weekend over the same matter.


Somaliland, a former British protectorate, unilaterally broke
away from the rest of Somalia in 1991, four months after the
overthrow of former Somali dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.


Puntland declared itself autonomous from the rest of the strife-
torn country in August 1998 under the leaderhip of Abdullahi
Yusuf Ahmed, the current president of Somali interim government.
