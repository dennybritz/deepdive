Riot police beat and detained several Russian opposition members
Sunday at the end of a rally against President Vladimir Putin in
Saint Petersburg.


Police scuffled with protestors as they were herded from the
square where the demonstration took place. Two members of a
radical leftist youth movement were beaten with truncheons and a
woman was left with a bloody nose.


A policeman at the scene told AFP several dozen protestors had
been arrested. Demonstrators chanted "shame!" at police during
the confrontation.


Media reports of violent clashes between youth activists and riot
police at the nearby Vitebsky train station could not be
immediately confirmed.


The violence occurred after up to 2,000 people staged a two-hour
rally against Putin. On Saturday, police violently dispersed a
similar march in Moscow and arrested at least 200 people.
