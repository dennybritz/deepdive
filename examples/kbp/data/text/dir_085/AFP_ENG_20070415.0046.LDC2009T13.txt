About 60 teenage boys have broken out of a juvenile detention
centre in Thailand to join Buddhist New Year festivities, police
said Sunday.


The youngsters at the Ban Metta facility in a Bangkok suburb
escaped Saturday night to join the Songkran festival, which is
celebrated with five days of parties and water fights across the
country.


Police Lieutenant Colonel Veerapong Chaowaphol said 52 of the
boys had been arrested and returned to the facility, while the
rest remained at large.


"They didn't want to break out to escape from their sentences,
but they just were in the mood to celebrate," Veerapong told AFP.


He said that most of the youths were aged about 16 or 17 and were
serving sentences for robbery.


The facility had organised its own Buddhist New Year
celebrations, but Veerapong said the teenagers were probably
tempted to break out by television reports of the nationwide
revelry.


Songkran, which runs from April 13 to April 17, is traditionally
marked by raucous street parties where people throw water to
symbolically cleanse one another at the start of a new year.
