Riot police beat and detained several Russian opposition members
Sunday at the end of a rally against President Vladimir Putin in
Saint Petersburg, an AFP correspondent said.


Police could be seen detaining at least five people and scuffling
with protestors as they were herded from the square where the
demonstration took place.


Police dragged away an elderly man and also beat two members of a
radical leftist youth movement with truncheons. A middle-aged
woman was left with a bloody nose.


The violence occurred at the end of a two-hour rally against
Putin and followed the violent dispersal of a similar rally,
followed by mass arrests, in Moscow on Saturday.
