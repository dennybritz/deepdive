Nephat Kinyanujui left it late to defend his men's title while
Russia's Alevtina Ivanova won the women's race at the Nagano
Olympic memorial marathon on Sunday.


The 29-year-old Kenyan, who set his personal best here last year,
edged past Georgiy Andreyev of Russia in the last 200 metres to
cross the finishing line in two hours 13 minutes and 32 seconds.


Andreyev, among the leaders from the outset, was so close behind
the Kenyan that he clocked the same time. Norio Kamijo was third
in 2:13:37.


Sydney Olympic silver medallist Lidia Simon of Romania led the
four-women group until around halfway, when a one-on-one duel
developed between Ivanova and Dire Tune of Ethiopia.


Ivanova, runner-up in 2003 and fourth in 2004, left Tune behind
from around 35km to clock a personal best of 2:27:49.


Tune was second in 2:28:59 and Lyubov Morgunova of Russia third
in 2:29:34, while Simon finished fourth in 2:34:48.
