A double car bomb attack killed seven people and wounded dozens,
including women and children, outside a restaurant and a popular
market in southern Baghdad suburb on Sunday, a security official
said.


One car, packed with explosives, blew up outside a restaurant and
the second in a nearby market in the Al-Shurta al-Arabaa
district, in what appeared to be a coordinated attack on the
first day of the Iraqi working week.


Seven people were killed and another 40 wounded, a security
official said, adding that women and children were among the dead
and injured.


Car and suicide bombings have continued to blight Baghdad on a
near daily basis in the two months since Iraqi and US troops
launched a security crackdown in the capital, with tens of
thousands of soldiers patrolling the streets.
