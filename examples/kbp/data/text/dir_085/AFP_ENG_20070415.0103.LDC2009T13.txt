England's World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson has announced
that he has retired from all rugby due to a potentially life-
threatening neck injury.


The 28-year-old took a heavy blow during his last club game for
Northampton, a 17-8 European Cup defeat to Biarritz on January
21.


That kept him out of the Six Nations tournament and when he
discovered the extent of the injury he decided to call it a day.


Thompson told the Mail on Sunday he has a disc problem in his
neck which creates a loss of feeling down one arm.


"I went to see a specialist ... and he showed me the results of a
scan," Thompson said.


"My disc was squashing my spine and he told me I was very lucky
to still be walking.


"If I had taken one more knock, I would have ended up paralysed,
or even dead.


"I felt as if I'd emerged from a serious car accident alive,
rather than thinking that something I dearly loved had been taken
away from me."


A second medical opinion confirmed the original prognosis and
Thompson had no hestitation in announcing his retirement.


"I'll miss the game. I'll miss the journeys away with the lads.
And I'll miss the adrenalin, the fear, the togetherness and the
achievement," he said.


Thompson won the Six Nations Grand Slam with England in 2003, the
same year they won the World Cup in England, and also lifted the
2000 European Cup with Northampton. He also played on the 2005
Lions tour to New Zealand.
