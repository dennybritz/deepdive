Suspected Islamic rebels opened fire on a passenger train in
Thailand's restive south, officials said Sunday, injuring three
and forcing the suspension of some rail services in the region.


Railway authorities stopped all services south of Yala town after
gunmen on Saturday attacked a train travelling from near the
Malaysian border to Nakhon Si Thammarat, a city 780 kilometres
(485 miles) south of Bangkok.


Two children were hurt in the ambush in Narathiwat province, one
of three Muslim-majority southern provinces where more than 2,000
people have been killed since a separatist insurgency erupted in
January 2004.


Yala town is in the north of Yala province, meaning all rail
services in the south of Yala and neighbouring Narathiwat have
been suspended.


"We stopped services in the far south for security reasons after
our train was attacked by gunfire," a railway official told AFP.


He said authorities would not resume the service until the
security situation had improved.


Separatist violence has recently escalated in the Thai south,
despite a raft of peace-building measures introduced by the new
government, which was installed after a coup last September.


The region has been on high alert for fresh attacks during the
five-day Buddhist New Year holiday, which ends on Tuesday.
