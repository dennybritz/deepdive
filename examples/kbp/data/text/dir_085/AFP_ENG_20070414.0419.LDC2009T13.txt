Uzbekistan's Ruslan Chagaev ended giant Russian Nikolay Valuev's
unbeaten record with a majority points decision victory here on
Saturday to claim the WBA heavyweight world title.


Valuev had been hoping to one day break Rocky Marciano's record
49-fight unbeaten run in the heavyweight division from the 1950s
and took a record of 46 wins and one no-contest with no defeats
into the bout.


But Chagaev executed his game-plan to perfection and triumphed by
scores of 116-111, 115-113 and 114-114.
