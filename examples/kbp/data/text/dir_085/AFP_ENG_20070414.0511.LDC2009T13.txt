Mexico's Cristian Mijares retained his World Boxing Council super
flyweight title here Saturday with a lopsided decision over
compatriot Jorge Arce.


Mijares won by scores of 119-109, 118-110 and 117-111 to take his
record to 31-3-2, while Arce, a former WBC light flyweight
champion, fell to 46-3-2.


The fight was on the undercard of Filipino star Manny Pacquiao's
non-title bout against unbeaten super-featherweight Jorge Solis.


On the same card, Mexico's Edger Sosa came on strong in the late
rounds to earn a narrow majority decision over American Brian
Viloria for the vacant World Boxing Council light flyweight
crown.


Sosa dominated the final three rounds to capture the victory by
scores of 114-114, 115-113 and 115-113.


Sosa improved to 27-5 with 14 knockouts, while former champion
Viloria fell to 19-2-1.


Viloria lost the title by a unanimous decision to Mexico's Omar
Nino, but Nino tested positive for methamphetamine and was
stripped of the title and suspended by Nevada boxing officials.
