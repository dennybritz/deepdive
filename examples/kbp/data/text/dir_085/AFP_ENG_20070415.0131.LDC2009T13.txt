Bangladesh has suspended night sailings from its main port of
Chittagong after a ship sank in the main channel, hindering
navigation, an official said Sunday.


The 136-foot (45-metre) long ship sank Saturday in the Karnaphuli
Channel leading to the Bay of Bengal after colliding with another
vessel, said senior port official Nazmul Alam.


"We had to suspend night navigation because the sunken ship could
cause more accidents," Alam said, adding that the restrictions
would be lifted after the ship was salvaged.


Chittagong is Bangladesh's biggest port and handles more than 90
percent of an annual 24 billion dollars in overseas trade.


About 1,500 ships call at the Chittagong port annually.
