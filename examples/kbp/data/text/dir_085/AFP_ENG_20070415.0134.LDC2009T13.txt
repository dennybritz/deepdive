Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani urged
Israel to respond to Arab gestures for peace in order to avoid a
"catastrophe," the state news agency QNA reported on Sunday.


"The chance for peace is possible now that Arabs are extending a
hand for it," Sheikh Hamad said, referring to a five-year-old
peace initiative revived at an Arab summit in Riyadh last month.


The initiative calls for peace with Israel in return for its
withdrawal from Arab land occupied in 1967, allowing the creation
of an Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian refugees.


"The Israelis should realise that antagonising the Arabs and
delaying the delivery of their rights is not in their interest,
and that it could bring a catastrophe on to Israel," he said in a
televised debate reported by QNA.


"It is possible that they might face in the future an Arab
generation that rejects peace with them," he added.


Like most Arab countries, Qatar does not have diplomatic
relations with Israel, but the Jewish state has a commercial
interests office manned by two diplomats in Doha.


Representatives of the two countries also meet on a regular
basis.


But Sheikh Hamad downplayed the economic importance of Israel's
commercial office saying that trade between the gas-rich state
and Israel did not exceed 200,000 dollars a year.


Sheikh Hamad, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, was
appointed as prime minister earlier this month.
