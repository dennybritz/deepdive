Mexico's Edger Sosa came on strong in the late rounds to earn a
narrow majority decision over American Brian Viloria Saturday for
the vacant World Boxing Council light flyweight crown.


Sosa dominated the final three rounds to capture the victory by
scores of 114-114, 115-113 and 115-113.


Sosa improved to 27-5 with 14 knockouts, while former champion
Viloria fell to 19-2-1.


Viloria lost the title by a unanimous decision to Mexico's Omar
Nino, but Nino tested positive for methamphetamine and was
stripped of the title and suspended by Nevada boxing officials.


The fight was on the undercard of Filipino star Manny Pacquiao's
non-title bout against unbeaten super-featherweight Jorge Solis.


On the same card, Mexico's Cristian Mijares put his WBC super
flyweight crown on the line against compatriot Jorge Arce.
