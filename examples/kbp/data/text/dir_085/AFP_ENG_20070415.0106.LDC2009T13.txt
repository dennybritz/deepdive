The two helicopters which crashed in Iraq on Sunday were British,
Defence Secretary Des Browne said.


Two troops were killed and one was very seriously injured, Browne
said, adding that the crash appeared to be an accident.


The helicopters came down in the early hours of the morning in a
rural area southwest of Taji, home to a huge American military
base north of Baghdad.


"Now that next of kin have been informed, I can confirm that the
two helicopters reported this morning as having crashed north of
Baghdad earlier today were, in fact, both UK helicopters," Browne
said in a statement.


"Sadly, two personnel have died and one is very seriously
injured. All of these were UK personnel. My thoughts and sympathy
are with them and their families.


"Initial reports indicate that the crash was an accident and was
not a result of an attack by insurgents. An investigation is
underway and I will not comment further on the details of the
incident at this stage."


It was understood that more information would not be released
before Monday.
