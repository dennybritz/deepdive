A 56-year-old South Korean man who had set himself on fire in
protest at free trade with the United States died Sunday, after
two weeks of medical treatment, hospital officials said.


Heo Se-Ok was pronounced dead at Hallym Medical Center Sunday
morning, officials at the hospital said.


Heo, a taxi-driver and anti-FTA (free trade agreement) protester,
doused himself with flammable liquid and set himself ablaze
shouting "Stop FTA!" during a street rally on April 1, a day
before the deal was struck.


Despite receiving intense treatment and surgery since being
rushed to hospital, his condition never improved, according to
local media.


The United States and South Korea, the world's first and 11th
largest economies, reached the FTA deal on April 2, pending
ratification from lawmakers in both countries.


The governments of the two countries say they expect the deal to
boost bilateral trade by eventually removing tariffs on most
goods and services.


Farmers and other workers who fear for their jobs, along with
activists, have strongly opposed the deal since the negotiations
began 10 months ago.
