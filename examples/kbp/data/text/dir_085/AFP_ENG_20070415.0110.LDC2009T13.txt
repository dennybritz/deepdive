Thieves stole jewels worth over one million Swiss francs (823,000
dollars, 608,00 euros) from the Baselworld watch and jewel fair
last Tuesday, shortly before it opened its doors to the public, a
Basel civic official said.


The theft took place whilst the jewels were being delivered, said
Peter Gill, spokesman for the city of Basel's public ministry.


He declined to give any further information as investigations are
still ongoing, except to say that "you have to reckon with events
like this at a fair on such a scale".


The Baselworld trade fair until April 19 brings together 2,109
exhibitors from 45 countries, about two thirds of them from
Europe. Hong Kong has the largest single foreign pavilion at the
event, with 326 companies present.
