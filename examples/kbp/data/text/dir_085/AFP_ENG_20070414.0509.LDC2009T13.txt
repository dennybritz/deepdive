Rescue workers on Sunday searched for survivors after a flash
flood killed at least 35 holidaymakers bathing in two waterfalls
in southern Thailand.


Authorities resumed the hunt at dawn after a torrent of water
poured over the two waterfalls on Saturday afternoon in Trang, a
seaside province 700 kilometres (440 miles) south of Bangkok
growing in popularity with tourists.


"Seven more dead bodies were brought to hospital this morning,
bringing the dead toll up to 35," said Sinchai Rongdej, hospital
director at Yantakhao district where the waterfalls are located.


He said that 15 of the victims were children. Of the 35 victims,
one was a Laos national, while the rest were Thai, Sinchai said.


Police said about 10 holidaymakers remained missing.


About 100 people, who were enjoying the five-day holiday weekend
celebrating Buddhist New Year, were swimming at the Sairung and
Prai Sawan waterfalls, which are about five kilometres apart,
when the flood struck.
