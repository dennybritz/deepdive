Iran on Sunday announced it is launching a tender for offers to
build two new nuclear power stations in the southern city of
Bushehr, a top nuclear agency official said.


"Iran is launching two tenders for the construction of two
nuclear power stations of between 1,000 and 1,600 megawatts
capacity in Bushehr," the director of production of nuclear
energy, Ahmad Fayaz Bakhsh, told reporters.


Bushehr is the location of Iran's first nuclear power plant which
is being built by a Russian contractor. However its completion,
due for this year, has been held up by a string of delays amid
mutual acrimony.
