Indonesia's president on Sunday rejected calls for a cabinet
reshuffle following a string of transport disasters and
corruption claims.


President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said it was "inappropriate"
for political parties to put forwards names and resumes, and send
him text messages on the subject.


"I deem them to be inappropriate as the concept of reshuffle is
not like that. It should be held only if the need arises,"
Yudhoyono said.


"With all due respect, to all sides and political parties ...
they should be aware that maintaining a continuity in the
government in our country is not through such ways," he said,
referring to a reshuffle.


Politicians and analysts have been quoted by the media as calling
for changes, citing the accidents and alleged corruption as well
as the poor health of some ministers.


"We have a five-year work program and we need a continuity from
the cabinet and the government to implement those programs,
therefore a dismantling concept, a massive change, would of
course pose a hindrance," Yudhoyono said.


Yudhoyono came to power as the first directly elected president
in 2004 and his term ends in 2009.


He made a minor reshuffle in December 2005 in which he
transferred three minister to new postings and took on board
three new ministers.


A spate of airliner and ferry disasters in recent months has
claimed hundreds of lives.
