Blind British aviator Miles Hilton-Barber landed his microlight
aircraft here on Sunday to complete another leg of his London-
Sydney charity flight.


With the aid of co-opilot Richard Meredith-Hardy, Hilton-Barber
safely flew his Pegasus Mainair GT 450 in to East Jakarta's Halim
Perdanakusumah at around 2:00 pm (0700 GMT.)


"He came here to raise funds for fighting avoidable blindness,
notably cataracts," said Rastra, who represents the financial
organisation sponsoring the flight and uses only one name.


Hilton-Barber, who has been blind for 25 years, is travelling
13,500 miles (22,000 kilometres) across 19 countries with the aim
of raising one million dollars to fund cataract surgery in
developing countries.


"There are so many blind people who have no opportunity to
undergo the operation," said Rastra, who like many Indonesians
only uses one name.


Hilton-Barber plans to land in five Indonesian cities, including
Jakarta, en route to Darwin in northern Australia.
