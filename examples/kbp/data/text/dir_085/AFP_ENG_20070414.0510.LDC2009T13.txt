Two home-made bombs exploded a few kilometres apart in
Indonesia's restive Poso in Central Sulawesi, but caused no
casualties, police said Sunday.


The first blast hit the Mapane area of Poso at 7:45 pm (1145GMT)
while the second hit a few minutes later in Kasiguncu, some two
kilometres away, said First Inspector Rumapar of the Poso
district police.


"There was no one injured and no damage," Rumapar said adding
that both blasts took place in the open, on the side of roads.


He declined to give further details but said that police were
still combing both sites to search for clues.


South Sulawesi Police Chief Badrodin Haiti was quoted by the
Antara news agency as saying that the explosives were home-made
bombs using PVC casing and containing metal shards. Both bombs
were also similar and were believed to come from a single source.


Unrest in Poso town and the surrounding district of the same
name, pitting Muslims and Christians, flared during 2000 and
2001, leading to about 1,000 deaths. Intermittent violence and
tension have continued since.


Poso last came into international spotlight in 2005 when Islamic
militants beheaded three teenage Christian schoolgirls, a crime
that drew wide condemnation.
