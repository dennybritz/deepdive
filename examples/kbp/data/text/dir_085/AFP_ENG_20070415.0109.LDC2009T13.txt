An elderly Buddhist man was shot dead and his body set on fire
Sunday in Thailand's restive south, police said, days after a
similar incident provoked angry protests.


The 70-year-old man was attacked by suspected Islamic militants
as he drove his motorbike home from a market in Narathiwat, one
of three Muslim-majority southern provinces beset by a separatist
insurgency.


The attackers shot the man three times in the head and torso,
before setting his body on fire. Passers-by were able to rescue
the corpse before it was badly burned, a local police officer
said.


A 26-year-old Buddhist woman was shot and burned beyond
recognition in Yala province on Wednesday while Thailand's junta
leader was in the region.


About 200 angry villagers paraded her remains through the streets
of Yala town to demand that General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who is
also the army chief, put an end to the unrelenting bloodshed
here.


After Sonthi seized power in a coup in September, he installed a
government that promptly unveiled a raft of peace measures for
the region, only to see the violence worsen.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in the provinces of Yala,
Narathiwat and Pattani since the latest separatist insurgency
broke out in January 2004.
