Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Sunday that Israel was ready
to hold talks with Arab nations on their recently revived plan
for comprehensive Middle East peace.


"We are ready to hold talks with any combination of Arab states
on their ideas and I would be glad to hear their ideas on the
Saudi initiative," Olmert said at the start of the weekly cabinet
meeting in Jerusalem.


"I hope there will be a chance for such meetings," he said.
