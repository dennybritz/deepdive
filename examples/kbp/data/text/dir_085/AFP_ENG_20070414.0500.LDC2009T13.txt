Argentinian qualifier Mariano Zabaleta upset second-seeded
American James Blake 7-5, 7-6 (9/7) Saturday to reach the final
of the US Men's Clay Court Championships.


Zabaleta, in search of his fourth career title, will face
unseeded Croatian Ivo Karlovic, who fired 15 aces en route to a
7-6 (7/5), 6-2 victory over Albert Montanes of Spain.


Zabaleta, ranked 156th in the world, arrived in Houston with a
1-3 match record for the season. He broke Blake in the 11th game
of the first opening set and served it out.


Blake earned his first service break of the match in the eighth
game of the second set, but immediately dropped his own serve as
the set went to the tiebreaker.


Blake had three set points in the decider before Zabaleta stormed
back, giving himself the chance at his first title since he won
his second straight Bastad title in 2004. His other title came in
Bogota in 1998.


Karlovic will be appearing in his third career ATP final on as
many surfaces and trying to capture his first ATP title.


Karlovic saved the only three break points he faced in the fifth
game of the opening set and broke Montanes in the fifth and
seventh games in the second set, closing the match with four
consecutive aces.


The towering Croatian has served 43 aces this week for a total of
306 this year.


Zabaleta will try to become the fourth Argentinian this year to
capture an ATP title, Guillermo Canas, Juan Monaco and Juan
Ignacio Chela.
