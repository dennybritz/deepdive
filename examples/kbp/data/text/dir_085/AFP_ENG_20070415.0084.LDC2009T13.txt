First results from Nigeria's elections to choose state governors
and legislators will be announced around midday (1100 GMT)
Sunday, an national electoral commission official said.


"The late commencement of voting in many polling centres led to
the delay in the release of results," the official, Philip
Umeadi, told reporters.


"We are now in the process of collating the results, and when we
reconvene at about noon today we will tell you the available
results," he added.


Saturday's polls were seen as a test for the presidential
elections in a week's time to replace President Olusegun
Obasanjo, who is ending his second four-year term.


They were held with security forces on high alert across the
country's 36 states.


Voting got off to a late start in many parts of the country, with
European Union observers reporting a string of "worrisome"
incidents. They included violence, under-age voting, a shortage
of electoral material and other logistical problems.


A total of 61.5 million people out of a total population of 140
million are entitled to vote.


The presidential elections on April 21 will be a historic first
for Nigeria, the country's first civilian-to-civilian handover of
power since independence from Britain in 1960.
