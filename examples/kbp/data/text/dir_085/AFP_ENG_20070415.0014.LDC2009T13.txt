The US military has determined that more than 40 Afghan civilians
were killed or wounded by US marines after a suicide bombing in a
village near Jalalabad last month, The Washington Post reported
Sunday.


Citing the US commander who ordered the probe, the newspaper said
there was no evidence that the marine special operations platoon
came under small-arms fire after the bombing, although the
marines reported taking enemy fire and seeing people with
weapons.


The troops continued shooting at perceived threats as they
traveled miles from the site of the March 4 attack, said Major
General Frank Kearney, head of Special Operations Command
Central, according to the report.


They hit several vehicles, killing at least 10 people and
wounding 33, among them children and elderly villagers, The Post
said.


"We found ... no brass that we can confirm that small-arms fire
came at them," Kearney is quoted by the paper as saying. "We have
testimony from marines that is in conflict with unanimous
testimony from civilians at the sites."


The results of the preliminary investigation are similar to the
findings of an official Afghan human rights inquiry and
contradict initial reports that the civilians might have been
killed in a small-arms attack that followed the suicide bombing,
The Post said.
