The number of people killed in a suicide car bomb attack in the
central Iraqi shrine city of Karbala has risent to 42, a local
health official said on Sunday.


"Forty-two people were killed in the blast, including eight
children," said Salim Kadhim, spokesman for Karbala health
department.


Kadhim said Saturday's bombing also left 224 people wounded,
including 138 men and 86 women. The wounded men included five
Iranian pilgrims.


The bomber exploded his car near a shopping area close to the
revered Shiite shrine of Imam Hussein in the city.


Initial death tolls fluctuated widely, with security officials
reporting 47 dead, later revised to 34 by the city governor Akhil

Police also imposed a vehicle curfew in the city, which is a
magnet for hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims across the
world who visit the revered Imam Hussein shrine.
