Filipino superstar Manny Pacquiao warmed up for his upcoming
election fight by stopping previously undefeated Jorge Solis in
the eighth round of their scheduled 12-round super featherweight
bout.


Pacquiao, Ring magazine's 2006 fighter of the year, was
galvanized by an accidental head butt that left him cut over the
left eye in the sixth round.


He stepped up his aggressive attack in the seventh and sent his
Mexican opponent down at 1:16 in the eighth, when referee Vic
Drakulich counted Solis out.


Pacquiao improved to 43-3-1, with 35 wins inside the distance,
while Solis fell to 32-1-2.


With the victory out of the way, Pacquiao can again turn his
attention to May 14 elections in the Philippines, where he is
standing as a congressional candidate.


Last month, the General Santos City native's lawyer, Franklin
Gacal, submitted Pacquiao's certificate of candidacy to run in
South Cotabato.
