League leaders Stade Francais all but assured their place in the
Top 14 semi- finals after a 21-16 victory over Albi on Saturday.


Stade, who have led the table all season, can even secure a last
four spot next weekend, as long as other results go their way.


Meanwhile, bottom placed Montpellier's relegation woes worsened
as they were beaten 25-9 by Brive.


It is still tight at the bottom, though, with seven teams
separated by just five points.


Perpignan moved into third in the table with a 29-12 victory over
Montauban, while fifth-placed Biarritz beat Agen 17-7 on Friday.


Stade will secure their semi-finals spot if they beat Montauban
next weekend and Biarritz fall to Perpignan.


Bourgoin moved up to sixth with a 32-19 win over Castres and
Bayonne triumphed 16-8 against Narbonne.
