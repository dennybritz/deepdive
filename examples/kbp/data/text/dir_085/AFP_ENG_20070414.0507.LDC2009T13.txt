Japan urged North Korea on Sunday to fulfil its pledge to start
shutting down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor in line with an aid-
for-disarmament deal, despite missing its first key deadline.


"Although the deadline has passed, it is still extremely
important for North Korea to take initial action as soon as
possible," said Noriyuki Shikata, a Japanese foreign ministry
spokesman.


Saturday was the deadline for North Korea to start shutting the
reactor and admitting UN atomic inspectors back under the
disarmament deal it reached with five world powers on February
13.


"It is also important for North Korea to come back to the six-
nation talks as soon as possible," Shikata said.


"By coordinating with countries concerned, we will continue to
urge North Korea to fulfill what they have agreed upon."


Progress on the agreement has been held up by Pyongyang's refusal
to begin closing the facility before it has confirmed the release
of 25 million dollars of North Korean funds frozen in a Macau
bank by US sanctions.


Japan has tense relations with North Korea and has taken the
hardest line in the six-nation disarmament talks, largely because
of a domestically sensitive dispute over Pyongyang's past
kidnappings of Japanese civilians.


Tokyo has refused to provide funding for the February 13 deal,
under which North Korea would close Yongbyon in return for badly
needed fuel aid.
