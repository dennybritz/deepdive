A double car bombing tore through a crowded market area in
southern Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 18 men, women and
children, medics and security officials said.


One explosives-packed car blew up outside a restaurant and the
second in a nearby market in the Al-Shurta al-Arabaa district, in
what appeared to be a coordinated attack on the first day of the
Iraqi working week.


"Of those killed 10 are men, five women and three children," a
medic at the Yarmuk Hospital in the Iraqi capital told AFP,
adding that 35 wounded were receiving treatment, several of them
also women and children.


Car and suicide bombings have battered Baghdad on a near daily
basis in the two months since Iraqi and US troops launched a
security crackdown in the capital, with tens of thousands of
soldiers patrolling the streets.


Meanwhile, the number of people killed in a suicide car bomb
attack in the central Iraqi shrine city of Karbala on Saturday
has risen to 42, a local health official said.
