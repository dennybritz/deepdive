Jerry Kelly aced the par-3 fourth hole on his way to a four-under
par 67 here Saturday to grab the lead at the US PGA Verizon
Heritage after a tough day for Ernie Els.


Kelly, who trailed leader Els by three strokes when the day
began, stood on 13-under par 200 after 54 holes at the 5.4
million-dollar event with fellow American Kevin Na and South
African star Els one stroke back.


Els fired a par 71 in a roller-coaster round that opened with a
double bogey but saw him fight back with birdies at three, eight
and 10. Els followed a bogey at the 11th with a birdie at 13.


Els clung to the lead but bogeys at 16 and 17 dropped him back
and it took a 15-foot birdie putt at the last hole just to move
level with Na, who shot a 66.


Kelly birdied the second hole and took a bogey at the third
before a hole-in-one sparked his spirits. Kelly followed with
birdies at the fifth, seventh, ninth and 12th holes before giving
back strokes at the 13th and 15th.


American Boo Weekley was fourth on 202 with Masters champion Zach
Johnson, fellow Americans Sean O'Hair and Vaughn Taylor, Canadian
Stephen Ames and Australian Stephen Leaney sharing fifth on 204.
