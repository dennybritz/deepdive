Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Sunday pledged that Israel would
work to make sure that Holocaust survivors end their days
decently, amid reports that tens of thousands live below the
poverty line.


"Our duty is to allow those who lived through these events to end
their lives decently in Israel," Olmert said during the weekly
cabinet meeting ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorations
in Israel.


Israeli media reported on Sunday that some 80,000 survivors of
the Nazi genocide in Israel, out of some 250,000 overall, live
below the poverty line, which is defined as around 400 dollars of
monthly income.


Later Sunday, Olmert was to attend the annual ceremony in the Yad
Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem that marks the start of
the remembrance day.


Some six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War
II.
