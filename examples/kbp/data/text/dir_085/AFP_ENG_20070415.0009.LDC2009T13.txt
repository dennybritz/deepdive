An Australian teenager was lucky to be alive on Sunday after she
survived being mauled by a massive sea lion while surfing.


Ella Murphy was attacked by the creature, thought to weigh about
300 kilograms (660 pounds), as she stood on a surfboard being
towed behind a boat on Saturday.


The animal was close to charging the 13-year-old girl a second
time as she floundered in the water off the coast of the small
town of Lancelin in Western Australia when she was rescued by the
driver of the boat, Chris Thomas.


"You can only describe it as like a white pointer (shark) jumping
out of the water," he told News Limited newspapers.


"It was really sort of movie-like. This thing just exploded in a
full-on, frontal attack.


"It actually lined her up. It jumped out of the water at her and
hit her head- on. It must have been travelling at an enormous
speed.


"It opened its mouth and grabbed her head. It latched on."


Thomas manoeuvred his boat between the sea lion and the girl to
prevent a second mauling.


"It was going back for her, it was looking for her and it spotted
her," he said. "I had this horrible feeling I was not going to
make it back in time."


Ella, who suffered a broken jaw and lost three teeth in the
attack, was in a stable condition at Princess Margaret Hospital
late Saturday.


Her mother, Michelle Forbes, said her daughter had a gash under
her chin which was "quite close to her carotid artery."


"We could have lost her," she said.


Sea lions are a protected species and it is thought that
environmental officers will attempt to move it into another area
rather than kill it.
