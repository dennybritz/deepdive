Israel is ready for preliminary contacts with the Arab League
leading to negotiations on the Saudi peace initiative, Israeli
government number two Shimon Peres said Sunday.


"For the moment there is no channel of discussions between Israel
and the Arab League, and the coming period must be limited to
preliminary contacts," Peres told Israeli public radio.


"All the parties are seeking channels that would enable the
opening of discussions on the disputed points," he added when
asked whether negotiations could be started on a permanent
settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
