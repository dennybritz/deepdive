Malaysia is to take a tough stance against smoking after data
revealed that the percentage of women smokers has doubled in
recent years, a report said Sunday.


Health Ministry parliamentary secretary Lee Kah Choon said eight
percent of the estimated six million smokers in Malaysia were
women, which adds up to 480,000, the Star daily reported.


"This may not seem much, but several years ago women only made up
of four percent of the nation's smokers," Lee said.


He said the government was now formulating a Tobacco Products Act
that will force cigarette companies to print large images of
damaged lungs on packets.


Under the new act, cigarette factories and manufacturers will be
forced to register with the health ministry so it can monitor tar
and nicotine levels to ensure products meet government standards.


He said the health ministry will also keep controlling the market
to discourage smoking by raising the price on cigarettes.


"The price of a pack of 20 sticks of cigarettes is now 7.40
ringgit (2.15 dollars) compared with 7.0 ringgit (a year ago),"
Lee said, according to the newspaper.


Taxes on cigarettes and tobacco, which doubles the cost price,
are raised annually in Malaysia.


"According to a World Bank report several years ago, raising the
price of cigarettes by 10 percent would bring about a reduction
of 4-8 percent in sales," Lee said.


Malaysia earlier this month threatened to control the price of
cigarettes to stop multinational tobacco sellers from lowering
them to encourage sales.
