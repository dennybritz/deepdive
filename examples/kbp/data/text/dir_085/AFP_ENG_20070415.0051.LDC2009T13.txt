Two US helicopters crashed after an apparent mid-air collision
just north of the Iraqi capital on Sunday, killing two soldiers
and wounding five more, the military said.


"An investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the
incident; however, initial reports indicate it appears to be from
mid-air collision and not the result of enemy fire," a statement
said.


The helicopters came down in the early hours of the morning in a
rural area southwest of Taji, home to a huge American military
base north of Baghdad in an area where US aircraft have often
come under fire from insurgents.


Twelve US choppers, including two operated by a private security
firm, have come down in Iraq since January 20, most of them as a
result of enemy fire.
