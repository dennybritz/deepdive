Mexico's Cristian Mijares retained his World Boxing Council super
flyweight title here Saturday with a lopsided decision over
compatriot Jorge Arce.


Mijares won by scores of 119-109, 118-110 and 117-111 to take his
record to 31-3-2, while Arce, a former WBC light flyweight
champion, fell to 46-3-2.


"I fought the fight of my life," said Mijares, who defended the
title he captured on September 18. "I beat a great champion. I
beat a warrior."


The fight was on the undercard of Manny Pacquiao's super
featherweight bout against Mexico's Jorge Solis, in which the
Filipino superstar stopped the previously unbeaten Solis in the
eighth round.


On the same card, Mexico's Edger Sosa came on strong in the late
rounds to earn a narrow majority decision over American Brian
Viloria for the vacant World Boxing Council light flyweight
crown.


Sosa dominated the final three rounds to capture the victory by
scores of 114-114, 115-113 and 115-113.


"I did enough to win, but he stepped it up in the championship
rounds, and that was the difference in the fight," Viloria
admitted.


Sosa improved to 27-5 with 14 knockouts, while former champion
Viloria fell to 19-2-1.


Viloria lost the title by a unanimous decision to Mexico's Omar
Nino, but Nino tested positive for methamphetamine and was
stripped of the title and suspended by Nevada boxing officials.
