US telecom group AT&T has pulled out of talks to buy a
controlling stake in Italian operator Telecom Italia, news
reports said on Monday.


AT&T and its Mexican affiliate America Movil have been in
exclusive takeover talks since the beginning of the month to buy
a majority stake in Italian holding company Olimpia, which owns a
controlling 18-percent stake in Telecom Italia.


Italian news agency ANSA reported the failure of talks on Monday,
citing company sources in Italy, shortly after a similar report
from The Wall Street Journal newspaper.


The exclusivity of the talks was set to finish at the end of the
month.


The Italian press had reported last week that French group France
Telecom and Spain's Telefonica were also interested in buying the
stake in Telecom Italia, the formerly state-run telecoms group.


The sale of the Telecom Italia stake has stoked nationalist
concerns in Italy about the prospect of the giant company falling
into foreign hands.


Italian tyre group Pirelli, which holds 80 percent of Olimpia, is
divesting its shareholding in the group.


Even though the Olimpia stake in Telecom Italia amounts to just
18 percent, Olimpia nominates most of Telecom Italia's directors.
