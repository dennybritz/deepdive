German and UEFA Cup title challengers Werder Bremen could be
without influential midfielder Tim Borowski for the rest of the
season, the player said Monday.


The German international suffered a knee injury during Sunday's
crucial 2-0 victory at Borussia Dortmund and will be out for an
indefinite period of time.


With just a month remaining this season, Borowski could miss the
title run-in and Bremen's UEFA Cup quest.
