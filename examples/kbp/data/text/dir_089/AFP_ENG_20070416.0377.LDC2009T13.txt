An Israeli citizen suspected of being involved in the theft of 21
million euros (28 million dollars) from a bank in Antwerp has
been arrested in Germany, prosecutors in the city said Monday.


The man, 47-year-old Eliser Mishali, was arrested on April 4 in
Frankfurt and Belgian authorities have requested his extradition,
prosecutors said, according to the Belga news agency.


The man was arrested with help from information provided by US
authorities, Belga said.


Belgian authorities are still looking for the loot and the main
suspect, 55 -year-old Yehuda Mishali, who is suspected to have
carried out the theft on March 5 ahead of a long weekend.


The heist was carefully planned with the thief preparing the
ground by visiting the bank, an agency of Dutch group ABN Amro,
every day for a year.


He rented a safety deposit box under the false name of Carlos
Flomenbaum, an Argentinian whose passport had been stolen in
Israel, and was able to win over the confidence of the head of
the safety deposit room, according to the local prosecutor's
office.


Antwerp, dubbed "the world's diamond capital", is the leading
trading centre for rough diamonds with about 70 percent of the
global production passing through the 1,500 specialized firms in
the neighbourhood around the city's train station.
