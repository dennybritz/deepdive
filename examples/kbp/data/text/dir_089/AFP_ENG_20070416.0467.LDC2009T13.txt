The Netherlands has denied a visa to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail
Haniyeh, who had been invited to the country by a pro-Palestinian
Dutch organisation, the foreign ministry said Monday.


"The minister (Maxime) Verhagen is opposed to a demand for a visa
for Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh," a statement said.


"Minister Verhagen wants to stop Haniyeh from coming to the
Netherlands," it said, adding that Haniyeh's Hamas party was "on
the European Union's list of terrorist organisations".


The statement said the prime minister had not approached Dutch
authorities for a visa himself but had been invited to speak in
May by an organisation called the Palestinian Platform for Human
Rights and Solidarity.
