Australia's Andrew Symonds admitted he was stunned to see Sri
Lanka rest frontline bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah
Muralitharan from their World Cup Super Eights clash on Monday.


Symonds smashed an unbeaten 63 as the world champions wrapped up
a comfortable seven-wicket win at the Grenada National Stadium.


Both sides had already made sure of their places in the semi-
finals but Monday's result made it almost certain that Sri Lanka
will avoid the defending champions in the last four and will
probably face New Zealand in Jamaica.


Australia, as probable Super Eights winners, look destined to
play their semi- final in St Lucia against either South Africa or
England although West Indies still have an outside chance of
getting through.


"It's not the way we would have done it but they're a different
team," said Symonds on the decision to rest Vaas and
Muralitharan.


"They are key players. It can affect confidence when you do
that."


Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene defended the decision to
rest the duo which immediately weakened an attack already without
injured seamer Lasith Malinga.


"We have to do what's best for the team and that's why we took
the decision," said Jayawardene.


"We use our personnel on and off and we have to make sure we have
the guys ready for the semi-finals."
