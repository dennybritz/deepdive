Britain's governing Labour Party has dropped to its lowest level
in the polls since Prime Minister Tony Blair became its leader 13
years ago, according to a survey published on Tuesday.


The Populus poll for The Times showed support for Labour at 29
percent, down one percentage point from a similar survey a month
ago. The main opposition Conservatives also dropped one point to
37 percent.


Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats, Britain's third-biggest party,
rose two points to 20 percent, and various smaller parties made
up the remaining 14 percent.


Publication of the survey comes a day after Defence Secretary Des
Browne apologised to parliament for his handling of the aftermath
of the release of 15 sailors captured by Iran last month.


Browne had initially presided over a decision to allow the group
to sell their stories to the media, and two eventually did, but
was harshly criticised by the families of soldiers in Afghanistan
and Iraq, opposition politicians, and military personnel.


According to the Populus survey, though 73 percent of respondents
believed that the eight sailors and seven marines should not have
been allowed to sell their stories, only 30 percent thought
Browne should lose his job for the decision.


The poll also comes with less than three weeks to go before
elections in various local councils across England, as well as
the Scottish and Welsh regional assemblies, where Labour is
expected to have a poor showing.


Populus questioned 1,503 adults by telephone between April 13 and
15.
