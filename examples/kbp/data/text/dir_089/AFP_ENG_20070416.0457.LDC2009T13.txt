US President George W. Bush was "horrified" by the school
shootings that left at least 22 people dead at a Virginia
university Monday, the White House said.


"He was horrified, and his immediate reaction was one of deep
concern for the families of the victims, the victims themselves,
the students, the professors and all of the people of Virginia
who have dealt with this shocking incident," said spokeswoman
Dana Perino.


The White House was monitoring the situation in what was already
one of the deadliest school massacres in US history, and federal
government assets were on stand-by in case the state of Virginia
asks for help, she said.


It was not yet clear whether or when Bush would travel to
Virginia Tech, said Perino, who described school shootings as
tragedies that "collectively break America's heart."


But the spokeswoman did not indicate that the president backed
any new restrictions on firearms as a result of the massacre.


"As far as policy, the president believes that there is a right
for people to bear arms, but that all laws must be followed," she
said.
