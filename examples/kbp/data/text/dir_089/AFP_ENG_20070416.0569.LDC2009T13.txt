A television journalist working for a channel owned by former
Democratic Republic of Congo vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba has
been released on bail after his arrest for inciting violence, a
local media watchdog said Monday.


Papy Tembe Moroni, who works for the private Canal Congo
Television (CCTV), was arrested in Kinshasa on December 1 last
year and released on Friday, the Journalists in Danger non-
governmental organisation said in a statement.


Moroni had been accused of "instigating hatred and violence" and
spreading "misinformation."


DR Congo authorities forcibly closed two television stations and
a radio channel owned by Bemba on March 21, the eve of two days
of bloody clashes between his bodyguards and the military which
claimed at least 200 lives.


Bemba, who lost to President Joseph Kabila in the last
presidential elections, then sought refuge at the South African
embassy and has since flown out to Portugal, ostensibly for
medical treatment.
