At least 40 civilians were killed and 25 wounded in an April 11
attack believed to have be carried out by the Janjaweed militia
in the war-torn Darfur region, the UN mission in Sudan reported
Monday.


"A group of armed men, allegedly Janjaweed militia, attacked
Abujogh Market (north Darfur) and seven other villages," the
mission said in its daily report.


"The attackers reportedly used 30 vehicles equipped with heavy
machine guns and artillery. Reportedly, 40 civilians were killed
and 25 others were wounded," it added.


US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, who spent five days
in Sudan, said Monday as he was leaving that the Sudanese
government must rein in the Janjaweed militia, which has been
used by the government to quell the rebellion that erupted in the
western Darfur region in 2003.


"The government of Sudan must disarm the Janjaweed, the Arab
militias that we all know could not exist without the Sudanese
government's active support," he said.


The UN also reported clashes between the Gimir and Boroug tribes
on April 14 over livestock, which resulted in 24 dead and several
wounded.


The vast, arid Darfur region has been the regular scene of
clashes between rebel splinter groups, government-backed militias
and rival tribes for four years with the UN estimating some
200,000 dead and another two million displaced.
