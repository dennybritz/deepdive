Australia were 59-0 after 10 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against Sri Lanka at the Grenada National Stadium
here on Monday chasing 227 to win.


Adam Gilchrist was on 27 and Matthew Hayden was on 26.


Earlier Brad Hogg took two key wickets as the world champions
dismissed Sri Lanka for 226.


Sri Lanka, after collapsing to 27 for three, saw captain Mahela
Jayawardene (72) and Chamara Silva (64) put on 120 for the fourth
wicket before both batsmen fell in quick succession to left-arm
wrist spinner Hogg.


The former postman finished with two wickets for 35 runs from his
10 overs while left-arm quick Nathan Bracken did a superb job at
both ends of the innings in a miserly return of four for 19 from
9.4 overs.


Sri Lanka decided to rest star bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah
Muralitharan for the game.


Both Australia and Sri Lanka, as well as New Zealand, have
already qualified for the semi-finals.
