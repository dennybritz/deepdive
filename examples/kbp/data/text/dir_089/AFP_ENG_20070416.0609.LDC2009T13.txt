A ship flying the flag of St Vincent and the Grenadines with 17
Russian crew members aboard went aground Tuesday near Honshu
island off Japan, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.


The Jane, carrying 6,000 tonnes of coal from Sakhalin in Russia's
far east to Japan, "ran aground for as yet unknown reasons" said
an official with the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk maritime rescue centre
quoted by Interfax.


He said no one had been injured. All the crew members remained on
board, and the Japanese coastguard had launched a rescue
operation.
