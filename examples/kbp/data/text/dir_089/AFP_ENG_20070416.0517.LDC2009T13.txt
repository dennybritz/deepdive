French presidential candidates Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal
are neck-and- neck in second-round voting intentions for the
first time in a poll published Monday.


Socialist candidate Royal and right-wing favourite Sarkozy each
got 50 percent support, according to a poll conducted by CSA-
Cisco for Le Parisien, Aujourd'hui en France and I Tele.


The poll asked who people would support if Sarkozy and Royal won
through to the second and final round of the election by
finishing in the first two places in Sunday's first round.
