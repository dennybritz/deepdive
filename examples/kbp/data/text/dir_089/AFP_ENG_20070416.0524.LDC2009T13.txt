US President George W. Bush said Monday that the United States
was "shocked and saddened" by the shooting rampage that left at
least 32 dead and many more wounded at a university in Virginia.


"Schools should be places of safety, and sanctuary, and learning.
When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every
American classroom and every American community," he said in a
brief statement at the White House.
