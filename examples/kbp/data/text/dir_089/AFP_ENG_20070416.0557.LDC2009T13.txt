A US court on Monday sentenced a New York storekeeper to 13 years
in jail for conspiring to provide funds for Islamic militants
fighting in Afghanistan and Chechnya, justice officials said.


Abdelrahman Farhane, 52, pleaded guilty in November to charges of
conspiracy to launder money for militants to allow them to
purchase weapons and equipment.


According to prosecutors, Farhane met an unidentified FBI
informant in his retail store in 2001 in which the two discussed
sending money overseas so that fighters could obtain wireless
communications equipment and advanced weaponry.


During one of the meetings, Farhane indicated that he would ask
some "brothers" for help in determining the best way to send
money to the fighters, prosecutors said.


In his guilty plea, Farhane said he agreed to "transfer money to
mujahedeen in Afghanistan and Chechnya," the war-torn southern
Russian province.


Justice officials did not disclose Farhane's nationality.
