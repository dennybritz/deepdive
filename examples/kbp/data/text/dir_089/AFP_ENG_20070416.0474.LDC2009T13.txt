McClatchy Company on Monday joined a consortium of US newspaper
groups merging local news and advertising with Yahoo's global
Internet search engine.


McClatchy is the twelfth publishing company to join the
consortium since it was formed in November of 2006 and raises the
number of newspapers in the alliance to 264.


The list of companies in the group already includes Hearst
Newspapers, Cox Newspapers, MediaNews Group and Belo Corporation.


Under the deals, publishers can use Yahoo's search technology ad-
targeting platform on their websites and the Sunnyvale,
California-based online search titan can post stories from the
newspapers on its websites.


Ad sales teams at Yahoo and the newspapers can also peddle each
others' offerings to advertisers.


"The consortium also demonstrates that our members recognize this
plan delivers significant benefits to our advertisers and
readers," said McClatchy chief executive Gary Pruitt.


"We expect other newspaper companies will be joining in the near
future."
