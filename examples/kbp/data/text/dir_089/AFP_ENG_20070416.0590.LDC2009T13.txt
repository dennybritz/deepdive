Colombia's smaller rebel army is willing to enter into a cease-
fire as it talks peace with the government, National Liberation
Army negotiator Pablo Beltran announced Monday.


"We are not talking about the disappearance of the ELN, but about
an experiment, a temporary cease-fire, to create an atmosphere of
peace and of participation, and if that works, then we can extend
the peace, but if it does not work, it will not be extended," he
said.


Beltran said the Colombian government had been apprised of the
offer from the National Liberation Army, a Marxist, pro-Castro
group.


The ELN and Colombian negotiators have agreed to hold peace talks
in Havana to demobilize its 4,500 irregulars.


Colombia's larger rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), has 14,000 rebels in arms.


"When we get to talks about how to implement the cease-fire, we
will have to invent a formula that demonstrates compliance, while
not jeopardizing the continuity of ELN projects," he said.
