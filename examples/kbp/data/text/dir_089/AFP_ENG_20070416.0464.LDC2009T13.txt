Troubled French toy maker Smoby-Majorette, under bankruptcy
protection since March 19, said Monday it had agreed to be taken
over by US-based rival MGA Entertainment.


Smoby-Majorette, which describes itself as Europe's second-
biggest toy maker, said the deal would see the founding Breuil
family sell their stake in the group and foresaw a month during
which MGA would finalise the terms of its takeover.


Over the next month, MGA would supply "the financial means via a
banking intermediary to finance the working capital requirements
of the companies of the group placed under a judicial safeguard
procedure."


The group has been under a judicial safeguard procedure since
last month, a French form of bankruptcy protection.


MGA has faced competition from two other companies interested in
buying Smoby, including Chinese manufacturer Cornerstone and a
group of creditors, led by Deutsche Bank.


The group, the biggest French manufactuer of toys, was founded in
1924 and employs 2,750 people worldwide.
