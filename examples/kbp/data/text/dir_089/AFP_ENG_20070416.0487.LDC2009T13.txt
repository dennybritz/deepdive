Morocco accused Algeria on Monday of trying to wreck its proposal
to give autonomy to the disputed Western Sahara territory by
encouraging the separatist Polisario Front there to present its
own plans.


Speaking less than a week after the plan was presented to the UN,
Foreign Minister Mohamed Banaissa told a parliamentary committee
that Algeria was attacking it "based on erroneous and unfounded
grounds".


He said Algiers was "encouraging the Polisario Front to deceive
the international community by tabling an initiative that has no
other aim but to block our own constructive proposal".


On Wednesday, the day Rabat presented the proposal to the UN, the
Polisario Front submitted its own plan advocating independence in
the Western Sahara and "good neighbourly relations with the
Kingdom of Morocco".


Banaissa said the Moroccan proposal was a "an open proposition
aimed at reaching a consensual and realistic settlement that
could be enriched by suggestions from other parties during
negotiations".


The Algerian-backed Polisario Front fought Morocco for
independence in the Western Sahara from when the territory was
annexed by Rabat in the 1970s until a UN-brokered ceasefire in
1991.
