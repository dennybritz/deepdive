The Berlin zoo on Monday said Knut, the cuddly polar bear cub
that has become a media superstar, had fallen ill and was being
treated with antibiotics.


The four-month-old bear's first public appearance of the day was
cut short because he was not feeling well, said the zoo's bear
curator Heiner Kloes.


Kloes said the ailment was not serious, adding that Knut had
taken a nap after the drugs were administered.


Knut was elevated to stardom after an animal activist said he
should be put down after his mother rejected him at birth.


Although the activist later claimed he had been misquoted, Knut's
cause was taken up by the German media and within days the
photogenic cub was splashed across the front pages of newspapers
across the world.


His handler Thomas Doerflein has recounted how he carefully
removed the newborn from his aggressive mother's cage and bottle-
fed him round the clock like a baby.


The zoo recently began separating Knut from Doerflein but said it
was doing so gently to avoid any trauma. The cub however also has
to cope with unseasonably hot spring weather.


Hundreds of animal lovers queue at the zoo daily to see Knut, who
is brought into the open twice a day to allow the public to watch
him splash in a pond, jump on rocks and play with Doerflein.


He has been photographed for an environmental awareness campaign
by US glamour photographer Annie Leibovitz.


The zoo has trade-marked Knut's name for use on t-shirts,
posters, postcards and toy bears and recently reported an
increase in its share price, largely thanks to its latest
attraction.
