Virginia Tech University student Erin Sheehan recalled Monday how
she played dead to save herself as a gunman burst into her German
class and methodically mowed her classmates down.


Sheehan, sporting glasses and a shaved head, spoke calmly as she
recounted to CNN her brush with the killer responsible for the
deadliest school shooting spree in US history that left a total
of 33 people dead.


"He was, I would say, about a little bit under six feet tall,
young looking, Asian, dressed sort of strangely, almost like a
boy scout, very short-sleeved light, tan shirt and some sort of
ammo vest with black over it," Sheehan said.


She said he was carrying what appeared to be a black handgun and
peeked in twice to the class before later coming back with
murderous intent.


"He just stepped within five feet (1.5 meters) of the door and
started firing," said Sheehan, a freshman and mechanical
engineering major.


"He seemed very thorough about it, getting almost everyone down.
I was trying to act dead," she said.


"He left for about 30 seconds, came back in, did almost exactly
the same thing. I guess he heard us still talking.


"And then we forced ourselves against the door so he couldn't
come in again, the door would not lock. And so he came and tried
to force himself in another three times and started shooting
through the door."


Sheehan said the class had 25 people in it plus the professor.
"When we left, only four of us left," she said. "Everyone was
else was unconscious, either dead or wounded seriously."
