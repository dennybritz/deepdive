Ukrainian heavyweight Wladimir Klitschko will defend his
International Boxing federation crown on July 7 in Cologne,
Germany, against American Lamon Brewster, promoters said Monday.


Brewster stopped Klitschko in the fifth round in 2004 and the
European, whose record is 48-3 with 43 knockouts, wants to avenge
the defeat.


"The chance for revenge against Lamon Brewster is a dream come
true," Klitschko said. "He is without a doubt an extremely
dangerous opponent, but I always hoped for a chance to redeem
myself."


Klitschko won the IBF crown a year ago by stopping US fighter
Chris Byrd in the seventh round and has twice defended the title,
most recently by beating Ray Austin last month.


Brewster, 33-3 with 29 knockouts, last fought a year ago and lost
in a 12-round decision to Sergei Liakovich.


"I will knock out Klitschko again and no one will be able to say
the first one was a fluke," Brewster said.
