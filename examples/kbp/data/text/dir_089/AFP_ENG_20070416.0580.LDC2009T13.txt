Queen Elizabeth II was "shocked" and "saddened" after hearing
that 33 people were killed in a shooting rampage on a US
university campus on Monday.


The shooting, in a hall of residence and a classroom at Virginia
Tech University, was the deadliest ever on an American college
campus.


"The Queen was shocked and saddened to hear of the news of the
shooting in Virginia," a spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said.


"She will be kept informed."


Along with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, she is set to pay
a two-day visit to Virginia on May 3 and 4 to commemorate the
400th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement, her first visit to
the United States in 16 years.
