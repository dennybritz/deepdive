From the country that gave you Riverdance, Ireland can now boast
The Chicken and The Ferret.


The Irish team's World Cup campaign, which has accounted for
Pakistan and Bangladesh, has also spawned a couple of new moves
which would definitely look out of place at all self-respecting
nightclubs.


Captain Trent Johnston celebrates the fall of a wicket with a
bizarre jig which involves leaping from one foot to the other
while flapping his arms.


"The chicken dance came out of when I am out on the dancefloor,
the guys say I look like a chicken so that's just a celebratory
dance I've given to the guys," said Johnston.


"And we also have Dave Langford-Smith who does the ferret as
well. It's just a bit of fun. We are out here having fun and
enjoying ourselves."


Langford-Smith, who, like Johnston is an Australian native,
pioneered the ferret at his wedding reception.


He performed it at a party in Jamaica to celebrate the win over
Pakistan last month.


It came out again in the win over Bangladesh.


The ferret looks a bit like the chicken except the arms do their
flapping behind the back not at the sides.
