Two men died of sunstroke in northern India on Monday as an early
summer heat wave intensified across the region, officials said.


The two men collapsed in the northern city of Bhatinda, where
temperatures soared to nearly 41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees
Fahrenheit), they said.


The 15 million residents of the capital New Delhi sweltered in
40-degree temperatures, city officials said, with meteorologists
predicting that the mercury could rise by another four degrees in
the coming days.


Prolonged power cuts compounded the misery, officials said.


In the northern desert state of Rajasthan, temperatures in
Sriganganagar reached 44.5 degrees Celsius, the weather office
said.
