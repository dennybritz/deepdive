British singer Bryan Ferry apologised "unreservedly" Monday for
comments in which he described elements of the Nazi regime in
Germany as "just amazing".


Ferry, frontman of 1970s band Roxy Music, reportedly praised the
style of Adolf Hitler's far-right regime in the 1930s and 1940s
in an interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.


"The Nazis knew how to put themselves in the limelight and
present themselves," he was quoted as saying.


"Leni Riefenstahl's movies and Albert Speer's buildings and the
mass parades and the flags -- just amazing. Really beautiful."


Ferry added that he calls his studio in London the
"Fuhrerbunker", a name for the underground rooms in Berlin where
Adolf Hitler killed himself in 1945.


His statement later stressed that he was only praising the Nazis'
aesthetics, not the regime itself.


"I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused by my comments
on Nazi iconography, which were made solely from an art history
perspective," he said.


"I, like every right-minded individual, find the Nazi regime, and
all it stood for, evil and abhorrent."


Former lawmaker Lord Greville Janner, ex-president of the Board
of Deputies of British Jews, said he was pleased Ferry had
apologised, adding: "I trust that he will never make the same
mistake again."


Ferry is known for his sharp dress sense and hits such as
"Virginia Plain" and "Love Is The Drug".
