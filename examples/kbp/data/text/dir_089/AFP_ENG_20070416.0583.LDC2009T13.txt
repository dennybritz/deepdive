A near-defunct leftist Basque party, which has taken steps to
field canditates in next month's local elections in Spain, said
Monday it had no plans to replace the banned Basque separatist
party Batasuna in the polls.


"Our objective never was, nor is it now, to replace or represent
another party in the elections," the Eusko Abertzale Ekintza-
Basque Nationalist Action (EAE- ANV) party said in a statement.


Last week the party put forward representatives to the body which
oversees the registration of electoral lists for the for the May
27 elections in the northern Basque and Navarre regions, a
preliminary stage in putting up candidates.


The Spanish government suspects the move is part of an attempt by
Batasuna to circumvent its ban and take part in the elections but
the party said it had acted to keep its options open in case it
decides to run in the election.


Batasuna was banned under a 2003 law which required all political
parties to denounce violence. It has refused to break definitely
with ETA, whose armed 38-year campaign for Basque independence
has claimed over 800 lives.


The EAE-ANV party was founded in 1930 as a result of a split with
the moderate Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), which governs the
Basque country's regional assembly.


But its political activities have been virtually non-existent for
several years. Unlike Batasuna it faces no restriction to its
participation in the upcoming vote.
