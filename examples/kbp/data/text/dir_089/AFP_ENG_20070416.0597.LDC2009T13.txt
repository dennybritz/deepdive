Boston rookie center Phil Kessel, who overcame a bout of
testicular cancer in December, was among 18 players named Monday
to the US team for the World Ice Hockey Championships.


Carolina Hurricanes left wing Erik Cole and his teammate on the
reigning National Hockey League champions, goaltender John
Grahame, were also on the US roster for the Moscow tournament,
which runs from April 27 through May 13.


Rosters for the 16-team event do not include talent from teams
that are still playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs, but as clubs
are eliminated, the squads can bolster lineups for the global
tournament won in 2006 by Sweden.


Cole scored 29 goals and added 32 assists in 71 games for the
Hurricanes this season, but Carolina failed to qualify for the
playoffs.


Philadelphia goaltender Robert Esche, St. Louis right wing Lee
Stempniak, Boston defenseman Andrew Alberts, Phoenix defenseman
Keith Ballard and Washington right wing Chris Clark were also
among those on the American roster.


"We've got a good mix of players with world championship
experience and younger players who will likely be a part of our
program for years to come," said Jim Johannson, senior director
of hockey operations for USA Hockey.


Mike Sullivan, an assistant coach on last year's US Olympic team,
will guide the US squad, which opens against Austria on April 27.
