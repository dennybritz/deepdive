Robert Cheruiyot won the 111th Boston Marathon men's crown here
on Monday, leading a Kenyan podium sweep with his third triumph
in the race and second in a row.


Cheruiyot, who also won here in 2003, battled bitter cold, high
winds and heavy rain to win in an unofficial time in 2 hrs, 14
mins 12 secs - the slowest men's winning time since 1977.


James Kwambai finished second with Stephen Kiagoro third but it
was Cheruiyot, the 15th Kenyan to win in the past 17 races, who
triumphed overcoming a conservative early pace because of the
weather conditions.


"The race was too slow. We were very cautious not to go too
fast," Cheruiyot said. "I was very confident. I was very strong.
I had trained enough. I didn't fear anybody."
