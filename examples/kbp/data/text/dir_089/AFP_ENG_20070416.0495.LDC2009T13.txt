French President Jacques Chirac on Monday expressed his "horror"
and his "total solidarity" with the United States following the
university shooting there that killed at least 22 people.


"The President of the Republic learned with horror and
consternation of the shooting at the University of Virginia," a
statement from his office said.


Chirac "offered President George W. Bush, the families of the
victims and the American people his most sorrowful condolences
and his total solidarity, both personally and in the name of the
French people", it said.


At least 22 people were killed on the campus of Virginia Tech
University on Monday by what is believed to have been a lone
gunman. It was the bloodiest school shooting in US history.
