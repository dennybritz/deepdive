Italy coach Pierre Berbizier is to leave his post after the World
Cup later this year the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) announced
on Monday.


The 48-year-old Frenchman's time in charge has seen a marked
improvement by the Italians - they won two matches in the Six
Nations for the first time this season including their first ever
away match - but his contract finishes at the end of the World
Cup in October.


"Pierre Berbizier out of a personal choice said he wanted to
return to France at the end of his contract," a spokesperson for
FIR said while adding they would like to thank him for what he
had already achieved.


Berbizier, who took on the job in April 2005 after John Kirwan
was sacked, made his name as a coach when he was in charge of the
French national side, guiding them to the 1995 World Cup semi
finals where they lost controversially to hosts South Africa.


The decision by Berbizier, who was capped 56 times by France and
captained them 11 times, could mean he fancies his chances at
replacing Bernard Laporte as France coach.


Laporte is stepping down after the World Cup which runs from
September 7 to October 20.


Italy are in Group C in the World Cup along with favourites New
Zealand, Scotland - who the Italians beat in the Six Nations -
Namibia, Romania and debutants Portugal.
