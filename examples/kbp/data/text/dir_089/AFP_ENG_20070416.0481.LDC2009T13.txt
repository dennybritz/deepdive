US telecom group AT&T said Monday it had ended talks on a
potential takeover of Telecom Italia, which had sparked a
shareholder battle and set off concerns in the Italian
government.


In a brief statement, AT&T said simply that "it has ended
negotiations to potentially acquire a one-third stake in Olimpia
SpA, a holding company with approximately 18 percent of Telecom
Italia's ordinary shares."


The statement did not elaborate on the reasons for ending the
discussions.


"The company said it appreciated the opportunity to explore a
possible investment in Olimpia and a strategic partnership with
Telecom Italia, but has decided not to pursue the matter
further," AT&T said.


The talks, which gained wide news coverage in Italy, sparked
fierce opposition from small shareholders


The move also set alarm bells ringing in the Italian government
which fears the loss of an industrial icon.


A raucous general assembly meeting was attended Monday by several
hundred shareholders in the northern town of Rozzano, near Milan.


The talks involved tire group Pirelli, owner of 80 percent of the
Olimpia holding company, which has the largest stake in Telecom
Italia.


Even though that stake amounts to just 18 percent, Olimpia
nominates most of Telecom Italia's directors.


Pirelli had been in exclusive negotiations until the end of the
month with AT&T and the US firm's Mexican affiliate America
Movil to sell two-thirds of its stake.
