Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz arrived in China late
Monday for an official visit during which the close allies are
due to sign a raft of bilateral agreements, state media said.


During his stay in Beijing, Aziz is scheduled to meet with
Chinese President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, Xinhua
news agency reported.


He is also set to travel to the southwestern city of Chengdu for
the opening of a new Pakistani consulate.


In an interview with Xinhua ahead of his arrival, Aziz said the
two sides would sign more than 20 agreements and memorandums of
understanding covering technology, education, banking,
infrastructure and investment.


The Pakistani prime minister qualified bilateral ties as "deeper
than the deepest ocean, higher than the highest mountain," the
state news agency said.


Last November, Hu became the first Chinese leader to visit
Pakistan in a decade. During his trip, the two countries signed a
free trade deal and agreed to boost their strategic partnership
in the defence and energy sectors.


China is Pakistan's largest arms supplier and the two are jointly
developing the JF-17 Thunder fighter jet. Beijing is also
providing major industrial and economic assistance to Islamabad.


Islamabad meanwhile is helping Beijing deal with the perceived
threat of Muslim separatists in China's western Xinjiang region,
which borders Kazakhstan and Pakistan.
