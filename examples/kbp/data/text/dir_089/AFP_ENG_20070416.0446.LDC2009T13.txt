Insurgents killed two more US soldiers and wounded another two in
Baghdad on Monday, the military reported.


One soldier was killed and one wounded when their vehicle was
struck by a roadside bomb in a southern area of the capital.


Another soldier was killed and one wounded when their combat
patrol came under small arms fire attack in a southwestern area
of Baghdad, a separate statement from the military said.


The latest fatalities brought the military's losses in Iraq to 45
in April alone and to 3,299 since the March 2003 invasion,
according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
