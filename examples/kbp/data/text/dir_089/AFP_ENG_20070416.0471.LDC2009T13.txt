The United States on Monday urged Nigeria to fix any voting
problems before its weekend presidential contest and take steps
to quell election-related violence.


"In Nigeria, the United States takes seriously reports of voting
irregularities and election-related violence during this past
weekend's state and local elections," said White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino.


"We would urge that officials address any problems in order to
ensure that Saturday's presidential election, that those polls
are free and fair and conducted in an atmosphere free of
violence," she said.


"These elections set the stage for an important milestone, as
they will lead to the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of
power in Nigeria's history at the end of May," Perino told
reporters.


The elections on April 21 will decide the presidency as well as
the composition of the Nigeria's national assembly.
