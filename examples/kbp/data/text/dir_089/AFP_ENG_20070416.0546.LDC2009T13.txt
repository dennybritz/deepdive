Brazil's former swimming dual world record holder Maria Lenk has
died aged 92 of a heart attack it was announced by the Brazilian
Olympic Committee (COB) on Monday.


The COB added that there would be three days of mourning for
Lenk, who was known as 'The Lady of the swimming pool'.


Lenk, who had been taken to hospital suffering from breathing
difficulties, appeared in the 1932 Olympics aged 17 but her
career reached its peak when she broke both the 200metres and
400m breast stroke world records in 1939.
