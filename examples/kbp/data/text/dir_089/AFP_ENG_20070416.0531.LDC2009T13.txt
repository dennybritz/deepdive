Australia were 217-3 after 40 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against Sri Lanka at the Grenada National Stadium
here on Monday chasing 227 to win.


Skipper Ricky Ponting was on 58 and Andrew Symonds on 56.


Australia got off to a flying start in their reply with Adam
Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden putting on 76 for the first wicket
before Hayden was out in the 12th over.


He was caught by Tillakaratne Dilshan off spinner Russel Arnold
for 41 off 30 balls. Arnold then had Gilchrist lbw for 30 in the
14th over when the total was on 79.


Michael Clarke then helped put on 47 for the third wicket before
he was caught by Dilshan off leg-spinner Malinga Bandara, playing
his first match at the World Cup, for 23.


That made the total 126-3 in the 24th over.


Earlier Brad Hogg took two key wickets as the world champions
dismissed Sri Lanka for 226.


Sri Lanka, after collapsing to 27 for three, saw captain Mahela
Jayawardene (72) and Chamara Silva (64) put on 120 for the fourth
wicket before both batsmen fell in quick succession to left-arm
wrist spinner Hogg.


The former postman finished with two wickets for 35 runs from his
10 overs while left-arm quick Nathan Bracken did a superb job at
both ends of the innings in a miserly return of four for 19 from
9.4 overs.


Sri Lanka decided to rest star bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah
Muralitharan for the game.


Both Australia and Sri Lanka, as well as New Zealand, have
already qualified for the semi-finals.
