The White House on Monday said it was "deeply disturbed" by the
repression of Russian opposition demonstrations over the weekend
by the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin.


"In Russia, we are deeply disturbed by the heavy-handed manner in
which this weekend's demonstrations in Moscow and Saint
Petersburg were broken up by the authorities, and by an emerging
pattern of use of excessive force by the authorities in reaction
to similar events," said spokeswoman Dana Perino.
