More than 1,000 foreign observers will monitor presidential
elections in the west African nation of Mali due later this
month, the head of the national poll commission told AFP Monday.


"More than 1,000 foreign observers have asked to be allowed to
monitor the presidential election of April 29," Fodie Toure said.


"Requests for accreditation have come from all over: mainly from
Africa and Europe."


Eight candidates, including one woman and the current head of
state Amadou Toumani Toure, are contesting the polls.


The landlocked former French colony, which has a population of
11.7 million, was governed by military dictatorship for more than
20 years until the early 1990s.
