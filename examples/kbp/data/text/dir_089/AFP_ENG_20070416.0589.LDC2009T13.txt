US Attonery General Alberto Gonzales won a two-day reprieve
Monday as US lawmakers put off his testimony in a scandal over
purged prosecutors as the nation mourned a campus massacre.


"We ... all understand it is appropriate to postpone attorney
general Gonzales' appearance before the committee until Thursday
in light of the tragic events," committee chairman Senator
Patrick Leahy said.


The US was left reeling Monday after 33 people, including a
gunman, died in in shootings at Virginia Tech University, in the
bloodiest school shooting in the nation's history.


The beleaguered Gonzales had been due to to testify Tuesday about
his role in a raging scandal over the sacking of eight federal
prosecutors, amid allegations the firings were a political purge
by the White House.


The embattled top US prosecutor, who was to appear at a hearing
of a congressional committee reviewing his possible role in the
firings, has said he has "nothing to hide" in the probe.
