Edward Norton is to play the lead role in the latest attempt to
bring the adventures of comic-book hero the Incredible Hulk to
the big screen, Hollywood industry reports said Monday.


Norton will play scientist Bruce Banner who transforms into the
superhuman green giant in a film that is to begin shooting later
this year, the reports said.


News of the latest Hulk film comes four years after the 2003
movie starring Eric Bana and directed by Oscar-winning Taiwanese
film-maker Ang Lee.


Although that film opened well in the US, it failed to match the
success of other cinematic adaptations of Marvel comic book heros
such as "Spider-Man," "X-Men" and the more recent "Ghost Rider."


Reports said the new film would be less serious than Ang Lee's
take, and would focus on Banner's search for a cure to the
condition that turns him into the Hulk.


"Edward Norton is a rare talent and one of the most versatile
actors in the business," Marvel Studios production president
Kevin Feige said in a statement. "His ability to transform into a
particular role makes him the ideal choice to take on the
character of Bruce Banner and the Hulk.


"Edward is perfectly suited to bring one of the most popular and
important Marvel icons to the big screen in a new and exciting
way."


The film marks a change of tack for Norton, who has recently
favored independent films such as ""Down in the Valley," "The
Painted Veil," and "The Illusionist."
