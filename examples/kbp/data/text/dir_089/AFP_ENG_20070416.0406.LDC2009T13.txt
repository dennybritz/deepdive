At least 20 people were killed Monday in a shooting rampage at a
US university in Virginia, Virginia Tech police chief Wendell
Flinchum told reporters.


"We have a ballpark figure on fatalities. It's at least 20
fatalities," he said. He confirmed the lone shooter was dead.


Flinchum said it was unclear if the shooter was a student, but
said a number of the victims were.


"Some of the victims were shot in a classroom," he said.
