US President George W. Bush was "horrified" by the school
shootings that left at least 20 people dead at a Virginia
university Monday, the White House said.


"He was horrified, and his immediate reaction was one of deep
concern for the families of the victims, the victims themselves,
the students, the professors and all of the people of Virginia
who have dealt with this shocking incident," said spokeswoman
Dana Perino.
