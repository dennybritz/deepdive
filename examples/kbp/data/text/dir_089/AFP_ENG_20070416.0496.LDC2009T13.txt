The price of gold struck an 11-month high in London on Monday,
breaking through the level of 690 dollars per ounce on demand
stimulated by the current weakness of the dollar, dealers said.


On the London Bullion Market at about 1730 GMT, the price of gold
rose to 690.35 dollars per ounce, from 681.75 dollars late on
Friday, its highest level since May 18, 2006.


"The whole metals complex is being supported by the weakness of
the dollar," said James Moore, an analyst at The Bullion Desk, a
specialist metals market news provider.


Gold is priced in dollars which means that a fall in the value of
the US unit makes the precious metal cheaper to buy for investors
using other currencies.


The price of platinum and palladium also rose on Monday.


The euro is currently trading at its highest levels in over two
years against the dollar.


In late European deals, the euro stood at 1.3550 dollars after
earlier hitting its highest level against the US currency since
January 2005 of 1.3577 dollars.
