A South African man desperate for a visit from the spirit of his
dead mother was convicted by a court on Monday of violating her
grave by extracting teeth from her skull.


Albert Kgwatisi, 30, was ordered to pay a 3,000 rand (420 dollar)
fine or serve a 12-month prison sentence by the court in the
North West province after hearing how he had removed the skull
from the graveyard and then returned it in the company of his 12
-year-old nephew.


According to the SAPA news agency, Kgwatisi told police at the
time of his arrest last month that he had removed two of the
teeth because he wanted the spirit of his mother, who died five
years ago to visit him.


By removing the teeth the man apparently believed his mother
would come looking for them, giving him a chance to see her. He
was caught while trying to return the skull to the graveyard.
