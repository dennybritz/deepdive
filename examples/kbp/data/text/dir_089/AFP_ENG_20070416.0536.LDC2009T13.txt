Ecuadoran election officials said Monday that leftist President
Rafael Correa won his bid to launch a sweeping revision of
Ecuador's constitution, by a larger than three to one margin.


According to an official projection, 81.5 percent of votes cast
Sunday approved of convening a constituent assembly to draft a
new constitution, while 12.7 percent voted against, with 78.4
percent of ballots counted, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal
reported.
