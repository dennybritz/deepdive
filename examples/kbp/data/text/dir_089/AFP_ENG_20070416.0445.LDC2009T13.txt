An unexpected spring snow storm wreaked havoc on eastern Canada
Monday, killing three in a car crash on slippery roads, delaying
flights, and cutting power to thousands of homes.


Almost 40 centimeters (16 inches) of heavy wet snow fell on
southern parts of Ontario and Quebec provinces overnight, as a
low pressure zone moved north from the United States, said
Environment Canada meteorologist Andre Cantin.


Poor visibility and icy roads were blamed in a head-on collision
between a mini- van and a truck that cost three lives northeast
of Montreal. Eleven people were injured in the crash.


Almost 161,000 homes around the metropolis were without
electricity at dawn, after broken tree branches cut power lines,
said a Hydro Quebec spokesman.


Meanwhile, dozens of flights were delayed or cancelled in
Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto as falling snow turned to freezing
rain, airport authorities said.
