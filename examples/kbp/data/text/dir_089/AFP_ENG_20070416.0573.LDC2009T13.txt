A fire has ravaged more than 50 hectares (123 acres) of forest in
Slovakia's central Velka Fatra region and was still not under
control, the head of the local firefighting unit said Monday.


Milan Caban said the fire which broke out Sunday threatened 113
hectares in all. He said five helicopters were battling the
flames as the area was inaccessible by vehicle.


An official from the forestry department said the fire had caused
damages of some 180,000 euros (243,000 dollars).
