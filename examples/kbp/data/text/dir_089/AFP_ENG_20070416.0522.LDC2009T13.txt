The referee in charge of Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat by Racing
Santander on Saturday has lodged a complaint with his local court
over receiving threatening phone calls.


Javier Turienzo enraged Real fans when he awarded Santander two
penalties in the last 20 minutes of the match and sent off two
Real Madrid players, Ivan Helguera and Alvaro Mejia, in the 87th
and 90th minutes respectively.


The national committee of referees said that Turienzo had posted
his complaint with his local justice department in Leon where he
lives.


The defeat and Barcelona's victory on Sunday leaves Real five
points adrift of their bitter rivals in the title race.
