US President George W. Bush has "full confidence" in embattled
World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz, White House spokeswoman Dana
Perino said Monday.


Wolfowitz, a key architect of the war in Iraq, clung to his job
Monday after a stormy week of revelations on a pay scandal
involving his girlfriend that is to be examined soon by the
organization's board of directors.


"The president does have full confidence in Paul Wolfowitz. He
has done a very good job at the World Bank, where they are
working to lift people up out of poverty around the world,"
Perino told reporters.


"He's focussed on Africa and other areas around the world that
need the World Bank's attention. And the president continues to
have confidence in him," she said.


The board, set to meet this week to consider the implications of
the hefty pay hikes given to Wolfowitz's partner from World Bank
coffers, is facing increasing pressure on the scandal.


Asked whether Bush believed Wolfowitz had shown good judgment in
directing that his Libyan-born partner, Shaha Riza, get a bank
pay deal worth nearly 200,000 dollars, Perino demurred.


"What he knows is that Paul Wolfowitz has apologized and the
board at the World Bank is undergoing a review. And I think I'll
have to leave there," she said.
