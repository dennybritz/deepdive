Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal were neck-and-neck for the
first time in a poll of voting intentions for the second round of
France's upcoming presidential elections published Monday.


Socialist candidate Royal and right-wing favourite Sarkozy will
each get 50 percent support if they make it through to the May 6
second round after finishing in the top two places in Sunday's
first ballot, the poll said.


The survey -- conducted by CSA-Cisco for Le Parisien, Aujourd'hui
en France and I Tele -- said Sarkozy was projected to get 27
percent of the vote in the first round, followed by Royal at 25
percent.


Centrist leader Francois Bayrou was in third place at 19 percent
for the first round, ahead of right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
at 15.5 percent.


With at least a third of the electorate still undecided ahead of
Sunday's first round vote, the final stretch of rallies and
debates are set to play a key role in influencing swing voters.


France is choosing a successor to 74-year-old President Jacques
Chirac, in an election widely seen as the most exciting and
important in a quarter of a century.


Twelve candidates are in the fray, including three Trotskyites, a
Communist, a Green and anti-capitalist campaigner Jose Bove, a
hunters' rights campaigner and a Catholic nationalist.


The poll will give a significant boost to the camp of Royal, who
had seen her poll figures starting to slump after a surprisingly
bright start to the campaign.
