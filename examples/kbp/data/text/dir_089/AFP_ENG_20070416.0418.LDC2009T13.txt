Italy was on Monday to send a robot to the seabed to inspect the
remains of a fishing vessel which sank off Sicily in 1996 killing
283 illegal immigrants, mostly from South Asia.


"The aim of this operation is to inspect the shipwreck and to see
if there are any victims lying there, before examining the
possibility of recovering their remains," a statement from
Italy's disaster management centre said.


The robot will be equipped with a camera for the operation about
35 kilometers (22 miles) southeast of Sicily, it added.


A creaky fishing vessel transporting would-be immigrants mainly
from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka sank on December 26, 1996
after hitting bad weather.


A handful of survivors who had disembarked in Greece spoke of
appalling conditions on board.


Greek and Italian authorities have started proceedings against
the boat's Lebanese skipper Yusuf El Hallal, the Greek owner
Eftychios Zervoudakis and 11 others.
