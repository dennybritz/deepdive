Italy's Daniele Contrini won the first stage of the Tour de
Georgia here Monday, covering the 158-kilometer opening leg of
the week-long event in 3 hrs, 24 mins, 26 secs.


Contrini gave the Tinkoff team, which includes American Tyler
Hamilton returning after a two-year doping ban, a first-ever US
stage triumph by outpedaling American Doug Ollerenshaw and
Australian Ben Day to the line.


Ollerenshaw of the Health Net team was second, .21 of a second
behind Contrini, with Day third, another .07 of a second back.


American Mike Sayers of BMC was also in the break group early but
fell back when Contrini made a decisive attack late in the stage.


Tuesday's second stage will be a 217-km trek from Thomaston to
Rome. The race concludes Sunday in Atlanta with a 107.5km circuit
race.
