European Union observers who monitored Nigeria's state
governorship elections last weekend expressed Monday "serious
concerns" about the manner in which they were conducted.


Polling stations had opened late nationwide because officials
arrived late and due to problems with the delivery of polling
materials including ballot papers, the EU mission said in a
statement.


"In a number of areas polling stations did not open at all," the
statement noted.


Observers also criticised under-age voting, failure to guarantee
the secrecy of the ballot and a shortage of electoral officials
that led to party representatives administering the voting
procedure.


There were "incidents of hijacking of ballot boxes by groups of
thugs" as well as irregularities that led to significant
discrepancies between results at polling stations and ballot
collation at local government level, they said.


The statement urged the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC) to ensure that significant improvements were made before
Sunday's federal elections.


"Preparations should have been of a higher standard and must be
substantially improved in the coming days to deliver a credible
and secure process at the federal elections," the statement said.


EU observers were deployed to 33 out of Nigeria's 36 states. For
security reasons they were unable to go into three of the oil-
rich southern states hardest hit by violence and irregularities:
Rivers, Bayelsa and Delta.
