A shooting rampage on a US university campus on Monday left 32
people dead, including the gunman, Virginia Congressman Randy
Forbes told CNN.


"At this particular time, we have been told that there were 31
dead and then additionally, you had the shooter himself who, of
course, is dead at this point in time. So that's a total of 32,"
he said.


On its website, Virginia Tech University confirmed that 22 people
had died, including a gunman, in the deadliest school shooting in
US history.
