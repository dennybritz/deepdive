A Japanese man was sentenced to 21 months in prison by a Los
Angeles court on Monday on charges on trafficking exotic
butterflies.


Hisayoshi Kojima, 57, pleaded guilty to 17 criminal charges
"related to the sale and smuggling of several butterfly species
that he illegally exported to the United States," the US
attorney's office said in a statement.


In addition to the prison sentence, he was ordered to pay a
30,000 dollar fine and nearly 8,000 additional dollars to the US
Fish and Wildlife Service which investigated the case.


Kojima violated US law and international treaties when he
smuggled endangered species -- including a pair of Queen
Alexandra's birdwings which are the largest butterflies in the
world -- into the United States, the statement said.


He smuggled them in by giving false data on customs forms and
sold the pair for 8,500 dollars.


He also offered to sell a Giant Swallowtail butterfly -- an
endangered species from Jamaica which is the largest butterfly in
the western hemisphere -- before he was nabbed.
