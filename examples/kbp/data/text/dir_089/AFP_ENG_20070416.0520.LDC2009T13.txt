US shares leapt higher Monday after banking powerhouse Citigroup
said its profits topped five billion dollars and a group of
equity investors agreed to buy the Sallie Mae student loan giant
for 25 billion dollars.


A government report showing that March retail sales, viewed as a
key indicator of economic prosperity, surged a bigger-than-
forecast 0.7 percent also cheered investors.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up a hefty 108.08
points (0.86 percent) at 12,720.21 just after the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite ended up a strong 26.39 points (1.06
percent) at 2,518.33 while the Standard and Poor's 500 broad-
market index advanced a significant 15.58 points (1.07 percent)
to a preliminary close of 1,468.43.


"The market is strong on the back of Citigroup's earnings," said
Mace Blicksilver, an analyst at Marblehead Asset Management.


Shares surged after banking bellwether Citigroup reported profits
of 5.01 billion dollars for its first-quarter.


Although that marked a profit slowdown, analysts are optimistic
about a wide- ranging overhaul of the banking titan announced
last week by top management.
