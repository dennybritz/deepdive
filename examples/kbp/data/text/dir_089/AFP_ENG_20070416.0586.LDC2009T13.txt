A US astronaut on the International Space Station set a new
sporting record by running the Boston Marathon while in space,
NASA said on Monday.


Sunita Williams set off on the journey in space while harnessed
by bungee cords to a space station treadmill as her earth-bound
counterparts set off in the northeastern US city of Boston for
the annual run.


She "circled the earth at least twice, running as fast as eight
miles (13 kilometers) per hour but flying more than five miles
(eight kilometers) each second," NASA said in a statement.


Williams, an accomplished marathon runner who said she ran in
order to "encourage kids to start making physical fitness part of
their daily lives," finished the 26.2 mile course (42.164
kilometers) in four hours and 24 minutes.


She wore a bib with race number 14,000 and followed the progress
of the earth marathon via laptop computer.


While astronauts typically exercise while in orbit to maintain
bone density under zero gravity conditions, no astronaut has ever
before attempted Williams' marathon feat.


Williams, 41, also had an added advantage of running under better
weather conditions than her Boston counterparts.


"In Boston it was 48 degrees with some rain, mist and wind gusts
of 28 miles (45 kilometers) per hour while station weather was 78
degrees (26 Celsius) with no wind or rain with 50 percent
humidity," NASA said.


She qualified for the Boston marathon after running the Houston,
Texas marathon last year in three hours 29 minutes.
