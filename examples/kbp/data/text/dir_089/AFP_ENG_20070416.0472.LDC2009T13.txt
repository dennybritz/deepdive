Spansish authorities seized 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of
cocaine from a Venezuelan-flagged boat off the coast of Cape
Verde and detained the vessel's seven crew memmers, the economy
ministry said Monday.


A Spanish customs ship intercepted the fishing boat "Alexandra"
in international waters south of Cape Verde on Thursday, the
ministry said.


The seven detained crew members are all Venezuelan citizens, it
added.


Spain, with its historic and linguistic links to South America,
is the main entry point to Europe for cocaine from the continent.


Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony off the west coast of
Africa, is a key trans-shipment point for illicit drugs moving
from Latin America and Asia destined for western Europe.
