Bosnian police on Monday arrested two former Muslim soldiers
suspected of wartime atrocities committed against ethnic Croat
civilians, an official said.


Enes Handzic, 47, and Senad Dautovic, 44, were detained by police
in the central town of Bugojno on a warrant issued by the state
prosecutor.


"They are suspected of war crimes against civilians and prisoners
of war," state prosecution spokesman Boris Grubesic told AFP.


Grubesic said the alleged crimes had been committed in Bugojno in
1993 and 1994, but refused to provide more details.


Bosnia's Croats and Muslims fought against each other at the time
despite having been allies in the fight against Belgrade-backed
Serbs at other stages of the country's 1992-1995 war.
