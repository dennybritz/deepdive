Human rights organisation Amnesty International called on the
Russian authorities Monday to investigate a police crackdown on
anti-government demonstrators.


Around 320 people were arrested amid clashes with police during
protests against Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saint
Petersburg and Moscow on Saturday and Sunday in the lead-up to
national elections.


"The Russian authorities must investigate all complaints of
police brutality," Nicola Duckworth, Amnesty's Europe and central
Asia programme director said in a statement.


"They have a duty to create a climate facilitating complaints by
those who have suffered physical injury, as well as by those who
have been harassed or intimidated.


"The actions of law enforcement officials may have constituted a
violation of the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of
assembly which the authorities have an obligation to provide for,
as well as a violation of the prohibition of ill-treatment."


Amnesty said its observers in Moscow noted human rights
violations including excessive use of force, arbitrary detention
of participants and journalists and denial of the right to legal
defence for those appearing in court.
