Russia's Lidia Grigoryeva won the 111th Boston Marathon women's
title, overcoming world-class rivals and bad weather to capture
the crown here on Monday.


The 33-year-old won the 26-mile showdown in an unofficial time of
2 hrs, 29 mins 18 secs - the slowest winning time since 1985 -
with Latvia's Jelena Prokopcuka second for the second year in a
row and Mexico's Madai Perez third.


All runners battled against heavy rains, blustery winds and
chilling cold but it was Grigoryeva who surged ahead with two
miles remaining when Perez, 27, began to fade and two-time New
York Marathon winner Prokopcuka, 30, could not avoid another
runner-up finish.


Grigoryeva won last year's Los Angeles Marathon and has also
captured the Paris Marathon title.
