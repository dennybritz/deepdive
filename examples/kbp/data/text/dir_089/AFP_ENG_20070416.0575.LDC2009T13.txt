The pressure for political change in Zimbabwe, where opposition
to President Robert Mugabe has grown in recent months, is now
"potentially unstoppable," Britain's minister for Africa said on
Monday.


Speaking in Britain's upper chamber, the House of Lords, Lord
David Triesman added that Britain will "play our part in turning
round this grievous disaster."


Commenting on the intervention and pressure from Zimbabwe's
neighbours, Triesman said: "How do I assess this African
intervention? Well, my assessment in the past has been that it
has been lacklustre."


"Quiet diplomacy has been urged on me. I believe it has mostly
been silent rather than quiet. But I think it is now audible. And
I believe that change is now potentially unstoppable."


Long-standing political tensions in Zimbabwe deteriorated last
month when state security agents assaulted opposition leader
Morgan Tsvangirai and scores of supporters and shot dead an
activist as they broke up an anti-government rally.


Zimbabwe's economy has been on a downturn over the past seven
years characterised by world-record inflation along with four in
every five persons out of work and perennial shortages of
commodities like sugar, and cooking oil.


Over 80 percent of the population is living below the poverty
threshold often skipping meals or cycling or walking long
distances to work in order to stretch their wages.
