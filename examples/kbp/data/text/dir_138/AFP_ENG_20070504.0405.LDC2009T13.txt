Local favourite Philipp Kohlschreiber reached the semi-finals of
Munich's ATP tournament with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) win over France's
Sebastien Grosjean here on Friday.


The 23-year-old German was avenging his compatriot and top seed
Tommy Haas' defeat at the hands of Grosjean in the first round.


Gasquet was undone by his service, twice losing his service game
in the opening set to go 5-3 behind before losing it 6-4.


In the second set he was 4-1 down before mounting a fightback
only to lose out in the tiebreak.


Kohlschreiber, who is aiming to become the first German to win
the Munich ATP since Michael Stich 13 years ago, booked his last
four berth in one hour 30 minutes to set up a meeting with Marcos
Baghdatis.


The number four seed from Cyprus kept his Munich hopes alive
after coming from behind to defeat another German, Alexander
Waske, 2-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.


Tempers flared between the two players when Waske accused
Baghdatis of faking an ankle injury in the second set.


In Friday's other action Russia's third seed Mikhail Youzny cazme
through his quarter-final clash against Jurgen Melzer of Austria
6-2, 7-6 (7/5).
