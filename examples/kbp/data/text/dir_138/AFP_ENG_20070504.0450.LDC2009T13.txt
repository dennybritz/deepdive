A court in Azerbaijan's capital handed jail terms to two
journalists on Friday for publishing an article accused of
inciting religious discord.


In a stormy court session, the article's author, columnist Rafig
Tagi, was handed a three-year sentence while the editor of the
Sanat newspaper that published the article, Samir Sadagatogli,
was sentenced to four years.


The article, published last November, included unfavourable
references to Islam's founder, the prophet Muhammad, and compared
Islam unfavourably with Christianity.


At the final session on Friday, fighting broke out as Islamic
radicals who had attended the hearings threatened to kill the
defendants and other journalists.


Both men were already the subjects of Islamic fatwas calling for
their deaths, issued in Azerbaijan and neighbouring Iran.


The convictions bring to seven the number of journalists jailed
in Azerbaijan in the last 11 months.


The defendants had rejected the charges against them.


"I don't consider myself guilty. I didn't intend to offend
anyone," Tagi told the final court session.


"A person can't be condemned for their opinions," said
Sadagatogli.


On Thursday, the secretary general of the Council of Europe,
Terry Davis, voiced concern about infringements of media freedom
in Azerbaijan, a mainly Muslim ex- Soviet state with a secular
form of government.
