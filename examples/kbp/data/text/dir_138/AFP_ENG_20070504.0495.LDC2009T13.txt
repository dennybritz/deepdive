Turkish lawmakers adopted a law on Friday allowing the state to
block access to Internet sites that are deemed to insult the
country's founder, the Anatolia news agency reported.


The legislation also authorises authorities to cut off access to
sites whose content includes criminal activities, such as the
sexual abuse of minors and prostitution.


Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who proclaimed modern day Turkey in 1923
on the ashes of the Islamic Ottoman Empire, is seen as a national
hero by secular Turks in the mainly Muslim country and his legacy
is protected under a special law.


In March, the country's largest telecommunications provider, Turk
Telekom, blocked access to the popular video-sharing site YouTube
on a court order over a clip that allegedly insulted him.


Users regained access two days later after YouTube removed the
video and Turk Telekom petitioned the court to revoke the ban.
