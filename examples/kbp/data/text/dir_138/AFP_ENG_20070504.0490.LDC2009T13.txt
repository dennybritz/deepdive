Zambian former president Frederick Chiluba defiantly rejected
Friday's court ruling in London convicting him of  conspiring to
rob tens of millions of dollars of public money.


Chiluba, who led Zambia between 1991 and 2001, and his four top
aides were found guilty of conspiring to embezzle 46 million
dollars (33.8 million euros) of public money.


But Chiluba said the London court had no jurisdiction to hear his
case and he was not going to recognise the ruling.


"This outcome was predetermined and I will not recognise it. I
have already insisted that I was not facing charges of crimes
against humanity to be tried by a foreign court," Chiluba said in
a statement Friday in Lusaka.


"The London court had no jurisdiction to hear my case. And that
is why I refuse to appear before it," he added.


Although Chiluba refused to recognise the ruling, Britain hailed
it as an "historic victory for the people of Zambia."


Zambia's current President Levy Mwanawasa has made the fight
against graft the cornerstone of his government's efforts.


Chiluba is still facing the same criminal charges back in Zambia
where his trial was temporarily adjourned because of his illness.
