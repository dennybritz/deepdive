Tickets for US songstress Barbra Streisand's first British
concert in 13 years sold out in 20 minutes Friday, despite their
whopping price tag.


The award-winning singer and actress has now added a second date
at The O2 landmark venue in London, formerly the Millennium Dome.


The cheapest seats for the original July 18 gig cost 100 pounds
(200 dollars, 145 euros), while the most expensive sold for 500
pounds.


Streisand has now worked a second concert on July 22 into her
European tour.


"When you get older it is like trying to do everything you have
missed inyour life and -- except for England -- I have never
performed in Europe," the entertainer has said.


"I love England, I am very at home there, I must have lived there
before in a former life."


Streisand, 65, has been a major star since the 1960s and is known
for such films as 1968's "Funny Girl" and the 1970s pictures "The
Way We Were" with Robert Redford and "A Star is Born".


Her most recent movie role was playing the sex therapist mother
of Ben Stiller's character in the 2004 comedy hit "Meet the
Fockers".


The New Yorker has sold 71 million albums in the United States
alone.
