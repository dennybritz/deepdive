Neither rain, sleet nor snow can stop Canada Post's trusted
carriers from delivering the mail, but a cuddly house cat
believed to be the devil in disguise seems to have done just
that.


According to reports, a Winnipeg couple was refused mail delivery
this week and was asked to walk four kilometers each day to pick
up their letters at a local post office in the western Canadian
city because their cat terrifies the mailwoman.


Canada Post spokeswoman Kathi Neal told AFP the eight-year-old
black cat often sleeps underneath the front steps of the small
bungalow and is "very aggressive" with the carrier when the owner
is not home.


It has "growled and leapt up to try to scratch the mail carrier's
face" on three occasions in the past six months, she said. "It
certainly doesn't like people in uniform."


"I don't think it's really the devil in disguise (as local
newspapers have quipped in headlines), but cats can be every bit
as dangerous as dogs, and are sometimes very territorial," Neal
said, indicating that Canada Post hopes to negotiate a solution
with the pet owner to ensure the safety of its employees.


John Samborski, owner of Shadow the cat, reacted angrily, telling
the Winnipeg Free Press: "We're not putting our carriers at
risk."


"This is Shadow. He likes to eat and sleep and cuddle. You could
drop a bomb and he'd just open one eye, take a look, then close
them and go back to sleep."
