Dave Rowntree, the drummer with top Britpop band Blur, failed to
drum up much support in his bid to become a politician, getting
beaten in quick time as English local election results were
announced Friday.


The musician failed to strike a chord with voters in the
Marylebone High Street ward in central London in his first foray
into politics.


Standing for Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party, he came in
third behind the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates in
a Westminster City Council by-election.


In a clip posted on the video-sharing website YouTube before the
ballot, Rowntree said the campaign had been "good fun."


"I have really enjoyed it and I have learnt a lot," he added.


Blur frontman Damon Albarn was a vocal Labour supporter before
they swept to power in the 1997 general election, but has since
become a Communist.


Blur's biggest hits include "Parklife" (1994), "Country House"
(1995), "Song 2", "Beetlebum (1997) and "Tender" (1999).


One of the biggest British bands of the 1990s alongside Oasis,
the rock group are currently on hiatus.
