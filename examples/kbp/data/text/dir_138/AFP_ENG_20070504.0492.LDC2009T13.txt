European basketball champions CSKA Moscow will get a shot at
defending their title in Sunday's Euroleague finals after edging
out Spain's Unicaja Malaga 62-50 in Athens on Friday.


The Russians were made to sweat for most of their semi-final
against underdogs Unicaja, who had never played in a Euroleague
final before and lacked their injured top scorer and rebounder,
center Daniel Santiago.


The two teams went into the fourth quarter evenly matched at 44
points, but CSKA stole away with dogged defence in the closing
minutes, building an 11-point lead that they clung onto to the
end.


"We missed good shots, well-created shots by players by normally
make them," said Unicaja coach Sergio Scariolo.


"I think we won the game because we played excellent defence,"
said CSKA coach Ettore Messina, congratulating the Spanish side
for "the aggression, the toughness, the heart they put into the
game".


Taunting reporters who were expecting an upset against the
unfancied Spaniards, Messina added, "no upsets this year, you
will get one next year."


American guard Trajan Langdon led the Russians with 13 points and
Australian center David Andersen added 12 points and nine
rebounds.


Spanish guard Carlos Cabezas was the top Unicaja scorer with 13
points.


Europe's version of the NBA, the Euroleague brings together 24
clubs from the continent and broader region, including teams from
Spain, Italy, Greece, France, Turkey and Israel.
