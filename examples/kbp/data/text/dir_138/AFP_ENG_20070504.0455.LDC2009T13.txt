The African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur needs additional
equipment to function properly, Rwanda's defence minister said
Friday.


"If peacekeeping soldiers are better equipped, they can assure
their own security and protect the civilian population, which is
currently forced to look for refuge in displacement camps,"
Marcel Gatsinzi said before the departure of two Rwandan
battalions for the violence-wracked Sudanese region.


Civil war in Darfur began in 2003 and has left some 200,000 dead
and another two million displaced, according to figures from
international organisations and which Sudanese authorities
reject.


The African Union has deployed a peacekeeping force in the region
since 2004 that includes 7,000 soldiers, but officials have
complained of a lack of equipment and manpower for the mission.
