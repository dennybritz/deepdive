Heavy rain in Milan all but washed out Friday's second round at
the Italian Open with almost nine hours of play lost to the
weather.


The second round started on schedule but a deluge half an hour
later rendered the course unplayable until late in the afternoon.


With the round due to be completed early Saturday there was a
three way tie for the lead between Joakim Backstrom, who did not
play a shot all day, Markus Brier and Alvaro Quiros, having
completed eight and ten holes respectively, on 10-under par.


European Tour organisers took the unusual decision of ruling the
50 minutes of play in the morning as null and void as preferred
lies were needed to ensure play got underway at the restart.


Tournament director Jose Maria Zamora reported: "The reaction was
quite positive. The majority of players took the decision all
right, but some didn't think it was right."


One player who made the most of that ruling was England's Richard
Finch.


He set out with a birdie at the 10th and pars at the next two
holes before finding the water at the 13th before play was
suspended.


At the restart he birdied the 10th, 11th and 12th and then double
bogeyed the 13th to end up seven under, three shots off the lead.
