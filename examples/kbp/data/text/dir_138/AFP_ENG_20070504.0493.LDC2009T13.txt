Palermo's city hall has hired 110 new bus drivers -- none of whom
have a license to drive a bus, sources said Friday.


The hirings have come ahead of May 13 and 14 local elections in
the Sicilian city. Election season in Sicily often brings
revelations of questionable municipal hirings, a practice
denounced by critics as a vote-winning tactic.


Italian paper Corriere della Sera reported the bus driver hirings
on Friday and source close to the public transport president
confirmed them.


"For the moment, we can't do anything with them," the source
said. "As long as they have not earned their permits, they are
paid but must wait to be assigned."
