Two policemen were killed Saturday when a Taliban suicide bomber
blew himself up near their patrol convoy in southern Afghanistan,
police said.


The attack in Helmand province's Taliban-infested Nad Ali
district was the latest in a wave of militant attacks this year.


"There was a suicide bombing carried out by an individual in Nad
Ali district this morning. Two of our policemen were martyred and
their vehicle was destroyed," Helmand police commander Mohammad
Nabi Mullahkhil told AFP.


Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahamdi said later the movement was
responsible for the attack. "It was carried out by one our
devoted mujahedin (holy fighters) whose name was Tor Jan."


The Taliban were driven from government in late 2001 and are
waging a guerrilla- style insurgency against the US-backed
government of President Hamid Karzai and its Western backers.


More than 50,000 international troops in the country to help the
fledgling Afghan forces establish security and fight back Taliban
insurgents and their allies, including from Al-Qaeda.


The US-led coalition detained 10 men in raids in southeastern
Zabul province early Saturday on groups "suspected of
facilitating foreign fighters working for the Taliban," it said
in a statement.


"These men are acknowledged facilitators for the Taliban in the
area," said coalition spokesman Major Christopher Belcher. "They
have pushed their way into the homes of locals, demanding food
and shelter, putting innocent families in danger."
