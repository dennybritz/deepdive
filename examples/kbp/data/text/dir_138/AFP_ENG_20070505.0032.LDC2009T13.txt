Communist insurgents kidnapped a town mayor on a Philippine
island south of Manila, killing two of his bodyguards before
releasing him, police said Saturday.


It was the latest in a series of violent attacks in the run-up to
congressional and local elections next week.


Guerrillas of the communist New People's Army (NPA) attacked
Mayor Alex Aranas in Pola town in Mindoro island, 150 kilometres
(93 miles) south of Manila on Friday, killing two of his army
escorts before abducting him.


But Aranas, who is running for re-election as mayor of Pola town
in the May 14 polls, was released late Friday, said police
spokesman Superintendent Samuel Pagbilao.


The circumstances of his case are still being investigated,
Pagbilao added.


The NPA is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, which has been waging a Maoist rebellion against the
government since 1969 in one of the world's longest running
insurgencies.


The guerrillas have been extorting money from political
candidates in return for letting them campaign unhindered ahead
of the May 14 polls.


NPA assassins shot dead a town council candidate in the town of
Daraga late Thursday and dozens of other candidates and campaign
workers have been killed in clashes between rival political
groups in recent weeks.
