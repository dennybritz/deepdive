The Scottish National Party (SNP) won the most seats in the new
Scottish parliament over the previously ruling Labour party of
Prime Minister Tony Blair in Thursday's election, the BBC
reported.


With all 129 seats counted, the SNP -- which has promised a
referendum on independence for Scotland -- had 47 seats, against
46 for the Labour party, it said.
