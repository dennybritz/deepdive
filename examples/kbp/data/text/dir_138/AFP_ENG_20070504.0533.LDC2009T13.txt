Authorities in Fort Lauderdale are trying to figure out who
broadcast a biblical message against homosexuals over the public
announcement system in the Florida city's international airport.


Broward county mayor Josephus Eggelletion personally apologized
on Friday for the incident that prompted a male couple to issue a
complaint.


Someone "entered the PA system in our airport and through that PA
system they uttered a statement that's found in Leviticus 20:13,"
the mayor of the southern Florida city said.


The verse states: "If a man has sexual relations with a man as
one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.
They are to be put to death."


"The statement was inappropiate and I'm here as the mayor of
Broward County to personally apologize," said Eggelletion.


"We do not tolerate these kind of statements. We welcome all
people of all races, of all colors, all ethnicities, all
religions and sexual orientations. We have a very large gay
population, and we're saddened by this incident," he said.
