Cambodia's royal cows signalled a drought and poor harvests in an
ancient ceremony Saturday to mark the beginning of the kingdom's
planting season.


King Norodom Sihamoni and Prime Minister Hun Sen joined thousands
of Cambodians for the annual ceremony as royal astrologers fed
the cows seven dishes -- rice, corn, beans, sesame, grass, water
and rice wine -- laid out on trays.


Hun Sen, who rebuked royal astrologers for failing to predict the
deadly floods in 2001 that claimed 59 lives, said he was hopeful
that the kingdom would be blessed with good harvests.


"We hope all spirits will help Cambodian farmers to get good
agricultural production," the prime minister said at the start of
the traditional ceremony held at a park near Phnom Penh's Royal
Palace.


But the cows only ate corn, meaning Cambodia, one of the world's
poorest nations struggling after three decades of civil war,
could suffer this year.


"The royal cows ate only 45 percent of the corn, which means
Cambodia could suffer a severe drought and bad harvests," chief
astrologer Kang Ken told onlookers.


Cambodia frequently suffers from drought and flooding,
threatening the livelihoods of millions in the impoverished
nation.


While still taken seriously by many rural Cambodians, the
ploughing ceremony predictions have been called into question in
recent years.
