Australian authorities on Saturday rescued a Japanese yachtsman
who was attempting to become the oldest solo sailor to
circumnavigate the world without stopping.


The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said Ikuo
Kashima, 77, hit trouble overnight when his yacht was disabled by
a freak wave in the Southern Ocean about 100 kilometres (62
miles) southwest of Tasmania.


Kashima left Japan nine months ago in an attempt to the break the
record without stopping at any ports, according to his website
www.korasaa77.com.


AMSA spokeswoman Tracey Juggins said Kashina made a distress call
via satellite phone to Japan in the early hours of Saturday
morning after the wave damaged his 12 metre (43 foot) yacht
"Korasaa77."


A police helicopter winched him to safety at about 1:00pm local
time (0300GMT) and he was being taken to a Hobart hospital with
leg and back injuries.


"That gentleman has been successfully lifted into the helicopter
and he's now on his way to South Hobart Hospital," Jiggins told
Australian Associated Press.
