Afghanistan's Taliban have extended the deadline for demands to
be met for the release of a French and three Afghan hostages
until after the May 6 French presidential elections, a spokesman
said Saturday.


"For the sake of the French nation we have extended the deadline
for the French hostage and his Afghan colleagues until the end of
the French elections," spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP by
telephone.
