Hundreds of Islamic militants Saturday smashed car cassette
players, camera cell phones and ordered tribesmen to grow beards
in a Pakistani tribal area bordering Afghanistan, witnesses and
officials said.


Some 300 armed bearded men took dozens of cassette players from
cars and snatched mobile phones with built-in cameras and
destroyed them at two main markets near Khar, the main town of
Bajaur tribal district, they said.


The group which calls itself "Mujahedin" (Islamic warriors) said
music and photos were against Islamic sharia law and warned
clean-shaven men of "strict action" if they did not grow beards,
an AFP reporter in the area said.


The Mujahedin also preached at local shopkeepers to stop carrying
out various businesses which were against sharia.


A local administration official confirmed the incident, saying
"it was peaceful."


The latest incident comes two days after suspected Islamic
militants blew up music shops with crude home-made devices at
three markets late Thursday in the town of Charsada in Islamist-
ruled North West Frontier Province.


Islamic militancy is widespread in the deeply-conservative
province ruled by an alliance of six hardline Islamic parties.


Its deeply religious tribal areas along the Afghan border are a
stronghold of pro-Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants who sneaked in
after the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001.


The Taliban banned music, dancing and shaving of beards under
their ultra-strict interpretation of Islam.
