Moroccan authorities have charged 23 suspects in connection with
suicide bombings carried out last month, a legal source said
Friday.


Those charged include a 17-year-old younger brother of two
Moroccans who blew themselves up in attacks in March and April in
the port city of Casablanca.


They face charges of preparing "terrorist" acts targeting public
security, the source said.


Five suicide bombers blew themselves up in Casablanca between
April 10 and April 14. The explosions followed another suicide
bombing in the city on March 11.


A total of 54 people have been jailed in connection with the
March and April attacks.
