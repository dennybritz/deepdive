UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour hailed
Saturday Turkmenistan's progress in adhering to international
rights norms during her two-day trip to the Central Asian state.


"The High Commissioner welcomed Turkmenistan's ratification of
most major human rights instruments and the submission by the
government of three reports to the treaty bodies" including the
committees on racial discrimination, discrimination of women and
child's rights, her office said in a statement.


Arbour also "welcomed the recent reforms undertaken in the area
of education," the statement added.


The commissioner also called on Ashkhabad to ratify the
"remaining international human rights instruments" including the
protocol against torture, and pay more attention to analysis and
data sharing which would encourage more reforms.


Major global powers have watched closely for signs of change in
the country because of its vast natural gas reserves and its
strategic location next to Afghanistan.


Last month the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) welcomed "positive" early signals from
Turkmenistan's new president, but rights groups have remained
sceptical.


Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov took power in the resource-rich
central Asian country in February following the death in December
of the country's first post- Soviet leader, the dictator and
president-for-life Saparmurat Niyazov.
