"Baywatch" television star David Hasselhoff has admitted to
relapsing in his battle with the bottle after being filmed
apparently drunk and half naked while trying to eat a burger.


The video, believed to have been shot three months ago by
Hasselhoff's teenaged daughter, shows the actor and singer lying
on the floor wearing only a pair of jeans while a young female
urges him to quit drinking.


In a statement, the television star said he had suffered a
relapse but that he was now back in control of his alcoholism.


"I am a recovering alcoholic... Unfortunately, one evening I did
have a brief relapse, but part of recovery is relapse," he said.
He said the video just proved the "honest and positive
relationship" he had with his children.


"I have seen the tape. I have learned from it and I am back on my
game."


Hasselhoff, who starred in small-screen hits such as "Baywatch"
and "Knight Rider," reached worldwide fame in the 1980s for his
role as Michael Knight, starring alongside a talking car.
