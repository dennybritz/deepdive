Myanmar's detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was in good
health after her doctor and an eye specialist visited her for a
routine check-up, a party spokesman said Saturday.


"She is in good condition," said Lwin, a spokesman of Aung San
Suu Kyi's opposition party, the National League for Democracy.
The two doctors saw her on Thursday, the spokesman said, but
declined to give further details.


"We don't know exactly about her eye problem," said Lwin, who
goes by only one name.


Military-ruled Myanmar has put the 61-year-old Nobel Peace Prize
winner under house arrest at her rambling lakeside home in Yangon
for most of the past 17 years.


Apart from her live-in maid, Aung San Suu Kyi is allowed no
contact with the outside world, except for around once-a-month
visits from her doctor, Tin Myo Win.


When the ruling junta granted a rare meeting between Aung San Suu
Kyi and a senior UN envoy here in November, the opposition leader
told the visiting diplomat, Ibrahim Gambari, that she would like
to receive more medical care.


Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962. Aung San Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in
1990 elections, but the junta never allowed it to take office.


Her latest period in detention began after a May 2003 attack on
her convoy by a junta-backed militia in the country's central
region.


She was thrown into prison after the assault but, following a
gynaecological operation four months later, was allowed to return
home -- again under house arrest.


The latest term of house arrest is up for review on May 27.
