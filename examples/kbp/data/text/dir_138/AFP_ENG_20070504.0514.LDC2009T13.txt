St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Josh Hancock was almost twice over
the legal blood alcohol limit when he died in a road accident
last weekend, the St. Louis medical examiner announced on Friday.


Hancock died shortly after midnight on Sunday when his vehicle
smashed into the back of a tow truck which was attending a
previous accident on a St. Louis highway.


Medical examiner Michael Graham said Hancock had a blood alcohol
level of 0.157 percent. The legal driving limit is 0.08 percent.


Police Chief Joe Mokwa said 8.55 grams of marijuana and a glass
pipe used to smoke marijuana were also found in Hancock's rented
car.


Toxicology tests to determine if other drugs were in Hancock's
system have not been completed.


Hancock, who was 29, died instantly of severe head injuries. He
was not wearing a seat belt.


Players and coaches of the Cardinals were among an estimated 500
mourners who attended a memorial service Thursday in Tupelo,
Mississippi, for Hancock.


Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said the team had no indication
that Hancock had an ongoing problem with alcohol or drugs.


"There wasn't anything that we knew, and I mean guys on the
coaching and training staff, that would make us think there was a
problem," La Russa said.


"My answer to people who are mourning is that he deserves the
benefit of the doubt.


"I do not think watching him for a year and a month you can
compete at the level he competed at and be ready to compete, and
whatever assignment he was given he took it. It is hard to be
incapacitated and have horrible habits. I have seen people on
drugs and they do not compete like that."
