Paleontologists unearthed a flesh-eating dinosaur some 150
million years old in southern Argentina with all its joints in
place, the first time such a beast has been dug up so intact, one
of the finders told AFP on Friday.


The seven-meter (23-foot) tall, two-legged dinosaur, dubbed the
Condorraptor, was found fossilized with parts of its jaw and head
showing in rock near the village of Cerro Condor in Patagonia, at
a site where paleontologists had been working for five years.


"It is an unprecedented discovery. It is the first time in the
world that a carnivorous dinosaur of the Middle Jurassic period
has been found fully jointed," said Pablo Puerta, a
paleontologist at the Egidio Feruglio museum in the town of
Trelew.


Working in the southern province of Chubut, the team led by the
German dinosaur specialist Oliver Rauhut uncovered the fossil
using a giant crane to shift rock.


Puerta said it will take about a year to fully uncover the
dinosaur. It could then go on display at the Trelew museum.
