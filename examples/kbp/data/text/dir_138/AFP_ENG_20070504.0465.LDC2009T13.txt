Kenya must put and end to politically-sparked ethnic clashes that
have forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes
across the country, human rights groups said Friday.


Around 380,000 people have been displaced by different conflicts
that first erupted in 1991, one year before the country's first
multi-party elections, the International Federation of Human
Rights and the Kenya Human Rights Commission said in a report.


The figure ranks Kenya the seventh among African nations with the
most internally displaced people, they said.


The groups demanded Kenyan authorities "decisively deal with the
politically instigated ethnic clashes at the time of elections."


Kenya is to hold general elections by the end of this year and in
the past the run-up to polls have been fraught with tensions and
at times turned violent.


After 1992 elections, violence continued unabated for four years,
killing more than 15,000 people and displaced nearly 300,000 in
three provinces.


And in the run-up to the 1997 polls, more than 100 people were
killed and more than 100,000 displaced, it said.
