Oscar de la Hoya weighed in at the super-welterweight limit of
154 pounds, four pounds heavier than undefeated Floyd Mayweather
here Friday on the eve of their boxing showdown.


The US fighters will meet Saturday for de la Hoya's World Boxing
Council super- welterweight crown in what could be the farewell
bout for both.


Mayweather is 37-0 with 24 knockouts while de la Hoya is 38-4
with 30 knockouts entering what promoters expect to be one of the
top revenue fights in boxing history.


Mayweather, 30, moves up to the heaviest weight class of his
career and his 154 pounds (69.85kg) will surpass his previous
highest fight weight of 147 pounds (66.67kg), which he weighed 18
months ago in a sixth-round stoppage of compatriot Sharmba
Mitchell.


De la Hoya, 34, is in only his second fight in 2 1/2 years. A
year ago, he stopped Nicaragua's Ricardo Mayorga in the sixth
round at 153 pounds (69.39kg).


This is the third-heaviest weight in a bout for de la Hoya, who
weighed a career-high 160 pounds in a 2004 victory over Felix
Sturm.
