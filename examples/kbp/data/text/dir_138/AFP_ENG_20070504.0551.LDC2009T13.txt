An apparently doomed multi-billion dollar takeover offer for
Australian airline Qantas spluttered back to life Saturday after
the bidders said they received last-minute support from a large
investor.


The Airline Partners Australia (APA) consortium said the support
took shareholder acceptances to 50.6 percent, just above the 50
percent threshold needed to keep the 11.1 billion dollar (9.2
billion US) bid alive.


It was a major reversal for APA, which said late Friday that its
six-month campaign to gain control of the iconic Australian
carrier had all but ended because of insufficient acceptances.
