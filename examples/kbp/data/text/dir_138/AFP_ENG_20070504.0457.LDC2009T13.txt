Germany said Friday it had turned down an Afghan request to send
19 military instructors to southern Afghanistan, a particularly
troubled part of the country.


The German parliament's mandate for German troops authorizes them
to venture outside their northern base area only in exceptional
circumstances and the Afghan request did not meet that condition,
defence ministry spokesman Thomas Raabe said.


Germany has about 3,000 troops in Afghanistan in a mission that
has sparked considerable controversy in the country wary of
sending troops into combat six decades after the end of World War
II.


Most of the soldiers are in the relatively calm north and the
government has resisted calls to send them to areas such as the
south and east where NATO troops are facing the fiercest fighting
and have called for reinforcements.


Other NATO members have been putting pressure on Germany to
redeploy troops further south, especially Canada, which lost 36
soldiers last year in the Kandahar province.


Last month, one of six German Tornado jets in Afghanistan was
damaged when the landing gear broke before touchdown.


The jets have been carrying out air surveillance and
reconnaissance across the country in support of NATO-led troops
battling Taliban rebels.


The mandate of the planes does not include routine combat
operations.
