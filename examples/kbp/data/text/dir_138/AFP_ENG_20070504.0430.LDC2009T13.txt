A former Somali warlord was sworn in as mayor of the capital
Mogadishu on Friday, handing in weapons to the government and
pledging to bring peace to the war-torn city.


"This town needs peace after many years of bloodshed and criminal
acts. We have to be cautious and take steps against insecurity,"
said Mohamed Omar Habeb, the former ruler of Somali Middle
Shabelle region before his ouster by Islamists last year.


He also handed over weapons to the government in a bid to
encourage the public to disarm.


"In this monumental ceremony, I want to take advantage and hand
10 armed vehicles to the interior minister. The armed vehicles
will be part of patrolling forces in Mogadishu."


"We need to show strength and make peace in Somalia, particularly
in Mogadishu."


Last month, the government appointed Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid,
also a former warlord, as Mogadishu police chief.


Ethiopian-Somali troops drove out an Islamist movement from
swathes of central and southern Somalia, including Mogadishu, at
the start of the year.


But since then, the Somali capital has seen an upsurge in clashes
between Ethiopian forces and Islamist insurgents and clan
fighters opposed to their presence.


Efforts to disarm civilians have failed due to the reluctance of
the public to hand over weapons to a government largely seen as
ineffective and unable to guarantee security.
