Stephen Maguire held the upper hand over his fellow scot John
Higgins at the end of Friday's evening session in the best of 33
semi-final showdown at the snooker world championships.


Level at 8-8 after the mid session interval Maguire took leave of
the Crucible for the night holding a 14-10 advantage and just
three frames away from a place in the final.


Maguire dominated the third session, capturing two of the opening
three frames to take control for the first time.


He also took the 51 minute fourth frame, capping that with a 131
clearance.


Higgins hit back with a 134 clearance of his own before Maguire
took the evening's final two frames.


The other semi-final, an all English affair, between 2005
champion Shaun Murphy and Mark Selby, was finely poised at 8-8.


Selby fought back from 5-3 down to level in a battle of wits with
his 128 clearance to go 7-6 up the highlight of the session.


Higgins will regain the world number one spot for the first time
in seven years if he goes further in the tournament than Murphy -
the only player who can overhaul him.
