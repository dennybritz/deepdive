Air traffic controllers picked up a distress signal from the
missing Kenya Airways airliner just after it took off from Douala
airport in Cameroon, an aviation source said Saturday.


The signal was picked up by satellite at 2.00 am (0100 GMT), a
source close to the Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in
Africa told AFP.


The Boeing 737-800, which had 115 people on board, lost radio
contact after taking off in a violent storm, the source said. It
was reported missing Saturday morning by Kenya Airways after it
failed to arrive in Nairobi.


Two Cameroonian army helicopters on Saturday began searching a
wide area south of the line between Douala and the capital
Yaounde, 250 kilometres (180 miles) to the east, to try to locate
the aircraft.
