Gaza militants fired three rockets at southern Israel on Saturday
causing no casualties but damaging a building in the town of
Sderot, an army spokesman said.


The hardline Islamic Jihad group said it carried out the attack
in retaliation for the killing of three of its militants by the
Israeli army near the northern West Bank town of Jenin on Friday.


"This is our first riposte to the crimes of the Zionist enemy
which assassinated three heroes of the Al-Quds Brigades (Islamic
Jihad's military wing)," the group said in a statement.


Islamic Jihad was not party to a November truce under which
Israeli troops pulled out of Gaza in return for a commitment from
militant groups to end rocket fire from the territory.


But it did take part in Egyptian-brokered talks last month aimed
at shoring up the truce after the armed wing of the Hamas
movement of prime minister Ismail Haniya briefly announced it
would no longer respect it.
