Sri Lankan naval craft sank two suspected Tamil Tiger boats off
the island's northeastern coast Saturday, inflicting heavy losses
on the guerrillas, a navy official said.


Patrol craft engaged a flotilla of boats of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) off the coast of Pulmoddai and sank two out
of two dozen boats, an official said.


"We believe there were 12 to 16 LTTE cadres in the two boats that
were sunk," the official said adding that two navy sailors were
wounded in a fire fight with the Tiger flotilla.


There was no immediate word from the Tigers about the pre-dawn
sea battle.


The LTTE has waged a 35-year campaign for independence that has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,800 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005.
