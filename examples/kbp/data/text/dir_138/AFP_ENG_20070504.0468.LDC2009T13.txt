Estonian police said Friday they suspect a Russian who lives in
Moscow of being behind Internet postings calling for the armed
overthrow of the Estonian government.


"We have established that the calls for armed attacks on
Estonia's independence, which began to circulate on Russian-
language websites at the end of last month, were instigated by 22
-year-old Alexei, a citizen of the Russian Federation residing in
Moscow," security police spokeswoman Irina Mikson told AFP.


"We are investigating his links with Estonia," Mikson said.


"Preliminary evidence suggests the calls are no real threat," she
added.


The appeal, which calls for the creation of a "Russian Resistance
Army" to fight the Estonian government, was posted on the
Internet after rioting in Tallinn last week over the removal of a
Soviet war memorial.


Russians, including the large minority that lives in Estonia, see
the statue as a memorial to the millions of Red Army soldiers who
died fighting Nazism in World War II, while Estonians view it as
a reminder of 50 years of Soviet occupation.


The Bronze Soldier has been re-installed in a military cemetery
in Tallinn, where it is due to be formally inaugurated on May 8.
