Spain's Princess Letizia, accompanied by her husband Crown Prince
Felipe, left a Madrid hospital on Friday with the couple's
newborn second child, a baby girl named Sofia.


Princess Letizia, wearing a rose-pink suit, cradled Sofia who was
wrapped in a white blanket, while Prince Felipe carried their
firstborn child Leonor in his arms as a crowd of some 350
journalists, photographers and well-wishers looked on.


Sofia, who was born by caesarean section on Sunday, slept through
her first public appearance. Named after her grandmother, Queen
Sofia, she is third-in- line to the Spanish throne, after her
father and sister, who was born in October 2005.


"It really pleased both of us that she shares her name with the
Queen, who I believe was enchanted," Letizia, a former television
news anchorwoman, told reporters when asked about the couple's
choice of name for their newborn.


Princess Letizia, 34, and Prince Felipe, 39, married in a
glittering royal wedding in May 2004.


The Spanish constitution currently allows a female heir to the
throne only if she has no brothers.


But the socialist government of Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero is looking into changing the constitution to
give female royals the same right as males to accede to the
throne, a move which would guarantee Leonor's ascension.
