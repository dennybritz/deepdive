Indian skipper Rahul Dravid suffered a nose injury during
practice here on Saturday, two days before the team's departure
for a tour of Bangladesh.


A bouncer from left-arm paceman R.P. Singh hit the visor of
Dravid's helmet as he practised in the nets and his nose was cut.


The Indian captain was rushed to hospital but an X-ray ruled out
a fracture, private broadcaster Star News reported.


The Indian team leave for Bangladesh on May 7 to play three one-
dayers followed by a two-match Test series.


The first one-dayer will be played on May 10 in Dhaka.


There were no further details on the tour immediately available.
