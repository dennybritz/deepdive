Israeli forces shot dead three Palestinian militants during heavy
exchanges of fire on Friday in a village in the north of the
occupied West Bank, Palestinian medical sources said.


The three members of the radical Islamic Jihad movement were
killed in a gun battle in Silat al-Harithiya west of the town of
Jenin, the sources said.


An Israeli army spokesman said that "Palestinian gunmen opened
fire on a Border Police force carrying out an arrest raid. The
force returned fire and identified hitting three of them."


According to Israeli security sources, the clash broke out after
militants identified and then opened fire at a vehicle carrying
an under-cover Israeli force. There were no casualties among the
Israelis.


Friday's deaths bring to 5,678 the number of people killed since
the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000,
the vast majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP
count.
