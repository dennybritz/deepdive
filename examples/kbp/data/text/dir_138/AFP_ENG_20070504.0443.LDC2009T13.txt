The United States is "very satisfied" with the just-completed
Iraq conference in Egypt and has no regrets that the meeting did
not yield high-level US-Iran talks, the White House said Friday.


"A meeting with the Iranians was never on the agenda,"
spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters, noting that the US
ambassador to Iraq met briefly with a low- level Iranian diplomat


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with her Syrian
counterpart on the sidelines of the gathering at the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, but did not have talks with Iran's
foreign minister.


"If the opportunity would have presented itself to meet with the
Iranians as well, I think that the secretary would have been
pleased to talk with them. It didn't," spokeswoman Dana Perino
told reporters.


US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker said he met a deputy foreign
minister of Iran but played down the event. "It was very limited,
very short and it was on Iraq," he told reporters.


"He said it was brief, but they did have a conversation," said
Perino.


"Overall for the meeting that took place in Sharm el-Sheikh,
we're very satisfied, but there's follow-up to do," she said,
noting that US President George W. Bush was sending Vice
President Dick Cheney to the region next week.
