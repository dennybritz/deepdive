The European Union welcomed Friday an agreement between Ukraine's
president and prime minister to hold early parliamentary
elections and said it could end their political standoff.


"This agreement paves the way for a solution to the country's
political crisis," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said in
a statement.


"I commend the commitment of both leaders to ensuring that these
elections will be free and fair," he said, while also encouraging
a working group of political leaders "to agree on the steps
needed to implement today's agreement."


He underlined that Ukraine is a close partner for the EU and that
"reforms are of crucial importance for the quality of this
deepening partnership."


Ukraine has been locked in crisis since April 2 when the Russian-
backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych defied an order from pro-
Western head of state Viktor Yushchenko to dissolve parliament
and hold early elections.


No date was announced for the elections.
