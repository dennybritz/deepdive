Seven of the first nine stages at the Rally of Argentina were
cancelled on Friday due to the weather.


Several drivers failed to make it to Cordoba for the rally as
they were stuck in Buenos Aires airport, grounded by bad weather.


The main championship contenders, including world champion
Sebastien Loeb of France and championship leader Marcus Gronholm
of Finland, were aboard the one plane that managed to take off
from Buenos Aires late on Thursday night.


Only the first stage of the rally, held in the River Plate
stadium on Thursday night, has been held with Finland's Mikko
Hirvonen in a Ford Focus setting the fastest time.


No decision has yet been made on whether or not Friday's final
stage nine will be held.
