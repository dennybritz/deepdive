Air traffic controllers picked up a distress signal from the
missing Kenya Airways airliner just after it took off from Douala
airport in Cameroon, officials said Saturday.


The signal was picked up by satellite at 2.00 am (0100 GMT), a
source close to the Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in
Africa (ASECNA) told AFP.


The last communication between the pilot and air traffic control
at Douala was two minutes after the Boeing 737-800 took off at
11.15 pm (0315 GMT) in a violent storm, the ASECNA source said.


The plane, which had originated in Abidjan and had 115 people on
board, was reported missing Saturday morning by Kenya Airways
after it failed to arrive in Nairobi.


In the last radio message the pilot "simply confirmed that the
plane had taken off," the source said. Shortly afterwards it
disappeared from radar screens.


Two Cameroonian army helicopters on Saturday began searching a
wide area south of the line between Douala and the capital
Yaounde, 250 kilometres (180 miles) to the east, to try to locate
the aircraft.


All the police in the zone have also been mobilised in the
search, which is concentrating on the area between Eseka and
Ebolowa, in a dense forest region southwest of the capital.


Cameroonian authorities have set up two emergency centres, one in
Yaounde and the other in Douala, to coordinate search operations.
