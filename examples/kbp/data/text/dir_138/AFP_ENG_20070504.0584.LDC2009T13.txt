Tens of thousands of Peruvian miners Friday ended a nationwide
strike for better wages after reaching a deal with the
government, unions and the government said.


"The government has a 60-day deadline to make good on the points
agreed in the deal that has been signed," the head of the
federation of miners, metal and ironworkers unions Luis Castillo
told reporters.


He said the government had responded favorably to the
federation's demands.


The workers had called for pay hikes, better pension schemes, and
want 80,000 workers to be given proper contracts.


At least 30,000 of the country's 120,000 miners, from 33 trade
unions, downed their tools when the indefinite strike started
Monday, the union said earlier. Workers for the US-run Doe Run
mine had joined in on Friday.


Labor Minister Susana Pinilla called on mining companies to
respect their workers's rights in a sector which is very
important for the country's development.


She said she would meet on Saturday with workers from the
Chinese-owend Shougang mining company to finalize negotiations on
their demands.
