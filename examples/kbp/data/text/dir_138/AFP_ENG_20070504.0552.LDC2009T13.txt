An apparently doomed multi-billion dollar takeover offer for
Australian airline Qantas spluttered back to life Saturday after
the bidders said they received last-minute support from a large
investor.


The Airline Partners Australia (APA) consortium said the support
took shareholder acceptances to 50.6 percent, just above the 50
percent threshold needed to keep the 11.1 billion dollar (9.2
billion US) bid alive.


It was a major reversal for APA, which said late Friday that its
six-month campaign to gain control of the iconic Australian
carrier had all but ended because of insufficient acceptances.


"On Friday evening, APA announced that, subject to confirmation,
it appeared that the offer had failed to reach the 50 percent
level required for the offer to proceed," the consortium said in
a statement.


"However, subsequently on Friday, APA received an acceptance from
a large investor, which would be sufficient to take acceptances
for Qantas shares to more than 50 percent.


"APA intends to make submissions to the Takeovers Panel to allow
the offer to continue."


The last-gasp reprieve gives APA two weeks to try to take
shareholder acceptances up to 70 percent, the level needed to
finalise the takeover and make the bid unconditional.
