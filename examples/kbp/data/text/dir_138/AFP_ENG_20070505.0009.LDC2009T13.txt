At least eight people died after jumping off a Bangladesh cruiser
to flee security guards who were seeking to break up a brawl,
police said on Saturday.


The trouble began late Friday when drunken passengers got into a
fight over women as the boat drew near the main port in the
capital Dhaka.


When the vessel reached harbour, baton-wielding security guards
boarded.


As about 100 people scrambled over the sides towards other boats
to flee the guards some of them fell into the water and drowned.


"So far, eight bodies have been recovered. Three to four people
are still missing," Dhaka district police Ibrahim Fatemi said.


"There were two groups (on the cruise vessel) and they were
fighting over some girls," a security guard told Bangladesh's
private CSB television station.


The cruise passengers had taken picnics on board.


Picnicking is a favourite past-time for millions of Bangladeshis
whose nation is criss-crossed with rivers.
