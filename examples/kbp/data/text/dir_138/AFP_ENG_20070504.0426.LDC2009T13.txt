The Scottish National Party (SNP) won the most seats in the new
Scottish parliament over the ruling Labour party of Prime
Minister Tony Blair in Thursday's election, the BBC reported.


With all 129 seats counted, the SNP -- which has promised a
referendum on independence for Scotland -- had 47 seats, against
46 for the Labour party, it said.


The conservatives had 17 seats, the Liberal Democrats 16 and
other, smaller parties three seats between them.


The figures -- not immediately confirmed officially -- came after
delays and problems with new ballot papers and electronic
counting machines overshadowed the vote, which could end Labour's
50-year stranglehold over Scottish politics.


Because of the combination of majority and proportional voting, a
coalition is likely in the parliament, which has limited powers
in areas like health and education.


That means negotiations for power-sharing, with the Liberal
Democrats likely power-brokers, will dominate the days ahead.
