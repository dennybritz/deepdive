Authorities in Italy issued arrest warrants Friday for an Italian
mayor, his environmental assistant and eight others suspected of
involvement in a scam to illegally traffic toxic waste.


Fernando Fumagalli, the mayor of Montefiascone, a district near
Rome, and his environmental assistant Valdo Napoli are accused of
taking bribes and have been placed under house arrest, police
said.


"The operation has shone light on the existence of a well-
organised structure whose aim is to traffick and illegally treat
waste ... like sewage sludge containing strong concentrations of
lead, nickel, zinc and mercury," a police statement said.


Two businessmen have already been arrested over the alleged scam.
