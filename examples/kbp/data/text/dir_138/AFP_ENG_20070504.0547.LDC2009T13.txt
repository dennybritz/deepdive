The famous Dodge Charger from 1980s television show "The Dukes of
Hazzard" has sold via an Internet auction for an astonishing 9.9
million dollars, according to a page on eBay.com.


The 1969 car, known in the series as the "General Lee" and the
nemesis of Sheriff Roscoe P.Coltrane in numerous chase scenes,
was sold by actor John Schneider, who played Bo Duke in the long-
running show.


It is believed to be the second highest price for a car sold at
auction in history. The most expensive car in history was a 1931
Bugatti sold at auction by Christie's in 1987 for 11 million
dollars.


Schneider's car had been customized with a 8.3 liter engine
capable of generating 725 horsepower, with only 16,000 kilometres
on the odometer.


The Dodge Charger was one of the most symbolic vehicles of
America's "muscle car" era, which ended after the 1973 oil
crisis.
