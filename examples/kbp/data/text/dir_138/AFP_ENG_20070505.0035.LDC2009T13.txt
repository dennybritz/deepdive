Air traffic controllers picked up a distress signal from the
missing Kenya Airways airliner just after it took off from Douala
airport in Cameroon, an aviation source said Saturday.


The signal was picked up by satellite at 2.00 am (0100 GMT), a
source close to the Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in
Africa told AFP.
