More than 10 Taliban commanders, including one freed from jail in
exchange for an Italian hostage, were killed in fighting in
western Afghanistan a week ago, military officials said Saturday.


The April 27 and 29 clashes involving US-led coalition and Afghan
troops in the western province of Herat have been overshadowed by
claims of heavy civilian casualties, with investigations finding
about 50 civilians died.


The coalition, which said last week the troops killed 136 Taliban
fighters, is investigating the allegations.


"Coalition and Afghan national security forces have received
intelligence which indicates over 10 Taliban commanders were
among those killed during fighting...," a coalition statement
said.


"One of the senior Taliban commanders reportedly killed was from
Helmand province and recently released with four other Taliban
members in exchange for an Italian journalist who was taken
hostage two months ago.


"Two other senior Taliban commanders, believed to have been
killed in the battles, were known enemies of the Afghan
government for the past three years."


A senior official in the Afghan defence ministry confirmed the
coalition statement. "A big number of senior Taliban commanders
were among those killed," he said on condition of anonymity.


"A Taliban commander swapped for the Italian journalist was also
killed.'
