Afghanistan's Taliban have extended the deadline for demands to
be met for the release of a French and three Afghan hostages
until after the May 6 French presidential elections, a spokesman
said Saturday.


"For the sake of the French nation we have extended the deadline
for the French hostage and his Afghan colleagues until the end of
the French elections," spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP by
telephone.


Ahmadi did not give a new deadline but said it would be "after
the results of the French presidential elections," which is being
held on Sunday.


Terre d'Enfance (A World For Our Children) aid worker Eric
Damfreville and three Afghans working with him were captured in
southwestern Afghanistan on April 3.


A Frenchwoman abducted with them, Celine Cordelier, was released
last Saturday when the Taliban also extended by a week for its
demands to be met.


The extremist group is demanding the withdrawal of French troops
or the release of Taliban prisoners in exchange for its hostages.


If the demands were not met, a council of elders would decide on
the fate of the four, Ahmadi said last week. Asked if they could
be killed, Ahmadi said the group's policy was "clear."


The militants have executed several Turks and Indians, but they
have claimed responsibility for only one killing of a western
hostage, a British engineer in 2005.
