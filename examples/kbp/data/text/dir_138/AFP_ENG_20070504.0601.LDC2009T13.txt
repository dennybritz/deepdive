Kawasaki rider Olivier Jacque will fly to his home in Spain after
suffering a deep gash to his arm in a practice session crash at
the Moto Grand Prix of China, his team said Saturday.


"He's flying back to Spain today where his wife is and will
consult with doctors there," a team spokeswoman said.


The Frenchmen went down hard on his MotoGP during Friday's
afternoon practice, opening up a deep wound on the inside of his
right forearm that required immediate surgery and his airlifting
to Shanghai's Huashan hospital.


"At the moment it's not clear how Olivier received the injury to
his forearm, but the most likely cause is that his arm was
trapped under the bike in the crash," a team statement said.


Jacque, 33, a former 250cc world champion, tore muscle and skin,
but doctors decided that he did not require a skin graft as was
initially feared.


The spokeswoman could not say whether Jacque would be healthy for
the Grand Prix of France in two weeks time.
