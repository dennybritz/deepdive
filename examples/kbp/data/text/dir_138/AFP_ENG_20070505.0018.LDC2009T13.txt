A Kenya Airways airliner with 115 people on board went missing
Saturday morning on a flight from Abdijan to Nairobi via Douala,
the company said.


"Flight KQ 507 was coming from Abidjan via Douala. The aircraft
unfortunately has not arrived," Titus Naikuni, the company's
chief executive officer, told a news conference in Nairobi.


The plane, a Boeing 737-800 carrying 106 passengers, eight crew
members and a flight engineer, was due to land in Nairobi on
Saturday at 6.15 am (0315 GMT).


"The last message from the aircraft was received at the control
tower immediately after take off. After, the tower lost contact
with the aircraft. So far, no one has been able to establish
contact with the aircraft," Naikuni said.


Most of the passengers were connecting through Nairobi to other
destinations outside Kenya.


A crisis centre has been set up at the company headquarters at
Nairobi airport.
