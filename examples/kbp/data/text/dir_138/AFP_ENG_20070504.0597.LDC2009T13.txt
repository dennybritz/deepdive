Australian authorities launched a rescue operation Saturday to
save a Japanese yachtsman who was attempting to become the oldest
solo sailor to circumnavigate the world without stopping.


The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said Ikuo
Kashima, 77, hit trouble overnight when his yacht was disabled by
a freak wave in the Southern Ocean about 100 kilometres (62
miles) southwest of Tasmania.


Kashima departed Japan nine months ago in an attempt to the break
the record without stopping at any ports, according to his
website www.korasaa77.com.


AMSA spokeswman Tracey Juggins said Kashina made a distress call
via satellite phone to Japan in the early hours of Saturday
morning after the wave damaged his 12 metre (43 foot) yacht
"Korasaa77."


"He seems okay within himself but he does have a sore back and a
sore leg and he's finding mobility difficult, which is why it's
essential for us to get out there and assist him off the yacht,"
she said.


Juggins said Kashima spoke no English and was communicating with
authorities in the Tasmanian capital Hobart through an
interpreter.


A plane was due to leave Hobart early Saturday to locate the
vessel and a police helicopter was on standby to winch the
septuagenarian to safety once he was found.


"The conditions are a little bit inclement at the moment but
still they're okay in terms of us being able to get the
helicopter out there," Ms Jiggins said.
