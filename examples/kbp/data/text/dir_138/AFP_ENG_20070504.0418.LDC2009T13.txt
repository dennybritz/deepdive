Five more US soldiers have been killed in attacks in Baghdad and
the restive western province of Anbar, the US military reported
on Friday.


One soldier was killed and two were wounded south of Baghdad on
Friday when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb.


Roadside bombs also claimed the lives of a soldier patrolling
predominantly Shiite east Baghdad on Thursday and another as in
the mostly Sunni western half of the turbulent capital city.


Two soldiers were killed during combat operations in the restive
province of Anbar, also on Thursday.


The latest casualties brought the number of US servicemen to die
in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,362, according to an
AFP count based on Pentagon figures.
