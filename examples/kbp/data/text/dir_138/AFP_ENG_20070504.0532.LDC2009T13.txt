An opinion poll released Friday gave right-wing candidate Nicolas
Sarkozy 55 percent of the vote in Sunday's French presidential
election against 45 percent for the Socialist Segolene Royal.


It was the biggest lead yet in a poll for the head of the ruling
Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), who goes into Sunday's vote
as clear favourite.


The IPSOS poll, which was conducted during the day, found that 91
percent of voters are sure of their decision.


Of people who chose the defeated centrist Francois Bayrou in the
first round of the vote, 36 percent said they would vote for
Sarkozy and 35 percent for Royal.
