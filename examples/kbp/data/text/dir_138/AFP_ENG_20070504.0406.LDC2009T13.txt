About 20 diplomats from majority Muslim countries have been
invited to a course on the Catholic Church's politics, the
Pontifical Gregorian University's foundation said Friday.


The course to begin Monday, called "The Catholic Church and the
Holy See's International Politics," will continue until May 27,
first in Rome, then in Turin, foundation president Father Franco
Imoda said.


"It is about making the Holy See's diplomacy more understandable
and providing elements to better understand the Church's
functioning as an international institution," he said.


Imoda said the idea for the course arose before last year's
controversy over Pope Benedict XVI's speech that many interpreted
as linking Islam and violence. The speech triggered widespread
outrage in the Muslim world.


Those invited to the conference are from Algeria, Albania, Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait,
Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria and Turkey.


A diplomat from Montenegro, which has a majority Orthodox
population but a significant number of Muslims, as well, has also
been invited.


The Pontifical Gregorian University, a Roman Catholic institution
based in Rome, was founded in 1551 by St. Ignatius.
