Local favourite Philipp Kohlschreiber reached the semi-finals of
Munich's ATP tournament with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) win over France's
Sebastien Grosjean here on Friday.


The 23-year-old German was avenging his compatriot and top seed
Tommy Haas's defeat at the hands of Grosjean in the first round.


Grosjean was undone by his misfiring first serve, twice losing
his service game in the opening set to go 5-3 behind before
losing it 6-4.


In the second set he was 4-1 down before mounting a fightback
only to lose out in the tiebreak.


Kohlschreiber, who is aiming to become the first German to win
the Munich title since Michael Stich 13 years ago, booked his
last four berth in one hour 30 minutes to set up a meeting with
Marcos Baghdatis.


The number four seed from Cyprus kept his Munich hopes alive
after coming from behind to defeat another German, Alexander
Waske, 2-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.


Tempers flared between the two players when Waske accused
Baghdatis of faking an ankle injury in the second set.


In Friday's other action Russia's third seed Mikhail Youzhny came
through his quarter-final clash against Jurgen Melzer of Austria
6-2, 7-6 (7/5).


Youzhny's path to Sunday's final is being blocked by the Czech
Republic's Tomas Berdych, the number two seed easily accounting
for Frenchman Nicolas Devilder 6-2, 6-0.
