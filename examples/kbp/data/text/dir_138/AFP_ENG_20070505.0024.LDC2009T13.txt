Motorcycling supremo Valentino Rossi roared to pole position in
the Grand Prix of China here Saturday with a record-setting lap
of 1min 58.424 sec on his Yamaha.


It was the seven time world champion's 48th career pole as the
Italian got his 2007 MotoGP championship bid back on track after
a disappointing performance two weeks ago in Turkey where he
finished 10th.


American John Hopkins aboard a Suzuki was second, just 0.891
seconds off the pace, while fellow countryman and Rossi team-mate
Colin Edwards clinched third.


Australian Casey Stoner was fourth and last year's winner Honda
rider Dani Pedrosa will line up fifth for Sunday's race.
