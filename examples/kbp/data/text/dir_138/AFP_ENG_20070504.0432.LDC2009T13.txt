Wigan defender Andy Webster has been ordered to pay 625,000
pounds in compensation to Hearts for breaking his contract with
the Scottish club.


World football bosses FIFA on Friday handed out the punishment
after Webster, who is currently on loan at Rangers, quit Hearts
in the close season and joined Wigan.
