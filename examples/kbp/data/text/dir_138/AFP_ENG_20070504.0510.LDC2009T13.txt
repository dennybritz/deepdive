Senegalese singer Youssou Ndour is planning to mobilise African
artists to draw attention to the crisis in Darfur, the western
Sudanese region ravaged by civil war, his spokesman said Friday.


"Youssou Ndour will take the initiative to mobilise the entire
African artistic community around the Darfur question," Malick
Mbaye was quoted by the APS news agency as saying.


"As an artist and opinion leader", Ndour believes he has "a role
to play for all African peoples, especially those in difficulty",
he said.


Ndour, who is on Time magazine's list of 100 most influential
people, has published 20 albums and collaborated with
international stars including Peter Gabriel, Neneh Cherry and
Axelle Red.
