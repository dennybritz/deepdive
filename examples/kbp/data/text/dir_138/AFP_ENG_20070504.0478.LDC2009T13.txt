Palestinian government minister and Hamas member Bassem Naim was
forced to fly out of Brussels on Friday after Dutch authorities
cancelled his visa, the Belgian interior ministry said.


Naim, the Palestinian sports and youth minister, had planned to
travel on to the Netherlands for a conference on refugees.


Speaking to Arab news channel Al-Jazeera from his plane, he said
he was stopped with a companion by police at Brussels airport,
during a stopover, and told his Netherlands visa had been
revoked.


Interior ministry spokesman Paul Van Tigchelt confirmed to AFP
that the minister was intercepted at Brussels airport at the
request of the Dutch authorities.


"We were informed by the Dutch authorities that the entry visas
were issued in error and that the visas had been annulled," he
said.


Belgian police told him the justice ministry in the Netherlands
had cancelled the visa because he was deemed "dangerous for the
security of the Dutch people", the minister told Al-Jazeera.


Naim left for Brussels from Cairo, according to officials in
Egypt, who said he was expected back in the Egyptian capital on
Friday.


The European Commission has begun dealing with non-Hamas members
in the Palestinian government of national unity, but Hamas is
branded a terrorist group in the EU and United States.


In the West Bank city of Ramallah, information minister Mustafa
Barghouti said: "We are surprised by this decision and we expect
the Netherlands to take a balanced stand between Israel and the
Palestinians."
