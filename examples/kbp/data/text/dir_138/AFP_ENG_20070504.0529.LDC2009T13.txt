Chicago, the US candidate city for the 2016 Olympics, will host
the 2007 World Boxing Championships, the International Boxing
Association (AIBA) and USA Boxing announced Friday.


The first qualifying event for fighters for the 2008 Beijing
Olympics, which Russia dropped after originally planning to host,
will feature more than 600 fighters from 100 nations. It will be
staged October 17 through November 1.


"We're honored to have the opportunity to welcome the greatest
amateur boxers in the world to our country less than one year
before the Beijing Games," US Olympic committee chief executive
Jim Scherr said.


"Boxing has a rich history in our country with legends such as
Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and Sugar Ray Leonard all competing on
the international stage before moving to the professional ranks."


The event was the first major global sports event coming to
Chicago since it was selected last month over Los Angeles as the
US bid candidate against such rivals as Tokyo, Madrid and Rio de
Janeiro.


"We're excited about the opportunity of showcasing our sport in
such an important American city," AIBA president Wu Ching-Kuo
said.
