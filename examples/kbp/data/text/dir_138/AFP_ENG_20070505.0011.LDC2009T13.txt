Gaza militants fired three rockets at southern Israel Saturday
causing no casualties but damaging a building in the town of
Sderot, an army spokesman said.


The rocket fire came a day after Israeli troops shot dead three
militants from the hardline Islamic Jihad group in heavy
exchanges of fire near the northern West Bank town of Jenin.


Islamic Jihad was not party to a November truce under which
Israeli troops pulled out of Gaza in return for a commitment from
militant groups to end rocket fire from the territory.


But it did take part in Egyptian-brokered talks last month aimed
at shoring up the truce after the armed wing of the Hamas
movement of prime minister Ismail Haniya briefly announced it
would no longer respect it.
