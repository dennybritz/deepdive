One of President Gloria Arroyo's fiercest opponents, Jejomar
Binay, was suspended from his post as mayor of the Philippine
business district of Makati amid allegations of corruption, an
official said Saturday.


Interior and local government undersecretary Marius Corpus said
that the 90-day suspension was ordered by the government
ombudsman.


He did not specify why Binay was suspended but Makati City
spokesman Joey Delgado said it was over allegations that Binay
had hundreds of fake employees on the payroll of the city, a
suburb of Manila.


Crowds of supporters mobbed the Makati city hall after the
suspension order was served late Friday but there was no violence
as Binay agreed to pull back his people to avoid clashes with
heavily-armed police.


Earlier this week, a former Makati councillor filed a case with
the ombudsman, accusing Binay of keeping huge amounts of tax
money that should go to the government.


Binay however said the charges and the suspension were just
political harassment by the Arroyo administration and that he
would seek a court injunction to prevent his suspension.


The suspension comes just days before mid-term polls on May 14 in
which Binay is running for re-election against an Arroyo ally,
movie star Lito Lapid.


Binay has long been a critic of Arroyo, allowing the opposition
to hold massive protest rallies in Makati.
