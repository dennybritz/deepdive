Saudi King Abdullah has decided to pardon common law prisoners
but not convicts who pose a danger to state security or who
committed serious crimes, the interior minister announced on
Friday.


Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, quoted by the state news agency SPA,
said the pardon covered "convicts in all the kingdom's prisons
who do not pose a danger to security and are not involved in
major crimes".


The oil-rich kingdom has since May 2003 faced a spate of bombings
and shootings blamed on suspected Al-Qaeda militants, sparking a
relentless security crackdown on Islamist extremists.


Saudi Arabia last week announced it had seized arms and money and
rounded up 172 militants who it said were plotting airborne
attacks on oil facilities and army bases.


King Abdullah will also pay the debts and "blood money" for
prisoners who have insufficient funds of their own, to allow
their reintegration into society, the interior minister said.


But he did not specify how many inmates would be covered by the
pardon.


Saudi Arabia applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law,
which lays down the death penalty for rape, murder, apostasy,
armed robbery and drug trafficking.


But a convict can be pardoned by a murder victim's family on
payment of compensation known as "diya" in the Islamic faith.
