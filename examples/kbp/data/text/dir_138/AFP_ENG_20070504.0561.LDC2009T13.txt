A European heavy rocket placed two large broadcasting satellites
into orbit on Friday, mission control at the European Space
Agency's launch pad here said.


The Ariane-5 ECA rocket took aloft the 4.5 tonne Astra 1L,
providing high- definition TV over Europe for the Luxembourg-
based firm SES Astra, and the 4.1-tonne Galaxy 17, which will
provide TV and communications over North America for Intelsat.


The launch, originally planned for Thursday, had been delayed for
a day due to strong high-altitude winds above the launch site in
French Guiana.


The launch operator was Arianspace, which markets services using
ESA's Ariane rocket.


The launch was the 176th for Ariane and the 32nd involving an
Ariane 5.
