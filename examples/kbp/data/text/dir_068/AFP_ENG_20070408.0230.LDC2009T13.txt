Ship boarding operations in the northern Gulf are vital for Iraqi
security and will continue, despite Iran's seizure of 15 British
mariners, the government here said Sunday.


The Royal Navy suspended boarding operations in the area
following the group's detention after a routine search of a
merchant vessel on March 23, and is undertaking a comprehensive
review of its procedures in the area.


Speaking to BBC radio, Foreign Office minister Lord David
Triesman said the suspension was only temporary, adding: "I think
those waters have got to be kept secure.


"I don't take it that boarding operations will have to cease in
the middle or long term at all."


"The oil platforms have got to be secured, we have got to make
sure that dangerous material is not smuggled into southern Iraq.
I don't think the Iranians should be under any doubt that we
could not allow that to happen."


Triesman gave no indication of when such operations would resume.


The eight Royal Navy sailors and seven Royal Marines were based
on the British warship HMS Cornwall, which is conducting maritime
security patrols as well as helping protect Iraq's oil
infrastructure in the northern Gulf.


He also said the "international stream of pressure was very, very
important indeed" in securing the group's release.
