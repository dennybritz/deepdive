Fresh outbreaks of fighting between Myanmar's ethnic rebels and
armed forces loyal to the country's junta have led to more than
200 ethnic Karen fleeing to Thailand, Thai border officials said
Sunday.


The fighting began Saturday between a pro-junta militia and the
rebel Karen National Union (KNU), forcing the civilians to cross
the border into the western Tak province, said Thawal
Pattanacharoen, regional border police chief.


"The fighting went on all day long until early Sunday morning,
and has forced more than 200 Karen to seek refuge in Thailand,"
Thawal said.


Most of the ethnic minority Karen civilians had now returned
home, he added, with only 60 left in Thailand, most of whom were
women and children.


He denied local media reports that up to 30 rebels from both
sides had died in the fighting, which has pitted Myanmar's pro-
government Democratic Karen Buddhist Army against the KNU.


The KNU is the largest rebel group fighting Myanmar's armed
forces and one of the few remaining ethnic insurgent groups yet
to sign a peace deal with the junta.


Myanmar, under military rule since 1962, has signed ceasefires
with 17 other ethnic armed groups.


Up to 150,000 Karen refugees already live in camps along
Thailand's border with Myanmar. Many of them have been there for
more than 20 years.


Myanmar began a bloody offensive against the Karen a year ago.
Human rights groups say the crackdown has forced thousands of
civilians to abandon their villages and flee into the jungles.
