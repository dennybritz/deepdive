Mariano Gonzalvo, one of the stars of Spanish giants Barcelona in
the 1940s and 50s, has died at the age of 84, the club said on
Sunday.


Gonzalvo, an old style inside right and former Barcelona captain,
played for the club for 14 seasons between 1942 and 1956. He won
five La Liga titles, three Spanish Cups and played for Spain on
16 occasions.


Gonzalvo III, as he was usually known in Spain because two older
brothers were also professional football players, played in five
of Spain's six matches at the 1950 World Cup, including their
famous 1-0 win over England.


In the final round, the only time the World Cup has been decided
by a league system, he played in the 2-2 draw against eventual
winners Uruguay and Spain's 6-1 loss to Brazil.


Spain finished fourth at the 1950 World Cup, their best ever
placing.


Barcelona said that Gonzalvo had died in the Catalan city on
Saturday and he was buried on Sunday at the Las Corts cemetary
which is near the club's Nou Camp football ground.
