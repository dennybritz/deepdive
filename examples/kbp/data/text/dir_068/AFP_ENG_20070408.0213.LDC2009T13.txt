England won the toss and decided to bat in the World Cup Super
Eights match against Australia at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium
here on Sunday.


England recalled Andrew Strauss in place of Ed Joyce with
Australia bringing in batsman Brad Hodge for injured all-rounder
Shane Watson.


England, after their 5-0 Ashes thrashing in Australia, won the
triangular one- day series with a 2-0 win in the final against
world champions.


In all they have won their last three full one-dayers against
Australia but went down to a five-wicket defeat against their
oldest rivals in a World Cup warm-up in St Vincent on March 9.


Australia have won all five of their matches at this tournament
so far as they chase an unprecedented third straight World Cup
title and top the standings in the Super Eights.


England, handicapped by an opening match defeat against New
Zealand, are currently in fifth place.
