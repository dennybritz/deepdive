Tatiana Golovin captured the first WTA Tour title of her career
here Sunday with a confident straight-sets victory over top seed
and defending champion Nadia Petrova.


The eighth-seeded Golovin, ranked 20th in the world, defeated
world No. 7 Petrova 6-2, 6-1 in just 1hr 16min.


The 19-year-old Russian-born French player claimed her first
title after three runner-up finishes - one each in 2004, 2005 and
2006.


An aggressive Golovin opened the match with a service break, and
broke Petrova twice more to serve for the first set at 5-2.


With the first set in her pocket, she made quick work of the
second, as Petrova's frustration mounted.


Golovin converted her second match point, when her opponent fired
a forehand long.


"It's the most beautiful day of my career," said Golovin, whose
progress to the final included a quarter-final victory over five-
time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams and a semi-final triumph
over sixth-seeded Serbian Ana Ivanovic.


"Finally you won one, and I'm really happy for you," Petrova told
her adversary.


In fact, it was Petrova - whose seven career titles include the
Paris Indoors earlier this year - who denied Golovin in her most
recent bid for a title, in the final in Stuttgart last October.


That is the Russian's only victory over Golovin, who has now
beaten her five times. Their last encounter, in the fourth round
at Indian Wells last month, ended when Petrova retired with heat
illness.
