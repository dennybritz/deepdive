Israeli troops shot a Palestinian after he stabbed two soldiers
outside the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the flashpoint West Bank
town of Hebron, wounding one seriously, security and medical
sources said.


"Two soldiers were injured by a Palestinian in Hebron, who was
shot and injured," an army spokesman told AFP, correcting an
earlier army report that the assailant had been killed.


According to the Magen David Adom rescue service, one of the
soldiers was taken to a Jerusalem hospital with serious wounds
after he was stabbed in the back. The other sustained light
wounds.


The 17-year-old Palestinian arrived at a checkpoint near the Tomb
of the Patriarchs -- a site holy to both Jews and Muslims -- when
he drew a knife and stabbed two soldiers, the army said.


He was shot in the leg by an officer standing nearby, and was
evacuated to an Israeli hospital from where he will be taken for
questioning.
