The United Nations Sunday condemned the "senseless" beheading of
an Afghan reporter who had been kidnapped by Taliban last month
with an Italian journalist.


Taliban militants said Sunday that they beheaded Ajmal Naqshbandi
-- whom they captured in southern Helmand province on March 5
with Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo -- after the Afghan
government refused to negotiate his release.


"I have today learnt of the murder of the Afghan journalist Ajmal
Naqshbandi who was abducted by Taliban extremists on March 5 in
Helmand province," Tom Koenigs, UN special envoy to Afghanistan
said in a statement.


"I condemn this senseless murder unreservedly and call on the
authorities to bring those responsible to justice," he said in
the statement issued by the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA).


Taliban claims could not be verified independently but a western
diplomat citing local security sources said under the condition
of anonymity that Naqshbandi was killed.


Mastrogiacomo was freed after some two weeks under an exchange
deal which saw five Taliban prisoners freed from Afghan jails.
The insurgents had demanded the release of some of their jailed
colleagues in order to save Naqshbandi.
