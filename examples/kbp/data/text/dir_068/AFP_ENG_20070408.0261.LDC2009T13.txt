The White House on Sunday denounced the "barbaric" beheading of
an Afghan reporter whom the Taliban kidnapped last month along
with an Italian journalist.


"This barbaric killing reminds us of why the United States and
NATO are in Afghanistan in the first place: To help the good
people of that country defeat the Taliban extremists and their
al-Qaeda allies," said national security spokesman Gordon
Johndroe.


Taliban militants said Sunday that they beheaded Ajmal Naqshbandi
-- whom they captured in southern Helmand province on March 5
with Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo -- after the Afghan
government refused to negotiate his release.


Taliban claims could not be verified independently but a western
diplomat citing local security sources said under the condition
of anonymity that Naqshbandi was killed.


Mastrogiacomo was freed after some two weeks under an exchange
deal which saw five Taliban prisoners freed from Afghan jails.
The insurgents had demanded the release of some of their jailed
colleagues in order to save Naqshbandi.
