The Italian news outlet PeaceReporter said Sunday that it had no
"confirmation" and cast doubt on the reported execution by
Taliban militants of an Afghan reporter who was the interpreter
of an Italian hostage freed last month.


"We have no confirmation through our own channels," PeaceReporter
director Maso Notarianni told AFP. "I advise great prudence. The
announcement of the execution could be a way to exert pressure."


PeaceReporter is linked to the Italian humanitarian group
Emergency, which was the go-between in negotiations for the
release last month of Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo.


Notarianni noted that the Taliban had set an ultimatum of Monday
for executing Ajmal Naqshbandi.


Shohaabuddin Atal, spokesman for top Taliban military commander
Mullah Dadullah, said Naqshbandi was executed Sunday afternoon
because the Afghan authorities refused to negotiate over their
demands for the release of some Taliban militants.


The Italian foreign ministry had no comment.
