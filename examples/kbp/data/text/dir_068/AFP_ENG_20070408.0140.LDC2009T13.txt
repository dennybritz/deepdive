A high-level US delegation led by former UN ambassador Bill
Richardson arrived in North Korea on Sunday, official North and
South Korean media said.


A US military plane landed at a Pyongyang airport, said South
Korea's Yonhap news agency.


"Bill Richardson, governor of New Mexico State, the US, and his
party arrived here Sunday," Pyongyang's Korean Central News
Agency also said.


The trip by the US team -- on a mission to recover the remains of
US soldiers killed in the Korean War -- came days ahead of a key
deadline under a six-party deal to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear
programme.


North Korea has to make good on its pledge to shut down its key
nuclear facility in Yongbyon and allow the return of UN nuclear
inspectors in return for 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil by April
14.


The pledge is part of an aid-for-disarmament deal reached on
February 13 by the United States, China, the two Koreas, Russia
and Japan.


Pyongyang had 60 days from that date to make good on its
promises.


Washington announced Friday that a major obstacle to the six-
party process had likely been overcome, with a mechanism found to
unblock 25 million dollars in frozen North Korean funds.


North Korea has refused to return to the talks or fulfil its
promises under the February deal until the money is returned.
