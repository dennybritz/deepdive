Afghan officials have confirmed that the Taliban militia executed
an Afghan reporter who was abducted with an Italian journalist
last month, an Afghan news agency reported Sunday.


Intelligence services spokesman Saeed Ansari confirmed that the
radical Islamist militia had executed Ajmal Naqshbandi on Sunday,
the private Pajhwok news agency reported.


Ansari also said Rahmatullah Hanefi, the head of the Emergency
non-governmental organisation that brokered Mastrogiacomo's March
19 release, had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the
abduction.


The Taliban earlier Sunday announced they had beheaded Naqshbandi
after the government failed to respond to their demands for the
release of jailed insurgents.


Ansari insisted that Afghan authorities had been trying to
establish contact with the Taliban to secure his release.


Afghan and Italian authorities have been harshly criticised for
their role in the release of Italian journalist Daniele
Mastrogiacomo, snatched on March 4 with Naqshbandi and an Afghan
driver, who was beheaded.


Many were angered that Mastrogiacomo's release was secured
through a secret swap for five Taliban prisoners, but that no
such deal appeared to have been made to free Naqshbandi.
