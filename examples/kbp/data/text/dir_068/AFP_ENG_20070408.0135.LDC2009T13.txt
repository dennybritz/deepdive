A suicide bomber exploded a bomb-filled van near a US-led
military convoy in eastern Afghanistan Sunday, killing no one but
himself, police said.


The attack on a key highway in the eastern province of Nangarhar,
which caused no military casualties, was the second suicide
bombing this week.


"It was a suicide attack targeting a coalition convoy. No one was
hurt," an interior ministry official in the capital Kabul told
AFP, adding that the bomber driving an explosive-filled van was
torn into pieces.


Ghafoor Khan, spokesman for the provincial police department,
also confirmed the bombing and said no one was killed in the
blast in the province's Bati Kot district on a road linking Kabul
to the Pakistani town of Peshawar.


"The only casualty was the bomber himself," the spokesman said.


The US-led military, which has more than 10,000 troops mainly
hunting remnants of the Taliban, had no immediate information
about the incident.


Six people including a policeman were killed in a similar bombing
in Kabul on Friday.


Iraq-style suicide attacks are common in southern and eastern
Afghanistan along the Pakistani border, a rugged region where the
Taliban are most active. Friday's bombing was the third suicide
blast in Kabul since January this year. Afghanistan saw nearly
150 suicide attacks last year which killed hundreds of people,
many of them civilians.
