The second most senior cleric in the Church of England on Sunday
used his Easter sermon to call for the immediate release of a BBC
journalist, who was kidnapped in Gaza nearly one month ago.


"In God's name, please release Alan Johnston. He is not your
enemy," Archbishop of York John Sentamu said at the service at
York Minster, in northern England.


"He is a symbol of ensuring that freedom of the press is not
violated -- an issue Palestinian journalists are too familiar
with after facing routing attacks, harassment and arrests. Let
the man free."


Masked gunmen seized Johnston, 44, as he made his way home from
the BBC's offices in Gaza City on March 12 and has not been heard
from since. No group has claimed responsibility.


A number of Western journalists have been kidnapped in the
increasingly lawless territory but none has been held for so
long.


Johnston was the only Western reporter permanently based in Gaza
and had been preparing to leave because his placement was due to
finish at the end of March.


He joined BBC World Service radio in 1991 and worked in
Uzbekistan and Afghanistan before the Middle East.


Pressure on Palestinian leaders to secure Johnston's release has
mounted in recent days as local journalists staged rallies in the
West Bank and Gaza and declared a three-day reporting boycott on
all government activities.


On Friday, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said he was sure
Johnston was still alive and confident militants would release
him soon.
