Venezuela and Iran Sunday said they strongly backed the formation
of an OPEC- like cartel for the natural gas exporting countries,
saying this would defend their interests.


"We are here to support gas OPEC. Its a very good idea ... Its
very important for (gas) producers to have some agreement,"
Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said Sundy.


"We are here to discuss the issue ... That kind of organisation
has to be prepared," Ramirez said on arrival in Doha to attend a
two-day meeting for the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF)
opening Monday.


Iranian Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri Hamaneh said he believed that
forming a cartel would strengthen the forum.


"We also think that if the forum moves in that direction (forming
a cartel), it will strengthen the forum," the Iranian minister
told reporters.


Hamaneh said other ministers of the forum were "favourable" to
the idea.


Both ministers however said it was still unclear whether the
cartel would be announced during this meeting.


Ramirez also shrugged off opposition from Western nations to such
a cartel.


"Consumer countries are always against our interests. We are
trying to defend our interests," he said.


Egyptian Energy Minister Sameh Fahmi earlier told reporters his
country opposed the formation of a gas cartel, saying the world
is not prepared for the formation of a new energy organisation.


GCEF, a loose grouping of gas producers and exporters, was
founded in 2001 and has 15 members, including Russia, Iran and
Qatar, the world's top gas countries in terms of reserves.
