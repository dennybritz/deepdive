Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"There have always been criticisms about Lara. I don't know what
people expect of him. I don't know if the people expect him to
hold their (the players) hands and to take them away and make
them perform."


- Sir Garry Sobers defends under-fire Brian Lara as West Indies
face a make-or- break World Cup week.


"We are now on top of the world."


- Bangladeshi fan Waji Ullah gets carried away with his team's
win over South Africa.


"It's difficult to come up with answers after the Bangladesh
defeat. We didn't do the basics well and gave them an
opportunity. They grabbed it with both hands."


- South Africa captain Graeme Smith mystified by the shock 67-run
loss to Bangladesh.


"Leading this current team is different. This is a very skilled
side and we have come here with a fair idea of what is needed and
we are very confident of winning."


- New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming on the difference between
the 2007 team and the 1999 and 2003 sides he led.


"I'm obviously looking forward to playing in front of a few more
fans."


- Australia skipper Ricky Ponting on the organisers' decision to
allow fans to bring musical instruments into the grounds and to
end re-entry restrictions.
