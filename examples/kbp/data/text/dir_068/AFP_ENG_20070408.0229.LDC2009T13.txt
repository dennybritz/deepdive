England were 39-2 after 10 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against Australia at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium here
on Sunday.


Ian Bell was on 16 and Kevin Pietersen was on four.


Skipper Michael Vaughan failed again being clean bowled by Shaun
Tait for just five with the score on 10 in the fourth over.


Tait also bowled Andrew Strauss, recalled in place of Ed Joyce,
for seven in the sixth over with the total on 24.


Australia have won all five of their matches at this tournament
so far as they chase an unprecedented third straight World Cup
title and top the standings in the Super Eights.


England, handicapped by an opening match defeat against New
Zealand, are currently in fifth place and lost to Sri Lanka last
time out.
