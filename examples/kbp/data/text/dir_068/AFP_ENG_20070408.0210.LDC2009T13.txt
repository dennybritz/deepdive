One of the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's regime still
on the run surfaced in a video recording broadcast by the Al-
Jazeera news channel on Sunday.


The Qatar-based network gave no date for the footage showing
elite Republican Guards chief Saifeddin Fulayh Hassan Taha al-
Rawi, who was number 14 on the most wanted list drawn up by the
US military for the 2003 invasion.


Rawi, who carries a one million dollar US bounty on his head, was
also jack of spades on the "deck of cards" of 55 most wanted
supects distributed by the Pentagon at the outset of the
invasion.


In the footage shown, Rawi accused US forces of using neutron and
phosphorus bombs during their assault on Baghdad airport ahead of
the capture of the Iraqi capital.


The channel said that the clip was an excerpt from a longer
interview, more of which it would air later.
