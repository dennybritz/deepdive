Months after announcing he would not make a second run for US
president, the defeated 2004 candidate John Kerry on Sunday
pressed a different campaign: to protect Americans from harmful
pollution.


"This is about moms and pops in North Carolina and Mississippi,
and places where people may be breathing bad air, or getting sick
from wells that are polluted, or losing their fish in their
lakes," Kerry said on ABC News.


"This is the most compelling issue that I've seen other than
war... in all the time I've been in public life."


The Massachusetts Democratic senator and his wife Teresa Heinz
Kerry used the interview to promote a book they have jointly
written, "This Moment on Earth," which highlights cases of the
harmful effects of pollution.


Kerry said his decision not to run for president in 2008 allowed
him to speak the truth on environmental issues.


"Now I have a chance to talk about these things and people know
it's coming from my heart and my gut, not from a political
strategist," he said.


Kerry campaigned in 2004 with a liberal stance on social issues,
but lost to Republican President George W. Bush.


The 2000 Democratic presidential candidate, ex-vice president Al
Gore, has also led a high-profile environmental campaign with his
feature film "An Inconvenient Truth," about the climate effects
of global warming.
