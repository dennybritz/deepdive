Australia were 201-2 after 40 overs in their World Cup Super
Eights match against England at the Sir Vivian Richard Stadium on
Sunday chasing 248 to win.


Skipper Ricky Ponting was on 86 with Michael Clarke on 40.


Adam Gilchrist, who put on 57 for the first wicket with Matthew
Hayden, was the first man out caught by Paul Collingwood off
Andrew Flintoff for 27 in the 11th over.


Hayden was bowled by Collingwood for 41 in the 20th over with the
score on 89.


Earlier, Kevin Pietersen hit 104 and Ian Bell made 77 after
England skipper Michael Vaughan had won the toss and elected to
bat.


Defending champions Australia have won all of their matches at
the World Cup and a victory here Sunday will virtually guarantee
a semi-final place.


Although England didn't have to win to keep their semi-final
hopes alive, defeat would lead them needing to win all three of
their remaining Super Eights matches against Bangladesh, South
Africa and the West Indies while hoping other results went their
way.
