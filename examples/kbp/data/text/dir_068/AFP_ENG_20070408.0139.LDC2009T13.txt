A high-level US delegation led by New Mexico Governor and former
UN ambassador Bill Richardson arrived in North Korea Sunday,
South Korea's Yonhap news agency said.


A US military plane landed at a Pyongyang airport, said Yonhap,
South Korea's sole monitor of North Korean official media.


The trip by the US team, on a mission to recover the remains of
US soldiers killed in the Korean War, came days ahead of a key
deadline under a six-party deal to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear
programme.
