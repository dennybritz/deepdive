The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
warned on Sunday of discrimination of Roma in Bosnia, urging
local authorities to improve the group's social status.


The Roma, who are Bosnia's largest minority, are "often denied
their basic rights and discriminated against," the OSCE said in a
statement, issued on the International Roma Day.


The community, which mainly lives in poverty here, "encounters
obstacles in access to health care, education, employment, and
adequate housing," the statement added.


The pan-European body urged the Bosnian government to adopt a
national strategy on Roma aimed at improving their social status.


Bosnian officials estimate that about 50,000 of the country's 3.8
million inhabitants are Roma.
