Onetime Iraqi information minister Saad Kassem Hammudi, one of
the leading Shiites in Saddam Hussein's Sunni Arab-dominated
regime, has died in exile in Damascus, official media said on
Sunday.


He died of a heart attack on Saturday and was buried on Sunday in
the Najha cemetery south of the Syrian capital, the official SANA
news agency said.


Scion of a family of Shiite clerics, Hammudi was a founding
member of Saddam's now disbanded Baath party, joining it before
the growing domination of Sunnis loyal to the now executed
strongman overshadowed the party's secular, non- sectarian
ideology.


Hammmudi edited the state daily Al-Jumhuriya before being
appointed information minister in 1977.


On the eve of the US-led invasion of 2003, he served as chairman
of the foreign and Arab affairs committee of the Iraqi
parliament.


At a conference in Damascus the previous December to show
solidarity with Saddam's regime in the face of US war
preparations, Hammudi warned: "If the United States invades Iraq,
we will fight back in a way that will win admiration."
