Sri Lankan stepped up security Sunday over fears of bomb attacks
ahead of the traditional New Year festivities this week while the
military said six rebels and a soldier were killed in fresh
fighting.


A government soldier was killed in a confrontation with Tamil
Tiger rebels in the north of the island Saturday, the military
said in a statement. It said three guerrillas were also killed.


In a similar skirmish in the eastern district of Batticaloa,
three Tiger rebels were shot dead and their bodies were captured
by the security forces, the military said in a statement.


The latest clashes came hours after suspected Tiger rebels set
off a powerful roadside bomb against a civilian bus in the
island's north Saturday, killing eight people and wounding 25.


Sniffer dogs were deployed at main bus stations Sunday to guard
against explosives being planted following a separate parcel bomb
attack last week aboard a bus in which 17 people were killed and
25 wounded in the eastern district of Ampara.


The blasts come ahead of the April 14 New Year celebrations
marked by the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils.


The government blamed both blasts on the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who denied any involvement and in turn accused
the military of staging the attacks to "discredit" them.


Tamil Tigers have waged a 35-year campaign for independence that
has claimed more than 60,000 lives in Sri Lanka.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
