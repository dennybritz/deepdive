A vehicle curfew has been declared for 24 hours starting on
Monday at 5 am (0100 GMT) as Iraq marks the fourth anniversary of
the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, state television reported.


"All vehicles including motorcycles will be banned from 5 am on
Monday to 5 am the next day," Brigadier General Qassim Atta
Mussawi told Al-Iraqiya state television on Sunday.


The daily night-time pedestrian and vehicle curfew between 10 pm
and 5 am will also remain in force on Sunday.
