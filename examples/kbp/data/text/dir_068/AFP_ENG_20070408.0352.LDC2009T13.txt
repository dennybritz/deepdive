South Africa suffered another blow to their morale on Sunday when
they lost their world number one ranking following their shock
67-run defeat to Bangladesh.


The defeat means also that Ricky Ponting's Australia will regain
their place at the top of the new rankings when the official
figures are released later this week.


According to the International Cricket Council (ICC) one-day
international predictor, South Africa lost one point after their
defeat against Bangladesh and have now moved down to 125, while
Australia moved on to 127.


Even a defeat in their latest Super Eights match against England
on Sunday would not displace Australia from the top as they will
still go to 126.


In case they register a win over their arch rivals they will
strengthen their position with one more point (128), the
predictor said.


South Africa topped the ICC one-day international rankings at its
annual cut-off date on April 1, 2007 for the first time since the
rankings were introduced five years ago.


That earned them a handsome cash award of 175,000 US dollars,
while Australia pocketed 75,000 US dollars for being runner-up.


South Africa's promotion to the top spot was a reward for their
good showing in one-day internationals over the past 12 months.


Their performances included a 3-2 series win over Australia on
their own soil, during which they clinched the series by chasing
a world-record 438-9 last year.


South Africa also reached the semi-finals of the ICC Champions
Trophy in India in October 2006, before winning 4-0 against India
and 3-1 against Pakistan, both at home.
