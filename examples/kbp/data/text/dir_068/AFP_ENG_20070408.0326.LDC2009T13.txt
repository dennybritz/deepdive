Sweden's Markus Rosenberg scored the winner in second-placed
Werder Bremen's 1-0 home victory over Nuremberg on Sunday to
close the gap on German league leaders Schalke 04 to just two
points.


Rosenberg scored with a quarter-hour to go for the northern club
which is proving to be Schalke's main rival for the title with
six matches left.


Werder laboured to their victory without panache as they kept on
failing to get past Nuremberg's solid defence till Rosenberg
managed to find a way.


"It was a tough game just as we expected," said Werder coach
Thomas Schaaf after the match.


Werder's star striker Miroslav Klose has now not scored in their
last nine Bundesliga matches though the team, which is not in the
same top form as during the autumn, has managed to do enough to
stay in the running for the championship.


Schalke lead with 56 points from their 28 matches after their 2-0
home win against tailenders Borussia Monchengladback on Saturday.


Werder Bremen have 54 points, followed by VfB Stuttgart, on 52
after their 4-2 win over Hamburg, with reigning champions Bayern
Munich, who won 2-1 at Hanover on Saturday, six points off the
pace.


In Sunday's other fixture, mid-table VfL Bochum won 4-1 at fifth-
placed Bayern Leverkusen to jump five places to 11th.
