A German zoo broke the record Sunday for the world's largest
Easter egg tree, decorating an oak with more than 75,000 eggs,
organisers said.


The painted eggs donated by some 200 people, as well as by
nurseries and schools, were hung on an American Red Oak tree
before more than 3,000 spectators at the zoo in Rostock in
northeastern Germany.


The 76,600 eggs are to remain in place until June 1, which had
been "Children's Day" in the former East Germany.


The previous record of 20,030 eggs had been held by another
eastern city, Dresden, since 2004.


Rostock zoo officials plan to apply for a mention in the Guiness
Book of World Records in the coming days.
