Portuguese runner Fernando Silva has been handed a two-year ban
for using EPO (erythropoietin), according to the Portuguese
athletics federation (FPA).


Silva has been told he must hand back his silver medal from the
European Cross Country Championships, which he won in December,
after tests showed he had tested positive for the banned blood
booster.


All of Silva's results from December 4 will also be annulled,
added the FPA.


Silva tested positive for EPO in December. A second 'B' sample
tested positive for the drug at a Madrid laboratory on February
5.


The 27-year-old has admitted his guilt and will now serve a two-
year ban effective from January 18, 2007.


EPO, a hormone which can be produced naturally by the body, is
also used in its synthetic form to aid endurance by boosting the
oxygen-rich red blood cells in the blood.
