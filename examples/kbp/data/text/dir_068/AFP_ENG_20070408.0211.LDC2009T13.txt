A powerful blast killed at least one person in the northeastern
city of Guwahati on Sunday just as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh arrived here to attend a function, police said.


Twelve others were injured in the explosion that occurred at a
crowded railway crossing in Guwahati, the largest city in the
insurgency-racked Assam state, a police spokesman said.


He said the blast occurred 10 kilometres (six miles) away from a
site where Singh was scheduled to lay the foundation of a new
bridge.


Senior police officer Rajan Singh blamed the attack on the
region's outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA)
guerrilla group, which has been campaigning for decades for
greater autonomy in Assam state.


Singh said a powerful bomb concealed in a parked motorcycle went
off at the rail crossing in Guwahati city.


"Preliminary reports suggest that one person has died in the
blast and a dozen more are injured," officer Singh said.


Three of the victims were taken to hospital in a critical
condition, he said.


During January, suspected ULFA rebels killed 73 people, 61 of
them Hindi- speaking migrant workers in Assam.


At least 10,000 people have died in fighting between government
forces and separatists in Assam in the past two decades.
