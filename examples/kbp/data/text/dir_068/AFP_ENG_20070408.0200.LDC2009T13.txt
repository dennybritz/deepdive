A 15-year-old girl in Cairo has been diagnosed with bird flu, the
34th person in Egypt to be infected with the disease, the health
ministry said on Sunday.


Marina Kamil Mikhail, from Cairo's Shubra district, was admitted
to hospital on Thursday with high fever, health ministry
spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahin told AFP.


The girl, who had been in contact with domestic poultry, was
treated with Tamiflu, he said, adding that the rest of her family
is being tested for the disease.


Egypt's position on major bird migration routes and the
widespread practice of keeping domestic fowl close to living
quarters have given the Arab world's most populous nation the
highest human death toll from avian flu outside Asia.


So far, the virus has killed 13 people in the country.


Women and children have borne the brunt of the virus due to their
role in taking care of domestic fowl. The government says it is
conducting a vigorous campaign to combat the spread of the virus
through vaccinations and raising awareness, but cases continue to
appear.
