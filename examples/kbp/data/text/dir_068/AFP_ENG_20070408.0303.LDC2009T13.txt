US President George W. Bush marked Easter Sunday by attending
church at a Texas military base and said he had prayed for peace
and for the safety of US troops.


"I had a chance to reflect on the great sacrifice that our
military and their families are making. I prayed for their
safety, I prayed for their strength and comfort, and I pray for
peace," he said at Fort Hood.


"This is a joyous day for many people around the world, and it's
a day for us to reflect on the many blessings in our lives. And
we thank the general and the preacher at Fort Hood for welcoming
me and Laura, and Mother and Dad and my Mother-in-Law. We wish
all Americans a peaceful weekend. We wish our troops all the very
best," said Bush.


The president has been on his Texas ranch since Wednesday. He
returns to Washington on Monday after a stop in Yuma, Arizona to
highlight his immigration overhaul proposal.
