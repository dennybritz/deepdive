ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed insisted on Sunday that the
governing body had been right to stand by Bangladesh when many
feared the Asian side were out of their depth.


Speed praised the progress made by Bangladesh who have defeated
India and South Africa at this World Cup.


"We've been criticised for many years for including Bangladesh at
the top table of world cricket. What they've done in the last
couple of weeks is to justify their existence here," said the ICC
chief.


Ireland, a non-Test nation, also beat Pakistan in the group phase
- a result that effectively knocked the 1992 champions out of the
tournament and Speed added: "I've said on many occasions that the
commercial powerhouse for cricket is India and Pakistan.


"India and Pakistan haven't made it through to the final eight
here. If we go back to the 1999 World Cup (hosts) England didn't
make it through to the final six and in 2003 (hosts) South
Africa, West Indies, Pakistan and England all failed to make the
last six.


"These things happen. From a commercial perspective there are
some negatives there but if you lose matches you go home."
