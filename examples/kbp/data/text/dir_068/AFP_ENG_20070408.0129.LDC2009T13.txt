Pope Benedict XVI lamented in his Easter blessing Sunday that
"nothing positive comes from Iraq."


The country is "torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil
population flees," the pope said in his traditional "Urbi et
Orbi" (to the city and the world) blessing from the loggia of St
Peter's Basilica.


The pope speaks rarely about the situation in Iraq, where attacks
continue in and around Baghdad despite a massive security
operation since February 14 to quell daily bloodshed in the Iraqi
capital that has left thousands dead in the last year alone.
