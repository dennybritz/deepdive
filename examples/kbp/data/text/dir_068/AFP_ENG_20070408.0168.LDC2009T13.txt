Thai prosecutors will bring corruption charges against deposed
premier Thaksin Shinawatra within two months, his army-appointed
successor said in remarks broadcast Sunday.


Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, in an interview taped during a
visit to Tokyo last week, repeated that Thaksin had the right to
return to the kingdom but would face charges.


"I think it should be done in one or two months from now, no
later than that," Surayud tld Japanese public broadcaster NHK on
being asked when the indictment would be finished.


Surayud said last week during a press conference here that
Thaksin may be charged by the end of April and voiced confidence
that prosecutors would "pin him down."


Thailand's army cited alleged corruption by Thaksin, a self-made
billionaire, as the main reason to oust him in September.


Investigators have charged Thaksin's wife and threatened his
children but have yet to charge the former prime minister
himself, who has been travelling around Asia since the coup.
