Croatian international forward Ivan Klasnic said Sunday he was
optimistic of returning to action with his club Werder Bremen
after recently undergoing a second kidney transplant.


"I'm optimistic I will return to playing. For the moment
everything is going fine, and I'm happy. The doctors are also
happy," Klasnic said after his team's 1-0 Bundesliga victory over
Nuremberg Sunday.


Klasnic, 27, underwent a second kidney transplant in mid-March
after a first kidney transplant in January failed.


On Sunday Klasnic walked across the pitch before kick-off
brandishing a banner on which he wrote a message to thank the
club and its supporters for "believing in me".


Even before he had undergone his first transplant, the German
club announced they would add a year on to his contract, which
was supposed to expire at the end of this season.


The Croat has played at Werder Bremen since 2001, scoring 42
goals in a total of 135 matches.
