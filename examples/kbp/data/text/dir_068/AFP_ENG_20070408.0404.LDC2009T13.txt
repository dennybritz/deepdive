Unknown gunmen murdered a police commander as his wife and
children looked on, officials said Sunday, during a wave of 14
murders in Guerrero, Mexico.


Police commander Ernesto Moreno was dining Saturday in
Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero state, when two men jumped
out of a car and opened fire on Moreno in front of his wife and
two children, the police force director said.


Moreno's death was one of a wave of 14 murders over the past 10
days in Guerrero, where drug traffickers of the so-called Gulf
and Sinaloa cartels are vying for control.


"We have a wave of violence that is affecting Zihuatanejo and
Acapulco," both towns in Guerrero, state government spokesman
Armando Chavarria said.


On Friday, a 15-year correspondent of Mexico's largest television
network, Televisa, was murdered by an unknown gunman who shot him
three times as he left an Acapulco radio station where he hosted
a program.


Amado "Ramirez's death must be taken seriously by the
authorities," Reporters Without Borders said in a statement.


Mexico, with 10 journalist deaths in 2006, was the second-most
dangerous country for media workers, surpassed only by Iraq.


Mexico has deployed more than 20,000 soldiers and federal police
to Guerrero and elsewhere to fight drug violence, with little
success.


Official statistics show that in 2006 the number of "executions"
linked to drug trafficking topped 4,000. Most of those so
murdered were drug runners and law enforcement officers.
