England were 196-5 after 40 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against Australia at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium here
on Sunday.


Kevin Pietersen was on 75 with Ravi Bopara on 10.


Skipper Michael Vaughan failed again being clean bowled by Shaun
Tait for just five with the score on 10 in the fourth over.


Tait also bowled Andrew Strauss, recalled in place of Ed Joyce,
for seven in the sixth over with the total on 24.


Ian Bell, who put on 140 with Pietersen for the third wicket,
went for 77, caught by Michael Hussey at extra cover off Glenn
McGrath in the 30th over with the score on 164.


Paul Collingwood was dismissed six balls later for two, caught by
Adam Gilchrist off Tait with the score on 167.


Andrew Flintoff was the fifth man out when he was stumped by
Gilchrist off Brad Hogg having made only four with the total on
179 in the 36th over.


Australia have won all five of their matches at this tournament
so far as they chase an unprecedented third straight World Cup
title and top the standings in the Super Eights.


England, handicapped by an opening match defeat against New
Zealand, are currently in fifth place and lost to Sri Lanka last
time out.
