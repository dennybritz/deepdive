Former Tour de France champion Jan Ullrich insisted Sunday that
he is above reproach despite blood bags seized in a Spanish
doping scandal being proven to be his by German prosecutors.


DNA tests on blood seized in the offices of Spanish doctor
Eufemiano Fuentes last year have proven that the samples are
Ullrich's, say Bonn prosecutors, who are investigating the rider
for possible fraud.


And speaking for the first time since the revelations, the 1997
Tour de France winner said in a letter addressed to his fans on
his website: "These latest findings change strictly nothing of
the fact that I'm blameless.


"I've never lied to anyone thoughout my career nor used anyone so
I can't admit to an error that I have not made. I fear no
procedure, no prosecutor, or federation.


"For me as well there are still a lot of questions which remain
unanswered and until everything is cleared up I'm no longer going
to comment publicly on this case."


Ullrich added that he would give his own version of the facts at
the right time.


"Of course it's not an easy time because the situation is out of
the control of me, my friends and family. Life is a battle which
I'm ready to wage," he added.


Ullrich retired from cycling in February, 10 months after his
name surfaced in Operation Puerto, leading to the German being
excluded from last year's Tour de France race and sacked by
T-Mobile.
