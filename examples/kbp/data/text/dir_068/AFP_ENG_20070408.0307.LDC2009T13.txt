Newcastle ensured their Premiership survival on Sunday with a
hard-fought 16-7 win over Northampton at Kingston Park.


A tremendous defensive display from the Falcons ensured the
visitors left the north-east without a bonus point despite the
Saints dominating possession in front of a 10,200 sell-out crowd.


An early Toby Flood try, in addition to three penalties and a
conversion from Jonny Wilkinson, negated a Christian Labit score
for Saints.


Wasps, meanwhile, kept their championship title hopes alive when
they snatched a 27-26 victory over Saracens thanks to a dramatic
Mark Van Gisbergen conversion deep into injury time.


Wasps trailed 26-13 with 10 minutes remaining, but Eoin Reddan,
scorer of two tries in last weekend's European Cup victory over
Leinster, grabbed two more in a do-or-die finish.


Van Gisbergen came off the bench to convert both, the second from
the left-hand touchline three minutes into injury time.


Danny Cipriani scored the other try for Wasps, with Dave Walder
kicking three goals, while Saracens responded with tries from
Thomas Castaignede, Cencus Johnston and Rodd Penney, and four
goals from the boot of Glen Jackson.
