Taliban militants killed Sunday an Afghan reporter kidnapped last
month with an Italian journalist, after the government refused to
negotiate his release, a militant spokesman said.


"We killed Ajmal (Naqshbandi) today at 1505 (1135 GMT) because
the government did not respond to our demands, said Shohaabuddin
Atal, spokesman for top Taliban military commander Mullah
Dadullah.


"They (the government) did not contact us," he told AFP.
