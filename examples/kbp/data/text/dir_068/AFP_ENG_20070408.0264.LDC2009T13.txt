The Italian government was trying to confirm reports on Sunday of
the execution of an Afghan reporter who worked as an interpreter
for a correspondent of the daily La Repubblica, the prime
minister's spokesman said.


"At the moment they (the reports) have not been confirmed. We are
in contact with our embassy in Kabul and with the crisis unit at
the foreign ministry," Silvio Sircana told the ANSA news agency.


"Our sources have given us no confirmation," he added. "We are
waiting for confirmation. The government can say no more right
now. We first need to know what happened," Sircana said.


Shohaabuddin Atal, spokesman for top Taliban military commander
Mullah Dadullah, claimed that Ajmal Naqshbandi was executed
Sunday afternoon because the Afghan authorities refused to
negotiate over their demands for the release of two Taliban
militants.


Naqshbandi was kidnapped along with La Repubblica correspondent
Daniele Mastrogiacomo on March 4 in southern Afghanistan. The
Italian was released two weeks later in exchange for the freedom
of five Taliban fighters, but his Afghan driver was beheaded.
