German second division club 1860 Munich have come up with a novel
way of raising funds to strengthen their playing squad.


The club that lives perpetually in the shadow of its neighbours
Bayern Munich, is asking fans to buy club scarves for 50 euros so
they will be able to afford new players in the close season.


"We desperately need some money," said general manager Stefan
Ziffner, who hopes to raise a million euros. "We don't have any
other choice, we have to stick together."


In return for their 50 euros, fans will receive a scarf inscribed
with the words: "For the future of the Lions."


Half the money raised will go to buying new players while the
rest will be used to balance the books, the club said.


1860 were the major club in their city until the late 1960s and
they were champions in 1966. Bayern helped out their neighbours
last season by lending 1860 11 million euros.
