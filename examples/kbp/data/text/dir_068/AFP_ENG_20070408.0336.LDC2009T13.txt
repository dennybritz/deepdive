Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservatives have made
gains over their Liberal Party rivals but still would not have
enough support to form a majority government, suggested a poll
published Sunday.


If an election were to take place today, Conservatives would take
36 percent of votes while Liberals would get 33 percent,
according to findings published by the SES Research Institute.


The poll surveyed 913 Canadians between March 31 and April 5 with
a margin of error of 3.3 percent.


A poll by another research group in February had similar
findings, making it unlikely that Harper would call an early
election since his minority Conservatives would not be strong
enough at the ballot box to gain a majority.


Harper brushed aside speculation last month that, emboldened by
the unexpected rise of conservatives in Quebec and strong
national polling, he could soon trigger a federal election.


The SES poll noted that the Liberal Party had seen a nine percent
drop in support among those polled in Quebec, following the
release of Harper's budget in March that is favorable to Quebec
and a revived probe into a 2006 financial scandal that derailed
the party.


Liberal federalists narrowly won French-speaking Quebec's
election last month, dashing separatists' hopes by taking 48
seats in Quebec's 125-seat National Assembly.
