A powerful blast killed at least one person in the northeastern
city of Guwahati on Sunday just as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh arrived here to attend a function, police said.


Twelve others were injured in the explosion that occurred at a
crowded railway crossing in Guwahati, the largest city in the
insurgency-racked Assam state, a police spokesman said.


He said the blast occurred 10 kilometres (six miles) away from a
site where Singh was scheduled to lay the foundation of a new
bridge.


Senior police officer Rajan Singh blamed the attack on the
region's outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom guerrilla
group, which has been campaigning for decades for greater
autonomy in Assam state.
