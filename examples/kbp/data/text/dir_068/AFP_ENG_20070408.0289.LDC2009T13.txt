Six NATO-led soldiers died from injuries sustained Sunday in a
mine explosion in southern Afghanistan, the alliance force said
in a statement.


"Six ISAF soldiers died today in Southern Afghanistan as a result
of injuries sustained when the vehicle they were traveling in hit
an explosive device," the International Security Assistance Force
said in a statement.


The latest casualties brought to seven the number of ISAF
soldiers killed on Sunday.


One ISAF soldier was killed and two others were wounded in a
separate but similar blast in southern Afghanistan Sunday
morning.


The ISAF, in line with to its policies, would not provide
information on the exact location of the incidents or reveal the
nationalities of the dead soldiers, leaving it to relevant
national authorities to do so.


An ISAF vehicle was also damaged in the second blast, the
statement said.


It did not say who might have planted the device but similar
bombings in the past have been blamed on the Taliban militants
who have been waging an insurgency against government and foreign
troops.


The insurgency launched months after the ouster of the Taliban by
a US-led invasion in late 2001 was intensified last year.
