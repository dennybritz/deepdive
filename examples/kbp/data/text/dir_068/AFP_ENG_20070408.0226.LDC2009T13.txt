The body of a murdered South African national was found in a
plastic bag on the outskirts of the northwestern Pakistani city
of Peshawar on Sunday, police said.


The body of the 26-year-old man was found in the plastic bag --
of a type normally used for farming -- in Peshawar's Baboo Garhi
suburbs, local police investigator Kachkol Khan told AFP.


According to the passport found in his pocket the man was
identified as Kenneth Scott Andrew, a resident of Durban, Khan
said, adding that he had entered Peshawar on January 1 this year
on tourist visa.


Police are now treating the case as murder, Khan said.


Doctors who carried out the post mortem on the body said that the
man had no firearm injury or knife wounds and they suspected that
he had been given some poisonous material.


"We have taken the samples and sent to the forensic lab in
Lahore. It appears that he vomited blood before his death," a
doctor who conducted the autopsy told AFP.
