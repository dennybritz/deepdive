Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Sunday "strongly"
condemned the reported execution of an Afghan journalist at the
hands of the Taliban militia, the ANSA news agency reported.


"I learned with anguish the news of the murder of the interpreter
that followed that of the (correspondent's) driver," Prodi told
reporters, adding: "We strongly condemn this absurd crime."


The Taliban earlier claimed that the freelance reporter, Ajmal
Naqshbandi, was executed Sunday afternoon because the Afghan
authorities refused to negotiate over their demands for the
release of two Taliban militants.


Naqshbandi served as the interpreter of La Repubblica
correspondent Daniele Mastrogiacomo, who was held captive for two
weeks last month and whose Afghan driver who was beheaded.
