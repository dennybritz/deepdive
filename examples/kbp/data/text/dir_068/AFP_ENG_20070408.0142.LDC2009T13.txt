Manly joined North Queensland and Melbourne as the only unbeaten
teams in Australia's National Rugby League after a tight 13-10
win over New Zealand Warriors at Brookvale Oval Sunday.


The Sea Eagles overcame a 6-0 halftime deficit to beat the
Warriors for the first time since 1996 and remain unbeaten after
four matches this season.


Fullback Brett Stewart, who scored one try but had two others
disallowed, proved a headache for the tiring Warriors' defence
with his menacing runs.


Scrum-half Michael Monaghan sealed the win for Manly with a
30-metre drop goal in the 72nd minute.


The Warriors rallied but a 78th minute try to backrower Simon
Mannering proved too little too late as the visitors had just 50
seconds to find another try to steal the game.


Fullback Preston Campbell scored one try, made another and flew
high to save one in helping competition newcomers Gold Coast
withstand a last-ditch Penrith Panthers fightback for a 24-22
win.


Former Panther Campbell, who also kicked four goals for the
Titans, was on hand to help the newcomers to a 12-0 lead after 15
minutes, pouncing on an error by opposite number Rhys Wesser to
score adjacent to the posts.


In the second half, he set up a try for Scott Prince with a neat
44th minute grubber kick that took Gold Coast out to 18-6.
