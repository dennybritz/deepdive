Australia is considering handing over command of international
troops in East Timor to the United Nations after mid-year
elections, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Sunday.


Australia has about 1,000 troops in the impoverished nation, most
of whom were sent there last year following violence between the
East Timor government and rebel forces.


The international force also includes about 200 troops and police
from New Zealand.


Downer, speaking on the eve of Monday's presidential elections in
the tiny country, said Australia continued to take the security
situation in East Timor "month by month".


"The troops will absolutely be there until after the end of the
legislative elections in July," he told Australian Associated
Press.


"Once the legislative elections are out of the way, we'll have a
look at the situation, not only in terms of the international
task force there led by Australia, but in terms of whether we
might move to some sort of United Nations- based military
presence rather than Australian."


Downer said security in East Timor appeared to be under control
ahead of the presidential polls.


"We are, obviously, concerned that in the election period there
could be a good deal of tension and politically motivated
violence but the last I heard the situation was okay," he said.


Downer said it was unlikely a single presidential candidate would
win an outright majority in the election to replace Xanana Gusmao
and that a second round of voting was expected.
