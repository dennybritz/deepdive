The Al-Jazeera news channel broadcast a video recording Sunday of
what it said was one of the most wanted members of Saddam
Hussein's regime still on the run.


The Qatar-based network gave no date for the purported footage of
elite Republican Guards chief Saifeddin Fulayh Hassan Taha al-
Rawi, who was number 14 on the most wanted list drawn up by the
US military for the 2003 invasion.


Rawi, who carries a one million dollar US bounty on his head, was
also jack of spades on the "deck of cards" of 55 most wanted
supects distributed by the Pentagon at the outset of the
invasion.


In the footage shown, Rawi accuses US forces of using neutron and
phosphorus bombs during their assault on Baghdad airport ahead of
the capture of the Iraqi capital.


His face is difficult to identify due to low light, but he is
seen sitting in what appears to be a living room wearing a black
and white kefiya, the traditional Arab headdress.


"The enemy used neutron and phosporus weapons against Baghdad
airport... there were bodies burnt to their bones," he says,
adding that elite Iraqi soldiers "fought until they were
martyred."


The channel said that the clip was an excerpt from a longer
interview, more of which it would air later.
