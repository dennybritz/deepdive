Iraq's radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on Sunday urged his
militiamen and security forces to end their three-day-long fight
in Diwaniyah, saying it was a "trap" by US-led forces.


"He (Sadr) appeals to the Iraqi army and the Mahdi militia not to
fall into America's trap by fighting in Diwaniyah," said a
statement stamped and issued by the cleric's office in the holy
city of Najaf.


US and Iraqi soldiers have clashed with Shiite militiamen,
including from Sadr's Mahdi Army, in the central city of
Diwaniyah since Friday.


Calling for unity against US troops, Sadr urged local forces not
to support the "occupier because it is your enemy."


Accusing the US authorities of sowing dissent between the Iraqis,
the statement said the foreign forces planned to divide the
people in Diwaniyah.


"Iraq has had enough bloodshed. The occupation forces led by the
biggest evil, America, is working to sow dissent either directly
or through its agents," said the statement.


Sadr, whom the US military believes is in self-exile in Iran, led
two bloody rebellions against US forces in 2004 before entering
the political process.


He calls repeatedly for foreign troops to leave Iraq, while his
militia is accused by the US military of launching attacks on
minority Sunni Arabs.


His office insists that Sadr is in Iraq. The cleric has not been
seen in Iran nor in Iraq since before a major Iraqi-US security
crackdown began in Baghdad on February 14.
