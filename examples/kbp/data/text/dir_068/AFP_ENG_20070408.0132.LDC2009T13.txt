Hong Kong's political leader Donald Tsang was to fly to Beijing
Sunday to be officially inaugurated for a second term as the
city's chief executive.


Tsang will be handed the so-called "instrument of appointment" by
China's President Hu Jintao, confirming his post after he won a
re-selection vote last month.


Hong Kong's leaders are not elected by the people but by a
committee of 800 elites who are mostly loyal to the city's
communist rulers in China. Tsang won an easy victory over pro-
democracy candidate Alan Leong.


The former British colony was returned to China in 1997. The
freewheeling capitalist city exists as a largely autonomous
territory within the authoritarian Chinese state under a "one
country, two systems" arrangement that allows it political
freedoms not enjoyed anywhere else in China.


Tsang was first appointed chief executive in 2005 when he took
over the truncated second term of the southern Chinese
territory's first post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, who
resigned early due to poor health.


Although the devout Catholic Tsang was not elected by the people
of Hong Kong, he retains huge public support following his
40-years as a civil servant, including stints as financial
secretary and deputy leader.


Hu will meet Tsang on Monday morning in the Great Hall of the
People.


Tsang is expected to give a brief press conference later in the
day.
