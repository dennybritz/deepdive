Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah proposed on Sunday that a
referendum could resolve the political deadlock between the pro-
and anti-Syrian camps in Lebanon.


A solution to the crisis since the six pro-Syrian ministers
walked out of the Western-backed government in November,
paralysing the cabinet, could come through "either organisating a
referendum or holding early elections", he said.


Nasrallah, whose Syrian-backed Shiite Muslim group heads the
opposition, has been pressing for the formation of a new
government of national unity while the cabinet of Prime Minister
Fuad Siniora has ruled out early polls.


In criticising Siniora, the Hezbollah leader said in a televised
speech that the way to resolve domestic problems was "not to
resort to foreign parties but to the people".


Hezbollah would not allow itself to be dragged into a civil war,
Nasrallah reasserted. "We will continue to use peaceful,
democratic and civil means" of protest.


He said the Siniora government was deluding itself by counting on
major regional changes to transform the situation in Lebanon,
such as a US attack on Iran, another major backer of Hezbollah.
