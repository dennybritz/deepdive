The Rhine river, part of Europe's main inland waterway, was open
again Sunday after being blocked for nearly 12 hours after a
boating accident that left one man dead and another missing,
police said.


The boat, 15-metre (49-foot) long and four metres wide, capsized
seven kilometres (four miles) from the southwestern city of Mainz
on Saturday. The reason for the accident remained unknown.


The body of a 77-year-old man was fished out of the river on
Saturday at the site of the accident, while the search for the 65
-year-old owner of the boat continued on Sunday.


Special cranes were to be used to haul the boat out of the water.


The halt in river traffic came just weeks after the Rhine was
blocked for nearly six days after shipping containers fell off a
barge.


Meanwhile, a collision between a tanker and a cargo boat late
Saturday at the crossing of the Middelland and Dortmund-Ems
canals near Horstel in western Germany led to back-ups in
traffic, the Duisburg river police said.


Some 30 boats were unable to move forward and traffic was not
expected to get moving again until Sunday evening.


One of the vessels in Saturday's crash suffered damage to its
250-tonne fuel tank, and about a dozen tonnes of bio-diesel
leaked out. The rest of the fuel had been successfully pumped
out.


Divers were meanwhile set to plug a three-metre hole in the hull
of the tanker, which was transporting 1,000 tonnes of bio-diesel.
