Three Turkish soldiers and one pro-Turkish militia member were
killed in clashes with Kurdish rebels in southeastern Turkey,
security sources said on Sunday.


Two soldiers and a "village guard", a Kurdish militia member
armed by Ankara to fight Kurdish separatists, were killed
fighting members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the
mountainous Sirnak region that borders Iraq overnight Saturday to
Sunday, according to the security source, who asked not to be
named.


A third soldier died when a PKK mine exploded in the eastern
Bitlis province, the source added.


The four deaths bring the number of pro-Turkish troops killed
over the past two days to six.


On Friday, two Turkish soldiers and two Kurdish rebels were
killed in clashes in the same area. Four troops were injured in
the fighting.


More than 37,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the PKK,
which is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the
United States and the European Union, took up arms for self-rule
in the mainly Kurdish southeast of Turkey.


The PKK announced a ceasefire in October, but Turkish authorities
rejected it. Violence related to the conflict has however since
dwindled.
