Tatiana Golovin captured the first WTA Tour title of her career
here Sunday with a confident straight-set victory over top seed
and defending champion Nadia Petrova.


The eighth-seeded Golovin, ranked 20th in the world, defeated
world No. 7 Petrova 6-2, 6-1 in just 1hr 16min.


The 19-year-old Russian-born French player claimed her first
title after three runner-up finishes - one each in 2004, 2005 and
2006.


Although she holds a career advantage over Petrova, it was
Petrova who had denied her most recent bid for a title, in the
final in Stuttgart last October.


Golovin's progress to the final here included a quarter-final
victory over five- time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams and a
semi-final triumph over sixth- seeded Serbian Ana Ivanovic.
