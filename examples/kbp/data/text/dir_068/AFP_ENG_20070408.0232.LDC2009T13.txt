Italian Alessandro Ballan of the Lampre team won the 91st edition
of the Tour of Flanders, held over 259km between Bruges and here
Sunday.


Ballan, who thus becomes the first Italian since Andrea Tafi in
2002 to win the race known as the 'Ronde', surged ahead of Leif
Hoste of the Predictor team to snatch victory from the Belgian in
the closing metres before the finish.


Both riders had managed to pull ahead in the final 20km of the
race, in which Belgium's two-time winner Tom Boonen fell out of
contention towards the end, and worked together to keep their
chasers at bay.


A chasing pack of riders were in hot pursuit, just behind another
pair of victory hopefuls Tomas Vaitkus and Karsten Kroon.


As the leaders raced towards the finish line, Hoste, who has
previously claimed a number of runner-up places in the race
including last year when he finished behind Boonen, was forced to
stay on Ballan's wheel.


The Italian is known as a formidable sprinter, and when Hoste
attacked in the last 200 metres he was allowed only a brief
advantage before Ballan pulled up behind him and overtook the
Belgian just two metres before the line.


Boonen had won the past two years and had been bidding to become
the first rider in over half a century to win the race three
times consecutively.
