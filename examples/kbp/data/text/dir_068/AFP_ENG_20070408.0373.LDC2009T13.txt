The Democratic Republic of Congo's most prominent opposition
party, whose allies recently clashed with the military, said
Sunday the government had created a "climate of terror."


The party of former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba said in a
statement that its headquarters has been occupied by the guard of
President Joseph Kabila since last month's clashes that resulted
in at least 200 deaths.


The party, called the Congo Liberation Movement, also condemned
what it called "arbitrary arrests" and "acts of intimidation" it
said was aimed at destroying the opposition.


It said recent searches of party members' homes had been carried
out without proper warrants.


Bemba, also a failed presidential candidate and former rebel
leader, has been holed up in the South African embassy since the
March 22 and 23 clashes.


The fighting occurred after Bemba refused to have his guard
integrated into the military.
