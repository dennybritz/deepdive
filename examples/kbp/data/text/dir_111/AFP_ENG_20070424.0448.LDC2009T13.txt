The US State Department denied suggestions Tuesday that major
power mediators for Middle East peace would meet next week in
Egypt on the sidelines of a conference on Iraq's security.


German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said earlier
Tuesday that the so-called Mideast Quartet grouping the European
Union, United Nations, United States and Russia would meet "at
the beginning of May in Egypt."


Steinmeier did not mention specific dates, but he appeared to be
referring to a planned meeting of international leaders at the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh May 3-4 for a security
conference on Iraq.


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said she will attend
that meeting, and her counterparts from the other Quartet members
are also expected to participate.


But Rice's spokesman, Sean McCormack, insisted a formal Quartet
meeting was not on the agenda for the trip.


"Maybe at some point in the future, but not on this coming trip,"
he said.
