Bulgaria, which joined the European Union on January 1 this year,
has fully repaid its debt to the International Monetary Fund, the
finance ministry said Tuesday.


The ministry announced that the country had paid back the last
share of its debt with two early payments, one of 109.64 million
dollars and another of 149.13 million euros.


This is the third and last advance payment of Bulgaria's debt to
the IMF.


The country had already repaid 147.4 million euros at the end of
2005 and then in February 2006 a further 151.4 million euros.


The latest transaction "will lead to a reduction of the country's
state and state-guaranteed external debt that by March 31, 2007
stood at 4.34 billion euros or 16.6 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP)," a finance ministry statement said.


It would also "contribute to maintaining the stability and
reducing the vulnerability of the economy to negative external
shocks and will help hold gross external debt growth rate, both
nominally and as a share of gross domestic product," it added.


The IMF was one of Bulgaria's biggest creditors. An austerity
policy imposed by the IMF in 1997 in exchange for emergency funds
enabled Bulgaria to emerge from a severe economic crisis
following the fall of communism in 1989.
