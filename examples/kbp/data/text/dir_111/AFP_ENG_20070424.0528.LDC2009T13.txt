EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said the decision of the
armed wing of the Palestinian movement Hamas to end a five-month
truce with Israel was "very bad news".


He urged Hamas and Israel to "behave in a constructive manner"
after the Palestinian movement abandoned a truce in response to
Israeli raids.


"This is very bad news and we hope very much that this is not an
end of a process that has been maintained with peace and
moderation for a long time," Solana said.


"I plead with everybody on both sides to really behave in a
constructive manner because there is a window of opportunity in
which things that are positive may take place," he told
journalists in Luxembourg.


"Everybody has a responsibility not to contribute to make
difficult or impossible these movements in the right direction."


The armed wing of the movement Hamas earlier Tuesday declared its
five-month truce with Israel over after Israeli forces killed
nine Palestinians in a series of raids over the weekend.


The group, which the United States and Europe consider
terrorists, quickly fired a salvo of mortar shells and homemade
rockets into southern Israel. Tuesday was the anniversary of the
Jewish state's creation.


Under the terms of the truce announced last November, Israel's
army withdrew troops from the Gaza Strip in return for an
undertaking by militant groups to halt rocket fire into Israel.


The truce largely held, but not all groups signed up to it on the
Palestinian side and some rocket fire against Israel continued.
