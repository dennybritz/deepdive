Former Germany Under-21 international Jermaine Jones will join
Schalke 04 at the end of the season, the Bundesliga leaders
announced on Tuesday afternoon.


The 26-year-old Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder, who has missed
most of the season with a knee injury, has signed a deal until
2011 and will replace Schalke's Bayern Munich-bound Turkish
international Hamit Altintop.


"Schalke are a traditional club with big ambitions and are on the
verge of winning the Bundesliga title," said Jones.


"They have got great facilities and are the sort of side any
footballer would want to play for."


Schalke manager Andreas Mueller said the club are delighted to
capture the flamboyant Jones, the son of a US soldier based in
Germany, who has also spent a season at Bayer Leverkusen.


"Jermaine plays the kind of football which fits 100 percent into
our style," said Mueller.


"He is an aggressive and dynamic player, our fans will be glad to
have him here."


Schalke coach Mirko Slomka added: "Jermaine is superb in the
middle of the park, he is the ideal replacement for Hamit
Altintop.


"His strength and his athleticism make him a valuable asset."


Schalke are two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with
four games to go.
