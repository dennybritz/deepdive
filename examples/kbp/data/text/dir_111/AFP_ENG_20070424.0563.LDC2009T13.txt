Yemeni authorities ordered Tuesday the closure of all arms
markets pending the introduction of a new licencing system in a
bid to control the trade in a country with one of the highest
rates of private gun ownership in the world.


The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Ali Mohammed Majur.


The interior ministry will be responsible for forming committees
to draw up lists of all gun shops and weapons markets and their
owners will then be required to apply for licences.


According to a 2005 study, the main arms markets lie in the
provincial towns of Jahana, Saada, Al-Baydha, Al-Jawf and Abyan,
but there are also some 300 smaller markets dotted around the
impoverished Arabian peninsula republic.


Yemen has an estimated 60 million firearms in private hands,
roughly three for every man, woman and child.


Gunownership has long been seen as an essential part of Yemeni
culture.


But the persistent threat from Al-Qaeda in Osama bin Laden's
ancestral homeland and a four-year-old sectarian uprising in
Yemen's northern mountains have piled on pressure for greater
controls.
