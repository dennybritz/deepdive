The Italian cabinet on Tuesday adopted a draft law which would
make it easier for foreign workers to enter the country, a move
immediately attacked by the conservative opposition.


Once the law is adopted by parliament, immigrants will receive
work permits more easily than now if they are sponsored by local
authorities, unions or company chiefs.


Workers offering domestic services would also find entering Italy
easier, while highly-qualified staff would no longer be included
in immigration quotas, further boosting legal immigration.


Interior minister Giuliano Amato said current rules on foreign
labour, enshrined in the so-called "Bossi-Fini" law, had
increased illegal immigration.


The Italian right slammed the proposal, calling it
"catastrophic".


Italy had 2.7 million legal foreign residents at the start of
2006, two million more than a decade ago.
