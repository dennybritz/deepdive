Seven people were killed when a car exploded outside a hotel
housing government officials in the Somali capital Mogadishu,
witnesses said Tuesday.


"There was a car explosion outside the hotel. I saw saw smoke
from the exploded car," said Mohamed Hassan Dahir, an employee of
the Ambassador Hotel.


"Seven people were killed and some of them were burnt beyond
recognition," said Abdirahman Ibrahim, a driver in the area when
the blast occurred.


"Hotel guards were among the the dead," he added. Hotel
management declined to comment.


Witnesses said the dead included four civilians who were passing
in front of the hotel in southern Mogadishu.


The hotel hosts cabinet ministers, army commanders, members of
parliament and other top officials in the government of Somali
President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed.


The attack followed the detonation of a suicide truck bomb in an
Ethiopian military camp outside Mogadishu, and came as heavy
shelling and tank fire rattled the Somali capital for a seventh
day.


Ethiopian troops have in recent weeks stepped up their campaign
to drive out Islamist insurgents, in support of the country's
weak transitional government.


At least 256 people have died and hundreds have been wounded
since the latest upsurge in fighting began last week, according
to the Elman Peace and Human Rights Organisation, which monitors
casualty rates.
