Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso and his former rival,
ex-prime minister Bernard Kolelas, buried the hatchet Tuesday by
agreeing to jointly contest parliamentary polls in June.


The ruling Congolese Workers' Party and the Congolese Movement
for Democracy and Development headed by Kolelas, who returned
home in 2005 after eight years in exile, agreed to "rule
together," according to the pact signed by Kolelas and ruling
party general secretary Ambroise Noumalzalay.


The pact is aimed at forming an "alliance ... which will have a
comfortable and stable majority in legislative, local, senate and
presidential elections."


Legislative elections will be held on June 24 while presidential
elections are scheduled for 2009.


The agreement said the pact could be widened to include other
parties as long as "they respect the letter and spirit" of the
accord.


Sassou Nguesso, 64, has not stated whether he will contest the
presidential elections. Kolelas, who is 71, cannot be a candidate
as the constitution caps the age limit for aspirants at 70.


Kolelas, a former mayor of Brazzaville and prime minister, left
the Congo in 1997 when armed militias led by Sassou Nguesso
overran the country.


He was sentenced to death in absentia in 2000 for war crimes but
was pardoned by Sassou Nguesso and returned home.
