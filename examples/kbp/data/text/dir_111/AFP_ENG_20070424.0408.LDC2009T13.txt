Police in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal have arrested
six people for illegally trading in human skulls and bones
following complaints bodies were missing from graveyards, a
senior officer said Tuesday.


Acting on a tip off, police raided two places in Purbasthali
village, 170 kilometres (105 miles) northwest of the state
capital Kolkata late Sunday, Superintendent Peeyush Pandey said.


Police recovered at least 50 skulls and skeletons -- treated with
chemicals -- packed in jute bags and hidden underground, Pandey
said.


"We received complaints that several bodies were missing from
graveyards and, while investigating the case, we stumbled on the
secret bones factory," he said.


The arrested men confessed the bones were sold to medical
students and used in the manufacture of traditional medicines, he
said.


"We have also got information that the skeletons seized during
the raids were to be shipped to buyers in China, Hong Kong and
Bangladesh with each skeleton fetching 1,200 rupees to 2,500
rupees (27 to 56 dollars)," Pandey said.


"The arrested people have confessed that the skeletons have been
stolen from the graveyard in the nearby villages," he added.


Trade in human bones and skeletons is banned in India with
medical students using plastic skeletons.
