Morocco is under continuous threat from terrorist attacks,
Interior Minister Chakib Benmoussa told the senate Tuesday, less
than a fortnight after a series of suicide bombings rocked
Casablanca.


"The danger is always present and terrorism threatens this
country at all times," he said in response to questions about the
five suicide bombers who blew themselves up in the port city
between April 10 and 14.


The explosions followed another suicide bombing in the city on
March 11.


Benmoussa said security alert levels had been increased and
surveillance stepped up in Ouarzarzate, Errachidia and Figuig,
towns which border Algeria.


He also highlighted the need to increase anti-terrorism
cooperation with Morocco's allies.


"The forces of terrorism still represent a real threat and we
must therefore maintain a state of vigilance and caution in the
administration, among lawmakers and in all sections of society,"
Benmoussa said.


"It's the only way to thwart our enemies' plans for our country."


The minister said Morocco was deploying 2,000 extra policemen to
Casablanca, and was training a further 2,700 security agents to
begin work in June.
