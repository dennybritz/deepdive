Britain's Prince Andrew and former prime minister Sir John Major
will attend the funeral of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin
on Wednesday.


The former Kremlin leader's body will be buried alongside eminent
Russians at Moscow's historic Novodevichy cemetery. Yeltsin died
Monday due to heart failure aged 76.


Andrew will attend on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, a Buckingham
Palace spokeswoman told AFP.


The Duke of York, 47, is the queen's second son and is fourth in
line to the throne.


Major, who was Britain's prime minister from 1990 to 1997, during
the fall of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the new Russia
under Yeltsin, will attend in a personal capacity, the Foreign
Office said.


Major, 64, said Monday that Yeltsin was "a man of great courage
and conviction".


He said that they enjoyed a "firm friendship that lasted
throughout my years in office" and continued afterwards.


Britain's ambassador to Russia, Tony Brenton, will also attend.


Yeltsin played an important role in bringing down the communist
Soviet Union in 1991 and transformed Russia into a capitalist
democracy prompted soul-searching across the world's biggest
country.


He was Russia's president from July 1991 to December 1999.
