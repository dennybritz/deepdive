The Slovak central bank decided Tuesday to lower its key interest
rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25 percent, a spokeswoman for
the bank announced.


The National Bank of Slovakia also cut its one-day refinancing
rate by a quarter of a point to 5.75 percent.


The changes will take effect from Wednesday, the spokeswoman
added.


The bank opted to cut the cost of borrowing for the last time in
March, trimming its main rate by 0.25 percentage points.


The cuts follow a recent strengthening of the Slovak koruna.
