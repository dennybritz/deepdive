US President George W. Bush on Tuesday vowed to veto an emergency
Iraq war- funding bill if it reaches his desk still setting an
April 1, 2008 goal for withdrawing most US combat forces.


In a statement on the South Lawn of the White House, Bush said he
was "disappointed" by the legislation and warned that any pull-
out timetable would "embolden our enemies" and "handcuff our
generals."
