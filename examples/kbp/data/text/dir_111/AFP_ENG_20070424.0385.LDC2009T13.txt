Tony Blair became the first British prime minister to answer
questions from users of Internet video sharing site YouTube, as
part of his governing Labour Party's move to attract younger
voters.


Interviewer John O'Farrell, a Labour supporter who wrote the 1998
book "Things Can Only Better" about the party's wilderness years
in the 1980s, said it was a moment of "web history."


"Margaret Thatcher never did it, Harold Macmillan never did it,
Winston Churchill never did it. I don't know what their excuse
was," he said.


The interviews with Blair are being broadcast in three parts --
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- with the first questions
largely concentrating on the war in Iraq.


Blair, who marks 10 years in power on May 2, answered four
questions from YouTube users, listing what he considered to be
the party's greatest achievements in the last decade but refusing
to mention his biggest mistake.


On Iraq, he offered a fresh defence of Britain's involvement in
removing president Saddam Hussein and said it would have been a
resigning matter if he and the government had deliberately
deceived the public about the reasons for war.


Although a self-confessed computer illiterate, it is Blair's
second appearance on his party's channel on YouTube,
www.youtube.com/labourvision, which was launched last month to
court the more computer-savvy youth vote.


Elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and some
English local councils take place on May 3.


Opinion polls suggest Labour could be in for a hammering.
