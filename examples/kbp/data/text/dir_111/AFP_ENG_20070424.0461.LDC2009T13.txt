A suicide truck bomber attacked an Iraqi police checkpoint north
of the city of Ramadi on Tuesday and killed 13 people, including
four policemen, local security chief Colonel Tareq al-Dulaimi
said.


"There was great damage to buildings at the scene, which is a
built-up residential area," Dulaimi told AFP by telephone from
the restive western city, adding that 25 people were wounded in
the attack.


The attack came one day after two suicide car bombers struck a
cafe and a police checkpoint in Ramadi, killing three people, and
a similar attack killed nine US soldiers in Diyala province,
north of Baghdad.


The assault on US soldiers has been claimed by a an Al Qaeda-led
group of Sunni insurgent groups, the so-called Islamic State of
Iraq, and was the deadliest attack on US ground forces in 16
months.


Meanwhile, in other violence Tuesday, five civilians were killed
and 25 wounded when mortar shells crashed into the town of
Zafaraniyah, south of the war-torn capital Baghdad, epicentre of
Iraq's sectarian conflict.
