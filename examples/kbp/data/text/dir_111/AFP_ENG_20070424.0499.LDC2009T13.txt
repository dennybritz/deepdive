Petroleum giant Esso is to spend three million euros (four
million dollars) to help fund the battle against malaria in
Angola, state-run media reported on Tuesday.


The money will go towards financing ongoing programmes being run
by the country's health ministry and coordinated by provisional
authorities, the Angop news agency reported from the capital
Luanda.


The announcement comes on the eve of African Malaria Day which is
designed to raise awareness about a disease which kills about one
million people a year worldwide, 90 percent of them in sub-
Saharan Africa, according to the World Health Organisation.


The Angola government launched an action plan last year to halve
the number of cases of malaria by the end of the decade in a
country where up to 30,000 people are thought to die of the
disease every year.
