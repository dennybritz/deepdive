Lithuanian police have detained two Belarussians suspected of
trying to smuggle uranium from the Baltic state to Belarus, the
Vilnius prosecutor's office said Tuesday.


"Two Belarussian citizens were detained on Sunday evening when
they tried to cross the Lithuania-Belarus border," Aleksandras
Juozapaitis, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told AFP.


"An iron box with 'uranium' inscribed on it in Russian was found
hidden in their car," he added.


Juozapaitis refused to give more details, other than to say the
two had been detained following a long-term international
operation.


He also said that the content of the iron box had been sent to
experts, who will determine whether the seized cargo really was
radioactive uranium.


A court here on Tuesday authorised the two suspects to be held
for one month, awaiting the outcome of the investigation,
Juozapaitis said.
