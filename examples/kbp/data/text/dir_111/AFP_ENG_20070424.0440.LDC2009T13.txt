The United States denounced the jailing Tuesday of Syrian human
rights activist Anwar Bunni as a "sad commentary" on the state of
political freedom under the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.


Bunni was sentenced to five years in prison Tuesday for
"spreading false information which weakens the nation," his
lawyer said.


Bunni was arrested in the Syrian capital in May 2006 after
signing an appeal for radical reform in relations between Syria
and neighboring Lebanon.


"It's a sad commentary on the state of political freedom in Syria
where an individual who is talking about legitimate issues about
the way Syria is ruled is put in jail summarily," said State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack.


"It's entirely consistent with past Syrian behavior and it's one
of the reasons why we're going to continue to highlight the lack
of political and other freedoms in Syria," McCormack told
reporters.


Washington accuses the Assad government of allowing anti-US
insurgents to cross Syria's border into Iraq and of supporting
terrorist groups in Lebanon and in the Palestinian territories.


The US withdrew its ambassador from Damascus after linking Syria
to the February 2005 assassination in Beirut of former Lebanese
prime minister Rafiq Hariri, an outspoken opponent of Syrian
dominance over his country.
