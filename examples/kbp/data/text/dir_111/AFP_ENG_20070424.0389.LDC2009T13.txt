Doctors examined US Vice President Dick Cheney's left leg on
Tuesday and found that a blood clot discovered last month after a
nine-day trip to Asia was "gradually resolving," his office said.


"The Vice President visited his doctors at the George Washington
University Medical Faculty Associates this morning for an
ultrasound of the clot (deep venous thrombosis) in his left leg,"
said spokeswoman Megan McGinn.


"The ultrasound was reassuring and showed that the clot is
gradually resolving. His blood thinning medication was found to
be in the desired range," she said in a statement.


"The Vice President's doctors advised him to continue the current
course of treatment. He has returned to the White House to resume
his normal schedule," said McGinn.


The 66-year-old vice president, who has suffered four heart
attacks, had sought medical attention on March 5 for a blood clot
in his left leg and was told to take blood thinning medication
for several months.


He had just traveled some 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) and
logged 65 hours on an airplane on a nine-day trip to Japan,
Australia, Pakistan and Afghanistan when he first sought
treatment.


Cheney had his fourth heart attack in 2000, the year he and US
President George W. Bush won the White House. He underwent an
angioplasty weeks after being sworn in as vice president in 2001.


In September 2005 he had an operation for blood clots behind each
of his knees, and in January 2006 he was hospitalized for
shortness of breath.
