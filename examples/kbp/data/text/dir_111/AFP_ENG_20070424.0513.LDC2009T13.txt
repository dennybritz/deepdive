An opposition party in the Democratic Republic of Congo returned
to parliament on Tuesday, ending an 11-day boycott brought on by
alleged government intimidation.


Christian Democrat lawmakers, who had accused President Joseph
Kabila's forces and government of intimidation, harrassment and
attacks, said they had received guarantees of "freedom of
expression and safety".


Two other opposition parties, including the main Congolese
Liberation Movement (MLC) of losing presidential candidate Jean-
Pierre Bemba, said they would make a decision on the matter on
Wednesday.


National assembly speaker Vital Kamerhe said Kabila intended to
meet opposition deputies, who had sent the president a memorandum
outlining their grievances.


Kamerhe added that he had asked the interior ministry to ensure
the police "put in place a rapid response plan for the security
of lawmakers".


The MLC headquarters were ransacked by the military after clashes
on March 22 and 23, and radio and television stations owned by
Bemba were also looted.


The clashes between the Congolese army and Bemba's guard caused
between 200 and 500 deaths, according to diplomatic sources.


Fighting broke out after Bemba, an arch-rival of Kabila, refused
to have his bodyguards integrated into the regular army.


Bemba stayed in the South African embassy afterwards until
leaving for Portugal, officially for medical treatment.


The DRC's state prosecutor is seeking to have Bemba's immunity
lifted so he can face charges related to last month's violence.
