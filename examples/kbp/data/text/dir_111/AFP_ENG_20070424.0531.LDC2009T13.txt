Ecuador's Congress on Tuesday dismissed the Supreme Court judges
after they reinstated 50 lawmakers who were ousted in March for
opposing constitutional reforms, according to congressional vice
president Byron Pacheco.


"The nine members of the Constitutional Court have been
dismissed," said Pacheco, insisting the motion to remove them
predated the court's ruling on Monday.


Pacheco said the judges had overstayed the term for which
Congress had elected them.
