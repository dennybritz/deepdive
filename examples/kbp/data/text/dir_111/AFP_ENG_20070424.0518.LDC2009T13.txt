A Slovenian brown bear imported to France last year has given
birth to two cubs, the French hunting and wildlife agency, ONCFS,
said Tuesday.


"The two cubs were observed Monday from a great distance. They
were next to their mother and they were playing near the den,"
said Pierre-Yves Quenette, head of ONCFS.


The agency has been keeping an eye on the mother, Hvala, and
three other bears brought from Slovenia last year to France's
southern Pyrenees mountains as part of a programme to ensure the
species' survival.


Quenette said the cubs appeared to have been born in January.


Hvala was the last of the four bears to emerge from hibernation
and the only one to have given birth so far.


Anti-bear activists who claim the bears attack livestock mounted
fierce opposition to their introduction, planting traps of honey
laced with glass shards and staging demonstrations.
