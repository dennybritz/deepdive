The White House on Tuesday branded Syria's parliamentary
elections "a meaningless exercise" marred by unfair laws and
intimidation tactics by the authorities.


"On April 22 and 23, (Syrian) President (Bashar) al-Assad failed
again to deliver on his long-promised reforms, rendering Syria's
parliamentary elections a meaningless exercise," spokeswoman Dana
Perino said in a statement.
