Prominent Cuban dissident Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, known as
Antunez, has been released after serving 17 years in jail as a
political prisoner, dissident sources said Tuesday.


Garcia Perez, 42, left prison in Villa Clara, after serving his
17 years and 37 days, for "verbal enemy propaganda," and failing
to respect Cuban leader Fidel Castro, said an opposition
spokesman, Elizardo Sanchez.


Antunez was arrested for speaking out against Castro, who leads
the Americas' only one-party communist regime, on March 15, 1990.


Cuba's government insists there are no political prisoners.


Dissident sources say there are almost 300.
