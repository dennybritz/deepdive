Sri Lanka were 84-2 after 20 overs of their World Cup semi-final
against New Zealand at Sabina Park here on Tuesday.


The winners will play either Australia or South Africa in
Saturday's final in Barbados.


Upul Tharanga was on 49 with captain Mahela Jayawardene on six.


Dangerman Sanath Jayasuriya was the first man out for the 1996
champions when he was clean bowled hitting across the line off a
James Franklin delivery for just one in the third over with the
score on 13.


Kumar Sangakkara was caught by New Zealand captain Stephen
Fleming at mid-on for 18 off Franklin in the 14th over with the
score on 67.


Jayawardene won the toss and elected to bat.


New Zealand welcomed back fast bowler Shane Bond and pace bowling
all-rounder Jacob Oram who missed Friday's 215-run defeat by
Australia. Off-spinner Jeetan Patel retained his place.


Sri Lanka's unorthodox fast bowler Lasith Malinga returned to the
team after three games out with ankle ligament damage and Dilhara
Fernando also returned after missing the team's last match, an
eight-wicket thrashing of minnows Ireland, with an ankle problem.


Under-pressure opening batsman Tharanga retained his place,
seeing off the challenge of the experienced Marvan Atapattu.


When the teams met in a Super Eights match in Grenada on April
12, Sri Lanka won by six wickets.
