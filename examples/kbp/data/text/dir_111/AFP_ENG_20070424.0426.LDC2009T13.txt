US President George W. Bush called Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on
the occasion of Israel's Independence Day on Tuesday and the two
discussed recent peace efforts, Olmert's office said.


"President Bush called Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to wish him a
happy Independence Day. The two also discussed regional issues,
including the Saudi peace initiative," a statement said.


Olmert said earlier this month that he was ready for talks with
Arab leaders to discuss the Saudi-drafted plan and called on Arab
nations to convene such a meeting.


At a summit in Riyadh last month, Arab leaders revived the five-
year-old peace plan. It offers Israel normal relations if it
withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 Middle East war,
allows for the creation of a Palestinian state and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
