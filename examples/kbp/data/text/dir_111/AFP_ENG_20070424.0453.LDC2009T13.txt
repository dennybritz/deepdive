A suicide truck bomber attacked an Iraqi police checkpoint north
of the city of Ramadi on Tuesday and killed 13 people, including
four policemen, local security chief Colonel Tareq al-Dulaimi
said.


"There was great damage to buildings at the scene, which is a
built-up residential area," Dulaimi, told AFP by telephone from
the restive western city, adding that 25 people were wounded in
the attack.
