The only Canadian detainee held at the US war-on-terror camp at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- Omar Khadr, who was arrested in
Afghanistan in 2002, at age 16 -- has officially been charged
with murder, spying and supporting terrorism, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.


The indictment says prosecutors will not seek the death penalty
in the trial which should be held in the next four months before
a special military tribunal on the US naval base on Cuba's
southeastern tip.


A hearing should be held in the next month's time, at which the
charges will be explained to the accused, and he will have a
first chance to offer a plea.


Prosecutors say Omar Khadr, 20, is the son of an Al-Qaeda
official who now is dead. Born in Canada, he joined his father in
Afghanistan where he underwent military training. He was arrested
in July 2002.
