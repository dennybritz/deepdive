Beijing Tuesday strongly condemned an attack on a Chinese-run oil
field in Ethiopia in which 74 people including nine Chinese were
killed, state media said.


Foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said one Chinese person
was also slightly wounded and seven others kidnapped in the
attack by more than 200 gunmen, the official Xinhua news agency
reported.


"The Chinese government strongly condemns this atrocious armed
attack, mourns for the Chinese and Ethiopian victims and
expresses deep sympathies to their families and those injured in
the attack," said Liu.


He added that Beijing had asked Ethiopia to take concrete and
effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese workers in the
country.


Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing held a telephone
conversation with his Ethiopian counterpart Seyoum Mesfin, who is
on a visit to the United States, the agency said in a separate
dispatch.


"The two ministers talked on issues of common concern," it said,
quoting a foreign ministry press release.


Unidentified gunmen attacked the oil field in Somali state where
China's Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau is searching for
oil, according to a company manager quoted earlier by Xinhua.


The company has chartered an plane to collect the bodies of the
nine dead workers, Xinhua said.


China has stepped up investment and exploration in African oil
fields in recent years as its appetite for energy has boomed
along with its growing economy.
