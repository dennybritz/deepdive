Bolivian police on Tuesday searched a La Paz house owned by
former president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who is being
investigated for the deaths of dozens of people killed during in
a 2003 demonstration.


Authorities said they were searching for documents that may
provide details of the then government's handling of the violent
2003 crisis that eventually led to Sanchez de Lozada's
resignation.


The former president is under investigation for his role in the
violence, in which 63 people were killed and 432 were wounded as
police and military troops clashed with strikers who protested
plans to export natural gas to the United States through Chile.


Bilateral relations have been tense ever since Bolivia was left
landlocked by Chile's annexation of disputed territory more than
100 years ago.


Sanchez de Lozada resigned in October 2003, barely 14 months into
his second five-year term, and left for the United States.
