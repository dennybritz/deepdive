Former Ireland forward Trevor Brennan will have his appeal
against a lifetime ban heard by European rugby bosses on June 1,
the European Rugby Council said on Tuesday.


The 33-year-old, who has since retired, was banned for life after
repeatedly punching Ulster supporter Patrick Bamford during a
European Cup match on January 21 while he was playing for French
giants Toulouse.


Brennan claimed that the spectator had verbally abused him while
he was warming up on the touchline prompting him to launch
himself into the crowd and attack Bamford.


Brennan was also fined 25,000 euros and ordered to pay a further
5,000 to Bamford.
