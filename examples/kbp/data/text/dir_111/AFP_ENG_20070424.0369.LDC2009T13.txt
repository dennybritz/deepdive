A series of explosions on Tuesday hit an ammunition depot at a
military base in central Thailand, an army spokesman said.


Colonel Chanathit Sawangsang said that the military had evacuated
all army personnel and their families from the blast site in
Lopburi province.


He could not confirm whether anyone was injured or killed in the
blasts as emergency services, military and police had been unable
to reach the compound because the explosions were still rocking
the army base.


"There were multiple explosions at an ammunition depot belonging
to the army," Chanathit told AFP. "As of now, there is nobody
going to the site of the explosions."


He said it was too early to tell what the caused the explosions,
which began at about 8:00 pm (1300 GMT).


Police in Lopburi said the army depot was 10 kilometres (six
miles) away from the provincial capital Lopburi.
