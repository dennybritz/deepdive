Africa's path out of poverty requires the creation of quality
jobs, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said at its
regional Africa meeting opening on Tuesday in Addis Ababa.


Strong economic growth had failed to stem rising unemployment and
growing numbers of working poor, it said.


"Despite (the) upturn, African economies still lack enough decent
jobs," the ILO said.


Africa requires 11 million new jobs every year but generates just
8.6 million, a shortfall that encourages young talent to seek
work in richer economies, it warned.


But even existing jobs mostly fail to lift families out of
poverty.


"Four workers out of five in Africa don't earn enough to keep
their families above the poverty level of one dollar per day,"
ILO director-general Juan Somavia told the meeting.


"Growth without the creation of good jobs is untenable
politically. So something is wrong with the political advice of
the past 25 years," he said.


According to ILO projections, the percentage of African families
living with less than two dollars per day will drop slightly by
2015, to 76.4 percent.


But demographic growth will cause a rise in the number of people
living in extreme poverty, to 317 million from 260 million last
year, the ILO said.


At the ILO meeting, 500 delegates, representing workers,
employers and African labour ministries, are until Friday to
debate ways of safeguarding Africa's human capital in the face of
emigration, unemployment and HIV-AIDS.
