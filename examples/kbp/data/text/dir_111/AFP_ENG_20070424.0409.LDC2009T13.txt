Air Canada announced Tuesday the purchase of 23 new Boeing 787
aircraft, bringing its total order for the Dreamliner to 37 jets,
with deliveries starting in 2010.


Canada's largest carrier agreed previously to buy 14 of aircraft
to replace its aging Airbus A340 and A330 and Boeing 767 fleets.


With this purchase, Air Canada becomes the largest North American
customer for the Dreamliner, the company said in a statement.


"The Boeing 787 aircraft features better operational performance
in terms of speed and flight range, providing us with the ability
to serve new markets that could not be previously served in an
efficient manner," said Montie Brewer, Air Canada president and
chief executive officer.


"With new Boeing and Embraer aircraft entering the fleet, we will
continue with our overall strategy of matching capacity with
demand, which has produced more than three consecutive years of
record breaking load factors."


Air Canada estimates fuel usage and maintenance costs for a
Boeing 787 aircraft to be approximately 30 percent less than that
of a Boeing 767.


The deal is estimated to be worth 3.5 billion dollars.
