Former Australia skipper Ian Chappell believes the world
champions scare opponents even before a match begins and that
South Africa must conquer those fears if they are to win
Wednesday's World Cup semi-final.


Chappell said that South Africa need to win the toss at
Beausejour and set the world champions a decent total if they are
to have any hope of reaching their first ever World Cup final.


"Every batting team seems to fear Australia and never comes after
them," said Chappell.


"But Australia will be delighted they are facing South Africa
because their bowling suits them. The South African attack is
one-dimensional and the Aussies like to bully the opposition
during the first 10 overs so that bowling side is defending from
that point on.


"You have to try and limit the damage the top three of Hayden,
Gilchrist and Ponting can do."


Chappell told www.cricinfo.com that the best hope for Graeme
Smith's side, who have already lost to Ricky Ponting's men by 85
runs in the group stages, is to bat first.


"If South Africa win the toss they should bat and build a total,"
he said.


"Smith and AB de Villiers tannned the Australian attack (160-run
opening partnership in St Kitts) and they need to repeat that.


"South Africa have batting down the middle and have the ability
to post a big target. But if Australia bat first, South Africa
will struggle to contain them. I see Australia winning."
