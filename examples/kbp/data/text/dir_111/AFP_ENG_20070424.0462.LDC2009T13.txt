Italian yacht Luna Rossa suffered a shock defeat to South African
Team Shosholoza on Tuesday as the Louis Vuitton Cup saw racing
for only the third time in nine days.


Wind speeds of eight knots, just enough to allow racing to go
ahead, meant for only the third day since the Cup began at the
beginning of last week, the 11 challengers took to the waters
around Valencia.


One of the early favourites Emirates Team New Zealand, who
themselves suffered a surprise defeat to Mascalzone Latino in
their first race, were first to take to the waters and soundly
beat French outfit Areva Challenge in the first round robin
series.


The New Zealand team were quick off the mark and steadily
increased their advantage before winning by almost two minutes.


Next up was Luna Rossa, unbeaten until now, but they were stunned
by Shosholoza who held on for a victory by 36 seconds.


That win went some way to appeasing the South African's leader
Salvatore Sarno, who was incensed that racing was cancelled on
Monday.


"We are very, very unhappy because it was possible to navigate
today," he said Monday night.


"We believe the big teams are putting pressure on the race
committee not to give the green light to racing."


BMW Oracle Racing remain the only unbeaten team after defeating
Swedes Victory Challenge while Mascalzone Latino lost their
unbeaten record with a defeat to Spaniards Desafio.
