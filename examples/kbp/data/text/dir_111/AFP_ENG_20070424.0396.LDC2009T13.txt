The White House Tuesday dismissed French presidential hopeful
Segolene Royal's vow never to genuflect to US President George W.
Bush as the product of "internal French political squabbles."


The Socialist candidate to succeed French President Jacques
Chirac declared in September: "My foreign policy will not consist
of going to kneel before George Bush."


Asked to comment on that statement, Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino
told reporters: "I'm going to decline to comment on internal
French political squabbles."


The White House has studiously kept quiet about the election,
firmly brushing aside questions about whether it has a favorite
in the second-round May 6 runoff between Royal and the right-wing
Nicolas Sarkozy.


On Monday, Perino said she would not touch questions on that
subject "with a 20-foot pole" and insisted "We'll let the French,
in two weeks, make their decision."
