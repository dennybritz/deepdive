Sri Lanka were 46-1 after 10 overs of their World Cup semi-final
against New Zealand at Sabina Park here on Tuesday.


The winners will play either Australia or South Africa in
Saturday's final in Barbados.


Upul Tharanga was on 25 with Kumar Sangakkara on 13.


Dangerman Sanath Jayasuriya was the first man out for the 1996
champions when he was clean bowled hitting across the line off a
James Franklin delivery for just one in the third over with the
score on 13.


Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene won the toss and elected to
bat.


New Zealand welcomed back fast bowler Shane Bond and pace bowling
all-rounder Jacob Oram who missed Friday's 215-run defeat by
Australia. Off-spinner Jeetan Patel retained his place.


Sri Lanka's unorthodox fast bowler Lasith Malinga returned to the
team after three games out with ankle ligament damage and Dilhara
Fernando also returned after missing the team's last match, an
eight-wicket thrashing of minnows Ireland, with an ankle problem.


Under-pressure opening batsman Tharanga retained his place,
seeing off the challenge of the experienced Marvan Atapattu.


When the teams met in a Super Eights match in Grenada on April
12, Sri Lanka won by six wickets.
