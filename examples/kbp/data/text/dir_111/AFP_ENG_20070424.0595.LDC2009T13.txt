US stocks ended mixed Tuesday as positive earnings news helped
offset weak reports on the housing market and consumer
confidence, with the key blue-chip index flirting anew with the
13,000 level.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 35.35 points (0.27 percent)
to 12,954.75 at the closing bell after rising to an all-time
intraday high of 12,989.86.


The Nasdaq composite eked out a gain of 0.87 points (0.03
percent) to 2,524.54 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's
500 index lost 0.35 points (0.02 percent) to a preliminary close
of 1,480.58.


The market opened on an upbeat note after "several strong
earnings reports -- particularly Texas Instruments," according to
Al Goldman, market strategist at AG Edwards.


But the market wobbled after news that existing home sales fell a
sharper-than- expected 8.4 percent, the sharpest drop in 18
years, and that US consumer confidence fell to its lowest levels
in a year.


The news stoked fears of an ongoing slump in the real estate
market that will cut into consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of economic activity.


The data suggested "that the subpar growth we have been
experiencing over the past year is not likely to go away
quickly," said Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Avdisors.
