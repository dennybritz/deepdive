Damiano Cunego of the Lampre team picked up his first win of 2007
by claiming the first stage of the Tour of Trentino on Tuesday.


The 25-year-old, a winner of this race in 2004 and 2006, came in
first in 4hr 14min and 17secs, ahead of fellow Italians Enrico
Gasparetto and Stefano Garzelli.


Cunego, the Tour of Italy champion in 2004, revealed he was not
surprised by his victory.


"I have been feeling good for the past few days and I felt
confident about my chances here," he said.


"This victory proves I had good reason to be optimistic."


The second stage is a 144km ride from Santa Massenza to Predaia.
