Italy voiced "concern" Tuesday after the armed wing of the
Palestinian group Hamas declared that its five-month-old truce
with Israel is over.


Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said during a meeting with
visiting Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas that he was
"concerned by the serious negative fallout from an eventual end
to the truce in Gaza, which has been respected until now but
remains extremely fragile," a ministry statement said.


Hamas said Tuesday that it had ended a fragile truce with Israel,
firing dozens of rockets into Israel, which was celebrating the
59th anniversary of the creation of the Jewish state.


Also Tuesday, D'Alema hailed the formation of the Palestinian
unity government between Hamas and Fatah as an "important new
development."


He called on the Palestinian president to "adhere fully to the
principles set by the Quartet (the European Union, Russia, the
United Nations and the United States), in particular that
concerning explicit recognition of Israel."


Abbas arrived Monday in Rome as part of a European tour aimed at
persuading the European Union to back his unity government and
resume aid to the Palestinian Authority, suspended after Hamas
militants came to power in March 2006.


The Palestinian leader had talks with Italian President Giorgio
Napolitano as well as D'Alema, and was to meet later Tuesday with
Prime Minister Romano Prodi.


Abbas also had an audience at the Vatican with Pope Benedict XVI.
