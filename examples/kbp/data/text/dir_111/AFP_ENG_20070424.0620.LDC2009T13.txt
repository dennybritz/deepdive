Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas Tuesday said that an Israeli
soldier kidnapped in June last year by Palestinian militants was
in good health.


"According to our information, he is alive and in good health,"
the ANSA news agency quoted Abbas as saying.


Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was seized last June 25 after
Palestinian militants, including members of the armed wing of
Hamas, tunnelled out of Gaza and attacked an army border post.


Abbas arrived Monday in Rome as part of a European tour aimed at
persuading the European Union to back his unity government and
resume aid to the Palestinian Authority, suspended after Hamas
militants came to power in March 2006.


Earlier this month, Abbas said he was confident Gaza militants
would soon release Shalit.


"I would like to say that we are working to secure Shalit's
release and that these efforts will soon bear fruit. We are
optimistic. He will be released soon," Abbas told the France 24
news channel.
