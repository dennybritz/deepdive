Management at Portuguese bank BPI has spurned a takeover by rival
Millennium BCP that had been increased by close to 1.0 billion
euros, BPI said Tuesaday.


"The executive committee at BPI maintains that shareholders will
be better served if they stick to plans by BPI rather than to the
new proposal from BCP," BPI chairman Fernando Ulrich told a press
conference here.


Millennium BCP earlier in the day said it was raising its offer
to 5.32 billion euros (7.2 billion dollars), nearly a billion
euros more than its earlier bid.


BCP, which launched its bid for BPI nearly a year ago, proposed a
26 percent increase from 5.70 euros per share to 7.0 euros.


A BCP-BPI tie-up would create Portugal's leading financial
institution.


BCP currently has around three million clients and operates 900
branches, BPI, which has about 10 percent of the banking market
in Portugal, has 1.4 million clients and maintains 600 branches
throughout the country.
