A new poll released Tuesday showed Nicolas Sarkozy's lead over
Segolene Royal narrowing, with the rightwinger getting 51 percent
against 49 percent for socialist Royal.


Six other surveys released after the first round of voting on
Sunday put Sarkozy, the 52-year-old former interior minister, in
the lead with 52 percent to 54 percent of votes.


The new Sofres poll showed that Royal, the 53-year-old socialist
candidate, would get the lion's share of votes from the
electorate that backed centrist Francois Bayrou in the first
round.


Some 25 percent of Bayrou's 6.8 million voters would cast ballots
for Sarkozy compared to 46 percent for Royal, the Sofres poll
showed. The remaining 29 percent would abstain.
