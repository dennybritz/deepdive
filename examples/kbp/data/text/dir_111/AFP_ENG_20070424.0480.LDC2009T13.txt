Three senior Indian police officers were arrested in the western
state of Gujarat Tuesday on charges of murdering a Muslim man
falsely accused of plotting to kill the state's chief minister.


The arrests came after Gujarat's government admitted Sohrabuddin
Sheikh was killed in a staged gun battle in 2005.


"Deputy Inspector-General of police D.G. Vanzara and
Superintendent of Police Rajkumar Pandian have been arrested on
charges of murder," Sudhir Sinha, a senior state police officer,
told the Press Trust of India.


At the time of the killing, Vanzara was head of the anti-terror
squad and Pandian was his deputy. The third officer arrested was
also a member of the squad.


Police had claimed Sheikh belonged to the Pakistan-based militant
group Lashkar-e-Taiba and was plotting to kill Hindu nationalist
Chief Minister Narendra Modri to avenge the death of hundreds of
Muslims in communal riots in 2002.


Human rights groups have accused Modi of turning a blind eye to
the religious rioting in which they say about 2,500 people,
mostly Muslims, were killed. State records say only about 1,000
people died.
