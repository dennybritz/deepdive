Squatters in Lagos, Africa's fastest growing city, are hampering
government plans to fight a possible ocean surge due to global
warming, the Nigerian news agency (NAN) reported Tuesday.


The popular Bar Beach, which derived its name from being the old
site of public execution, is supposed to be a fun spot in a city
whose population was put at nine million by a 2006 census but is
estimated at twice that by the government.


The beach however has become home anti-social elements referred
to as "area boys" and itinerant religious worshipers.


"As reclamation work gets underway at the Lagos Bar Beach with
eviction notices served to squatters, hundreds of squatters,
including 'area boys' have  remained unmoved", the news agency
said.


The municipal administration in Lagos is giving a face-lift to
the beach but social workers are worried about the welfare of
over 5,000 squatters that are to be evicted.


A large chunk of the evictees depend on the beach for their
livelihood.


Social workers are concerned about the future of young adults who
make up 30 percent of the homeless people living on the sands of
Bar Beach.


"Some of them are already mixing up with criminals while many
others, who should be in schools, are roaming about in search of
food," Victoria Okosi, a social worker told NAN.


Okoli canvassed for a resettlement programme before the goverment
evicts the young squatters.


"We cannot be moved from here. We are land-owners here. Where do
you want us to go?" said one youngster.
