One peacekeeper died and another was seriously injured Tuesday in
a road accident in the UN-administered province of Kosovo, a KFOR
spokesman said.


The accident happened in the Istok district in the west of the
province and did not involve any other vehicle, said German
colonel Michael Knop of the NATO-led Kosovo force.


The injured soldier's life was not thought to be in danger but
his condition was serious. He said he could not release any
further details on the pair because their families had yet to be
informed.


About 17,000 KFOR peacekeepers are responsible for peace and
security in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.


Ethnic Albanian-dominated Kosovo came under the control of the
United Nations and NATO in June 1999 after a NATO bombing
campaign against Serbian forces stopped a crackdown on ethnic
Albanians.
