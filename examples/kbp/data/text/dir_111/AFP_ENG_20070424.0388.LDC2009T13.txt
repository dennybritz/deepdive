Annie Leibovitz, famous for her pictures of Hollywood
celebrities, has taken four photographic portraits of Queen
Elizabeth II to mark her visit to the United States, royal
officials said Tuesday.


"The photographs were taken at our invitation. They were taken in
the white drawing room here at the palace on March 28," a
spokeswoman for the queen told reporters at a pre-trip briefing
at Buckingham Palace, central London.


One photograph will be published on May 2, the day before the 81
-year-old monarch heads to the United States with her husband,
Prince Philip, on her first state visit there in 16 years.


The three others will be released later, including two that will
be published in the glossy Vanity Fair magazine.


The queen's visit is to mark the 400th anniversary of the first
permanent English colony in North America at Jamestown, Virginia.


Leibovitz was director of photography at rock magazine Rolling
Stone before she moved to Vanity Fair.


Her most famous subjects include Hollywood actress Demi Moore
nude and pregnant and former Beatle John Lennon, nude, hugging
his wife Yoko Ono, on the morning he was shot dead in 1980.
