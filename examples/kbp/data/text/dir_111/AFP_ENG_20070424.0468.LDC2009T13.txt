Bosnia began destroying more than 5,500 tons of dangerous
ammunition Tuesday, much of it left over from the former Yugoslav
republic's bitter 1992-1995 war, officials said.


"The small arms and mortar ammunition is to be safely destroyed
over the next 18 months" at a weapons factory outside Sarajevo,
Amna Berbic of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
told AFP.


Most of the ammunition to be destroyed was old and in poor
condition, posing a risk to citizens, while part of it was
incompatible with weapons currently used by Bosnia's armed
forces.


The governments of Britain, the Netherlands and Spain had
provided a total of 500,000 euros (680,000 dollars) in financial
support for the UNDP-led project.


The project also includes upgrading capacities for the
destruction of another 30,000 tons of surplus ammunition that
remains in stockpiles, said Berbic.


The Balkan country is struggling to cope with weapons illegally
kept by civilians.


According to official surveys, around 10,000 people have either
been killed or have committed suicide using light weapons in
Bosnia since the end of the war, which claimed up to 200,000
lives.
