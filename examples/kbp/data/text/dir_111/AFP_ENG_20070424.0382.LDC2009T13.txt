US home sales fell much more sharply than expected in March
dashing hopes of resilience in the struggling real estate market,
an industry survey showed Tuesday.


The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said existing home
sales plummeted 8.4 percent to an annualized pace of 6.12 million
last month, well below most market forecasts calling for a 6.45
million-unit sales pace.


The monthly report showed signs that lower prices -- following a
long boom in the property market that ended last year -- did not
stimulate sales last month.


The median sales price slipped 0.3 percent to 217,000 dollars.


The property market has been struggling as consumer fuel costs
have increased and speculators have pulled out of what had been a
sizzling sector.


The latest data show existing home sales are 11.3 percent below
the 6.90 million-unit pace of March 2006.
