US President George W. Bush will visit Poland on June 8 for talks
with Polish counterpart Lech Kaczynski on a defence shield
Washington wants to site in central Europe, the Polish presidency
said Tuesday.


Washington wants to site 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a
targeting radar in the Czech Republic as part of the system,
which has already been deployed in the United States, Britain and
Greenland.


Formal talks have not yet begun, but the Polish government has
expressed interest in the project.


US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates arrived in Warsaw Tuesday
from Moscow for talks aimed at getting Polish leaders to begin
formal negotiations on the missile shield.


Washington says it would be vital for defending Europe and the
United States against attacks from the Middle East, and Iran in
particular.
