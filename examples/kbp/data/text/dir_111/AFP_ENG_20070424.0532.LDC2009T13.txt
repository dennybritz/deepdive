Danish cabin crews at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) walked
off the job in a wildcat strike on Tuesday, causing major flight
disruptions, SAS Denmark said.


By 1630 GMT the airline had cancelled 62 European flights in and
out of Copenhagen.


"Further cancellations are expected," SAS spokesman Jens
Langergaard told AFP, adding that "flights with Norwegian and
Swedish flight attendants were not effected by these illegal
actions."


In March 2007, SAS was hit with a similar strike after the
airline failed to reach a collective agreement with the
1,600-member Cabin Attendants Union.


The airline could not estimate when air-traffic would be
normalised but Langegaard said "the situation is more serious
this time as the previous collective agreement negotiations with
the arbitrator already had resulted in an agreement."


According to cabin crew spokesman Niels Henrik Madsen, flight
attendants are dissatisfied with their collective agreement being
included in a private sector agreement.


"We are not interested in higher salaries but call for better
working conditions. Our company is the European company with the
lowest number of crew on flights," Madsen told Danish news agency
Ritzau.
