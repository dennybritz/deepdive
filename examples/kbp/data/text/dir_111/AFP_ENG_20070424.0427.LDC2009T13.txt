A series of explosions caused by hot weather hit ammunition
depots at a military base in central Thailand late Tuesday, the
kingdom's army chief said.


General Sonthi Boonyaratglin said that no one was killed or
injured in the blasts at two ammunition warehouses in Lopburi
province.


"The initial investigation found that the explosions were caused
by the heat," said Sonthi, who is also head of Thailand's junta.


"Everything is under control, but we will investigate further
into what the cause of the incident was," he told local
television.


He said that damage to the army base was minimal, and that the
military had evacuated everybody from the surrounding area.


April is the hottest month in Thailand, with temperatures in
Lopburi on Tuesday hitting 37 degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit).


Sonthi said he planned to visit the army base to assess the
situation.


Police in Lopburi said that blasts began at about 8:00 pm (1300
GMT) at the army depot about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the
provincial capital Lopburi.
