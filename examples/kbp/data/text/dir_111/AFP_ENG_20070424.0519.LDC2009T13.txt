Britain's finance minister Gordon Brown admitted Tuesday he was
not very good at maths.


On a visit to a school in Manchester, north-west England, a 13
-year-old boy asked Britain's likely next prime minister if you
had to be good at the subject to be chancellor of the exchequer.


Brown laughed and said: "I did maths at school and for one year
at university but I don't think I was ever very good at it -- and
some people would say it shows."


The 56-year-old had earlier greeted pupils waiting outside with
his left trouser leg tucked completely into his sock. He
corrected his dress after a whispered comment from an aide.


Brown, a history graduate from Edinburgh University who has been
finance minister for the last 10 years, is expected to take over
from Prime Minister Tony Blair in the next few months.
