China Tuesday strongly condemned an attack Tuesday on a Chinese-
run oil field in which 74 people including nine Chinese were
killed, state media said.


Foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said one Chinese person
was also slightly wounded and seven others kidnapped in the
attack by more than 200 gunmen, the official Xinhua news agency
said in a brief report.


Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing held a telephone
conversation with his Ethiopian counterpart Seyoum Mesfin, who is
on a visit to the United States, the agency said in a separate
dispatch.


"The two ministers talked on issues of common concern," it said,
quoting a foreign ministry press release.


Around 200 unidentified gunmen attacked the oil field in Somali
state where China's Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau is
searching for oil, according to a company manager quoted earlier
by Xinhua.


China has stepped up investment and exploration in African oil
fields in recent years as its appetite for energy has boomed
along with its growing economy.
