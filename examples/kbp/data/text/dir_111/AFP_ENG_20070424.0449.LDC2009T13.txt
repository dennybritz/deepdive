The widow of late Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer said Tuesday
she has been told the body of her murdered husband was ready to
be flown home for his funeral in South Africa, a report said.


Gill Woolmer said Jamaican authorities had called her to confirm
that Woolmer's body could now be flown home six weeks after being
found in his hotel room although she did not know exactly when,
reported the Cape Argus newspaper.


"It's a great relief," she said from the family's home in Cape
Town's Pinelands neighbourhood.


She had earlier said the cremation ceremony for the English-born
Woolmer would be a private family affair. A public memorial
service was held for the former South African coach in the city
earlier this month.


Woolmer, 58, was found dead in his Kingston hotel room on March
18, the day after Pakistan had crashed out of the World Cup after
an upset loss to Ireland.


Detectives launched a murder investigation after an autopsy
indicated the former England Test player had been strangled, but
they have yet to make any arrests.


An inquest had been scheduled to open on Monday, but was
postponed by the Jamaican justice ministry on advice of the
coroner. No reason was given for the delay.


Jamaica's Daily Gleaner newspaper reported on Tuesday that a
coroner had ordered Woolmer's remains to be released to his
family.
