Egyptian security officials will meet members of Palestinian
armed factions in Gaza in a bid to restore a five-month truce
with Israel which Hamas declared over on Tuesday, officials said.


According to Egyptian and Palestinian officials, the Egyptian
security delegation in the Palestinian territories, headed by
General Bourhan Hamad, will hold the meeting in Gaza City at 1130
am (0830 GMT).


The meeting will be attended by representatives of all
Palestinian factions, including the Islamic Jihad, which has
refused to abide by the November 26 truce with Israel.


The armed wing of the Hamas movement on Tuesday declared the
truce over after claiming to have fired scores of rockets into
the Jewish state on its Independence Day.


A spokesman for prime minister Ismail Haniya, a Hamas politician,
however said the government "remains bound to the truce to
preserve the interests of the Palestinian people."
