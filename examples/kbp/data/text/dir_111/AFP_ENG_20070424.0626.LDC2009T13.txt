The US state of Ohio on Tuesday executed a man convicted of
murdering his former wife, marking the 14th inmate put to death
this year in the United States.


James Filiaggi, 41, received a regime of lethal chemical
injections and was declared dead at 1523 GMT, officials at a
prison in Lucasville, Ohio said.


Filiaggi came to resent demands for child-care payments for two
daughters from his marriage to Lisa Huff, who had set up
housekeeping with another man after their 1993 divorce.


He harassed her for months and in December 1993 assaulted her,
was arrested, charged and released on bail while awaiting trial.


Late at night on January 24, 1994 Lisa Huff telephoned police and
told them her former husband was armed and trying to break down
her door.


Huff fled to a neighbor's house, but Filiaggi followed her and
killed her with multiple gunshots.


At trial, Filiaggi's lawyers presented evidence that the
defendant suffered serious mental illness to back their argument
that his life should be spared.


However, the court rejected the argument, refused to order
independent tests and let stand the death sentence.


The United States has more than 3,300 prisoners on death row.


Several US states have suspended death sentence executions as
debate grows as to whether the three-drug cocktail administered
to most condemned men violates the constitutional ban on "cruel
and unusual punishments."


Rights groups and medical advocates say the procedure is not
scientific, often faulty and may result in an agonizing end to
life.
