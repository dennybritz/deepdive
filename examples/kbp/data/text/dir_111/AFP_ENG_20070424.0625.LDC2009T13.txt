Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) announced Tuesday the
cancellation of more than 100 flights in and out of the Danish
capital after a walk-out by Danish cabin crews.


At least 104 flights to and from Copenhagen on Wednesday had been
cancelled after the wildcat strike, the airline for Denmark and
Sweden said.


"Further cancellations are expected," SAS spokesman Jens
Langergaard told AFP, adding that "flights with Norwegian and
Swedish flight attendants were not effected by these illegal
actions."


In March 2007, SAS was hit by a similar strike after the airline
failed to reach a collective agreement with the 1,600-member
Cabin Attendants Union.


The airline could not estimate when air traffic would be
normalised but Langergaard said "the situation is more serious
this time as the previous collective agreement negotiations with
the arbitrator already had resulted in an agreement."


Cabin crew spokesman Niels Henrik Madsen said flight attendants
were dissatisfied with their collective agreement being included
in a private sector agreement.


"We are not interested in higher salaries but call for better
working conditions. Our company is the European company with the
lowest number of crew on flights," Madsen told Danish news agency
Ritzau.
