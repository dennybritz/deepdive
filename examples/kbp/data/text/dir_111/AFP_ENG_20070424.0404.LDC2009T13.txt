US stocks turned lower Tuesday as Wall Street reacted to weaker-
than-expected reports on the housing market and consumer
confidence, overshadowing generally strong earnings reports.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed course after a positive
opening and fell 5.04 points (0.04 percent) to 12,914.36 at 1440
GMT.


The Nasdaq composite dropped 10.89 points (0.43 percent) to
2,512.78 and the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index added
1.46 points (0.10 percent) to 1,482.39.


The market opened on an upbeat note after "several strong
earnings reports -- particularly Texas Instruments," according to
Al Goldman, market strategist at AG Edwards.


But early momentum was sapped by news that existing home sales
fell a sharper- than-expected 8.4 percent and that US consumer
confidence fell to its lowest levels in a year.


The news stoked fears of an ongoing slump in the real estate
market that will cut into consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of economic activity.


Peter Cardillo, analyst at Avalon Partners, said the economic
data is "dampening investors' enthusiasm about the earnings
season."


"Those data were not positive and now investors are going to
focus more on the economy," he added.


In addition, Cardillo said, higher oil prices were weighing on
sentiment.


"Earnings are better than expected but it's already priced into
the market." he said.


Crude oil prices were up 19 cents at 66.08 dollars a barrel in
New York after strong gains Monday.
