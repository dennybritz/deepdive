At least 18 East African refugees who were being smuggled by boat
to Yemen have died, including eight who were killed after they
were thrown overboard in high seas, the UN refugee agency said
Tuesday.


Witnesses and survivors from two vessels which crossed the Gulf
of Aden on April 20 reported that 10 more died due to
asphyxiation and dehydration, said Jennifer Pagonis, a
spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.


One of the boats that arrived in Yemen with 140 Ethiopians and
Somalis normally transports cattle and fish. The other was
carrying 10 Somalis, Pagonis added.


The survivors each reportedly paid smugglers 100 dollars for the
crossing.


More than 5,600 immigrants have landed on the Yemeni coast this
year, according to the UNHCR.


At least 200 more have died and many are missing, an estimate
that remains unchanged since the previous reported incident on
April 6.


Last year, an estimated 26,000 mainly Somalis and Ethiopians made
the perilous crossing and at least 330 are known to have died.
