The Italian government seized real estate worth two billion euros
(2.7 billion dollars) from the mafia last year, Deputy Interior
Minister Marco Minniti said on Tuesday.


Most of the property -- plots of land, apartments, villas,
company buldings, hotels and shops -- was taken from Italy's
three big mafia networks, Cosa Nostra in Sicily, N'Drangheta in
Calabria, and Camorra in the Naples region, he told a conference
in Calabria.


"This figure illustrates the wealth of organised crime," Minniti
said.


Property seized from the mafia either goes to Italian central
government institutions or to local authorities.
