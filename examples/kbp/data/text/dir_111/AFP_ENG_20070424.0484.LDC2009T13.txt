A British-based consortium headed by former player Ray Ranson on
Tuesday launched a 90 million pounds (135million euros) takeover
bid for English Premiership side Manchester City.


Ranson confirmed reports by the Press Association earlier in the
day that he was interested in buying the club.


The former player, who made over 200 appearances for City,
outlined his proposal to the club's plc board and issued a
statement to the Stock Exchange which revealed he is yet to
receive a positive response from the club.


Ranson's approach for the club is backed by an unnamed UK-based
financial partner.


Speculation over the future ownership of City has been rife since
club chairman John Wardle opened discussions with various parties
over the sale of his 29 percent stake, which is owned jointly
with business partner David Makin.


So far there has been no sign of a deal being concluded although
an unnamed American consortium is currently seen as best placed
to complete a buyout of Wardle's shares.


Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was also linked
with a possible bid.


The Ranson offer is the first concrete proposal to be put before
Wardle and it is likely a board meeting will be quickly convened
to discuss a formal response.


If the takeover goes through, City would join a growing list of
Premiership clubs to have been bought out.


Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester United are all now
American-owned while Chelsea is owned by Russian tycoon Roman
Abramovich.
