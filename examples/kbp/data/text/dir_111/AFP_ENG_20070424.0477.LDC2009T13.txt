An elementary school was evacuated briefly on Tuesday after a
pupil showed up with a grenade, school district authorities said.


The fourth-grade student at Old Union elementary school in
Southlake, Texas brought to school "a hand grenade with a pin
still in it," the local school district said on its website.


After students, teachers and staff were evacuated to a nearby
church, a bomb disposal team removed the device and determined it
was "inactive," the Carroll independent school district said.


The pupils and school staff then returned to class later Tuesday
morning.


"All students are safe and accounted for," the district said.


Authorities said there was no sign the boy was angry or troubled.


"The boy wasn't mad at anyone," Corporal Mike Bedrich, of the
Southlake Department of Public Safety, told the Fort-Worth Star-
Telegram newspaper.


"He just thought it would be cool to bring it to school."
