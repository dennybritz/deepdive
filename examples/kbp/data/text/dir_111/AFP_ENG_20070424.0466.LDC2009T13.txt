Ecuadoran police stepped up security outside Ecuador's Congress
building Tuesday, one day after 50 recently ousted legislators
were reinstated despite objections by leftist President Rafael
Correa.


Hundreds of police officers were deployed around the Congress,
while 50 Correa supporters demonstrated outside the building to
protest the Constitutional Court's ruling reinstating the
opposition lawmakers.


Correa himself made it clear on Monday he did not accept the
decision.


The deputies were ousted in March after they sought to block far-
reaching constitutional reforms promoted by Correa.


With the lawmakers out of the 100-strong, unicameral Congress,
authorities held a referendum on April 16 that paved the way for
the election of an national assembly that will rewrite the
constitution.


Officials said the remaining seven lawmakers ousted in March were
not reinstated because they had failed to sign the proper papers.
