Canadian parliamentarians stood in silence for one minute Tuesday
to recognize the "Armenian genocide" during World War I, a
sensitive issue that hurt Canadian relations with Turkey last
year.


A spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Peter Milliken told AFP
the Conservative government's House leader and his counterparts
from all three opposition parties agreed to the official
commemoration.


Turkey said in April 2006 it was "appalled" by Canadian Prime
Minister Stephen Harper's reference to the bloodbath as the first
genocide of the 20th century, and temporarily recalled its
ambassador to Ottawa in protest.


Ankara said then Harper's comments gave support to Armenia's
"unfounded allegations of genocide" and that his position on the
issue would "negatively affect ties between Turkey and Canada."


Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kinsmen were slaughtered
in an orchestrated genocide in the final years of the Ottoman
Empire.


Turkey categorically rejects claims of genocide, arguing that
300,000 Armenians and at least as many Turks died in civil strife
when Armenians began fighting for independence in eastern
Anatolia and sided with Russian troops invading the crumbling
Ottoman Empire.
