New Zealand were 30-1 after 10 overs of their World Cup semi-
final against Sri Lanka at Sabina Park here on Tuesday chasing
290 to win.


The winners will face either Australia or South Africa in
Saturday's final.


Peter Fulton was on 14 with Ross Taylor on eight.


Captain Stephen Fleming was first man out lbw to Lasith Malinga
in the second over for one with the total on two.


Earlier, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene's 115 not out was
the centrepiece of his team's imposing total of 289 for five.


Jayawardene, who won the toss and chose to bat, faced 109 balls
and smashed three sixes and 10 fours.


Opener Upul Tharanga struck a tournament best 73 to make sure Sri
Lanka recovered well after Sanath Jayasuriya fell early on for
one.


Together with Tillakaratne Dilshan, Jayawardene put on 81 for the
fifth wicket before a rapid unbroken stand of 56 with Russel
Arnold (14 not out).


Crucially, Sri Lanka lost just one wicket to spearhead quick
Shane Bond who was returning after missing Friday's 215-run
thrashing by Australia with a stomach illness.


The fast bowler's 10 overs cost 59 runs.


Tuesday's semi-final was a repeat of the April 12 Super Eights
match in Grenada, which Sri Lanka won by six wickets.
