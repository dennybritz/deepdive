The European Union said on Friday that Iran's seizure of 15
British navy personnel was a breach of international law and
threatened to take action if they were not released soon.


EU foreign ministers meeting in Germany expressed their
"unconditional support" for the British government over the week-
old crisis and said that if the naval personnel were not released
in the near future "the EU will decide on appropriate measures."


A joint statement said: "The European Union deplores the
continued arrest of 15 British citizens... by Iran on March 23
and underlines the European Union's unconditional support for the
government of the United Kingdom.


"All evidence clearly indicates that at the time of the seizure
the British naval personnel were on a routine patrolling mission
in Iraqi waters, in accordance with UN Security Council
resolution 1723.


"The seizure of Iranian forces therefore constitutes a clear
breach of international law.


"The EU repeats its call for the immediate and unconditional
release of the British Royal Naval personnel.


"Should the UK citizens not be realeased in the near future the
EU will decide on appropriate measures."


The statement also called for Iran to inform Britain of the
whereabouts of the 14 men and one woman and to grant consular
access.


The EU statement is stronger than that of the UN Security Council
which on Thursday expressed "grave concern" at the naval
personnel's detention but declined to back Britain with a call
for their immediate release.
