Workers at Budapest airport began a one-day strike late Friday,
which could delay up to 74 flights, the airport management said
in a statement.


Some 500 ground employees are on strike as of 1700 GMT on Friday
until 1700 GMT on Saturday, after salary negotiations with
management ended in a deadlock.


"The strike affects 13 arriving and 14 departing flights on
Friday and 26 departing and 21 arriving flights on Saturday," the
airport management said.


The flights of British Airways, Swiss, Travel Service, Lufthansa,
Wizzair, Germanwings and easyJet could be delayed by the strike,
the statement said.


Workers at the fuel transport unit of Budapest airport will also
hold a seven- hour strike on Saturday, but this should not cause
delays, the airport management said.
