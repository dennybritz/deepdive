After a decade of bloody civil war, Nepal's former rebel Maoists
will be given five ministries in a new interim government,
officials said Friday.


"Today's meeting ... has informally decided to nominate the
Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala for the post of
the prime minister of the new interim government which includes
the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)," Ram Chandra Poudel,
general secretary of Nepal's largest political party, told
reporters.


A parliament sitting on Saturday morning will formalise the
Maoists' entry into government, Poudel said.


Nepal's multi-party government and Maoists signed a landmark
peace deal late last year that ended the former rebels' "people's
war," which claimed at least 13,000 lives.
