Armed men have kidnapped the head of the Guinea branch of French
oil company Total, police said Friday.


Benoit Gaborit, a French national, was abducted Thursday night
while leaving a restaurant in the centre of the Guinea capital of
Conakry, police chief Sekou Mohamed Bangoura.


He said police were pursuing the kidnappers, but declined to give
further details.


Another police source speaking on condition of anonymity said the
kidnappers had demanded a ransom for Gaborit. The source did not
provide further details, including the amount.


The kidnappers, who stopped Gaborit's vehicle outside the
restaurant, spoke in English, according to the police source.
Guinea is a former French colony.


Kidnappings for ransom are rare in Guinea. But armed attacks have
become more frequent following civil wars in neighbouring
countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast.
