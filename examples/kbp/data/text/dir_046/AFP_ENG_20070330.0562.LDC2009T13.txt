Kam-Po Wong of Hong Kong won the men's scratch crown after the
crash-marred final here at the track cycling world championships
on Friday.


Wong crossed the finish line after 15km of frantic racing to
leave Rafal Ratajczyk of Poland in second place and Czech rider
Martin Blaha picking up the bronze.


The race was marred by a crash just before the final lap, which
took down around eight riders - all of whom failed to get up and
most of whom required medical attention.


It is the first ever world title in track cycling for a rider
from Hong Kong.
