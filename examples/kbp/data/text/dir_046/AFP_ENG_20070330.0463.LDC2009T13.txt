The EU agreed on Friday to call for the immediate release of the
15 British navy personnel being held in Iran, saying their
detention was a breach of international law, an EU source said.


EU foreign ministers meeting in Germany will express their
"unconditional support" for the British government over the week-
old crisis, the source said.
