Three journalists detained since January for accusing the
president of the breakaway republic of Somaliland of corruption
have been freed, Reporters Without Borders said on Friday.


In a statement, the campaign group said Yusuf Abdi Gabobe, the
publisher of Somaliland's privately-owned daily Haatuf, its
editor Ali Abdi Dini and one of its journalists Mohamed Omar
Sheikh Ibrahim were released late on Thursday.


The journalists were arrested in January over an article in which
they said government jobs were being reserved for cronies of
President Dahir Riyale Kahin and government vehicles were being
used for personal business.


Dini and Ibrahim were each sentenced to 29 months in jail earlier
in March.


Somaliland seceded from Somalia in May 1991 and is still seeking
international recognition.
