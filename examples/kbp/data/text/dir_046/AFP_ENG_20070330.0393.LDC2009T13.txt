Two Ethiopian soldiers died when their helicopter was shot down
by insurgents over Mogadishu on Friday, the African Union
peacekeeping force in Somalia said.


The Mi-24 gunship was hit by a missile and came down on waste
ground in Mogadishu airport, just 500 metres (550 yards) from a
base of Ugandan AU peacekeepers, Captain Paddy Ankunda told AFP
by telephone.


"It came down and there was nothing we could do. We saw it hit
the ground. We saw a fire and we moved in to see. It crashed into
the ground," he said.


"Our troops managed to secure the wreckage as well as taking away
the bodies. Only two bodies were recovered."


The helicopter was destroyed as joint Ethiopian and Somali forces
came under fire from Islamist insurgents during a second day of
intensive fighting sparked by an Ethiopian offensive.


"The war is continuing," said Ankunda, adding that Ugandan
peacekeeping troops were remaining in defensive positions.


"African troops have not been involved in any fighting. We are
not about to get involved in any fighting because our mandate
does not allow us to do that."


Some 1,500 Ugandan peacekeeping forces are deployed in Mogadishu.
