Britain's biggest commercial broadcaster ITV and Irish pay-TV
operator Setanta Sports have secured rights to screen live FA Cup
and England home internationals, England's Football Association
said Friday.


The FA said the two broadcasters had won the bidding for a four-
year deal from August 2008, worth 425 million pounds (626 million
euros, 834 million dollars).


The pair have snatched the live rights away from Britain's public
broadcaster, the BBC, and pay-satellite television group BSkyB.


FA chief executive Brian Barwick said his organisation was
"delighted" with the new TV rights deal, which he added would
provide more investment for football at all levels.


The contract is also a coup for new ITV executive chairman
Michael Grade, who recently departed the BBC to head the
commercial broadcaster.


"ITV is pleased to be returning both the FA Cup and England games
to our viewers and advertisers," Grade said.
