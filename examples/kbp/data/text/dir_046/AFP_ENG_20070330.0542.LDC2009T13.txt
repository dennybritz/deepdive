The kidnapped head of the Guinea branch of French oil company
Total has been found safe and well, police said on Friday.


Benoit Gaborit, a French national, "is currently with the police,
as are his kidnappers," police chief Sekou Mohamed Bangoura said.


There are as yet no details on how Gaborit was found, or on the
number and nationality of his kidnappers.


The Total chief was abducted by armed men on Thursday night while
leaving a restaurant in the centre of the Guinea capital of
Conakry.


A police source speaking on condition of anonymity said the
kidnappers had demanded a ransom for Gaborit, but did not provide
further details.


The kidnappers, who stopped his vehicle outside the restaurant,
spoke in English, according to the police source.


Kidnappings for ransom are rare in the former French colony. But
armed attacks have become more frequent following civil wars in
neighbouring countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and the
Ivory Coast.
