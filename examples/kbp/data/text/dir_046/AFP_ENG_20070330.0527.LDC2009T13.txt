Giant petroleum producer Iran plans to stop pricing its oil in
dollars, the state-run television quoted the central bank
governor as saying on Friday.


"Iran plans to stop selling its oil in dollars," Ebrahim Sheibani
was quoted as saying, adding that Iran had reduced its assets
held in dollars to 20 percent.


The report did not give further details.


Iran said in December it would replace the dollar with the euro
in foreign transactions and state-held foreign assets, in an
apparent response to mounting US pressure on its banking system.


Iran is under UN sanctions over its refusal to halt sensitive
nuclear work. The sanctions, targeting its nuclear and missile
programmes, include a freeze on assets for people involved in
these programmes.
