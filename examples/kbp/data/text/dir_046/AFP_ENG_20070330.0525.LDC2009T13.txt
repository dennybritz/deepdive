A mere three seconds split defending world champion Sebastien
Loeb and arch- rival Marcus Gronholm after the second day's
action in the Rally of Portugal here on Friday.


Gronholm, a dual former world champion, won Thursday's super
special and added two more stage wins on Friday but the Finn was
still left trailing his French foe, who picked up stages four,
six and seven, by 3.1s.


Gronholm's Ford Focus teamamate and compatriot Mikko Hirvonen is
lying third, 25.3s adrift with Subaru Impreza driver Petter
Solberg fourth a further seven seconds off the pace.


"It's a real close fight," said Ford technical director Christian
Loriaux.


"Seb's got the edge for consistency this afternoon but it's a
long way from being over yet," he added.


According to Gronholm there was only one explanation for his
second-place position.


"It's simple, Seb was just a little quicker," said the veteran 39
-year-old, whose cause was not helped when he shed 10 seconds
after hitting an ill-placed bump on the road in the fourth stage.


"The car landed on its nose, the windscreen cracked and the shock
absorber packed up," he reported.


Loeb for his part was feeling the heat of the battle.


"It's been a very hard day," said Citroen's defending world
champion.


"We were going head to head with Gronholm, you have to take every
risk to get in front.


"We've got a three second advantage over him, it's not enormous
but at least we're leading."
