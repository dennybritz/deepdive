US President George W. Bush will welcome Peruvian President Alan
Garcia for talks on April 23, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino
said in a statement Friday.


"This visit will underscore the friendship and cooperation
between the United States and Peru, and will be an opportunity
for the president to continue to build on the relationship with a
key regional partner who is committed to democracy," said Perino.


"The two leaders will discuss continuing cooperation in areas of
mutual interest, including the importance of free trade to
sustained economic growth, job creation, and prosperity," she
said.
