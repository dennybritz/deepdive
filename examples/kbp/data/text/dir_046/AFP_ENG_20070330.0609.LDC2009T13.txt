A former vice-president in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Jean-Pierre Bemba, who has sought refuge in the South African
embassy following recent clashes, may fly to Portugal this
weekend for health reasons, diplomatic sources said on Friday.


"There are a few details to sort out but we think that his
evacuation, together with his family, could happen this weekend,"
a source in the Portuguese embassy in Kinshasa said.


The source added, however, that his trip was for medical
treatment and that Bemba has not applied for political asylum in
Portugal.


Bemba, a former warlord and former vice-president, would be in
Portugal for "several weeks" for treatment on a leg injury having
undergone an operation at a Lisbon hospital in December, the
source said.


Bemba has been holed up at the South African embassy in Kinshasa
since violent clashes between his supporters and government
troops on March 22-23 in which 163 people were killed.


Talks on arranging an evacuation have been going on for four days
between Bemba, Congolese, South African and Portuguese
authorities, as well as the UN mission in DRC.


"Everyone wants him to leave, for things to calm down and that we
can at last get to work on reconstruction of this country," a
ministerial ally of President Joseph Kabila said.
