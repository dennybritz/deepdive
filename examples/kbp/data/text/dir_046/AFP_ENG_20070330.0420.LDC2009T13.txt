The International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday that it
deplored the heavy civilian toll in the worst fighting in the
Somali capital Mogadishu for 15 years.


Most of the 229 wounded admitted to the city's main Keysaney and
Medina hospitals in the 24 hours since Thursday morning were
civilians, including women and children, the ICRC said in a
statement.


"The population of Mogadishu is caught up in the worst fighting
in more than 15 years. The ICRC deplores the high number of
civilian casualties," the Geneva- based humanitarian agency said
in a statement.


"It urgently calls on all parties to respect the rules of
international humanitarian law and take all feasible precautions
to spare civilians and their property," it added.


The ICRC delivers medical and surgical supplies to the hospitals,
which have admitted over 1,000 war-wounded since the beginning of
the year.


At least 38 people were killed in the outbreak of heavy fighting
sparked by an Ethiopian offensive on insurgents in Mogadishu on
Thursday, local sources said.
