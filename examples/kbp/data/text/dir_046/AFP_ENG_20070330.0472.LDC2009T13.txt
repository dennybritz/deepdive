The EU agreed on Friday to call for the immediate release of the
15 British navy personnel being held in Iran, saying their
detention was a breach of international law, EU sources said.


EU foreign ministers meeting in Germany will express their
"unconditional support" for the British government over the week-
old crisis,the sources said.


The finalised statement, to be released shortly, will call for
the "immediate release" of the 14 sailors and said their seizure
was a "breach of international law," the two sources said.


The text will say that "all the evidence" indicates that the
British personnel were in Iraqi waters and had not crossed into
Iranian territorial waters when they were detained by Iran last
Friday, one of the sources said.


The EU statement is stronger than that of the UN Security Council
which on Thursday expressed "grave concern" at the naval
personnel's detention but declined to back Britain with a call
for their immediate release.
