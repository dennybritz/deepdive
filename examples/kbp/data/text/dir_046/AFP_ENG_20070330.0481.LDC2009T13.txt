A British secretary sacked for blogging on the job under the
pseudonym of "La Petite Anglaise" has won a compensation claim
case against the Paris office of British accounting firm Dixon
Wilson.


A Paris labour tribunal, or "prud'hommes", ruled on Thursday that
the firm pay Catherine Sanderson, 34, 44,000 euros (58,800 US
dollars), tantamount to a year's salary, following her dismissal
last April for alleged misconduct.


Sanderson's blog about daily life built up a sizeable
international following, with many people reading her diary-style
accounts about work, relationships and the travails of single-
motherhood.


"I'm so relieved that good sense has prevailed," Sanderson told
AFP on Friday.


The reasons behind the tribunal's decision in the case, one of
the first of its kind in France, will be released in two weeks.


Sanderson said managers had discovered from reading the blog that
on two occasions she had lied about having nanny problems to take
the afternoon off. They also objected to her using the computer
in office hours to write the blog.


"I always felt that my dismissal was an unnecessarily harsh
sanction and clearly the prud'hommes shared my view,"she said.


Dixon Wilson, which offers tax and financial advice to private
clients in Britain and France, refused to comment on Friday. The
company has a month to appeal.
