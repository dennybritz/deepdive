Australian terror detainee David Hicks agreed on Friday to
withdraw charges he was abused while held by the United States as
part of a plea deal that limits his prison term to seven years.


US Military judge Colonel Ralph Kohlmann asked Hicks if he agreed
that he had "never been illegally treated by any persons in the
control or custody of the United States" during his detention in
Afghanistan and subsequent transfer to the Guantanamo Bay prison
camp.


Hicks replied, "yes."


Hicks had previously alleged he was beaten during his detention
by US forces before arriving at Guantanamo in 2002. He had also
alleged he had been sedated before learning of the charges
against him.
