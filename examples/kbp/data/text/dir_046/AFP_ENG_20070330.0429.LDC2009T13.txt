The exodus of Scottish players continued Friday when wing Rory
Lamont and hooker Scott Lawson signed for English premiership
club Sale from Glasgow on two-year deals.


"Both these players will be excellent additions to my squad for
the next two years at least," said Sale director of Rugby
Philippe Saint-Andre.


"Rory is a proven try-scoring wing and Scott is an exciting young
hooker.


"We will be announcing more signings in the coming weeks as we
strive to get back to challenging at the top of the Guinness
Premiership."


The departues of Lamont - younger brother of Northampton wing
Sean - and Lawson brings the number of players quitting
Scotland's professional sides into double figures.


Two other Glasgow players - prop Euan Murray, who is joining
Northampton - and scrum-half Graeme Beveridge (Bristol) have
already agreed moves south of the border.


Edinburgh have bade farewell to Al Strokosch and Ally Dickinson
(Gloucester), flanker Simon Taylor (Stade Francais), lock Scott
Murray (Montauban) and centre Rob Dewey (Ulster).


Wing Simon Danielli has also joined Ulster from the Borders.
