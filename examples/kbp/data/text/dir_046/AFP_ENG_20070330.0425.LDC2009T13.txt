A Saudi prisoner at the US "war on terror" camp in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, said he had confessed under torture, according to a
report released Friday by the Defense Department.


Abdel Rahim al-Nachiri, suspected to have been the mastermind
behind the 2002 attack of the USS Cole off Yemen, testified
before a US military tribunal to determine his status as an
"enemy combatant" on March 14.


"The detainee states that he was tortured into confession and
once he made a confession his captors were happy and they stopped
torturing him. Also, the detainee states that he made up stories
during the torture in order to get it to stop," the Pentagon
report said.
