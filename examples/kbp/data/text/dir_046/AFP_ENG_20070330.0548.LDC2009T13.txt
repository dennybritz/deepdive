A French runner died in Morocco of a cardiac arrest while
competing in the Maratrhon des Sables, organisers said on Friday.


Bernard Jule, 49, was found dead in his tent on Thursday morning
at Jebl Kfiroune in the south east of the country.


He was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Errachidia where a
post mortem confirmed the cause of death.


The Marathon des Sables is considered to be the toughest foot
race in the world, covering a distance equivalent to six
marathons over six days through the southern Moroccan desert.


It was due to finish on Saturday with nine-time winner Lahcen
Ahansal of Morocco well placed to complete a tenth victory,
carrying a 14-minute advantage over his brother Mohamed into the
final day.
