A 110-year old Saudi man has taken a second wife because his
first 85-year-old wife no longer satisfies his needs, the daily
Arab News said on Friday.


The report did not explain why the man considered his current
wife to be unfulfilling, but it did point out that his new spouse
is only 30 years old.


Under Islamic law, men are allowed to have as many as four wives,
as long as they can support them and provide for them equally.


A 70-year-old son of the unnamed man, from the southern city of
Baha, said his father was in good health and that his family was
thrilled at the news of the latest nuptials.
