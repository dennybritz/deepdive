Hundreds of people were evacuated from the town hall of the Czech
Republic's second city, Brno, on Friday after a suspicious
suitcase, possibly containing explosives, was found, police said.


"About 400 people had to leave... Police dogs detected an
explosive," Brno police spokeswoman Andrea Prochazkova told AFP.


Experts were analyzing the substance to establish how harmful it
could have been, she added.


A Czech pensioner planted at least 18 home-made explosive devices
throughout the country between 1999 and 2002 targeting railway
lines and memorials.


The man committed suicide in January 2003 when surrounded by
police. His motives were never known.
