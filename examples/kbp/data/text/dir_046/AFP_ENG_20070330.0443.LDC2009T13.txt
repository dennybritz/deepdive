Celtic League outfit Cardiff Blues have signed two new scrum-
halves for next season following the departure of Mike Phillips
for Ospreys.


Former New Zealand A international Jason Spice, 32, will make the
move from Ospreys, and former Wales Under-21 international Richie
Rees, 23, returns home after a year in England with London Irish.


"Having another two quality players such as Jason and Richie join
us will be a welcome boost to our squad," said Blues chief
executive Robert Norster.


"Jason brings with him a vast amount of experience and a
considerable skill set whilst Richie is regarded as one of the
most promising young Welsh talents around."


Spice has largely been used as back-up for Justin Marshall at the
Ospreys this season, while Rees has started just six games for
the Exiles.
