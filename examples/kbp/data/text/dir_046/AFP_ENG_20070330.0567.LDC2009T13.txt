The Norwegian appeal court upheld on Friday the convictions of
two men for the spectacular 2004 heist of the expressionist
masterpiece "The Scream".


The court also found a third man, who had been cleared in an
earlier trial, guilty of taking part in the theft, after
prosecutors appealed the decision. A further three men were
cleared.


"The Scream" and another painting by Edvard Munch, "Madonna",
were snatched from Oslo's Munch Museum in August 2004 in a daring
daytime raid by two armed masked robbers.


The court found Stian Skjold, the man cleared at the earlier
trial, was one of the two robbers, his accomplice, Petter
Tharaldesn, was the chauffeur and Bjoern Hoen was one of the
brains behind the heist.


Their sentences will be announced at a later date.


Investigators believe they have identified the second masked man
who took part in the raid but say he died in November from a
heroin overdose. His name has not been released and he was never
charged.


Oslo police recovered the works in August last year. The
circumstances of their recovery and whereabouts while stolen
remain shrouded in mystery. The paintings are currently being
restored.
