The United States announced in an unprecedented move Friday to
impose penalty tariffs on China to offset government subsidies,
as it grapples with a massive trade deficit with the world's most
populous nation.


Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez told a news conference that a
"preliminary decision" had been made "to apply the US anti-
subsidy law to imports from China."


This is the first time countervailing duties will be imposed on
imports from a non-market economy.


It alters a 23-year-old policy of not applying the countervailing
duty law to nonmarket economy countries.


"China's economy has developed to the point that we can add
another trade remedy tool, such as the countervailing duty law,"
Gutierrez said. "The Bush administration will continue to
vigorously enforce US trade law with respect to China," he said.


Friday decision followed a case brought by a US firm NewPage
Corp., which contended that imports of high-gloss paper from
China represented unfair competition to US-made paper.


The Commerce Department determined that Chinese producers and
exporters of coated free sheet paper received "countervailable
subsidies" of up to 20.35 percent.


Subsidies are financial assistance from foreign governments that
benefit production, manufacture, or export of goods.


President George W. Bush has been under increasing pressure from
the Democratic- controlled Congress to take bold steps to address
the soaring US trade deficit with China, that ballooned to more
than 200 billion dollars last year.
