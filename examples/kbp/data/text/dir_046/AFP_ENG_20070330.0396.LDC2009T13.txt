A British charity said Friday that the Ugandan army killed 66
children during military operations against tribal warriors in
the northeast of the country last month.


Save the Children met 256 people whose accounts indictated that
the children were either shot at, run over by armoured vehicles
or trampled upon by animals during a February 12 clash in the
remote Karamoja region, a statement said.


"Interviewees also reported that landmines were subsequently
laid, creating on- going risks for children," it said.


The Ugandan military rejected the accusations.


Army spokesman Major Felix Kulaije said the army was concerned
with protecting lives and they would not have killed children.


"That report is terribly outrageous. It is shocking for us in the
military that someone has the audacity to write such things," he
said.


The charity called for a full international and independent
inquiry into the events.


"I was today summoned by the defence minister who wanted to
discuss the report with me and they confirmed that there were
clashes on that day, but could not confirm whether children were
killed," Valter Tinderholt, Save the Children country director in
Uganda, told AFP.


"They have agreed to institute an investigation into the matter
to find out what took place," he added.


Karamoja has been plagued by inter-tribal clashes for years,
often involving sophisticated weaponry. The government launched a
disarmament drive in the area in 2000 but the programme has
attracted criticism for heavy-handedness.
