A Spanish court ruled on Friday that a new political party
created by the political wing of the Basque separatist group ETA
cannot hold a meeting this weekend to unveil its platform.


Batasuna announced earlier this week that it had created a new
political party to contest local elections in May. Batasuna
itself is banned from taking part on account of its failure to
formally break with ETA's armed campaign.


The Spanish court ruled that since the new party, Abertzale
Sozialisten Batasuna, appeared to be just a "continuation" of
Batasuna, the meeting could not go ahead.


Batasuna was banned in 2003 by the Spanish Supreme Court
following its refusal to break with ETA. The government has said
it can only take part in the May elections if it gave an
unequivocal statement disowning the armed struggle.
