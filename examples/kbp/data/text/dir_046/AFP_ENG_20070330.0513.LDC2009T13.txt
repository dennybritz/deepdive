Swiss pharmaceutical group Novartis announced Friday that it was
reviewing its financial outlook for 2007 after US sales of a key
drug were suspended owing to health concerns.


Novartis said in a statement that it was suspending US marketing
and sales of the anti-constipation drug Zelnorm in response to a
request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).


Zelnorm is the 12th biggest seller for the company and the US
market is crucial for the drug.


Some 488 million dollars out of the 561 million dollar global
sales of the drug last year took place in the United States,
according to Novartis's annual results for 2006.


The FDA's request followed retrospective analysis of clinical
trial data of 11,614 people indicating 13 cases of cardiovascular
problems among patients taking the drug, it added.


The Swiss group said it had revised its outlook for net sales
growth in 2007 and was evaluating the impact on its annual
operating and net income results.


The drug produced by Novartis is used to treat some types of
Irritable Bowel Syndrome.


Novartis said it was in discussions with the FDA to evaluate the
best way to make the drug available to "appropriate" US patients.


Zelnorm received full US regulatory approval for under 65 year-
olds in 2004. It is also approved in 49 other countries.


Novartis said it was also in discussion with health authorities
in other countries where the drug is available to determine the
next steps.
