Energy-rich Azerbaijan plans to begin selling gas to the European
Union by the end of this year, President Ilham Aliyev said
Friday.


"Some gas will be exported to Europe through the South Caucasus
Pipeline by the end of the year," Aliyev said after a meeting
with his Polish counterpart, Lech Kaczynski.


"We are very interested in the European market," Aliyev said.


The South Caucasus Pipeline, also known as the Baku-Tbilisi-
Erzurum pipeline, links Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas fields with
eastern Turkey, allowing for further exports to Europe. The
pipeline began deliveries in December.


Europe, which depends on Russia for 20 percent of its gas, is
seeking alternative energy sources.


Kaczynski's visit to Azerbaijan followed a meeting Thursday with
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev in Astana to discuss oil
deliveries to Poland.


Kaczynski said he was inviting the presidents of Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Georgia and Ukraine to an energy summit in Warsaw in
May.
