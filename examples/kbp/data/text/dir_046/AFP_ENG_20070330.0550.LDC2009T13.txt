Russia urged the United Nations on Friday to prepare an
independent report on Iran's seizure of 15 British navy
personnel, the day after the UN Security Council expressed its
"grave concern."


"The current situation demands an in-depth study into the
incident, taking into account the conflicting accounts of London
and Tehran, as well as the coordinates presented by both parties
about where (the 15) were found," the Russian foreign ministry
said in a statement.


Iran says the 14 men and one woman it seized in the northern Gulf
a week ago were in its territorial waters, but Britain says they
were picked up during a routine patrol of Iraqi waters.


"Given that Britain insists that its servicemen were fulfilling a
UN Security Council mandate, we believe the secretariat of the UN
should prepare an independent report into the incident," said
Alexandre Yakovenko, the deputy Russian foreign minister,
according to the statement.


The British ambassador to Russia visited Yakovenko on Friday at
the foreign diplomat's request, the statement said, and promised
that Britain would provide all the necessary information to the
UN.


On Thursday, the UN Security Council issued a statement
expressing "grave concern" at the detention of the British
personnel but rejected London's request that it call for their
immediate release.
