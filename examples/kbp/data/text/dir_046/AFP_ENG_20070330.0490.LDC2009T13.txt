The Swiss pharmaceutical group Novartis on Friday announced that
it was reviewing its financial outlook for 2007 after sales of an
anti-constipation drug in the United States were suspended due to
health concerns.


Novartis said in a statement that it was suspending US marketing
and sales of the drug, "Zelnorm" in response to request from the
US Food and Drug Administration.


The FDA's request followed retrospective analysis of clinical
trial data of 11,614 people indicating 13 cases of cardiovascular
problems among patients taking the drug, it added.


The Swiss group said it had revised its outlook for net sales
growth in 2007 and was evaluating the impact on its annual
operating and net income results.


The drug produced by Novartis is used to treat some types of
Irritable Bowel Syndrome.


Novartis said it was in discussions with the FDA to evaluate the
best way to make the drug available to "appropriate" US patients.


"Zelnorm" received full US regulatory approval for under 65 year-
olds in 2004. It is also approved in 49 other countries.
