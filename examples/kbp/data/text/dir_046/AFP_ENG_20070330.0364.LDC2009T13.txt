The EU Commissioner for transport Jacques Barrot appealed on
Friday for Greece to do more to reduce the numbers of dead on its
roads.


While welcoming the "progess that Greece has made on road
security" Barrot said it was essential that all Greeks make "an
effort reduce the number of deaths" on the road.


Barrot was speaking after meeting the Greek transport minister
Michalis Liapis who recognised the need to take "many more steps
to reduce mortality on the roads".


Greece has one of the highest road death tolls in the European
Union. Only Portugal, Lithuania and Latvia have worse records
according to a recent report by the Greek association of
engineers.


In 2006, 1,629 people died on Greek roads, an increase of 0.9
percent despite a decrease in the number of actual accidents.


The figures have been stable since 2003 when the government
launched a series of initiatives to reduce road traffic
accidents. Experts blame bad roads, bad drivers and a lack of
traffic police for the poor record.
