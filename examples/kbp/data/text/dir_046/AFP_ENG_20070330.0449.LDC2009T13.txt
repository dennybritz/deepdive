Nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz will sail Monday to
support US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US Navy said,
amid a spike in tensions over Iran's seizure of 15 British
marines and sailors.


The Nimitz, and its battle group of destroyers and guided missile
cruisers, will relieve the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which this
week took part in war games exercises in the Gulf with another
carrier, USS John S Stennis.


The new battle group will be in position by late-to-mid April,
but there will be no overlap with the Eisenhower, and the number
of US carriers in the area would stay at two, a navy official
said on condition of anonymity.


"If anything, there would be a point where there is only one in
the region," the official said, on condition of anonymity.


The Stennis and the Eisenhower wound down their show of force
involving 15 warships in the Gulf on Thursday.


The two carrier deployment in the Gulf was the highest level US
naval presence in the key strategic channel since the US invasion
of Iraq in March 2003.


The Nimitz will support operations in Iraq, the Horn of Africa
and Afghanistan, the navy said in a press release.


The Stennis had been operating in the Indian Ocean and the
Arabian Sea but entered Gulf waters on Tuesday, escorted by the
guided-missile carrier USS Antietam, the Fifth Fleet said.
