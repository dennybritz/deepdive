Tenth seeded Novak Djokovic routed Andy Murray 6-1, 6-0 in
Friday's semi-finals of the 6.9 million dollar ATP/WTA Sony
Ericsson Open.


It marked the second time in the last two weeks that Djokovic
coasted past the Scottish teen in the semi-finals of an ATP
Masters Series event.


The Serb also cruised to a straight-sets victory in the last
meeting between the 19-year-olds at the Indian Wells semis.


This one could not have been much easier as Djokovic needed just
62 minutes to dismiss Murray, who was lethargic throughout.


Djokovic advanced to Friday's semis thanks to a hard-fought upset
of second seed Rafael Nadal in Wednesday's quarter-finals.


He picked up where he left off two days later, converting 71
percent of his first serves while breaking Murray five times.


Murray was coming off an easy win in the quarters against
American Andy Roddick, who retired in the first set with an
apparent hamstring injury.


The young Brit looked completely lost Friday, committing five
double faults to fall to 0-3 lifetime against Djokovic.


Djokovic now will face either either No. 7 Ivan Ljubicic of
Croatia or unseeded upstart Guillermo Canas in the final.


The highest remaining seed in the depleted men's draw, Ljubicic
defeated No. 23 Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina, 6-3, 7-5, in
Thursday's quarters to reach an ATP semi-final for the fourth
time this season.
