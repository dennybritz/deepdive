Detroit Tigers lefthander Kenny Rogers underwent surgery Friday
to remove a blood clot in his left shoulder and will be sidelined
indefinitely.


The operation came one day after the 42-year-old Rogers was
placed on the disabled list with what the team referred to as "a
tired arm."


But the injury clearly was more serious, as the 18-year Major
League Baseball veteran needed a procedure to remove the clot and
also to repair two arteries in his shoulder.


Although they did not release a timetable for Rogers' return, the
Tigers announced their ace lefthander would not resume throwing
for at least six weeks.
