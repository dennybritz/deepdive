The White House said Friday that free trade talks between the
United States and South Korea "aren't going well" and will not
yield agreement absent major progress in the next few hours.


"The talks aren't going well, and unless the negotiations show
some signs of significant progress in the next few hours this
agreement will most likely not come together," spokeswoman Dana
Perino told reporters.
