The Belgian government decided on Friday to extend the mission of
its 375 UN peacekeepers in Lebanon for another six months,
Defence Minister Andre Flahaut said.


"The Belgian government had planned on a first mandate of six-
months that could be renewed once, which it did today," Flahaut
told AFP.


"Since the first contingent arrived in November, our soldiers can
stay until the end of October," he added.


The peacekeepers are Belgium's contribution to a UN force
monitoring a ceasefire that ended last year's war between Israel
and the Lebanese Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah.


Since the 34-day conflict, the UN force has been beefed up to
12,997 peacekeeping soldiers from 30 countries, including 11,302
ground troops and 1,695 naval personnel.


Flahaut said that "the make-up of the Belgian contingent will be
reviewed in April depending on the UN's needs on the grounds."


"We'll see if there is a need, for example, for more or less
anti-mine experts or other specialised units," he said.


In August, the government is to consider extending the mission
beyond the originally planned 12 months "in light of developments
in Lebanon" and regardless of the results of Belgian legislative
elections in June, Flahaut said.
