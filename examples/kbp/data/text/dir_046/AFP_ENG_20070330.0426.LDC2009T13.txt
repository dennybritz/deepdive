The United States announced Friday that it would impose penalty
tariffs on China to offset government subsidies as it grapples
with a massive trade deficit with the world's most populous
nation.


Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez told a news conference that a
"preliminary decision" had been made "to apply the US anti-
subsidy law to imports from China."
