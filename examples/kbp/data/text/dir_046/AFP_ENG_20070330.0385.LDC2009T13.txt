Taliban militants Friday freed the principal of a high school who
was kidnapped four days ago for stopping the rebels recruiting
his students, his family said.


Farid Mehsud, principal of the Oxford Public School in Tank,
which borders the restive South Waziristan tribal region, and his
brother Humayun were abducted by about a dozen gunmen from his
house on Tuesday.


The previous day a militant leader and a policeman were killed in
a clash outside the school after police called by Mehsud
prevented the Taliban entering to recruit young men to fight in
Afghanistan.


"I have received a telephone call from a tribal jirga (council of
elders) that both of them have been released," their brother
Khurshid told reporters in Tank.


The release was negotiated by an eight-member council led by a
local cleric, he said.


A council member told him that Farid and Humayun had been handed
over to the jirga and they would reach Tank late Friday, Khurshid
said but gave no further details.


Tank, which adjoins the troubled tribal region of South
Waziristan, remained under curfew for a third day Friday due to a
round of violence sparked by the incident at the school.


Officials reported no further clashes there Friday.


Analysts said the incident at the school was further proof of the
increasing Talibanisation of parts of Pakistan.
