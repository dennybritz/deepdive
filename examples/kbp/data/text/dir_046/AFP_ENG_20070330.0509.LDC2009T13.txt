Belgium moved on Friday towards officially recognizing Buddhism,
which would allow for the state to pay salaries and pensions for
people who conduct service, the Justice Ministry said on Friday.


Under a draft bill adopted on Friday, Buddhism would gain
official recognition alongside Catholicism, Protestantism,
Anglicanism, Judaism, Islam, Orthodox Christianity and "organised
secularism," the ministry said in a statement.


The move comes after the ministry "turned up no obstacles" to
official recognition following a request from the Belgian
Buddhists Union, which represents the religion's followers.


Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx said that Belgian Buddhism was
"organised" in Belgium with its practioners thought to number in
the tens of thousands.


Onkelinx, who ruled out the possibility of giving official
recognition to Scientology, also said that Buddhism "poses no
danger and has never been target by criminal cases" in Belgium.


It will now be up to the Belgian Buddhists Union to set up a
structure so that it can get formal recognition, opening the way
for public aid, which could be included in the Justice Ministry's
budget starting next year.
