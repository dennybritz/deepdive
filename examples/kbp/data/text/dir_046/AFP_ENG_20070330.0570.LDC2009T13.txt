New York Knicks' Quentin Richardson underwent successful surgery
Thursday to repair a bad back, the National Basketball
Association club announced.


Richardson has not played in over two weeks for the injury-
riddled Knicks, who are in a playoff race.


The team did not release a timetable for Richardson's return but
did say the veteran sharpshooter is expected to make a full
recovery.


The 1.95 metre (6ft 6in) Richardson has appeared in 49 games - 47
starts - this season, averaging 13.0 points and 7.2 rebounds. He
has been sidelined since March 14.
