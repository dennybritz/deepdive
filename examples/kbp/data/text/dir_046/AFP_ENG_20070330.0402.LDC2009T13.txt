Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica will attend a UN
Security Council session next week due to debate proposals for
the final status of Serbia's Kosovo province, his office said on
Friday.


In a statement his office said that "persons in charge of the
state and the members of the team of negotiators continue their
intense diplomatic activities aiming at defending the national
interests of Serbia in Kosovo."


Kostunica fervently opposes plans to give Kosovo independence
under international supervision as proposed by UN envoy Martti
Ahtisaari following a year of largely fruitless negotiations
between Belgrade and Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.


Ahtisaari's plans were presented to the security council earlier
this week. He is expected to brief council members on his
proposals at a meeting on Tuesday.


On Wednesday, Kostunica, who has headed a caretaker government
since January elections, said his country's top priority was to
ensure the failure of the Ahtisaari plan.


He also criticised the West and NATO for trying to "carve up
Serbia" while presenting themselves as "friends" of the country.


Kosovo has been under UN management since NATO bombing in 1999
helped to drive out Serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on
ethnic Albanians.


The United States and European Union hope the UN Security Council
will approve the Ahtisaari status plan later this year.


However, veto-wielding Russia has called for more efforts to find
a compromise between the leaderships of Serbia and Kosovo's
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
