New York authorities are to offer incentives to poor families for
making sure children go to school and visit the dentist, under a
new program unveiled by Mayor Michael Bloomberg.


The Opportunity NYC program, a public-private initiative
supported by philanthropic and social groups including the
Rockefeller Foundation, is due to launch in September among 2,500
lower income families.


Families can earn between 50 and 300 dollars for completing
activities and meeting educational, health and employment targets
based on measures such as school attendance and regular medical
checkups.


"If you're serious about tackling poverty, an entrenched problem
that has proven resistant to conventional government programs,
you have to be serious about trying new things," Bloomberg said
in a statement.


"Conditional cash transfer programs have proven effective in
countries around the world and, frankly, we need some new ideas
here in New York City to fight poverty," he added.


It is estimated that families involved in the program could earn
an extra 3,000 to 5,000 dollars a year through the initiative.


The pilot program will run alongside a control group of 2,500
lower income families, who will not be given any incentive
payments. Bloomberg said the city would aim to make the program
permanent if it proves successful.
