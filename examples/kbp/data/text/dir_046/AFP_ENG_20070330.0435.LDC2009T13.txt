A New York artist's life-size sculpture of a naked Jesus Christ
cast in dark chocolate has proved too much to swallow for an
American Roman Catholic group, which has called for a boycott of
the work.


"This is hate speech. And choosing Holy Week ... makes it a
direct in-your-face assault on Christians," said Bill Donohue of
the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights of the
anatomically revealing Easter sculpture.


The work, titled "My Sweet Lord" and made of 90 kilos (200
pounds) of chocolate, features a crucified Jesus suspended from
the ceiling and is due to go on display this weekend, the last
before Easter, at a New York hotel.


The artist, Cosimo Cavallaro, whose other projects have included
covering a house in five tons of cheese, writing VIP in excrement
and setting fire to a grand piano, was not immediately available
for comment.
