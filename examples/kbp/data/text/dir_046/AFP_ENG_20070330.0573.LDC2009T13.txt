Ireland were 117-4 after 30 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against England at Providence here on Friday chasing 267 to
win.


Niall O'Brien was on 53 with his brother Kevin O'Brien on 0.


Ireland got off to a terrible start losing opener Jeremy Bray
caught by Ravi Bopara in the gully for nought off the first ball
he faced from James Anderson with the score on six.


Eoin Morgan was then run out for two thanks to some swift work
from Sajid Mahmood backing up his own bowling. Ireland were 11-2
in the fourth over at that stage.


William Porterfield played a dogged innings of 31 off 68 balls
but as the asking run-rate crept up, he cracked and was caught
well by Ian Bell in the covers off Andrew Flintoff.


Andre Botha was the fourth wicket to fall caught by Flintoff for
18 off Monty Panesar.


England had made 266-7 off their 50 overs with Paul Collingwood
top-scoring with 90. Kevin Pietersen hit 48 while Flintoff
contributed 43.
