French clubs may call off their proposed boycott of next season's
European Cup after agreeing to a request from French Federation
president Bernard Lapasset to postpone their decision not to
compete.


Lapasset is to meet with English clubs on Monday to try to thrash
out a deal that would fend off the French clubs' boycott, being
led by French Rugby National League (LNR) president Serge Blanco.


The LNR had been given until Saturday to finalise their decision
not to take part, but that deadline has now been extended.


"Bernard Lapasset asked me to wait until Monday because he has a
meeting with the English clubs," Blanco told AFP by telephone.


Lapasset told AFP that nothing had been decided.


The LNR announced two months ago that all 14 French first
division clubs would not participate in the continent's top club
competitions next season.


Lapasset met with his English counterparts last Friday but failed
to find a solution to the existing problems.


The LNR blamed the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) over their
refusal to hand over share and voting rights in European Rugby
Cup (ERC) Limited to leading English clubs, although domestic
fixture congestion in France caused by the World Cup is being
seen as the major reason for the planned mass withdrawal.


But the RFU rejected the LNR's latest proposal regarding English
shareholding in ERC, claiming it did not provide a long-term
solution to current difficulties.


However, Lapasset is ready to try again to attempt to avert a
French boycott.
