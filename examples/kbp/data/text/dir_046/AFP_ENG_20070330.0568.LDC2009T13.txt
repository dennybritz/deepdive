England's Ross McGowan, competing in only his second European
tour event after turning professional just four months ago, holds
the lead in the Portugal Open after Friday's second round.


Last year's English amateur champion, lying joint second
overnight, hit a second successive 68 for a six under par total
of 136 at the Oitavos course.


He only made the field after picking up a sponsor's invitation
despite failing to pick up a Tour card at last November's
qualifying school.


McGowan said: "This is new territory for me, so we will see how
it goes.


"On the amateur scene I had the lead after 36 holes, but it's
different with the pros."


Fellow Briton Nick Dougherty is two shots behind after carding a
second successive 69, with a group of five players in a tie for
fifth a further shot adrift.


Former Ryder Cup star Paul Broadhurst, aiming to become only the
fifth player in the history of the Tour to win the same
tournament three years on the trot, is four shots behind.


Simon Dyson, who led by a shot going into Friday's second round,
slipped off the pace, producing a disappointing 74 to move down
to a share of 13th place and five shots off the lead.
