Buckingham Palace opened the doors Friday to a rare exhibition of
Italian art in the Royal Collection, including two paintings
discovered to be lost works by Italian master Caravaggio.


"A Boy Peeling Fruit" and "The Calling of Saints Peter and
Andrew" went on display in Britain for the first time since being
identified as Caravaggio works.


The Art of Italy exhibition also features works by Raphael,
Michaelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Titian.


Desmond Shawe-Taylor, officially the surveyor of the queen's
pictures, said the paintings were an "unsurpassable" collection
of Baroque and Renaissance art.


"We knew we had an unimaginably great drawings collection and
knew we had unbelievably wonderful individual paintings," he
said.


"I don't think anybody quite knew how good it was together.


"It's an absolutely exceptional collection en masse, as well as
individual examples, and it does tell a very interesting and
distinctive story of Italian art."


The exhibition runs until January 20, 2008.
