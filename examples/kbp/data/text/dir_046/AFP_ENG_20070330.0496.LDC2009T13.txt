Sarah Hammer of the United States turned on the power to
successfully defend her women's world pursuit crown here at the
world track cycling championships on Friday.


Britain's Rebecca Romero was outclassed by the American in the
final, finishing over three seconds slower than her winning time
of 3min 30.213sec to take the silver medal after the 12-lap race.


Australian Katie Mactier, the world champion in 2005, dominated
Britain's Wendy Houvenaghel in the battle for third place to take
her second consecutive bronze medal from the world championships.


Hammer was defending the title she won last year in Bordeaux,
France when she beat Russian Olga Slyusareva.
