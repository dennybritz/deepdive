Britain's Chris Hoy won the men's world keirin crown here at the
track cycling world championships on Friday.


Hoy, the one kilometre world champion, finished first in the
frantic final to hold off a late Dutch challenge from defending
champion Theo Bos and fellow Scot Ross Edgar.


Edgar finished second to take the silver while Bos, who is also
the reigning sprint champion, finished third.


It is Britain's first ever world title in the event, which is
motor-paced for the first few of the race's eight laps before
riders jostle for position ahead of their dash to the finish
line.
