A Hamas militant was killed and nine others wounded on Friday in
an explosion at a training camp of the Islamist movement in
southern Gaza, medics and security sources said.


The immediate cause of the explosion was not known, they said.


The training camp is located on the site of a former Jewish
settlement near the southern city of Khan Yunis, which was
dismantled in 2005 when Israel pulled out all settlers and troops
from Gaza.


Three Palestinian teenagers were also wounded when an old Israeli
tank shell with which they were playing exploded east of the
southern town of Rafah, security sources said.
