Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe was chosen by his ruling ZANU-PF
party on Friday to stand again as its candidate in presidential
elections in 2008, a party spokesman said.


"The candidate for the party in 2008 will be the president
himself. He was endorsed by the central committee," party
spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira told reporters.


Mugabe, 83, has been in power in the former British colony since
independence in 1980.
