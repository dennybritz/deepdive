Former Olympic champion Ian Thorpe of Australia tested positive
for testosterone and a banned hormone in 2006, according to
French newspaper L'Equipe's website on Friday.


The 24-year-old, who retired in November, was a major star of the
sport, winning five Olympic crowns and eleven world titles, while
aslo setting 23 world records.


But according to L'Equipe, he tested positive for abnormally high
levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone.


L'Equipe said the Australian Sport Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA)
decided to close Thorpe's case after studying the evidence.


However, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) appealed to
the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in an effort to reopen
the file.
