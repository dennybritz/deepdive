Britain reclaimed the coveted men's team pursuit crown here at
the world track cycling championships on Friday after outclassing
fellow finalists Ukraine.


Ukraine, who lost a rider before the 3000 metre mark of the 4km
race, took the silver medal ahead of a resurgent Denmark, who
proved too fast for New Zealand in their 16-lap race for the
bronze medal.


British quartet Edward Clancy, Geraint Thomas, Paul Manning and
Bradley Wiggins had set a relatively rare sub-four minute time to
dominate qualifying earlier Friday.


And they proved again on form against the outclassed Ukrainians
in a stunning time of 3min 57.468sec - a new British record - to
reclaim the title they won for the first time in 2005.


Ukraine finished in a time of 4:03.280.


Defending champions Australia, who have dominated the team
pursuit in the past decade and are the reigning Olympic champions
and world record holders, failed to make the medal rounds for the
first time since 2001 when they finished sixth in qualifying.


Australia hold the world record in a time of 3:56.610, set during
the Athens Olympics.


Britain won two gold medals on the first day of the championships
Thursday through Victoria Pendleton and Sharaze Reade in the
women's team sprint and Bradley Wiggins in the men's individual
pursuit.
