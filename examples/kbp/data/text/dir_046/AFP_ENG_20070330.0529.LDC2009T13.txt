Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change on Friday
denounced the prospect of veteran President Robert Mugabe
standing for re-election next year as a "tragedy" for the
country.


"This is a tragedy for the country. This country will not move so
long as Mugabe is there," the party's secretary general Tendai
Biti told AFP.


"It's also a shame on Mugabe's part. After mismanaging the
country for 27 years he now wants to stand for another five
years."


Biti was reacting after Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party endorsed
the 83-year-old as its candidate in next year's presidential
elections.


ZANU-PF earlier approved plans for a constitutional amendment
which would reduce the presidential term from the current six to
five years.


The MDC has already indicated that it will not field a candidate
against Mugabe whom it accuses of having rigged the last
elections in 2002.
