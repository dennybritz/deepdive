England were 45-2 after 10 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against Ireland at Providence here on Friday.


Ian Bell was on 17 with Kevin Pietersen on 11.


Seamer Boyd Rankin took both the early wickets to fall. He bowled
former Irish teammate Ed Joyce for one and then had captain
Michael Vaughan caught behind by Niall O'Brien for 6 leaving
England struggling at 23-2.


Vaughan won the toss and elected to bat at the Guyana National
Stadium.


England kept the same team which won the last first round match
against Kenya, while Ireland captain Trent Johnston was back
after missing his team's last match against the West Indies due
to a shoulder injury.
