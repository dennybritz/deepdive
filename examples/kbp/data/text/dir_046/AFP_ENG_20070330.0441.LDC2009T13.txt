Japan is to extend up to 95 billion yen (805 million dollars) in
low-interest loans to Vietnam, the foreign ministry said Friday.


The official loans are earmarked for the fiscal year ending
Saturday and are intended to help Vietnam's economic and social
development and its efforts to promote a market economy, the
ministry said in a statement.


The total is up 4.7 percent from the soft loans extended in the
preceding year.


Of the total, up to 20,887 million yen will finance a project to
build an urban rail system in Ho Chi Minh City using Japanese
technology, the statement said.


It added that loans totalling 20,943 million yen would bankroll
construction of a coal-fired power plant and related facilities
at an industrial complex in the northern province of Thanh Hoa.
