Australian David Hicks faces a maximum of seven years in prison
under a plea bargain in his trial for links to Al-Qaeda, a
military judge said Friday.


Hicks had faced life in prison but the judge, Colonel Ralph
Kohlmann, told the military tribunal here that under under a
plea-baragaining arrangement, the Australian would face a
"maximum confinment of seven years."


Prosecutors hade said previously that the five years Hicks spent

taken into account for his sentencing.
