Danish lawmakers have agreed to withdraw the country's 430 troops
from Iraq in August, a parliamentary source said on Friday.


The deal struck between the ruling conservative and liberal
parties, their far- right allies and the opposition Social
Democrats and Radicals also backed sending reinforcements to
Danish troops in Afghanistan.


The agreement, which was reached without a vote, follows
February's decision by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen to
withdraw Denmark's troops from Basra in southern Iraq, where they
are under British command, in August.


Before that, Denmark will send four helicopters and 50 personnel
to support the British deployment there, the parliamentary deal
said.


On a humanitarian level, the agreement commits the government to
giving 100 million Danish kronor (13.4 million euros) to help
Iraqi refugees and displaced people in 2007 and as much again in
2008.


This is double what Rasmussen announced in February and follows
pressure from the Social Democrats, the party's leader Helle
Thorning-Schmidt said.


Denmark will also send about 200 extra soldiers to Afghanistan
after the Iraq withdrawal, bringing its military presence there
to 600, according to the agreement.
