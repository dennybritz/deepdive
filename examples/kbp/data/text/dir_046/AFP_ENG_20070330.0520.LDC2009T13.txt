House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to visit Syria soon, amid deep
tensions between Damascus and Washington over Lebanon and Iraq, a
US congressional aide said Friday.


Pelosi -- currently in Israel with a delegation that includes
Democrat Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the US
Congress -- will travel to Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, said
Ellison spokesman Rick Jauert.


The White House swiftly denounced Pelosi's plan, which would make
her the most senior US official to visit Syria in years, as "a
really bad idea" that might only help Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad.
