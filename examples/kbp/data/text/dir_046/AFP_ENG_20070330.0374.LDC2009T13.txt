Iran on Friday told European Union leaders to stay neutral in a
standoff with Britain over Tehran's detention of 15 British naval
personnel.


"EU officials should refrain from taking a partial stance in
support of British aggression in Iran's territorial waters," the
official IRNA agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad
Ali Hosseini as saying.


EU foreign ministers meeting in Germany were on Friday to send a
message of solidarity with Britain over the March 23 seizure of
its 15 sailors and marines in the northern Gulf.


Hosseini was reacting to comments on Thursday by EU foreign
policy chief Javier Solana, who called the detention
"unacceptable" and promised Britain solidarity.


"Mr Solana's statements and some European stances over this issue
are unjustified, irrational, undocumented and irresponsible,"
Hosseini said, insisting the British presence in Iranian waters
was "clear and certain".


"Iran regards these (statements) as meddling in its affairs," he
said.


Iran says the forces illegally entered its waters but Britain
insists they were operating in Iraqi waters.
