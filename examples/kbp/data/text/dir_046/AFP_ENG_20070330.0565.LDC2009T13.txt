An earthquake measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale jolted the
western Turkish province of Isparta on Friday, but there were no
immediate reports of casualties, officials said.


The epicenter of the tremor, which hit at 7:56 pm (1656 GMT), was
at the district of Egirdir, the Istanbul-based Kandilli
observatory said.


There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties, Egirdir
sub-governor Omer Ulu told Anatolia news agency.


Earthquakes are frequent in Turkey, which is crossed by several
major fault lines. Two violent temblors in the heavily populated,
industrialised northwest claimed about 20,000 lives in August and
November 1999.
