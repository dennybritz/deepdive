A Saudi prisoner at the US "war on terror" camp in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, said he had confessed under torture, according to a
report released Friday by the Defense Department.


Abdel Rahim al-Nachiri, the suspected mastermind behind the 2002
attack of the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole in Yemen,
testified before a US military tribunal to determine his status
as an "enemy combatant" on March 14.


"The detainee states that he was tortured into confession and
once he made a confession his captors were happy and they stopped
torturing him. Also, the detainee states that he made up stories
during the torture in order to get it to stop," the Pentagon said
in its report of the prisoner's testimony.


Arrested in late October 2002 in the United Arab Emirates,
Nachiri is suspected by the United States of being the Al-Qaeda
operations chief in the Gulf.


Among his alleged operations were the attacks against US
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, which claimed 224
lives, and the USS Cole attack, which killed 17.


The military tribunals, or commissions, at the US naval base in
Guantanamo Bay have been reconstituted under a new law after the
US Supreme Court declared an earlier version unconstitutional.
But human rights groups say the tribunals flout the rules of
regular US courts and deny the accused a fair trial.
