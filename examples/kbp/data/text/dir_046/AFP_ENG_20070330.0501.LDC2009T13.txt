India has set up a panel to review a possible cut in troop levels
in insurgency- racked Kashmir, the prime minister's office
announced Friday.


The announcement came after demands by a regional ally of premier
Manmohan Singh's ruling Congress party, which also governs
Kashmir, to reduce troop numbers in the Himalayan region.


"The panel would be a professional body ... to determine whether
there is need to relocate and reconfigure security forces (in
Kashmir)," Singh's office said.


"While making its determination, the panel should ensure that
cardinal aspects of security are not compromised in any manner,"
it said in a statement.


The panel would also review the use of a draconian military law
that gives sweeping powers to soldiers battling the Islamic
insurgency in Kashmir, which according to official figures has
claimed more than 42,000 lives since its launch in 1989, it
added.


Mufti Mohammed Sayeed's People's Democratic Party (PDP) has
threatened to withdraw its support if Delhi rejects its demands
for troop cuts by mid-year.


India has deployed an estimated half a million troops and
paramilitary soldiers in Kashmir, the subject of two of the three
wars between India and Pakistan since their 1947 independence
from the British.


Pakistan has linked the region's demiliterisation to lasting
peace between the South Asian arch-rivals.
