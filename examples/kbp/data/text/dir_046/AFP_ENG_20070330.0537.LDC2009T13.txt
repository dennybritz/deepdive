Ireland were 41-2 after 10 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against England at Providence here on Friday chasing 267 to
win.


William Porterfield was on 23 with Niall O'Brien on 9.


Ireland had got off to a terrible start losing opener Jeremy Bray
caught by Ravi Bopara in the gully for nought off the first ball
he faced from James Anderson with the score on six.


Eoin Morgan was then run out for two thanks to some swift work
from Sajid Mahmood backing up his own bowling. Ireland were 11-2
in the fourth over at that stage.


England had made 266-7 off their 50 overs with Paul Collingwood
top-scoring with 90. Kevin Pietersen hit 48 while Andrew Flintoff
contributed 43.
