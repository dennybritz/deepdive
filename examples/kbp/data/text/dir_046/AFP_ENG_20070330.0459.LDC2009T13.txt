US President George W. Bush notified the US Congress on Friday
that he will sign the US-Panama free trade agreement, in what
could be a major boost to commerce before the Panama Canal is
expanded.


"I am pleased to notify the Congress of my intention to enter
into a free trade agreement with the Republic of Panama," Bush
said in a letter to congressional leaders.


The move came one day before the deadline for Bush to notify
lawmakers under rules tied to the president's "fast track"
authority, which binds Congress to up or down votes on trade
pacts without being able to alter them.


He was required to notify lawmakers 90 days before he signs the
agreement.


Fast track -- formally known as Trade Promotion Authority --
lapses in late June.
