Germany recorded a 14-percent increase in crimes committed by the
far-right in 2006, the interior ministry said on Friday.


Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the increase was
"reason for concern."


He added that it was particularly worrying that most politically
motivated crimes were carried out by people between the ages of
18 and 20, suggesting growing extremism among the youth.


The number of crimes linked to right-wing extremists last year
came to 18,142. Violent crimes carried out by the far-right
increased by 7.8 percent, according to the ministry.


There was also a rise, albeit smaller, in crimes carried out by
left-wing radicals, making for a general increase of 10 percent
in politically motivated crimes of which 29,050 were reported in
total.


Germany has in recent years nervously watched neo-Nazis gain a
political foothold, particularly in the former communist east
where they have exploited young voters' unhappiness with rampant
unemployment.


In regional elections in September 2006, the neo-Nazi National
Democratic Party won seats in the legislature in the eastern
state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, exactly two years after
doing so in Saxony.
