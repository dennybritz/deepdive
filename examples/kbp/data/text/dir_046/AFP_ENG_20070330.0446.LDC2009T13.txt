Bosnian Serb police confiscated property owned by the family of a
war crimes suspect for the first time on Friday, a report said.


The police had sealed off access to a petrol station owned by an
unnamed son of Stojan Zupljanin, who is wanted by the UN war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Bosnian Serb radio said.


The seizure is based on recent legislation giving authorities the
right to confiscate property from those found to have been aiding
war crimes suspects.


Stojan Zupljanin, 56, has been wanted by the tribunal since 1999.


He was originally charged with genocide, but his indictment was
later amended to charges of crimes against humanity and
violations of customs of war.


Bosnian Serb police have targetted his family in raids over the
past few months in the belief that they have provided him with
financial and other assistance that has enabled him to remain in
hiding.


Last month, the international community's deputy envoy to Bosnia,
Raffi Gregorian, said property belonging to the family of top war
crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic should be confiscated.


Karadzic, the wartime Bosnian Serb political leader, and his
military chief Ratko Mladic have been at large since 1995, when
the UN court charged them over the Srebrenica massacre of 8,000
Muslims.
