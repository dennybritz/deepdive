An investigation by Guinea authorities into a deadly general
anti-government strike staged early this year has found that 137
people, mostly civilians, were killed and nearly 1,700 injured.


"The minister of interior and security has presented a report
where it was noted that during the January and February events,
there were 137 deaths and 1.667 wounded," information minister
Justin Morel Junior, said on state television.


Among the injured were 11 children who had to be evacuated to
Lausanne in Switzerland.


Initial estimates put the numbers of killed at 113.


Guinea's powerful unions staged a crippling strike against the
government of veteran President Lansana Conte which elicited a
bloody crackdown.


The sweeping protest launched on January 22 paralysed Guinea for
more than a month, forcing Conte to place the country under
martial law for 12 days.


The strike and the protests also forced the government to name a
new prime minister of consensus Lansana Kouyate to replace
Conte's handpicked Eugene Camara, who held office for less than
three weeks.
