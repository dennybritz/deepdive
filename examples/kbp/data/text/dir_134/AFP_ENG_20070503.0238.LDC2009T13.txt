The US military cannot confirm that Al-Qaeda in Iraq leaders Abu
Omar al- Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri have been killed, as has
been claimed by Iraqi officials, a spokesman said Thursday.


"We have nobody in our possession nor know anyone who has a
person alive or dead that we can do DNA testing on," Brigadier
General William Caldwell said.


Caldwell was addressing a Baghdad news conference following
claims by Iraqi interior ministry officials that the two leading
figures in the insurgency had been killed this week in separate
clashes.
