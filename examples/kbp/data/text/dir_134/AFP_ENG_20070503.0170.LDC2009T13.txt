Former Olympic acrobatic ski gold medallist Ales Valenta of the
Czech Republic on Thursday announced his retirement due to health
problems.


Valenta was one of the unexpected stars of the 2002 Salt Lake
City Games when he clinched gold in the freestyle aerials with a
stunning quintiple twist with triple backflip jump.


But he said Thursday: "If I were healthy, the decision could have
been more difficult, but it now looks like a necessity.


"The doctors have said that if I continue with my career it could
have negative consequences in the future."


Valenta said he had been weighing up his future since the end of
the last season. He revealed earlier this year that acrobatic
jumping was causing him pain due to back problems, and that he
did not enjoy it any more.


In spite of his retirement, Valenta might still appear at the
2010 Olympic games in Vancouver, Canada, since he wants to
continue as a referee in the sport in which he excelled.
