Swedish police have increased security around the Russian embassy
in Stockholm after two men threw cobblestones into the embassy
grounds, police said on Thursday.


"Yes, we have increased security," a Stockholm police duty
officer told AFP, adding that two men had thrown stones onto the
embassy grounds late Wednesday.


Press reports said several cars were damaged.


Sweden on Wednesday issued a protest to Moscow after its
ambassador to Russia Johan Molander was attacked during a visit
to the Estonian embassy in Moscow.


The attack occurred as Molander visited the embassy to discuss
diplomatic tension between Russia and Estonia following the
relocation of a Soviet war memorial in the Baltic state's
capital, Tallinn.


Immediately after the incident in Stockholm, the Russian embassy
contacted the Swedish foreign ministry and asked authorities to
guarantee the mission's safety.


"We were in touch with police prior to the incident as we were
concerned something might happen and again after the embassy had
expressed its concern over the incident," foreign ministry
spokeswoman Sofia Karlberg told AFP.


"We are now monitoring the situation," she added.
