The Turkish parliament on Thursday approved a call for early
general elections on July 22 to end a damaging crisis over
choosing a new president.


Deputy parliament speaker Sadik Yakut announced that all 458
lawmakers who took part in the electronic ballot in the televised
session voted in favour of the ruling party's proposal for ealy
polls.


Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested bringing
legislative elections forward from November after Turkey's top
court annulled a first-round parliamentary vote to elect the next
president that sparked a crisis with the army over the Islamist
roots of the sole candidate.
