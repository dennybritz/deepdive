New car registrations in Spain fell by 6.0 percent in April on a
12-month basis to 121,721 units, the country's car manufacturers'
association Anfac said Thursday.


Since the beginning of the year 532,527 new cars have been
registered in Spain, a 1.9 percent decrease over the same time in
2006, it said in a statement posted on its Internet site.


Rising interest rates in the eurozone have been blamed for the
fall in car sales in Spain, where household debt is at record
levels.


Citroen led registrations during the month of April with 12,037
units, ahead of Renault and Peugeot.
