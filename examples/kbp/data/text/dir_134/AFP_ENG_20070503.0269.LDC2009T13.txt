Argentine football legend Diego Maradona will enter a Buenos
Aires mental health clinic for 13 days for treatment for alcohol
abuse, his personal doctor Alfredo Cahe said Thursday.


"We are starting another phase. Maradona is able to go out for
therapeutic reasons. He can exercise and see his family," Cahe
told radio Del Plata.


Former Argentine captain Maradona, who has struggled with cocaine
and alcohol abuse for years, was hospitalized for 22 days in
April suffering from hepatitis linked to heavy drinking.


Cahe said Maradona has begun talking more with other patients who
are struggling with addictions.
