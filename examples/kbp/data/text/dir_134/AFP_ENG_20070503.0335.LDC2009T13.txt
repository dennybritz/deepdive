The new leaders in Mauritania will be forced to declare their
assets in a bid to reduce the risk of corruption, the official
news agency AMI said Thursday.


The new government's cabinet decided at its first cabinet meeting
on Wednesday since sweeping to power last week that all top
leadership have to make known their wealth.


"The president of the republic, the prime minister as well as the
members of the government will declare their property," said a
statement cited by AMI.


The new government, formed on April 28, is composed mainly of
technocrats and political nonentities.


Prime Minister and former central bank chief Zeine Ould Zeidane
pledged the government's commitment to fight graft.


During the cabinet meeting President Sidi Ould Cheik Abdallahi
also "gave instructions for administrative reforms" while
insisting on "rigour and transparency in management and
objectivity in the selection of management based on competence
and integrity."


Corruption and pilfering of state funds were widespread under the
former rule of ousted president Maaouiya Ould Taya, toppled in a
bloodless coup in August 2005 by a military junta which has just
handed over power to a civilian government.


Abdallahi was elected on March 25 to finalise a 19-month
democratic transition effected in the junta in this Islamic
republic situated in northwest Africa.


He is the first democratically elected leader in this former
French colony since Mauritania's independence in 1960.


His predecessors stormed to power either through military
takeovers or were re- elected in fraudulent polls.
