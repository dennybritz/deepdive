An indefinite curfew has been imposed in a  western Nepal border
town following clashes between police and unarmed Maoist cadres
that injured at least 17 people, officials said Thursday.


The clash erupted Wednesday after "Maoist cadres attacked
policemen who were evicting Maoists from government-owned land
they had occupied for the past five years," said Keshav Raj
Sharma, an official at Bardiya around 500 kilometres (300 miles)
west of Kathmandu.


He said that at least 17 people including seven policemen and
several Maoist cadres were injured in the incident.


"The indefinite curfew was imposed to prevent any violence," said
Sharma.


The Maoists have opposed the local authority's decision to
station Armed Police Force personnel at a government-owned
building in the area for security duty along the Nepal-India
border, the official said.


The Maoists have had their army and weapons confined to UN-
monitored camps, but continue to face accusations that they have
not stopped using violence and intimidation.


Early this week, the former rebels in west Nepal overran a police
post and kidnapped 11 officers but later freed them.


Nepal's Maoists signed a peace deal with the government late last
year that ended a decade of bloody civil war.


At least 13,000 people were killed in the conflict that crippled
an already fragile economy and displaced tens of thousands of
people.
