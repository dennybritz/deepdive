Jailed Irish gang leaders are using mobile phones in their cells
to continue to run their crime empires on the outside, Justice
Minister Michael McDowell said on Thursday.


He told the annual conference of the country's Prison Officers'
Association that the phones were a valuable asset for crime
bosses and over 600 of them have been seized so far this year.


On Tuesday McDowell was furious when a convicted armed robber
serving a nine year sentence in the maximum security Portlaoise
Prison used a mobile phone to ring a chat show on RTE state
radio.


He told the conference the incident highlighted the problem of
criminals making illegal contact with the outside world.


"The challenge to the prison service is to prevent these
criminals from issuing instructions relating to illegal activity
from the comfort of their prison cells or from exerting influence
over other prisoners.


"Drugs and mobile phones are the currency used by gang leaders
within the prison system to exert power and control over other
prisoners and to maintain their control outside the prison as
well."


He said a system to block mobile phone signals within the
perimeter of a prison will shortly be introduced in one prison
and "will be rapidly extended to all prisons".


MacDowell, who has taken a tough line on crime, is currently
campaigning in the general election called for May 24.


He is the leader of the centre-right Progressive Democrats junior
partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition.
