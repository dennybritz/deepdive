US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to meet her Syrian
counterpart, Walid Muallem, Thursday on the sidelines of a
conference on Iraq, a senior state department official told
reporters.


"I expect they will have a discussion on border security issues.
We'll see if it happens," the official said on condition of
anonymity.


The last high-ranking US official to hold talks with Syrian
officials was then deputy secretary of state Robert Armitage, who
travelled to Damascus in January 2005.
