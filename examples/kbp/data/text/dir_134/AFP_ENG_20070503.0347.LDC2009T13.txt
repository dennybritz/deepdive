The UN World Food Programme said Thursday it was stepping up
efforts to deliver food to almost 100,000 refugees from heavy
fighting in the Somali capital Mogadishu.


"Last week we reached 32,000 people west of Mogadishu, and we're
now expanding our operations further west to Qoryoley, and south
to Merka and Brava," WFP executive director Josette Sheeran said
in a communique.


An Ethiopian offensive last week put an end to nine days of heavy
clashes, in which around 400 died and some 400,000 civilians were
displaced to squalid camps on the outskirts of the city where the
WFP said cholera was spreading.


The Rome-based WFP hopes to reach a further 50,000 of those
"driven from their homes in Mogadishu by the worst fighting in 16
years," the statement said.


"Many people left the capital with virtually nothing but the
clothes on their backs. They are now trickling back only to find
their homes in ruins," Sheeran said, adding: "The majority of
those who fled the fighting are still suffering in terrible
conditions outside the city."


The WFP on Wednesday airlifted 14 tonnes of non-food items
donated by the Italian government including water purification
equipment to Baidoa, around 250 kilometres (155 miles) northwest
of the capital, the communique said.
