Romanian police have found over 60 kilogrammes of heroin in a car
that was impounded in 2002 and had been in government hands for
five years, local media reported Thursday.


Officers from the organised crime unit discovered the drugs under
the backseat of the Porsche, which they had been given to use in
tailing operations, during a technical check, television news
channel Realitatea TV.


Border police seized the Porsche from two Turkish traffickers in
2002 after finding 60 kilogrammes of heroin in it but did not
notice the other 60 kilogrammes (132 pounds) tucked in the back.


The car was handed to the finance ministry a year after it was
impounded, before being passed on to the Government General
Secretariat which gave it to the police.


Authorities have begun an investigation into the matter.
