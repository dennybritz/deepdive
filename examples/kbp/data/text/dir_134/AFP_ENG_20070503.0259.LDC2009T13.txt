The US military killed a senior Al-Qaeda figure this week in
Iraq, but he was not the group's chief as claimed by Iraqi
officials, spokesman Brigadier General William Caldwell said on
Thursday.


Caldwell told reporters that US forces killed Al-Qaeda in Iraq's
"information minister", whom he identified as Muharib Abdulatif
al-Juburi, early Tuesday in an area just north of Baghdad.


"He was killed at 2:00 am on May 1 (2200 GMT on April 30) in an
operation a few miles west of Taji. This is the individual that
has caused some confusion and was the senior Al-Qaeda person
killed," he said.


"His was the only body we took at the site," he added. "DNA
testing and photo identification confirmed this yesterday."


Earlier, Iraqi interior minister operations director Brigadier
General Abdel Karim Khalaf told state television that Muharib al-
Juburi was also known as Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the head of an Al-
Qaeda umbrella group.


But Caldwell said the US military had no knowledge of Baghdadi.


Earlier in the week, Iraqi officials had described the man killed
near Taji as Abu Ayyub al-Masri, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, but
Caldwell said this was not possible as tests would have already
proved this.


"If in fact we did get al-Masri, we would be able to give
positive identification unequivocally," the general insisted.


Caldwell suggested the confusion may have arisen because the
militant's body had been released to his tribesmen, who had
subsequently been arrested by interior ministry forces, who
believed they had found an Al-Qaeda leader.
