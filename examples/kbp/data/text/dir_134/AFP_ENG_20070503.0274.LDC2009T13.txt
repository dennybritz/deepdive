Two people were critically wounded by a bomb blast Thursday at a
food depot in India's northeast state of Assam that police said
could be linked to a ransom demand by separatist rebels.


A police spokesman said the explosion occurred at a depot run by
state-owned Food Corporation of India in Assam's main city of
Guwahati.


"Two of the workers were seriously injured in the blast. We
suspect it to be an improvised explosive device," a senior police
official who asked not to be named told AFP.


The blast was linked by police to the United Liberation Front of
Asom (ULFA) which has been fighting for an independent homeland
since 1979. The rebels kidnapped Food Corporation director
Phulchand Ram in April and demanded a two million rupee ransom
(50,000 dollars) for his release.


"Maybe the blast at the depot was a warning by the ULFA to
pressurise the department to cough up the ransom money," the
police official said.


The rebel group was unavailable for comment.


The ULFA in the past two months has staged at least half-a-dozen
bomb attacks in Guwahati that killed one and wounded at least 30
others.


An Indian home ministry report released earlier this week said 99
civilians were killed by the ULFA in 156 incidents in Assam from
January to March 31.


New Delhi launched a massive military offensive against the ULFA
after the strikes, killing 55 rebels and arresting 553 cadres
since January.


More than 10,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in
Assam during the past two decades.
