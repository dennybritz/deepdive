Croatia's journalists' association warned Thursday against
political pressures and ethics violations in the local media, in
a statement on World Press Freedom Day.


"We warn against the still existing influence of the authorities
on national public media such as Croatian television and Hina"
news agency, the association said.


These "could burden Croatia's negotiations with the EU," the
union added. added.


Local media had criticised political pressures on Croatian
national television after its programme director was recently
forced to resign.


The association also warned journalists and media owners against
"serious degrading of professional ethics" including "frequent
violations of national, religoius, sexual and other rights."


The union organised a symbolic five-minute protest silence
Thursday to protest at job insecurity and deteriorating work
conditions.


Journalists have been negotiating with employers for four years,
so far without result, to create a standard contract on the
national level to regulate their status.


The lack of agreement is due to "employers' reluctance to
recognize some basic rights to journalists," the union said.


Brussels has urged Croatia, which started membership talks in
2005 with the 27-member European Union, to ensure press freedom.
