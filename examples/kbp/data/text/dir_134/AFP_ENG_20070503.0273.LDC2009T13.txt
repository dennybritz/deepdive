Syria appears to have taken measures to stem the flow of foreign
extremist fighters crossing its border into Iraq, the US
military's chief spokesman in Baghdad said on Thursday.


"There is some movement from the Syrians. There has in fact been
a reduction in the amount of foreign fighter flow making its way
into Iraq at this point from Syria," Major General William
Caldwell told reporters.


Washington has long accused Iraq's neighbours Iran and Syria of
allowing weapons and militants to cross their borders to foment
trouble in Iraq, where US forces are battling insurgents and
sectarian militias.


Caldwell said he did not know why Syria appeared to be changing
its stance, but his announcement coincided with the news that US
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to meet her Syrian
counterpart on the sidelines of an international conference on
Iraq in Egypt.
