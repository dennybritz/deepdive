Construction of a three-billion-dollar causeway linking Saudi
Arabia and Egypt will begin next week, the English-language Arab
News reported on Thursday.


The 50-kilometre (30-mile) causeway will link Ras Humaid in the
northern Saudi region of Tabuk to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-
Sheikh, passing through Tiran island at the entrance of the Gulf
of Aqaba, the report said.


The paper said Saudi King Abdullah will lay the foundation stone
of the causeway, "which will link the continents of Asia and
Africa," during a visit to the kingdom's northern region next
week.


The causeway will take three years to build by a consortium of
Saudi, Egyptian and international companies.


The newspaper said interest in the project was revived after an
Egyptian ferry sailing from Saudi Arabia to Egypt sank in the Red
Sea in February 2006. About 1,000 people perished in the
disaster.
