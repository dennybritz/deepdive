Niger coach Banna Tchanile has been sacked after a poor run of
results in the qualifying round for the 2008 African Nations Cup,
the Niger football federation said Thursday.


Tchanile, a Togo national whose contract ran from April 2006 to
September 2007, was charged with seeing Niger through the tough
qualifying rounds of the Cup.


But Niger currently lie bottom of Group 3, with just one point
garnered from a goalless draw against Uganda. Its first two
matches saw the team lose to Nigeria (2-0) and Lesotho (3-1).
