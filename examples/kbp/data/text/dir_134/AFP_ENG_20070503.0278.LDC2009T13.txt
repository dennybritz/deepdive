US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Iranian Foreign
Minister Manouchehr Mottaki had a brief exchange over lunch
Thursday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit said.


"There was an exchange of some words, yes. They are civilised
people after all," said Abul Gheit, adding that the lunch was
attended only by foreign ministers.


When asked if Rice and Mottaki sat next to each other, he
answered: "Beside each other you mean? No, but the table was a
small table."
