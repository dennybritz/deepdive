Indonesia had the highest deforestation rate in the world between
2000 and 2005 with almost two million hectares destroyed
annually, environmental group Greenpeace said Thursday.


Indonesia had lost more than 72 percent of its intact ancient
forests and much of the rest is threatened by commercial logging
and clearance for palm oil plantations, Greenpeace also said in a
statement.


The group said Guinness World Records had approved its proposal
that Indonesia's destruction be included in its 2008 record book
to be published in September.


"Of the 44 countries which collectively account for 90 percent of
the world's forests, the country which pursues the highest annual
rate of deforestation is Indonesia," Greenpeace said the citation
would read.


Indonesia had "1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) of forest
destroyed each year between 2000-2005, a rate of two percent
annually or 51 square kilometres (20 square miles) destroyed
every day," the group said.


Greenpeace accused the government of failing to crackdown on
illegal logging because of rampant lawlessness and corruption in
its forestry sector.


Several devastating floods and landslides have been blamed on
deforestation, most recently in the north of Sumatra island,
where more than 400,000 people were forced to flee flash floods
in December.
