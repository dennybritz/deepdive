Consumer prices in Turkey rose by 1.21 percent in April from the
previous month and by 10.72 percent on a 12-month basis, the
Turkish Statistics Institute said Thursday.


Producer prices increased by 0.8 percent from March to April,
bringing wholesale inflation over 12 months to 9.68 percent, it
said.


Inflation in 2006 was 9.65 percent, nearly double the year-end
target of 5.0 percent set in an IMF-backed austerity programme.


Authorities however remain optimistic that the 2007 target of 4.0
percent remains within reach provided tight monetary policies are
implemented.


The government pledges to maintain fiscal discipline ahead of
general elections.


The parliament Thursday brought the polls forward by more than
three months to July 22 to defuse a political crisis over a
disputed presidential vote, in which the sole candidate, Foreign
Minister Abdullah Gul, faced harsh objections by secularists over
his Islamist background.


Fighting inflation is a key element in a three-year economic
stability programme that Turkey is implementing with the support
of a 10-billion-dollar (7.5 -billion-euro) loan from the
International Monetary Fund.


IMF-backed tight financial policies have helped the government
beat inflation targets over the past three years, bringing the
rate from 29.7 percent in 2002 to 7.7 percent in 2005.
