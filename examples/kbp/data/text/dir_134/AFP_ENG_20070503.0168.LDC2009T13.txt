Gunshots were fired close to the official residence of Indian
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday but the incident was a
personal dispute and completely unrelated to the premier, police
said.


"This has got nothing to do with the security of the prime
minister's house, as it was a private dispute," police spokesman
Deependra Pathak told AFP.


Pathak said one "civilian" was injured in the shooting at a
petrol station several hundred metres (yards) from Singh's
official residence in New Delhi. He said the man was hospitalised
for treatment.


At the time of the shooting, some 400 commandos and paramilitary
forces were tasked with guarding Singh's residence, which has a
three-tier security cordon.


The premier was not at home and staff at his residence said they
had not heard the shooting.


"There was no breach in the PM's security. The incident happened
quite a distance from here," a staff member, who asked not to be
named, told AFP by telephone.
