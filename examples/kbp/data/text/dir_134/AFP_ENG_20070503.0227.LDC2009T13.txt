World Boxing Association super featherweight champion Edwin
Valero of Venezuela stretched his stunning run of consecutive
knockout victories to 22 when beating challenger Nobuhito Honmo
on Thursday.


The referee stopped the fight one minute 54 seconds into the
ninth round for a technical knockout after Valero's hard hit drew
blood from close to the Japanese challenger's right eye in the
eighth round.


"I didn't care for a knockout victory. I would have been
satisfied with a decision victory. I think I showed a different
style of boxing today using my footwork. Honmo is a brave
fighter," said Valero.


The 25-year-old Valero has now won 22 out of 22 bouts, all of
them knockout victories, including a world record of 18
consecutive first-round wins.


His streak ended in March last year when he needed two rounds to
pull off a technical knockout in his 19th bout. In August 2006 he
snatched the WBA title from Vicente Mosquera of Panama.


The 30-year-old challenger, ranked second in the WBA, has 29
wins, including five KOs, against five defeats and two draws.


"I fought as I had planned to do, but I was very disappointed
that I lost like this. I'm going to put an end to my career. It
was tense to fight my first title match, it was really a great
match for me," said Honmo.
