Denmark's armed forces said it had suffered its first combat loss
in Afghanistan after a soldier who was seriously injured in the
war-torn country last weekend died in a Copenhagen hospital on
Thursday.


The victim was shot in the throat when rebels attacked his unit
in southern Helmand province last Sunday as it headed to join a
NATO operation against the Taliban set to begin the next day.


The injured soldier was evacuated by helicopter to a field
hospital before being flown to Denmark.


"This is the first soldier killed in combat in this country," a
spokesman for the Danish armed forces said.


Three Danish soldiers died in an accidental explosion in Kabul in
March 2002.


The Danish government, a close ally of Washington, announced
plans in February to increase its troop numbers in Afghanistan
from 400 to 600 once it has withdrawn its 430 ground troops from
Iraq next August.
