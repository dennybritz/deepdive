Alarmed by noise pollution, a Kenyan Rift Valley town has ordered
all churches to install soundproof equipment or move out,
officials said Thursday.


The Eldoret Municipal Council said residents had complained that
the town's dozens of churches were a public nuisance owing to
constant noise -- mainly preaching and songs -- from sound-
distorting woofers.


"Most churches have become a nuisance to the public. They disturb
people with their summons and songs," council board member
Patrick Omollo told AFP by telephone from Eldoret, an
agricultural town in the Rift Valley region.


"We have instructed them to control the noise by installing
soundproof equipment, or move out. I hope they are law-abiding
churches and will respect the order," he added.


In addition, the council has barred religious groups from
gathering in the town's public gardens.


The crackdown comes as Kenyan town councils are under pressure to
deliver basic services and reduce pollution.


Churches have mushroomed in the majority Christian East African
nation in recent years, mostly in urban areas where roadside
preachers hold sway over the masses, pledging to perform
miracles.


Since the year 2000, the number of Evangelical churches in Kenya
has nearly doubled, from 20,000 to 38,000, according to the
Evangelical Alliance of Kenya, and experts say the figure may be
higher due to a huge growth in small, unregistered churches.
