The football world paid tribute to England legend Alan Ball on
Thursday, as he was laid to rest following his death at the age
of 61 last week.


Ball's coffin was led into Winchester Cathedral in southern
England shrouded with the red-on-white St George's cross England
flag and with his trademark grey flat cap on top.


"My most abiding memory of Alan is in the World Cup final. I
think all the lads agree he was the best player on the pitch by
far," said midfielder Nobby Stiles, who was in the team which
beat West Germany 4-2 after extra time in the final 41 years ago.


"He covered every blade of grass, he was unbelievable."


Ball was found dead at his home last Wednesday. He died of a
heart attack while putting out a small fire which had broken out
in a compost heap in his garden, according to his family.


Others at his funeral in Winchester Cathedral included 1966 team-
mates Jack Charlton, George Cohen, Roger Hunt and goalkeeper
Gordon Banks, as well as current England coach Steve McClaren and
Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.
