Gunfire was heard near the official residence of Indian Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday, Indian television reports
said, adding police said the shots were the result of a private
dispute.


Reports said the shots were apparently fired at a petrol station
several hundred metres (yards) from Singh's official residence in
New Delhi.


Contacted by AFP, a staff member at Singh's residence said he had
not heard the shots and that the prime minister was currently not
at home.
