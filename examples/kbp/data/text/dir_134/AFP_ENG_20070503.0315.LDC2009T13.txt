Wall Street shares opened higher Thursday following a fresh bout
of merger and takeover news, but also as auto giant General
Motors announced worse-than- expected profits, largely due to
mortgage lending losses.


In opening trades, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.95
points (0.11 percent) to 13,226.83, after closing at a record
13,211.88 points a day earlier.


Wednesday's close marked the blue-chip index's 17th record close
this year and 21st gain in 24 days.


The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gained 3.14 points (0.12 percent)
to 2,560.98 in initial trades, and the broad-market Standard
& Poor's 500 index rose 2.61 points (0.17 percent) to
1,498.53.


The S&P had closed at its highest level since September 2000
on Wednesday.


"The market is clearly running ahead of the fundamentals. Some
justify this on the idea that the price/earnings multiple is low
and there is room for it to rise," said Dick Green, a president
at Briefing.com.


Stocks have gained amid a flurry of upbeat earnings reports and a
recent deal- making binge, especially stoked by private equity
firms.


GM reported first quarter net profits of 62 million dollars,
compared with 602 million in the same period a year earlier.


It largely tied its weaker profits to a loss at its GMAC
financial arm of 305 million dollars compared with a profit of
495 million a year earlier, mainly due to troubled home loans.
