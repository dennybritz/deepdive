Feyenoord Rotterdam coach Erwin Koeman has resigned from his post
after his club missed out on a chance of Champions League action
next season.


Feyenoord only finished in seventh position in the Dutch league,
crucially missing out on a place in the play-offs that will
decided which other club will accompany league winners PSV
Eindhoven into the Champions League.


Instead, the Rotterdam-based club will play off for a place in
the UEFA Cup, European football's secondary competition.


"I leave the club on this sad result but I'm proud of having
trained the club for two years. I put all my soul into it," said
Koeman, who took over in July 2005 and was contracted until 2009.


Koeman's assistants John Metgod and Henk Duut will take over
training until a new coach is named.
