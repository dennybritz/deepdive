A gas explosion on a bus in southwest Russia killed at least 11
people on Thursday, Russian news agencies quoted traffic police
as saying.


The gas tank on the bus exploded in a crash with a vehicle at the
side of the road in the region of Samara, a spokeswoman for the
traffic police, Tatyana Korolyova, said.


There were 14 people on the bus, Korolyova said.


Cars and buses converted to run on natural gas, a cheaper option
amid rising petrol prices, are a common in Russia.
