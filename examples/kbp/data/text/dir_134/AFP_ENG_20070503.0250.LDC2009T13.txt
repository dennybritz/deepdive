EU regulators on Wednesday and Thursday raided firms in three
countries making hoses used to load crude oil on tankers on
suspicion they were running an illegal cartel, a European
Commission spokesman said.


EU trustbusters targeted marine hose companies in Britain, France
and Italy because they had "reason to believe" the firms had
broken European rules against price fixing, European Commission
Jonathan Todd said.


"The Commission coordinated its investigative measures with the
US Department of Justice in the context of a suspected worldwide
cartel," he added.


EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is in the midst of a
"no-tolerance" crackdown on cartels and has lodged ever-rising
record fines against those that she snares.


Most recently, the Dutch commissioner imposed the biggest fine
ever in a EU cartel case by bringing an illegal club of lift
makers crashing down in February with a penalty of 992 million
euros (1.4 billion dollars).
