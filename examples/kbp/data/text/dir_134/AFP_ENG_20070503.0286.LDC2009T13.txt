Nigeria's most high profile armed group, the Movement for the
Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), Thursday claimed
responsibility for one of the three kidnappings carried out
overnight in the south of the country.


A spokesman for the group said in an email sent to AFP that his
group carried out the attack on the Mystras, a vessel operated by
ENI of Italy and Single Buoy Moorings, in which several hostages
were taken.


"I have instructed the release of the hostages. The vessel was
meant to have been destroyed. We have no need for more hostages
just yet," the spokesman said.


He declined responsibility for another attack in which 11
expatriate workers were taken hostage.
