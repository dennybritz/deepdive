The 13-nation eurozone has so far avoided "negative impacts" from
the euro's strength against other major currencies, EU Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Thursday.


"We are so far not receiving negative impacts in the whole euro
area because of the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro
which has indeed appreciated against the dollar and yen in the
last year," he told journalists in Brussels.


The euro hit an all-time high on Friday against the US currency
of 1.3682 dollars and rose to a fresh record on Thursday against
the Japanese unit of 163.60 yen.


The euro's strength has raised concerns among some business
leaders and politicians, especially in France where presidential
candidates have said it is weakening French exports on
international markets.


In response, Almunia said "two-thirds of French exports go to
other eurozone countries, so there is an advantage of (using) the
euro."


While the euro had appreciated against the dollar over the past
four years, exports to the United States had risen, Almunia said,
stressing that the currency had provided a "good shelter" against
volatility on financial markets.


"We are concerned about the possibility of excessive volatility
in the future," he said.


"But if you want to analyze what has been so far the impact of
the exchange rate of the euro during the last four years nobody
can conclude that we are suffering in our external sector," he
added.
