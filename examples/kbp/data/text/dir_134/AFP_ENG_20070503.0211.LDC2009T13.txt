The AIG Global Investment Group signed an agreement Thursday to
acquire 65 percent of the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company
(BTC) for 1.08 billion euros, BTC announced.


"(BTC owners) Novator and Viva Ventures GmbH signed today an
agreement with AIG Global Investment Group, through its member
company AIG Capital Partners, to acquire Viva's 65-percent stake
in the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company," BTC said in a
statement.


The American International Group (AIG) is also to buy an
additional 25 percent stake in BTC, the country's sole
telecommunications provider, that was sold on the Bulgarian stock
exchange in 2005.


The owner of the 65-percent stake is US investment group Advent
International through its Austrian subsidiary Viva Ventures,
which bought the stake from the Bulgarian government in 2004 for
230 million euros (289 million dollars).


But Novator, the London-based capital investment firm of
Icelandic tycoon Thor Bjorgolfsson, acquired in late 2005 the
option to buy all of Viva's shares in BTC.


The Bulgarian press recently reported that Bjorgolfsson had
secured control over 90 percent of BTC by acquiring additional
shares sold on the Bulgarian stock exchange, but the reports were
not officially confirmed.


BTC serves some 2.5 million homes and owns Bulgaria's third
mobile operator Vivatel.


In 2006, it generated revenues of 516 million euros and 76
million euros in profit before tax, company data shows.
