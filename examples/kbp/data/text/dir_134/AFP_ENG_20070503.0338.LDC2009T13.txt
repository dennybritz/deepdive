Two former Croatian generals will go on trial next month to face
charges of atrocities against Serb civilians during the country's
1991-1995 war, a Zagreb court said Thursday.


The trial of Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac, whose cases were
transferred to Croatia from the UN war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, will begin on June 18, said the court.


The charges against the two relate to the Medak Pocket military
offensive in which they allegedly allowed forces they commanded
to massacre Serb civilians in the south of the country in
September 1993.


Among those killed were 28 civilians and five prisoners of war,
according to the indictment against the pair.


Their cases are the first to have been transferred to Croatia by
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.


The ICTY announced its intention to transfer their cases to
Croatia in 2005, saying all the necessary conditions were in
place, including assurances the generals would not be handed the
death penalty.


Ademi was released pending trial in 2002 by the UN tribunal,
while Norac has been serving a 12-year jail term since 2003, when
a court found him guilty of committing war crimes against Serb
civilians near Gospic, in southwestern Croatia.
