Shares in Prudential soared in morning deals here on Thursday
after the Daily Telegraph reported that a top investor had asked
management to mull a break up of Britain's second-biggest
insurer.


In early deals, Prudential's share price leapt to 797 pence, the
highest level since the start of 2002.


The stock later stood at 780.50 pence, marking a jump of 3.79
percent from Wednesday's close, while the FTSE 100 index rose
0.35 percent to 6,507.30 points.


According to the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, an unnamed fund
manager with a major holding in Prudential had written to
chairman David Clementi in March to request the board's thoughts
on a break-up.


The newspaper added that the letter did not demand a break-up but
asked the board to address the issue.


The Daily Telegraph also quoted a second large anonymous
shareholder as saying: "If someone put the idea of a demerger
forward we would not be opposed to it."


Prudential's current stock market capitalisation is almost 19
billion pounds (27.8 billion euros, 37.8 billion dollars).


Last year, Prudential fought off a takeover bid from British
rival Aviva which was pitched at 708 pence per share, valuing the
group at 17.2 billion pounds.
