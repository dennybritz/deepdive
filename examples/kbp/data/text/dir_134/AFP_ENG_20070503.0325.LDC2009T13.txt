Spanish champions Barcelona's defence of their title was hit by
an injury to Portuguese playmaker Deco on Thursday.


The Brazilian-born midfielder twisted his ankle in a training
ground clash with French forward Ludovic Giuly.


Barcelona revealed they did not know how much time Deco would be
out of action but said they were performing tests.


"(Deco) is undergoing medical exams to determine the extent of
the sprain," said the club.


The news will come as a blow to Barca boss Frank Rijkaard as his
league leaders attempt to hold off a late season charge from Real
Madrid, just two points behind, and the stubborn challenge of
Sevilla, one point down.


There are six matches to go in the title race with Barcelona
travelling to struggling Real Sociedad on Sunday, although
recently they have been far from their best form.
