Sri Lanka's veteran opening batsman Sanath Jayasuriya was non-
committal Thursday about playing in the cricket World Cup's next
edition in 2011, saying it was too early to mull the prospect.


Upon his return to the island Thursday after Sri Lanka's World
Cup campaign in the Caribbean, the left-handed opener said it was
now not the time to think about playing in 2011.


Jayasuriya said he needed to contemplate his future while
enjoying a break over the next few weeks before Sri Lanka's next
engagement of a One Day international series in Abu Dhabi.


There had been speculation that 2007 would be Jayasuriya's last
World Cup outing, but he remained tight-lipped.


Looking back at the tournament in which Sri Lanka emerged
runners-up to Ricky Ponting's Australians, the former Sri Lankan
captain said: "I could have done better."


Jayasuriya playing in his fifth World Cup and averaged 46.50
runs, including two centuries and two half-centuries.


His centuries, against Bangladesh and the West Indies, showed
glimpses of the destructive form which saw him being nominated
for player of the series in the 1996 World Cup.


Jayasuriya, 38, had maintained a remarkable level of fitness to
be in the reckoning for selections.


Having retired in 2005, he was recalled to join the Sri Lankans
in Australia during the early part of 2006.
