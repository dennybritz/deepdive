Several hundred journalists and activists held a vigil in
Indonesia's capital late Thursday for BBC journalist Alan
Johnston, who was kidnapped in the Gaza Strip more than six weeks
ago.


The crowd gathered around dusk in a park in the centre of Jakarta
and lit candles in support of Johnston's release, as a message
was read from his father Graham.


"There is so much sympathy for our plight around the globe and we
are overwhelmed at such support, all of which has helped to buoy
us during these past seemingly interminable weeks," an official
from the British embassy read to the gathering on Graham's
behalf.


The vigil, organised by Indonesia's BBC office and held to mark
World Press Freedom Day, is the latest in a series of
international demonstrations in support of Johnston, now the
longest-held Westerner in Gaza.


Johnston, a veteran correspondent, taught local radio journalists
in Indonesia in 1999, part of a training team sent by the BBC
World Service.


There is still no clear indication of the 44-year-old
journalist's fate.


A little-known Islamist group claimed last month to have killed
him but other reports indicate he is alive.


Palestinian authorities said Wednesday they know his whereabouts
but are not carrying out a rescue operation because they do not
want to risk his safety.
