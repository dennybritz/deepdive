Nigeria's most high profile armed group, the Movement for the
Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), said Thursday it had
released hostages it seized overnight in an offshore attack.


"They have all been released now and are heading to Port
Harcourt. Should be there in the next 30 mins," a spokesman for
the group said in an email sent to AFP.


He said he was not sure of the nationality of the hostages.


Earlier Thursday the group said it had carried out the attack on
the Mystras, a vessel operated by ENI of Italy and Single Buoy
Moorings, in which several hostages were taken.


"The vessel was meant to have been destroyed. We have no need for
more hostages just yet," he said.


He declined responsibility for another attack in which 11
expatriate workers were taken hostage.
