The Swedish state's sale of eight percent of semi-public Swedish-
Finnish telecom operator TeliaSonera yielded 18 billion kronor
(2.67 billion dollars, 1.97 billion euros), the government said
on Thursday.


The TeliaSonera shares were sold for 50 kronor each to
institutional investors only, the government said in a statement.
The sale began Wednesday and was completed by Thursday around
midday.


The price of the share was stable on the Stockholm stock exchange
on completion of the sale at 51.50 kronor, after plunging by 6.0
percent on Wednesday.


The Swedish state remains the biggest shareholder in TeliaSonera,
the Nordic region's largest telecom operator, with 37.3 percent.
The Finnish state holds 13.7 percent.


The sale kicked off the centre-right government's privatisation
plans.


The four-party alliance that came to power in October intends to
sell all or part of the state's holdings in six companies. The
other five are banking group Nordea, OMX stock exchange, wine and
spirits manufacturer Vin & Sprit, real estate company
Vasakronan and mortgage lender SBAB.


The government has previously said it expected the sales to bring
in 150 billion kronor (16.14 billion euros, 22.2 billion dollars)
to state coffers over three years.
