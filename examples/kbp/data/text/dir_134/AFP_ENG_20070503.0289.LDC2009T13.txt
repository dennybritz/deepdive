Nickelodeon, the US children's television network, plans to
create its own theme park in the booming Gulf emirate of Dubai,
developers announced on Thursday.


The theme park is due to open in 2011 and will form part of the
Al Ahli Park leisure development under construction in Dubai, the
Al Ahli Group group said in a statement.


The developers did not state the cost or size of the theme park,
but said it would feature attractions based on popular
Nickelodeon cartoon characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants and
Dora the Explorer.


Last month, the US film studio Universal announced it was setting
up a 2.18-billion dollar theme park in the affluent city-state,
which wants to position itself as a global tourist destination.


Dubai, one of seven emirates making up the UAE, is in the midst
of a construction frenzy, with resorts, malls, sport
installations and residential complexes sprouting up across it
desert sands.
