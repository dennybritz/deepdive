A Dutch national was kidnapped overnight by unidentified
assailants from a bar in Warri, a southern Nigerian oil town,
industry sources said Thursday.


"He was taken from Flora's bar last night. He was Dutch," one
industry source told AFP.


Another source identified the man as an unemployed oil worker.


No further details were available.
