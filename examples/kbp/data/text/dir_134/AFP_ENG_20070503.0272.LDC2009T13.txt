London Mayor Ken Livingstone has secured the Labour Party's
endorsement to stand for a third straight term in office, the
party said Thursday.


The London branch of Prime Minister Tony Blair's governing party
said it had endorsed Livingstone to stand in the 2008 contest
after consulting members across the British capital.


"I am grateful for this opportunity to once more build upon the
positive agenda for London," said Livingstone, 61.


"I will be defending the international openness which has helped
London overtake New York as the world's most successful financial
centre."


Dubbed "Red Ken" for his socialist views, Livingstone has held
the mayoral post since it was established.


He failed to secure Labour's nomination for the 2000 vote and
stood as an independent. He was subsequently expelled from the
centre-left party and Blair said he would be a "disaster" for
London.


But after Livingstone trounced the Labour candidate, he was
welcomed back into the fold for the 2004 contest.


He has introduced the congestion charge, an eight-pound
(16-dollar, 11.70-euro) daily levy on driving into the city
centre and played a large part in the response to the deadly July
2005 suicide attacks.


For the centre-right Conservatives, nationally the main
opposition, former prime minister Sir John Major and former BBC
director-general Greg Dyke have both in the last fortnight turned
down the chance to stand.
