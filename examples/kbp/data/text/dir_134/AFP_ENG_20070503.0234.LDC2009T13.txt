A first poll published after a crucial televised presidential
election debate indicated Thursday that viewers found rightwinger
Nicolas Sarkozy more convincing than his socialist rival Segolene
Royal.


But Royal's campaign directors challenged the reliability of the
Opinion Way poll carried out over the Internet late Wednesday
among a sampling of 878 people.


"Who does this poll benefit?" said a statement from Jean-Louis
Bianco and Francois Rebsamen, the two campaign directors, who
suggested that the poll was biased in favor of Sarkozy.


The campaign directors said they were "outraged by these
practices. The Opinion Way institute has already showed several
times that it is unreliable," they said.


The poll showed 53 percent found Sarkozy "more convincing"
against 31 percent who thought the same of Royal.


An additional 16 percent said neither of them won them over or
declined to respond.


Sarkozy, who is leading in the polls, sparred with Royal before
more than 20 million viewers during the debate held ahead of
Sunday's vote.


Royal went on the offensive, challenging Sarkozy on his record as
a member of the outgoing government and angrily accusing him of
"political immorality."


Both candidates sought to address their weaknesses during the
debate: Royal had to dispel doubts about her presidential stature
while Sarkozy faces concerns over his hyper-active personality.
