Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has admitted to being
bored after almost a year out of work and is ready to take a "big
job" in the English Premiership.


Eriksson handed over the reins to assistant Steve McClaren after
last year's World Cup, when a lacklustre England were eliminated
by Portugal in the quarter- finals.


He is still being paid compensation by the Football Association
but the Swede is looking for a way back into the game.


Asked if he would be prepared to endure the same public scrutiny
of his private life he suffered in charge of England and take
charge of an English club, Eriksson told Talksport: "I'm very
stubborn, I will take a good job wherever it is, even if it is in
England.


"I hope to be back in football next season because I love
football. Yes, I would take a big job wherever - I wouldn't say I
was fed up but I'm a little bit bored."


Eriksson endorsed McClaren's stewardship of England and he
believes the former Middlesbrough boss will take the country to
Euro 2008.


He declined to support or criticise McClaren's decision to drop
David Beckham - Eriksson's captain - but did say: "I saw David
playing with Real Madrid last weekend and he looked fantastic."
