Rosneft bought key production and refining units from bankrupt
oil group Yukos for 6.8 billion dollars at an auction on
Thursday, an auction official said of a deal that according to
analysts will make the state-controlled firm Russia's largest oil
producer.


The result of the auction, shown live on a screen at Yukos
headquarters in Moscow, included the sale of Tomskneft, the East
Siberian Oil and Gas company and other major assets in eastern
Siberia and was announced by Russia's state property agency, the
organizer of the sale.
