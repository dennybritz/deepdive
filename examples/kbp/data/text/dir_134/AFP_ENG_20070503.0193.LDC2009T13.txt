Sri Lanka's Supreme Court Thursday stripped former president
Chandrika Kumaratunga of her official staff and 36 government
cars, saying that she was not entitled to extravagant privileges.


A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Sarath Silva held
that it was also illegal for her to occupy a state bungalow
refurbished at huge cost to the state.


Kumaratunga completed two terms as the all-powerful executive
president in November 2005 and was succeeded by her prime
minister Mahinda Rajapakse. The two are from the same party, but
are seen as having a serious personality clash.


"The Supreme Court also ordered the former president to pay
100,000 rupees (925 dollars) to three individuals who filed the
case challenging the state privileges accorded to her," a court
official said.


Three lawyers petitioned the court last year, arguing that the
fundamental rights of the 20 million people in Sri Lanka were
violated as a result of the extravagant spending on Kumaratunga.


The former president retained a staff of 198 and used 36 vehicles
after she stepped down. The constitution allows a former
president to use two cars and a staff of about 25.


Last year, Kumaratunga said she had returned the gift of a prime
property located near parliament and was moving to a state
bungalow at Colombo's fashionable Independence Square area.
