US toddlers tuning in for a Disney cartoon in the state of New
Jersey this week got more than they bargained for, when the local
cable company mistakenly started broadcasting hardcore
pornography.


According to the New York Daily News, "Handy Manny," a cartoon on
Playhouse Disney about a Latino handyman and his talking tools,
broke off on Monday morning when Comcast mistakenly started
airing an x-rated movie.


One subscriber, Paul Dunleavy, told the newspaper he realized
something was awry was when his five-year-old son asked him:
"What are they doing?"


"It was two people doing their thing, it was full-on and it was
disgusting," Dunleavy said.


"I couldn't believe it. We try to do the right thing to protect
our kids from this stuff, and then they broadcast it on
children's TV," Dunleavy said.


A Comcast spokesman told the newspaper the programming error was
the cable company's fault, and that Playhouse Disney, which is
pitched at children aged three to six, was not to blame.


"We immediately detected the issue and it was corrected
promptly," he said, adding that the incident was under
investigation.


Dunleavy, however, was not satisfied. "I try to protect my kids
from a lot of things, but I wouldn't have thought Disney would
become one of them."
