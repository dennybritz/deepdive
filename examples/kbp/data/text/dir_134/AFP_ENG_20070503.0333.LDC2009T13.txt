A Greek court Thursday dismissed the appeal of extreme-left
November 17 group leader Alexander Giotopoulos against his 2003
conviction for inspiring the organisation's deadly attacks.


The court, which will rule in a few days if it is upholding the
life sentence handed down against Giotopoulos, 63, issued its
verdict after 18 months of hearings by five judges.


The court also heard appeals by 16 other alleged members of
November 17, most of whom had been sentenced to long prison terms
in 2003.


They were found guilty of carrying out a series of attacks
against Greek and foreign targets, including 19 murders, between
1983 and 2000 for a nationalist Marxist cause.


Giotopoulos, who fought the 1967-74 military dictatorship known
as the colonels' regime, claimed he was victim of a "US and
British plot."


The court also confirmed the verdicts of 13 other members of the
group, including its operations chief, Dimitris Koufontinas, who
was sentenced to prison indefinitely in 2003.


However, the verdicts of four others, including Angeliki
Sotiropoulou, the only woman in the group, were overturned.


She and a former member of the group, Yannis Serifis, won their
appeals as did Niko Papanastassiou and Pavlos Serifis.


The latter pair were sentenced to between eight and 10 years in
prison. Founder members of November 17, the two men said they had
left the group in the early 1980s.
