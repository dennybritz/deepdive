Russian mining group Norilsk Nickel on Thursday announced a
takeover bid for Canadian nickel producer LionOre, offering 16.2
percent more than a March bid by Anglo-Swiss group Xstrata.


Norilsk's cash bid of 21.5 Canadian dollars per share values the
company at 5.3 billion Canadian dollars (4.8 US billion dollars,
3.5 billion euros), the company said in a statement.


Xstrata, which bid 18.5 Canadian dollars per share, valuing the
company at 4.6 billion Canadian dollars, says it has secured the
agreement of a number of LionOre's shareholders.


An international gold and nickel producer, LionOre has operations
in Australia, Botswana and South Africa.
