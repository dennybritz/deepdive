EU regulators approved on Thursday Norwegian oil company
Statoil's takeover of the oil and gas activities of Norsk Hydro,
judging that the deal would not stifle competition.


"After examining the operation, the (European) commission
concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede
effective competition," the EU antitrust watchdog said.


The two groups announced in December that state-controlled
Statoil would buy the oil and gas activities of Norsk Hydro to
create the world's largest offshore production group in a deal
worth an estimated 23 billion euros (30 billion dollars).


Together, Norway's two largest oil groups would have combined
production of 1.9 million barrels per day in 2007 and 31,000
employees, the companies said at the time.


Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is subject to the
bloc's antitrust regulations as a member of the European Economic
Area, which includes the EU's 27 members, Iceland, Liechtenstein
and Norway.
