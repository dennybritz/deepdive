There will be at least one German on the pitch when England play
their first game at Wembley against Brazil next month after it
was announced on Thursday that Markus Merk will referee the
match.


Although German team manager Oliver Bierhoff initially announced
last month that Germany would play England in the first
international at Wembley in August, the FA usurped the
announcement with news of the visit of Brazil on June 1.


But 45-year-old Merk, who has refereed in two World Cups, is
looking forward to taking charge of England's first international
at the new 90,000-seater Wembley against the flamboyant South
Americans.


"It's a huge honour and a real privilege," said the whistle-
blower.


Work on Wembley was finished this spring after a four-year
reconstruction programme costing 800 million pounds (1.59 billion
dollars).
