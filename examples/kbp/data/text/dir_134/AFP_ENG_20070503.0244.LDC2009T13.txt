Chelsea star Andriy Shevchenko accepted libel damages from a
British newspaper Thursday after it claimed that he was a
"dressing room spy" for the club's tycoon owner Roman Abramovich.


The Ukraine striker took legal action against the Daily Mirror,
which also alleged that fellow players blamed him for a row
between Abramovich and the club's manager Jose Mourinho.


The tabloid also claimed that Shevchenko had wanted Abramovich to
replace Mourinho with Carlo Ancelotti, the coach of his former
club AC Milan.


Despite complaints from Shevchenko's lawyers, the paper then went
on to print allegations that he had complained about Mourinho and
would have been happy to leave Chelsea on loan last year,
London's High Court heard.


His lawyer, John Kelly, told the court that Shevchenko did not
make any of the statements attributed to him in reports this
year.


The claims had damaged his reputation, upset him and his family
and created embarrassment at his club, Kelly added.


The newspaper's owners, MGN Limited, accepted that the
allegations were untrue, apologised and will pay undisclosed
damages, as well as the player's costs.


Shevchenko, the 2004 European footballer of the year, joined
Chelsea from Italian giants AC Milan in 2006 for 30 million
pounds (44 million euros, 60 million dollars), a British record.
