US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Thursday went into a
meeting with her Syrian counterpart Walid Muallem, an AFP
journalist reported.


Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit escorted the two
officials into a meeting room and left them shortly afterwards.


The last high-ranking US official to hold talks with Syrian
officials was then deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage,
who travelled to Damascus in January 2005.
