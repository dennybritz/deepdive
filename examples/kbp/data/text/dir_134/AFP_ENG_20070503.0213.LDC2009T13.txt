The chief executive at German telecom giant Deutsche Telekom said
Thursday he would go without two months' salary, which the
company said amounts to 204,000 dollars, to show solidarity with
workers facing pay cuts.


"I want to show my particular responsibility as chairman of the
board and forfeit two months' salary," Rene Obermann told the
company's annual general meeting.


He said his fellow board members had agreed to have one month's
salary deducted from their pay packets to show their support for
workers involved in an ongoing cost-cutting programme.


A Deutsche Telekom spokeswoman said Obermann would forfeit at
least 150,000 euros (204,000 dollars).


Obermann, promoted to the top job from the company's T-Mobile
unit last November, was given a hostile reception at the start of
the meeting from small- scale shareholders.


Telekom's plan to slash entry-level wages by around one third to
decrease staff costs has faced intense criticism from unions that
have threatened strikes.


Telekom is also planning to spin off up to 50,000 staff to its
newly created T-Service customer service division.


The measures introduced by Europe's biggest telecommunications
operator are designed to face up to a collapse in its fixed-line
business.


Net profit last year slumped 43 percent to 3.165 billion euros.
