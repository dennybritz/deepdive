England's build-up to their must-win Euro 2008 qualifier in
Estonia will include a meeting between a 'B' selection and
Albania at Burnley's Turf Moor ground on May 25, the Football
Association announced on Thursday.


The timing of the match rules out both Steven Gerrard and Jamie
Carragher, who will be in action for Liverpool in the Champions
League final in Athens two days earlier.


England are due to play Brazil a week after the Albania match in
the first international at Wembley stadium since completion of
its reconstruction.


The squad will then head to Estonia for a match seen as crucial
to England's chances of reaching the finals of Euro 2008 in
Switzerland and Austria, and to the future of under-pressure head
coach Steve McClaren.
