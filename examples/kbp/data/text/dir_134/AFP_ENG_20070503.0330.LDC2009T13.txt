A gas explosion Thursday on a minibus in southwest Russia killed
three people and injured at least nine, Russian news agencies
reported.


RIA Novosti quoted traffic police spokeswoman Tatyana Korolyova
saying that an earlier report of 11 deaths and three injuries had
proved incorrect.


The accident occurred when the gas tank on the bus exploded
during a collision with another vehicle at the side of the road
in the Samara region, RIA Novosti and ITAR-TASS news agencies
quoted police as saying.


Differing reports referred to nine and 10 injuries.


Cars and buses converted to run on natural gas, a cheaper option
amid rising petrol prices, are a common in Russia.
