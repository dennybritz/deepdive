Bangladesh Nobel Peace Prize winner and micro-credit pioneer
Muhammad Yunus Thursday announced that he had abandoned his plan
to form a political party.


"I decided to enter into politics because of your support," Yunus
said in an open letter. "Now... I am informing you that I am not
going to form any political party."


"I had a plan... but I came to understand that it is not possible
and so accepting this reality I decided not to go forward," he
added.


Yunus and his Grameen Bank, which specialises in lifting people
out of extreme poverty by giving small loans to the very poor,
were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize last October.


Bangladesh has been ruled by a military-backed emergency
government since January after a political crisis led to
elections being cancelled.


Yunus had pledged that his party would offer an alternative to
the two main political parties which have dominated Bangladesh's
notoriously dysfunctional politics for decades.


Critics of the two parties -- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) and the Awami League -- say their confrontational approach
and failure to tackle corruption damaged democracy in the country
and led to January's crisis.
