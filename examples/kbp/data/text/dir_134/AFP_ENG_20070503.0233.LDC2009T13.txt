Spain's gross domestic product expanded 4.0 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the same rate as in the last quarter
of last year, the central bank said Thursday.


Domestic consumption and external demand continued to post
similar levels as in the fourth quarter, the Bank of Spain said
in a monthly report on the economy.


The growth figure is in line with the government forecast for the
quarter. Last month Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero said the economy had expaned by "about four percent" in
the first three months of 2007.


The national statistics institute will publish preliminary first
quarter GDP figures on May 14 and the final official data on May
23.


The Spanish economy expanded 3.9 percent in 2006, making it one
of Europe's strongest economies that year, and the government
predicts it will grow by over 3.5 percent this year.
