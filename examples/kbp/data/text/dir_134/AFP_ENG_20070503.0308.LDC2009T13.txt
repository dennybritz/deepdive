Four Asians working for the US government -- two Indians, a
Filipino and a Nepalese -- were killed in a rocket attack on
Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, the embassy reported on
Thursday.


Earlier, the embassy had identified all the dead as Filipinos,
but later corrected the news release.


"Following this morning's initial condolence message ... it was
learned that the dead were one Philippine citizen, two from India
and one from Nepal. All were employed by a US government
contractor," the embassy said.


The rocket attack took place Wednesday after several days of
mortar attacks against the Green Zone, a walled city district
that serves as the seat of the Iraqi government as well as the US
and British embassies.


The Asians died on the same day that a US military spokesman
warned that insurgent gunners were trying "to score a spectacular
hit or obtain a headline grabbing direct hit" on a Green Zone
target.


Both Sunni and Shiite armed groups periodically launch attacks
against the area, although US Rear Admiral Mark Fox denied the
latest attacks were part of a concerted effort by anti-American
forces.


"It's more than potshots, but not a campaign," he said.
