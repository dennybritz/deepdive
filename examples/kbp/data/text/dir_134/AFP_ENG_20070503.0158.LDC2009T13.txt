Singapore Airlines (SIA) said Thursday it will raise its fuel
surcharge from next week due to rising jet oil prices, less than
two months after the last increase.


The fuel levy will increase by two to seven US dollars for
tickets issued from May 9 onwards, the flag carrier said in a
statement.


"As a result of a sustained escalation in the price of jet fuel
in recent months, Singapore Airlines will increase its fuel
surcharge for tickets issued on or after May 9, 2007," SIA said.


"The adjustments will offer only partial relief of higher
operating costs arising from recent increases in the price of jet
fuel."


For flights from Singapore to Southeast Asia, the levy will be
raised from 18 dollars to 20 dollars while the surcharge for
tickets to North America will be hiked by seven dollars to 89
dollars.


The surcharge for other destinations will be raised by four
dollars to 58 dollars.
