Japan's Hozumi Hasegawa pounded out a unanimous decision victory
over Simpiwe Vetyeka of South Africa to defend his World Boxing
Council (WBC) bantamweight title Thursday.


It was his fourth defence of the title he wrested from 14-time
champion Veeraphol Nakhonluang of Thailand in April 2005, and it
salvaged the disappointment of local fans after defeats of Nobuo
Nashiro and Nobuhito Honmo.


Nashiro lost the World Boxing Association (WBA) super flyweight
title to Alexander Munoz of Venezuela earlier in the day, while
Honmo crashed to WBA featherweight champion Edwin Valero of
Venezuela in a technical knockout.


Hasegawa stretched his record to 22 wins, including seven KOs,
against two defeats, while Vetyeka, ranked fourth in the WBC,
suffered the first defeat of his career after winning 16, nine of
them inside the distance.
