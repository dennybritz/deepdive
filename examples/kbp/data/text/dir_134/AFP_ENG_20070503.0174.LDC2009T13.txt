Anglo-Dutch food giant Unilever reported on Thursday a 1.0
percent net profit increase in the first quarter of 2007 to 1.074
billion euros compared with 1.059 billion in the same period last
year.


Pretax profit came in at 1.332 billion euros (1.813 billion
dollars), compared with 1.31 billion euros the previous year.


The results were consistent with market expectations.


Earnings per share were 0.35 euros, an increase of 2.0 percent
over the first quarter of 2006.


Sales at Unilever, which makes Knorr soups, Lipton tea and Magnum
ice-cream, fell slightly to 9.528 billion euros from 9.535
billion euros the previous year.


Currency movements reduced sales by 5 percent and earnings per
share by 3 percent, it said.


Chief executive Patrick Cescau said Unilever had experienced a
good start to 2007, with broad-based sales growth across
different regions and categories and improved margin development
driven by home and personal care.


Looking ahead, Cescau warned of "a significant headwind from
rising agricultural commodity costs which may require further
pricing action".


In London trading Unilever headed the FTSE 100 early on on the
news, jumping 4.76 percent to 1,630 pence.
