Britain's Queen Elizabeth II left London Thursday for the United
States, where she was to make her first state visit in 16 years,
Buckingham Palace said.


The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, left Heathrow airport
at around midday (1100 GMT) on a specially-chartered British
Airways flight, a spokeswoman told AFP.


The party was due to arrive in Richmond, Virginia at around
3:00pm local time (1900 GMT) to be met by the state's governor,
Tim Kaine, and launch straight into a programme of official
engagements.


She was due to be welcomed by a showcase of blues, jazz,
bluegrass and gospel music in the town's Capitol Square.


The six-day trip comes weeks after the shootings at Virginia Tech
that saw 32 students and teachers killed by student Cho Seung-
Hui.


The queen will pay tribute to the victims of the massacre during
her trip to the state, but will not visit the campus.
