Two security officers have been shot dead by suspected Islamic
rebels in Thailand's restive Muslim-majority south, police said
Thursday.


A 50-year-old police sergeant was killed in a parked car after a
group of militants sprayed the vehicle with bullets Thursday in
Pattani, one of three insurgency-torn southern provinces
bordering Malaysia, they said.


In nearby Narathiwat province, a 24-year-old soldier was gunned
down after insurgents stormed into his wife's house late
Wednesday, police said, adding he was killed following a
10-minute gunfight.


Police added a 35-year-old Buddhist man died early Thursday,
becoming the second fatality from a bomb attack in Pattani on
Monday. More than 20 people were wounded when a bomb, hidden in a
motorcycle, exploded at a night market.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in three years of unrest
in the three southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani.


The military-backed government, which came to power after a
September coup, has made peace-building efforts in a bid to rein
in the insurgency, but violence has escalated over the past six
months.


On Tuesday, the government said it would grant amnesty to
suspected Islamic rebels in the restive south in its latest
reconciliatory effort to contain the long-running insurgency.
