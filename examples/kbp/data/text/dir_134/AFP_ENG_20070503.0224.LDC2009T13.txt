A Greek court Thursday dismissed the appeal of extreme-left
November 17 group leader Alexander Giotopoulos against his 2003
conviction for inspiring the organisation's deadly attacks.


The court, which will rule in a few days if it is upholding the
life sentence handed down against Giotopoulos, 63, issued its
verdict after 18 months of hearings by five judges.
