Proteins, the complex molecules of life, have been sequenced into
classical music, researchers in the US reported on Thursday.


Rie Takahashi and Jeffrey Miller of the University of California,
Los Angeles, used parts of amino acids -- the building blocks of
proteins -- to devise a 20-note range spanning two octaves.


Their inspiration: thymidylate synthase A, or ThyA, a protein
that in a flawed form plays a part in types of cancer.


The work builds on previous innovation, using the code for DNA.
But DNA has only four potential "notes" -- the compounds that
make up the rungs on the double- helix ladder -- and this is
musically limiting.


Takahashi and Miller believe their brainchild will be useful for
getting young people interested in genomic biology.


They have also set up a browser that allows anyone to send in a
sequence coding for a protein that is then converted into music
and returned to the inquirer as a "midi" file, or music that is
transcribed into a standard software format.


Proteins can be qualified as the stuff of life, not just
comprising almost all of the body's tissues but also performing
myriad roles as signallers, repairers and destroyers, too.
