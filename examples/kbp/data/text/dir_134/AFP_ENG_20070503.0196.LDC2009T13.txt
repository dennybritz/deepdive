Gunshots were fired close to the official residence of Indian
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday but the incident was a
personal dispute unrelated to the premier, police said.


"This has got nothing to do with the security of the prime
minister's house, as it was a private dispute," police spokesman
Deependra Pathak told AFP.


Pathak said one "civilian" was injured in the shooting at a
petrol station several hundred metres (yards) from Singh's
official residence in New Delhi. He said the man was hospitalised
for treatment.


The premier was not at home and staff at his residence said they
had not heard the shooting. The leafy compound, which has a
three-tier security cordon, is guarded by some 400 commandos.


"There was no breach in the PM's security. The incident happened
quite a distance from here," a staff member at the residence, who
asked not to be named, told AFP by telephone.


The Indian prime minister is one of the most closely guarded
politicians in the country, which has a history of high-level
assassinations.


In 1984, India's then prime minister Indira Gandhi was shot dead
by two of her security guards. Her son Rajiv Gandhi was also
killed by a suicide bomber in 1991 while campaigning for a second
term as premier.


Security for Singh was also increased further after an incident
last July when three ordinary people who wanted to meet the PM
breached the first security cordon at his heavily fortified
residence.
