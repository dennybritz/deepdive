A court ruled Monday that a new lawsuit against jailed Russian
oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky should be heard in Moscow rather
than eastern Siberia in a minor victory for his legal team.


Judges at the Moscow City Court confirmed a lower court's
decision that Khodorkovsky, founder of bankrupt oil giant Yukos,
should be tried in Moscow rather than the town of Chita where he
is being held, spokeswoman Anna Usachova told AFP.


"The decision means that Khodorkovsky must be transferred to
Moscow," Khodorkovsky's lawyer Yury Schmidt said by telephone.


Prosecutors may still appeal the decision, however.


Once Russia's richest man, Khodorkovsky is serving an eight-year
prison sentence in a Siberian camp near the Chinese border after
being convicted in May 2005 of embezzlement and other financial
crimes.


New charges were presented to Khodorkovsky by Russian prosecutors
in the eastern Siberian city of Chita, where he has been held in
a pre-trial detention facility since December.


Supporters say the location, more than 6,000 kilometres (3,730
miles) from Moscow, was chosen to make news coverage of the case
more difficult and lawyers have argued that it should be heard in
Moscow.


Yukos, the oil firm Khodorkovsky built up into Russia's largest
private company, has been dismembered by the Russian courts and
bankrupted to pay alleged debts to Russian tax authorities since
his arrest in 2003.


The case was seen by Kremlin critics as a politically-driven
attack on an ambitious and influential businessman who had become
critical of President Vladimir Putin.
