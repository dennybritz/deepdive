US consumers appeared to regain some of their legendary appetite
for shopping last month as retail sales spiked by a more-than-
expected 0.7 percent, the government reported Monday.


The Commerce Department's monthly snapshot on retail sales, a key
driver of economic growth, defied most Wall Street analysts who
had only anticipated a 0.4 percent rise in sales.


The sales gain was also the strongest since December, when sales
are heavily bolstered by shoppers snapping up Christmas gifts.


Stripping out auto sales from the February report, retail sales
gained 0.8 percent, a shade better than most analysts had
forecast.


Upward revisions to February retail sales were also likely to
cheer investors as the government said it had revised February
retail sales up several notches to 0.5 percent.


The retail sales report was likely to be welcomed by Wall Street
as it appears to show American consumers' flocked to shopping
malls last month despite a housing market slump and high gasoline
prices.


Over the past 12 months, overall retail sales are up 3.8 percent
or 3.9 percent excluding the auto sector.
