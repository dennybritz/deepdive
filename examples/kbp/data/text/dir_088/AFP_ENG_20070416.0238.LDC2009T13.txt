Iran on Monday pardoned two Swedish nationals jailed for
photographing military installations last year and will release
them later in the day, the foreign ministry spokesman said.


"Within the framework of the humanitarian efforts of Iran and
following the requests of the family and repeated requests from
Swedish politicians... they have been pardoned and will be freed
at 6:00 pm" (1530 GMT), foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali
Hosseini said in a statement.


The two men, named as Stefan Johanssen and Jari Hjortmar, were
arrested in March 2006 for taking pictures of military
installations on Iran's southern island of Qeshm and sentenced to
two years in prison.


Their release comes less than two weeks after 15 British naval
personnel held by Iran on accusations of illegally entering
Iranian waters were suddenly pardoned and released.


Two other Europeans, German tourist Donald Klein and French boat
skipper Stephane Lherbier, were also both freed earlier this year
before completing 18-month sentences for violating Iran's
territorial waters.
