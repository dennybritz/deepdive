A US university in Virginia said Monday a shooting on its campus
had left multiple victims, urging students to stay behind closed
doors in a website announcement.


There has been "a multiple shooting with multiple victims," said
Virginia Tech, adding one gunman had already been arrested and
police were searching for a second shooter.
