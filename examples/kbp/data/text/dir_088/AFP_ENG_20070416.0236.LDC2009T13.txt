US Defence Secretary Robert Gates arrived in Jordan on Monday at
the start of a three-nation Middle East tour officials said was
aimed at confronting Iran's influence in the region and pledging
support for the government of Iraq.


"Jordan has always been an ally of the United States," Gates told
reporters on the plane ahead of landing in Amman. "The Jordanians
have for a long time been a very constructive influence and I
look forward to continuing that."


He said he looked forward to speaking with Jordan's King Abdullah
II about "how we can contribute to his (peace) efforts and how
the Jordanians can contribute to ours, not just in Iraq but in
Lebanon (and) the Palestinian peace process."


Gates will meet top military officials in Jordan, Egypt and
Israel on a trip that will also seek to reassure the three
countries of Washington's continued support, US officials said.
