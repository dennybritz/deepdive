Nearly 101,000 people immigrated to the Netherlands last year,
marking an increase for the fourth year, statistics showed on
Monday.


Although 10,000 more people immigrated to the Netherlands in 2006
than in the previous year, last year's figure was still well
below the 130,000 seen in 2000 and 2001, the central statistics
office said.


Dutch people returning home made up the biggest immigrant group,
followed by those from Eastern Europe, especially Poles.


The office said tougher immigration laws had slowed down the flow
of immigrants from countries such as Morocco, Turkey and the
former Dutch colony of Surinam.
