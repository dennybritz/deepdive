Rival Ivory Coast leaders on Monday started dismantling a buffer
zone that has divided the West African country for four years
since a failed coup sparked a civil war.


Arch-rivals turned partners-in-government, President Laurent
Gbagbo and Prime Minister Guillaume Soro presided over ceremonies
for the landmark event, enshrined in the country's UN-backed
peace process.


The buffer zone has been patrolled by UN peacekeepers to separate
Soro's rebels in the north of the country and Gbagbo's government
forces in the south.


The United Nations created the so-called "confidence zone" in
2002 to end a brief civil war after a failed coup attempt by Soro
to topple Gbagbo.
