The British Broadcasting Corporation said Monday it remained
"highly concerned" for the safety of its kidnapped Gaza
correspondent Alan Johnston after a Palestinian group said it had
killed him.


"The BBC has still had no independent verification of rumours
concerning Alan Johnston," it said in a statement.


"We continue to be highly concerned for his safety and are
working closely with the Palestinian and British authorities to
seek urgent clarification."


Johnston, 44, was kidnapped at gunpoint on March 12 as he drove
home in Gaza City.


A group called Kataeb al-Jihad al-Tawheed (The Brigades of Holy
War and Unity) said in a statement issued to news outlets Sunday
that it had executed the reporter.


Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman
said: "People on the ground... are actively engaged into looking
into (the reports of Johnston's execution).


"We continue to work extremely closely with the Palestinian
Authority and we are urgently seeking information through them
and other sources on these reports."


A BBC spokeswoman told AFP that a staff rally for Johnston was
being held at its west London headquarters and at the central
London offices of BBC World Service radio at 2:15 pm (1315 GMT).


BBC director-general Mark Thompson has been keeping staff updated
on developments with a regular e-mail.


On Monday he said: "Everyone across the BBC will be deeply
concerned at the latest report."


"At this stage we're treating this as rumour."
