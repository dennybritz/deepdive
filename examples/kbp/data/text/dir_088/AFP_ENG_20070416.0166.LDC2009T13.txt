The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on
Monday it was maintaining its forecast for growth of world oil
demand in 2007 unchanged at 1.5 percent.


In its monthly report for April the 11-member exporters' group
said it was noting a drop of oil inventories in America and
Europe.


The estimates showed that world oil demand in 2007 was expected
grow by 1.5 percent to 85.44 million barrels per day (bpd).
