Japan's Nissan Motor Co. expects to push back its target of
selling 4.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year March 2009, a
spokeswoman said Monday.


The goal, which is part of the automaker's three-year "Value-Up"
business plan unveiled in 2005, is now expected to be met one
year later, she said.


The new target is expected to be officially announced on April 26
alongside Nissan's annual results.


Nissan, which is 44 percent owned by France's Renault, warned
investors in February that net profits were expected to slide by
over 11 percent in the year to March 2007 due to poor sales,
particularly in its home market.
