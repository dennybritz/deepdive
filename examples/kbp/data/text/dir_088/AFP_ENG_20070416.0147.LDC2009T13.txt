Britain's Barclays Bank announced Monday the sale of its trust
administration and custody operations in Japan to Sumitomo Trust
and Banking Co. for about 4.9 billion yen (41 million dollars).


Barclays Global Investors will take over the asset management
services of the subsidiary, Barclays Global Investors Japan Trust
and Banking Co., before it is sold to Sumitomo, the British bank
said in a statement.


The deal is expected to be completed near the end of 2007 subject
to regulatory approval, it added.
