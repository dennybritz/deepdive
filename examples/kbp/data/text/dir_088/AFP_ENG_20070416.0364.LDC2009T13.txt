A Guinean military fighter plane crashed on Monday into a suburb
of the capital of the west African country, government and
witnesses said.


"A MiG came down around 11:30 am (GMT) on an RTG (Guinea Radio
and Television) building," Communication Minister Justin Morel
Junior told AFP.


"The two pilots escaped and are alive," he said, adding there
were "some slight injuries in the panic that followed the
collision (involving) broken glass."


No casualties were reported on the ground either.


"We have neither deaths nor casualties. We have been very lucky
because only the roof of a wing of the building was hit,"
television director Yamoussa Sidibe told AFP.


The accident took place during regular military drills, said
minister Junior.


Witnesses said the MiG 21 burst into flames when it came down on
part of the building which houses the country's RTG state radio
and television station, and in front of the US embassy in the
Ratoma suburb.


Fire fighters put out the flames, but hours after the accident
the wreck of the plane had yet to be pulled down, according to an
AFP correspondent at the scene.


Junior said the Chinese ambassador to Conakry has promised to
help with the repairs of the Russian-made aircraft.


The army regularly undertakes training exercises around the
capital.
