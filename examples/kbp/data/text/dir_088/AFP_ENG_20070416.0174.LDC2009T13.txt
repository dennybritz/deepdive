French intelligence services warned their US counterparts, eight
months before the attacks of September 11, 2001, that Al-Qaeda
was planning to hijack a US- bound plane, a media report said
Monday.


The information that Osama bin Laden's group, working with
Taliban militants and Chechen rebels, had been plotting the move
was passed on to the head of the Central Intelligence Agency's
Paris bureau, Le Monde daily said.


The paper published a copy of the first page of a five-page
document it said had been handed over to the CIA by the French
foreign intelligence agency, the DGSE


The DGSE declined to comment when contacted by AFP.
