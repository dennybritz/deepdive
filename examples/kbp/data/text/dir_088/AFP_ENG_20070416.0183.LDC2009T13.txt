Nepal's Maoists, who were recently given ministerial roles in a
new parliament, need to end violence and intimidation against gay
men and women, a rights group said Monday.


"As Nepal tries to recover from a decade of conflict, its leaders
should make it clear that no one's rights are disposable,"
Jessica Stern, a researcher with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch, said in a
statement.


The New York-based rights group issued the statement after it had
received reports that Maoists abducted, tortured and tried to
forcibly recruit a woman and a teenage girl in March they accused
of having a lesbian relationship.


The Maoists have also faced charges of forcibly recruiting
children during a decade-long people's war.


"Abusing women for their sexuality and forcibly recruiting
children are simply unacceptable in a new Nepal," said Stern.


After King Gyanendra was forced to end a 14-month period of
direct rule last April, the former rebels signed a peace deal
with the government late last year to end a civil war that had
killed at least 13,000 people.


Although homosexuality is not listed as a crime under Nepali law,
"unnatural sex acts" can be punished here by up to a year in
prison.
