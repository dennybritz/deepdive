Bank of America and China Construction Bank, the nation's third-
largest lender, plan to set up credit-card joint venture, the
Chinese lender said Monday.


China Construction Bank said Bank of America will initially help
oversee the establishment and operation of a new credit card unit
and provide consulting services as well, it said in a statement.


The business unit will eventually be converted into a credit card
joint venture, in which China Construction Bank will hold 63
percent while Bank of America will have 37 percent, it said.


The bank said it more than doubled the number of credit cards it
issued to 6.34 million in 2006 and spending on its cards also
more than doubled to 40.47 billion yuan (5.24 billion dollars).


China Construction Bank, in which Bank of America holds an 8.52
percent stake, raised 9.2 billion dollars from a listing in Hong
Kong in October 2005.
