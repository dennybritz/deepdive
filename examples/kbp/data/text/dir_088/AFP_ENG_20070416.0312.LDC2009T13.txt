Ireland's World Cup wins over Pakistan and Bangladesh have earned
them a place on the International Cricket Council (ICC) ODI
championship table.


Their 74-run win over Bangladesh here on Sunday means they will
be on the official rankings list that will be updated after their
final Super Eights game, against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.


Ireland graduate from the ICC Associate rankings and joins Kenya
as the only non-Test countries in the full ODI championship.


An Associate can be promoted when it has played at least ten one-
day internationals and has beaten two Full Members, or has
defeated one Full Member and won more than 60% of its games
against other Associates.


Having upset Pakistan in their group match, Ireland needed only
one more win to take the next step.


In accordance with a previous ICC decision, Ireland has ODI
status until 2009, along with the other top Associate Members -
Kenya, Scotland, Netherlands, Canada and Bermuda.
