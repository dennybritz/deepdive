US stocks opened higher Monday as sentiment was lifted by news on
the takeover front, generally strong earnings from Citigroup and
a better-than-expected report on retail sales.


In opening market action, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbed 50.38 points (0.40 percent) to 12,662.51 and the Nasdaq
composite increased 13.62 points (0.55 percent) to 2,505.56.


The Standard and Poor's 500 index added 6.74 points (0.46
percent) to 1,459.59.


Wall Street was helped by gains in Asia and Europe overnight as
well as news of a 25-billion-dollar private equity deal for US
student loan finance group Sallie Mae.


Meanwhile data showed US retail sales spiked by a more-than-
expected 0.7 percent, and banking giant Citigroup topped most
forecasts with a quarterly profit of 5.01 billion dollars.


"The market enters the heavy part of earnings season with
optimism and modest momentum," said Dick Green at Briefing.com.


But Green said that because of a cloudy economic outlook, "We
aren't convinced that the good times will continue into May or
the summer months."
