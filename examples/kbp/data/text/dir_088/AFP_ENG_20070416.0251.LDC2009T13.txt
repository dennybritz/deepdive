Republic of Ireland winger Damian Duff's season is over following
an ankle injury, his Newscastle team said Monday.


The 28-year-old was injured during his team's 2-1 defeat at
Portsmouth on Saturday and left the field limping.


He underwent an X-ray, after which manager Glenn Roeder confirmed
he would miss the rest of the season.


"While an X-ray has shown there is no break, Damien has a badly
swollen ankle and our medical people tell us that he will not be
able to play again this season," Roeder told the club's official
website.


"It's bad luck for Damien coming at a time when he was beginning
to show the sort of form we have been looking for from him."
