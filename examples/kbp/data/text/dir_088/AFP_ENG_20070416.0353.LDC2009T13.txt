One hundred employees of Swiss telecoms operator Sunrise were
evacuated from their Zurich offices on Monday after a letter was
delivered containing suspicious white powder, leading to fears it
could be anthrax, police said.


Tests were taking place to establish the true nature of the
powder.


A similar incident took place last week when two mobile phone
shops in Basel also received powder-filled envelopes, but this
turned out to be a false alarm.
