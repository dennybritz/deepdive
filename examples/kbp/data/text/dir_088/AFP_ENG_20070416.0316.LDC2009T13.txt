Two Danish ministers on Monday proposed that Denmark become a
safe haven for writers, journalists and cartoonists in need of
protection by granting them temporary asylum.


Writing in the daily Jyllands-Posten, Culture Minister Brian
Mikkelsen and Refugee, Immigration and Integration Minister Rikke
Hvilshoej said Denmark should join an international network of
cities offering persecuted writers and journalists temporary
asylum.


The aim is to enable writers to continue their work without any
obstruction to their freedom of expression.


The International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN) consists of 17
cities around the world, including Stockholm, Oslo, Frankfurt,
Edinburgh, Hanover, Stavanger and Mexico City.


The ministers said it was "important to protect the right to free
speech, especially when it is under massive pressure," a
reference to the Mohammed cartoons crisis sparked by the
publication of 12 caricatures of the prophet in Jyllands-Posten
in 2005.


The government was to present a bill later this year that would
enable journalists, cartoonists and writers to live in Danish
cities taking part in the network for two years without having to
go through normal asylum procedures.


According to the ministers, the cities taking part in the ICORN
network commit themselves to offer dissidents and their families'
food and shelter.
