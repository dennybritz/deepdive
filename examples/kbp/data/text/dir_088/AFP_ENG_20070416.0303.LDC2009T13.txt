Russia on Monday officially requested the extradition from
Britain of exiled billionaire Boris Berezovsky following his call
last week for "direct action" to overthrow President Vladimir
Putin, news agencies reported.


"Today I signed an international legal order in which we posed
the question of the extradition of Mr. Berezovsky," Prosecutor
General Yury Chaika told the Interfax news agency.


Chaika said he "drew attention to the unacceptable way he is
using his status and adopted country as a base for provocative
actions against Russia."


In the request, Russia asked for a "legal evaluation of the
actions of Mr. Berezovsky and the withdrawal of his status as
political refugee," Chaika said.


In an interview with the Guardian newspaper on Friday, Berezovsky
called for a revolution against the regime of Russian President
Vladimir Putin, although he later said he did not advocate
violence.


"Elections are not a viable means of ensuring democratic change
in Russia. Therefore I do support using other methods to push for
a change back towards democracy," Berezovsky said in the
interview.


The British government -- whose relations with Russia were
seriously strained by former spy Alexander Litvinenko's murder in
London last year -- immediately denounced the remarks.


Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday called on
Britain to take "relevant measures" against the businessman.
