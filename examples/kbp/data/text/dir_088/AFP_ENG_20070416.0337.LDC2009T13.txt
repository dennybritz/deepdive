The price of wheat held close to a three-year high here on
Monday, owing to forecasts of falling supplies amid freezing
weather in key exporter the United States, analysts said.


On the LIFFE, London's futures exchange, the price per tonne of
wheat for May delivery soared as high as 101 pounds on Monday.


The contract had closed at 100 pounds on Friday, which marked the
highest finish since April 2004.


"Global supplies generally are pretty tight this year," said Amy
Reynolds, analyst at the London-based International Grains
Council (IGC).


She added: "What we have also seen in the last couple of weeks
(is) rather unfavourable weather in the United States. We have
had some very cold temperatures which analysts believe have
probably damaged the crop.


"What was looking like a fairly large harvest in the United
States might not happen, which will make the supply and demand
situation for the next marketing year (2007/2008) rather tight."


The IGC estimates that world wheat production would amount to 590
million tonnes in the 2006-07 cycle, which was 5.0 percent less
than the previous harvest.


Demand will outstrip supply by about 17 million tonnes in the
current harvest year, according to IGC data.


Elsewhere, on the Chicago Board of Trade on Monday, the price of
wheat for May delivery rose to 4.85 US dollars per bushel, from
4.55 dollars last Friday.


Traders were keenly awaiting Monday's weekly crops progress
report from the United States Department of Agriculture. The
release was expected to show the extent of recent crop damage.
