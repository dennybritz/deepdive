Spain's economy posted its best performance last year since the
country returned to democracy following the death of right-wing
dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975, Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said Monday.


Zapatero, who faces local elections next month and a general
election next year, said the economy will grow by over 3.5
percent this year after expanding 3.9 percent in 2006, making it
one of Europe's strongest economies that year.


Gross domestic product expanded by 4.0 percent alone in the first
quarter of 2007, he said in an address to the Spanish stock
exchange.


"The merit which this positive economic scenario draws on is the
maturity which Spanish society has achieved," the socialist prime
minister said.


The government had previously estimated that Spain's gross
domestic product (GDP) would expand by 3.4 percent this year.


The national statistics institute is scheduled to publish its
first quarter GDP growth figures on May 23.


Zapatero said the Spanish economy -- which is in its 14th year of
uninterrupted growth -- was enjoying a "virtuous circle" of lower
consumer prices, reduced public deficits and gradually improving
productivity.


The Spanish prime minister identified Spain's growing current
account deficit as one of the nation's biggest economic
challenges.


The deficit hit 8.62 billion euros (11.68 billion US dollars) in
January, up from 6.28 billion euros in the same month in 2006,
Spain's central bank said Monday.
