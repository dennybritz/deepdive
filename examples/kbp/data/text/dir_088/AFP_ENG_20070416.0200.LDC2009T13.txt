French intelligence services warned their US counterparts, eight
months before the attacks of September 11, 2001, that Al-Qaeda
was planning to hijack a US- bound plane, a media report said
Monday.


The information that Osama bin Laden's group, working with
Taliban militants and Chechen rebels, had been plotting the move
was passed on to Bill Murray, head of the Central Intelligence
Agency's Paris bureau, Le Monde daily said.


The paper published a copy of the first page of a five-page
document which it said had been handed over to the CIA in January
2001 by the French foreign intelligence agency, the DGSE.


The DGSE declined to comment when contacted by AFP.


Le Monde said the document, titled "Aircaft hijack plan by
radical Islamists," was part of 328 pages of a DGSE file on Al-
Qaeda leaked to the paper which it said was practically the
entirety of the French intelligence services' dossier on the
network.


AFP was able to consult the five-page document which said the
plotters began working on the plan in 2000.


Their plan was to hijack a plane flying from the German city of
Frankfurt, where there was an Al-Qaeda cell, towards an American
airport.


The DGSE document said the plotters considered seven airlines,
two of which -- American and United Airlines -- had planes
hijacked in the September 2001 attacks and flown into buildings
in US cities.
