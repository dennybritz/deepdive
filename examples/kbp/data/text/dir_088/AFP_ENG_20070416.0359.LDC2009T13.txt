UEFA president Michel Platini will attend the German football
federation (DFB) general assembly in October in a bid to improve
relations with the powerful body, which opposed his candidacy,
Germany's top official said on Monday.


"We are happy about this positive response and see here the proof
of some good work between UEFA and the DFB, and their two
presidents," DFB president Theo Zwanziger said after a meeting
with Platini at the headquarters of the European governing body.


Platini said after two hours of talks: "We will not concern
ourselves with things that happened in the past.


"The important thing is that the DFB plays a meaningful role in
all decisions in the future."


Zwanziger was a vocal supporter of Platini's rival for the UEFA
presidency, the 78-year-old incumbent Lennart Johansson.


When Platini won in the first round of voting on January 26,
Zwanziger said the Frenchman owed his success to the votes of
"countries with no more than a hundred inhabitants".


The DFB meeting will take place in Mainz on October 26.
