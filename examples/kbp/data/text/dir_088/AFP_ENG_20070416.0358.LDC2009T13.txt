Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on Monday threatened
to launch impeachment proceedings against arch-rival President
Viktor Yushchenko, the Interfax news agency reported.


Asked whether he was ready to launch impeachment proceedings if
the country's constitutional court decides Yushchenko's decree to
dissolve parliament is legitimate, Yanukovych said "yes".


Yanukovych does not currently control the necessary votes in
parliament to instigate the procedure, however.


Ukraine has been gripped by street protests and political
paralysis since Yushchenko announced on April 2 that he was
dissolving parliament and calling early elections.
