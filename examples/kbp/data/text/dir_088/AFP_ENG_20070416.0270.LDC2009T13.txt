Laurent Seigne was sacked as coach of Castres on Monday, the
French Top 14 club said.


Seigne had been in charge of the team, who sit 10th in the
14-team French top division, since the beginning of the 2005/06
season, but he failed to qualify his team for the Top 14 semi-
finals or the European Cup in his two seasons in charge.
