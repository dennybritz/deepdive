A US university in Virginia said Monday a shooting on its campus
had left multiple victims, urging students to stay behind closed
doors in a website announcement.


There has been "a multiple shooting with multiple victims," said
Virginia Tech, adding one gunman had already been arrested and
police were searching for a possible second shooter.


Gunfire first broke out earlier Monday in a residence of the
campus based in the small US town of Blacksburg, and was then
heard in a second building, called the Norris Hall.


"Those on campus are asked to remain where they are, lock their
doors and stay away from windows," said the campus, which has
some 25,000 students, as it cancelled all classes for the rest of
the day.


"Police have one shooter in custody and as part of routine police
procedure, they continue to search for a second shooter.


"All people in university buildings are required to stay inside
until further notice," added the university, located some 425
kilometers (264 miles) southwest of Washington.
