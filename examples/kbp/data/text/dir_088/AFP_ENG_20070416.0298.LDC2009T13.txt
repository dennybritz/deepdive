Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"We are here not to fight against an established sport. I admire
the game called cricket and I don't want to change the most
established sport in your country now. But I always campaign for
football because in this game there is no difference between
caste, culture and creed, or rich and poor. It is the fascination
of this game that attracts people all over the world."


- FIFA president Sepp Blatter on a visit to India


"People said we shouldn't be in the Super Eights but it gave us
more motivation. We took those comments on board and it was like
a mini World Cup for us against Bangladesh."


- Ireland skipper Trent Johnston after his team defeated
Bangladesh by 74 runs.


"We were very ordinary today and we deserved to be beaten."


- Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar after Sunday's loss.


"I think everyone knows we don't get on for whatever reasons, but
that's gone. It's not about myself, Smith, Andre Nel or Michael
Vaughan on Tuesday, it's about producing a big team performance."


- England's South African-born batsman Kevin Pietersen on his
feud with Proteas skipper Graeme Smith.


"I've got some good friends in the opposition side who I've
played with and won a World Cup with. But that doesn't mean my
focus and preparation is any different for the Sri Lankan team
against Australia than it would be against any other team. I'm
focused on winning the match."


- Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody on facing his Australian countrymen
at the World Cup.
