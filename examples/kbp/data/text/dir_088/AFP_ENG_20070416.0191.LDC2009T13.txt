A gang of machinegun-wielding thieves robbed a major shopping
mall jewellery store in a rare attack in the relatively safe Gulf
emirate of Dubai, the local press reported on Monday.


An unidentified number of robbers used a car to ram through one
of the main glass gates of Wafi City mall, then drove down the
wide aisles of the shopping centre to the jewellery shop on
Sunday night, Al-Emarat Al-Yom said.


A second getaway car followed and helped the thieves escape after
they ransacked the store within the space of two minutes, it
added.


"The operation was well plotted by a specialised gang," the daily
quoted Dubai police as saying.


The robbers fired several gunshots, shattering the shop windows,
the English daily 7Days quoted witnesses as saying after what
appeared to be the first attack of its kind in the United Arab
Emirates in recent years.


The two cars were later found abandoned near the mall, and the
raiders were still at large having stolen a large amount of
jewellery, the newspapers added.


No casualties were reported.
