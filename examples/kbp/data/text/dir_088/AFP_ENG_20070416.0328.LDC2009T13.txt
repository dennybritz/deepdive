A Bosnian court on Monday sentenced a former Serb soldier to five
and a half years' jail for the wartime rape of a Muslim woman.


The Bosnian war crimes court found Radmilo Vukovic, 54, guilty of
repeatedly raping and physically abusing the unidentified Muslim
woman in the eastern town of Miljevina during the country's
1992-1995 conflict.


"The forcible sexual intercourse caused the victim to fall
pregnant, resulting in the birth of a child after which the
victim was expelled" from the then Serb- controlled area, said
the court.


At the beginning of the war that ultimately claimed up to 200,000
lives, Serb forces captured eastern swathes of Bosnia and
expelled or killed non-Serbs as part of their notorious campaign
of "ethnic cleansing".


Serb soldiers set up numerous brothels in the area, subjecting
hundreds of Muslim women and girls to sexual abuse and inhumane
treatment.


The Court of Bosnia-Hercegovina's war crimes chamber was set up
in 2005. It deals with lesser crimes referred to the country by
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
(ICTY), which is based in The Hague.
