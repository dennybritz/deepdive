The opening day of the Louis Vuitton Cup, due to start here
Monday, has been cancelled due to light winds, organisers
announced.


The 10-race programme was scheduled to begin at 1420 (1220GMT)
but after several delays conditions failed to improve and the
day's action was called off just before 1700 (1500GMT).


Monday's races in this two-month long competition, which will
determine the challenger to America's Cup defender Alinghi,
featured Team New Zealand up against Italy's Mascalzone Latino-
Capitalia Team.


The opening day's match races will now be held on Tuesday,
weather permitting.
