An earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale on Monday shook
southern and central Albania, including the capital, the
country's meteorological agency said.


There were no reports of casualties or major damage.


The epicentre of the earthquake, which occurred at 9:38 am (0738
GMT), was localised in Elbasan, some 67 kilometers (40 miles)
south of Tirana, the agency said.


While there were no reports of casualties or major damage, panic
broke out in the capital following a local television report
warning of possible after quakes throughout the day.


The Meteorological Agency denied the report, but a number of
Tirana citizens decided nonetheless to go out into the streets in
anticipation of more quakes.
