An earthquake struck in the Ionian Sea off the western Greek
coast early Monday, while another tremor was recorded in central
and southern Albania.


Neither of the quakes which occurred several hours apart caused
casualties or major damage.


Measuring 4.3 on the Richter scale, the first was recorded at
7:40 am (0440 GMT) in the Ionian Sea, off the western coast of
the Peloponnese, Athens Observatory's Geodynamic Institute said.


It described the quake as weak, saying it occurred in the sea,
220 kilometres (135 miles) west of Athens near the town of
Amaliada.


Western Greece has since March 25 felt tremors of a magnitude of
up to 5.9 on the Richter scale, which have caused limited damage.


An earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale also shook
central and southern Albania Monday, the Meteorological Agency
said.


Occurring at 9:38 am (0738 GMT), its epicentre was in Elbasan,
some 67 kilometres (40 miles) south of Tirana, the agency said.


It was also felt in the capital Tirana but there were no reports
of casualties or major damage.


However, information about possible new quakes during the day
broadcast by a local television channel caused a huge panic among
residents of the capital.


The country's meteorological agency denied the report, but a
number of Tirana citizens decided nonetheless to go out into the
streets in anticipation of more quakes.
