British teenager Andy Murray broke into the world's top ten for
the first time when the new ATP rankings were released on Monday.


The 19-year-old swapped places with German Tommy Haas, who drops
to 11th, as he becomes the second teenager behind Serbia's Novak
Djokovic in the top 10.


Murray did not play last week but benefitted from Haas's
elimination in the quarter-finals in Houston, meaning he dropped
points.


That was the only change in the top 20.
