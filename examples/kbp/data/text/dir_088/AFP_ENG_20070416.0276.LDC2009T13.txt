Japanese firm TOTO, the world's top toilet maker, said Monday it
will provide free repairs on 180,000 electric bidet toilets after
a defect in their heater caused three units to catch fire.


Defective plating has also caused 26 other units to send up smoke
from a part of the heating equipment placed below the water tank
of TOTO's "Washlet Z" series toilets, TOTO Ltd. said in a
statement.


The 180,000 units were manufactured between March 1999 and
December 2001 and the three fire incidents occurred in the year
to March 2007, the statement said. The TOTO Washlet jets water at
the push of a button on the seat, or via a remote control. It has
different models with different features including air
fresheners, seat heaters and dryers.
