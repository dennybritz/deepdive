The head of a Malawian orphanage refuted reports Monday that
Madonna was to adopt a young girl from her children's home as the
US pop diva flew into the southeast African country.


British newspaper The Sun reported that the London-based singer
wanted to adopt a three-year-old girl called Grace from the
Consol Home as a sister to one-year- old David whom she was given
custody of last year.


However Yacinta Chapomba, founder of the Consol Home near the
capital Lilongwe, flatly denied the possibility that Madonna
would adopt a second child from Malawi from her orphanage.


"We have no Grace here. We don't know how the rumour started, but
our daycare centres don't encourage adoption. We never allow any
of our children to be adopted," she told AFP.


"Probably the rumour started about Grace because of our
partnership with Madonna after she funded the construction of
this centre."


Madonna's spokeswoman has also denied that the singer is planning
to adopt another child.


"Madonna is going to Africa to continue her work with the Raising
Malawi organisation," the star's spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg said.


"She is overseeing the building of a children's healthcare
centre. She is absolutely not adopting another baby."


Madonna's Malawian attorney Alan Chinula said he was not in the
loop about any plans to adopt a Malawian girl.


"I have not been given any instructions. I don't know anything."


The singer arrived in Malawi on Monday morning with David and was
whisked away to an exclusive lodge where she will be staying.


Consol Home, in Maphundla around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from
the capital Lilongwe, looks after more than 8,000 orphans in
scores of villages in the area.


Madonna's son David was expected to be meeting with his
biological father during the three-day visit.
