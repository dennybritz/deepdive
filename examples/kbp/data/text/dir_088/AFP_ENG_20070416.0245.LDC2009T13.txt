US and Indonesian scientists have joined forces in a bid to halt
the high number of bird flu deaths in the archipelago nation, a
US official said Monday.


US deputy undersecretary of agriculture Charles Lambert said the
group would focus on stemming the spread of the virus in
Indonesia's poultry industry.


Lambert opened an office Monday for the team, which consists of
four local scientists and one from the US, plus support staff.


The group will conduct workshops for Indonesian health and animal
husbandry officials and veterinarians to detect the virus and
prevent its spread.


"Our primary role is working on bird health. Our focus is to
improve the poultry industry in order to reduce the potential of
human-to-human infection," said Max Coats, a veterinarian who
will head the office in Jakarta.


"If we can work well on the bird side, we hope you will face less
(deaths) on the human side," he told reporters.


Seventy four people have died in Indonesia from bird flu since
June 2005 out of 94 confirmed infections.


Most cases have occurred after contact with sick birds. But
scientists fear the deadly H5N1 strain could mutate and become
easily transmissible among people, triggering a devastating human
pandemic.


The Indonesian government had hoped to eradicate bird flu deaths
in 2007. It has banned the popular practice of keeping poultry in
backyards in Jakarta to try and check the disease's spread.


The US government has committed about 24 million dollars to
combat bird flu in Indonesia since July 2005, the US embassy here
said in a statement.
