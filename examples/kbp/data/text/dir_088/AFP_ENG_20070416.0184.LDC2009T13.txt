Reality TV giant Endemol, creator of the global hit "Big
Brother", announced Monday it was teaming up with interactive
gaming leader Electronic Arts to launch a virtual world for
television addicts.


"Virtual Me" was announced at the opening of the five-day
MIPTV/MILIA trade show, one of the world's largest broadcasting
and audiovisual trade events.


The concept was "an extraordinary leap forward in online digital
entertainment," Peter Bazalgette, chief creative officer of the
Netherlands-based Endemol, told reporters.


"This will marry the interactivity of video with the mass market
appeal of TV entertainment," he added.


The project, to be launched this summer, would allow TV and
gaming fans to create the most sophisticated cyber-clones, or
avatars, yet in existence, said Bazalgette.


Users would be able "to become a star in the virtual world and
even take part in their favourite TV shows like 'Big Brother'",
Bazalgette said. Endemol's other hits include "Deal or No Deal"
and "Fear Factor".


Downloading will be free but the companies plan to raise revenue
through the venture, though they declined to give details on
strategy.


Electronic Arts is a US developer, publisher and distributor of
computer and video games initially set up in 1982.


Currently its most successful products are sports games published
under the EA Sports label, games based on popular movie licences
such as James Bond and long- running franchises such as Need for
Speed, Medal of Honor, The Sims, Command & Conquer.
