Police on Monday said they had arrested two people, seized
hundreds of illegally obtained antique coins and jewels and
demolished a workshop producing forgeries.


The two people, a 48-year-old jeweler and his 50-year-old
supplier, were arrested in the centre of the capital after police
were tipped off to their activities.


Officers seized 54 antique coins in gold, 162 in silver and 370
in bronze, as well as about a dozen gold and silver bracelets,
two bronze rings, three medallions, and 90 Pre-Columbian terra
cotta statues.


All the objects had been obtained illegally.


Police also discovered a forgery workshop where they seized 3000
fake antique coins, seven bronze statues, moulds and various
copies of objects from Cycladic times (3200 to 2000 BC).
