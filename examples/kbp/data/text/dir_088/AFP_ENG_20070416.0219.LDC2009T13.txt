Cypriot police Monday launched a manhunt after the body of a
Russian woman was found bound and gagged on a bed while a female
compatriot was also attacked but survived the ordeal.


Police discovered the body before dawn Monday after being called
to an apartment block in the centre of Nicosia.


Investigators said they found the 20-year-old Russian woman lying
dead in her pyjamas in a ground floor flat while her 31-year-old
flatmate was badly injured and taken to hospital.


State pathologist Nicos Charalambous told reporters the victim
was fully clothed but that her hands, feet and mouth were bound
with tape.


"There were signs of a struggle in the flat and the young victim
was found on her bed," Charalambous told reporters after a
forensic examination of the scene.


According to state radio, the two women arrived on the island
earlier this month.
