British producer prices, or the cost of goods at the factory
gate, rose more strongly than expected in March, official data
showed Monday, helping to push sterling to a 14-year point high
against the dollar.


Producers' wholesale prices climbed by 0.6 percent in March from
the previous month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said
in a release.


It said the monthly increase -- the highest since April 2005 --
reflected mainly rises in the cost of raw materials, such as
petroleum products.


On a 12-month basis, producer prices rose by 2.7 percent in
March.


The readings were ahead of analysts' consensus forecasts for a
0.3-percent monthly gain, and for an annual figure of 2.2
percent.


The data sent sterling closer to 2.0 dollars, as the foreign
exchange market bet that the figures would increase the
likelihood of a rate hike by the Bank of England in May, dealers
said.


Sterling climbed to 1.9940 dollars in European trade -- the
highest level since September 1992.


Meanwhile input costs, or the cost of raw materials to industry,
rose by 1.2 percent in March from February.


Input prices gained by 0.7 percent year-on-year, the ONS added.
