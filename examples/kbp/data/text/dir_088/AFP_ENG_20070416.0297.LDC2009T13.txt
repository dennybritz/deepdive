Hundreds of villagers in Indian Kashmir poured onto the streets
Monday chanting anti-police slogans to protest the death of two
Muslim men in a weekend shoot- out, a witness said.


Police said the two were killed by suspected militants Sunday
during fighting between rebels and a security patrol in Kashmir's
southern Pulwama district.


However, local residents blamed the police and launched a protest
that shut down traffic on a main road, a witness said.


Villagers agreed to call off the protest after authorities
ordered an investigation.


"An official probe has been ordered into the incident and those
involved in the killings will be dealt as per the law," deputy
commissioner of Pulwama, Mehraj Ahmed Kakroo, told reporters.


Indian police are already investigating five cases that came to
light in early 2007 in which innocent civilians were allegedly
killed and passed off as militants.


Police have charged 17 members of the security forces with murder
in two of the cases.


In a separate incident Monday, a policeman was killed when
suspected militants opened fire on a group of engineers
inspecting the construction of a railway line in Pulwama, police
said.


India is building a rail link from Jammu, Kashmir's winter
capital, with the northern Muslim-dominated Kashmir valley. A
part of the line is scheduled to be opened by mid-year.


Kashmir is in the grip of a 17-year insurgency that has left more
than 42,000 people dead by official count, with as many as 3,000
disappeared.


Human rights groups put the death toll at 70,000 and say the
number of disappeared is closer to 10,000.
