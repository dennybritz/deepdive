A man who fired shots at the US embassy in the Yemeni capital did
so because he loathed American policies in Iraq and Afghanistan,
a court in Sanaa heard at the start of his trial on Monday.


The motives which drove Saleh Alawi al-Amari, 19, to fire at the
embassy last December 5 included his "resentment of US policies
in Iraq and Afghanistan" and of Washington's "support for the
Israelis in Lebanon and Palestine," according to the prosecutor,
citing the defendant's confession.


Amari, who used to listen to "jihadi tape recordings, believed
that death (in an attack against) the US embassy would amount to
martyrdom and jihad" or holy war, Khaled al-Mawri said.


He called for the maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison for
the accused, who did not answer the judge's questions. The trial
was adjourned until April 30 after the court appointed a defence
lawyer.


Amari fired at the embassy using an automatic weapon before being
shot and overpowered by police.


Since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Yemen
has worked with Washington in its so-called "war on terror" to
clamp down on suspected Al-Qaeda members.


Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the world, is the
ancestral homeland of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.


In October 2000, 17 US sailors were killed when suicide bombers
attacked the destroyer USS Cole off the southern Yemeni port of
Aden in an attack claimed by the network.
