The German defence ministry said Monday it was considering
disciplinary action against an army instructor who ordered a
recruit to shout insults and shoot at imaginary African-
Americans.


"It is completely unacceptable," defence ministry spokesman
Thomas Raabe told a press conference.


"We are examining whether disciplinary measures can be brought."


The video, which has been shown on German television, was shot in
July 2006 in a forest near an army barracks in the northern town
of Rendsburg.


It shows the instructor first telling recruits to imagine they
were fighting plane hijackers. At the end of the exercise he
congratulates them, saying "That's good, the terrorists are
dead."


He then tells them: "Now you're in the Bronx. A black truck stops
in front of you. Three African-Americans get out and insult your
mother grossly. Every time before you pull the trigger I want to
hear you shout 'motherfucker' very loudly."


The junior soldier is then shown executing the order, shouting
the required word before each shot, encouraged by his superior.


The German army has been dogged by scandals in recent months.


Eighteen army instructors are currently on trial accused of
mistreating recruits during training in 2004.


Last year, German soldiers serving in Afghanistan were
photographed posing with skulls. An inquiry involving 20 soldiers
was launched, and six have already been suspended from duty.
