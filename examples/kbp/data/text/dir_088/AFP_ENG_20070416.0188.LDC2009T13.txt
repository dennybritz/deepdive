Rail traffic in Belgium was in chaos Monday amid a strike by
ticket collectors over safety conditions after four of their
colleagues were attacked at work at the weekend.


At least one in every two trains was cancelled in the French-
speaking Wallonia region in Belgium's south, and conditions were
only slightly better in Flanders to the north, union
representatives said.


The strike also hit road traffic, with long tailbacks reported
around cities Monday morning, at the start of the first working
week after the Easter holiday.


The ticket collectors, who started their strike at 3:30 am (0130
GMT), are demanding that they be allowed to work in pairs on rail
services they consider most dangerous.


The stoppage comes after a wildcat strike by firefighters and
security staff closed down Brussels airport on Friday.
