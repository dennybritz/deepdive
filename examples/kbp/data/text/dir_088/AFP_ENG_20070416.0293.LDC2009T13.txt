Small shareholders in Telecom Italia were up in arms Monday over
the prospect of US giant AT&T and its Mexican affiliate
America Movil buying a stake in the group.


"I appeal for dignity to the leaders of Telecom: resign, sirs!"
said Italian humourist Bepe Grillo, himself a shareholder, at a
heated general assembly meeting attended by hundreds of
shareholders in the northern town of Rozzano, near Milan.


The formal purpose of the meeting was to renew Telecom Italia's
board of directors.


Grillo slammed former Telecom Italia chairman Marco Tronchetti
Provera for maintaining control of the company through a series
of holding companies.


Tronchetti Provera is chairman of tyre company Pirelli, which in
turn holds 80 percent of the Olimpia holding company, which has
the largest stake in Telecom Italia, but one that amounts to just
18 percent.


Grillo also criticised the operator's investment policy, the sale
of the group's buildings and revelations of an illegal phone-
tapping unit involving Telecom Italia officials who now face
trial.


Elio Lannutti, the head of the financial services consumer
association ADUSBEF, denounced Pirelli's exclusive negotiations
with AT&T and America Movil.


The two North American companies "can buy one of the country's
biggest companies for peanuts, with no profit for small
shareholders," he said.


The general assembly was set to last a dozen hours with speeches
planned by many small shareholders.
