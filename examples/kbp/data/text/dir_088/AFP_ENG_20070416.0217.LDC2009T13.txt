Croatian prosecutors on Monday indicted a former deputy and six
others for killing Serb civilians in the eastern town of Osijek
during the country's independence war.


Branimir Glavas was charged with ordering the 1991 abductions,
torture and murder of 10 Serbs who were killed by a special unit
formed by co-accused Ivica Krnjak and Gordana Getos Magdic, said
the indictment.


Glavas, 50, was the defence chief of Osijek at the time of the
atrocities allegedly committed when the town had been surrounded
by the Yugoslav army and rebel Serb forces.


At least 37 Serb civilians were killed in the town at the end of
1991 and the beginning of 1992, according to police figures.


Glavas is the most senior political figure to have faced legal
action for war crimes in Croatia.


He had been released from custody in December after his health
deteriorated due to a hunger strike but prosecutors are seeking
to have him detained again ahead of a trial.


Croatia's proclamation of independence from the former Yugoslavia
in 1991 sparked a four-year war with Belgrade-backed rebel Serbs
who opposed the move.
