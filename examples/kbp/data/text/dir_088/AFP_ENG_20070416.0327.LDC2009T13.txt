A 15,000-year-old skeleton of a Siberian mammoth went under the
hammer Monday for a mammoth 260,000 euros (352,000 dollars) at a
rare paleontology sale by Christie's auction house.


The name of the buyer was not made public.


The skeleton, which with its tusks stands 3.8 metres (12.5 feet)
high and measures over 4.8 metres in length, had been estimated
at between 150,000 euros (199,400 dollars) and 180,000 euros.


The "mammuthus primigenius" dating back to the Quaternary period,
or later Pleistocene, was put on sale by an unnamed "private
European collector."


Also sold Monday was the skeleton of a woolly rhinoceros some
10,000 years old that went for 100,000 euros (135,000 dollars),
well above its estimated price of 65,000 euros.
