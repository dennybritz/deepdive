A Guinean military fighter plane crashed on Monday into a suburb
of the capital of the west African country, witnesses said.


Three pilots aboard the plane escaped, the Interior Minister
Mamadou Beau Keita said.


"There has been no victim, the three MiG 21 pilots were thrown
out," Keita told AFP.


Witnesses said the MiG 21 burst into flames when it came down on
part of the building which houses the country's state radio and
television station (RTG), and in front of the US embassy in the
Ratoma suburb.


The army regularly undertakes training exercises around the
capital.
