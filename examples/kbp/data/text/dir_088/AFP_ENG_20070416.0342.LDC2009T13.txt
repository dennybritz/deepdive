A senior officer serving with the US Navy's Fifth Fleet in the
Gulf was relieved of his command on Monday due to a "loss of
confidence" in his abilities, the US navy said.


Commander Christopher Rankin, who headed the Electronic Attack
Squadron aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier,
was relieved of command by Captain Scott Stearney due to a "loss
of confidence in his ability to command," the statement said.


"Rankin has been temporarily assigned to Commander, Carrier
Strike Group 8 pending further review of the matter," the
statement added.


A US Navy spokesperson told AFP that an investigation was
underway but declined to give further details.


The fleet is based on the strategically important island of
Bahrain and played a key role in the US-led invasion of Iraq in
2003.
