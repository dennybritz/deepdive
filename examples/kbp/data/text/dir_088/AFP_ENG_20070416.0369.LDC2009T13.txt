Shanghai on Monday finalised an agreement making it the first
Asian city to host an ATP Masters Series event, state media said.


ATP chief executive Brad Drewett signed the agreement with
Shanghai Administration of Sports director Yu Chen, Xinhua news
agency said.


Officials described the permanent deal as a boost for China's
biggest city, which will lose the season-ending Masters Cup
tournament after 2008.


"Shanghai finally makes its dream come true," said Qiu Weichang,
the Shanghai sports body's deputy director.


The nine annual Masters Series tournaments are a step above the
regular ATP events with an elite 32-man field.


The WTA has separately announced that Beijing will host one of
four elite events as part of a streamlined women's tour.


China, not a traditional power in tennis, is emerging as a force
in the women's game thanks to rising stars such as Li Na and
Zheng Jie.
