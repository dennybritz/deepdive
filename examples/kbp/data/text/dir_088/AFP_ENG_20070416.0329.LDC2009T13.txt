Argentine football idol Diego Maradona remains hospitalized in
"stable" condition, after a relapse of the chronic hepatitis he
has suffered for years, his doctor said in a newspaper report
Monday.


Doctor Alfredo Cahe told the "La Nacion" newspaper in an
interview Sunday that the famous footballer was likely to remain
hospitalized for the foreseeable future.


"Even if he were to get better today, he should remain
hospitalized," Cahe told the daily.


Maradona, 46, was rushed to the Los Arcos clinic in Buenos Aires
Friday complaining of severe abdominal pain, just two days after
being discharged from a different facility after nearly two
weeks' treatment for excessive drinking.


The former captain of Argentina's winning World Cup side and star
for Barcelona and Napoli has seen his career on and off the
football field marred by repeated drug and alcohol abuse.


He has suffered from hepatitis B since 1991, when he played for
Barcelona.


He was hospitalized in 2000 and 2004 for heart attacks provoked
by cocaine overdoses.
