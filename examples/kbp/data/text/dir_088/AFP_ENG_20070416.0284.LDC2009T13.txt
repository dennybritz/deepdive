The United States said Monday that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-
Maliki could keep his beleaguered coalition government together,
after radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr withdrew his six ministers.


"Coalitions in those types of parliamentary democracies can come
and go," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said as Sadr, a
Shiite hardliner, pushed his demand for a rapid withdrawal of US
troops.


"If the Sadrists were to leave the government -- obviously
they've said they would before and I understand that they have
done that this morning -- that does not mean that Maliki loses
his majority. I think that's an important thing to remember,"
Perino told reporters.


Sadr -- who has not been seen in public since October -- was
angered last week when street protests failed to persuade Maliki
to set a timeline for American forces to go home.


Sadr's bloc is the largest single political group in Maliki's
fragmenting coalition, but the prime minister will be able to
cling to power if he keeps the support of smaller Shiite and
Kurdish groups.
