Insurgent gunmen attacked an Iraqi army checkpoint on a road in
northern Iraq on Monday and killed 13 soldiers, army Major Qassim
Abdullah said.


"A large group of terrorists drove up in five cars and opened
fire immediately on the Al-Hadhar checkpoint, before making off,"
the commander told AFP in the northern city of Mosul.


Four soldiers were wounded in the attack, Abdullah added.


Hadhar is a remote town on a major road south of Mosul, 300
kilometres (185 miles) north of Baghdad in an area where Iraqi
security forces often clash with Sunni insurgents linked to the
Al-Qaeda network.
