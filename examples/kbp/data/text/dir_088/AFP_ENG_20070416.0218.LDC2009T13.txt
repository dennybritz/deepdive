Sri Lanka wants compensation from cricket's world governing body
for a cancelled tri-series last year that it says caused a loss
of 12 million dollars, a top official here said Monday.


The series involving India, South Africa and the hosts was
cancelled in Colombo in August when the Proteas abandoned the
tour and flew home after a roadside bombing here.


"We plan to write to the ICC (International Cricket Council)
seeking compensation under a tournament cancellation scheme," Sri
Lanka Cricket (SLC) secretary K. Mathivanan told AFP.


"We lost millions after the tournament was abandoned. Hopefully
ICC will give us some money to cover our costs," Mathivanan said
without specifying the amount sought from the ICC.


The SLC had also moved a local court to seek compensation from
the Ceylinco Insurance Company on its "sports cancellation and
abandonment policy" worth 11.9 million dollars.


The insurance company denied the cricket board's claim, arguing
that the matches were called off due to bad weather and not
terrorism as specified in the terms of the insurance policy.


The South Africans, who had earlier played two Test matches in
Colombo, left Sri Lanka after suspected Tamil Tiger rebels set
off a Claymore mine targeting the convoy of Pakistan's Ambassador
Bashir Ali Mohamund on August 14.


The envoy escaped unhurt, but four of his guards were killed and
10 vehicles were damaged in the blast which occurred close to the
hotel in downtown Colombo where the South Africans were staying.
