British producer prices, or the cost of goods at the factory
gate, rose by 0.6 percent in March from the previous month,
official data showed Monday.


On a 12-month basis, producer prices rose by 2.7 percent in
March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a
release.


The readings were ahead of analysts' consensus forecasts for a
0.3-percent monthly gain, and for an annual figure of 2.2
percent.
