Several outbreaks of violence marred football matches in Greece
at the weekend, following a two-week suspension of team sports
after a deadly hooligan clash, press reports said Monday.


The worst incidents occurred during Sunday's third division match
in the western town of Agrinio where a fight left three people,
including two players, in hospital and play had to be halted for
30 minutes.


In another incident, about 50 supporters in Kalamata, in the
southern Peloponnese peninsula, attacked their team's Brazilian
coach and his assistant after the team's defeat.


Other incidents were also reported in Larissa, Salonika and
Athens during second division matches.


Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras has warned against panic
and opened an inquiry into whether the police presence at Agrinio
had been sufficient.


"Unbelievable", "The Monster of Violence is Back", "Violence has
Won" commented the country's national daily newspapers Monday.


The Greek government decided on a series of measures and
announced legislation against violence after the death of a 25
-year-old fan in a pitched hooligan battle ahead of a women's
volleyball match outside Athens at the end of last month.


It also suspended all team sport matches until April 13 as a
result of the fan's death.
