The government of Liberia plans to set up a rapid reaction force
to quell any riots when UN peacekeeping troops pull out, the
information minister said Monday.


"This unit will assume duty upon the departure of the United
Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL)," Lawrence Bropleh said in a
statement.


The Quick Reaction Force, to include members of the UN-trained
national police force, will also police street demonstrations and
undertake general day and nighttime city patrols.


In the past, special crack units in Liberia have been accused of
alleged human rights violations but Bropleh moved to allay any
fears.


"The formation of the unit within the police should not scare the
public because it would be composed of well-trained and
professional officers who will demonstrate respect for the rule
of law and human rights," he said.


UNMIL, which fields nearly 17,000 peacekeepers in the tiny west
African country, has been responsible for security in Liberia
since a brutal 14-year civil war which killed around 270,000
people, ended there in 2003.


Extending UNMIL's mandate by another six months on March 30, the
UN Security Council called on the Liberian government to start
preparing for a phased withdrawal of UN troops "as the situation
permits and without compromising the security" of the war-scarred
country.
