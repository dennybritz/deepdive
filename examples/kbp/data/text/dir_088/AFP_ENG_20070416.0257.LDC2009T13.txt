The European Commission voiced concern on Monday over a
favouritism scandal surrounding World Bank president Paul
Wolfowitz, and expressed the hope that it would not affect
cooperation.


"We hope this will be dealt with in a proper way. We hope that
this will not affect our cooperation, which is increasing and
which is crucial" for developing countries especially in Africa,
said Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, spokesman for EU Humanitarian Aid
Commissioner Louis Michel.


"We are concerned about the institution, we are concerned about
these allegations of course, and we are monitoring this," he told
reporters in Brussels.


On Sunday, Wolfowitz refused to resign as the development
lender's member governments revealed their "great concern" over
huge pay increases and guaranteed promotions he secured for his
girlfriend Shaha Riza at the bank.


The Commission spokesman said that Michel had just returned from
meetings with Wolfowitz in Washington and that "we are in fact
increasing our cooperation" with the World Bank with a view to
providing aid more efficiently.


"I think this is an issue for the member of the board of the
bank," he told reporters, adding that the EU has only observer
status.


The 185-member bank's ministerial policymakers remained split on
Wolfowitz's fate, with the former Pentagon deputy chief
continuing to enjoy strong backing from the US administration.
