Radical Hindus stormed the headquarters of an Indian television
network Monday and damaged equipment to protest the broadcast of
reports on a controversial Hindu-Muslim marriage, witnesses said.


Activists from a group calling itself the Hindu Rashtriya Sena
(Hindu National Army) used hammers to smash windows, computers
and cameras at the Star News office in India's commercial hub
before police intervened.


"They threatened journalists and smashed our studios and cars and
warned that an even larger group of activists will return to
teach us a lesson if we highlight inter-religion marriages," a
spokesman for the channel said.


Police said arrests had been made. "We arrested 17 of them on the
spot and we are taking legal action," Mumbai Police Commissioner
J.N. Jadhav told reporters.


The Muslim woman and her Hindu husband presented themselves to
the channel last week saying they faced threats because of their
marriage, and have appeared on several Star News programmes.


Star News is a division of Rupert Murdoch's Hong Kong-based Star
group.
