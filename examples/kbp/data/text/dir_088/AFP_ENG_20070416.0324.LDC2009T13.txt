Thousands of rabbits had Hungarian police and firefighters on the
hop early Monday when they escaped on to a key motorway following
an accident.


Hundreds of the bunnies were killed before the majority of the
5,000 rabbits could be rounded up by police.


"Around 400 rabbits were killed in the accident...It took about
six hours to collect the rest," Budapest Police spokeswoman
Viktoria Galik told AFP, adding that there were no human
injuries. Around 100 escaped, she said.


The rabbits went on the loose around the M1 highway linking the
capital Budapest to the Austrian border after an accident
involving the truck transporting them.


Traffic had to be diverted to secondary roads until the surviving
rabbits were collected.
