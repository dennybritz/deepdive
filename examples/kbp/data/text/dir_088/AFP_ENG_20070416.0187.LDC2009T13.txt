Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol said on Monday that Khartoum
had fully accepted the second phase of a UN plan to bolster a
peacekeeping operation in Darfur, including the deployment of
helicopter gunships.


"Sudan has accepted the second phase of the agreement of UN
support to the African force," Akol told a news conference.


He said "yes" when asked if this included the deployment of
helicopter gunships -- an issue over which Sudan had previously
expressed reservations.
