The husband of Philippines President Gloria Arroyo came off the
respirator Monday for the first time after major heart surgery
and chatted briefly with his wife from his hospital bed, the
president said.


The president told reporters said her husband Jose Miguel, 60,
was now "much better" and she talked to him for about 15 minutes.


He had heart surgery early last week to repair a leak in the main
heart artery and a triple bypass on another artery.


The president has revised a planned five-day visit to China this
week and will now stay only Friday before returning to her
husband's bedside.


"It will be now cut down to April 20-21 and only in Boao," she
said, referring to a resort on Hainan island.


The president was to have visited five cities during her trip but
she will now fly straight to Hainan where she hopes to sign a
number of agreements.


Arroyo said she was expected to attract investment pledges of
about two billion dollars, but did not elaborate.
