Team New Zealand, out to avenge the humbling 5-0 capitulation of
their America's Cup crown to Alinghi four years ago, and the
other 10 challengers to the Swiss team's crown were left
frustrated by the elements on the opening day of the Louis
Vuitton Cup here Monday.


The 10-race programmme in this America's Cup qualifying
competition was due to get under way with Team New Zealand up
against Italian boat Mascalzone Latino- Capitalia at 1420
(1220GMT).


But light winds hovering around eight knots triggered a
succession of delays before organisers took the decision just
before 1700 to postpone Monday's matches.


One member of the Kiwi boat particularly frustrated by the calm
off Valencia's purpose built America's Cup port will have been
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, who was sitting in as the
boat's 18th 'man'.


The Kiwis are among 11 challengers hoping to earn the right to
tackle Alinghi in June's America's Cup by winning the Louis
Vuitton which comprises two sets of round robin stages, semi-
finals and final.


Monday's race programme will now be held over until the reserve
day on Friday.


Tuesday's schedule, weather permitting, kicks off with former
America's Cup finalist Luna Rossa of Italy against Cup debutants
United Internet Team Germany.
