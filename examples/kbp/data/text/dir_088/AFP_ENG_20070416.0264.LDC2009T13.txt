An opposition candidate has won the governorship poll in
Nigeria's southeastern state of Abia despite being in jail, the
electoral agency INEC said Monday.


Theodore Ahamefule Orji of the Progressive People's Alliance
(PPA), who has been detained over corruption charges by the
country's anti-graft agency EFCC, beat the candidate of the
ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP).


Orji became the second politician to win election from prison
since Nigeria returned to civil rule in 1999.


Senator Iyiola Omisore of the PDP won his seat in 2003 while
standing trial for the alleged murder of former justice minister
Bola Ige, who was killed in his home in December 2001.
