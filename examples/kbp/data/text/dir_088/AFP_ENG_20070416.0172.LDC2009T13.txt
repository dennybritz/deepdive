Thousands of rabbits had Hungarian police and firefighters on the
hop early Monday when they escaped on to a key motorway following
an accident.


Police said nearly 5,000 rabbits were on the loose around the M1
highway linking the capital Budapest to the Austrian border after
an accident involving the truck that was transporting them.


Traffic had to be diverted to a secondary road, a police
spokeswoman said.
