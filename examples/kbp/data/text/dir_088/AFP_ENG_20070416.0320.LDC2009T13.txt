More than 200 participants from around the world are set to take
part in a conference on the future of the biofuel sector here on
Tuesday, which organisers say is one of the first in Europe.


The two-day summit comes less than two months after the European
Union set a new target for its 27 member countries to replace 10
percent of petrol and diesel with biofuels by 2010.


Researchers, government representatives and biofuel experts are
scheduled to take part in the Madrid event, which has the backing
of Spain's industry ministry and is organised by German
consultant Survey Marketing and Consulting.


"We wish to become a reference on the issue," the organisers said
in a statement.


Europe is one of the world's top producers of biofuels, which can
substitute fossil fuels and are seen as a way to cut emissions of
greenhouse gases that are believed to contribute to global
warming.
