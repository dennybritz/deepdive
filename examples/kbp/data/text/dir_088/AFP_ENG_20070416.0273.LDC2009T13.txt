Former French film star and animal rights activist Brigitte
Bardot has appealed to the mayor of Kosovo's capital Pristina to
call off a planned hunt for stray dogs.


"Kosovo has survived a lot of dramas in the previous years, but
by no means should that justify a barbarian act to eradicate the
most loyal and best friend of man," Bardot said in a letter to
mayor Ismet Beqiri.


Officials at Pristina City Hall confirmed the local government
was planning to invite hunters to shoot stray dogs in a bid to
reduce the number of the animals on the streets.


A similar operation was conducted earlier this year in the Kosovo
town of Mitrovica, some 40 kilometres (24 miles) north of
Pristina.


"The use of force against the feeble is a cowardly act," Bardot
said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by AFP.


"I beg you to intervene in favour of a ceasefire," she said,
adding the "dog population could be controlled and limited in
sterilisation campaigns".


"It is urgent to put an end to this killing in the open and solve
the problem of abandoned dogs with more dignity," she wrote.


Bardot, 72, founded a wildlife foundation 20 years ago and is a
well-known supporter of far-right French politician Jean-Marie Le
Pen.
