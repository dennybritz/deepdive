A spring storm was battering the northeastern United States on
Monday after grounding hundreds of flights and causing localized
flooding in several parts of the region at the weekend.


High winds whipped up waves in the Atlantic Ocean and caused
flooding in coastal areas, while officials in New York City
reported near record rainfall of almost 19 centimeters (7.5
inches).


Connecticut authorities reported high winds and downed trees in
several areas, while New Jersey called a state of emergency and
advised people not to travel unless necessary.


In Massachusetts, the Boston marathon kicked off as planned,
despite pouring rain and wind gusts of up to 80 kilometers per
hour (50 miles per hour), organizers said, describing the
conditions as "dreadful."


Flood warnings were in place along a broad swathe of the east
coast, from Maine in the north down to Pennsylvania, the National
Weather Service said.
