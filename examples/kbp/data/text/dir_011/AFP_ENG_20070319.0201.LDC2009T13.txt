For the first time in more than 200 years, a pair of bald eagles
have nested in Philadelphia, of the biggest cities in the United
States, Pennsylvania state wildlife officials said.


"This find is an historic moment that returns some of
Pennsylvania's native wildlife to the doorstep of its largest
city," Dan Brauning, wildlife diversity supervisor with the
Pennsylvania Game Commission, said in a statement.


He added the discovery of an eagle nest within Philadelphia city
limits "demonstrates the resilience of this species and its
apparent growing tolerance to human activity."


Commission officials have declined to reveal the exact location
of the nest to avoid any disturbance for the birds. The bald
eagle is listed as a "threatened species" by the US government.


But due to active conservation measures, the population of the
birds, the most recognizable symbol of the United States, has
dramatically recovered.


If in 1963 there were only 487 active nests in the contiguous 48
states, now the numbers have reached an estimated 7,066 breeding
pairs, according to government officials.
