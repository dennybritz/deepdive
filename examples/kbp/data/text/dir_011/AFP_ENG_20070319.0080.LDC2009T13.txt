Chinese President Hu Jintao will visit Russia for a three-day
visit from March 26 at the invitation of his Russian counterpart
Vladimir Putin, the Russian president's press office said Monday.


The two leaders will take part in ceremonies marking the year of
China in Russia and are due to inaugurate an exhibition about
China in Moscow, the press office said in a statement.


Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, who announced the visit
earlier this month without giving a precise date, said the talks
would reinforce "strategic partnership" between Russia and China.
