Volkswagen, Europe's leading car maker, is close to reaching a
deal to take over the manufacturing unit of ailing Malaysian car
maker Proton, VW's head of international sales told the Financial
Times in an interview Monday.


VW was "very close" to striking a deal that would give the German
giant a large slice of southeast Asia's biggest passenger car
market, sales chief Kevin Rose told the newspaper.


A final deal could be inked as early as next week, he said.


The Malaysian government wants to sell a 50-percent stake in
Proton and transfer management to a western group in order to
help shore up the company, which reported a loss of 80 million
dollars (60 million euros) in the last three months of 2006.


Proton's passenger car sales fell by 11 percent to 490,000 units
last year and its market share fell to 32 percent from 40
percent.


Aside from VW, General Motors and PSA Peugeot had also originally
expressed an interest in the group, but the French auto maker has
since pulled out of the race.


Buying Proton would complement VW's plants in China and its Skoda
factory in India. The German giant sees the fast-growing
southeast Asian region as a big hole in its expansive Asian
strategy, FT said.


Rose told the newspaper that VW intended to build a new small
sedan and other models targeted at the Asia-Pacific region at
Proton plants if it won the deal.
