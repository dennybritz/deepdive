Newcastle United's Turkish midfielder Emre is being tracked by
Hertha Berlin, German newspaper BZ said on Monday.


BZ claims the transfer of Emre depends on the departure of
another Turkish midfielder, Yildiray Basturk.


"If Yil goes, we'll sign a real star," said Hertha manager Dieter
Hoeness, quoted in the newspaper.


BZ claims that Hertha's coach Falko Gotz knows Emre's agent Ahmet
Bulut well, having worked with him at Galatasaray.


Emre is a controversial figure having twice been accused of
making racist comments during games recently and he is being
investigated by the English Football Association.


The Turk has denied all allegations and said he would quit
England if he was found guilty.


According to BZ, if Emre does join, that could prevent Germany
goalkeeper Jens Lehmann from leaving Arsenal for the German
capital as there would not be enough finances to make such a deal
a reality.
