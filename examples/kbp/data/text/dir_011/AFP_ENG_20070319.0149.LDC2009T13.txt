A gas explosion ripped through a Siberian coal mine on Monday
where 168 people were working, a spokeswoman for the Russian
emergency situations ministry told AFP.


Twenty-one miners, three of them with injuries, have been rescued
so far from the Ulyanovskaya mine in Kemerovo region and extra
emergency teams have been dispatched to the scene of the blast,
the spokeswoman said.


"It was a methane gas explosion. The latest information is that
there were 168 miners inside at the time of the blast. Twenty-one
have been pulled out... The rescue operation is continuing," she
said.


The coal industry in Kemerovo, located in southwest Siberia near
Russia's border with Mongolia, has suffered from chronic
underfunding since the collapse of the Soviet Union and there
have been several accidents in recent years.


But a spokesman for the Kemerovo regional administration was
quoted by Interfax news agency as saying that the Ulyanovskaya
mine was only opened in 2002 and was equipped with modern
technology.


Regional governor Aman Tuleyev is travelling to the scene of the
accident and has set up a committee to look into possible causes
for the blast, the spokesman was quoted as saying.


Twenty-three miners were killed in a gas explosion in 2005 in
Kemerovo region and two separate mine blasts in the area in 2004
killed a total of 60 miners.
