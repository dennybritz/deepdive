Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev meets Russian President
Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Monday amid Russian concern at
Kazakhstan's increasingly pro- Western energy policy, the
Kommersant daily said.


Putin and Nazarbayev will discuss "strategic" issues, including
"existing and future routes for energy transport and joint
exploitation of Caspian Sea energy reserves," a Kremlin official
said ahead of the talks.


Kommersant said that the backdrop to the talks was frustration in
Moscow at Kazakhstan's readiness to supply oil to Europe without
going through Russia and to tap Caspian Sea reserves without
Russian help.


Moscow has long considered Kazakhstan, a Central Asian state that
is becoming one of the world's leading oil producers, part of its
sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union.


"Above all, the Kremlin is seriously concerned about increased
contacts between Astana and the West over the creation of energy
transport routes from Central Asia that would avoid Russia," the
daily said.


In recent months, Kazakhstan has said it will supply the Baku-
Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline that connects the Caspian to the
Mediterranean without going through Russia and has vowed to
strengthen energy ties with the European Union.
