The father of a BBC journalist kidnapped at gunpoint in the Gaza
Strip a week ago appealed Monday for his son's immediate release,
saying it was "no way to treat a friend of the Palestinian
people."


Alan Johnston, the London-based broadcaster's main correspondent
in Gaza, was forced from his car by gunmen while driving home
from work on March 12. There has been no information on his
whereabouts since.


"Holding Alan is not doing the Palestinian people any favours,
quite the opposite," said his father Graham Johnston, in a video
released by the BBC. "It's no way to treat a friend of the
Palestinian people.


"All I can say to the men who are holding Alan (is) please let my
son go, now, today."


The 44-year-old Johnston, an experienced reporter whose previous
postings have included Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, has been
reporting for the BBC from Gaza for three years, one of the few
Western journalists to be based in the increasingly lawless
territory.
