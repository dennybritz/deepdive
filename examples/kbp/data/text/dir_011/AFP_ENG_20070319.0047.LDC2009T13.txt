An Israeli ministerial commission is to meet on Monday to find an
official name for last year's war in Lebanon which has been
widely considered a failure in the Jewish state.


The army initially called its 34-day campaign against Lebanon's
Shiite militia Hezbollah "Operation Just Reward" after the
conflict broke out on July 12 and then renamed it "Operation
Change of Direction".


Israel's committee responsible for official ceremonies chaired by
cabinet minister Yaacov Ederi will now meet to decide if the
conflict merits the word "war" and discuss possible names, an
official said.


Defence Minister Amir Peretz, who faces nationwide calls to
resign over the conflict, has also commissioned two reserve
generals and a law professor to drum up a name.


The media coined the July 12 to August 14 conflict the Second
Lebanon War following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, dubbed
Operation Peace in Galilee.


Other names up for consideration are "the war in the north," "the
war against Hezbollah" or the "war to return the sons" -- two
Israeli soldiers whose capture by Hezbollah on July 12 triggered
the conflict.


Neither of the two soldiers have been freed, although more than
1,200 people in Lebanon were killed and more than 160 Israelis
died.


Israel has commissioned multiple investigations into the widely
perceived failures of the conflict in a bid to assuage public
criticism and protests from thousands of army reservists.
