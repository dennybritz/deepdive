Zimbabwe has recorded a significant decline in malaria prevalance
with recorded cases dropping from three million to 1.8 million in
the past year, a state-run daily reported Monday.


Portia Manangazira, a senior official in the ministry of health
told the Herald that the country had made significant strides in
addressing malaria, one of the leading killer diseases in the
country.


She said the decline was a result of measures which included
spraying of houses in malaria prone areas, more awareness
campaigns and distribution of treated mosquito nets to malaria
prone regions.


The decline would have been greater had Zimbabwe received timely
funding from Global Fund, Manangazira said.


"Because of funding problems, we were unable to fully adopt the
new policy (malaria treatment)... but now we have managed to
mobilise resources for the new policy," she said.


The new policy entails a new set and new combination of malaria
treatment drugs.


She added that Zimbabwe now had adequate stocks of new anti-
malaria drugs.


Forty percent of the world's population are at risk of
contracting malaria, a preventable disease which kills 4,500
people a day. Most of which are children under the age of five.
