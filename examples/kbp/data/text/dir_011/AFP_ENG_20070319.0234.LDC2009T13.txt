Everton striker Andrew Johnson warned Monday that he will be
gunning to make his mark when he joins up with Steve McClaren's
squad ahead of Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel and Andorra.


Johnson is tipped to partner Wayne Rooney in Saturday's Euro 2008
qualifier in Isreal after firing Everton to victory against
Arsenal at the weekend.


"It is great for confidence for me now that we are meeting up for
England on Tuesday," he said.


"I am really buzzing now, not just because it is England next but
because I have scored again and Everton are going so well. I'm
looking forward to England, I just hope I get the nod to play."


Johnson scored an injury-time winner against Arsenal and Everton
manager David Moyes believes the striker is now ready to make his
mark at international level.


"Andy is definitely up to the task of playing for England. If
England have got the players who can put him into the box, he
will get through and score.


"He is always a threat, always on the shoulder of the last
defender and he is always likely to get in behind a defence with
his pace."


Moyes added: "It was terrific for us to score like that in the
last minute to send the fans away happy.


"It was a big win for us, that is four points we have taken from
Arsenal this season and we have done that also to Liverpool, so
we are moving in the right direction."
