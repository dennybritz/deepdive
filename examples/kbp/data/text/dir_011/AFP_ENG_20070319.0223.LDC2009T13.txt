India's largest conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. Monday said
it will invest 9.2 billion dollars to produce and pipe natural
gas from fields around the country's southeastern coast.


"The company will begin producing 40 million cubic meters (1,413
cubic feet) per day by June 2008 and raise it to peak output of
80 million cubic metres in the next five months," said P.M.S.
Prasad, chief of the company's oil and gas arm.


Prasad also said the company will plough 5.2 billion dollars into
production in the Godavari river basin where it won exploration
and extraction rights from the Indian government.


The company will invest four billion dollars to lay a
1,386-kilometre (861-mile) pipeline from the southeastern state
of Andhra Pradesh to western Gujarat state to transport the
natural petroleum gas, he added.


The company owns the world's third largest refinery in Gujarat's
Jamnagar city, where it produces 33 million tonnes a year of
refined products -- petrol, diesel, kerosene and liquefied
petroleum gas -- and petrochemicals.


Reliance has dominated India's economy for decades with
activities in petrochemicals, oil and gas, refining, power,
insurance and telecommunications.
