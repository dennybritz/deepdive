The wife of a former Iranian general who went missing in Istanbul
accused Turkey on Monday of giving him away to Israel, the
student ISNA news agency reported.


"We know nothing of his fate, only that Turkish intelligence
forces handed him to Israel," said Sima Ahmadi, the wife of Ali
Reza Asghari, a former deputy defence minister who vanished while
on a private trip to Turkey last month.


"My husband was kidnapped ... the Turkish government is
responsible and it must inform us of his fate as soon as
possible," she said, while demonstrating outside the Turkish
embassy in Tehran with several family members.


Last week, the family made a complaint to the embassy over his
disappearance.


Asghari went missing in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul last month
shortly after checking into a luxury hotel on a private visit,
according to press reports.


"This is an American and Israeli job," his wife said. Earlier
this month she denied reports that her husband had defected.


The Washington Post reported last week that Asghari had left his
country and was cooperating voluntarily with Western intelligence
agencies while the Sunday Times of London alleged he had been
spying on Iran since 2003.


Iran has charged that Asghari may have been kidnapped by Western
spy agencies and has sent diplomats to Turkey to investigate.
