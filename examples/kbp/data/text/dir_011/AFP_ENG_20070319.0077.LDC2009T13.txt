Turkish police said Monday they had detained 12 suspected Kurdish
rebels and seized 11.7 kilos (25.7 pounds) of plastic explosives
believed intended for attacks against industrial facilities.


In a statement carried by the Anatolia news agency, police said
the suspected members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK) were detained last week.


They were arrested in simultaneous operations in Istanbul and the
neighbouring province of Kocaeli, in the country's northwest.


A search of the suspects' homes and cars led to the seizure of
the explosives, 10 detonators and illicit documents, the
statement added.


The suspects were planning to attack facilities in Kocaeli, the
country's industrial heartland, ahead of Newroz, the Kurdish New
Year, on March 21, the NTV news channel said.


Newroz has become an occasion for Turkey's Kurdish minority to
demand greater freedoms or demonstrate support for the PKK.
Celebrations have been marred by bloodshed in the past.


More than 37,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the PKK
took up arms for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast of
Turkey.


The group, listed as a terrorist organization by Ankara and much
of the international community, called a unilateral ceasefire on
October 1 last year, saying it hoped to pave the way for a
peaceful resolution of the conflict.


The truce, like previous ones called by the rebels, was rejected
by Turkey but fighting has decreased markedly since then.
