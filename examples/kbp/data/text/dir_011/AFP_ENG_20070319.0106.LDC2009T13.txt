TUI, Europe's biggest travel and tourism group, said Monday it
flew into the red last year, running up a net loss 847 million
euros (1.1 billion dollars) in 2006, compared with a net profit
of 496 million euros a year earlier.


Operating profit, as measured by earnings before interest, tax
and amortisation (EBITA) plunged by 73 percent to 232 million
euros despite a 7.0-percent rise in revenues to 20.916 billion
euros, TUI said in a statement.


Earlier, TUI had said that it had agreed to merge its tourism
division with British rival First Choice.
