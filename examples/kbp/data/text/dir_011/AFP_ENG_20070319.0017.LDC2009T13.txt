A Malaysian state warned it will seek to expel foreigners who
start up Islamic sects which do not preach traditional teachings,
according to a report Monday.


Religious officials from western Selangor, one of Malaysia's
wealthiest and most developed states, said they would urge the
federal National Registration Department (NRD) to withdraw their
permanent residency status.


"We warn permanent residents involved in deviationist cults that
we will take stern action against them by getting the NRD to
revoke their status," the Star daily quoted Abdul Rahman Palil,
the head of Selangor's Islamic affairs and youth committee, as
saying.


Abdul Rahman accused foreigners of introducing Islamic sects and
said the crackdown was necessary because of growing numbers of
"deviationist" groups.


Mainly Muslim Malaysia is wary of what it says are Islamic sects
that stray from traditional teachings and are considered
subversive.


In a separate report, Selangor's chief minister, Mohamad Khir
Toyo, called for websites of Islamic sects to be shut down.


"In this age of technological progress, there exist deviant
groups which have established websites with the intention of
influencing the people to join them, and this must be stopped,"
he was quoted as saying late Sunday by the Bernama news agency.


"Previously, deviant teachings were spread secretly, but now
these groups have become bold enough to poison the minds of
Muslims openly," he said.
