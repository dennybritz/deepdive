Japan's Sanyo Electric, under investigation for alleged
accounting irregularities, announced Monday the resignation of
its chairwoman Tomoyo Nonaka, one of Japan's highest-profile
female executives.


The company said in a statement that Nonaka had resigned for
personal reasons but local media reports said she had stepped
down because of the Sanyo board's refusal to fully probe
suspected window dressing of its figures.


Sanyo said last month that it would review its past earnings and
might correct its unconsolidated results for the four financial
years up to March 2004, after Japan's securities watchdog
launched a probe into its accounts.
