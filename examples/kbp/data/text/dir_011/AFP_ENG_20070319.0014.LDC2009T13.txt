Hong Kong authorities are struggling to replace 1,000-dollar
notes issued by banking giant HSBC in 2000 and 2002 after finding
more than 700,000 dollars (900,000 US) in high-quality fakes.


More than 700 1,000-dollar notes purportedly issued by HSBC were
found in the banking system last week, and 12 people from Hong
Kong, China and Vietnam have been arrested in connection with the
case.


Joseph Yam, the head of Hong Kong Monetary Authority, called on
people to return all notes of that denomination issued by HSBC
for those two years.


It was not clear exactly how many of them have circulated in the
city, but Yam said he believed the number was limited.


The discovery has caused panic in the southern Chinese territory,
and many shops are now rejecting such notes.


Police chief Tang King-shing said the bogus notes originated from
outside Hong Kong and that police were working with law
enforcement agencies overseas to smash the syndicate.
