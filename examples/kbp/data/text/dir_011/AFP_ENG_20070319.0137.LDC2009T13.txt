Russian Natalia Ischenko produced an immaculate performance to
win gold in the solo technical event of the synchronised swimming
competition at the world championships here Monday.


Ischenko, a silver medallist at the last world championships in
Montreal two years ago and gold medallist at the 2006 European
championships, scored an almost perfect 99 points.


Spain's "Princess of Barcelona" Gemma Mengual Civil, who won
bronze at the last two world championships, took the silver with
98 poiunts ahead of Japan's Saho Harada on 96.833.


Ischenko's stamina and power were unmatched as she successfully
completed her third competition routine of the day after
contesting preliminaries in the solo technical and team
technical.


"There was no certainty (of winning), I just tried. Now I don't
feel anything (because) I am too tired," Ischenko said.


"But I know I had very worthy competitors."


Ischenko was favourite to win after the reigning world solo
champion, France's Virginie Dedieu (FRA), missed the technical
event.


"I felt a lot better (in the final) than the morning
(preliminary), I felt more controlled," Civil said.


"It's going to be great for team morale. Hopefully, this will be
the first of many."


Harada said she was at first reluctant to compete in the solo
event when she was selected last year, but was now happy she was
persuaded to do so.


"When I was selected as a solo last December, I actually did not
want to do that. I thought I was impossible for me," Harada said.
"Now I want to say thank you to everybody who selected me."
