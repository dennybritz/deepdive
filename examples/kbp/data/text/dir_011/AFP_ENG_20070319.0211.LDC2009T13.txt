Finland's new parliament strengthened its position as one of the
most gender- equal assemblies in the world after weekend
elections, with the number of women MPs rising from 37.7 to 42
percent.


A total of 84 women were elected to the 200-seat Eduskunta, up
from 75 in the previous legislature.


Finland thereby exceeded the Council of Europe target of 40
percent women in parliament. Statistics published by the
organisation in March showed that only Sweden met the goal, with
46 percent.


Women candidates fared better however than their male
counterparts in Finland's election. Of the 2,004 candidates,
1,205 were men and 799 women, meaning women represented 39
percent of candidates but won 42 percent of seats.


The Christian Democrats and Centre Party had the weakest
proportion of women candidates, with 39.4 and 43.8 percent
respectively. That contrasted with 52.5 percent of candidates for
the Greens were women and 49.1 percent for the Social Democrats.


Fifty-two percent of registered voters were women.


The outgoing centre-left government, headed by Centre Prime
Minister Matti Vanhanen, consisted of 10 men and eight women.


Finland has had a woman president, Tarja Halonen, since 2000. She
was re-elected to a second six-year term in 2006.


The Centre Party remained the biggest formation in Sunday's
election, but is expected to switch to a centre-right alliance
following a stinging setback for its government ally the Social
Democrats and a strong showing by the opposition conservatives.
