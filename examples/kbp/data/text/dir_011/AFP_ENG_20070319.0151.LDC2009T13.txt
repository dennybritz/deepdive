An Israeli civilian was seriously wounded on Monday by
Palestinian gunfire at the Karni crossing between the Jewish
state and the volatile Gaza Strip, the army said.


The civilian, an employee of an Israeli electricity company, was
shot at as he repaired a high voltage line near the crossing, it
said.


The Karni crossing is the main crossing point for goods between
Israel and Gaza and has been mostly closed since an Israeli
soldier was seized by Gaza-based militants last June.
