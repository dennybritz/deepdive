An explosion ripped through a Siberian coal mine on Monday where
180 people were believed to be working, a spokesman for the
Russian emergency situations ministry told AFP.


"There has been an alert about an explosion at the Ulyanovskaya
mine in Kemerovo region.... According to preliminary information,
there were 180 people in the mine," the spokesman said.


"We have started to look through the rubble. Two emergency teams
have been sent to the scene" from the regional centre of
Kemerovo, he added.


The Kemerovo region is a coal mining heartland in southwest
Siberia near Russia's border with Mongolia.


The coal industry in Kemerovo has suffered from chronic
underfunding since the collapse of the Soviet Union and there
have been several accidents in recent years.


Twenty-three miners were killed in a 2005 blast in the region and
two separate explosions in 2004 killed a total of 60 miners.
