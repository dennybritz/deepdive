Hong Kong share prices closed 1.65 percent higher led by China
Mobile and select blue chips on expectations that they will post
strong 2006 results this week, dealers said.


They said fresh talk of A-share listings on the mainland by some
Hong Kong- listed firms, including China Mobile and Bank of
Communications, also helped sentiment.


China's interest rate hike had a muted impact on the market as
the move had been largely expected after a series of strong
economic data, with the Chinese markets also posting sharp gains
to provide additional support for Hong Kong.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 313.24 points at 19,266.74, off a
low of 18,967.41 and just off the day's high of 19,267.83.
Turnover was 38 billion dollars (4.78 billion US).
