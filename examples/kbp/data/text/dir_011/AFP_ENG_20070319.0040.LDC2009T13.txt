A senior foreign ministry official from Norway, the first
European country to normalise relations with the Palestinians
following the creation of a unity government, is due to meet
prime minister Ismail Haniya on Monday.


Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Raymond Johansen will meet the
Hamas premier as well as foreign minister Ziad Abu Amr in Gaza
City, just two days after the new government was sworn in,
Haniya's office said.


He will then travel to Ramallah in the West Bank for talks with
president Mahmud Abbas.


Norway, which is not a member of the European Union, announced on
Saturday it was normalising relations with the Palestinians
following the establishment of a government uniting the radical
Islamist Hamas movement with Abbas's secular Fatah party.


"In its programme, the unity government is taking important steps
towards complying with the international community's demands.
Norway will thus on this basis re-establish political and
economic relations with the Palestinian government," Foreign
Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said in a statement.


The international Quartet for Middle East peace -- the European
Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States --
slapped an aid and diplomatic boycott on the Palestinians a year
ago, after Hamas, considered a terror group in the West, first
came to power.
