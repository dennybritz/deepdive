Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his Armenian
counterpart were due Monday to inaugurate a natural gas pipeline
reducing energy-strapped Armenia's reliance on Russian gas.


Ahmadinejad and Armenian President Robert Kocharian were to
formally open the pipeline in the Armenian town of Meghri, near
the border with Iran.


Under a 20-year contract, Armenia is projected to receive 36
billion cubic metres of gas through the 141-kilometre (89-mile)
pipeline, breaking Russian gas giant Gazprom's stranglehold on
the ex-Soviet country's gas market.


An agreement to build the 200-million-dollar (150-million-euro)
pipeline was signed in 1992 but construction of the conduit only
began in 2004. Armenia will pay for the gas with electricity it
produces at a Soviet-era nuclear power plant.


Landlocked Armenia has sought closer links with Iran because of
an economic blockade imposed by neighbours Azerbaijan and Turkey
over the disputed Nagorno- Karabakh region.


Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a six-year war ending with an
uneasy ceasefire in 1994 over the majority ethnic-Armenian
enclave in Azerbaijan.
