Jia Tong and Chen Ruolin won China's second diving gold of the
night Monday, blitzing the opposition to clinch the women's 10m
synchronised platform world title.


Australia's Briony Cole and Melissa Wu took the silver with
Germany's Annett Gamm and Nora Subschinski earning the bronze.


The petite Chinese duo were never under threat, dominating the
competition from the outset to clock 361.32 and win by a massive
37 points.


It was a second successive triumph for Jia, still only 16, who
won the title at the last championships in Montreal two years ago
with former partner Yuan Pei Lin.


She linked up with Chen, 14, ahead of the Asian Games in Doha
last December and they went on to win that title.


Canada were fourth, the United States fifth and Russia sixth.
