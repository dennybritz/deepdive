Taiwanese gamers are bringing home thousands of new Nintendo Wii
consoles from the United States and Japan ahead of its release
here, with Premier Su Tseng- chang among its many fans.


Passengers have returned carrying 2,139 Wii consoles -- featuring
unique motion- sensitive controllers -- in the past three days
alone, according to customs figures.


"Unlike the other games, Wii is easy to play. It is a game for
different age groups of players," Kelia Ho, an analyst with the
private think-tank Topology Research Institute.


"When you play the game, not only your fingers are involved. Your
body needs to move. That's why it's fun," she told AFP.


Premier Su admitted he had been using the console, whose
controller allows players to mimic the movements of sports such
as tennis, bowling and golf, after his daughter brought one back
from the United States last month.


US sales have nearly matched those of rivals Xbox 360 and
PlayStation 3 combined, according to figures released last week
by NPD Group, since its release in November.


Nintendo have not announced a launch date for Taiwan but
unconfirmed media reports say it will be available here next
month.
