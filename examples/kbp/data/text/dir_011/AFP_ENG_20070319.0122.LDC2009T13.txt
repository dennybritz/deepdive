Two foreigners, believed to be Asians, and an Nigerian were
kidnapped this weekend in southeastern Nigerian state of Anambra,
the first such incident in that region, a government spokesman
said Monday.


The men were taken from their factory at Nnewi together with a
Nigerian worker, spokesman Mike Udah told AFP.


"We cannot say exactly where they come from. They are either
Chinese or Koreans," he said. No one had been hurt during the
abduction, he added.


State governor Peter Obi had already contacted the security
agencies with a view to securing the release of the men.


"We still don't know the motives behind the abduction because
this is the first such incident here. But this is an act of
criminality which we totally condemn," he said.


The past year has seen an upsurge in kidnappings of foreigners,
especially oil workers, by armed groups who say they are seeking
a larger share of Nigeria's oil wealth for the residents of the
volatile oil-rich Niger delta.


This year alone 58 foreigners have been abducted, but apart from
the victims of this weekend's abduction all of them have since
been released -- the latest being a Frenchman freed on Friday.


The most vocal of the armed groups, the Movement for the
Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND) has vowed further attacks on
Nigeria's oil industry unless their political demands were met.
