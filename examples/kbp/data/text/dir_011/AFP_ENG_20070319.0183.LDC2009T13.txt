Jordan on Monday reacted angrily to remarks attributed to Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert suggesting that an early US withdrawal
from Iraq could threaten the stability of the kingdom.


"These statements are rejected. The Israeli prime minister should
worry about his political future before worrying about us,"
government spokesman Nasser Jawdeh told a news conference.


Jawdeh referred to recent opinion polls showing that just two
percent of Israelis trust Olmert, who has been in office for less
than a year.


Israeli press reports last week quoted Olmert as saying that an
early US withdrawal from Iraq could threaten regional security.


"Israel is worried a hasty American withdrawal from Iraq could
topple the Hashemite regime in Jordan, one of the reasons that
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and others publicly oppose such a
move," the Haaretz newspaper quoted him as saying in a video
speech to the United States on March 12.


Jawdeh noted that Olmert's remarks coincided with renewed efforts
by Jordan to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ahead of an
Arab summit in Saudi Arabia later this month.


"We advise them before making such remarks to worry about their
own security which can only be achieved by establishing a
Palestinian state," he said. "This alone will guarantee security
and stability for everyone in the region."


Jordan's parliament also issued a statement "strongly condemning"
the comments attributed to Olmert, saying his remarks were
"aggressive" and "tactless," the state-run Petra news agency
reported.


Jordan and Israel have been bound by a peace treaty since 1994.
