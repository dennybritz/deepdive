Ten Rwandans claiming to have been recruited by deception by a
rebel leader in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have
surrendered to United Nations forces, a UN spokeswoman said
Monday.


Sylvie van den Wildenburg told AFP the men said they had deserted
from the forces of renegade DRC general Laurent Nkunda in Nord-
Kivu province, after being lured from Rwanda with promises of
jobs.


She said the UN mission had begun the process of returning them
to Rwanda.


The Kinshasa government has launched a plan to resolve unrest in
Nord-Kivu by forming joint units of the regular army with troops
loyal to Nkunda.


Rwandan Hutus opposed to the government in Kigali and so-called
Mai-Mai rebels are also active there.


But exactions against civilians have increased and in February
more than 50,000 people fled their homes in the province.


Local officials said that dozens of Rwandans had been brought
across the border at Runyoni, 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the
provincial capital of Goma, to swell Nkunda's forces.
