Europe's leading travel and tourism group TUI has approveed a
merger of its tourism division with British rival First Choice,
the groups announced in a joint statement on Monday.


"The boards of First Choice Holidays PLC and TUI AG are pleased
to announce the creation of one of the world's leading travel
groups, TUI Travel PLC," the statement said.


The move represents further consolidation of the European tourism
industry, with the announcement coming one month after package
holiday specialists Thomas Cook and MyTravel confirmed they were
to merge.
