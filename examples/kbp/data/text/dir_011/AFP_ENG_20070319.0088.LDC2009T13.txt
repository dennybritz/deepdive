Swiss watchmaker Swatch said Monday it saw "outstanding
prospects" for the year ahead after posting a record net profit
of 830 million Swiss francs (520 million euros, 692 million
dollars) in 2006.


"The first months of 2007 show a continuation of last year's
strong trend ... the group is expecting another very promising
year," the company said in a statement.


Net profit soared 33.7 percent to 830 million Swiss francs, above
analysts' forecasts, on net sales of 4.8 billion Swiss francs, up
12.3 percent from the previous year.


The company said foreign exchanges were currently favourable,
with the strong euro more than compensating for the relatively
weak US dollar. The weak yen remains an area of concern however.


Swatch's core Watches and Jewelry section recorded net sales of
3.7 billion Swiss francs, up 13.8 percent, and operating profit
of 738 million Swiss francs.


Operating profit growth was "remarkable," with price and volume
increases compensating for negative currency effects, higher
marketing costs and a new luxury tax in China, the company said.


"All Watches and Jewelry segment brands have additional growth
potential in all geographic regions," it added.


Swatch shares were higher in morning trade on the Zurich stock
exchange, up 2.4 percent at 310.25 Swiss francs.
