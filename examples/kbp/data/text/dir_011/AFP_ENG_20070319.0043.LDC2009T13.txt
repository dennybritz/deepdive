Tasmania fought back from the loss of five early wickets to be
283 for seven at the close of the opening day in Australia's
Sheffield Shield cricket final against New South Wales on Monday.


Paceman Damien Wright hit an unbeaten 57 while allrounder Luke
Butterworth remained 40 not out in an unbroken eighth-wicket
95-run stand to rescue Tasmania from 94 for five here at the
Bellerive Oval.


Paceman Doug Bollinger claimed the first five-wicket haul of his
first-class career with 5-57 off 21 overs.


Tasmanian skipper Dan Marsh and wicketkeeper Sean Clingeleffer
steadied the innings with a 79-run sixth wicket partnership
before Clingeleffer was caught in the slips for 41.


Marsh was next out for 44 when he was caught at second slip by
Nathan Hauritz attempting to drive Bollinger.


Tasmania are staging their first Sheffield Shield final and only
need a draw in the five-day final to claim an historic first
domestic title.
