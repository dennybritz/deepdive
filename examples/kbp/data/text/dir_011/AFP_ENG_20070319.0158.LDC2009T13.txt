Postbank, the banking arm of the semi-privatised German postal
service Deutsche Post, reported record 2006 results on Monday,
with net profit up by 42 percent at 695 million euros (924
million dollars) last year.


Pre-tax profit also topped expectations, rising by 32 percent at
941 million euros, Postbank said in a statement.


"We succeeded in mastering a Herculean task in 2006, which wasn't
easy," said chairman Wulf von Schimmelmann.


Postbank completed the integration of real estate financier BHW
and a number of Deutsche Post branches last year.


Profit growth was largely attributable to the retail banking
operations where pre-tax profit was up 15 percent at 924 million
euros. But the division also bore the brunt of the 85 million
euros in costs connected with the integration of BHW.


In the fourth quarter alone, Postbank was able to more than
double net profit on a 12-month basis to 271 million euros, while
pre-tax profit rose by 75 percent to 290 million euros.
