A suicide attacker drove an explosives-filled car into a vehicle
carrying foreigners in the Afghan capital Kabul on Monday,
officials said, but it was not immediately clear if there were
casualties.


"A (Toyota) Corolla slammed into a Land Cruiser carrying foreign
people," the interior ministry press office said.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in the
capital confirmed there had been an explosion on a main road in
the west of the city but could not say if foreign troops were
involved.
