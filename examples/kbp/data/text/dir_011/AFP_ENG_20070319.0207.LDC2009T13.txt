Rebels in the remote Afar region on the Ethiopian-Eritrean border
have claimed responsibility for the kidnappings of five Europeans
released last week in an interview on Eritrean state media.


Armed men claming to be from the Afar Revolutionary Democratic
Unity Front (ARDUF) made the claim in a broadcast on Eritrean
television late Sunday, including the first pictures of the
release of the European hostages.


"The main reason we took the hostages is because the TPLF
(Ethiopia) claims that ARDUF has been wiped out, and we needed to
expose the regime's false propaganda and declare our existence,"
an unnamed ARDUF spokesman said in Afar language.


"ARDUF is still fighting and will go on fighting."


The 20-minute interview included the first footage of the five
European hostages being released last Tuesday in Eritrea.


It showed the three men and two women shaking hands with and
waving to a group of around a dozen armed men in desert military
fatigues before being led away by Afar elders.


The five were then shown boarding an Eritrean military
helicopter, holding small rucksacks.


The report made no mention of eight Ethiopian hostages captured
in the northeast Ethiopian desert with the British embassy-linked
group on March 1 and still missing.


Eritrea has already said that the group was kidnapped by
separatist rebel group ARDUF, which opposes the division of the
Afar people among Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti.


Eritrea has strongly rejected Ethiopian accusations that it
masterminded the kidnapping.


Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a bitter territorial war between 1998
and 2000 and are still deeply at odds over their border.


Ethiopia on Saturday called for international help to obtain the
release of the eight missing Ethiopians.
