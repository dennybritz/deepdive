The high-profile son of Bangladesh's outgoing premier appeared in
court Monday to face extortion charges for the first time,
officials said.


Prosecutors formally submitted the charges against Tareque
Rahman, son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, to a special
tribunal in the capital, Dhaka, said prosecution official
Shahidul Haque Bhuiyan.


Rahman did not speak during the 15-minute hearing and bail was
refused by the presiding magistrate.


"The court has accepted the corruption charge sheet against him
and it also rejected his bail plea and remanded him until March
29," Bhuiyan told AFP.


Officials on Sunday formally laid charges against Rahman, who is
also the son of slain former president Ziaur Rahman.


He and his personal secretary are accused of extorting 10 million
taka (144 million dollars) from a businessman.


Rahman, widely seen as being groomed to take the leadership of
Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is among some 45
influential figures -- with links to both main political parties
-- who have been detained on suspicion of corruption.


The detentions are part of a major anti-graft crackdown by the
country's new military-backed interim government.


The caretaker government took over on January 12, after President
Iajuddin Ahmed stepped down as head of the earlier interim
government.


He also cancelled disputed elections, which the opposition said
had been rigged by the BNP, and imposed emergency rule.


The new government has pledged to clean up Bangladesh's
notoriously corrupt politics before holding credible elections.
