South Korea's Kia Motors said Monday it had signed an exclusive
deal to supply cars to the Chinese Football Association until
2010.


In a statement, Kia said it hoped the deal -- which also includes
unspecified financial aid -- would contribute to China's success
at this year's women's World Cup, next year's Beijing Olympic
Games and the men's 2010 World Cup.


No financial details were released. But Kia, an affiliate of
Hyundai Motor, said it would supply its latest models to the
association over the next three years.


Kia is already a sponsor of FIFA, football's world governing
body.
