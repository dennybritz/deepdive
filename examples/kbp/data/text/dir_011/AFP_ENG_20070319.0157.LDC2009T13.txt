Bangladesh's cricket board Monday paid tribute to Pakistan coach
Bob Woolmer, describing him as an excellent cricketer and a
pioneering coach whose sudden death was a "massive loss" to the
sport.


Woolmer, 58, died on Sunday in Kingston, Jamaica, after being
found unconscious at his hotel following Pakistan's surprise
World Cup defeat by Ireland.


"Woolmer was a fine cricketer in his time, a great cricket brain
and a top-class coach," the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said
in a statement.


"He was also the pioneer of bringing technology to cricket
coaching. His untimeley demise is a massive loss for the world of
cricket."


The BCB also praised Woolmer for his role in the development of
Bangladesh cricket through coaching stints in 2003.


"The Bangladesh Cricket Board is deeply saddened," the statement
added.


Bangladesh made a glorious start at the World Cup with a five-
wicket win over India in their opening match on Saturday.
