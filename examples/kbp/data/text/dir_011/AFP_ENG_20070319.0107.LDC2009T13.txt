Drought in northeastern China has left 700,000 people short of
water and forced farmers to scramble for supplies to keep crops
and livestock alive, state press reported Monday.


A 30 percent drop in normal rainfall in Liaoning province has
caused wells to dry up, forcing farmers to dig deeper for water
or to divert it from nearby reservoirs, Xinhua news agency
reported.


The drought has been exacerbated by global warming, with the
region experiencing its warmest winter in 56 years, the report
said.


Temperatures have risen an average 3.4 degrees Celsius (38
Fahrenheit) over normal levels, the report said, while
groundwater levels in the province's more arid west have dropped
by up to 35 centimeters (14 inches) from last year.


Over one million hectares (2.47 million acres) of farmland has
been affected by the drought, affecting 207,000 head of
livestock.
