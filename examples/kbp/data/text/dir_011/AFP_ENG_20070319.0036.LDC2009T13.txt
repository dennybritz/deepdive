New Thai football chief Worawi Makudi has vowed to improve the
fortunes of the Southeast Asian nation, aiming for a berth in the
World Cup within the next decade.


Makudi, a FIFA executive member, was unanimously elected as the
new president of the Football Association of Thailand (FAT) on
Sunday following the resignation of Vijit Getkaew.


"This new job is a challenge and I would like everyone to help me
to take Thai football forward," he said.


"We must push Thai football to improve at international level
because that is what the Thai people want."


Makudi, who was FAT's general secretary for 11 years, predicted
an appearance by Thailand at the World Cup might come sooner
rather than later.


"Participation in the World Cup is the dream of every fan," he
said.


"The FAT has done its utmost in the past to make it a reality.


"We have hope every time we contest that we can make it. After
the next two World Cups, I think our prospects will look
promising as there are several young players who are showing
great talent."


Thailand is a co-host of this year's Asian Cup finals but they
are in a tough group alongside Australia, Iraq and Oman.
