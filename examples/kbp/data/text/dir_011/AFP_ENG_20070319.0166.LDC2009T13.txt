Ten Palestinians, including two children, were wounded on Monday
when a blast ripped through a house belonging to a militant in
Gaza, with the cause of the explosion unclear, officials said.


The blast ripped through a two-storey house of Alaa al-Hissi, a
member of the radical Islamic Jihad group, in the Shatti refugee
camp and damaged five houses nearby, medics and security sources
said.


Officials said they were investigating the cause.


Numerous Palestinian militants have been killed in Gaza over the
past several years when bombs they were preparing exploded
prematurely.


Islamic Jihad has been responsible for most of the rocket attacks
and suicide bombings in Israel over the past few years.
