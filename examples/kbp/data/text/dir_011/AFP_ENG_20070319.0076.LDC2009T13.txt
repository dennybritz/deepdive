The majority of Israelis favour a dialogue with all or some
members of the new Palestinian unity government, according to a
poll published on Monday.


Thirty-nine percent of Israelis favour talks with the unity
government, while 17 percent favour talks with those cabinet
members not belonging to the radical Islamist Hamas movement,
which does not recognise the Jewish state's right to exist, the
poll said.


Forty percent think there should be no talks with the unity
cabinet at all, according to the poll published in the mass-
selling Yediot Aharonot.


The Palestinians on Saturday formed a unity administration
uniting Hamas with president Mahmud Abbas's secular Fatah faction
amid hopes that the new cabinet will lead the international
community to break its year-long boycott of the Palestinian
government.


Israel said it would not recognise the new Palestinian government
and would continue dealing only with Abbas and urged the West to
keep up its aid boycott.


The poll was conducted by the Dahaf Polling Institute and had a
4.3 percent margin of error.
