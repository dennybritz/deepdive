One hundred and thirteen Nigerians serving various jail terms in
Libya have been brought home to complete their sentences, an
airport official said Monday.


"The deportees were brought home at the request of President
Olusegun Obasanjo. They arrived the Lagos airport in a chartered
aircraft on Sunday," the official told AFP.


"There was an agreement between the two governments that the
Nigerians serving various prison terms in Libya should come home
to complete their sentences," he said.


He said the Nigerians were immediately arrested by security
agents and taken into custody as soon as they arrived the
country.


Hundreds of Nigerians seeking greener pasture in Europe and
America usually use Libya as a transit route.


They stay back in the north African country without any means of
livelihood when the mission fail, and some of them turn to crime.
