Kuwait's first private low-fare airline Jazeera Airways has
officially applied for listing on the Kuwait Stock Exchange
(KSE), the company said in a statement Monday.


"Listing Jazeera Airways on the KSE is an important step in our
long-term plans to build value for our shareholders," chairman
and chief executive officer Marwan Boodai said.


The process is expected to take between six and eight weeks, and
the airline expects to start trading its shares in the second
quarter, Boodai said.


The no-frills airline which made its maiden flight in October
2005, doubled its capital to 70 million dollars last year to fund
new expansions and the purchase of more aircraft.


At present, it has a fleet of five Airbus A320s and has ordered
five more for delivery by 2010 with an option for another six. It
has so far transported around 850,000 passengers.


The airline is now operating to 20 destinations in Egypt, India,
Iran, Jordan and Syria, in addition to Bahrain, Cyprus, Lebanon
and the United Arab Emirates.


Thirty percent of Jazeera is owned by a group of core founders
while the remaining 70 percent was offered to the public.


The airline was founded in 2004 by Boodai Group, a leading
Kuwaiti business group which has investments in the media,
transport and aviation sectors.


Jazeera offers very low fares with one-way tickets to Manama or
Dubai selling for as little as 34 dollars.
