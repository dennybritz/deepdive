England coach Steve McClaren on Monday called up Aston Villa's
Gareth Barry for the Euro 2008 double header with Israel and
Andorra.


Barry was left out of the original squad but has been called in
to fill the gap created by the absence of Manchester United
captain Gary Neville who suffered ankle ligament damage in
Premiership action at the weekend.


Barry looks set to compete with Liverpool defender Jamie
Carragher and Everton's Phil Neville for the left-back position.


Manchester City defender Micah Richards is also doubtful with a
calf injury.


Barry received his first call-up for nearly four years when
England played Spain in a friendly in February but the 26-year-
old was dropped for the games against Israel and Andorra.


The decision drew heavy criticisism from Villa boss Martin
O'Neill.
