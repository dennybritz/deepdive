The Macau Monetary Authority Monday said it would release 25
million dollars in North Korean funds frozen at a bank under US
financial sanctions.


In a statement, the authority said the decision on the cash in
the Banco Delta Asia (BDA) account was reached after it studied
information provided by the US Treasury department.


"(The authority) and the parties concerned analysed and reviewed
the information provided by the United States Department of the
Treasury last week in regards to their investigation on the North
Korea accounts," the authority said in a statement.


"As regards the treatment of the North Korea accounts, the
process will be in accordance with the instructions of the
account holders," it added.


Earlier Monday, the US said it had struck a deal to release the
money, which has been frozen at the Macau bank since 2005, due to
US allegations of money laundering and counterfeiting.


The US announcement came before the latest six-nation talks in
Beijing.


North Korea had insisted it would not implement a February 13
deal on disabling its main nuclear reactor until the financial
sanctions were lifted.


The issue was one of the major outstanding hurdles to the accord,
under which Pyongyang promised to begin shutting down its nuclear
programme in exchange for energy aid and diplomatic concessions.


Macau's Monetary Authority took control of BDA in late 2005,
after the US declared it a "primary money laundering concern."
