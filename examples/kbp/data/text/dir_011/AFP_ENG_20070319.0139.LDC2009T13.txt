An Israeli ministerial commission on Monday decided to officially
declare last year's conflict in Lebanon a "war," after the
government had previously refused to use the term.


Israel's committee responsible for official ceremonies chaired by
cabinet minister Yaacov Ederi "decided that the campaign in
Lebanon will be explicitly called a war," a statement said.


The committee also decided on three possible names for the 34-day
war which has been widely considered a failure in Israel -- "the
war in the north," "northern shield war" and "the second Lebanon
war," following Israel's 1982 invasion of its northern neighbour.


More than 160 Israelis and 1,200 Lebanese were killed during the
war, launched after Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah militia seized two
Israeli servicemen in a cross border raid on July 12.


The army initially called the campaign "Operation Just Reward"
and then renamed it "Operation Change of Direction."


Defence Minister Amir Peretz, who faces nationwide calls to
resign over the conflict, has also commissioned two reserve
generals and a law professor to drum up an official name.


Israel has commissioned multiple investigations into the widely
perceived failures of the conflict in a bid to assuage public
criticism and protests from thousands of army reservists.
