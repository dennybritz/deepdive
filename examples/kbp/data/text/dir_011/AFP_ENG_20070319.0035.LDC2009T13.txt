For Japanese people who want their lives to be even faster, a
company on Monday unveiled a washing machine billed to be the
quickest in the world.


Mitsubishi Electric said it has made the first machine that
changes angles automatically depending on the volume of clothes
and function.


The "Moving Drum" machine can wash nine kilograms (20 pounds) of
clothes in 35 minutes and dry six kilograms in 145 minutes --
half the time of a traditional washer.


"It's not only about saving time for users but also saving
energy," said company spokesman Kazuhiko Mizuno.


"We wanted to maximise the best of washing and the best of
drying. A straight tub is the best when washing, but a slanted
tub is the best for drying. So we combined the two functions," he
added.


The slant also means that clothes will not stick onto the walls
as in a normal machine, the company said.


The machine will go on sale from May throughout Japan, although
there are no plans yet for sales overseas.
