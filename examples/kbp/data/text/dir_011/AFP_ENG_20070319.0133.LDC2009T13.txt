German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned on Monday that her country
would not be blackmailed over demands to pull its troops out of
Afghanistan in return for freeing two Germans kidnapped in Iraq.


"The German government cannot be blackmailed," Merkel said after
talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.


"The crisis unit is doing everything it can to secure the lives
of the hostages. Naturally, given the situation, we are greatly
concerned.


"We know what our commitment to the civilian rebuilding means to
the Afghan government and we should not be blackmailed by people
who are terrorists."


Hannelore Krause, 61, who is married to an Iraqi doctor, and her
20-year-old son Sinan, who works at the Iraqi foreign ministry,
were seized on February 6.


A militant Islamist group in Iraq called the Kataeb Siham al-Haq
(Righteous Arrows Battalions) has threatened to execute the
hostages unless Germany pulls its soldiers out of Afghanistan.


Germany has nearly 3,000 troops in northern Afghanistan as part
of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.
