Five of the world's biggest natural gas producers are to set up a
gas market cartel at a meeting in Doha next month, Russia's
Kommersant daily reported on Monday.


Citing Arab diplomatic sources, Kommersant said a meeting of the
Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) in the Qatari capital on
April 9 "will be a good time to announce the creation of a
genuine gas cartel."


The sources were cited as saying that "political agreement for
the upcoming diplomatic move is already close to completion."


The founding members of the cartel would be Algeria, Iran, Qatar,
Russia and Venezuela, Kommersant said, quoting recent comments
favourable to the idea made by officials in those countries.


The creation of the GECF in 2001 led to speculation that the body
could become a gas market version of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel.


But experts are sceptical about the possibility of a world gas
cartel because of the difficulties in transporting natural gas
and the fact that gas is predominantly sold through long-term
contracts.
