On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the US-led invasion of
Iraq, tens or even hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are known to
have died violently, while almost 3,500 members of foreign forces
have also perished.


Approximate death toll by country:


- Iraqis: A study by US researchers published in October last
year estimated that about 655,000 Iraqi civilians had died since
the start of the occupation.


A report published a month later by the Iraqi authorities put the
figure at 150,000, while the British web site Iraqbodycount,
based on press reports, puts it at between 59,000 and just under
65,000 as of mid-March this year.


The Iraqi security forces say they have lost about 12,000
members.


Military casualties suffered by nations with troops in Iraq:


- United States: 3,220 as of Monday, according to an AFP count
based on Pentagon figures.


- Britain: 133 soldiers.


- Italy: 32, of whom 17 died in a single attack in 2003.


- Ukraine: 18


- Poland: 19


- Bulgaria 13


- Spain: 11


- Denmark: six


- El Salvador: five


- Slovakia: four


- Latvia: three


- Estonia: two


- Thailand: two


- The Netherlands: two


- The Czech Republic: one


- Kazakhstan: one


- Australia: one


- Hungary: one


- Romania: one


Of the countries listed, the following have now withdrawn all
their forces from Iraq: Spain, Thailand, the Netherlands,
Hungary, Ukraine, Italy and Slovakia.


NB: A number of the foreign troop deaths listed were due to
accidents and suicides rather than hostile action.
