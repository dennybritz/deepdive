Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa has sacked his brother-in-law
from the post of deputy lands minister after he was implicated in
a corruption scandal, his office announced Monday.


Moses Muteteka has been sacked with immediate effect to
facilitate investigations involving the allocation of land,
presidential spokesman David Konde said in a statement.


"President Mwanawasa has with immediate effect relieved Muteteka
of his duties. This follows allegations of corrupt practices in
the allocation of land at the ministry," Kombe said.


Muteteka also served as a senior aide to the president before he
entered mainstream politics in 2006.


Mwanawasa last month sacked lands minister Gladys Nyirongo in
connection with the same corruption investigation into
allegations that senior government officials have been allocating
land to themselves cheaply and then selling to investors.


The Zambian leader, who has made the fight against corruption as
his government's cornerstone, rated his lands ministry as the
most corrupt in the nation and ordered a police raid on the
ministry.
