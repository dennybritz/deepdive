A New Zealand-based club will compete in next season's Australian
A-League competition, Football Federation Australia said Monday.


A Wellington-based consortium has met the FFA's regulations to
field a team after the license of the Auckland-based New Zealand
Knights was revoked last December because of insolvency issues.


The Wellington bid satisfied the FFA that it had the necessary
financial capital and business plans to run a viable club in the
eight-team A-League, heading into its third season in August.


"I am very pleased to announce that following lengthy discussions
the FFA has granted New Zealand Soccer a three-year licence to
participate in the A-League," FFA chief executive Ben Buckley
said in a statement Monday.


"The (New Zealand) club can now officially begin the process of
recruiting the coaching and playing staff that form the only
fully professional football team in the region and continue the
long standing Trans-Tasman rivalry with the other seven
Australian-based clubs," Buckley said.


"FFA has always maintained the view that a New Zealand presence
in the Hyundai A-League benefits not only the competition, but
also the development of football in New Zealand and Oceania."
