Islamic militants Monday shot dead a policeman at a bazaar in a
northwestern Pakistani town adjoining a restive tribal-dominated
border area, police said.


Two unidentified armed attackers shot dead 35-year-old traffic
police constable Samiullah at a main market in the town of Tank
before fleeing, local police official Mir Abdullah told AFP.


The shooting appeared to be linked to a string of attacks on
policemen by suspected pro-Taliban militants in the region since
January, he said.


Tank borders the restive South Waziristan tribal district where
militants have sworn to avenge a January 16 airstrike by
Pakistani forces on an alleged Al- Qaeda camp.


Pakistan remains on high security alert after a recent wave of
terrorist attacks including five suicide bombings that killed
more than 40 people.
