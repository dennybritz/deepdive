A suicide attacker drove an explosives-filled car into a US
embassy convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul Monday, wounding some
embassy staff and at least one child, officials said.


The attack on the road to the eastern city of Jalalabad was the
first suicide bombing inside Kabul this year, after several
deadly blasts last year blamed on Taliban insurgents.


"There was a vehicle-borne IED (improvised explosive device) that
struck a US embassy convoy on Jalalabad Road," embassy spokesman
Joe Mellot told AFP.


"There were some injuries, including one seriously injured who
has been evacuated for treatment."


Ambassador Ronald Neumann was not in the convoy, he said.


An investigator at the scene and an eyewitness told AFP they had
seen one child being taken to hospital by ambulance.


Foreign troops sealed off the road, often used by US troops
travelling to the main US coalition base at Bagram outside the
capital and also the route to various military bases on the
outskirts of Kabul.


An AFP correspondent could see a vehicle in flames and a damaged
bullet-proof, four-by-four vehicle of they type used by
diplomatic missions and foreign forces in Afghanistan.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
confirmed there had been an explosion on the busy road but had no
details. The US-led coalition had no information.


There have been nine suicide bombings in Afghanistan in the past
week. The Taliban has vowed a wave of such blasts this year after
nearly 140 last year killed about 200 civilians and scores of
Afghan and foreign security officials.
