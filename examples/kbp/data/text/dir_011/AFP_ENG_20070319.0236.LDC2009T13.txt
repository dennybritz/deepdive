The Danish newspaper editor who chose to publish controversial
cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005 was on Monday awarded a
free press prize for his "determination and courage".


The Danish-based Free Press Society awarded Flemming Rose the
inaugural international Sappho Prize, which comes with 20,000
kroner (3,568 dollars, 2,685 euros).


The publication of the 12 cartoons in the daily Jyllands-Posten
in September 2005 prompted an international storm.


Lars Hedegaard of the Free Press Society said the prize honoured
a "journalist who combines excellence in his work with courage
and a refusal to compromise."


Hedegaard compared the pressure placed on Rose and his newspaper
to apologise for publishing the cartoons to those voices calling
for the appeasement of Nazi Germany at the dawn of World War II.


"Decisive to our decision was Rose's courage to print the
cartoons and to stand his ground under the worst storm any
journalist has ever endured," Hedegaard said.


Rose declined to comment on the award but told AFP he was
"thankful" for the recognition of his work.


Sappho is an ancient Greek poet from the island of Lesbos.


Hedegaard said her combination of traits that included being
European, a woman, lesbian, as well as having a willingness to
write her mind and a sense of political incorrectness, made her
the best symbol for freedom of the press in an age when European
values were threatened.


Norwegian human rights activist Hege Storhaug will present Rose
with the award on behalf of the Freedom of the Press Association
at a public ceremony on March 27.
