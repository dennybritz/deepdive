Two Britons, an American and a Finnish man were arrested in
Thailand's eastern resort town of Pattaya on Monday and charged
with sexually abusing under-aged girls, police said.


Glenn Richard Allen from the United States, a Finnish man
identified only by his first name Hero, and two Britons --
Maurice John Praill and Stephen James Ellison -- were charged
with molesting children aged under 15, police said.


"We have known for some time about an international gang of human
traffickers and pedophiles in Pattaya," said Major General
Kamronwit Thoopkrajang of the women and children's protection
division.


"We arrested the four after we got enough evidence that they were
involved in the gang and had earlier committed such crimes in
their homelands."


Kamronwit said Thai police had been working with counterparts
from Britain, the United States and Finland to track down the
suspects.


The men were arrested at four different locations in Pattaya, he
said, and police also seized evidence including video and film
cameras and electronic child pornography images.


If convicted, the four face up to 20 years each in prison.


Pattaya has recently been trying to shed its sleazy image and
crack down on child sex tourism, but child protection
organisations have warned that attempts to clean up the city may
just push the trade behind closed doors.
