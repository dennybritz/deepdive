Chinese duo Wang Feng and Qin Kai won the men's 3m synchronised
springboard diving gold medal at the World Swimming Championships
here Monday.


Canada's Alexandre Despatie and Arturo Miranda took silver and
Germany's Tobias Schellenberg and Andreas Wels earned the bronze.


It was the second successive victory for veteran Wang, who
partnered He Chong to gold at the world championships in Montreal
two years ago and at the Asian Games in Doha last December.


But this time He, who is famed for commanding a set of dives with
high degrees, choose to focus on solo diving giving Qin a chance
to shine.


It was an outstanding performance by the Chinese pair, who scored
458.76 points to Canada's 418.92 and Germany's 414.54, with the
United States relegated to fourth.


Germany's Schellenberg and Wels, long-time partners, will be
disappointed after taking second behind China in Montreal and at
the Athens Olympics but it was a triumphant return to top level
competition for Despatie.


The Canadian reigning 1m and 3m springboard world champion missed
most of last year with a serious neck injury.


China's victory came after a power outage midway through the
fourth of the six rounds of diving plunged the Melbourne Sports
and Aquatic Centre into darkness.


The problem was fixed after 20 minutes with the electronic
scoreboards unaffected.
