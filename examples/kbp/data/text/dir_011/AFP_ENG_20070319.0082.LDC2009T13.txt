The German presidency of the EU has said it is "outraged" by the
latest attack on an opposition politician in Zimbabwe.


"The EU presidency was outraged and deeply concerned by the news
of the arrest and brutal treatment of the opposition MP Nelson
Chamisa," Berlin said in statement issued late Sunday.


Chamisa, a spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change
(MDC), was stopped by security forces at Harare airport in Sunday
and beaten so badly that he needed surgery.


Chamisa was on his way to Belgium to attend an Africa Caribbean
Pacific (ACP) - European Union (EU). He was one of four
opposition activists prevented from leaving the country over the
weekend.


"The presidency condemns these actions by the security forces in
the strongest possible terms and calls on the Zimbabwean
government to release all detained opposition politicians
immediately, to enable them to have access to legal assistance
and medical care," Berlin said.


President Robert Mugabe, whom the MDC has vowed to oust, has so
far brushed aside international condemnation of the government
crack down on his political opponents.
