North Korea will close its main nuclear reactor once US financial
sanctions are lifted, the regime's chief atomic envoy told
negotiators at disarmament talks here on Monday, according to an
official.


"Nuclear activities will stop at Yongbyon if the sanctions are
fully lifted," the official, who is involved in the six-nation
talks, quoted Kim Kye-Gwan as telling his fellow chief envoys at
the start of the talks.


The official was speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity.


China's state-run television news also reported that North Korean
officials at the talks had indicated Pyongyang had already begun
preparatory work to shut down the Yongbyon reactor, without
giving further details.


The United States announced earlier Monday that it had struck a
deal with North Korea on their long-running financial sanctions
dispute, which has been a major stumbling block in the six-nation
disarmament talks.


All of the roughly 25 million dollars in North Korean funds
frozen in a Macau- based bank since 2005 over accusations of
money laundering and counterfeiting will be released, chief US
nuclear envoy Christopher Hill said.


North Korea has yet to make a public response to the US
announcement.
