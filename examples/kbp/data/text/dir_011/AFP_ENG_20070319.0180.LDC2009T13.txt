Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay revealed Monday that England
international full- back Chris Ashton has been offered 140,000
pounds (272,000 dollars) a year by Northampton to switch to rugby
union.


Lindsay said Ashton, who turns 20 later this month, was offered a
new two-year deal to stay in Super League but admitted they could
not match Northampton's wages because of the salary cap.


"We were rocked to learn from Chris' agent Andrew Clarke that he
has been offered 140,000 pounds a year by Northampton," Lindsay
told the Wigan Evening Post.


"For us to beat that would make him our highest paid player - and
that's not right for such a young man still making his way in the
game.


"It would bust the salary cap wide open, would not be fair to our
more experienced and senior players and would destabilise our
wage structure at the club.


"I also think that to go into rugby union now is a mistake for
Chris and that he is rushing into it."


Ashton is out of contract at the end of the year and is thought
to have agreed a three-year deal with Northampton, dependent on
them avoiding relegation.


Ashton is set to become the third Wigan player to switch codes,
following in the footsteps of Jason Robinson and Andy Farrell,
while former Wigan winger Brian Carney last week joined Munster.


Three other players, Karl Pryce (Bradford), Stephen Myler
(Salford) and Chev Walker (Leeds), switched codes at the end of
last season, joining Gloucester, Northampton and Bath
respectively.
