Europe's leading travel and tourism group TUI has approved a
merger of its tourism division with British rival First Choice,
the groups announced in a joint statement on Monday.


"The boards of First Choice Holidays PLC and TUI AG are pleased
to announce the creation of one of the world's leading travel
groups, TUI Travel PLC," the statement said.


The move represents further consolidation of the European tourism
industry, with the announcement coming one month after package
holiday specialists Thomas Cook and MyTravel confirmed they were
to merge.


TUI Travel was to have about 27 million customers in 20 markets,
according to details of Monday's statement. The new group would
be headquartered in Britain and its shares traded on the London
Stock Exchange.


It was estimated by TUI, a German group, and First Choice that
TUI Travel would have proforma revenues of 12.1 billion pounds
(17.6 billion euros, 23.4 billion dollars).


The pair also predicted the merger would deliver pre-tax cost
benefits of at least 100 million pounds annually, to be fully
realised within three years of completion.


TUI Travel would be 51 percent owned by TUI and 49 percent owned
by the existing shareholders of First Choice. TUI would
contribute 875 million euros of net financial debt, including all
pensions liabilities currently associated with TUI Travel, to the
new group.
