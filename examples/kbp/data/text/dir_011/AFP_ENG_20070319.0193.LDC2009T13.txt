Three coordinated car bombs and a mortar attack killed 15 people
and wounded at least 35 in Iraq's northern oil hub of Kirkuk on
Monday, police said.


The first and the biggest attack, a car bomb near two mosques,
killed 10 people and wounded eight, police Colonel Taha
Salaheddin told AFP.


The bomb went off in central Kirkuk's Sector 90 district which
houses the two mosques, one Shiite and one Sunni, as well as the
emergency police command, Salaheddin said.


He said 10 cars were completely burnt and 20 shops damaged.


The second car bomb went off in south Kirkuk's Ras Domeez market
near a branch of the Islamic Bank, killing five people and
wounding 26, he said.


Of the five killed, four were policemen whose patrol was passing
by at the time of the blast.


The mortar attack near the city's civil defence office left one
civilian wounded, Salaheddin said, adding that the fourth car
bomb targeted a senior officer from Saddam Hussein's former army
and destroyed a communication tower but caused no casualties.


All the attacks took place within 30 minutes, with the first car
bomb exploding at around 1:00 pm (1000 GMT), Salaheddin said.


Over the past few months, insurgents have stepped up attacks in
Kirkuk, an ethnically mixed city claimed by both Arabs and Kurds.
