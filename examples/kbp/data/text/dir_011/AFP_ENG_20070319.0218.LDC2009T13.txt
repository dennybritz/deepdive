Nigeria's foreign currency reserves have dropped to 41.95 billion
dollars from 43.39 billion dollars in February 2007, the Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said Monday.


The CBN said the 3.3 percent fall in the reserves in the month
was as a result of sliding international price of crude oil.


Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer, exporting 2.6 million
barrels a day and deriving around 90 percent of its foreign
earnings from the sector.


World oil prices have fallen in the past month, hovering between
57 and 60 dollars per barrel as traders express caution over an
OPEC decision to keep its crude production levels steady.


Nigeria's reserves began to build from April 2006 when the figure
climbed to 37 billion dollars. The figure rose to 42.65 billion
dollars in the first weeks of 2007.
