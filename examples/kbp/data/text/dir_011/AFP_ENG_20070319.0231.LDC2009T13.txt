Rangers face an anxious wait to see if they will be charged by
UEFA over alleged sectarian chanting by sections of their support
during a UEFA Cup tie against Spaniards Osasuna.


UEFA have confirmed they are aware of allegations about the
chanting and have started gathering evidence.


The news comes hot on the heels of reports that a video posted on
the internet shows supporters apparently singing a sectarian song
in the El Sadar stadium after Wednesday's match.


Rangers have already been fined 13,000 pounds (25,000 dollars) by
UEFA last May for discriminatory chanting during a Champions
League tie against Villarreal.


A UEFA spokesman said: "We have been made fully aware of the
situation. Rangers have some history regarding this and that
could be taken into account.


"UEFA are gathering evidence and we are still waiting on reports,
such as the security officer's report.


"Once we have all the reports, the disciplinary unit may decide
to open an investigation. It is too early to say at the moment."


The security officer's report will also determine whether UEFA
investigate Rangers's claims of heavy-handed policing at the
match.


Rangers supporters claimed riot police charged into their section
for no reason, lashing out with sticks, fists and kicks before,
during and after the match in Pamplona.


The Glasgow club have since officially complained to UEFA about
the lack of segregation and policing at the match. The report is
expected to arrive at UEFA head-quarters later Monday.
