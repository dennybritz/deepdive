UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he had found reports coming
from the Palestinian government "disappointing" after a new
Fatah-Hamas coalition declared its right to all forms of
resistance.


"Initial reports coming from this national unity government seem
to be a little bit disappointing," Ban said in an interview aired
late Sunday by the Voice of America.


The international Quartet, which comprises the United States,
Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, has recently
reiterated that the Palestinian government must recognize Israel;
accept previous agreements signed with it; and renounce violence
in order to see aid resumed.


"They have not clearly stated they will abide by these three
principles," Ban said of the Palestinians.


Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya insisted Sunday on his
new government's right to all forms of resistance, which US
officials have denounced.


The new Palestinian cabinet -- uniting long-time rivals Fatah and
Hamas -- met for the first time Sunday in Gaza City and by video
link in Ramallah, a day after Haniya presented his government's
program to parliament.
