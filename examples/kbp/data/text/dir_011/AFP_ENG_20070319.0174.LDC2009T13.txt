South Sydney gave their army of supporters hope for better times
ahead with an 18-6 win over National Rugby League arch-rivals
Sydney Roosters here Monday.


The Rabbitohs, buttressed by several big-money off-season
signings, led 12-0 at half-time and were never headed racing in
three tries to one to outclass the Chris Anderson-coached
Roosters.


The new recruits, under the coaching of Jason Taylor, all
justified their hefty contracts led by forwards Roy Asotasi and
David Kidwell.


Playing behind a dominant forward pack scrum-half, Joe Williams
showed signs of living up to his ability and his combination with
new stand-off Jeremy Smith was impressive as they played a
leading role in all three of the Rabbitohs' tries.


The Rabbitohs, part-owned and funded by Hollywood actor Russell
Crowe, won their first NRL season opener since being re-admitted
to the competition in 2002.
