Afghan President Hamid Karzai said here he hoped that an Italian
journalist captured two weeks ago in Afghanistan would be freed
on Monday.


"I hope the matter is resolved today. He should either be freed
by now or in the process of being freed," Karzai said after talks
with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.


"We did what we could to help in the release of the Italian
journalist," Karzai said.


Daniele Mastrogiacomo was captured on March 4 with two Afghan
colleagues in the province of Helmand, a Taliban stronghold.


The Taliban said on Sunday it had handed Mastrogiacomo over to
tribal elders pending a final deal for his release.
