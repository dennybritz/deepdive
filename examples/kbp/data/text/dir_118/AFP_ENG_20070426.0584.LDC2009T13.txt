Indian budget airline SpiceJet has placed an order worth 700
million dollars at list prices for 10 Boeing 737-800 passenger
planes, the companies said Thursday.


The order adds to 30 Boeing 737s already in the pipeline for the
low-cost airline.


"These aircraft are enabling us to add capacity on new and
existing routes, and will continue to support SpiceJet's mission
of being India's preferred low-cost airline," SpiceJet board
director Bhulo Kansagra said in a statement.


SpiceJet started operations in May 2005 and holds around six
percent of India's commercial airline market, using a fleet now
of 11 Boeing 737-800s.


The New Delhi-based carrier plans to use the 10 new planes, which
can each carry up to 189 passengers, on short- and medium-haul
flights within India.
