An obsessed fan tried to run over the husband of Sandra Bullock
in an attack at the couple's home in California, police said
Thursday.


Police told AFP that a woman, Marcia Valentine, attempted to mow
down Jesse James during the incident at the couple's home.


TMZ.com celebrity website reported that the attack took place as
Bullock and James' 10-year-old son Jesse Jr looked on.


A spokesman for Orange County police south of Los Angeles
confirmed to AFP that the incident occurred after Valentine was
discovered lying on the driveway of the couple's home.


"Mr James found the suspect, Marcia Valentine, lying on their
driveway," officer Jim Amormino said.


"He asked her to leave, but instead she got into her car and
tried to run him over three to four times. We are treating it as
assault with a deadly weapon."


Valentine was arrested early Monday and was released on Tuesday
after posting bail of 25,000 dollars. She is due to appear in
court on May 22.


A spokeswoman for Bullock, 42, confirmed the incident.


"Both Jesse James and Sandra Bullock are fine and it is now in
the hands of the authorities," Cheryl Maisel told People.


Bullock, the star of "Speed," "Miss Congeniality" and last year's
best picture Oscar-winner "Crash" has suffered problems with
stalkers in the past.


In 2006 she won a three-year restraining order against a man she
has accused of stalking her across three US states.
