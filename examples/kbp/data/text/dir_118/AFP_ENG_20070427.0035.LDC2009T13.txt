Israel Friday denied claims by the Lebanese army that an Israeli
military patrol had crossed the day before into southern Lebanon,
a military spokesman in Tel Aviv said.


"Our forces conducted Thursday a routine patrol south of the
international Israeli-Lebanese border, and not in Lebanese
territory, and UNIFIL (UN Interim Force) confirmed that," the
spokesman told AFP.


According to a statement from the Lebanese army Thursday, a
10-member Israeli enemy patrol crossed the electronic fence on
the Saddani hills, between the towns of Kfarshuba and Shebaa and
entered Lebanese territory between 50 meters and 100 meters
(yards).


A unit from the UN Interim Force intervened and forced the
Israeli patrol to withdraw, it said.


Asked about the incident, a UNIFIL officer told AFP "UNIFIL sent
technical experts to acertain the facts."
