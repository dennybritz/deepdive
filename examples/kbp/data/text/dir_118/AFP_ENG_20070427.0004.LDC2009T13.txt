German memory chip maker Qimonda will invest two billion euros
(2.71 billion US) into a new factory in Singapore over the next
five years, the company has said.


The Singapore factory, which will be Qimonda's first-fully owned
facility in Asia, will make DRAM memory chips on 300-millimetre
(12-inch) wafer chips, the Munich-based company said in a
statement monitored Friday on its website.


"Our investment in Singapore is a major step to expand our
regional presence in the Asia market," said Loh Wah Kin, the
company's president and chief executive.


"We are responding to the fast growing DRAM market and are moving
closer to our customers in Asia."


The facility will add 60,000 wafers a month to Qimonda's overall
capacity.


Construction of the Singapore facility is expected to start at
the end of the year and production will begin in 2009, the
company said.


Qimonda, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was spun
off from semiconductor giant Infineon in 2006. It had sales of
3.81 billion euros in its 2006 financial year.
