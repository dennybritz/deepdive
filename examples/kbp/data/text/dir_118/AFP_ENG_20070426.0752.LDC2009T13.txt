The US state of Texas on Thursday executed a man convicted of
murdering a grocery store owner and his wife during a 1994
robbery to steal beer.


Ryan Dickson, 30, was pronounced dead at 6:12 pm (2312 GMT),
three minutes after the start of a lethal injection at the prison
in Huntsville, southern Texas, according to prison documents.


Dickson was the 15th inmate put to death this year in the United
States.


Before his execution, he apologized to the family of his victims
and said goodbye to his family.


Dickson was 18 when he and his half-brother, 15, entered a
grocery store in Amarillo, Texas in an attempt to steal beer.


Confronted by the store owner, Dickson pulled a sawed-off
22-caliber rifle from underneath his coat and shot the store
owner once in the chest, according to the prison documents.


He then shot the store owner's wife in the face even though she
had placed all the money in the cash register on the counter for
the robbers to take.


The robbers stole 52 dollars in cash and an undetermined amount
of beer.


Texas has executed 13 of the 15 prisoners put to death so far
this year in the United States.


The United States has more than 3,300 prisoners on death row.


Several US states have suspended death sentence executions as
debate grows as to whether the three-drug cocktail administered
to most condemned men violates the constitutional ban on "cruel
and unusual punishments."


Rights groups and medical advocates say the procedure is not
scientific, often faulty and may result in an agonizing end to
life.
