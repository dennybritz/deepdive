A South Korean man who fled to Brazil after being convicted of
defrauding a local carmaker of 400 million dollars will be
extradited next month, officials said Friday.


Jeon Jong-Jin, who once headed the Brazilian branch of a now-
defunct subsidiary of Kia Motors, was sentenced to seven years by
a South Korean court but left for Brazil in 2001 while on bail,
the justice ministry said.


The Supreme Court sentenced him to 10 years in 2003.


Brazilian police arrested Jeon last July, and a Brazilian court
decided this week to send him back to South Korea, the ministry
said.


"Brazilian authorities will extradite him next month under an
extradition treaty with our country. Upon his arrival, he should
serve his sentence," spokesman Park Jae-Kyu told AFP.


Jeon, 43, failed to pay Kia Motors 200 million dollars for
deliveries to Brazil from 1996 to 1997. He was also found guilty
of causing Kia to pay another 200 million dollars for the
expansion of his branch in Brazil.


The case had aggravated the financial strains of Kia, which was
absorbed by South Korea's leading carmaker Hyundai Motor in 1998.
