Denmark, one of Washington's closest allies in the Iraq war, on
Thursday criticised the United States for taking nearly four
months to inform Copenhagen of the arrest of a Dane in Iraq.


Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said "the Danish citizen has
been detained since December in Iraq. But the foreign ministry
was only informed on March 28."


He said Copenhagen had made its displeasure known but Washington
explained the delay by saying the man "had not been registered as
a Dane but as an Iraqi national."


The man had been detained for straying too close to an arms
depot.


The minister told a parliamentary foreign affairs committee that
the ministry was in touch with the detainee and was "exerting
pressure so that the situation can be cleared as soon as
possible."


The arrested man said he had been released by an Iraqi judge
after his arrest but was then kept in detention by US forces, who
have a mandate from the UN Security Council to detain anyone
posing a security threat in Iraq for up to 18 months.


Denmark has about 460 soldiers in Iraq. Six Danish soldiers have
been killed in Iraq since 2003.
