Sean O'Hair, who finished no worse than 15th in his last four
events, has a one- shot lead after Thursday's opening round of
the 6.3 million dollar Byron Nelson Championship.


O'Hair tamed cool and windy morning conditions to card seven
birdies in a five- under-par 65 at Cottonwood Valley.


"All in all, I feel pretty good with my ball-striking, and it was
just a really nice round of golf," O'Hair said.


Defending champion Brett Wetterich and Dane Anders Hansen are one
shot back.


Phil Mickelson, who controversially was allowed to play despite
missing Wednesday's pro-am event, finished poorly for a one-under
69, a score matched by Vijay Singh.


"The wind was really brutal at the beginning," O'Hair said. "That
first hole, I nailed a drive, hit it 300 yards-plus, and I still
had a five-wood in, so it was playing pretty tough out there."


O'Hair, 24, scored his lone PGA Tour victory at the John Deere
Classic nearly two years ago, shortly after firing coach Steve
Dahlby, but after a mediocre season last year - 62nd on the money
list - he decided to rehire his old instructor.


"Immediately, the chemistry was there, and things started
clicking," O'Hair said of the reunion. "I've been working hard
for the past year-and-a-half on my backswing and it really hasn't
been making too much sense."
