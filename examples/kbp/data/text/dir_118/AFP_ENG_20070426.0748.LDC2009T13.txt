Two people were killed and 10 seriously injured when armed men
fired on a convoy of political candidates in the northern
Philippines, police said Friday.


It was the latest and worst outbreak of violence in the run-up to
the May 14 mid-term elections which has already claimed at least
20 lives.


The convoy, carrying political allies and sons of former mayor
Antonio Esquivel, was fired upon in the northern province of
Nueva Ecija late Thursday, resulting in the death of a town
council candidate and a police escort.


Also wounded in the attack were 10 other people including three
police escorts and Esquivel's two sons, Mark Lawrence and Mark
Anthony, the police report said.


The two sons had to be rushed to Manila for emergency surgery
after suffering gunshot wounds to the head.


The Esquivels immediately blamed a political rival for the
attack, saying their group had been ambushed as it returned from
a village meeting.


Elections in the Philippines are often marred by violence as
rival groups use force to intimidate voters or political
opponents.


There were 148 deaths recorded during the presidential elections
in 2004 and 111 deaths linked to the congressional and local
elections in 2001, police officials have said.


Next months some 45 million voters will elect half the 24 seat
Senate, 253 congressmen, and more than 18,000 local, district and
provincial officials.
