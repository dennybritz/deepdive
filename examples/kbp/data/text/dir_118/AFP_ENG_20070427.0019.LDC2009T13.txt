One person died and at least 43 were injured in central Tallinn
in an overnight looting rampage and clashes with police after a
protest near a Soviet war monument, officials said Friday.


"One person died after being taken to hospital and 43 have been
treated for injuries sustained in the violence," Tallinn police
chief Raivo Kuut said on Estonian Television.


More than 300 people were detained following the violence which
was the worst the Baltic state has seen since restoring
independence from Moscow in 1991.
