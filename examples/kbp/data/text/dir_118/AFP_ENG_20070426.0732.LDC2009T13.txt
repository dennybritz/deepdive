The US Congress' vote to push for the withdrawal of troops from
Iraq was wrong and will bring comfort to Al-Qaeda insurgents,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Friday.


The Democrat-dominated US Senate on Thursday passed legislation
which set a timeline for the recall of US troops from Iraq, where
the US has been engaged in a bloody war since March 2003.


US President George W Bush has vowed to veto the law.


Howard, a staunch Bush supporter who has also committed troops to
Iraq and Afghanistan, said the vote by the US Congress was
"probably not helpful to the general situation in Iraq."


"I think it is wrong, and I don't think it is doing anything
other than giving great comfort and encouragement to Al-Qaeda and
the insurgency in Iraq," Howard said.


"They are looking at all this, they read newspapers, they see it
on television and they say, 'The American domestic resolve is
weakening, therefore we should maintain our resolve.'


"If there is a perception of an America defeat in Iraq, that will
leave the whole of the Middle East in great turmoil and will be
an enormous victory for terrorism."


The US bill, passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday,
comes against the background of plunging public support for the
war which has claimed the lives of more than 3,300 US servicemen
and women.
