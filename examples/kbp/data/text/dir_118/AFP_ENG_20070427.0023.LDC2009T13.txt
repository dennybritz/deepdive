Hong Kong share prices finished the Friday morning session 0.76
percent lower as investors locked in profits amid worries that
China may announce further economic-tightening measures during
the long Labor Day holiday next week, dealers said.


They said there was also some selling activity linked to the
expiry of April futures contracts Friday.


Midsize lender China CITIC Bank posted strong gains on its debut
but it lagged its A-share gains on the mainland.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning down 157.09 points at
20,510.20, off a low of 20,425.57 and a high of 20,619.11.


China CITIC Bank was at 6.81 Hong Kong dollars (87 US cents), up
16.2 percent from the IPO price of 5.86 dollars. It opened at
7.08 dollars.


The H-share gains paled in comparison with the bank's A-shares
which ended the morning session in Shanghai at 11.58 yuan (1.50
US dollars), nearly double the mainland offer price of 5.8 yuan.
