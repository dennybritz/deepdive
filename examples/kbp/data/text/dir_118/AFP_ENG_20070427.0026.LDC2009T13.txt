Police raided a house owned by Atlanta Falcons quarterback
Michael Vick and discovered an alleged dog fighting operation,
ABC television reported on Thursday.


The report said the raid was part of a drug probe by law
enforcement officials.


More than 60 dogs - some injured or malnourished - as well as
other items associated with the activity were found in the three
buildings on the property in Smithfield, Virginia.


Vick does not live on the property, the report said, but his
relative Davon Boddie does.


Boddie was arrested by Hampton, Virginia police outside a
nightclub on Friday on charges of distribution of marijuana and
possession with intent to sell - sparking the raid.


However, the superstar signal-caller, who owns the property, was
not present when police arrived at the house on Wednesday.
