Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa has expelled the World Bank
representative from his country, accusing the institution of
attempting to blackmail him while he was economy minister in
2005, an official said Thursday.


An official letter of Correa's decision to throw out World Bank
official Eduardo Somensatto will be released by the foreign
ministry, said a senior economy ministry official who requested
anonymity.


The leftist president, in office since January, has charged that
the global development lender suspended a 100 million dollar loan
for Ecuador in 2005 in retaliation for his reforms of the
country's oil sector.
