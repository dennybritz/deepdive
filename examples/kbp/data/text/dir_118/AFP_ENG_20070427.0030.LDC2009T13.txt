The Bank of Japan on Friday left its key interest rate unchanged
at 0.5 percent for the third meeting in a row as expected against
a backdrop of lingering deflationary pressures.


The nine-member board voted unanimously to hold the overnight
call rate steady, the Bank of Japan said in a brief statement
after a one-day meeting.


The decision came just hours after the government said Japan's
core consumer prices fell by a bigger-than-expected 0.3 percent
in March, down for a second straight month.


The central bank last raised interest rates in February, by a
quarter point, which was the first increase since July when the
BoJ ended more than five years of virtually free credit.


BoJ governor Toshihiko Fukui has said he hopes to keep raising
interest rates gradually but he faces political resistance to
further monetary tightening.


Dealers said the market was now waiting for remarks from Fukui at
a news conference later Tuesday as well as the central bank's
latest forecasts for economic growth and inflation in its outlook
report.
