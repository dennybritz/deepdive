China announced Friday that Li Zhaoxing has been replaced as
foreign minister by Yang Jiechi, one of his deputies who is a
former ambassador to Washington.


The official Xinhua news agency indicated that Li's retirement
was due to his age. He is 66, and ministers usually retire at
age, it said.


"China's top legislature has approved the cabinet nomination of
Yang Jiechi, former ambassador to the United States, as the
country's new foreign minister," it announced.


"Yang, 57, replaces Li Zhaoxing, 66, who has served as China's
top diplomat since 2003."


A specialist in American relations, Yang spent more than 12 years
in China's embassy in Washington, becoming ambassador to the
United States from 2001 until 2005, when he returned to China as
a vice foreign minister under Li.


A native of Shanghai, Yang was born in 1950 and studied at Bath
University and the London School of Economics in Britain in the
1970s.


Li was born in 1940 and has been with China's foreign ministry
since the mid- 1960s. He had also been an ambassador to the
United States before becoming foreign minister.
