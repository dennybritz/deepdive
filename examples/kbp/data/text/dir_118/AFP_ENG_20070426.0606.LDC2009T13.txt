Cabin crew of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) have promised to
end a three- day strike which led to the cancellation of 685
flights in and out of Copenhagen, the company said Thursday.


The cabin staff had walked off the job earlier in the week in
what the Danish labour court ruled to be an illegal strike to
protest against alleged poor working conditions.


They informed the management they would return to work on Friday,
according to an SAS spokesman.


"We are happy that they have decided to resume work because the
last three days have been punishing for our customers and we
profusely regret this," Jens Langergaard, a spokesman for SAS-
Denmark, told AFP.


SAS was already hit last month by a similar strike after the
airline failed to reach a collective agreement with the
1,600-member Cabin Attendants Union.


Union chair Verner Lundtoft Hansen told Danish news agency Ritzau
on Wednesday: "We are protesting against poor working conditions.
Staff want to be able to influence the planning of holidays and
days off."
