Japan's unemployment rate held steady at 4.0 percent in March,
unchanged for a fifth straight month, official data showed
Friday.


The total number of unemployed dipped by 80,000 from a year
earlier to 2.81 million in March, the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications said.


The unemployment rate is watched closely for evidence of expanded
hiring by Japanese companies and positive knock-on effects for
consumer spending.
