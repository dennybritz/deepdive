Lawyers for war-on-terror detainees at the US naval base in
Guantanamo, Cuba, late Wednesday asked the US Supreme Court to
stop a government bid to further curb their contacts with their
clients, a court source said.


In February, the federal appeals court in the US capital rejected
a suit filed by dozens of prisoners challenging their open-ended
detention on the US naval base, located on Cuba's southeastern
tip.


The Supreme Court declined to take up the case on April 2, saying
the detainees still had other venues for their complaint.


That left intact a district court ruling that the inmates had no
constitutional right to challenge their detention before federal
courts because they were not US citizens or on US soil.


The Justice Department earlier filed a request in the same
federal appeals court calling for a judge to approve strict
limits on the number of visits lawyers can have with their
clients, and allowing other restrictions such as letting
intelligence officers review lawyer-client mail.


"Absent suspension of the order," reads the request by a team of
lawyers representing dozens of detainees, the court "will be free
to grant the government's motion . . . (thus) inflicting
irreparable harm upon petitioners.


"The government -- which maintains that the Guantanamo detainees
have no legal rights whatsoever -- will completely control the
terms and conditions of communications between petitioners and
their counsel," the lawyers wrote.
