US and Japanese diplomatic and military leaders will hold talks
next week on issues of mutual interest, the State Department said
late Thursday.


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, US Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates and their Japanese counterparts, Foreign Minister
Taro Aso and Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma, will meet in
Washington Tuesday, the State Department said in a statement.


The meeting of the US-Japan Security Consultative Committee will
be the first in Washington since May 5, 2006.


The so-called 2+2 ministerial follows a summit between Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President George W. Bush in the US
capital, which got under way Thursday. The two leaders were
expected to discuss North Korea and Tokyo's expanding global
role.
