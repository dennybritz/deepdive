Japan's consumer prices fell for a second straight month in March
as the economy struggles to exit deflation, while industrial
output dropped unexpectedly, official figures showed Friday.


Japan's core consumer prices fell by 0.3 percent last month from
a year earlier, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications said.


The core consumer price index (CPI) for Tokyo alone in April --
seen as a leading indicator for national price trends -- was
steady from a year earlier.


February's drop in Japan's core consumer prices was the first for
10 months.


With the economy struggling to shake off deflation, the Bank of
Japan is expected to leave its interest rates unchanged at 0.5
percent for a third meeting in a row later Friday.


Japan's unemployment rate held steady at 4.0 percent in March,
unchanged for a fifth straight month, separate data showed.


The total number of unemployed dipped by 80,000 from a year
earlier to 2.81 million in March, the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications said.


Industrial output meanwhile fell by 0.6 percent in March from the
previous month, defying market expectations for an increase.


Average market expectations had been for a gain of 0.9 percent
after February's 0.7 percent increase.


However, year-on-year output was up 1.6 percent in March,
according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which
said production was still on "a gradual, raising trend."
