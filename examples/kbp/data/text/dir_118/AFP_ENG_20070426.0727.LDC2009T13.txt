China CITIC Bank, the nation's seventh largest bank, jumped 55
percent on its trading debut in Shanghai Friday after the year's
largest initial public offering so far, dealers said.


The stock on the Shanghai bourse hit 9.00 yuan (1.16 dollars) in
early trade, well above expectations for a range of 6.50 to 8.0
yuan.


CITIC Bank said it raised net proceeds of 13.06 billion yuan from
its IPO in Shanghai and about 27.62 billion Hong Kong dollars
(3.54 billion US) from a Hong Kong sale.


The lender, which is also listing in Hong Kong Friday, sold 2.302
billion A-shares in Shanghai at 5.8 yuan per share and 4.885
billion H-shares in Hong Kong at 5.86 Hong Kong dollars each.


The dual listing comes as the authorities encourage China's major
firms to list for preference at home so as to help soak up
abundant liquidity and provide a steady a market which has soared
more than 200 percent since the beginning of 2006.


The bank plans to use the proceeds to expand its capital base.
