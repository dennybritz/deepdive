Police here late Thursday violently dispersed a meeting of
opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko who were
demonstrating against the building of a nuclear power station,
arresting a dozen people.


Several thousand people, mostly young, had gathered to mark the
21st anniversary of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl and express
their opposition to the planned construction of a first nuclear
power station in Belarus proposed recently by Lukashenko.


After most of the demonstrators had dispersed, riot police hit
and kicked those who remained, forcing a dozen into a bus with
blacked-out windows.


The authoritarian president had expressed the wish earlier this
month to build a first nuclear power plant, possibly with Russian
help.


This former Soviet state bordering on Ukraine was heavily
contaminated by the Chernobyl explosion on April 26, 1986.
