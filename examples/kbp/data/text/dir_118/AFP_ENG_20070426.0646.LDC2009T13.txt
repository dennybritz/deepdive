Citigroup has succeeded in its massive takeover offer for
scandal-hit Japanese securities firm Nikko Cordial despite
resistance among some major shareholders, the two firms announced
Friday.


The US financial giant has raised its stake in the Japanese firm
to 61.08 percent from 56.15 percent through a tender offer of
1,700 yen per share that closed on Thursday, a statement said.
