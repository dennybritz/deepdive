A Russian captain who raced back to Russia with two Norwegian
inspectors on board after being caught fishing in disputed waters
was found not guilty of kidnapping them by a Russian court on
Thursday.


Valery Yarantsev led Norwegian coast guards on a high-speed chase
for five days through Arctic waters in October 2005 when he
defied a Norwegian arrest order and set his trawler on course for
the northern Russian city of Murmansk.


The two Norwegian fishing inspectors who boarded his vessel, the
Elektron, at the start of the incident, remained on board and
were eventually returned to Norway by the Russian authorities.


The fishing captain has become something of a local hero in the
fishing port of Murmansk, where there is widespread resentment
against Norway for stepping up checks on Russian boats.


The court in Murmansk found Yarantsev not guilty of holding the
inspectors against their will but guilty on the lesser charge of
poaching and fined 3,900 dollars (2,900 euros), Russian news
agencies reported.
