Legendary former Hollywood lobbyist and presidential aide Jack
Valenti has died, the Motion Picture Association of America
(MPAA) said in a statement on Thursday.


Valenti, 85, died in Washington, the MPAA said, a day after
checking out of a hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, where he had
been hospitalized last month for treatment following a stroke,
according to reports.


The MPAA statement did not give details on Valenti's cause of
death.


The former World War II bomber pilot was best known for four
decades spent defending the interests of Hollywood's movie
system, playing a leading role in the formation of copyright
protection and antipiracy laws.


He was also credited with establishing a ratings systems for US
films that replaced a much-reviled censorship board.


"Jack Valenti was a giant who loomed large over two of the
world's most glittering stages -- Washington and Hollywood," MPAA
chairman and CEO Dan Glickman said in a statement.


"The entire MPAA community is deeply saddened by the news that we
have lost Jack. Our thoughts and prayers are with Mary Margaret,
with their three children ... and with the rest of the Valenti
family."
