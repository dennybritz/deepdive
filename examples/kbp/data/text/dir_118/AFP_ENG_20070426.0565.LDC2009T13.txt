The United States has transferred two more "war on terror"
detainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to their home countries, the
Pentagon said Thursday.


One unidentified detainee was taken to Afghanistan and the other
to Morocco, a Pentagon statement said.


Some eighty other detainees have been determined to be fit to be
transferred or released from Guantanamo, but are awaiting action
by the State Department, which must negotiate their repatriation
with home countries.


With the latest transfers, about 380 detainees remain at
Guantanamo.
