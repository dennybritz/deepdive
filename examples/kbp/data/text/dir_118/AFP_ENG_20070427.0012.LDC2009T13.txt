Two members of a leftist peasant group were shot dead and three
others wounded in the southern Philippines, police and leftist
spokesmen said Friday.


The five men, riding a modified motorcycle, were fired on as they
passed through a Philippine Army checkpoint in New Bataan town in
the southern island of Mindanao on Wednesday.


Soldiers were tipped off about plans by communist New People's
Army (NPA) guerrillas to infiltrate the area, and shot the five
when they refused to stop for inspection, provincial police
director Nestor Quinsay said.


The leftist Brotherhood of Filipino Farmers (KMP) said in a
statement that all five men were members of their group and
accused the military of deliberately targeting them.


Quinsay said he did not know if the dead and wounded men were
affiliated with any group. The soldiers involved in the incident
have been restricted to their camp while an investigation is
going on.


Local rights groups say more than 800 people have been murdered
for political reasons since President Gloria Arroyo took office
in 2001.


Two months ago, a UN special rapporteur also blamed the military
for the killings, and said they remained in "almost total
denial."
