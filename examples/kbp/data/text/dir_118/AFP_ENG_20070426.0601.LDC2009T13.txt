Microsoft Corp. reported on Thursday that its profits soared to a
record high in the first three months of the year due to sales of
its new Vista operating system and Outlook software.


Profit in the quarter ending March 31 was 4.43 billion dollars,
or 50 cents per share, as compared to 29 cents per share, or 2.98
billion dollars, in the same period in 2006.


"I am extremely pleased that we delivered a quarter of strong
double-digit growth for revenue, operating income and EPS
(earnings per share)," said Microsoft chief financial officer
Chris Liddell.


"And I am looking forward to a very good finish to this fiscal
year with strength continuing into fiscal 2008."


The Redmond, Washington-based software colossus credited the
success of its heavily-promoted new Vista operating system and
related software for what it declared a record-breaking quarter.


Revenues at the world's largest software company tallied 14.4
billion dollars in the quarter as compared to 10.9 billion during
the same three months last year.
