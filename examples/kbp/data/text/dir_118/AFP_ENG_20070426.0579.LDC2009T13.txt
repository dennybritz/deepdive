Namibia could become Singapore's gateway to southern Africa if it
takes advantage of export incentives, Namibian President
Hifikepunye Pohamba told his counterpart from the city state
Thursday.


"The Namibian government has introduced generous investment
packages for manufacturers and exporters," Pohamba said as
Singaore's President S. R. Nathan began a three-day state visit
after a trip to South Africa.


"We have a tax free incentive for exports made from Namibia's
export processing zones."


Pohamba said that bilateral agreements on taxation and aviation
would serve to bring the two countries closer together.


For his part, Nathan said he was aware Namibia was seeking
assistance from Singapore to establish a fish-feed plant for the
African country's expanding fishing industry and wanted Singapore
to send experts to train Namibians in the management of its two
ports, Walvis Bay and Luederitz.


"We will consider your government's requests," Nathan said at the
start of the official talks.


A small business delegation from Singapore, which is accompanying
Nathan, held separate talks with the Namibian business sector.
