Japan's core consumer prices fell by 0.3 percent in March from a
year earlier, declining for a second straight month as the
economy struggles to exit deflation, official figures showed
Friday.


The core consumer price index (CPI) for Tokyo alone in April --
seen as a leading indicator for national price trends -- was
steady from a year earlier, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications said.


February's drop in Japan's core consumer prices was the first for
10 months.
