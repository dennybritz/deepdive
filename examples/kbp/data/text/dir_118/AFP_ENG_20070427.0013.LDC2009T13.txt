Five Americans have been expelled from China after staging an
illegal demonstration at Mount Everest base camp aimed at
"splitting" the country, the Chinese foreign ministry said
Friday.


"Upon discovering this activity, China's public security bureau
stopped the protest and according to... relevant laws expelled
these people outside of China," a ministry spokesman told AFP.


The Americans on Wednesday unfurled banners demanding a "free
Tibet" and protested against plans to take the Olympic torch to
the top of the mountain ahead of the 2008 Beijing Games,
according to Students for a Free Tibet.
