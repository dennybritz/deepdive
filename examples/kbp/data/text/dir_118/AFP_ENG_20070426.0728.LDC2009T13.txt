Japanese share prices fell 0.40 percent in morning trade Friday
after soft domestic economic data and amid caution in the midst
of the corporate earnings season, dealers said.


They said the market succumbed to profit-taking after Thursday's
strong gains triggered by Wall Street's record close.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares was
down 69.17 points at 17,360.0 by the lunch break.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares had more
modest losses, falling 2.01 points or 0.12 percent to 1,701.40 to
hold just above the symbolic 1,700-point level.
