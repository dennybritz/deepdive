Greek coast guard units on Friday were looking for a man and a
baby, both clandestine immigrants, believed missing at sea after
a group of nine migrants was found stranded on the small southern
Aegean island of Farmakonisi, the merchant marine ministry said.


Six men and two women of undisclosed nationality were found on
the island, along with a child that had already drowned, the
ministry said.


Three coast guard patrol boats and a helicopter were
participating in the search.


Initial reports said the migrants were brought near the island by
people- smugglers and attempted to swim to its shores.


Farmakonisi is a short distance from the coast of Turkey.


Greece lies on a major people-smuggling route to Western Europe,
and intercepts dozens of clandestine migrants trying to enter the
country by land and sea every month.
