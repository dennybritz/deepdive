Researchers have identified a new mechanism that provokes
resistance to certain lung cancer drugs, which may exist in other
types of cancerous tumors, according to a study published
Thursday in the United States.


The international team of scientists, in a report to appear in
the April 27 issue of the journal Science and released online in
advance, said their findings suggest a treatment strategy for
patients with the resistant tumors.


The mechanism was discovered in about 20 percent of patients with
tumors that became resistant to Tarceva or Iressa, two commonly
used targeted therapy drugs in the United States, said Jeffrey
Engelman of Massachusetts General Hospital, the paper's lead
author.


The resistance was "caused by the genetic activation of an
oncogene that is not the normal target of the drug, which is
something that has never been seen before," Engelman said.


Tarceva (eriotinib) and Iressa (gefitinib) are used to treat
advanced types of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths
in the United States.


"We also identified a potential new way to treat these resistant
tumors with combination therapy directed against both protein
targets," said Pasi Jaenne of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston, Massachusetts, the study's senior author.


The drugs act by blocking a growth factor receptor, a molecule on
the surface of cancer cells.
