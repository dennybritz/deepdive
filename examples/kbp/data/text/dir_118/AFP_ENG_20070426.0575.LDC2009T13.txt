Czech Republic former international midfielder Karel Poborsky
will rejoin the national team as its technical manager, the Czech
and Moravian Football Federation announced on Thursday.


Poborsky will take up the new post for the friendly against
Austria in August but will join the group to help the team's
preparations for the Euro-2008 qualification group game against
Wales on June 2, the federation added.


"I am delighted with the offer and have accepted it gladly," said
Poborsky, who is still playing top Czech league football for
Ceske Budejovice, where he is also general manager and executive
president.


The former Manchester United and Lazio Rome star retired from the
Czech international team in July last year after its
disappointing exit from the last World Cup at the group stage.


The current Czech squad has been slammed recently following a
home defeat against Germany, an unconvincing 1-0 win against
Cyprus and revelations that top players took part in a late night
binge between the two games.


Poborsky won his first cap in 1994 and helped the Czech Republic
to reach the final of Euro 96, where they were beaten by Germany.
