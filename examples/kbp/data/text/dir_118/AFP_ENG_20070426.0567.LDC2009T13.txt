Lebanon will compensate Denmark for damage to its consulate in
Beirut that occurred during riots over a Danish paper's
publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed, the
Danish government said Thursday.


The Lebanese will provide 700,0000 kronor (94,000 euros, 128,000
dollars) in compensation, the Danish foreign ministry said in a
statement.


Protesters vandalised the consulate and the Danish embassy in
Damascus and set fire to the buildings in February 2006 following
the publication of the cartoons, deemed offensive by Muslims, in
Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. The cartoons were later
reproduced in other European newspapers.


The foreign ministry said it hoped to finalise a compensation
agreement with the Syrian government soon.
