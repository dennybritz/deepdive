Citigroup has succeeded in its massive takeover offer for
scandal-hit Japanese securities firm Nikko Cordial despite
resistance among some major shareholders, the two firms announced
Friday.


The US financial giant has raised its stake in the Japanese firm
to 61.08 percent from 56.15 percent through a tender offer of
1,700 yen per share that closed on Thursday, a statement said.


Citigroup raised its bid to a total of 13.4 billion dollars last
month in an effort to win over sceptical shareholders.


Nikko Cordial admitted last December to having falsified its
financial statements for the fiscal years that ended in March
2005 and March 2006.


A panel of outside experts tapped by Nikko reported in January
that former executives had been "actively involved" in the
systematic violation of laws and had inflated profits for the
year to March 2005.


Japan's financial authority imposed its largest-ever fine on
Nikko Cordial in early January for issuing the false earnings
report.
