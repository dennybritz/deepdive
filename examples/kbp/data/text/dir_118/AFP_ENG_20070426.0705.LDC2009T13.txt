A mother and her five-year-old son walked for about 16 hours
through Guyana's jungle after surviving a small-plane crash that
may have killed three others, authorities said Thursday.


The mother reported, however, that a baby, a woman and the pilot
appeared to have died Wednesday when the twin-engine Britten
Norman Islander airplane crashed, said Fazel Khan general manager
of domestic airline Air Services Limited.


The mother, Berenice Perreira, and her son walked from the crash
site to the village of Kopenang. It takes less than 30 minutes
from Kato to Kopenang by air across the Amazon jungle and
mountainous area.


Guyana has requested two Brazilian air force helicopters to
assist the rescue operations.


"The search will continue until the wreck is found and the
persons aboard would have been brought out dead or alive," Khan
told AFP.


Guyana Defense Force Chief of Staff, Colonel Lawrence Paul, said
Brazil was asked to provide two helicopters to aid in the search
and rescue operations. The Brazilian embassy here said the
request would most likely be favorably considered.


The Guyana Defense Force's only helicopter is not working, but
two army planes and a private aircraft are being used in the
search mission along with civilians and soldiers on the ground.
