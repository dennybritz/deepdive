International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed
admitted on Thursday that the 2007 World Cup, which lasts for a
marathon seven weeks, is too long.


The World Cup, which reaches a conclusion with the final between
champions Australia and Sri Lanka here on Saturday, staged its
first competitive match on March 13 when West Indies played
Pakistan in Kingston.


But warm-up games were being played as early as March 5.


"We listen to criticism, and there has been a lot of it from
people saying it's been too long - so we'll look to make it
shorter," Speed told the BBC.


"We'll seek to reduce this 47-day World Cup by seven or 10 days,
and hopefully we'll get it down to somewhere between five and six
weeks next time."
