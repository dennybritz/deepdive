UN chief Ban Ki-moon has named former Portuguese president Jorge
Sampaio as high representative for civilizations, a new post
aimed at easing tensions between societies, a UN spokeswoman said
Thursday.


Sampaio, president of Portugal from January 1996 to January 2006,
will be the High Representative for the Alliance of
Civilizations, an initiative launched by Spain at the United
Nations in 2004.


"The High Representative will provide the vision and leadership
required, especially to promote the Alliance of Civilizations as
a credible and viable attempt to diminish the dangerous tensions
between diverse societies and their threat to international
stability," Ban's spokeswoman, Michele Montas, said in a
statement.


The Alliance of Civilizations, backed by Turkey and former UN
chief Kofi Annan, seeks to bring together institutions and civil
society to bridge prejudices and misunderstandings between
peoples of different cultures and religions.
