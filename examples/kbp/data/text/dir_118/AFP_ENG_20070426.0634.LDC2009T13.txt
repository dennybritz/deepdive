Miss America has joined New York area police in the fight against
pedophiles who prey on underaged girls, acting as bait in a sting
operation that has so far yielded 11 suspects, police said
Thursday.


Blonde beauty Lauren Nelson, 20, a former Miss Teen Oklahoma,
loaned police photographs of herself as a teenager and posed as a
teenaged girl to lure would- be child predators cruising the
Internet for sex with minors.


Four men had sexually explicit chats online with police officers
posing as 13- and 14-year-old girls using Nelson's photographs
and turned up for a rendezvous at a house rigged with television
cameras.


Instead of meeting their underaged prey, the four were met by
Nelson and a group of police officers.


Seven others had also been arrested in the ongoing operation,
though they had not turned up at the house, Detective Sergeant
John Cowie of New York state's Suffolk County Computer Crimes
unit told AFP.


The 11 were all charged with disseminating indecent material to a
minor and face up to four years in jail if convicted. "The crime
is in the chat, the illegal chat of an extremely sexually graphic
nature," he said.


The sting operation will be shown on US reality television show
"America's Most Wanted" this weekend.


The Miss America organization said Nelson became passionate about
the issue of child Internet safety after she and two friends were
approached by an online predator when she was 13.
