Japan on Friday hanged three inmates in its first executions this
year, the justice ministry said.


"Three inmates were executed today," a justice ministry spokesman
said.


In line with standard procedure, he declined to disclose details
including the names of those who were executed.


Japan is the only major industrialised nation other than the
United States to practice the death penalty.


Japan last carried out executions on Christmas Day last year when
it hanged four prisoners after a gap of 15 months due to a
previous justice minister's opposition to the death penalty.
