The opinion poll lead held by the main opposition Conservatives
over the governing Labour Party has narrowed, a survey published
on Friday showed.


According to the YouGov poll in The Daily Telegraph, however, the
Conservatives' lead widened when voters were posed with the
choice of a government led by opposition leader David Cameron, or
finance minister Gordon Brown, the favourite to succeed Prime
Minister Tony Blair.


Support for the Conservatives dropped two percentage points to 37
percent, while Labour held steady at 32 percent compared to a
similar poll last month. The smaller opposition Liberal Democrats
gained one point to 18 percent.


Asked to choose between a Cameron-led government or one with
Brown as prime minister, though, 45 percent of voters picked the
former, while 35 percent opted for the latter.


Some 30 percent also thought Cameron would make the best prime
minister, as compared to 25 percent who chose Brown, though 38
percent -- a plurality -- said they did not know.


The poll comes less than a week before elections for some local
councils across England, as well as the Scottish and Welsh
regional assemblies on May 3, where Labour is expected to fare
poorly.
