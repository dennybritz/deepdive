Five of eight Democratic presidential hopefuls admitted during a
televised debate Thursday that they have or have kept a gun at
home.


The moderator of the debate asked that candidates who owned
firearms to raise their hands, but the three favorites in opinion
polls did not: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards.


"How many of you, in your adult lifetime, have had a gun in the
house?" moderator Brian Williams, an NBC News journalist, asked.


After a few seconds' pause, Chris Dodd, Dennis Kucinich and Mike
Gravel raised their hands. Joe Biden clarified that he had owned
a shotgun, not a pistol, and Bill Richardson defended his record
as the National Rifle Association's favorite candidate of either
party, saying: "I'm a Westerner. I'm a governor of New Mexico."
