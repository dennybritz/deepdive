The Estonian authorities during overnight violence in which one
person died moved a Soviet war monument from its spot in central
Tallinn to a secret location, officials said Friday.


"The aim of the government move was to prevent further similar
gross violations of public order, which pose a real threat to
citizens' health and property," the government press office said
in a statement.


One person died and at least 43 were injured in central Tallinn
in an overnight looting rampage and clashes with police after a
protest near the spot where the statue of a Soviet Red Army
soldier had stood.
