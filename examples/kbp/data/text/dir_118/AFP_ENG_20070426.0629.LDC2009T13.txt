Akili Smith, a bust after being picked third overall in the 1999
National Football League draft, signed Thursday with the Calgary
Stampeders of the Canadian Football League.


Terms of the deal were not disclosed.


Smith was picked by the Cincinnati Bengals third overall after
quarterbacks Tim Couch and Donovan McNabb were selected in the
1999 draft.


The 31-year-old American never lived up to his billing and was
released by the Bengals back in 2003.


Smith started 17 of 22 games for the Bengals and completed less
than 47 percent of his passes (215-of-461) for 2,212 yards and
just five touchdowns with 13 interceptions.


Smith later signed with the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, but did not play in a game for either team.


The Stampeders on Thursday also signed two other former NFL
players - defensive end Alonzo Jackson and linebacker Matt


Grootegoed.
