Charles, the Prince of Wales, will not attend the concert marking
10 years since the death of his ex wife Diana, the Princess of
Wales, a spokesman for the royal told The Times in an article
published Friday.


The giant July 1 concert at London's new Wembley Stadium will
feature performances by Elton John, Status Quo, and Rod Stewart,
as well as US rapper Kanye West, and British singers James
Morrison, Natasha Bedingfield and Lily Allen.


It was the brainchild of Diana's two sons, Princes William and
Harry.


"The concert is really for the younger generation to enjoy," the
prince's spokesman was quoted as saying by The Times, confirming
that neither Charles nor his second wife Camilla, the Duchess of
Cornwall, would attend.


"There will be a memorial service for Diana on August 31, which
will be an event for all generations of the Windsors to come
together."


Diana married Charles, the heir to the throne, in 1981 and was a
hugely popular member of Britain's royal family. The couple
separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.


Diana was killed in a Paris car crash in August 1997 along with
her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and his chauffeur Henri Paul.
