The 1998 champion john higgins won his first round encounter
against qualifier Michael Holt by an identical 10-4 scoreline.


Higgins laboured to a 6-3 lead in the opening session, returning
in more vibrant form to seal the tie and set up a second round
date with Ireland's Fergal O'Brien.


Higgins had the chance of a 147 in the last frame of the first
session, but broke down on 104 - the highest break of the match
by some way.


The Scot said luck played a big part in his victory.


"It was a very nervy match - Michael had a lot of chances he
should have taken because he was hitting the ball quite nicely at
the start," Higgins told the BBC.


"I could have been behind going into this last session because I
didn't play well at all. I was lucky to be 6-3 up."


He added: "The conditions didn't help, with the table playing
very badly. But I am just delighted to win.


"A lot of very good players have already left the tournament.
Hopefully, I can try to get some momentum going now. You can't do
that if you are back up the road.


"I've got Fergal next and that will be another tough one. He had
a great win over Barry Hawkins."
