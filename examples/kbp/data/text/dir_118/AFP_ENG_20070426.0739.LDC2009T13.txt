Hong Kong share prices opened 0.53 percent lower Friday as
investors locked in profits amid concerns that China may announce
further economic-tightening measures during the upcoming Labour
Day holiday, dealers said.


They said trading was also cautious due to the expiry of the
April futures contracts later Friday while reports of unease at
China's National Social Security Fund, a major institutional
investor, over unprecedented gains in the mainland stockmarkets
may have added to the negative tone.


The Hang Seng Index opened down 110.22 points at 20,557.07.


CITIC Bank, China's seventh largest bank, saw its H-shares open
at 7.08 dollars (90 US cents), up 20.8 percent from the offer
price of 5.86 dollars but well short of the 55 percent gain seen
in its parallel Shanghai listing.
