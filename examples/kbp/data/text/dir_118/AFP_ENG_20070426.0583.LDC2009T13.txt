US blue-chip shares extended their record streak Thursday as
bullish investors propelled the leading Dow Jones Industrial
Average share index to yet another all-time high.


The blue chip share gauge maintained momentum above the
psychologically important 13,000-point mark on the back of a
flurry of fat profit reports, including ExxonMobil's latest
earnings.


The Dow rose 15.77 points (0.12 percent) to 13,105.66 just after
the closing bell.


The Nasdaq composite had gained 6.57 points (0.26 percent) to
2,554.46, but the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index
finished down 1.14 points (0.08 percent) at a preliminary close
of 1,494.28.
