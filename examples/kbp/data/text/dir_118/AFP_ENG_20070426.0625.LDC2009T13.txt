President Rafael Correa has expelled the World Bank's
representative from Ecuador, accusing the institution of
attempting to extort him when he was economy minister in 2005, an
official said Thursday.


An official letter of Correa's decision to throw out World Bank
official Eduardo Somensatto of Brazil will be released by the
foreign ministry, said a senior economy ministry official who
requested anonymity.


The leftist president, in office since January, has charged that
the global development lender suspended a 100-million-dollar loan
for Ecuador in 2005 in retaliation for his reform of the
country's oil sector.


"We will act appropriately in this case, not only by expelling
the World Bank representative in the country but also by taking
the appropriate international legal measures, because we are no
one's colony," Correa, an economist by training, said April 21.


Foreign Minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa was expected to address
the issue, official sources told AFP.


The World Bank office spokeswoman in Quito, Paola Vallejo,
declined to comment on the row, as did the World Bank's
Washington headquarters.
