A controversial plan to build a freeway through virgin forest in
northeast Poland hit a roadblock Thursday when a court cancelled
its construction permit, the PAP news agency reported.


The project in the Rospuda Valley, near the border with
Lithuania, had been hotly contested by the European Commission,
which was threatening to go ahead with a suit lodged at the
European Court of Justice.


Environmental groups such as Greenpeace also staged
demonstrations earlier this year to protest the road, which they
said would destroy the area's fragile ecosystem.


Thursday's verdict by the administrative tribunal means Poland's
environment ministry, which had given the go-ahead for
construction, will now have to consider the more costly option of
digging a tunnel for part of the freeway.


The road was being sought by the 17,000 inhabitants of the town
of Augustow, who want the thousands of noisy trucks which
currently pass by their homes to use the freeway bypass.


The planned stretch of highway is part of a corridor called the
Via Baltica, a major roadlink opening the way to increased trade
between the Baltic states and the rest of the European Union.
