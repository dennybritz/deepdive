Japan's industrial output fell by 0.6 percent in March from the
previous month, defying market expectations for an increase,
official data showed Friday.


Average market expectations had been for a gain of 0.9 percent
after February's 0.7 percent increase.


However, year-on-year output was up 1.6 percent in March,
according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which
said production was still on "a gradual, raising trend."
