Torrential rains whipped across southern China, leaving four dead
and causing economic losses of almost 243 million yuan (32
million dollars), state press reported Friday.


The heavy rains and gales tore down about 1,800 houses and
damaged more than 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of farmland in
Guangdong province and is expected to continue over the coming
days, the China Daily said, citing the provincial government.


The rainstorms hit most parts of Guangdong from Monday morning
until mid-day Tuesday with precipitation of more than 50
millimetres (two inches) recorded in 47 cities and towns,
seriously affecting more than 210,000 people, the report said.


The hardest hit areas of Lianshan, Heping and Longmen received
more than 100 millimetres per day, it added.
