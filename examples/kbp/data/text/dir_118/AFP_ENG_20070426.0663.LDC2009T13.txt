Hollywood megastar and paparazzi favorite Angelina Jolie lobbied
in Washington Thursday for the world's orphans and children at
risk.


Jolie enlivened the city of drab bureaucrats to inaugurate
headquarters for Global Action for Children, a non-partisan
advocacy group seeking more US government funding for programs
supporting orphans and vulnerable children around the world.


"The numbers associated with this problem are staggering," Jolie
said in a statement. "It is overwhelming and the scale of the
problem seems to give many an excuse for inaction.


"In many ways it is better to think of these children one by one,
each deserving of our care and attention, each being of equal
value and each being a test of whether justice  -- or injustice
-- will prevail," she said.


The United Nations estimates that 9.7 billion dollars are needed
each year to give "comprehensive care" and universal basic
education for orphans and vulnerable children around the world,
according to the group.


GAC is focused on increasing US government funding by 2.5 billion
dollars per year, up from the current 700 million dollars a year.


The group, founded in 2003, is supported by religious groups,
charities, student groups and non-governmental organizations.


Before the press conference Jolie -- a UN goodwill ambassador --
and GAC director Jennifer Delaney met with State Department
officials.
