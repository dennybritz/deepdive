China hopes to reverse a recent downturn in the services sector
as a share of the overall economy, the nation's top planning
agency said Thursday.


The service sector, which consumes relatively little energy, has
dropped from 40.7 percent of the gross domestic product in 2004
to 39.5 percent last year, the National Development and Reform
Commission told a briefing.


The commission aims to stop the decline and has set a target for
the service sector, also a major absorber of redundant labour, to
account for 42.9 percent of the overall economy by 2010, it said.


It said the decline, along with a corresponding rise in the share
of the manufacturing and construction, would result in a rise in
energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product.


This is in direct conflict with a five-year plan China has set
for itself to improve energy efficiency by 20 percent by the end
of the decade.


In an analysis of the economic performance so far this year, the
commission criticised local government for paying too little
attention to the service sector.


"Some local governments... pay too much attention to the
development of manufacturing industry, and in particular heavy
industry," said the analysis, posted on the commission's website
Thursday.


"Their policies do not provide sufficient support for the
development of service industries."
