German companies should shy away from "the short-term-ism of
Anglo-American corporate reporting," in favour of a more long-
term view, the country's finance minister said in an interview
published Thursday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, Peer Steinbrueck also described
the German economic revival as a "long-lasting recovery."


He told the business daily that the focus of a company should be
"how do I keep a company market-competitive in the medium term --
not the short-term profit maximisation."


In his view, Germany has to hang on to "the readiness of
companies to reach long-lasting decisions, and not to copy the
short-term-ism of Anglo-American corporate reporting."


Steinbrueck also told the FT that "this is a long-lasting
(economic) recovery."


"The fact is that Germany never became as bad as we ourselves saw
it, and we are now not as good as we need to be in the light of
globalisation and demographic trends."


Business confidence in Germany continued to climb in April, a
survey showed Wednesday, bolstering perceptions that the German
economy, the biggest in the 13-country eurozone, is booming.


The widely watched business climate index, calculated each month
by the Munich- based economic research institute Ifo, came as
Economy Minister Michael Glos raised the German economic growth
forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent -- a sharp rise on the previous
prediction of 1.7 percent.
