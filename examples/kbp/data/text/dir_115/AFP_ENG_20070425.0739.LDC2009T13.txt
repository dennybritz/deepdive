A firebomb seriously damaged the car of Uruguay's ambassador to
Greece overnight, police said Thursday.


The incendiary device, which was made up of several small gas
containers, exploded near the envoy's residence in Athens's
northern Nea Erythrea district.


An anti-terror unit of the Greek police was dispatched to the
scene to investigate the attack.


Police have attributed a series of firebomb attacks on banks,
public buildings and foreign interests in Athens and Greece's
second city Salonika to small groups of anarchists or extreme
leftists.
