World governing body FINA has refused to ratify Libby Lenton's
100 metre freestyle world record time of 52.99 achieved this
month, Swimming Australia said Thursday.


The time, swum by Lenton in the lead-off leg of a mixed 4x100m
freestyle relay in the Duel in the Pool here against the United
States was 0.31 seconds faster than German Britta Steffen's
existing world record.


But FINA Executive Director Cornel Marculescu said the race was
not recognised as it was a mixed event.


"Swimming Australia has no alternative but to accept this ruling
as there is no further course of action," Swimming Australia
chief executive Glenn Tasker said in a statement.


"It is an unfortunate situation and our hearts go out to Libby
and her coach Stephan Widmer because it was truly an amazing
performance from an amazing young Australian swimmer who I'm sure
will continue to aspire to lower the world mark."


Lenton said she was disappointed but remained positive as she
looks towards the future.


"I am a little disappointed because I know in my heart what time
I swam and that time is faster than the existing world record,"
she said.


"However, having said that, the disappointment can take nothing
away from the fact I now know I am capable of swimming under 53
seconds and I will continue to strive to improve every aspect of
my swimming."


Lenton won five gold medals at last month's world championships
im Melbourne.
