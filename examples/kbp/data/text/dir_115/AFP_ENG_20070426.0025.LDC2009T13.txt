Military-ruled Myanmar and communist North Korea signed an
agreement Thursday to restore diplomatic relations, Myanmar's
deputy foreign minister Kyaw Thu told reporters.


"This morning we signed an agreement to restore diplomatic ties,"
Kyaw Thu said after meeting with his North Korean counterpart,
Kim Yong-Il.


Myanmar severed ties with North Korea in 1983 after Pyongyang
organised a deadly bomb attack in a bid to assassinate South
Korea's then president Chun Doo Hwan, who was on an official
visit to Yangon.


But relations have warmed recently, with analysts saying that is
partly due to a perception that they have a common enemy in the
United States, which has branded both countries as "outposts of
tyranny."
