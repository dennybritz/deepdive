The Chinese mining giant Minmetals pledged to pursue its
operations in Latin America, particularly in the realm of copper
mining, the company's president said Wednesday.


"I think we will continue to invest strongly but I cannot say the
amount," said Zhang Shoulian at the World Economic Forum on Latin
America in Santiago.


The Chinese company is the world's largest buyer of metals and
has launched exploration projects in Peru and Bolivia.


In Chile, Minmetals has invested two billion dollars with Chile's
state-owned Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile (CODELCO),
the world's largest copper company.


In February, Minmetals signed a 550-million-dollar joint venture
deal in which CODELCO will supply China with copper -- 55.75
metric tonnes per year -- for the next 15 years.


Minmetals could also buy up to 25 percent of a new copper mine,
Gaby, which COLDECO plans to open in northern Chile in 2008.


The chief executive of Minmetals is co-chair of the WEF Latin
America forum, which just opened in Santiago, along with
Andronico Luksic Craig, vice-chair of Banco de Chile.


About 400 business leaders, politicians and regional experts are
gathering Wednesday and Thursday to discuss main risks and
benefits of investing in Latin America.
