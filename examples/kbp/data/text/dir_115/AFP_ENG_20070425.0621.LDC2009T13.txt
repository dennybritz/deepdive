Fans of the cult mockumentary "This is Spinal Tap" are in for a
treat.


The clueless heavy rockers, described in the 1984 spoof as "one
of England's loudest bands," are back, describing in a short film
to raise awareness about climate change what they've been doing
for the past 20-odd years.


Lead guitarists Nigel Tufnel and David St. Hubbins are also due
to make an appearance with bassist Derek Smalls at Wembley
Stadium in London on July 7 as part of the global Live Earth
concerts in aid of tackling climate change.


Director Rob Reiner, who played documentary maker Marty DiBergi
in the movie, told reporters in New York Wednesday he had been
asked to resurrect the band behind such classics as "Stonehenge,"
"Sex Farm" and "Hell Hole."


"I was asked... if I could contact Marty DiBergi," he said. "We
filmmakers have a bond, we stick together."


In the short movie, Reiner appears dressed as he was in the
opening sequence of the original film, saying: "I'm here today to
talk about something even more important than me or extremely
loud music."


The short goes on to interview the three main band members,
played by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer,
about what the band has been doing for the last two decades.


The short is one of a series being presented at New York's
Tribeca Film Festival to raise awareness about global warming.


"Tribeca's really setting itself apart by allowing film makers to
present an issue and use it as a platform," Reiner said.


The short film is due to posted at liveearth.msn.com, he added.
