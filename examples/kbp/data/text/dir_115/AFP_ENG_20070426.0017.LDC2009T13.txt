Hong Kong share prices ended the Thursday morning session 1.03
percent higher after the Dow Jones Industrial Average breached
the 13,000 points level for the first time overnight, dealers
said.


They said investors also cheered another firm showing on the
mainland's A-share markets.


The Hang Seng Index closed the morning up 212.23 points at
20,749.01, off a low of 20,651.29 and a high of 20,771.14.
