The Export-Import Bank of China, one of the country's three major
policy lenders, is in talks with the central government for a
possible capital injection, it said Thursday.


Exim Bank assistant president Zhu Xinqiang, who was speaking to
reporters on the sidelines of a shipping conference in Beijing,
declined to give a figure for how big the injection could be.


The Exim Bank was established in 1994 to finance mainly exports
of large machinery and electronics. The other two major policy
banks in the country are the China Development Bank and the
Agricultural Development Bank of China. Earlier media reports
said China Development Bank would likely receive a capital
injection in the form of foreign exchange from Central Huijin, an
investment arm of the central bank.


According to other reports, the investor could be a new foreign
exchange management agency that is currently being formed.


The move is part of reforms aimed at turning the state policy
banks into more commercialised entities, which China considers a
key task this year for the restructuring of the financial sector,
the reports said.


However, Zhu told reporters that Exim bank will not be completely
transformed into a commercial bank, noting that only some
commercial business, such as commercial loans, would be
introduced and only gradually.
