An order by Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko to hold
elections in two months is "unconstitutional," a senior aide to
Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych was quoted by Russian news
agency RIA Novosti as saying Wednesday.


"Both the previous decree to dissolve parliament and the decree
issued by the Ukrainian president (on Wednesday) are
unconstitutional," the agency quoted Yanukovych aide Sergei
Levochkin as saying.


Yushchenko said Wednesday that early parliamentary elections
would be held on June 24.
