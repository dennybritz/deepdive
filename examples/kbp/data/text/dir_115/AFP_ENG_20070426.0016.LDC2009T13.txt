China's Bank of Communications has drawn a record 1.45 trillion
yuan (188 billion dollars) in bookings for its initial public
offering in Shanghai, a state press said Thursday.


The Shanghai-based bank is likely to set the offering price at
7.9 yuan per share for the sale next month of 3.19 billion
A-shares, the official China Securities Journal said.


That would put the share price at the top end of the previously
announced 7.0-7.9 yuan range, and put the Hong Kong-listed lender
easily on track to earn more than three billion dollars.


The sizeable IPO is smaller than China CITIC Bank, which has
raised 5.4 billion dollars for its share sale in Shanghai and
Hong Kong that will begin trading Friday, marking the world's
biggest sale this year.


Bank of Communications, in which Britain's HSBC holds a 20
percent stake, will sell up to 957.1 million A-shares to
strategic investors and up to 797.58 million will go to the
institutional side.


It took in 1.155 trillion yuan in applications from institutional
investors and about 300 billion was generated from the retail
tranche.


Final pricing is expected to be announced later Thursday, the
paper said.
