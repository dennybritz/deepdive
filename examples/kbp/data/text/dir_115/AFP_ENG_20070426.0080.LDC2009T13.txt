A condom has been found in a children's happy meal sold at a
McDonald's outlet in New Zealand, alarming the grandparents of
the young girl it was bought for, a report said Thursday.


Rowan Hutch told The Dominion Post newspaper it was lucky his
wife was first to look in the small sports bag which came with
the meal they bought for their seven-year-old granddaughter Maia
Whitaker.


She was aghast when she found the green Durex condom, still in
its packet.


"I was pretty horrified really. The fact my granddaughter was
going to look in the bag and find this thing. It would be
difficult to explain, she's only seven," he said.


After demanding to see the manager, the meal was swapped for a
hamburger and a pencil case -- and McDonald's is investigating
the find.


A McDonald's spokeswoman said because of the popularity of the
previous happy meal gift which had sold out at the outlet in
Wellington, pre-packaged sports bags were substituted as
children's gifts.


One was left unsealed for display purposes and "somehow" it had
ended up with the customer.
