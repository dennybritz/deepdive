A majority of Americans believe victory in Iraq is no longer
possible and are siding with Democrats who want a timeline for
troop withdrawal from Iraq, a poll suggested Wednesday.


The results are a boost to Democrats who hold a majority in
Congress and who are locked in a standoff with President George
W. Bush over an Iraq and Afghanistan war spending bill that the
White House is pledging to veto.


According to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 56 percent
said they agreed with Democrats who want to set a deadline for
troop withdrawal, while 37 percent sided with Bush, who opposes
such a move.


In addition, 55 percent said "victory in Iraq is no longer
possible," while 36 percent took the contrary view.


Just 22 percent said they believed the United States was headed
in the right direction in general. The lowest point was 14
percent in July 2002, well before the March 2003 invasion of
Iraq, the same poll found.


The Iraq and Afghanistan war spending bill is to be voted on
Wednesday by the House of Representatives, and still requires
approval by the Senate before it goes to Bush's desk.


The measure provides 124.2 billion dollars for military
operations but adds the condition that US troops are to start
withdrawing from Iraq in October, with a non-binding target date
of completing the pullout by March 31, 2008.


The poll surveyed 1,004 Americans between April 20-23 and had an
overall margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.
