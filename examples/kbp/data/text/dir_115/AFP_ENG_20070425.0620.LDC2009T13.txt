Members of an international tribunal for Sierra Leone arrived
Wednesday in Liberia on a fact-finding mission ahead of the trial
of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing war crimes
charges in both countries.


Stephen Rapp, the prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra
Leone (SCSL), sought to reassure Liberians that Taylor would be
judged fairly when he stands in the dock.


Taylor goes on trial on June 4 at the International Criminal
Court in The Hague.


"I must state in strong terms that one of our primary concerns is
to see a fair trial carried out at the highest standards of
international justice," Rapp said.


"Another concern is the well-being and safety of our witnesses.
All efforts that are needed to be made have been made, are being
made, and will be made to protect the security and identity of
all prosecution witnesses."


Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series
of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between
1989 and 2003 which left around 400,000 people dead.


He is specifically accused of aiding the Revolutionary United
Front rebel group which murdered, enslaved and mutilated
civilians during the 1991-2001 civil war that killed up to
200,000 people in Sierra Leone.


The former warlord-turned-president has been indicted by the
United Nations- backed Special Court for Sierra Leone on charges
of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of
international human rights.
