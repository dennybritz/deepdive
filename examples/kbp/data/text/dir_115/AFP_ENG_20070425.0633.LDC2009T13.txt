Slovakian police have arrested six current and former police
officers for staging kidnappings and robberies, the country's
public prosecutor said Wednesday.


Those arrested were members of an elite police unit and were
involved in crimes between 1999 and 2005, including the 1999
abduction of a 10-year-old girl with the aim of receiving several
million Slovakian crowns in ransom, Dobroslav Trnka said.


Trnka said other arrests could follow.


In November, two former and one serving police officer were
arrested over the murder of an entrepreneur suspected of tax
fraud and having links with the local mafia.
