The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said Thursday
its interim net profit rose 16 percent to an all-time high,
leaving it well positioned for the rest of the year.


Australia's thrid largest bank said net profit for the six months
to March was 2.1 billion dollars (1.75 billion US) on the back of
strong lending.


"All in all, this is a good result," ANZ chief executive John
McFarlane said.


"It sets us up well for the year as a whole and positions us well
for the years ahead."


He said ANZ -- which late last year bought nearly a fifth of
China's biggest rural commercial lender Shanghai Rural Commercial
Bank (SRCB) -- would continue to expand its Asian business with
franchises in Malaysia, China, Guam and Laos.


"Looking ahead, the growth we are now seeing from Asia will
become more material to the group," McFarlane said.


McFarlane said cash net profit, which excludes one-off items, was
up 11.8 percent at 1.94 billion dollars, slightly exceeding
market expectations.


He said the bank maintained its full-year guidance of 7-10
percent revenue growth and 5.0-7.0 percent cost growth.


McFarlane said ANZ recorded 20.1 percent profit growth on
personal loans in the interim period, with revenue up 14.4
percent.


Institutional loans brought a 10.6 percent increase in net
profit, with revenue up 5.0 percent.


"Conditions remain supportive of good growth," McFarlane said.
"Personal (banking) should continue to do well but may find it
difficult to sustain such unusually high levels of growth."


ANZ shares were down 10 cents at 31.10 dollars in early trading
Thursday on a rising overall market.
