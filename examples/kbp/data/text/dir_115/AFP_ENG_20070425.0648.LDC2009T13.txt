The European Union Wednesday gave Senegal 1.8 million euros (2.4
million dollars) to help the northwestern African nation fight
the tide of illegal immigrants headed for the West.


"We have to avoid these human dramas and find lasting and
efficient solutions," said Gilles Hervio, the head of the EU
delegation while signing the accord in the Senegalese capital
Dakar.


The money is aimed at helping Dakar acquire new equipment to
monitor its waters to stop clandestine immigrants headed for
Europe and also to help reintegrate nationals deported from
European countries.


Senegalese Interior Minister Ousmane Ngom meanwhile called for a
"dynamic partnership" with the European Union against illegal
immigration, which he described as "almost a criminal act."


The Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelego in the Atlantic Ocean
off the northwestern coast of Africa and near Senegal, have
become one of the main destinations for illegal African migrants
hoping to get to Europe.


They often try to make the journey in dangerous, makeshift boats.


Last year, a record 31,200 illegals landed in the Canary Islands,
three times more than in 2002 when the last record of 9,929
arrivals was set.


The number of arrivals has slowed in recent months, with the
reduction viewed largely as a result of improved surveillance of
the African coast and new diplomatic efforts by Madrid towards
the migrants' countries of origin.
