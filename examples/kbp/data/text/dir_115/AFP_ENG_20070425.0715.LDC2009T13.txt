South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor said Thursday its earnings for
the first three months to March were up sharply on a year-on-year
basis but faltered badly compared with the fourth quarter.


The world's second-largest chipmaker said its operating profit
jumped 46 percent year-on-year to 446 billion won (481 million
dollars) in the first quarter.


Sales soared 69 percent to 2.45 trillion won (2.64 billion
dollars) in the March quarter, topping market expectations of
2.36 trillion won.


Compared with the previous quarter, however, the first-quarter
operating profit was down 48 percent as oversupply and weak
industry demand depressed chip prices.


Net profit came in at 429 billion won for the quarter, up 45.7
percent from a year earlier but down 58.7 percent from the three
months to December.
