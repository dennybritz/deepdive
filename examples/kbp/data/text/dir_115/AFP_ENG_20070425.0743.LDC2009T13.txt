A French national of Vietnamese origin has been jailed for 18
years in Vietnam for trafficking narcotics, state media said
Thursday.


The people's court of Ho Chi Minh City handed 53-year-old David
Dang the sentence for bringing more than one kilo (2.2 pounds) of
drugs in from Laos, the communist party's Nhan Dan newspaper
said.


Vietnam News Agency said the man, whose Vietnamese name is Dang
Van Tam, had sent in some drugs as pharmaceutical products for a
humanitarian aid organisation in 2002 and 2003.


His two local accomplices, who were medical staff of central
Khanh Hoa province, were jailed for three and four years, the
paper said.
