Apple reported its profits surged 88 percent in the recent
quarter on surging sales of iPod music players and Macintosh
computers.


Apple said its profits in the quarter ending March 31 amounted to
770 million dollars, or 87 cents per share, as compared to 410
million dollars, or 47 cents per share, in the same quarter in
2006.


"We are very pleased to report the most profitable March quarter
in Apple's history," said chief financial officer Peter
Oppenheimer.


Apple shipped 1,517,000 Macintosh computers and 10,549,000 iPods
during the first three months of this year, which represented a
36 percent rise in computer sales and a 24 percent increase in
iPod sales from the same period in 2006.


The Cupertino, California-based company posted 5.26 billion
dollars in revenues for the quarter, with international sales
accounting for 43 percent of the total.


"The Mac is clearly gaining market share, with sales growing 36
percent -- more than three times the industry growth rate," said
chief executive Steve Jobs.


"We're very excited about the upcoming launch of iPhone in late
June, and are also hard at work on some other amazing new
products in our pipeline."
