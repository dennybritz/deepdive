Two pandas selected as gifts for Hong Kong to mark the 10-year
anniversary of the former British colony's handover to the

The cubs, currently known as 606 and 610, will be welcomed at a
ceremony at Hong Kong airport in the afternoon and their names,
sifted from thousands of competition entries, will be announced,
the Xinhua news agency reported.


"The cubs are in a good shape and the 10-hour journey won't be a
big problem for them," the report said, citing an official with
the conservation center.


The 20-month cubs their left their home at a breeding centre in
Wolong, Sichuan province, in a truck, and then would fly from the
provincial capital of Chengdu to Hong Kong.
