Chinese share prices rose 0.59 percent in Thursday morning trade
on continued fund inflows with investors focused on property and
tourism stocks, dealers said.


They said that stregnth in the yuan and expectations that
Friday's dual Shanghai and Hong Kong IPO of China's CITIC bank,
the nation's seventh largest lender, was helping to buoy
sentiment.


"The market saw some profit-taking early on but the losses were
recovered by sustained capital inflows, mainly due to the recent
yuan appreciation and strong gains in overseas stock markets,"
Zhang Yi, an analyst at Yibang Investment, said.


"Many investors are confident about the debut performance by
CITIC Bank tomorrow, and started to build positions in advance."


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended the morning up 22.17
points at 3,766.13, after touching an intraday all-time high of
3,784.68.


The Shanghai A-share Index rose 23.01 points or 0.58 percent to
3,957.96 and the Shenzhen A-share Index gained 8.73 points or
0.80 percent to 1,101.77.
