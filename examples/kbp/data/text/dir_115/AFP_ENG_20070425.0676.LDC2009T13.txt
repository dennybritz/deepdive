British Prime Minister Tony Blair has not accepted a US
Congressional Gold Medal he was awarded four years ago in part
because it would reinforce perceptions that he is US President
George W. Bush's "poodle," the British ambassador to Washington
said Wednesday.


In an interview published in The Times, David Manning said that
Blair has "always had inhibitions" about accepting a medal
awarded for his address to both houses of Congress soon after the
US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003.


"For those who are convinced that the prime minister is ... some
sort of poodle, it does not matter what he does," Manning told
the daily.


"You reach the point where, if he had collected the medal, people
would say that proves their point. But it's a much better -- a
much more complicated relationship -- it's a two-way street."


Manning predicted Blair will collect the medal "when he is a
private citizen."


He also contested the assertion that Britain wielded no influence
over the United States and that it was simply its subservient
partner.


"What is crucial in the relationship is that when we take
different positions it does not affect overall co-operation ...
There has been a subtler process of engagement across a range of
issues," Manning said.
