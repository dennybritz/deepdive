Japan's Nissan Motor said Thursday net profits fell 11.1 percent
in the year to March, the first drop in annual earnings since its
legendary chief executive Carlos Ghosn took the helm in 1999.


Nissan reported net profit of 460.80 billion yen (3.98 billion
dollars), down from 518.05 billion in the previous fiscal year.


Operating profit fell by 10.9 percent to 776.94 billion yen while
revenue increased by 11.0 percent to 10.47 trillion yen.


Nissan predicted a rebound in profits in the current fiscal year,
forecasting net profit of 480 billion yen and operating profit of
800 billion yen. But it said it expected revenue to fall to 10.3
trillion yen.
