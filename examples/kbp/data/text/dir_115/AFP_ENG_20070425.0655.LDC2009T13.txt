Egyptian police shot dead two Bedouin tribesmen after they forced
a road block in the Sinai Desert and led the police on a car
chase, security sources said Wednesday.


Ahmad Abderrahim Salem and Khalil Salmane Hamid refused to stop
at one of the many road blocks on the desert roads, said the
source.


The pair also shot at police when they gave chase, said a
spokesman from the interior ministry. When police fired back
their car overturned, killing the driver on the spot. The
passenger died in hospital from a bullet wound, said a ministry
statement to AFP.


Members of their Manaiya tribe protested by burning tyres at the
side of the village of Mahdiya, in central Sinai, as the police
sealed off the village.


Several members of the tribe are being sought for arms and drugs
trafficking, said the security source.
