A moderate 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's Java
island on Thursday, seismologists said, but there were no reports
of casualties or damage.


The quake was felt by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono in the central city of Yogyakarta, local media
reported.


The undersea quake hit at 9:52 am (0252 GMT), 80 kilometres (50
miles) southeast of Bantul district in central Java at a depth of
21.9 kilometres, the Indonesian meteorological agency said.


Yogyakarta and nearby Bantul district were hard hit by an
earthquake in May last year that killed more than 5,800 people
and left thousands more homeless.


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire where
continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and volcanic
activity.


Indonesia was the nation worst hit by the earthquake-triggered
Asian tsunami in December 2004, which killed some 168,000 people
in Aceh province alone.
