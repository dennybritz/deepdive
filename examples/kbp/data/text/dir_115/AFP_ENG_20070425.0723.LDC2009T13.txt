Former child star and "Charlie's Angels" actress Drew Barrymore
has been named top of People magazine's annual "Most Beautiful"
list.


The 32-year-old actress, who shot to fame when she appeared in
Steven Spielberg's "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial" in 1982, nudged
out the likes of Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts
to take top spot.


Barrymore graces the cover of the magazine's latest issue, which
hits US newsstands on Friday, just days before the release of her
new film "Lucky You" from Warner Bros., part of the same media
group as People.


Barrymore, who has been included on People's most beautiful list
on four previous occasions, credits her success with inner
happiness.


"I just think happiness is what makes you pretty. Period," she
says in an interview with the magazine. "Happy people are
beautiful. They become like a mirror and they reflect that
happiness."


Being named top of People's most-beautiful list "made my peacock
feathers shine in the golden-hour light and extend to the
heavens," Barrymore tells the magazine.


Others on the "Beautiful People" list include Brad Pitt, George
Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Scarlett Johansson,
Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Halle Berry and Jennifer
Lopez.
