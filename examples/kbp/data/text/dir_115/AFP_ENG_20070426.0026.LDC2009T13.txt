Barry Bonds belted career home run No. 741 on Wednesday as his
pursuit of Hank Aaron's major league record of 755 continued.


In the first inning, Bonds lined a 1-1 fastball from Dodgers
starter Randy Wolf over the wall in right-center field at Dodger
Stadium for a three-run homer and 4-0 lead.


It was his seventh blast of the season - second career against
Wolf - and left him needing 15 home runs to break the all-time
mark held by Aaron.


Wolf settled down after that and the Dodgers scored a pair of
runs in both the first and fourth off San Francisco starter Noah
Lowry to draw even.


But Pedro Feliz drilled a 2-0 off-speed pitch from Wolf just over
the fence in right-center field with two outs in the sixth for
the Giants' first hit since Bonds' blast and a 5-4 edge en route
to a 6-4 victory.


Bonds finished 2-for-4 and tied Pete Rose for fifth on baseball's
all-time runs list with 2,165.


The 42-year-old slugger remained on course to break Aaron's mark
in June.


Bonds's heroics have been tainted by accusations of steroids
although he has denied any wrongdoing and never tested posititve.


But Bonds's trainer, Greg Anderson, was among five men convicted
in the BALCO steroid scandal, and for much of Bonds's career,
Major League Baseball did not test for performance-enhancing
drugs.
