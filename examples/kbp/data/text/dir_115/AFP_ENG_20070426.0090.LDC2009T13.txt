Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said Thursday in Ankara
that talks on settling the Iranian nuclear crisis had made some
progress towards a "united view."


"We are aiming just to reach out for a common paradigm to help
settling this problem. I think in some areas we are approaching a
united view and that is to say the best approach is to have the
issue settled through negotiation," Larijani told journalists.


EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said earlier Thursday he
did not expect a "great breakthrough" in a first round of new
talks to get Iran to heed UN to stop enriching uranium.


These are the first talks between Solana and Larijani since the
UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on Iran to punish its
continuing uranium enrichment, which makes fuel for civilian
reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs.


More talks are scheduled in two weeks, Larijani said Wednesday.
