The US House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a war
spending bill that sets a timeline for US troop withdrawal from
Iraq.


The Democratic-led House voted 218 to 208 to link a deadline to
the 124 billion dollar spending package, despite threats by
President George W. Bush to veto such a measure. The bill next
faces a vote in Senate.
