Hungary's unemployment rate was 7.5 percent from January to March
2007, up 0.1 percent from the December-February period, the
central statistics bureau KSH said Thursday.


In the January-March period in 2006, the jobless rate was 7.7
percent.


KSH stopped publishing monthly unemployment figures in 2002,
saying the short period resulted in an unacceptably high margin
of error. It now publishes a rolling three-month average figure.


According to Eurostat calculations, the unemployment rate for
February was 8.5 percent in Hungary, while the average rate for
all 27 EU countries was 7.7 percent.
