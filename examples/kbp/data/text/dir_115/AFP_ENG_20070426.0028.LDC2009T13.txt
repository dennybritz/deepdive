Two car bombs and a suicide bomb attack targeting a Kurdish
political party in northern Iraq killed three peshmerga fighters
and wounded 13 others on Thursday, spokesman for the party said.


The attack targeted the office of Kurdish Democratic Party in the
town of Zammar on the outskirts of Iraq's northern Kurdish
province of Dohuk, Abdul Gani Ali told AFP.


"Three peshmerga fighters are killed and 13 others wounded," Gani
said.


Thursday's attack was the second such assault targeting the
party's offices in the past three days in northern Iraq.


On Monday, a car bomb outside a KDP office in the mainly
Christian town of Tal Isquf near Mosul left 10 people dead and 20
wounded.


KDP is headed by powerful Kurdish leader Massud Barzani who is
the president of Iraq's northern Kurdistan adminstration.
