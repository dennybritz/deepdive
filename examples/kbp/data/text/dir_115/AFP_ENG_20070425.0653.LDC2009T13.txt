Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Mohamed Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah on
Wednesday came out in favour of Morocco's autonomy plan for the
disputed territory of Western Sahara, Morocco's MAP agency
reported.


Al-Sabah called the proposal an "equitable and definitive"
solution and said he expected all Arab nations to support the
initiative.


He was speaking at a joint press conference with his Moroccan
counterpart Mohamed Benaissa at Fes, 200 kilometres (125 miles)
east of Rabat.


The statement came after a meeting between officials of the two
countries, where five cooperation and investment agreements were
signed on oil and gas.


Morocco's proposed autonomy referendum in Western Sahara has
already been rejected by the Algerian-backed Polisario Front
fighting Rabat's rule in the territory.


It has submitted a rival plan that upholds "the right of the
(local) people for self-determination."


In Madrid last Saturday, thousands protested the Spanish
government's decision to support Morocco's self-determination
plan.


The demonstration was organised by groups in favour of a
referendum on Western Saharan independence.


Morocco annexed the desolate northwest African territory after
the withdrawal of Spain and neighbor Mauritania in the 1970s,
settling it with around 300,000 Moroccans in 1975.


A war ensued with the Algerian-backed Polisario Front, an armed
group which contested Rabat's sovereignty, that ended in 1991
with a UN-brokered cease-fire.
