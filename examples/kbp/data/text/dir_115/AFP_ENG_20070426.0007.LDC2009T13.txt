Sony Corp. plans to raise 300 billion yen (2.5 billion dollars)
by selling at least 30 percent of its financial unit in what is
likely to be Japan's largest initial public offering this year, a
report said Thursday.


Sony has already made a provisional application to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, which is expected to grant approval after it
receives an official request, the Nikkei business daily reported
without naming its sources.


Sony Financial Holdings will have a market capitalisation of at
least one trillion yen, according to market estimates, with a
flotation expected this autumn, the report added.


The iconic Japanese company intends to use the proceeds to
bolster its core electronics division, including the development
of flat-panel televisions, camcorders and other products, the
Nikkei said.


The financial unit serves as a holding company for Sony Life
Insurance Co., Sony Assurance Inc. and Sony Bank.


Sony said in a statement in response to the report that it
expected to take the unit public at "an appropriate time," but
declined to specify the timing or size of the offering.
