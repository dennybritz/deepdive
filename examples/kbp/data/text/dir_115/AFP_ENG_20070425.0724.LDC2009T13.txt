Snoop Dogg has been barred from Australia because he is not "the
sort of bloke we want in this country", the immigration minister
said Thursday.


The 35-year-old rapper and hip-hop icon -- real name Calvin
Broadus -- had been due to attend the MTV Australian Video Music
Awards this weekend.


But Snoop failed the character test required to enter Australia
and his visa was cancelled, Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews
said.


"He has a whole string of convictions and just two weeks ago he
was convicted of a number of charges again, sentenced to three
years jail, two on another, with five years probation and a
suspended sentence," Andrews said.


"He has been denied entry into the United Kingdom because he was
caught with others causing affray at Heathrow Airport," the
minister told Australian radio.


"He doesn't seem the sort of bloke we want in this country."


Andrews said Snoop's reputed gang ties were also taken into
consideration.


"This man has been a member of a Los Angeles gang -- and is still
associated with it apparently -- that's been involved in murder,
robberies and drug dealing in the LA area," he said.


Australia, a former penal colony which was largely populated by
criminals in the early days of European settlement, has adopted
tough immigration controls under conservative Prime Minister John
Howard.
