Canada has demanded Kabul investigate allegations of the torture
of prisoners turned over to local authorities by Canadian
soldiers fighting in Afghanistan, the defense minister said
Wednesday.


In the face of opposition calls for his resignation over a media
report that the detainees suffer whips with electrical cables,
electric shocks, exposure to cold temperatures and beatings,
Defense Minister Gordon O'Connor said the Ottawa was pursuing the
issue with Kabul.


"Canadian officials have expressed our concerns both to the
Afghan government and to the Afghan Independent Human Rights
Commission, and we have strongly urged them to investigate the
allegations and if required to take corrective actions," he said
to a parliamentary commission.


An investigative report by The Globe and Mail daily newspaper
uncovered "a litany of gruesome stories and a clear pattern of
abuse by the Afghan authorities who work closely with Canadian
troops."


Monday's Globe and Mail report, which was based on interviews
with 30 former prisoners of Kandahar jails, contained no mention
of any abuse by Canadian forces.


Canada has a contingent of about 2,500 troops in Afghanistan
engaged in the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked
fighters.
