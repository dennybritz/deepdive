The commander of a US military prison in Iraq has been detained
by military police and is under investigation pending a possible
court martial, a military spokeswoman said Thursday.


Lieutenant Colonel William Steele will face a hearing before a
panel of officers to decide whether he should face charges,
Lieutenant Colonel Josslyn Aberle told AFP in Baghdad, without
specifying the charges.


"He has been detained and is now in Kuwait. His current status is
that he is in confinement and waiting for his Article 32 hearing.
All other details will be released soon, including the charges
against him," she said.


According to the website of the US television network NBC, citing
a statement from the US army, Steele could be prosecuted for
"aiding the enemy" and having improper relationships with his
translator and another Iraqi woman.


Other charges involve the improper use of military funds,
disobeying orders, illegally holding on to classified material
and keeping pornography, it said.


The military in Iraq was not able to immediately confirm this.


Prior to his arrest, Steel was the commander of Camp Cropper, a
major US detention facility outside Baghdad, the smaller of two
remaining coalition prisons in Iraq which between them hold
almost 18,000 suspected insurgents.


Iraq's former dictator Saddam Hussein, who was executed on
December 30 after being convicted by an Iraqi court of crimes
against humanity, received medical treatment there but was not
held there permanently.
