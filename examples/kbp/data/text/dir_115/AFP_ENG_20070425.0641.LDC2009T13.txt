US President George W. Bush and Czech President Vaclav Klaus on
Wednesday discussed US plans to build a missile defense shield
despite strong opposition from Moscow, the White House said.


"President Bush told the president he looks forward to traveling
to Prague in June," said national security spokesman Gordon
Johndroe.


"They also discussed missile defense as well as a number of
bilateral and regional issues," Johndroe said in a statement.


The telephone conversation came as Klaus prepared for a four-day
state visit to Russia, starting Thursday, with relations strained
by Prague's willingness to host part of an expanded US missile
defense shield.


Russian hostility to the controversial US project for a tracking
radar in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in
neighboring Poland is set to dominate the meeting between Klaus
and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, scheduled for
Friday.


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to redouble US
attempts  to overcome Russian opposition to US bases on its
doorstep in Eastern Europe during an informal meeting of NATO and
Russian foreign ministers in Oslo on Thursday.


That encounter follows Moscow's rebuff to US Defense Secretary
Robert Gates on Monday after he delivered fresh assurances that
the defensive shield is aimed at Iran's growing threat and not
Russia's established nuclear arsenal.
