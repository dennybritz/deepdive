Seeing Beijing and its Olympic stadiums has helped Australian
star Grant Hackett regain his hunger to once again dominate world
swimming.


But first the 26-year-old needs to shake off the effects of a leg
infection that hospitalised him in the Chinese capital this week.


Olympic champion Hackett was placed on a drip again Wednesday and
given a strong course of antibiotics to help ease swelling in his
right leg, the Melbourne Herald Sun reported Thursday.


"They just wanted me back on a drip to further reduce the
infection," said the 26-year-old, who is on a fact-finding
mission to Beijing ahead of next year's Games.


"I just can't believe cuts on my legs from reef coral on my
honeymoon can turn into this. I'm just so relieved they got to it
early because it could have been a lot worse."


The once-unbeatable Hackett was hopelessly out of sorts at last
month's world championships in Melbourne, beaten in his pet
1,500m freestyle for the first time in more than a decade.


He also lost his 400m and 800m freestyle world titles.


But being in Beijing has helped whet his appetite again.


"It's a very different way of life and I take a lot away from my
few days in Beijing," he told the paper, adding that he planned
to start training again next week.


"Certainly from my perspective, it has made me hungrier than ever
to get back in the pool. Being able to see the venues and the
cultural differences have been eye openers.


"I think a loss can breed hunger, and I don't mind going from the
hunted to the hunter.


"I am now chasing my rivals and that suits me fine."
