Oscar-winner Robin Williams and John Travolta have signed on to
star in a Disney comedy, "Old Dogs," Variety reported Wednesday.


The buddy movie tells the story of old friends whose lives are
turned upside down when they find themselves responsible for
seven-year-old twins, the report said.


The film, directed by Walt Becker, also was to feature Travolta's
daughter, Ella Travolta.


Travolta, 53, was a ladykiller in "Saturday Night Fever," just a
killer in "Pulp Fiction," and is now hoping to kill at the box
office as a transvestite in the silver-screen adaptaion of the
musical "Hairspray."


Williams, 55, took home a best supporting actor Academy Award in
1998 for "Good Will Hunting," and recently starred in "RV,"
"Happy Feet," "Man of the Year" and the upcoming "License to
Wed."
