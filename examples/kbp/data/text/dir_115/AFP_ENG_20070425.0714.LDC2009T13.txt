The White House denounced Wednesday the US House of
Representatives's approval of legislation setting a timetable to
withdraw US troops from Iraq as a vote for "failure" that
President George W. Bush will veto.


The 218-208 vote by the Democratic-majority House links release
of 124 billion dollars in military spending for Iraq and
Afghanistan to a schedule for the pullout of American troops,
beginning as early as October.


Bush wants the Senate now to quickly vote on the legislation so
the final text can come to his desk to be struck down and be
replaced by a new bill, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said
shortly after the House vote.


"The House of Representatives has passed disappointing
legislation that insists on a surrender date, handcuffs our
generals, and contains billions of dollars in spending unrelated
to the war," Perino said in a statement.


"Tonight, the House of Representatives voted for failure in Iraq
-- and the president will veto its bill," she said.


She said Democrats, who took control of Congress in November
elections marked by voter anger at the war in Iraq, "have forced
this process to continue for too long."


"The president calls on the Senate to quickly pass this
legislation so the president can veto it and then work with the
Congressional leadership on a clean bill that funds our troops
while respecting the judgment of our military commanders and
helping ensure the safety of the American people," she said.
