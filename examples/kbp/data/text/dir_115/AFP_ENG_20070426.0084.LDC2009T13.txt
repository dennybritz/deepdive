Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said Thursday in Ankara
that talks on settling the Iranian nuclear crisis had made some
progress towards a "united view."


"We are aiming just to reach out for a common paradigm to help
settling this problem. I think in some areas we are approaching a
united view and that is to say the best approach is to have the
issue settled through negotiation," Larijani told journalists.
