Malaysia Airlines has asked rivals Airbus and Boeing to bid for a
contract to sell up to 55 single-aisle aircraft with potential
value of about 4.43 billion dollars, a report said Thursday.


The New Straits Times said both the manufacturers were expected
to submit their proposals for a June deadline in an exercise
aimed at replacing the national carrier's 39 ageing B737-300s.


Airbus chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy, told
the newspaper the European manufacturer had received the request
for proposals (RFP) from Malaysia Airlines.


"All I can say right now is that we have received the RFPs from
MAS for our single-aisle aircraft about a week ago. I can't go
into details on the matter," he was quoted as saying.


Citing unnamed sources, the daily said Airbus would propose its
A320s or A321s, while US firm Boeing is expected to submit a
proposal for its B737-800s or B737-900ERs.


It said the upgrading exercise would cost Malaysia Airlines
between 3.3 billion and 4.43 billion dollars, and that the
carrier wanted to take delivery of the first plane at the end of
next year.
