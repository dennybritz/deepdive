Chinese oil major Sinopec has no plans to pull out of resource-
rich Africa despite an attack on one of its oil projects in
Ethiopia that left 77 people dead, state media said Thursday.


"There is no way we would stay away from Africa due to the fear
of risk," a Sinopec spokesman told the China Daily newspaper on
condition of anonymity.


"This is not a game for us. We will try to improve security in
the future but there is no way we will withdraw from our projects
there."


Sinopec is the parent of Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau,
the operater of the oilfield, where 68 Ethiopians and nine
Chinese workers were killed in Tuesday's pre-dawn assault by
rebel gunman.


Seven other Chinese workers were kidnapped and remained
unaccounted for according to reports on Thursday.


The attack has highlighted energy-dependent China's growing
vulnerability as it scours the world for oil, gas and uranium and
other raw materials to power its voracious economy.


While the attack was unlikely to prompt divestment of other
Chinese interests in Africa, it may force Beijing into a deeper
level of engagement with its African trading partners, analysts
told the newspaper.


"This incident will not have a major influence on China's
investment in Africa," said Shi Yinhong, a professor of
international relations at Renmin University of China.


"It's possible that China may use its influence and business
leverage to make the African governments offer more effective
protection of China's economic interests," he added.
