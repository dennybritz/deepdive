China will further reduce tax incentives for exporters that
produce items requiring large amounts of energy, the top state
planning agency said Thursday.


The National Development and Reform Commission said export tax
rebates would be reduced on a series of energy-intensive items
but did not give a full list of the products affected nor say how
much the rates would be cut.


It announced the move as it published figures for rapid
investment growth in a number of energy-heavy industries.


Investment in the cement sector rose 39.4 percent year-on-year in
the first quarter of this year, with aluminum up 49.3 percent,
the commission said.


Energy consumption in the iron and steel, non-ferrous metals,
refinery, power, coke, construction materials and chemical
sectors accounted for 70 percent of the total in 2006, it said.


China earlier this month scrapped export rebates for 83 types of
steel products.


In the 11th Five-Year Plan running to 2010, China set a 20
percent reduction target for energy consumption per unit of gross
domestic product.


Last year, China failed to reach its goal of reducing energy use
per unit of GDP by 4.0 percent and cutting emissions by 2.0
percent.
