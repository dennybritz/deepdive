Ivory Coast has set its 2007 budget at 2.9 billion euros (3.9
billion dollars), down three percent year-on-year, due to a fall
in cocoa production in the world's top grower, a minister said
Wednesday.


Economy and Finance Minister Charles Diby Koffi told AFP that the
three-billion- euro budget in 2006, a 13.3 percent increase over
the previous year, had been spurred by a rise in petroleum
revenues.


But he blamed the cut in this year's budget to a 6.1 percent fall
in cocoa production last year, which stood at 1.3 million tonnes.


Ivory Coast's newly-found petrol wealth has earned more money
with production jumping 50.7 percent to 21.9 million barrels, he
said.


Koffi said the government was borrowing 45.8 million euros from
the market to make up the budget shortfall.


Ivory Coast, France's former star colony in Africa and the
world's top cocoa producer, was a beacon of stability and
prosperity in restive west Africa until it split in half in 2002
following a failed coup which led to a low-intensity war.
