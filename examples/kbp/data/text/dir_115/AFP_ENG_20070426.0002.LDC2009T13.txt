Australian economic growth appears set to pick up as resource
exports rise and the housing market revives, according to an
economic survey released Thursday.


The Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index, which indicates
the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months into
the future, was 5.7 percent in February, well above its long-term
trend of 4.1 percent.


Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the index had lifted in
the past three months, pointing to an upturn in economic growth.


"The index continues to point to an acceleration in economic
growth over the next three to six months," Evans said.


"Resource exports are set to build strongly and interest rate
stability is likely to see the housing market surge after a
number of flat years.


"Business investment growth is likely slow although the levels of
business investment will remain healthy supporting much needed
capacity expansion."


Evans said official data showing inflation rose by a lower-than-
expected 0.1 percent in the March quarter meant interest rates
were likely to remain on hold at 6.25 percent for the rest of the
year.


He said year-on-year inflation was at 2.4 percent, well within
the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2.0-3.0 percent target band.


"With the bank eschewing a pre-emptive approach to rate setting
to adopt a policy driven by current inflation reads, the bank is
now unlikely to move on rates this calendar year," he said.


"We look for rates to resume rising from early 2008."
