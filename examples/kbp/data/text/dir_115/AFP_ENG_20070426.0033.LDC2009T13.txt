Military-ruled Myanmar and communist North Korea signed an
agreement Thursday to restore diplomatic relations, Myanmar's
deputy foreign minister Kyaw Thu told reporters.


"This morning we signed an agreement to restore diplomatic ties,"
Kyaw Thu said after meeting with his North Korean counterpart,
Kim Yong-Il.


"We have to notify the United Nations, according to their
procedures, and then the UN will do some formalities and announce
to the international community that our two countries will resume
diplomatic ties," Kyaw Thu said.


Myanmar severed ties with North Korea in 1983 after Pyongyang
organised a deadly bomb attack in a bid to assassinate South
Korea's then president Chun Doo Hwan, who was on an official
visit to Yangon.


But relations have warmed recently, with analysts saying that is
partly due to a perception that they have a common enemy in the
United States, which has branded both countries as "outposts of
tyranny."


Kyaw Thu and Kim Yong-Il had met for about an hour early
Thursday, before heading to a Yangon hotel along with China's
ambassador to Myanmar, Guan Mu.


The Myanmar official made the announcement two hours later.
