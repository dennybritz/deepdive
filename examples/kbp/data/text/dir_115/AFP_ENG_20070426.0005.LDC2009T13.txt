New-York based Corning Inc said Thursday its board of directors
has approved a capital expenditure plan of 129 million US dollars
to expand its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan.


The investment will enable its plant in central Taichung to have
Generation 8 manufacturing capability, Corning said in a
statement, adding that it will also create additional finishing
capacity for Gen 7.5.


Gen 8 is currently the largest glass substrate available, but
next-generation substrates are already on the horizon, it said.


The expenditure will be incurred over two-and-a-half years, with
glass substrate production expected to begin by mid-2008.


"As LCD becomes a leading technology for televisions in the
40-inch and larger size range, this expansion helps our customers
in Taiwan and Japan meet the growing demand," James P. Clappin,
president of Corning Display Technologies, said in the statement.


Corning is the world's largest maker of liquid crystal display
glass used in flat-panel televisions.
