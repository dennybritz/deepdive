Doctors from South and North Korea began  working together on
Thursday at a hospital inside the Kaesong joint industrial
complex just north of the border, officials said.


It was the first time doctors from the two nations have worked
together at the same hospital since the end of the 1950-53 Korean
War, Yonhap news agency said.


North and South Korea remain technically at war after the
conflict ended in an armistice without a follow-up peace treaty.


A South Korean group called Green Doctors established emergency
medical services in January 2005 at Kaesong, a Seoul-funded
industrial estate which employs mainly North Korean workers.


The group has since then provided free medical services for about
20,000 workers from South and North Korea and plans to open a
general hospital at Kaesong by early 2008.


The South will handle surgery, dental work and internal diseases,
while the North will specialise in eye care, Oriental medicine,
obstetrics and gynaecology.


Medical officials from the two sides have been preparing for the
launch of the joint medical services for several months. About 30
medical staff, including nurses and paramedics from both
countries, will back up the doctors.


Currently some 13,000 mainly North Korean workers at Kaesong are
employed by 22 South Korean firms, which produce labour-intensive
products such as garments and kitchenware.


South Korea denies the proceeds are helping bolster the North's
regime. It says Kaesong is teaching the communist state the
workings of a free-market economy.
