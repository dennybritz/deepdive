Japan's Toshiba Corp. said Thursday its net profit jumped 76
percent in the year to March due to strong sales and its giant
purchase of US power plant maker Westinghouse.


The electronics and engineering giant said it registered net
profit of 137.4 billion yen (1.16 billion dollars) in the past
financial year, up from 78.2 billion yen in the previous period.


Toshiba said its revenue was up 12 percent at 7.12 trillion yen,
with operating profit gaining seven percent to 258.4 billion yen.


The company credited a strong performance overall including its
giant purchase of Westinghouse from British Nuclear Fuels.


"The power systems business saw sales rise on the consolidation
of Westinghouse into the group," a statement said.


However, for the coming financial year it projected that net
profit would go down 17.4 percent to 120 billion yen, in part due
to the costs of consolidating Westinghouse.
