Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest custom
chip maker, said Thursday its first quarter net profit dropped 32
percent year-on-year as an inventory correction continued to hit.


However the company said that the pressue on prices had eased
somewhat and it felt the picture would improve further over the
balance of the year.


At 18.84 billion dollars (570 million US), the three months to
March profit was also down 42 percent from the same period last
year, it said.


Sales fell 13 percent to 64.90 billion dollars sequentially and
were down 16 percent year-on-year.


TSMC said it expects sales in the second quarter to June to rise
to 73-75 billion dollars, with the gross profit margin at 42-44
percent, up from 37.9 percent in the three months to March.


"We believe that this recovery will be sustained over the
remainder of the year as demand has certainly recovered," TSMC
chief executive officer Rick Tsai said.


"I'm not saying it has disappeared entirely but pricing pressure
is moderating," he added.
