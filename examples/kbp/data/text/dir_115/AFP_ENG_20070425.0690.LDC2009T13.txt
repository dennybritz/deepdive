Prime Minister John Howard said Thursday he would "amazed" if
Australia failed to bring home cricket's World Cup after the
semi-final win over South Africa edged them closer to a third
straight title.


Australia face Sri Lanka on Saturday after overwhelming the South
Africans with a crushing seven-wicket win in St Lucia.


"I would be amazed if Australia didn't win," Howard told the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation.


"This is an incredibly consistent and strong Australian team and
the ease in which we defeated South Africa a few hours ago is a
very good omen," said the prime minister, who is an ardent
cricket fan.


But Howard warned captain Ricky Ponting's squad not to take
victory for granted as the Sri Lankans would be tough opponents.


"I'm sure Ricky Ponting will be telling his men not to be
complacent," Howard said.


"That's one of the reasons why he keeps winning: he never takes
things for granted and nobody should do that in sport or indeed
in anything else," he added.


South Africa were dismissed for 149, their lowest-ever Cup total,
as Australia's Shaun Tait finished with 4-39 and man-of-the-match
Glenn McGrath took 3-18.
