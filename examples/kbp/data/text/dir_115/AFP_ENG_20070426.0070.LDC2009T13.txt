Five Iraqi soldiers were killed and 13 wounded when a suicide
bomber exploded his car against a joint Iraqi army and police
checkpoint north of Baghdad on Thursday, a defence official said.


The bombing took place at around 10:00 am (0600 GMT) in the town
of Khalis in the restive province of Diyala where insurgents have
recently stepped up attacks against security forces, he said.


On Wednesday, a bomber wearing an explosive vest walked into a
police station in the town of Balad Ruz in Diyala and blew
himself up, killing four policemen and wounding 16 others.


And on Monday, nine US soldiers were killed and 20 more wounded
when two suicide truck bombers exploded their vehicles against
their patrol base in the province, in what was the deadliest
attack on US ground troops in 16 months.
