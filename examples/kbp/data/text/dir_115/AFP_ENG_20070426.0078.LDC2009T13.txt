Europe's main stock markets gained ground in opening deals on
Thursday after a record overnight showing on Wall Street.


In initial European trade, London's FTSE 100 index of leading
shares won 0.47 percent to 6,492.10 points, Frankfurt's DAX 30
gained 0.34 percent to 7,368.54 and in Paris the CAC 40 index
added 0.54 percent to 5,979.57.


The US Dow Jones Industrial Average share index had struck a
record peak on Wednesday, smashing the 13,000-point barrier for
the first time as investors cheered ballooning corporate profits,
dealers said.
