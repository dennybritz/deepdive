Attacks are on the rise in western Ivory Coast since foreign
troops began withdrawing from a buffer zone dividing rebel- and
government-held areas, an aid organisation said Wednesday.


MSF, or Doctors Without Borders, said its team in Bangolo, some
500 kilometres (313 miles) west of Abidjan, has reported a new
wave of violence since April 16, when the buffer zone started
being dismantled.


"A minibus was attacked and burglaries, killings and rapes are
the daily lot of people and those travelling through this zone,"
it said, adding that MSF doctors had tended to six victims of
"aggression." A seventh had died, it said.


The buffer zone patrolled by UN peacekeepers and French soldiers
started being dismantled earlier this month following a peace
deal between the country's president and a former rebel leader.


Ivory Coast, a former French colony that had long been a beacon
of peace and prosperity in west Africa, had been sliced in half
since 2002 when former rebel leader Guillaume Soro mounted a
failed coup against President Laurent Gbagbo.


After several mediation attempts by France, the United Nations,
the African Union and a West African regional bloc failed,
President Gbagbo and Soro finalised their own peace deal on March
4.


Under the agreement, Soro became prime minister in a transitional
government, but doubts remain over the two men's commitment to
power sharing.
