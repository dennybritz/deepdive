South Korea said Thurday it would send 13 million dollars in aid
to North Korean children through three international aid
agencies.


"We decided to send 13 million dollars in aid to North Korean
children at the request of related agencies," Vice Unification
Minister Shin Un-Sang told reporters.


He said Seoul would donate 9.38 million dollars to the World
Health Organisation, 3.15 million dollars to the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and 500,000 dollars to the International
Vaccine Institute.


The move came four days after South Korea agreed to resume its
annual rice aid to the North starting next month despite a
protracted banking dispute delaying North Korea's
denuclearisation.


Seoul suspended its rice shipment after the North's missile tests
last July. Ties soured further after Pyongyang's October nuclear
test, but improved when the North returned to the six-nation
nuclear disarmament talks.


The North missed an April 14 deadline to start shutting down its
nuclear programme under a six-nation accord reached in February.


Pyongyang says it will only start implementing the deal after it
receives 25 million dollars which had been frozen at a Macau
bank.
