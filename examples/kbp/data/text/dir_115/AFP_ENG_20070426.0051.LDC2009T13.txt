EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana ruled out on Thursday any
"great breakthrough" in his talks here with Iranian negotiator
Ali Larijani on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme.


"We had a constructive meeting (but) we will not be in a position
to make a great breakthrough during this visit," he told
reporters as he left his hotel for a meeting with Larijani and
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.


"But we hope we will be able to continue (the talks). We
discussed many things," he said.


Solana and Larijani arrived here Wednesday and had a five-hour
meeting about ending the stand-off resulting from Iran's defiance
of UN Security Council demands for it to stop enriching uranium.


Speaking to reporters late Wednesday, Larijani reported some
progress, telling reporters: "There are ideas on the table."


"In about two weeks time again we would be having some more
talks," Larijani said, describing his meeting with Solana as
"pleasant."


After a working breakfast with Gul the two men are scheduled to
meet Yigit Alpogan, head of the National Security Council,
Turkey's top advisory body.


They are expected to hold a press conference later Thursday.
