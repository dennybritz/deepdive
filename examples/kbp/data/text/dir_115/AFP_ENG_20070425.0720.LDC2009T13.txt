Japanese share prices rose 0.75 percent in morning trade Thursday
after Wall Street's Dow Jones index broke through the 13,000
points barrier overnight for the first time ever, dealers said.


They said investors were also digesting a slew of domestic
earnings reports and gearing up for another raft of results after
the close of trade.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
gained 129.48 points to 17,365.64 by the lunch break, a day after
sliding 1.24 percent.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares added 7.65
points or 0.45 percent to 1,694.99, after dropping below the
symbolic 1,700-point mark on Wednesday.
