A Palestinian activist seriously wounded in an Israeli air raid
on Gaza City last November died of his wounds Wednesday, hospital
sources said.


Omar Abou Sharea, 26, was a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs
Brigades, an armed group linked to Fatah, the party of
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas.


His death brings to 5,670 the number of people killed since the
start of the Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in September
2000, according to an AFP tally. The great majority of those
killed have been Palestinians.
