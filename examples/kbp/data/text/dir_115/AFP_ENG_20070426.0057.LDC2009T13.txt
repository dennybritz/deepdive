A US anti-missile shield planned for eastern Europe could not
threaten the effectiveness of Russia's huge nuclear arsenal, US
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defence Secretary Robert
Gates said Thursday.


The planned system, which Moscow angrily denounces as as a threat
to Russian security, is "orientated against a potential enemy
with a small arsenal," the US officials wrote in Russia's
Nezavisimaya Gazeta.


"This system is of no use against a huge nuclear and ballistic
missile arsenal, such as that possessed by Russia. Talk of a new
'arms race' with Russia is anachronistic and not grounded in
reality," they wrote.


The topic was expected to feature prominently during talks
Thursday in Oslo among the 26 NATO allies and between NATO and
Russia.


Washington wants to station 10 non-explosive missile interceptors
in Poland and a tracking radar in the Czech Republic, saying this
will help shield Europe from ballistic missile strikes by states
like Iran or North Korea.


Gates tried to assuage Russian concerns during a visit to Moscow
this week, when he renewed and expanded US offers to cooperate
actively with the Russians on missile defence matters. However,
Russia gave a cool response to the offer.
