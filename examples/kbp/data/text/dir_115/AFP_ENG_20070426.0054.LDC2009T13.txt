Australian share prices closed up 0.39 percent Thursday as the
market was buoyed by Wall Street's record-breaking performance,
dealers said.


The benchmark SP/ASX200 rose 24.0 points to 6,212.2 after the US
Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 13,000-point mark
for the first time, with the Australian index, just 24.7 points
short of its own record, set April 18.


The broader All Ordinaries index rose 24.5 points to 6,197.8,
also just shy of an all-time high recorded April 18.
