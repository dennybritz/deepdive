The commander of the US military prison in Iraq which held former
dictator Saddam Hussein has been detained by military police and
is under investigation, a military spokeswoman said Thursday.


Lieutenant Colonel William Steele will face a hearing before a
panel of officers to decide whether he should face a court
martial, Lieutenant Colonel Josslyn Aberle told AFP in Baghdad,
without specifying the charges.


"He has been detained and is now in Kuwait. His current status is
that he is in confinement and waiting for his Article 32 hearing.
All other details will be released soon, including the charges
against him," she said.
