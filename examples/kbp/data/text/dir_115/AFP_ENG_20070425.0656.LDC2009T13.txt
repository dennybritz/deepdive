The US House of Representatives on Thursday overwhelmingly
approved legislation calling on Arab states to help end genocide
in the Darfur region of Sudan.


By a 425-1 vote, lawmakers in the lower house of Congress
approved a resolution calling on member nations of the League of
Arab States to take more aggressive action to help put an end to
the violence in Darfur.


Democratic Representative Barbara Lee, who authored the measure,
said her "Darfur Partners for Peace Act" calls for greater action
by Arab states, which so far have taken a hands-off attitude
toward the crisis.


"For too long they have been silent partners in this struggle,"
she said after the vote.


The measure urges Arab League nations to declare that the
systematic torture, rape and displacement of the people of Darfur
is genocide. It calls on them to support a robust United Nations
and African Union peacekeeping force to enforce the ceasefire.


The bill also bolsters humanitarian aid in Darfur and supports
the work of non- governmental organizations in the region.
