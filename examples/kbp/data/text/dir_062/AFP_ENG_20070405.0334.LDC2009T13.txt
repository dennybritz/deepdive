Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor believes he will be recognised
as Africa's top footballer within three years.


Adebayor, 23, has established himself as a key figure for Arsenal
this season and the Togo international has set his sights on
being voted Africa's finest player sooner rather than later.


The former Monaco forward, who joined Arsenal for seven million
pounds in January 2006, has stiff competition for the honour.
Chelsea's Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba is the current African
Player of the Year, and his Blues team-mate Michael Essien of
Ghana is regarded as one of the best young players in the world.


Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o can also claim to be Africa's best, but
Adebayor, boosted by his 10-goal haul for Arsenal this season, is
aiming high.


"I'm getting better and better," he told the London Evening
Standard. "I have plenty of time to win the African Footballer of
the Year. I have been second once and third once, so I believe I
can win it within the next two or three years.


"I am learning a lot at Arsenal. It would be great to be one of
the best in the world one day. That is why I am working hard.


"For me the important thing is to be consistent. In every game I
have to show I am a good player."
