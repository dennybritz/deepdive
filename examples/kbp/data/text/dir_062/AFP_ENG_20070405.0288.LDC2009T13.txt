Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych said Thursday he had
invited Austrian and other European mediators to help resolve a
deepening political crisis in this ex-Soviet republic.


"I have taken a decision to bring in international mediators: the
Austrian chancellor (Alfred Gusenbauer) -- Austria is a neutral
country -- and well-known European legal experts," he said.
