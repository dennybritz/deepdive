Canadian job growth accelerated last month, but the country's
unemployment rate held firm at 6.1 percent as more people joined
the labor force, the government said Thursday.


A total of 55,000 people gained new jobs in March, smashing
analysts' predictions which had called for job growth of between
13,000 and 15,000 new posts, according to Statistics Canada.


"We saw astonishing strength in the Canadian labor market in
March," said Eric Lascelles, an analyst at TD Securities.


For the first quarter of 2007, 158,000 new jobs were created,
marking the strongest surge in first quarter job growth since
2002, the government agency said.


Canada's job market has strengthened fast in recent months and
the latest hirings have boosted employment levels to their
highest readings in 31 years.


Lascelles said it was becoming more likely that the Bank of
Canada would move to favoring interest rate hikes going forward
if job growth continues to boom. The current base rate in Canada
is 4.25 percent.


Strong demand from the service sector helped lift overall job
growth last month.
