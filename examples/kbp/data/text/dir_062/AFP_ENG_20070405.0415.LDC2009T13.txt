A dentist was barred from his practice when he was found guilty
Thursday of urinating in a surgical sink and using sterilised
dental instruments on his ears and nails.


Alan Hutchinson, a 51-year-old father of three, was erased from
the dental register after a medical tribunal in London found him
to have acted in an inappropriate and unprofessional way at his
clinic in Batley, northern England.


The General Dental Council heard how Hutchinson used unhygienic
practices, including probing his ears and cleaning his
fingernails with sterilised tools, refusing to routinely wear
gloves and urinating in the clinic sink.


He had pleaded not guilty to all the charges except that of not
regularly wearing gloves, claiming he had a latex allergy.


During the hearing in London, dental nurse Claire Pygott said she
could smell urine coming from a sink moments after seeing
Hutchinson "tucking something" into his trousers before seeing a
patient in March last year.


The case came to light after an unnamed woman, whose family also
used the clinic, told North Kirklees Primary Care Trust that
Hutchinson had refused to wear gloves while removing her wisdom
tooth.
