The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has cancelled
more than 20 illegal lumbering rights, covering nearly three
million hectares (7.4 million acres) of forest, the environment
minister said Thursday.


DR Congo Environment Minister Didace Pembe told AFP that the
forest concerned which had been divided up between 16 companies
would revert to public ownership by month's end.


The 21 cases for cancellation concern forestry rights either
obtained in violation of the law, or that have not been the
subject of a request for conversion into a licence agreement.


Holders of the cancelled rights, mostly small companies, have two
weeks to contest, he added.


Large lumber firms which cover 70 percent of the production
capacity in DR Congo, such as Safbois, Sodefor, Siforco or
Soforma, are not affected by the cancellations.
