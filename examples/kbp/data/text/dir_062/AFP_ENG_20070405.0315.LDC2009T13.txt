Supporters of a Spanish parish where three priests celebrated
Mass in their jeans have launched a graffiti protest against an
order that religious services stop being held there.


"They will not close our church" and "blessed are the persecuted"
are among some of the messages spray-painted on the yellow walls
of the San Carlos Borromeo church in the working-class Madrid
district of Entrevias.


Earlier this week the conservative Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Madrid, Antonio Rouco Varela, transfered management of the
church's facilities to a charity and banned mass from being held
there.


The parish has helped the poor, immigrants, troubled youths,
recovering drug addicts and other outcasts for nearly three
decades and the decision to ban services has been met with
outrage from parishioners.


The Church argues it had decided in 1985 to relieve the parish of
its "pastoral duties" so it could focus on providing help to the
needy.


But the parish's three priests, who handed out biscuits instead
of communion wafers during services, have said they plan to defy
the archbishop's order and keep holding Mass, including on Easter
Sunday.
