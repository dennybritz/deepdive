Germany's powerful IG Metall labour union has said some of its
members could be implicated in the corruption scandal that has
hit electrical engineering giant Siemens.


"We are expecting cases to come up within our ranks as well,"
Ralf Heckmann, a member of IG Metall and head of the central
works council of Siemens, told the magazine Euro am Sonntag which
will appear on Sunday.


Heckmann said he could not vouch for the more than 100 union
members who sit on the works council at Siemens.


Under German law, works councils -- composed of representatives
of workers and management -- have a strong decision-making role
within major companies.


A Siemens board member was arrested last week as part of a major
bribery investigation against the company.


He is suspected of paying 15-20 million euros (20-26 million
dollars) in bogus consultancy fees over a number of years to
Wilhelm Schelsky, head of the tiny AUB labour union.


The alleged aim of the payments was to build up the union into a
sort of counterweight to IG Metall.


IG Metall has subsequently filed a lawsuit against Siemens in the
matter, accusing management of attempting to influence elections
to the works council or the work of council members.


Siemens is also engulfed at the moment in a massive slush fund
scandal.


Prosecutors allege that company managers siphoned off hundreds of
millions of euros in company money to obtain foreign contracts.
