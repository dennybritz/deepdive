President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will visit the key Iranian nuclear
plant in the central city of Natanz on Monday to mark the
national day of nuclear technology.


"Ceremonies marking the national day of nuclear technology will
be organised in the presence of President Ahmadinejad in Natanz
on April 9," said a statement from Iran's atomic energy
organisation.


Ahmadinejad has promised that he will soon be announcing "good
news" about Iran's nuclear programme, and news of his visit is
likely to fuel speculation he will choose the occasion to make an
important announcement.


The head of Iran's atomic energy organisation, Gholam Reza
Aghazadeh, had said on Monday that the Islamic republic would be
announcing good news on its nuclear programme next week.


Natanz is the plant where Iran carries out enrichment of uranium,
a sensitive process that the West fears could be diverted to make
nuclear weapons. Iran insists the atomic drive is peaceful.


Iran has vowed to install thousands of uranium enriching
centrifuges at the plant to bring its enrichment to an industrial
scale but so far it has only confirmed the completion of a
fraction of this number.
