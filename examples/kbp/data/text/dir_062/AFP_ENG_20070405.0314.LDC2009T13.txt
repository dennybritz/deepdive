Gunmen on Thursday attacked a group of Iraqi soldiers based
outside the restive northern city of Mosul, killing at least
seven in the ambush, security officials told AFP.


The soldiers came under attack just outside the village of
Zeenazeel, 20 kilometres (13 miles) west of Mosul.


One Iraqi official put the death toll at seven, while another
told AFP that 10 soldiers had been killed in the ambush.


The attack comes just two days after Iraqi and US forces launched
a crackdown in Mosul to curb insurgent and sectarian violence
plaguing what is Iraq's third largest city.


On Wednesday, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said a
massive military operation, now pushing into an eighth week in
Baghdad, was being extended elsewhere and had been underway in
Mosul since Tuesday.
