Moroccan customs officers seized a record 87 tonnes of cannabis
resin last year, 37 percent up on 2005, an official said
Thursday.


They also confiscated 52 million cigarettes compared to 45
million in 2005, many being smuggled through the Spanish enclaves
of Ceuta and Melilla north of Morocco.


Fiscal receipts for Morrocan customs were also at a record high
of 4.8 billion euros (6.4 billion dollars) compared to 4.4 the
previous year.
