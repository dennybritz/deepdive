Mauritanian authorities have detained at least seven suspected
extremists, including one member of the country's military,
security officials said Thursday.


Those detained included four Mauritanians and three Algerians,
the official said on condition of anonymity. They were detained
last week.


A separate security official said more arrests had been made in
recent days, without giving further details.


An Algerian Islamist group believed to be linked to Al-Qaeda has
operated in the region in recent years, though it was unclear if
the arrests were related.


Because of threats from the Islamist group, two stages of the
Dakar 2007 Rally between Mauritania and Mali were cancelled on
the recommendation of French authorities.


The group attacked a military base in northeastern Mauritania in
2005, causing 15 deaths and 17 injuries.


Authorities have since arrested about 30 suspected members of the
group, which recently began calling itself the Armed Branch of
Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb. It was previously known as the
Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat.


Under Mauritanian law, those arrested for suspected terrorism
remain in custody for 30 days before being handed over to
prosecutors.
