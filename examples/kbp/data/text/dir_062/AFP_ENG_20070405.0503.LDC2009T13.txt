The hostage crisis between Britain and Iran ended in a "double
victory" for Tehran, former US ambassador to the United Nations
John Bolton said Thursday.


"In a way I think the regime in Tehran has won a double victory,"
said Bolton, interviewed on the US-funded Alhurra Arabic-language
television network, about Iran's capture of 15 British naval
personnel.


"They won a victory when they captured the hostages and they won
a victory when they released the hostages" on Wednesday, he said.


"I think they were testing British resolve in response to this
provocative act and I think they already had their answer, which
was that the British are not going to respond in a strong
fashion."


Regarding Iran's nuclear program, "if the choice is between an
Iran with nuclear weapons on the one hand, and a US military
strike to prevent that, then I think the choice is fairly
straight-forward," he said.


"Iran with nuclear weapons would be a threat in the region and a
threat globally."


The controversial Bolton left the UN post in January. He will be
replaced by the former US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad.
Washington is currently represented at the UN by acting
Ambassador Alejandro Wolff.
