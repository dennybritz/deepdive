AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi has leapt to the defence of
the club's under-fire Brazilian keeper Nelson Dida.


Italian media reports said the former Italian prime minister
blamed Dida for Bayern Munich's two goals in Tuesday's Champions
League quarter-final, first leg 2-2 draw at the San Siro.


But Berlsuconi insisted on Thursday that Dida was not at fault
for the two away goals, which mean AC Milan will be eliminated
from the competition unless they win or get a higher-scoring draw
in the return leg in Munich next week.


"I am dumbfounded by these reports that I have no confidence in
Dida," Berlusconi said on AC Milan's website.


"On the contrary. After the match I closely watched replays of
Bayern's goals and could only defend him. I wouldn't swap him for
any other goalkeeper."
