Three suspects were charged Thursday in connection with the July
7, 2005 suicide bombings in London which killed 52 commuters,
prosecutors and police said.


Their arrests last month were the first major detentions since
the bombings, in which near-simultaneous blasts caused
devastation on the London transport system during the morning
rush-hour.


The three men were involved in the "reconnaissance and planning"
of the attacks, in which four bombers blew themselves up on
underground trains and a bus, Scotland Yard said.


The three were charged that between November 1 and June 29, 2005
"they unlawfully and maliciously conspired ... to cause
explosions on the Transport for London system and/or tourist
attractions in London," prosecutors said.


The three were detained March 22 under the Terrorism Act 2000.


The four suicide bombers -- three of them Britons of Pakistani
origin and one a naturalised Jamaican -- all died when they set
off rucksack bombs on three Underground trains and a double-
decker bus.
