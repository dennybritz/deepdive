An initial report has been completed into why a Garuda Indonesia
jet crash- landed last month and erupted in flames, killing 21
people, an official said Thursday.


"The data collection is over and the preliminary report has been
finished," Tatang Kurniadi, the head of Indonesia's national
transport safety committee, told AFP.


It will take one to two months for a final draft to be published,
he said.


The Boeing jet landed at high speed in Yogyakarta on March 7,
slid off the runway and caught fire. Five Australians were among
the dead.


The airliner's black box cockpit voice recorder and data log have
been scoured for clues about the disaster. Survivors have said
the Boeing jet was travelling at a "crazy" speed when it landed.


The pilots, who were suspended after the crash, reportedly blamed
a strong gust of wind.


The Garuda crash was the second airliner disaster in Indonesia
this year. An Adam Air plane plunged into the sea off the island
of Sulawesi on New Year's Day in the earlier tragedy, killing all
102 on board.


Indonesia's government is trying to improve Indonesia's transport
safety record following a string of deadly plane and ferry
disasters.


It has devised a new assessment system in which no domestic
airline scores highly for safety, while others face closure
unless they improve.


Experts blame the recent death toll, on lax standards, old planes
and ships, and insufficient investment despite booming passenger
numbers.
