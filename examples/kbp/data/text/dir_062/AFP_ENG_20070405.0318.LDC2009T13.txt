Russia was condemned here on Thursday by the European human
rights court for violating the Church of Scientology's rights by
persistantly refusing it registration.


The Strasbourg-based court said Russian authorities had violated
two articles of the European Convention on Human Rights by
failing to register the Church in Moscow despite 11 applications
between 1998 and 2005.


The European Court of Human Rights awarded the Church of
Scientology in Moscow 10,000 euros (13,000 dollars) in damages,
as well as 15,000 euros for costs and expenses.


In its ruling it rejected the arguments put forward by Russian
courts as having no legal basis, especially over the need to
provide original documents for each new request for registration.


The court said "it had been the national courts' task to clarify
the applicable legal requirements and give the Church clear
instructions on how to prepare a complete and adequate
application."


The Scientology Church was founded in the United States in 1954
by science- fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard and was accorded the
status of religion there in 1993.


But it is regarded with suspicion in many European countries,
including France, Germany, Belgium and Greece, where opponents
accuse it of manipulating members for financial ends.


The Church of Scientology says it is working for a world free of
"war, crime and insanity". It is against psychiatry and anti-
drugs.


Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and John Travolta are among its
celebrity members.
