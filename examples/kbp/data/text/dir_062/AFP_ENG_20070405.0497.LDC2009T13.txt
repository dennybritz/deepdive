Russia's transport monitoring agency slapped restrictions on the
YUT Air company whose Tu-134 airplane crashed last month, killing
seven people, the agency said in a statement Thursday.


"Pilots of Tu-134 airplanes owned by YUT-Air that have
insufficient experience are banned from flights if clouds hang
lower than 80 meters (262 feet) and visibility on the landing
strip is less than 1,000 meters (3,280 feet)," the agency said.


"Also, training on a Tu-134 simulator in the aviation personnel
training center in Tyumen is suspended until investigation is
complete," the agency added.


A twin-engine Tupolev Tu-134 jet operated by regional airline
YUT-Air crashed as it landed in severe weather in Samara, 1,100
kilometres (685 miles) east of Moscow, breaking into pieces and
killing seven of the 57 passengers and crew aboard.


The crash followed 33 Russian aviation accidents last year that
left 318 dead -- a sixfold increase over 2005 -- according to a
report by the Interstate Aviation Committee, a joint group
involving former Soviet states.
