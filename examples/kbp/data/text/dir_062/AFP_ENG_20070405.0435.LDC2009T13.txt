French amateur Julien Guerrier had a nightmare start to his
Masters debut here on Thursday coming in with an 11-over par 83
which leaves him little prospect of surviving the cut.


The 21-year-old from la Rochelle qualified for the year's first
major and the first of his career by winning the British amateur
title last year, only the second Frenchman ever to do so in one
of golf's oldest tournaments.


He teed off with three-times former Masters winner Gary Player,
at 71, 50 years his senior, and local hope Vaughn Taylor.


But after hitting a perfect opening drive down the middle of the
1st fairway, he badly pulled his four-iron approach shot left and
long of the green as the adrenaline kicked in.


He chipped boldly from there, but was unable to hold his ball on
the lightning- fast green and watched it slowly slide off into
the front apron.


He took three more from there to walk away with a demoralising
double-bogey-six.


Guerrier bounced back with a birdie-four at the next, but a
double-bogey on the fifth and three bogeys in a row from the
seventh saw him reach the turn in six- over 42.


Two more bogeys followed at the 10th and 11th before a run of
three pars. But with the tough Augusta National course and a
stiff breeze taking a toll, he limped home with three straight
bogeys missing a six-footer for par at the last.


That gave him an 83, the same as Player.


"It was very difficult out there, very tough," he said.


"When you make a par here it feels like a birdie. On any other
course that would have been a 72 or a 74.


"I tried hard to enjoy it like everyone told me to do, but with a
score that high it's hard not to be disappointed.


"But Gary was great. We had a little matchplay of our own out
there. He's a great man"
