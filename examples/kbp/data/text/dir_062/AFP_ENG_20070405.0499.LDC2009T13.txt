The US radio station Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty announced
Thursday that one of its Iraqi correspondents had been found shot
dead in Baghdad.


"Iraqi journalist Khamail Khalaf, a reporter for Radio Free Iraq,
the Arabic language service of RFE/RL in Iraq, was found dead in
western Baghdad on April 5, 2007," said the statement.


Iraqi officials had told the station that she had been shot in
the head and that there were wounds to her body, said the
statement.


She had last been seen on Tuesday. Khamail had already received
threats in the past, said the statement.


She had been reporting for the station since 2004 on social and
cultural life in Iraq.


Also Thursday, a senior Iraqi journalist was killed when a
suicide truck bomb exploded outside a television channel's
headquarters in Baghdad, the leading Sunni political party that
owns the network said.


Deputy bureau chief Thaer Ahmed Jabr died after a suicide car
bomb attack followed by a gun attack on the offices, said a
statement from the Iraqi Islamic Party.


Another 12 employees of the 24-hour television channel were
wounded, some of them seriously, it added.
