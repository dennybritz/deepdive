Workers clearing out slot machines from an old casino in New
Jersey got an unexpected surprise when they discovered more than
17,000 dollars in loose change had fallen under the machines.


The Sands casino in Atlantic City closed in November to make way
for a new mega- casino. And while workers removing the old slot
machines expected to find the odd quarter, everyone was surprised
by the final haul of 17,193.34 dollars.


The booty -- which included coins, tokens and even a 100 dollar
bill -- was found under and between the more than 2,000 machines
and was mostly covered in years of dust and grime, The Press of
Atlantic City reported.


"Keep in mind that some of those machines had not been moved in
the 26 years that the Sands was in operation," Kim Townsend, from
Pinnacle Atlantic City, the company that now owns the casino,
told the newspaper.


"We expected to find some currency, but I think everyone was
amazed with the final amount."


Unfortunately for the workers, the casino operator does not
believe in "finders keepers." The company will keep the lion's
share, with the state of New Jersey taking an eight percent cut
of the loot in gaming tax.
