The organisers of the European Cup, the ERC, are to meet here at
their headquarters on April 11 and 12 to discuss the fallout from
the French and English clubs boycotting next season's tournament,
they announced on Thursday.


The ERC were reacting after both the French and then their
English counterparts carried out on Thursday their expected
threats to boycott next season's edition - ostensibly over the
English sport's govenring body, the RFU, not giving the clubs
shares in the competition.


"The ERC has taken note of the announcements following the
meeting of the National Rugby League (LNR) in Paris and the
subsequent statement from Premier Rugby," a statement read from
ERC.


"These decisions will be examined at the meeting of shareholders
and board members at the ERC headquarters in Dublin on April 11
and 12."
