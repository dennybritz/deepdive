Thursday's final preliminary heats for the Louis-Vuitton Cup were
cancelled because of the windy conditions, organisers said.


Act 13, which will now run till the reserve day of Saturday
instead of Friday as scheduled, is the final preliminary leg in
which Alinghi's 11 challengers gain bonus points ahead of the
Louis Vuitton Cup (April 16-May 7).


The Louis-Vuitton winner earns the right to take on champions
Alinghi in the 32nd America's Cup best-of-nine race match in
June.
