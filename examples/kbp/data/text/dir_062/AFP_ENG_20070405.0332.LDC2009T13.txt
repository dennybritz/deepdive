The major US share indexes opened weaker Thursday ahead of an
extended weekend break as the market awaited the release of a key
employment snapshot, traders said.


Analysts said trading could be languid ahead of Friday's release
of a nonfarm payrolls employment report for March with most
analysts predicting an acceleration in job growth last month.


In opening deals, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.03
points (0.20 percent) to 12,505.02 while the Nasdaq composite
lost 2.48 points (0.10 percent) to 2,456.21.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index declined 2.31
points (0.16 percent) to 1,437.06.


"The market is on a wait-and-see mode for the employment data
tomorrow," said Dick Green, a president at Briefing.com.


Most economists expect that March nonfarm payrolls swelled by
135,000 positions, after 97,000 new jobs were created in the
prior month.


The unemployment rate is expected to tick up a notch to 4.6
percent.


The US stock market will be closed Friday due to the Good Friday
holiday.
