Shares in German sportswear manufacturer Puma surged in trading
on the Frankfurt stock exchange on Thursday on the back of
rumours of a takeover by French luxury goods group PPR.


Shares were up 6.88 percent to 304.61 euros on the MDax market of
mid-sized companies which was showing an overall rise of 0.28
percent.


Traders in Frankfurt said Puma, the world number three in the
sportswear sector after Nike and Adidas, was the subject of
rumours that it could be a takeover target.


PPR, which owns a range of high-level brands including Yves St
Laurent and Gucci, declined to confirm or deny the rumours.
