The Luxembourg economy booked growth last year of 6.2 percent,
making the Grand Duchy one of best performing economies in the
eurozone, figures released Thursday by the Statec data agency
showed.


Luxembourg has not seen such strong growth since 2000, when the
economy surged ahead by 8.4 percent in a boom without precedent
in the tiny country.


Statec had initially estimated growth last year at 5.5 percent
but revised the figure upwards owing to the country's thriving
financial services industry, which generates a third of the
Luxembourg's gross domestic product.


In the final three months of 2006, output from financial and
business services grew by 8.3 percent while the industrial sector
saw an increase of 5.5 percent.


Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker's government has
forecast that growth will ease this year to 4.5 percent before
rising to 5.0 percent in 2008.
