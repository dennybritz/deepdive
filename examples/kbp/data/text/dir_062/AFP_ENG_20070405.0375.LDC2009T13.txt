Jose Reina has told Liverpool he is ready to commit his long-term
future to the Anfield club.


Spanish goalkeeper Reina believes Liverpool are on track for a
period of sustained success following the recent takeover by
sports tycoons Tom Hicks and George Gillett.


The American duo have promised Reds manager Rafa Benitez a 40
million pounds transfer kitty to help Liverpool sign a host of
top-class reinforcements for next season, giving Reina a clear
indication he is at the right club to fulfil his ambitions.


Reina is set to talk to the new owners about an extended deal and
he told Liverpool's website: "We will be speaking to the new
owners over the next few days, but I've said many times now I'm
really happy at Liverpool and I want to extend my contract.


"The key for any growing team is not only to improve with new
players, but also to make sure the key players and the spine of
the side stays together. Then you can build an even stronger team
around this. That spine is here at Liverpool.


"The project will be to build a team which is massive and can win
many things. The new owners have said before they make transfers
they first of all want to prepare new deals. Then I'm sure they
will think about the summer. At this moment, the future looks
brilliant.


"I've not met the owners yet, but I'm sure it will happen soon."
