Tokyo's election commission Thursday asked the popular video
sharing website YouTube to take off clips of candidates for the
local governor's race, saying it gave some of them unfair
advantages.


The election commission said it wanted to "ensure fairness" among
candidates ahead of Sunday's election in the world's largest
metropolis.


"We made the requests via e-mail and fax to the YouTube office in
the United States," said commission official Hiroyoshi Yone.


"The site has allowed only certain candidates' speeches to be
viewed freely on the site, with which we cannot ensure the
fairness of the election," he said.


But the commission has not received any reply from the operator
of the US website, he said.


Japanese election law limits the broadcasting of speeches, which
are aired only on public broadcaster NHK.


Soon after the race kicked off last month, the speech by one
fringe candidate, street musician Koichi Toyama, 36, has become a
popular attraction on YouTube due to his eccentric,
confrontational approach.


YouTube, which was bought in November by Google, has faced
trouble in Japan before.


In February, it agreed to post a copyright infringement warning
in Japanese under pressure from media and copyright protection
bodies.


This week Thailand's military-installed government banned YouTube
entirely after it failed to block a video considered insulting to
King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a revered figure in the country.
