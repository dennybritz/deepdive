Cypriot authorities on Thursday said they would crack down on
youths competing to build the largest traditional Easter bonfire
because of fears for public safety.


Police and the fire service now believe the tradition of burning
an effigy of Judas Iscariot on bonfires has got out of control,
with reports of children as young as 12 wielding chainsaws
illegally to fell trees for firewood.


The Bible says Judas was the disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ.


"Unfortunately an old custom has been turned into a competition
between youngsters from different neighbourhoods, posing a danger
to the children themselves, to homes and to vehicles," Nicosia
police chief Christakis Dionysiou told state radio.


Inspections of bonfire sites have been stepped up, and those
considered a public safety risk will be removed before Saturday
night's Greek Orthodox celebrations of Easter.


Where piles of wood cannot be cleared they will be drenched with
water to make them unburnable, he said.


The authorities say bonfire building should be supervised and
only within church grounds, as in the past.


Hundreds of bonfire sites now dot the eastern Mediterranean
holiday island, many of them guarded zealously by youngsters in
round-the-clock vigils to protect their handiwork.


"We will make every effort to prevent so-called 'lambratzies'
bonfires from being lit in dangerous locations, and I urge
parents to exercise extra control over their children in this,"
Dionysiou said.
