A 59-year-old man in Washington state on Thursday pleaded guilty
to pretending to be a decorated war-hero and officiating at
weddings, funerals and baptisms, federal prosecutors said.


Reggie Buddle faces up to six months in prison and a 5,000-dollar
fine after admitting a charge of unlawfully wearing US military
medals and decorations. He will be sentenced in June.


A statement from the prosecutors office said Buddle had admitted
repeatedly wearing a US Marine Corps uniform in 2005 and 2006,
despite never serving in the military.


He also wore medals such as the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Presidential Unit Citation, awarded for extraordinary heroism in
combat and the Vietnam Service Medal, available only to soldiers
who served in Vietnam.


Buddle also posed as a Marine Corps chaplain and reverend,
presiding and officiating at weddings, baptisms and funerals of
servicemen despite never being ordained.
