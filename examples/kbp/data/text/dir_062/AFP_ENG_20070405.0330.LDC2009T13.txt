A senior Turkish prosecutor rejected on Thursday calls for a
judicial investigation into Turkey's prime minister for allegedly
praising a Kurdish rebel leader.


Ankara's deputy chief prosecutor, Hikmet Onen, said he had not
found any "incriminating elements" in remarks made by Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan during an interview with an
Australian radio station seven years ago.


He also ruled that the interview in which Erdogan referred to
rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan as "Sayin" -- a word meaning
esteemed or honorable but which also doubles for "mister" -- fell
under the statute of limitations.


Several politicians from the country's main Kurdish party have
been indicted or jailed for referring to Ocalan as "Sayin". Under
the Turkish penal code, praising a crime or criminal offender is
punishable by up to two years in prison.


The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and several
individuals petitioned the prosecutor last week for the
investigation. Erdogan categorically rejected the allegations.


Ocalan is the head of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK), which has fought for Kurdish self-rule in the southeast
since 1984 in a conflict that has claimed more than 37,000 lives.


Considered by many as the country's public enemy number one, he
is serving a life sentence for treason and separatism as the sole
inmate on a prison island since being convicted in 1999.
