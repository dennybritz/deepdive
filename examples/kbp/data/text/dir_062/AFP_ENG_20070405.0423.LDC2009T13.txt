British police said Thursday they had arrested 10 youths
suspected of vandalising the Hogwarts Express, the steam train
used in the blockbuster Harry Potter films.


The train was attacked at a depot in Carnforth, northwest
England, on March 10 and had more than 230 windows smashed with
hammers.


"Ten youths have been arrested after 337 windows were smashed on
various trains," a spokesman for British Transport Police (BTP)
said.


"Ten males aged between 12 and 14, from Carnforth and surrounding
areas, have all been arrested in connection to the incident.


"They have been released on police bail pending further inquiries
to report back to BTP in the first week of May."


The Hogwarts Express ferries boy wizard Potter and his chums to
school in the popular movie series.


The damage will cost at least 50,000 pounds (74,000 euros, 98,000
dollars) to repair, the train's operator West Coast Railways has
said.


BTP and forensic experts spent several days combing the scene for
clues.


The train -- which is normally hired out for tourists and is used
by film company Warner Bros. for the Harry Potter movies -- was
attacked in 2003 when graffiti was sprayed on a carriage.


In October 2005, Harry Potter's flying car -- a pale blue 1962
Ford Anglia -- mysteriously disappeared from a film set in
Cornwall, southwest England. It was found in May last year in a
nearby ruined castle.
