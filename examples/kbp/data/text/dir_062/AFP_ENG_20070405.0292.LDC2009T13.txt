Three suspects were charged Thursday in connection with the July
7, 2005 suicide bombings in London which killed 52 commuters,
police said.


The three men were involved in the "reconnaissance and planning"
of the attacks, in which four bombers blew themselves up on
underground trains and a bus, Scotland Yard said.
