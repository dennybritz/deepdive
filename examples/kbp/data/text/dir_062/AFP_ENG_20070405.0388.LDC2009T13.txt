Talk about burying the past. A New York divorcee has come up with
a solution for failed marriages -- a miniature coffin to lay
those unwanted wedding rings to rest.


"Give a dead marriage its proper, final resting place," the
company offering the miniature caskets says on its website.


"The Wedding Ring Coffin is the perfect gift for yourself or a
loved one for bringing closure after a divorce. It's time to bury
the past and move on to a new tomorrow," it says.


The 15 by five centimeter (six by two inch) solid wood coffin has
a black velvet ring insert, a choice of six brass plaques
inscribed with messages including "I do NOT!" and "Six feet isn't
deep enough," and costs 30 dollars.


"It's a way to acknowledge the death of a marriage and to
physically and symbolically close the lid on that chapter of your
life," Jill Testa, who came up with the idea, told the New York
Post.


"Most people just stick their rings in the bottom of their
jewelry box, in a corner of a sock or underwear drawer," added
Testa, who surprisingly describes her own divorce after 20 years
of marriage as amicable.


Her company, Wedding Ring Coffin, even offers cards inviting
people to join in your marriage wake, featuring the slogan:
"You're invited to my divorce party. Join me as I close the lid
on my marriage."
