Argentine football legend Diego Maradona, who has battled drug
and alcohol problems for years, now plans to clean up his act,
his doctor said Thursday.


"I see in him the intention to rehabilitate himself soon," said
Hector Pezzella, director of the Guemes clinic in Buenos Aires
where Maradona, 46, has been for a week with hepatitis caused by
alcohol.


"He knows that checking in is for the best," Pezzella told
reporters.


He said the former captain of the Argentine squad was under
sedation to avoid alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and so family
visits were limited to his former wife, Claudia Villafane,
daughters Dalma and Giannina and a few others.


The doctor said that the alcohol withdrawal episodes were less
frequent and Maradona was improving since he was admitted on
March 28.


Maradona has been called one of the greatest players of the last
century but his career on and off the pitch has been marred by
repeated drug and alcohol abuse. He retired from professional
football in 1997.


He has suffered from chronic hepatitis since he contracted
hepatitis B in 1991, while he played for Barcelona.


He suffered a heart attack in 2004 following a cocaine overdose,
and has sought treatment in Switzerland and Cuba.
