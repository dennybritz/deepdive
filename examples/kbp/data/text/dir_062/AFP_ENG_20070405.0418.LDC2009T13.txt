US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is to discuss the
humanitarian crisis in Darfur on a visit to Sudan, Chad, Libya
and Mauritania next week, US officials said Thursday.


"Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte will travel to Sudan, Chad,
Libya and Mauritania April 11 to the 19," State Department
spokesman Sean McCormack said.


"The focus of the trip will be the crisis in Darfur and efforts
to achieve peace in Sudan through implementation of the Darfur
peace agreement and the comprehensive peace agreement."


The western Sudanese region is the scene of ongoing crisis
despite these agreements, signed by the Khartoum government with
two separate rebel groups.


They aimed to end a conflict that broke out in 2003 when rebels
from minority tribes took up arms to demand an equal share of
national resources. The uprising prompted a brutal crackdown by
Khartoum and its Arab proxy militia, the Janjaweed, against black
ethnic groups.


Some 200,000 people have been killed and more than two million
driven from their homes, according to the United Nations, which
has reported widespread human rights abuses in Darfur.


The crisis has spilled over Darfur's western border. Reports of
inter-ethnic violence in neighboring Chad and the Central African
Republic have prompted US officials to warn of a new humanitarian
crisis in these areas.


Sudan also borders Libya to the northwest.
