Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"If there was any chance of Greg continuing as coach of India, it
probably disappeared when Bob Woolmer was murdered during the
World Cup. Such an ugly incident is sure to focus your
concentration on life's priorities. Greg is probably better off
without all the angst that comes with one of the most demanding
jobs in cricket."


- Ian Chappell on his brother's decision to quit as India coach


"It's a big game. But not many people gave us much hope of
turning up and putting Sri Lanka under pressure. We'll try to do
the same on Sunday and hopefully get the two points."


- England captain Michael Vaughan remains optimistic of his
team's chances of beating Australia on Sunday.


"I don't want to play this kind of cricket."


- Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene on his team's last-ball,
two-run win over England.


"It could put us back a little bit if it was to rain and we were
to share the points with Ireland."


- New Zealand Ross Taylor on the torrential downpours which have
affected preparations in Guyana.


"We don't want to finish at the bottom. We were not last in the
whole tournament, but we are now at the bottom in the Super
Eights."


- Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore keen to avoid the wooden spoon.
