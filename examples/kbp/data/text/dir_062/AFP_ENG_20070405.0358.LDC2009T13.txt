Russia's health minister is to be fired, a top parliamentarian
predicted on Thursday, following widespread criticism of his
handling of medicine shortages that have hit poor patients across
the country.


"I promise that (Mikhail) Zurabov will not be a minister," said
Boris Gryzlov, the speaker of Russia's lower house, news agency
Interfax reported.


Parliament cannot fire a minister, but Gryzlov, a confidant of
President Vladimir Putin, added: "If I am saying it, I know what
I'm saying."


On Wednesday the unpopular health minister was sharply criticised
by deputies over an ongoing crisis restricting access to
government-supplied free medicines.


The newspaper Novaya Gazeta recently reported a "catastrophic
lack of medicine" in towns and cities across the country.
