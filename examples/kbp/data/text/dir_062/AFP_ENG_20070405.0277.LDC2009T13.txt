Manchester United chiefs accused Italian police of a "severe
over-reaction" after they baton-charged supporters of the
Premiership club during their Champions League defeat at Roma.


United and Roma fans were involved in fighting outside the
Olympic Stadium before Wednesday's game and riot police used
batons and tear gas to subdue the visiting supporters when fresh
disturbances erupted during the quarter-final first leg, which
ended in a 2-1 victory for the Italian side.


Thirteen United fans were hospitalised, one with a stab wound to
the neck, as a result of the violence before and during the match
and UEFA, European football's governing body, have announced they
will investigate.


United are furious with the police's behaviour at the stadium and
they insist fans were attacked regardless of whether or not they
had been involved in fighting.


The English club admit they are powerless to take action against
the police, but they want supporters to submit statements to help
a governement investigation into the trouble.


A statement on United's website said: "The distressing scenes
witnessed in the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night shocked
everyone at Old Trafford.


"In what the Club views as a severe over-reaction, local police
handed out indiscriminate beatings to United supporters.


"In these circumstances, neither Manchester United nor AS Roma is
able to call the police to account.


"As a result, the Club warmly welcomes the Government examination
of the incident and will collect witness statements from fans to
submit to the Home Office."
