American aircraft carrier the USS John C. Stennis has returned to
the North Arabian Sea after taking part in manoeuvres in the
Gulf, the US Fifth Fleet said on Thursday.


The carrier group left on Wednesday to resume missions in
Operation Enduring Freedom and provide close air power support
and reconnaissance to International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF) troops on the ground in Afghanistan, it said.


"Carrier aircraft provide close air power support and deliver
ordnance on enemy positions designated by ground forces," the
statement added.


The US Navy recently staged major war games in the Gulf with two
carriers for the first time since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, at a
time of heightened tension with Iran over the 15 detained British
naval personnel who were released on Wednesday.


The manoeuvres involved the Stennis and the USS Dwight D.
Eisenhower and their battle groups.
