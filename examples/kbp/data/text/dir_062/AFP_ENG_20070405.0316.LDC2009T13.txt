Britain's manufactured output unexpectedly dropped by 0.6 percent
in February from the January figure, marking the strongest
decline since October 2005, official data showed on Thursday.


The data was released ahead of a decision by the Bank of England
to keep British interest rates at 5.25 percent.


Analysts' consensus forecast had been for an output rise in
February of 0.3 percent. Manufactured output accounts for 14.7
percent of the British economy.


The drop is the second in a row following January's 0.2 percent
decline.


The last time output fell in consecutive months was in late 2005.


On a 12-month basis, manufactured output climbed 1.2 percent in
February, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, below
market expectations of a 2.2-percent increase.


Twelve of the 13 sub-sectors showed decreases in output between
February and January.


"Within the widespread falls seen on the month there was a
significant decrease in the transport equipment industries where
output fell by 1.3 percent," the ONS said.


The wider industrial production measure, which accounts for
around 18.6 percent of British gross domestic product, fell by
0.2 percent in February from January.


On a year-on-year basis, industrial production was 0.3-percent
higher.
