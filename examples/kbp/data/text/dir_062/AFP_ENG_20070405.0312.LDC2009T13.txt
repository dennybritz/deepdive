The French government said Thursday it was stepping up security
to prevent a possible terrorist attack during the presidential
election this month.


"France is under threat from a number of fundamentalist
organisations and we must remain extrarordinarily vigilant,"
Interior Minister Francois Baroin said, announcing extra security
at all candidate rallies and party headquarters.


Police said Thursday that anti-terrorism police have opened an
investigation after death threats were made against the right-
wing presidential frontrunner Nicolas Sarkozy.


The probe began on Monday after a television employee and
official from the opposition Socialist Party received e-mail
messages that read "Attack on Sarkozy, Lyon, April 5 2007."


Police have stepped up the security detail for Sarkozy, the
candidate of the governing UMP party, who is due to travel
Thursday to France's second city of Lyon for an election rally.


Sarkozy narrowly leads the race for the presidential election,
taking place in two rounds on April 22 and May 6.


France has been singled out as a target by the Algerian Salafist
Group for Preaching and Combat, which recently changed its name
to the Al-Qaeda Organisation in the Lands of Islamic North
Africa.


The country's national terror alert level is currently at "red",
the third highest on a four-colour scale, with military patrols
deployed in airports and main rail terminals.
