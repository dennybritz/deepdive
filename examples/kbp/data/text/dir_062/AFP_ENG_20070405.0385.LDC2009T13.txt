French rugby union clubs confirmed their boycott of next season's
European Cup, the French National League (LNR) president Serge
Blanco announced on Thursday.


They are likely to be followed by English clubs as they had
announced earlier in the week that if French sides went through
with their threat they would also not play in next season's
tournament.


Both the French and the English have claimed that they share the
same reason for the boycott - the Rugby Football Union (RFU)
granting English clubs equal shareholding in the European Cup.


However many in the RFU, including director of rugby Rob Andrew,
share the view that the French are using it as a smokescreen and
their real reason is fixture congestion following the World Cup
which they are hosting in September and October.


The sport's governing body the IRB had told AFP back in January
they had offered to allow the French to conduct their
championship during the World Cup - which they normally don't
permit - but it had been flatly turned down because the
broadcaster of domestic rugby did not want them to play during
the global showpiece as they would be missing a lot of star
players.
