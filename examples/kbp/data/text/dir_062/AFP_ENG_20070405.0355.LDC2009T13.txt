A senior Iraqi journalist was killed on Thursday when a suicide
truck bomb exploded outside a television channel's headquarters,
the leading Sunni political party that owns the network said.


"The Baghdad TV headquarters was targeted by a cowardly car bomb
attack followed by a gun attack, killing deputy bureau chief the
journalist Thaer Ahmed Jabr," the Iraqi Islamic Party said in a
statement.


Another 12 employees of the 24-hour television channel were
wounded, some of them seriously, it added.


An Iraqi security official had said earlier that 10 Baghdad TV
employees were wounded when a suicide bomber blew up a dump truck
outside its offices in the capital's western Al-Jamiyah district.


"Since its establishment, the channel has been committed to a
moderate national line and has always defended Iraqi citizens,
regardless of their religious affiliation," the Islamic Party
added.


One of the party's leaders, Sunni moderate Tareq al-Hashemi, is
one of the country's two vice presidents.


At least 155 media workers, 95 percent of them Iraqi, have been
killed in Iraq in the four years since the 2003 US-led invasion.
