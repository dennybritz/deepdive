US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Daniel Fried
on Thursday welcomed Croatian efforts to get closer to NATO and
said the country should be invited to join the alliance in 2008.


Fried stressed that Croatia "by its efforts and undertaken
reforms has deserved to be invited to join NATO next year," a
statement issued after his meeting with President Stipe Mesic
said.


The United States "firmly supports Croatia on its path towards
full-fledged membership in Euro-Atlantic integrations," Fried
said quoted by the statement.


Mesic has labeled Croatia's membership in the European Union as
the Balkan country's "strategic goals."


Efforts are being made to inform the public about advantages of
NATO membership, he added.


A large majority of Croatians are against their country becoming
a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. According to
the most recent opinion polls, only around a third of the
country's population supports the idea.


In mid-2006, the government pledged to raise public support for
NATO membership.
