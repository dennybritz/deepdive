The Supreme Court of Canada rejected Thursday a bid by the first
Canadian indicted under a gutted terrorism law to quash the
charges against him.


Mohammed Momin Khawaja, 27, was charged under Canada's new Anti-
Terrorism Act after his arrest in March 2004. The software
developer was linked to a anti- terror sweep in Britain said to
have averted a major bomb attack.


He asked Canada's high court to have the charges against him
dropped after another tribunal struck down a portion of the act
that defines terrorism in October.


As usual, the court gave no explanation for its decision.


The case is now expected to proceed to trial in May.


Canada's controversial anti-terrorism law was enacted three
months after the September 11, 2001 attacks that killed nearly
3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.


In October, a Canadian judge struck down a portion of the act
that defines terrorism, saying it infringes on constitutional
"freedoms of conscience and religion; thought, belief, opinion
and expression and of association."


But instead of releasing Khawaja, the judge granted the
government one year to amend the act while allowing the
prosecution for aiding a terrorist group and facilitating
terrorist activity to continue.


Meanwhile, a London jury entered its third week of deliberations
Monday in the case of seven British Muslims accused of plotting
to detonate bombs around the city in 2004, according to reports.


Khawaja is accused of making detonators for the bombs at his
Ottawa home, but was not charged in Britain.
