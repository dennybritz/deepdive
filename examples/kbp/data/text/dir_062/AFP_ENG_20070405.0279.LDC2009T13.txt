The price of nickel struck an all-time high of 50,000 dollars per
tonne in London trading on Thursday owing to falling stockpiles
of the base metal, traders said.


It was the highest reading for nickel since the start of its
quotation on the London Metal Exchange (LME) in 1979. Nickel is
used to help prevent corrosion.


"If there are any worries about slowing US and or global growth
then they are not apparent from the performance of the base
metals market, at least not over the past few days," UBS analyst
Robin Bhar said.


"Although further gains are possible we suspect prices (at these
levels) are unsustainable," he added.


The price of nickel has surged 50 percent since the start of 2007
and tripled in one year. Later Thursday, the price of a tonne of
nickel for delivery in three months stood at 49,450 dollars.


Following the record high, profit-taking was expected ahead of
the Easter break, traders said.


Stockpiles of nickel have shrunk to about 5,000 tonnes on the
LME, equivalent to about one day's worth of global demand. LME
stocks stood at more than 32,000 tonnes a year ago, in part owing
to global supply disruptions.
