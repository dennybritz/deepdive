The European single currency surged past 1.34 dollars on Thursday
to strike the highest level since March 14, 2005.


At around 1330 GMT, the euro rose as high as 1.3435 dollars,
compared with 1.3369 dollars in earlier European trading.


The US currency had been hit overnight by soft economic data,
while the euro has been buoyed in recent weeks by positive
economic news, analysts said.


"It's a move that's been building up for some time," said Ian
Stannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas.


He added that "the data from Europe was continuing to come on the
strong side" in contract with the "mixed" data flow in the United
States.


Foreign exchange market participants meanwhile are awaiting
publication of key US jobs data on Friday after disappointing
service sector figures in the world's largest economy, dealers
said.
