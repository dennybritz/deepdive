The Greek coast guard on Thursday mounted a large rescue
operation to retrieve some 1,200 travellers from a cruise boat
that was sinking after it ran aground near the Aegean Sea island
of Santorini, the merchant marine ministry said.


The 143-metre (472-foot) boat operated by Cyprus-based Louis
Hellenic Cruise Lines, the Sea Diamond, ran aground one nautical
mile off the shores of Santorini and was reportedly taking on
water.


"The boat was attempting to moor but ran aground in shallow
waters," a local boatman told private Antenna television.


"Weather conditions are good, but the ship is taking on water and
has listed heavily," he added.


The passengers on board, mainly from the United States and
Germany, were abandoning ship, news reports said.


A Super Puma rescue helicopter was dispatched to the scene, along
with patrol boats from the surrounding area.


The Sea Diamond was launched in 1986, and was renovated nearly a
decade ago. It has a crew of 400.


Louis Hellenic Cruise Lines operates several cruises to Greece
and the Greek Islands.
