Two of four British service personnel killed with their
interpreter in southern Iraq Thursday were women, the defence
ministry said.


The pair were from the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps
and the Intelligence Corps. Their deaths bring to four the number
of British female personnel killed since the start of the US-led
invasion in March 2003.


Overall, 140 British servicemen and women have died since
hostilities began.


"It is with deep regret that we can confirm that four British
servicemen and women and a local civilian interpreter were killed
in a roadside bomb attack against a Warrior patrol west of Basra
this morning," a ministry statement said.


"The soldiers were from the Intelligence Corps, the Queen
Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, the Royal Army Medical
Corps and 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.


"Next of kin have been informed and have requested a 24-hour
period before further details are released."


The last British woman to die in Iraq was Staff Sergeant Sharron
Elliott, 34, from the Intelligence Corps, who was killed with
three on November 12 last year in an attack on a routine patrol
on the Shatt al-Arab waterway in Basra.


The first British woman to die was Flight Lieutenant Sarah-Jayne
Mulvihill, 32, whose helicopter was shot down over Basra on May
6, 2006. Four others were killed.


Prime Minister Tony Blair said earlier Thursday the latest deaths
were killed "as a result of a terrorist act".
