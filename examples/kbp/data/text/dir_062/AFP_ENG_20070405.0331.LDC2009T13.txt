The 15 British service personnel held captive in Iran arrived
back at a military base in southwest England on Thursday to be
debriefed and reunited with their families.


The sailors arrived at Royal Marines Base Chivenor, near
Barnstaple in north Devon in two Royal Air Force Sea King
helicopters.


They had switched to the helicopters at London's Heathrow
airport, where they flew in on a British Airways flight from
Tehran.


The Royal Navy personnel and Royal Marines were to undergo
medical checks and a full de-briefing before finally being
allowed to see their relatives.
