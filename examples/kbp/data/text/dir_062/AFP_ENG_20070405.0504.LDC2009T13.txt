The coalition of parties supporting Benin's President Boni Yayi
was leading in parliamentary elections with over 93 percent of
the vote counted, the central election commission said Thursday.


The coalition of some 20 parties backing Yayi, Cauri Forces, was
in lead with 22.5 percent of the vote, followed by the Alliance
for Dynamism and Democracy (ADD) of former president Necephore
Soglo at 16.9 percent.


Saturday's election is being viewed as a political yardstick for
Yayi a year after he took office pledging to fight corruption.
