A government-backed security watchdog for sporting events in
Italy ruled Thursday that Catania's high-risk Serie A match
against Roma must be played behind closed doors.


The game is taking place on neutral ground at Lecce's Via Del
Mare stadium as part of punishment handed to Catania after a
policeman was killed during crowd violence in February.


On Wednesday a civil court ruled that Catania fans would be
allowed into neutral venues.


But the National Observer for Sporting Events has overuled the
decision for the Roma match given the reputation of the two sets
of fans for causing trouble.


"The match is considered high risk and therefore will be played
behind closed doors, it said in a statement.


The ban on fans comes a day after Roma and Manchester United
supporters clashed before and during a highly-charged Champions
League quarter-final, first leg at Rome's Olympic stadium.


Thirteen United fans were hospitalised, one with a stab wound to
the neck.


Catania were banned from staging matches at their Massimino
stadium following the riot at the Sicilian derby against Palermo
two months ago.
