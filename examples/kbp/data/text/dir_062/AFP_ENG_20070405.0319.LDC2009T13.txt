Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has accepted the resignation
of his justice minister and named an acting replacement, his
office said on Thursday.


"Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has decided to accept the
resignation of Justice Minister Hashim al-Shibli," a statement
said.


"Doctor Safa al-Safi, minister of state for parliamentary
affairs, has been authorised to become acting justice minister,"
it added.


Shibli told AFP on Saturday he was resigning over differences
with the Iraqi National List, the political grouping he
represents in parliament, as well as with the coalition
government.


The Iraqi National List, which is headed by former prime minister
Ayad Allawi, is a secular nationalist alliance made up of Sunnis
and Shiites. It has 25 seats in the 275-member parliament.


The acting justice minister belongs to the same United Iraqi
Alliance grouping of conservative Shiites as Maliki. It is the
biggest collection of parties and independents in parliament,
controlling 128 seats.


On March 4, the prime minister said he expected to reshuffle his
39-member coalition cabinet of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds within
two weeks, although it was unclear whether Shibli had been due to
loose his job.
