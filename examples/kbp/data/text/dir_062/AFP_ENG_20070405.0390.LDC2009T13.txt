More than 100 protesters began a hunger strike on Thursday
outside Kyrgyzstan's parliament building in a push for new
elections ahead of mass demonstrations set for next week.


The hunger strikers, who built traditional yurt tents outside
parliament, say President Kurmanbek Bakiyev has failed to follow
through on promises of economic and democratic reform made during
a 2005 uprising that brought him to power.


Opposition members also accuse him of corruption and
mismanagement.


A protest organiser, Beknazar Urumov, said he and five others
were ready to set themselves on fire if the president does not
act.


Mass demonstrations are planned to begin on Monday in provincial
cities and on Wednesday in the capital of Bishkek.


Last week, Bakiyev appointed a moderate opposition figure, Almaz
Atambayev, to the prime minister's post in a bid to win over
critics.


But the opposition continues to demand elections, constitutional
reforms and the formation of a coalition government.


Bakiyev, whose mandate runs until 2010, has ruled out early
presidential elections, although he said recently that he might
agree to hold a referendum on his leadership later this year.


The country has experienced continued instability, including
demonstrations and the killings of three members of parliament,
since the 2005 uprising.


The central Asian state, a former Soviet republic which borders
China, is seen by outside powers as strategic. It hosts separate
Russian and US airbases a few kilometres (miles) apart.
