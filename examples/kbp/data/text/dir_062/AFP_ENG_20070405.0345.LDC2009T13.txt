Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said Thursday that ministers from
Iraq, neighbouring countries and other leading powers will meet
early May to discuss the turmoil in his war-ravaged country.


The ministerial meeting will be held "in the early part of May,"
Zebari told AFP by telephone.


The talks would be a "follow-up of the recent Baghdad meeting
which ended on a promising note," he added.


"At this stage I do not want to reveal all my cards... about the
venue, the countries... we will make an announcement in the next
couple of days," said Zebari, a Kurd in Iraq's Shiite-led
government.


Turkey said Wednesday it was awaiting Baghdad's consent to host a
gathering in Istanbul of leading powers, including the United
States, to discuss ways and means to stabilise Iraq.


The proposed meeting aims to bring together foreign ministers of
Iraq, its neighbours and the five permanent members of the UN
Security Council as well as the Group of Eight industrialised
nations.


A prior meeting at ambassador level in Baghdad last month saw the
then US ambassador in Iraq hold direct talks with Iranian
officials, marking the highest level contact between the two foes
in more than four years.


Next month's ministerial meeting could see US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice sit alongside her counterparts from Iran and
Syria, which Washington accuses of fuelling the insurgency in
Iraq. Both countries deny the charge.
