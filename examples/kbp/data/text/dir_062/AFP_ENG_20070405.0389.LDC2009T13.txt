US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice does not rule out a
bilateral meeting with her Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki
on the sidelines of an international conference on Iraq in early
May, spokesman Sean McCormack said.


"We have said from the begining when this first surfaced that if
there would be a ministerial conference, that we are not going to
exclude any particular diplomatic interaction," McCormack said.


"If there is an issue that she thinks is important to raise, for
example Iranian behavior concerning the supply of deadly material
for the EFDs networks, of course she is going to take the
opportunity to raise that. But that would be up to her based on
the situation," he added.
