Some of the 15 British naval personnel detained by Iran for
nearly two weeks may have been left in solitary confinement while
there, a military officer said Thursday.


"There were times when they were left alone, but we will not go
into any further detail until tomorrow," Lieutenant Colonel Andy
Price said.


The eight Royal Navy sailors and seven marines were enjoying food
and drinks after having been reunited with their families in
Britain after the 13-day ordeal. They are due to undergo a
medical on Friday morning.


The 14 men and one woman flew home Thursday after their release.


A military spokesman, meanwhile, said that some of the group "are
very buoyant and upbeat while others are more emotional. They
haven't slept for 36 hours."


They were seized in the northern Gulf on March 23, accused of
violating Iran's territorial waters, while carrying out what
London said was "routine" anti- smuggling operations.
