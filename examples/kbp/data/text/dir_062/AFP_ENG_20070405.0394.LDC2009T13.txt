The Romanian Constitutional Court on Thursday cleared President
Traian Basescu, facing an opposition motion to impeach him, of
claims he had violated the constitution.


The court said that the claims against Basescu "do not represent
serious violations of the constitution, liable to lead to his
suspension by parliament."


"It's for parliament to decide on the rest" of this matter, the
court, which has an advisory role, said.


Last month, a parliamentary inquiry committee concluded in a
report that Basescu had committed 19 serious violations of the
constitution.


It accused the president of showing a "partisan attitude and
abandoning his role as a political mediator," as well as of
"contributing to creating an atmosphere of political
instability."


The committee had been set up in February to "find additional
arguments" to support a motion filed by the opposition two weeks
earlier to impeach Basescu.


By law, following the constitutional court's decision, a request
for the president's impeachment must go to a parliamentary vote,
where it needs the backing of 50 percent of votes, plus one, from
the 469 deputies and senators to be adopted.


A referendum must then be held within 30 days. Basescu however
enjoys strong popularity and anaylsts predict that if a vote took
place it would end in failure for the president's opponents.
