Indian movie-maker Mani Ratnam on Thursday defended his latest
biopic "Guru" for its sympathetic portrayal of a tycoon who
doesn't hesitate to break the law to reap profit.


Some reviewers interpreted the film as justifying the use of
unfair tactics, so long as it creates shareholder wealth.


Ratnam, in Bangalore to attend an industry conference on the need
for ethics in business, accepted that the Gurukant Desai, played
by Abhishek Bachchan, is morally ambiguous.


"Yeah, but that's the protagonist's point of view," the 50-year-
old director said, visibly bristling. "... doesn't mean you have
to follow it.


"I am just saying there's somebody, who believed in a particular
fashion, who lived in a particular fashion -- that's his kismet.


"If you are making a film about a particular person, you have to
get into his shoes," said Ratnam.


Critics have drawn parallels between Dhirubhai Ambani, who
founded the giant conglomerate Reliance Industries that enriched
millions of shareholders and died in July 2002, and Desai.


Like Ambani, Desai is born in the western Indian state of Gujarat
to a schoolmaster, goes abroad to work in the oil business and
returns home after 10 years to start his own company with 15,000
rupees of seed capital.


Desai doesn't hesistate to cut corners as he goes on to build his
business, the Shakti Group, into one of the country's biggest
companies.


Ratnam has however denied basing the story on Ambani's life.


The climax has Desai, recovering after a paralytic stroke,
justifying to a court numerous breaches of the law to build his
Shakti Group by pointing to the wealth he created for people.


The court finds Desai him guilty of two minor violations.


Guru, released in January, has been declared a box-office hit and
a career- defining movie for Bachchan.
