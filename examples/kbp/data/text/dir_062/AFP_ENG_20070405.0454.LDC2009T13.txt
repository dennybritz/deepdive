Wall Street shares ended higher Thursday, following a listless
morning session, after billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian
unveiled a 4.5-billion-dollar takeover bid for the troubled
Chrysler car group.


Kerkorian's personal holding company Tracinda Corp. said in a
statement the offer would aim to "build and strengthen Chrysler
as an independent entity." The car-maker, which has been
struggling to maintain sales, is currently controlled by German-
based DaimlerChrysler.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 29.66 points (0.24
percent) at 12,559.71 just after the closing bell, while the
Nasdaq composite finished 12.65 points (0.51 percent) higher at
2,471.34.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index ended up 4.37
points (0.30 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,443.74.


Kerkorian, a casino mogul, was previously a major shareholder in
Chrysler and he indicated his firm would reshape Chrysler "by
partnering with the United Auto Workers and senior management of
Chrysler."


Traders meanwhile said they were girding for the release Friday
of a key employment snapshot although the market will be closed
for the Good Friday holiday.
