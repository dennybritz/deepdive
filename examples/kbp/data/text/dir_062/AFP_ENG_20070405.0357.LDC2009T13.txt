Zimbabwe seamer Anthony Ireland, who quit international cricket
after his team's first round World Cup exit, has joined English
county Gloucestershire on a two- year contract.


The 22-year-old, who played 26 one-day internationals, played for
Gloucestershire 2nd XI in 2006.


"I'm really glad to be playing for Gloucestershire. I firmly
believe that the intensity of the first class game in England
will improve my cricket quickly and I can't wait to get started,"
said Ireland.


Gloucestershire coach Mark Alleyne said: "We are excited Anthony
can now join us after featuring in the 2nd XI last year. He is
going to add significant depth to the bowling department and we
look forward to his immense contribution."
