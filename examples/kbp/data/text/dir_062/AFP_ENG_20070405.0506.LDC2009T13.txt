The so-called Mediterranean diet, famous for protecting against
heart problems, also appears to protect against respiratory
allergies among children, according to a Greek study published on
Thursday.


Researchers assessed the health and eating habits among 690
children aged seven to 18 in rural Crete.


Those who ate high levels of fresh fruit and vegetables --
grapes, oranges, apples and fresh tomatoes -- and nuts were less
likely to suffer from asthmatic wheezing and allergic rhinitis
than counterparts with a low intake.


The paper appears in Thorax, published by the British Medical
Association.
