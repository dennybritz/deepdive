A UN war crimes tribunal said Thursday it had transferred the
case of two Bosnian Serb cousins accused of atrocities to a court
in Bosnia-Hercegovina.


Milan Lukic faces 21 charges of crimes against humanity and war
crimes for the alleged killings of Muslims in the Bosnian town of
Visegrad during the 1992-95 war.


Lukic and his cousin, Sredoje Lukic, are accused of forming a
paramilitary unit that worked with police and military units "in
exacting a reign of terror upon the local Muslim population." The
group was called "The White Eagles" and "The Avengers."


Lukic was extradited from Argentina last year after five years on
the run.


A Belgrade court has already sentenced Lukic in absentia to 20
years in prison for war crimes, kidnapping, torture and the
killing of 16 Muslims in October 1992 in the Serbian town of
Sjeverin.


The UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia attempts to transfer as many cases as possible to
local jurisdictions.


So far nine cases have been sent to Bosnia-Hercegovina, two have
been transferred to Croatia and one has gone to Serbia.
