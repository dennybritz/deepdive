Six German Tornado aircraft arrived Thursday in Afghanistan where
they will fly surveillance missions in support of NATO-led troops
battling Taliban rebels, the alliance said.


The jets, which left Jagel in northern Germany on Monday, touched
down in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif where they
will be based, the NATO-led International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) said.


"All the six Tornados arrived today in Mazar-i-Sharif as
expected. Everything went well," Captain Alexander Von Heimann, a
spokesman for the German ISAF contingent, told AFP.


The planes are accompanied by 200 personnel and 600 tonnes of
supplies.


While they will be based with Germany's 2,750 troops in northern
Afghanistan, the jets will mainly fly over the violence-hit south
to supply ISAF forces with aerial images of Taliban positions.


The twin-seated, double-engine Tornados will not be used for
combat operations, German military officials said. The planes are
expected to start their mission at the weekend, they said.


German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has so far
resisted pressure from its NATO allies to deploy troops in the
south.


According to an AFP tally based on reports, more than 900 people,
about two- thirds of them militants, have died so far this year
in violence linked to the Islamist Taliban, who were ousted by
US-led forces in late 2001.
