Top Indian defence officials flew Thursday to Pakistan for fresh
talks on demilitarisation of an icy glacier in Kashmir where
freezing temperatures have claimed more lives than actual combat.


India insists that "iron-clad" evidence of Pakistani military
positions on the 6,300-metre (20,800-feet) Siachen area of the
disputed region is needed before demilitarisation of the world's
highest battlefield can begin.


Indian Defence Secretary Shekhar Dutt led a nine-member team to
the talks with his newly appointed Pakistani counterpart, Kamran
Rasool, in Islamabad, Indian defence ministry officials said.


Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier on Thursday called a
meeting of his security cabinet to chalk out a framework for the
two-day talks which begin Friday, they said.


"The cabinet brief given to the defence secretary is clear-cut on
the issue of India's position on the need for an authentication
of (Pakistani) troops positions on the Siachen," a delegation
member said before leaving New Delhi.


Pakistan, which claims all of Kashmir, fears that setting out its
positions would be tacit acceptance of India's claims to Siachen
and the area as a whole.


The two countries have fought two of their three wars over
Kashmir.


India and Pakistan, which fought a fierce skirmish on Siachen in
1987, have held several rounds of discussions on the glacier
since the resumption of peace talks between two nuclear-armed
south Asian rivals in January 2004.
