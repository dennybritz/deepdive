A US Congress delegation met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Thursday to discuss further Egyptian involvement in efforts to
solve the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region.


The 25-strong delegation of Democrats and Republicans, headed by
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, met Mubarak in the Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.


"We discussed with President Mubarak the role he can play in this
matter, for a peaceful resolution of the crisis," Hoyer told
reporters after the meeting.


He said the delegation had just returned from a trip to Darfur
and talks in Khartoum with government officials.


According to the United Nations, at least 200,000 people have
been killed in Darfur and more than two million displaced since
the conflict erupted in February 2003. Some sources say the death
toll is much higher.


The regime of Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir stands accused of
genocide by Washington for its repression of the four-year
rebellion in Darfur.


International pressure has so far failed to obtain Khartoum's
green light for the deployment of Unite Nations peacekeepers to
replace an embattled African Union contingent in the war-torn
western region.


Egypt, which has strong ties and shares access to Nile waters
with Sudan, recently spoke out against imposing further sanctions
on Khartoum over Darfur.
