The Hamas movement squeaked past the rival Fatah faction in a
student vote this week, but saw its on-campus popularity decline,
Birzeit University officials said Thursday.


For the second year in a row Hamas remains in control of the
51-member student council at the West Bank's prestigious
university, but its mandate has narrowed since last year.


Hamas lost one seat while Fatah, loyal to moderate Palestinian
president Mahmud Abbas, picked up three.


The hardline Islamists, considered a terrorist outfit in Israel
and the West, now hold a razor-thin 22-21 seat majority over
Fatah in the school's student body. Last year Hamas won 23 seats,
while Fatah picked up just 18.


The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine won six seats
this year, up from five in 2006, while the radical Islamic Jihad
repeated its 2006 performance, winning just two seats.


University election trends in the Palestinian territories are
closely followed as a barometer of factions' overall strength.
Hamas's declining fortunes at a university they have
traditionally ruled would seem to indicate the movement has lost
support since winning parliamentary elections in January 2006.


Birzeit University, north of Ramallah, has a student body of
about 6,000 and is one of the leading academic institutions in
the Palestinian territories.


Fatah's West Bank leader Marwan Barghuti, internationally
respected politician Hanan Ashrawi and Hamas bomb maker Yahya
Ayyash are among the prominent politicians, thinkers and
militants who have graduated from the university.
