Liverpool defender Fabio Aurelio will be fit for the start of
next season after a successful Achilles tendon operation.


It had been feared that Aurelio would be sidelined well into the
2007-08 campaign after he ruptured a tendon during Tuesday's
Champions League win at PSV Eindhoven.


But Liverpool Rafa Benitez revealed that the Brazilian left-
back's surgery on Wednesday had gone well enough for him to be
ready for pre-season.


"He will be fit for the pre-season," Benitez told Liverpool's
website. "Yesterday he had an operation and it was really good.
It was over quickly, the doctor carried out a new kind of
operation.


"He was playing really well, so it was a pity to see him get
injured again."
