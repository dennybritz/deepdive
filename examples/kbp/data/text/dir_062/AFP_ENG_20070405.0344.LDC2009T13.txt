Hundreds of Pakistani human rights activists rallied Thursday to
urge the government to act against Islamic students who have
launched "anti-vice" patrols in the capital Islamabad.


Around 600 protesters chanted slogans calling upon the
authorities to "curb the rise of extremist forces in the country
that are promoting intolerance and violence," an AFP photographer
witnessed.


The protest came a week after after burqa-clad girls from the
Jamia Hafsa religious school in the capital abducted a local
woman accused of running a brothel.


They released the women and her two relatives two days later,
after making her read out a confession.


Male students from the adjacent Red Mosque meanwhile have formed
Taliban-style "Vice and Virtue" squads urging owners of DVD and
music shops to shut their business.


The students were "harassing and terrorising ordinary citizens of
Pakistan in the name of Islam" and must be stopped, said a joint
statement by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and a dozen
non-governmental organisations.


It also urged people to "rise against these extremist religious
bigoted forces and secure the future of the present and future
generations."


Deputy information minister Tariq Azeem said last week that the
government had taken a very serious view of the situation and
would get tough on the school and on any Islamic vigilantes.


However the mosque in an open letter to President Pervez
Musharraf released Thursday told Musharraf to "not start a civil
war" by taking action against its students.
