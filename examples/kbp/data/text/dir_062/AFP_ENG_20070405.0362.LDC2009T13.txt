The Democratic Republic of Congo's state prosecutor has demanded
the death penalty for five men accused of killing a journalist
and his wife in 2005, a local media rights group said Thursday.


A military tribunal in Kinshasa-Matete is set to deliver its
verdict on April 13, putting an end to a trial which has dragged
since July 12 last year.


Franck Kangundu, a journalist with La Reference Plus daily, and
his wife Helene Paka were killed on November 3, 2005 outside
their home in Limete, a working class eastern suburb of Kinshasa,
by armed men.


The accused, three soldiers and two civilians, are being tried
for murder, extortion and the theft of arms. The initial charge
of manslaughter was changed to murder by the military tribunal.


The local Journalists in Danger media rights group on Thursday
also said   that lawyers had "deplored the light manner in which
the police and the military court have handled the case" and the
fact that despite numerous requests several people had not been
allowed to testify.


The chief accused, 2nd Lieutenant Joel Muganda, who has admitted
using the victim's cellphone, had asked the judge to try him
alone and denied that the other four were involved.
