The US economy will overcome a housing slowdown and avert
recession, while the rest of the global economy is in sound
health, IMF chief economist Simon Johnson said Thursday.


"The message here is reassuring: we do not think the US is
heading for recession," the International Monetary Fund official
told a news conference.


Johnson acknowledged the housing slowdown underway in the world's
largest economy, "but we're not seeing it spread beyond
residential construction."


He added: "If the United States sneezes, you should worry about
other parts of the world catching cold. But at the moment, other
parts of the world are healthy."
