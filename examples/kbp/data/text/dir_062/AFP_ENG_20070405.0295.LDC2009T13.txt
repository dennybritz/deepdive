The Swiss employment group Adecco said on Thursday it is
nominating Juergen Dormann, outgoing head of Swedish-Swiss
engineering giant ABB, as the company's new board chairman.


Dormann, 67, has been a board member of Adecco since June 2004
and vice chairman since November 2005, the company said in a
statement.


The appointment is subject to Dormann's re-election to the board
at Adecco's annual general meeting on May 8, just days after he
steps down as ABB chairman in favour of Hubertus von Gruenberg.
