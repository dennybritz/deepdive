A Gambian journalist has been charged with sedition and released
on bail, more than a week after she was taken into custody in the
Gambian capital, the press union said on Thursday.


Fatou Jaw Manneh, a Gambian journalist based in the United
States, "has been bailed yesterday (Wednesday) and will go (to)
court the 11th for the charge of sedition," head of the Gambia
Press Union, Madi Ceesay, told AFP.


Manneh, who writes editorials for a Gambian news website called
All-Gambian.net was arrested by Gambian National Intelligence
Agency agents when she arrived at the Banjul airport on March 28,
on her way to attend her father's funeral.


She is being prosecuted for an article she wrote for private
daily The Independent in 2004 viewed as hostile to Gambian
President Yahya Jammeh.


Ceesay said the bail had been set at 25,000 dalasis (680 euros,
915 dollars), and that Manneh could face up to six months behind
bars.


The Gambian government wants "journalists ... to think twice
before writing an article," Ceesay lamented.


In recent years numerous groups have spoken out against the
arrests, harassment and even assassinations of journalists in
Gambia, a country considered by many human rights organisations
to have Africa's most hostile regime towards the press.
