ExxonMobil, the world's biggest oil company, pumped up earnings
10 percent in the first quarter as lower profits from crude oil
were offset by other improvements, the company said Thursday.


The latest earnings for the biggest global company, in terms of
market value and profits in 2006, amounted to 1.62 dollars per
share, 10 cents better than Wall Street expectations.


Total revenues declined slightly to 87.2 billion dollars from
88.9 billion a year earlier.


About six billion dollars of profits came from so-called
"upstream" operations that include oil and gas exploration and
production. This was down slightly from 6.4 billion a year ago.


But it was offset by "downstream" refining and marketing
operations, which generated a higher profit of 1.9 billion
dollars and from chemicals, whose profit grew to 1.3 billion.


In 2006, ExxonMobil's profit rose to 39.5 billion dollars,
believed to be the biggest corporate profit haul ever, prompting
renewed ire over US government policies said to favor big oil
firms.
