EU regulators on Thursday approved the purchase of the operator
of Madame Tussauds waxwork museums by the owner of the Legoland
amusement parks, Merlin Entertainments Group.


"After examining the operation, the (European) Commission
concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede
effective competition," the EU antitrust watchdog said in a
statement.


Merlin, controlled by US investment fund Blackstone Group, agreed
in March to pay Dubai International Capital 1.028 billion pounds
(2.046 billion dollars, 1.505 billion euros) for The Tussauds
Group.


Merlin and TTG welcomed more than 30 million visitors to their 50
attractions and four hotels in 2006.


The group operates Madame Tussauds sites worldwide, the London
Eye -- the world's tallest observation wheel -- as well as theme
parks across Britain.


Merlin operates 38 attractions across 11 countries, including
Italy's biggest theme park, Gardaland.
