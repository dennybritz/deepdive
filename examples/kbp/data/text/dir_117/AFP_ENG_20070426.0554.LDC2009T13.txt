A man was pulled alive from the rubble of a six-storey apartment
block that collapsed in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul on
Thursday, trapping at least one other person, officials said.


The 33-year-old survivor, Ozkan Aysan, had his feet crushed, but
his injuries are not life-threatening, medical officials told
Anatolia news agency.


Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler had said earlier that two people,
both believed to be alive, were trapped under the wreckage in
Sirinevler district, on the city's European side.


Media reports suggested the second person might be a small girl.


Residents evacuated the building "to a large extent" about half
an hour before it collapsed after they heard it creaking, but
some went back to collect belongings, Guler said.


Aysan's relatives said he went back to take his computer.


Istanbul Mayor Kadir Topbas put the blame on construction workers
who damaged the weight-bearing columns of the building while
carrying out the controlled demolition of a neighbouring block.


The building was already damaged by a deadly earthquake that hit
northwestern Turkey in 1999, neighbourhood official Fethi Akatay
told the NTV channel.


Rescuers toiled on huge chunks of concrete atop the wreckage of
the building, which was completely razed to the ground.


Some people wept and shouted for help.


Two people were killed and 28 others injured when a five-storey
residential building collapsed in February in another part of
Istanbul, a sprawling city of 12 million people.


Turkey's construction sector is notorious for low standards.
Shoddy buildings have been blamed for heavy death tolls in
earthquakes, which frequently rock the country.


Construction companies often disregard regulations, while
authorities fail to enforce the law.
