Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres on Thursday praised
outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair as a brilliant leader
who could not control the situation in Iraq.


"Blair was a brilliant leader. He changed (Britain) a great deal
from a social point of view, from an economic point of view,"
Peres told journalists.


"But, leaders are being invited to occasions that they did not
invent. And that was the case with Tony Blair concerning the
Iraqi story," he added.


"It wasn't simple. I think he handled it with great care as much
as he could, but he couldn't control the whole situation," Peres
stressed.


Blair's decision to back the US-led invasion of Iraq in March
2003 has become increasingly unpopular in Britain and severely
hurt his Labour Party's poll ratings.


He is expected to resign shortly after the May 3 elections to the
Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and English local
councils, triggering a seven- week campaign to select and install
a successor.
