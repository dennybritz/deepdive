The United States and Norway played down Thursday differences in
their policy toward the new Palestinian government.


Norway is the only Western country to have normalised ties with
the government, which contains members of the Hamas militant
group, and plans to resume direct aid to it -- a policy setting
it apart from its US and European Union allies.


"There is no discontent," said Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Gahr Stoere at a media conference with US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice, ahead of a meeting with their NATO counterparts
in Oslo, Norway.


"There are nuances in the view of how and to what extent we talk
to this government, but I call them nuances," he said.


Hamas, which led the previous government, appears on the terror
blacklists of the United States and the European Union.


Since the new government was formed, both have begun making
contact with non- Hamas ministers who respect the principles
outlined by the Middle East diplomatic Quartet, which includes
the US, EU, Russia and the United Nations.


Those conditions are to recognize Israel, renounce violence and
respect past peace agreements.


Rice said policies on contacts with the Palestinians "will vary
from state to state".


She said "the United States will on a selective basis have
contacts with those ministers who themselves are committed to the
Quartet principles."


Stoere said that Norway's position allowed it to "pass very clear
messages" to the Palestinian government.
