Work-related accidents and illnesses lead to the deaths of about
2.2 million people every year and cause huge cost to the global
economy, the International Labour Organisation said Friday.


A report by the ILO calling for better health and safety
practices in the workplace found that 270 million workers were
injured while another 160 million suffered from work-related
illnesses.


The toll wipes an estimated four percent from Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) a year, equivalent to 20 times all official
development aid put together, said the report.


"Accidents don't go with the job", Sameera Maziadi Al-Tuwaijri,
director of the ILO's Safework programme, said in a statement.


"Experience shows that most accidents are preventable," he added,
calling for a more consistent approach to prevention by
governments, employers and workers at national level and inside
companies.


Apart from better practices in the workplace, the report
advocated formal reporting, inspections and standards.


It underlined that proper measures could also improve
productivity.


The report was launched to coincide with the World Day for Safety
and Health at Work.
