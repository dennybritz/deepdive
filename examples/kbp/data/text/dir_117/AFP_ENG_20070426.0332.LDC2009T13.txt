South Korea Thursday welcomed Myanmar's decision to restore
diplomatic ties with North Korea, saying it could promote
regional peace.


A government spokesman quoted by Yonhap news agency said Seoul
expected the decision would provide momentum for North Korea's
opening and contribute to peace and stability in the region.


Myanmar severed relations following a bomb attack by North Korean
agents on the entourage of then-South Korean president Chun Doo-
Hwan at the Aung San Mausoleum in Yangon in October 1983.


Chun survived the blast but it killed 17 of his entourage,
including four cabinet ministers, while 17 others were wounded.
Four Myanmar officials also died.


North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, quoting a
joint communique, said the decision was taken "based on the
principles of respect for each other's sovereignty, non-
interference in their internal affairs, and equality and mutual
benefit, as well as the norms of international law and the
objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter..."


Both countries are outcasts in the eyes of much of the Western
world. Myanmar has been under military rule since 1962 and is
widely accused of rights abuses.


North Korea is also accused of massive rights abuses, and its
missile and nuclear programmes have attracted international
condemnation and sanctions.


But South Korea since 1998 has practised a "sunshine" policy of
engagement with its neighbour in hopes of encouraging reform and
reducing tensions.
