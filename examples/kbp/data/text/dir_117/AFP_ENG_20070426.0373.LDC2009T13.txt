A Czech court ruled Thursday that a British tourist who was
seriously injured when a Christmas tree collapsed on top of him
should receive 560,000 koruna (19,940 euros, 27,200 dollars)
compensation.


British tourist Malcolm Tuffin received a fractured femur and
injuries to his spine and chest when the 23-metre high tree fell
on top of him at a Christmas market in the centre of the city
during high winds in December 2003.


Tuffin's Czech lawyer told AFP that the Prague court held the
city council and the operator of the market responsible for his
injuries. Both had previously refused to admit they were at
fault.


"This is a victory," lawyer Marie Cilinkova said, adding that it
would open up the way for Tuffin to claim the remaining 2.0
million koruna which a local court last year awarded him in
damages.


Tuffin, a commercial manager from southern England, spent weeks
in hospital recovering from his injuries. He was still suffering
head pains and having difficulty walking nearly two years after
the accident, Cilinkova had told AFP previously.
