Nadia Petrova will be back at next month's German Open in Berlin
to defend the title she won last year as the tournament's
strongest-ever field was announced on Thursday.


The 24-year-old Russian, currently ninth in the world, will join
Belgian world number one Justine Henin, plus Australia Open
winner Serena Williams, with eight of the world's top ten players
confirmed for the May 7-13 tournament.


"This is the best participant field we have ever had in Berlin,
we can now be compared with a Grand Slam tournament," said Sheikh
Mohamed Bin Faleh Al Thani, president of the Qatar Tennis
Federation, the tournament's sponsors, in a Berlin press
conference.


Prize-money worth 1.34 million dollars is up for grabs and Sheikh
Mohamed also revealed the event's future has been confirmed for
the next two years.


"There will be a tournament in 2008 here in Berlin and we want to
make the 2009 tournament of the highest standard on the WTA
tour," he said.
