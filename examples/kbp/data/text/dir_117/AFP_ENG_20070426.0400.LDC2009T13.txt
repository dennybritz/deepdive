Three heavily armed suspected militants were arrested at a
popular crafts market in the heart of the Indian capital on
Thursday, television reports said.


Commandos from the police anti-terrorism unit captured the
suspects at Delhi Haat, a favourite shopping spot for foreign
tourists, according to several television networks.


They were carrying military-type RDX explosives, the reports
said.


A police control room official confirmed "some arrests" at the
market but said he had no further details.


India's Star TV and Aaj Tak national news network said the trio
were also armed with hand grenades and were suspected to belong
to the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba pan-Islamic guerrilla group.


The government-funded market is close to the Sarojini Nagar
shopping arcade where a bomb blast just before a major Hindu
festival two years ago killed 62 people and wounded dozens of
others.


Lashkar, which is fighting Indian rule in disputed Kashmir, was
blamed by Indian authorities for the October 29, 2005 attack.
