Beijing formally announced Thursday the route for the 2008
Olympic torch relay, saying the flame would be carried to Tibet
and to its rival Taiwan.


The flame would be carried to at least 22 cities throughout the
world's five continents, including capitals such as Paris, London
and Pyongyang, while also passing through scores of Chinese
cities, the announcement said.


"By ... crossing the five continents and going to new places the
Beijing 2008 torch relay, will, as its theme says, be a journey
of harmony, friendship and respect to people of different
nationalities races and creeds," said Jacques Rogge, president of
the International Olympic Committee.
