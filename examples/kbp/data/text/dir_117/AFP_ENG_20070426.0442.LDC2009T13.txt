Sweden on Thursday rejected an appeal by former Bosnian Serb
president and convicted war criminal Biljana Plavsic for a pardon
to end her 11-year jail sentence there, the justice ministry
said.


Plavsic, 76, had requested a pardon on the grounds of her
advanced age, failing health and poor prison conditions that she
said made her sentence "much, much longer."


The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
(ICTY) in The Hague sentenced Plavsic in February 2003 for crimes
against humanity during the country's 1992-95 war, which claimed
more than 200,000 lives.


The self-styled Bosnian Serb "Iron Lady" is the highest ranking
official of the former Yugoslavia to have acknowledged
responsibility for the atrocities committed in the Balkan wars.


Sweden agreed to house Plavsic in one of its prisons in response
to a request from the tribunal. She was transferred in June 2003
and is an inmate at the Hinseberg women's prison.


In September 2006 Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations,
Milos Prica, acting in a private capacity, requested Plavsic's
release, justice ministry legal advisor Lars Brandt told AFP.


Had Sweden granted Plavsic's request, a final decision in the
case would have rested with the ICTY.


"It ends here as the request was rejected. If she had been
granted pardon then the Tribunal would have had to look at the
case," Brandt said.
