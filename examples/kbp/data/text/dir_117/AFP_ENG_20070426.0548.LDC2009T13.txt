Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed to NATO Thursday
Russia's suspension of the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
treaty, alliance Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said.


"Sergei Lavrov confirmed President Putin's statement made this
morning that Russia is suspending -- he used the word moratorium
-- its adherence to the adapted CFE treaty," Scheffer said.


Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a state of the nation speech
Thursday, said Moscow could pull out of the CFE until all of
NATO's current members ratified it.


"That message was met by concern, grave concern, disappointment
and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the
CFE treaty is one of the cornerstones of European security,"
Scheffer said.


The treaty was signed in 1990 in Paris by the countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the former Warsaw
Pact to limit military hardware in the region.


It was adapted in Istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the
Warsaw Pact, in order to limit deployments on a country-by-
country basis.


NATO states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds
that Moscow has failed to honour commitments made in Istanbul to
withdraw Russian forces from the former Soviet republics of
Georgia and Moldova.


Putin's insistence that all countries ratify the CFE appeared
particularly aimed at the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, which were once part of the Soviet Union and are not
part of the treaty.


The three are all now members of NATO.
