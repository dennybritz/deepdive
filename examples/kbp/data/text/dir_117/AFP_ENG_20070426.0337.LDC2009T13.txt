Terrorism will not be solved unless solutions for the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict are found first, Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf said Thursday during a visit to Spain.


"We can not say we will stop terrorism and extremism and then we
will look at solving this dispute. This is putting the cart
before the horse, it is not do- able," he said during an address
to university students in the southern Spanish city of Cordoba.


"If we want to bring harmony to the world we can not fail to
resolve the Palestinian dispute, whatever it costs," he added.


Pakistan, a key ally in the US-led war against terrorism, backs a
separate state for Palestinians with Jerusalem as its capital and
recognition of the existence of the state of Israel.


Musharraf said political disputes like the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict together with poverty and illiteracy were the three main
causes of terrorism.


"Terrorism is a symptom, we must get at the cause. If we keep
battling the symptom we will never win," he added.


Musharraf was in Spain as part of a four-nation tour of Europe
that includes stops in Bosnia, Poland and Turkey.
