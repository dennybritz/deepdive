Pakistan's relationship with India, strained over a long-standing
dispute over Kashmir, are gradually warming, Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf said Thursday during a visit to Spain.


"We are improving our relations, we are trying to resolve our
disputes, and there is reasonable progress," he said during an
address to students in the southern city of Cordoba.


Pakistani and Indian leaders began a series of negotiations in
2004 to help resolve the Kashmir issue and other disputes.


The neighbouring countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, a
mountainous Himalayan region divided between them and claimed in
its entirety by both, since their independence from British rule
in 1947.


Tensions between the two nations flared again following a suicide
attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001 that killed 14
people which some in India suggested was carried out by Kashmiri
militants armed and trained by Pakistan.


Islamabad denied the allegation.


The incident led to a massive build-up of troops along their
common border during 2002 and international concern about a
possible war.


Musharraf was in Spain as part of a four-nation tour of Europe
which also includes stops in Poland, Bosnia and Turkey.
