EU lawmakers condemned the heavy-handed repression of protests by
opposition activists recently in Russia and called on Moscow to
avoid repeats ahead of presidential elections.


In a resolution, the European Parliament said it was "deeply
troubled" by the Russian authorities' use of force to clamp down
on opposition protestors recently.


They called on Moscow to respect free expression and the right to
hold public gatherings, while describing the repression of
journalists as "unacceptable".


The resolution comes ahead of an EU-Russia summit on May 18 in
Samara, Russia.


Moscow has met with condemnation from the United States and
European Union following a violent crackdown by police against
opposition protestors earlier this month and has accused foreign
journalists of exaggerating the importance of the demonstrations.
