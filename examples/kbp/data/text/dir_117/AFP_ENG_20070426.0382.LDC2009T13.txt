Ethiopian rebels have not contacted the International Committee
of the Red Cross for help in the release of seven Chinese oil
workers captured in an attack this week, an ICRC spokeswoman said
Thursday.


"For the time being, we have not been approached or contacted at
all," Anna Schaaf told AFP in Geneva.


Abderahmane Mahdi, a London-based spokesman for the ONLF, said
the group was planning to release the hostages to the ICRC.


Schaaf said the ICRC was ready to take the seven Chinese if it
was asked, provided it received adequate guaranteees for the
operation.


The seven oil workers were seized during an attack by the Ogaden
National Liberation Front (ONLF) at a Chinese-run oil exploration
operation in Ethiopia's eastern Ogaden region.


Of the 77 people killed in the assault, nine were Chinese
nationals.


The Chinese embassy in Ethiopia on Thursday expressed hope for
the quick release of their seven workers.


The separatist ONLF is fighting for the independence of ethnic
Somalis in Oganen.
