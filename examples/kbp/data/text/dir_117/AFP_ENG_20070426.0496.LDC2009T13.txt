The resumption of talks between Russia and Poland over a trade
dispute that has held up a key EU-Russia agreement depends on
Warsaw, Russia's agriculture minister said Thursday.


"The start of the next phase of negotiations will depend on the
Polish side and will take place when they are ready.... We have
already put forward our proposals," Alexei Gordeyev was quoted by
Interfax as saying.


Russia's veterinary service Rosselkhoznadzor and European experts
"have again found that 20 percent of meat products ready to be
exported to Russia did not correspond to the norms," Gordeyev
said.


Since November last year, Poland has blocked the start of talks
between the European Union and Russia on a new partnership
agreement because of a Russian meat embargo imposed in November
2005.


EU officials have said they are hoping to resolve the trade
dispute ahead of an EU-Russia summit on May 18 in the Russian
city of Samara so as to launch negotiations on the new agreement
then.
