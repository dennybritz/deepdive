Alain Delon, the 71-year-old French film star, has been laid up
by a minor heart problem, causing a Paris play he is in to be put
on hold for a week, his representatives said Thursday.


The blue-eyed actor -- best known for his leading roles in the
1960s and 1970s, such as "Le Samourai" and "Plein Soleil" -- felt
ill at home late Wednesday, just hours before appearing on stage
in "Sur La Route de Madison" (an adaptation of the 1995 film "The
Bridges of Madison County").


His cardiologist diagnosed heart trouble linked to excessive
fatigue and ordered him to take complete rest at home for a week.


There was no need for him to be hospitalised and his condition
was not expected to worsen, his representatives said.


Delon has suffered from cardiovascular problems in recent years.
He has already been forced to interrupt his play for a week in
February when he came down with a bad 'flu.
