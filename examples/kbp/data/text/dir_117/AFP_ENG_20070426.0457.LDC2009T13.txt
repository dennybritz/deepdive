Several cars parked outside a police station in central Athens on
Thursday, including a squad car, were attacked with firebombs by
a group of 30 youths, a police source said.


The attack in the working class district of Exarcheia, an
anarchist stronghold, marks the second straight day of vandalism
in the area which borders the affluent district of Kolonaki.


On Wednesday, a group of suspected anarchists threw stones and
firebombs at the private offices of Justice Minister Anastassis
Papaligouras and Culture Minister George Voulgarakis, formerly
minister of public order.


Earlier on Thursday, another group threw firebombs at the
headquarters of the Athens riot police department near the city
centre.


These prior attacks are believed to be linked to the alleged
beating of a self- declared anarchist held at a Greek prison on
Monday.


News of the alleged beating caused a protest at the prison at
Malandrino, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) northwest of
Athens, and inmates at another 10 prisons around the country also
began protests on Tuesday, complaining about overcrowding at each
facility.


Order was restored at most of the facilities the same day. Some
200 inmates at Malandrino held on, occupying the prison roof for
three days but returning to their cells earlier on Thursday.
