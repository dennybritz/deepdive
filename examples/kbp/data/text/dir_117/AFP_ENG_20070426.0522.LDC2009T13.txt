Madrid's conservative mayor on Thursday said he wants to install
surveillance cameras in an area of the city where prostitutes
work to deter their clients and improve security.


Mayor Alberto Ruiz Gallardon made the proposal as he faced
reelection in May 27 municipal elections. Residents had requested
cameras, even threatening to install their own webcams and make
the video available on the Internet if something was not done.


The cameras are to be installed along Montera Street in the
centre of Madrid, an area known for prostitution.


Security had become a concern for residents, who have complained
of regularly being insulted and threatened by pimps. Residents
allege eastern European prostitution rings that have arrived in
recent years have made life more difficult for them.


The mayor said that only public authorities have the power to
install surveillance cameras and that any attempt by residents to
do so would be illegal.


About 20 cameras were installed last year at Madrid's famous
Plaza Mayor, which tourists often visit.
