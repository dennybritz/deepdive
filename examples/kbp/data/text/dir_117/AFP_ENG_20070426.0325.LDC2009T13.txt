India's biggest private company, Reliance Industries, on Thursday
reported fourth quarter net profit rose by a better than expected
14 percent, led by better margins.


For the three months ended March 31, net profit rose to 28.53
billion rupees (699 million dollars), beating market forecasts of
27.3 billion rupees, on sales which rose 5.5 percent to 259.8
billion rupees.


Full-year net profit jumped 20.1 percent to 109 billion rupees.


Gross refining margins for Reliance rose 11 percent in the fourth
quarter to 13 dollars per barrel against 10.4 dollars per barrel
a year earlier, a company statement said.


During the fourth quarter, Reliance processed 8.1 million tonnes
of crude, reflecting average utilization of over 98 percent.


For the full year, the refinery processed 31.7 million tonnes of
crude.


"Our petrochemicals and refining business recorded its best-ever
performance and we made substantial investments in our future
growth engines" such as oil exploration and production and retail
business, chairman Mukesh Ambani said.


Reliance added 46 fuel stations in the fourth quarter to bring
outlets to  1,385 outlets by end-March, the statement said.


Reliance Industries rose 1.56 percent to a day's high of 1,624.8
before retracing on profit booking to close at 1,596.7, down 3.1
rupees or 0.19 percent.
