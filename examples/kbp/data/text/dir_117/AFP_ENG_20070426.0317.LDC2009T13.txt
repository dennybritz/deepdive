Nigeria plans to set up a training camp in Nairobi, Kenya, ahead
of their decisive 2008 African Cup of Nations qualifier against
Uganda in Kampala.


German coach Berti Vogts told reporters that he wants the Super
Eagles to train in Nairobi before their June 2 clash against
Uganda. A test game against either Kenya or Tanzania is also
planned.


"We may have to camp in Nairobi for the match against Uganda so
as to acclimatise. We would camp for at least four days even
though I would have wanted to have the players for a longer
time," said Vogts.


Vogts is expected to name a squad of mostly Europe-based players
for the match.


Nigeria pipped Uganda 1-0 in March to consolidate their
leadership of Group Three of the qualifying tournament. They have
recorded nine points from three matches while Uganda are second
in the standings with four points.


The other teams in the group are Lesotho and Niger with only the
group winner assured of an automatic qualification for the
biennial Nations Cup to be staged in Ghana in January.
