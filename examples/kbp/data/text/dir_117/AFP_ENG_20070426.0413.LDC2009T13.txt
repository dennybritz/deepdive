Taiwan on Thursday said the Beijing Olympic torch relay to Taipei
was unacceptable, saying the route arrangement was aimed at
belittling the island.


"The Beijing authorities attempt to turn the relay into a
domestic route and therefore dwarf our status. This is absolutely
unacceptable," Tsai Chen-wei, chairman of Taiwan's Olympic
Committee, said in a statement.


Taiwanese authorities had demanded that the island be included on
the international route rather than as part of China's domestic
relay which they feel would imply the island was part of China,
as Beijing insists.


Announcing the torch route earlier in Beijing, Olympic organisers
said the flame would visit Taipei after sweeping through the
cities of Pyongyang and Ho Chi Minh, and before moving on to Hong
Kong and Macau.


Taiwanese authorities have demanded that the torch relay for the
Beijing 2008 Games must arrive and depart the island via a third
country, a decision aimed to highlight Taiwan's sovereignty
independent of China.
