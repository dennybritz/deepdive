The US Congress passed a bill Thursday setting a timeline for
withdrawal from Iraq despite President George W. Bush's threat to
veto it.


The Senate voted 51 to 46 in favor of the bill, which includes
the timeline together with emergency funding legislation for US
forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.


The bill "sets us on a new course, away from a civil war with no
end in sight toward a responsible phased redeployment that holds
Iraqis accountable. This is a responsible plan for redeployment,
not a precipitous withdrawal," said Senator Democrat leader Harry
Reid before the vote.
