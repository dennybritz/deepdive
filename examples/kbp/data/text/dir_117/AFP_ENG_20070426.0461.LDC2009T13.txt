Kenya has lined up two friendly internationals against Uganda and
Nigeria here next month as part of its preparation for the Africa
Nations Cup, the football board said Thursday.


The Harambee Stars, who play Swaziland in a return leg game in
Mbabane on June 2, will host Uganda's Cranes in Nairobi on March
20 and the Nigerian Super Eagles a week a later.


The Nigerians are set to arrive in Kenya on May 25 to set up a
training camp before travelling to Kampala for their decisive
Group 3 encounter against Uganda.


"It's a big relief for Harambee Stars to play build-up matches
against two big teams at home," said Sammy Obingo, the secretary
for the Kenya Football Federation.


"But in particular against the mighty Super Eagles after our
request to play South Africa in Johannesburg on May 27 failed to
materialise after the South Africans said they were committed
elsewhere," Obingo said.
