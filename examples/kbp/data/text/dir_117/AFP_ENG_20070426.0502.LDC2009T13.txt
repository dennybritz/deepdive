The French unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage points in
March to 8.3 percent, the French employment ministry announced on
Thursday.


The employment ministry said the number of jobseekers in March
fell 1.4 percent to 2.037 million, while the unemployment rate
according to International Labour Organisation norms fell 0.1
points from the February level to 8.3 percent.


The figure comes at a critical time ahead of the final round of
presidential elections on May 6 with the solution to France's
stubbornly high unemployment rate a key policy focus for both
candidates.


Right-wing candidate Nicholas Sarkozy, a former finance and
interior ministry in the incumbent centre-right government, is up
against Socialist rival Segolene Royal in the run-off.
