A 5.4-magnitude earthquake rocked the northern Japanese island of
Hokkaido early Friday, the US Geological Survey said, but there
were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.


The quake struck at 1:38 am (1637 GMT Thursday), 88 kilometres
(54 miles) southwest of Kushiro city on Hokkaido, at a depth of
36 kilometres, the US agency said.


Japanese news agency Kyodo said no tsunami alert had been issued.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes. A
7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe in January
1995 killed more than 6,400 people.
