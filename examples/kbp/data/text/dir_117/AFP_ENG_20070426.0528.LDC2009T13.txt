US President George W. Bush will veto newly passed legislation
that ties Iraq war funding to an October 1 start date for a US
troop withdrawal, the White House said Thursday.


"I just spoke to the president in the Oval Office and, as he said
he would for weeks, the president will veto this legislation,"
spokeswoman Dana Perino said after the US Senate approved the
bill, sending it to his desk.
