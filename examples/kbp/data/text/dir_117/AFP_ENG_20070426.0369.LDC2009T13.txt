Zambia President Levy Mwanawasa announced Thursday that his
country had secured a loan of 39 million dollars from China to be
used for repairing infrastructure that has been destroyed by
floods.


Mwanawasa said the money from Beijing will be used to procure
earth-moving equipments that will be used in the construction of
roads and bridges, which were destroyed by heavy rains.


"We have secured a 39 million dollar loan from China to be used
for the procurement of earth moving equipment," Mwanawasa said
during a swearing-in ceremony for the new Chinese ambassador to
Zambia, Li Qiangmin.


He said the machinery will be in Zambia by June this year.


Heavy rains in Zambia earlier this year displaced hundreds of
thousands of people and destroyed roads, bridges and schools in
mainly rural areas.
