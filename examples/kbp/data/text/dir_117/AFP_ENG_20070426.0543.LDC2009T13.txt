America's top stock watchdog, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said Thursday it had agreed to tighten its
cooperation with German market regulator BaFin.


SEC chairman Christopher Cox and German Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) president Jochen Sanio formally
approved a deepening of ties in Berlin earlier Thursday, the SEC
said.


"We must continue working together to facilitate the seamless and
efficient regulation of internationally active firms in the
United States and Germany," Cox said in a statement.


The accord, which includes an information-sharing agreement, will
enhance the regulators oversight of public companies operating in
both countries.


It was also inked as US and European stock market operators forge
closer ties as investors demand broader trading opportunities.
