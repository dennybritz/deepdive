New Hampshire voted Thursday to approve civil unions for same-sex
partners, joining a small but growing group of US states giving
legal recognition to gay partnerships.


The bill, which passed in the northeastern state's senate by 14
votes to 10, gives gay couples the right to enter civil unions
with the same rights, responsibilities, and obligations as
married couples, a senate spokeswoman said.


The measure was due to be signed into law within the next five
days, a spokeswoman for the governor's office added.


In 2000, New Hampshire's neighbor Vermont became the first US
state to offer civil unions to gay couples.


Four years later, Massachusetts became what is still the only US
state to recognize same-sex marriages.


Connecticut and Maine also offer some sort of civil union or
domestic partnerships, but the issue continues to be a source of
deep division in most other states, especially in more
conservative areas.


"If you look at the national picture, we are seeing across the
country more and more support for family recognition for gay and
lesbian families," Roberta Sklar from the National Gay and
Lesbian Taskforce said after the vote.


"We highly commend the New Hampshire legislature," she added.
