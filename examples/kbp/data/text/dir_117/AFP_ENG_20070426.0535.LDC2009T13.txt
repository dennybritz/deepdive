Sri Lankan troops fearing a rebel attack fired anti-aircraft
weapons and evacuated passengers from the international airport
here late Thursday, an official said.


Passengers were ordered to leave the upper floors of the airport
after the military received reports of a possible Tiger attack on
the neighbouring Katunayake airbase.


Troops at the military base, which was attacked by Tamil Tiger
rebels a month ago, fired anti-aircraft weapons, a senior
government official said.


"The firing lasted a few minutes following information that a
Tiger aircraft was cited heading towards the airport. There was,
however, no attack," the official said.


Residents near the Bandaranaike international airport, which
shares a runway with the airbase, said the gunfire went on for
about 10 minutes.


"Passengers were ordered to the ground floor after we heard gun
fire and some blasts," a woman passenger at the airport said by
telephone. "It was a panic situation, but no one was hurt."


It was not immediately clear whether any international flights
were affected.


Immediately after the alarm was raised at the airport, a power
failure plunged the capital into darkness.


The authorities had been switching off power to the city to test
their defence systems in case of a night-time rebel air attack.


The guerrillas flew over a northern military complex on Tuesday
and bombed security personnel, killing six and wounding 13.
