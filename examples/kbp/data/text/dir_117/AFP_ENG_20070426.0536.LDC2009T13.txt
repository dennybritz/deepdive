UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday that Pope
Benedict XVI had accepted his invitation to visit UN headquarters
"at a mutually convenient time."


Ban said he had extended the invitation to the pope during his
recent visit to Rome.


"I'm very much happy that he accepted my invitation to visit the
United Nations," said Ban at a press conference after returning
from a tour of Italy, Switzerland, Qatar and Syria.


The pope's predecessor, Pope John Paul II, visited UN
headquarters in 1979 and in 1995 for the 40th anniversary of the
institution.
