A share of state revenues from the sell-off of assets from
bankrupt oil giant Yukos should go towards upgrading worn-out
public housing in Russia, President Vladimir Putin said on
Thursday.


Revenues "from the sale of Yukos assets for repaying its debts to
the state" could go towards the budget for repairing public
housing, Putin said in his annual state of the nation speech to
Russia's two houses of parliament.


Under Putin, the former Yukos empire has been dismantled in a
series of tax inquiries seen by critics as targeted at the firm's
politically ambitious CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now
serving an eight-year prison sentence.


The company, once Russia's largest oil producer, was bankrupted
and its assets are being sold off, with the main beneficiary
being state-controlled oil firm Rosneft, whose chairman Igor
Sechin is a key aide to Putin.


The announcement was one of several populist comments in a
Soviet-style speech in which Putin talked up economic development
in Russia while criticising the West.
