Myanmar's decision to restore diplomatic ties with North Korea
was unlikely to affect US relations with either country, a State
Department spokesman said Thursday.


"I don't think that the establishment of diplomatic relations
with either of these two countries has any profound impact on how
we view them," deputy spokesman Tom Casey told reporters.


Myanmar severed ties with North Korea in 1983 after a bid by
Pyongyang to assassinate South Korea's visiting then-president
Chun Doo Hwan.


Analysts said the two nations may been drawn together by the
perception that they share a common foe in the United States and
its allies.


Both countries have been at odds with the United States --
Myanmar for its decades of hardline military rule and North Korea
for outlawed missile and nuclear programs -- and have attracted
international condemnation and sanctions.


Both countries also face criticism over their human rights
records.
