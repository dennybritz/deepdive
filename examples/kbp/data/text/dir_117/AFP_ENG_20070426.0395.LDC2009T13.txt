Insufficient payments from Iran for the construction of the
country's first nuclear power station are delaying its completion
by Russia, a top Russian nuclear official said Thursday.


The head of Russia's federal agency for atomic energy Rosatom,
Sergei Kiriyenko, said the timetable for Russian contractors to
complete the Bushehr plant in the south of Iran would depend on
timely and full payments.


"When the payments are adequate, work is not interrupted,"
Kiriyenko was quoted by a spokesman as saying. "For the moment I
would not call them adequate."


"For now it is premature to talk of a specific time frame for the
construction of the Bushehr nuclear power station," Kiriyenko was
quoted as saying.


The completion of the power station, which is 95 percent ready,
and the delivery of nuclear fuel by Russia, planned for this
year, have been delayed by what Moscow described earlier as
financial problems.


Iran has been under pressure from the United States and the
European Union to freeze its civilian nuclear programme and
Washington has called on Moscow to halt construction of Bushehr.
