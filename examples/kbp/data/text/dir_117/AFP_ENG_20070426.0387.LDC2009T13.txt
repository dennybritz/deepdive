Ukraine mourned the victims of Chernobyl on Thursday, as
President Viktor Yushchenko said much relief work remained to be
done 21 years after the world's biggest nuclear accident.


The president and his former political ally Yulia Tymoshenko laid
flowers to the victims at a solemn overnight ceremony in the
capital marking the anniversary of the catastrophe in this ex-
Soviet state.


In the town of Slavutich, 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of the
ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear power station and home to many of
its former workers, thousands of mourners lit candles and laid
flowers at another monument.


"We bow our heads in sorrow before all the heroic rescue workers
and the victims of the nuclear disaster that struck our land on
April 26, 1986," Yushchenko said in a statement.


"As head of state I insist that all state authorities focus their
highest attention on the problems of developing the contaminated
territory and people's social rehabilitation," he said.


The president said that compensation and social aid for victims
this year would amount to nearly 4.5 billion Ukrainian hryvnias
(900 million dollars, 662 million euros).


Ukraine has spent 15 billion dollars over the past 20 years in
dealing with the after-effects of the disaster, and expects to
spend another 170 billion dollars by 2015.


Radioactive fallout from the accident at the plant affected five
million people, including 2.6 million Ukrainians.
