England coach Brian Ashton confirmed Thursday that players
involved for their clubs in Europe will not be considered for
either of England's two tests for their summer tour to South
Africa.


The Heineken Cup final is held on May 20, a day after the
European Challenge Cup final.


England play the Springboks on May 26 in Bloemfontein and on June
2 in Pretoria, and Ashton said: "I've reached the decision based
on three principles.


"Firstly, the players will not have time to prepare and
acclimatise for the first test match.


"Secondly, after their massive efforts spent in reaching the
Heineken and European Challenge Cup finals it gives this group of
players the opportunity to recharge their batteries before
meeting up again for the RWC (Rugby World Cup) warm up camps,
which start on June 25.


"Finally, I also feel very strongly that the players I will
select for the touring squad must be trusted and respected to
fulfil the two fixtures against South Africa."


The 32 man England squad to tour South Africa will be announced
on Tuesday, May 1.
