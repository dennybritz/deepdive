An apartment block collapsed in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul on
Thursday and several people were believed trapped under the
rubble, officials said.


Residents evacuated the building "to a large extent" about half
an hour before it collapsed after they heard it creaking, but
several might have gone back to collect belongings, Istanbul
Governor Muammer Guler told CNN Turk television.


There was no immediate information about dead or injured, he
said.


The building in the district of Sirinevler, on Istanbul's
European side, was already damaged by a deadly earthquake that
hit northwestern Turkey in 1999, neighbourhood official Fethi
Akatay, told the NTV channel.


Some media reports speculated that the collapse might have been
triggered by digging at a construction site about 20 meters
(yards) away.


Television footage showed people frantically trying to move big
chunks of concrete. Some wept and shouted for help.


Scores of ambulances and civil defence teams were dispatched to
the site.


There were conflicting reports about how many stories the
building had, ranging from six to eight.
