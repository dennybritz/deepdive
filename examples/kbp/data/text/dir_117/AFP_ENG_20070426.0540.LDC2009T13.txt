A leader of an Algerian Islamist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda
was killed Thursday in clashes with the army, a media report
said.


Samir Saioud, alias Samir Moussaab, was believed to be the
second-ranking leader in the Salafist Group for Preaching and
Combat, recently renamed as Al-Qaeda's branch in northern Africa.


He was killed in fighting in the Si Mustapha region east of
Algiers, the APS agency reported, citing an unnamed security
source. Saioud's body was identified by former members of his
group, it said.


The group claimed responsibility for a series of car bomb attacks
earlier this month, including one at the government's
headquarters that killed 30 people and injured more than 200.
