Ralf Schumacher will be getting a new Formula One boss after
Tsutomu Tomita quit his post as head of the Toyota team on
Thursday.


The 63-year-old will leave the Toyota team, currently fifth in
the Constructor's Championship, at the end of June and will be
replaced by acting boss Tadashi Yamashina, the current vice-
chairman of Toyota Motorsport.


Toyota's drivers, Schumacher and the Italian Jarno Trulli, are
currently joint tenth and seventh respectively in the Drivers
Championship after three races.


Tomita has been a driving force behind the Cologne-based team
since taking charge of all Toyota's motorsports engines in 1987
and many credit him as being the driving force behind their
decision to enter Formula One in 2002.


He said: "I have been involved in Toyota's Formula One project
since 2002, which has been one of the most challenging and
exciting periods of my career.      "In fact the detailed
preparation for entry into Formula One started more than four
years before we entered our first race.


"I am pleased to pass this on to Mr Yamashina and I am looking
forward to celebrating Toyota's first victory in Formula One
which I believe will happen sooner rather than later."
