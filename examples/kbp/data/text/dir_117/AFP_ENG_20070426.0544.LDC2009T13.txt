Pope Benedict XVI has accepted an invitation from UN Secretary
General Ban Ki- moon to visit the organisation's headquarters,
Italy's Ansa news agency reported Thursday.


Ban made the invitation while meeting with the pope at the
Vatican on April 18.


Benedict XVI's predecessor, John Paul II, visited United Nations
headquarters in 1979 and again in 1995 for the organisation's
40th birthday.
