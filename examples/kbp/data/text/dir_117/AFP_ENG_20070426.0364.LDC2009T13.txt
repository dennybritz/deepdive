The Greek coast guard on Thursday intercepted a wooden fishing
boat with 145 clandestine immigrants on board a few kilometres
southeast of the Athens coast, the merchant marine ministry said.


The coast guard were alerted by a distress call apparently made
by someone on the 27-metre (88-foot) boat, which was sailing
between the islands of Makronissos and Kea, the ministry said.


The boat suffered motor engine failure, a ministry press officer
told AFP.


It was towed to the port of Lavrio, some 60 kilometres (37 miles)
southeast of Athens, escorted by coast guard vessels and a
helicopter, the ministry said.


The migrants of various nationalities, among them 15 women and 13
children, were taken to the Lavrio health centre for medical
tests.


The authorities suspect that people-traffickers may be hiding in
the group.


The boat was sailing from Turkey to Italy.


Greece lies on a major people-smuggling transit route from Asia
to Western Europe, detaining scores of illegal migrants each
month both by land and sea.
