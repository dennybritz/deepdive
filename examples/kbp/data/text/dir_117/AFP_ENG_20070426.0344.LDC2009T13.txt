Rafael Nadal extended his record run on clay to 69 straight wins
as he moved a step closer to a title hat-trick at the
900,000-dollar Barcelona Open on Thursday.


The Spanish top seed beat former Australian Open champion Thomas
Johansson 6-1, 6-4, but not without a spirited comeback from the
Swede in a combatative second set of the third-round contest.


After riding roughshod over the number 73 in a 21-minute opener,
Nadal looked like having things all his own way.


But Johansson, 32, showed nerve as he re-disovered his survival
instincts to turn the second into a struggle at the Real club.


Johansson fired six aces and held serve in a marathon sixth game
featuring eight deuces.


But Nadal had the last word in front of his home public, breaking
for victory in the final game after Johansson followed an ace
with a run of errors.


It took 69 minutes for Nadal to go through.


The Spaniard is bidding to collect a hat-trick of Barcelona
titles, aiming to become the second man after Swede Mats Wilander
(1982-1984) to win the event three times on the trot.


"I controlled the game in the first set but he played well in the
second," said the winner. "I tried not to let up after winning
the first easily,


"It's unbelievable to win 69 on clay and it's especially nice to
play here, where I have so much support."


Nadal next faces Italian surprise packet Potito Starace, the
number 72 who beat Argentine eighth seed Juan Chela 6-4, 7-6
(12-10) in their third-round encounter.


Fifth seed David Ferrer flew the flag for Spain as he hammered
Serb Boris Pashanski 6-2, 7-5.


Nadal improved his Barcelona career record to 13-1, his lone loss
coming in 2003 when he was beaten as a teenager in the second
round by Alex Corretja.
