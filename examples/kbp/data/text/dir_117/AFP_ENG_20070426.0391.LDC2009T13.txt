Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres visited Croatia on
Thursday to discuss ties between the two countries which had been
frosty during Zagreb's nationalist regime in the 1990s.


"We talked about our excellent ties which are developing well and
I voiced my wish that as many Israeli investors as possible come
to Croatia," Prime Minister Ivo Sanader told journalists.


Peres had been informed about the Croatian government's efforts
to make it easier for both local and foreign investors to start
up businesses in the Balkan country, he added.


Peres also met President Stipe Mesic and is to give a lecture at
the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.


Before leaving Croatia on Friday, he is to travel to the southern
coastal town of Split.


Peres is the highest ranking Israeli official to have visited
Croatia since President Moshe Katsav came to the former Yugoslav
republic in 2003.


Relations between the two were strained during the 1990s rule of
Croatia's late autocratic president Franjo Tudjman, whom Israel
accused of failing to strongly denounce Croatia's pro-Nazi World
War II regime.


An estimated 75 percent of Croatia's 40,000 Jews were murdered by
the wartime regime.


Ties have improved since Stipe Mesic, a centrist, succeeded
Tudjman as president in 2000.


In 2006, Croatian exports to Israel amounted to 6.5 million
dollars (4.8 million euros) while imports totalled 26 million
dollars (19 million euros).
