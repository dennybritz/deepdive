French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen, facing stagnant sales in
Europe, said on Thursday it would cut 4,800 jobs in France this
year through voluntary departures and retirements.


"The company should be able to reduce staff without recourse to
... lay-offs," Peugeot said in a statement 10 days before the
final round of a presidential election in which corporate
restructuring and job cuts are a central issue.


It attributed the move "to a context marked by a stagnation in
sales in Europe over the last four years and a decline in
profitability."


Peugeot employs 122,000 people in France.


The group suffered a huge fall in net profit for 2006 but said
that a recovery plan would bring in better sales this year
particularly in China and Latin America.


It posted an 82.9-percent slide in 2006 net earnings to 176
million euros (229 million dollars) from 2005 as the company,
saddled with an ageing product line, fought stiff competition
from Asian carmakers.
