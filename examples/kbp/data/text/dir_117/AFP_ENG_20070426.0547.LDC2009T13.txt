A meningitis epidemic that has claimed 1,625 lives in the
impoverished west African nation of Burkina Faso since January is
gradually being brought under control, the health ministry said
Thursday.


"The situation as of April 18 is the following: there have been a
total of 24,633 cases recorded and the number of deaths is
1,625," said a report from the national committee managing the
fight against the disease.


But it also said that the epidemic was active in six districts as
opposed to 30 a month earlier, and the death rate had dropped
from eight percent in March to 6.6 percent so far this month due
to a nationwide vaccination campaign.


Meningitis is still plaguing the northern regions of Dori and
Gorom-Gorom, central Yako, Sapouy in the south and Kongoussi in
the east but the capital Ouagadougou has been taken off the list
of epidemic-hit zones, the report said.


Although Burkina Faso has by far the largest number of cases,
Benin, Chad, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Togo
have also been affected to differing degrees.


Burkina Faso, one of the world's poorest countries, is in the so-
called "meningitis belt" that runs from Senegal across the
southern Sahara to Ethiopia.


Meningitis, an airborne virus infecting the brain and spinal
cord, usually breaks out during the December-January dry season
when it is carried by warm, dry winds. Symptoms include fever,
rashes and vomiting.
