Romania is seeking to modernise its armed forces, Defence
Minister Teodor Melescanu announced on Thursday, saying he was in
the process of securing funds from the finance ministry.


"We have launched three major programmes to modernise the
equipment of the army, the air force and the navy," he told AFP
on the sidelines of an event marking the second anniversary of
Romania and Bulgaria signing their EU treaty of accession.


The aim is to make Romania's three infantry brigades operational
by equipping them with modern transport and communications
equipment, he said.


The ministry would replace the air force's MiG-21 fighters with a
multi-task aircraft, modernise navy frigates and purchase eight
corvettes.


Firms will be invited by the end of the year to tender for a
contract to replace the MiGs, he said.


The army is also seeking to buy armoured vehicles, produced by
Romania and Swiss specialist firm Mowag, and trucks.


Romania's 2007 defence budget is to cover part of the costs of
the programmes, but Melescanu said he was also negotiating with
the finance ministry to make off-budget purchases.


He gave no total figure for the cost of the modernisation.
