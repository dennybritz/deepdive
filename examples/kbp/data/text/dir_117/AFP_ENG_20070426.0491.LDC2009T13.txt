Truck owners said Thursday they are suspending supply of oil and
other goods from Pakistan to the US-led forces in Afghanistan
because armed gangs are harassing drivers.


A spokesman said groups of Afghans were demanding money from
drivers soon after they entered the country from Pakistan.


"We will stop transporting oil and other items to the US-led
forces in Afghanistan from Friday," the spokesman told a news
conference in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar.


"The ban will continue til our demand for ending extortion at the
hands of highway gangs is met," said Shakir Afridi on behalf of
dozens of truck owners from both countries.


"We are repeatedly stopped at several places from Torkham to
Jalalabad and forced to pay 'tax' at gun point," he said, adding
that the highway gangs subjected the drivers to violence if they
refuse to pay.


Armed groups were also operating on highways leading to the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar, eastern Khost and northern
Mazar-i-Sharif, he said.


"We took up the matter with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and
other concerned government officials, who promised to ensure
safety on roads, but the situation remains unchanged."


He said the situation had been better during the regime of
Taliban, who were ousted in a US-led invasion in 2001.


Security on highways has deteriorated amid a surge in Taliban-led
insurgency in southern and eastern Afghanistan over the past 15
months. Truck drivers have also been attacked and wounded by
Taliban loyalists.
