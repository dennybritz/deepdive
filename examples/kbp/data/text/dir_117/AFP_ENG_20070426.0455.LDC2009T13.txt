A far-right group was banned in Germany on Thursday after 200
police officers raided the homes of its members in the eastern
state of Saxony.


The group, known as Sturm 34, was a threat to society, said the
state's interior minister Albrecht Buttolo.


Sturm 34, named after a Nazi stormtrooper division based in the
area in World War II, had 50 known members and at least 100 other
followers and was believed to be capable of violence, the
minister said.


The raid uncovered starting pistols, helmets, masks, balaclavas
and extreme- right propaganda as well as computers and mobile
phones.


Police also swooped on 30 properties in the northern state of
Lower Saxony and the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia in a
bid to break up other far-right groups.


Germany's biggest far-right party, the strongly anti-immigration
National Democratic Party (NPD), caused shockwaves in the
mainstream German political establishment in 2004 when it won
more than nine percent of votes in state elections in Saxony.


But it failed to win a single seat in federal elections a year
later.


However, German authorities fear the far-right is gaining a
foothold by recruiting young members in economically depressed
areas of the former East Germany.
