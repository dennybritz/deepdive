Scores of students were injured Thursday in clashes with each
other and the police at Ethiopia's largest university, students
said.


One student said he saw another killed by demonstrators, and
around 50 wounded in the clashes at Addis Ababa University. Other
students also reported dozens of injured.


But federal police spokesman Demsash Hailu said no one had died,
although there had been some injuries.


There are "no dead, peace has been restored in the area," Demsash
said, adding that police reinforcements had bought the situation
under control.


Students and police said the riots began on campus Wednesday
evening, sparked by the alleged theft of the body organs of a
dead student by a government hospital.


"The doctors took over some of his body parts without any
authorisation from his family," a demonstrator, asking to remain
anonymous, told AFP.


"We asked the dean of the university to intervene but he refused.
That is why we are demonstrating."


Students also cited the poor quality of food served in the
university canteen as a reason for the riots.


University officials were unavailable for comment on Thursday.
