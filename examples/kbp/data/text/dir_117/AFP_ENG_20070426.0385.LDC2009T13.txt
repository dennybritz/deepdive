Welsh utility back Gareth Thomas found himself at the centre of a
club v country row on Thursday when Toulouse said they would
refuse to release him for Wales' summer tour to South Africa.


The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said they were confident that Thomas
would be available for the forthcoming two-Test tour to
Australia.


"This tour is IRB-sanctioned and approved, and under the
regulations he has to be released," said group chief executive
Roger Lewis.


"I don't see there being a problem. We are waiting for Toulouse
to respond."


Toulouse responded immediately, saying Thomas was expected to
fulfil his obligations to the club, currently third in the Top 14
and headed for a berth in the French championship play-offs.


"Toulouse does not for the moment agree to freeing Gareth Thomas
for the good reason that he is under contract until the end of
the season and that he must honour that until that date," said
club recruitment official Jean-Michel Rancoule.


Thomas, 32, is in his final season with Toulouse and has already
agreed a two- year deal to return to Wales to play for Cardiff
Blues next season.


Wales play Australia in the first Test in Sydney on May 26, the
same day Toulouse play their final Top 14 match away at Bourgoin.


The second Test is set for June 2 in Brisbane.
