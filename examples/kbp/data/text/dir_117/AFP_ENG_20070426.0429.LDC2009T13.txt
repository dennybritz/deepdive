An EU-US summit next week in Washington will set up a
transatlantic council to direct cooperation on issues such as
cosmetics testing and accounting rules, a draft declaration
obtained by AFP said.


The council will be founded when EU and US leaders meet on Monday
in Washington for a summit that will focus on climate change in
addition to improving economic cooperation.


The body will have the task of drawing up schedules and
monitoring operations aimed at meeting economic partnership
objectives agreed on by the two sides during EU-US summits.


One of the priorities this year and next will be to determine
regulations for cosmetics testing, with the aim of finding
alternatives to testing using animals.


Another priority would be to find answers to common concerns
about road safety and saving petrol.


The project also aims to make US accounting standards, known as
GAAP, and EU norms mutually recognized by 2009 without trying to
harmonize them.


The council is to be co-chaired on the European side by EU
Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen and experts in
transatlantic relations will be invited to its meetings to
provide recommendations.
