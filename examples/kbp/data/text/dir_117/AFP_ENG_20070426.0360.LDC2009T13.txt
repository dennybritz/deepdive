President Mary McAleese is to make a five-day visit to the United
States next week to strengthen links with the Irish community and
to promote trade and cultural links, her office said Thursday.


Her programme will begin on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia, where she
will meet state Governor Sonny Perdue and the Irish-American
community before departing for Syracuse, New York.


With her husband Martin, she will also visit New York City.


During her visit to New York she will receive the American
Ireland Fund Humanitarian Award for her reconciliation work with
Northern Ireland's communities.


The Belfast-born president will call on New York City's Mayor
Michael Bloomberg before returning to Dublin on May 5.
