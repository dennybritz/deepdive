Six central African countries plan to launch a common passport in
July, permitting the free movement of goods and people across
their borders, they said in a statement on Thursday.


The countries, which comprise the Central African Economic and
Monetary Community (CEMAC), agreed on the long-delayed common
passport during the bloc's summit this week in Chad.


The countries in the bloc are Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Chad,
Central African Republic, Cameroon and Congo.


Although the common passport was proposed at a 2003 summit, it
has still not been issued and visas are still needed to travel
between the countries.


A statement issued after the summit called for an urgent meeting
of ministers to deal with the delays.


Also during the summit, the six nations decided on changes to
their central bank, including sacking the bank's governor, Jean-
Felix Mamalepot of Gabon. The statement did not provide further
explanation.


A new governor has not yet been named for the bank, which is
responsible for issuing the bloc's currency.


Equatorial Guinea has long pushed for changes to the bank, asking
for a fairer distribution of capital requirements. The country, a
large oil producer, provides 60 percent of deposits and 40
percent of reserves for the bank.


Leaders also decided at the summit to contract with Brussels
Airlines as a strategic partner for a future airline, Air Cemac.
The new airline was announced in 2001, but has yet to be
launched.
