A legislator resigned Thursday from Turkey's ruling Justice and
Development Party (AKP) on the eve of a presidential vote in
parliament at which seat arithmetics could be crucial, party
sources said.


Hamza Albayrak's resignation is unrelated to the vote and was
motivated by allegations that the AKP failed to address
corruption charges at a party branch in northern Turkey.


AKP sources said he gave assurances that he would attend the
first round of voting on Friday and support the AKP candidate,
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.


His resignation leaves the AKP with 352 members in the 550-seat
parliament.


The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) says it will
boycott the vote and ask the Constitutional Court to annul it if
the quorum on Friday is not at least 367, the number of votes the
winner is required to garner in the first round.


If the CHP fails to block the vote, the AKP is almost certain to
elect Gul in the third round, when an absolute majority of 276
will suffice.


The CHP says the Islamist-rooted AKP is a threat to Turkey's
secular system and should not be allowed to elect a president on
its own.
