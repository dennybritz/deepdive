US President George W. Bush will meet with Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh on May 2 and with Singapore Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong on May 4, the White House announced Thursday.


"The president and President Saleh will discuss Yemen's recent
progress on political and economic reform and our joint efforts
on the war on terrorism," spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a
statement.


In a separate communique, Perino said that Bush, who visited
Singapore in November, "looks forward to discussing the full
range of regional and global issues with Prime Minister Lee."


"Singapore is one of our strongest partners in a critically
important region, a Free Trade Agreement partner, and an ally in
the war on terror and in coalition efforts in Iraq and
Afghanistan," she said.
