Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I think one of our challenges is to find a spinner, a spinner
who can help us going forward. Australia have one and so do Sri
Lanka. That is one facet of our game we always talk about."


- South Africa skipper Graeme Smith on the need for variety in
the attack following their semi-final defeat to Australia.


"We are not saying we are unbeatable. We certainly can be beaten
if we don't do things well."


- Australia skipper Ricky Ponting.


"The first hour was some of the craziest cricket South Africa
have ever played."


- Former South Africa batsman Daryl Cullinan after seeing Smith's
team collapse to 27-5 in the semi-final.


"I'm bowling really well around the wicket a lot at the moment
and that's a new tactic that can help me. It seems that when you
can't see which way the ball is going it's harder. People are
getting ready for the spin, so if I bowl the 'doosra' I might get
a top edge."


- Muttiah Muralitharan on his new approach in keeping batsmen
spellbound.


"There are a couple of younger guys coming through. I have been
busy playing cricket for the last ten years, it's now time to
move on and it'll be good to finish things off with a World Cup
win."


- Sri Lanka batsman Russel Arnold on his decision to retire from
cricket after the World Cup.
