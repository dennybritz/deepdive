Gunfire was heard near Sri Lanka's only international airport on
Thursday night, residents and officials said.


Residents also said they saw tracer bullets coming from the main
military airbase, which shares a runway with the Bandaranaike
international airport.


No further details were immediately available and the capital was
plunged into darkness by a power failure soon after the gunfire
was reported.


The airport complex was shut down after it came under air attack
from the Tamil Tiger rebels a month ago.
