Zimbabwe's annual rate of inflation, already the highest in the
world, rose to 2,200 percent last month, central bank governor
Gideon Gono said on Thursday.


"Year-on-year inflation which stood at 1,072.2 percent in October
rose to 11,281.1 percent in December and has risen to to 2,200
percent by March," Gono said in a televised statement.


Officials have twice postponed the announcement of the inflation
rate which has been the main cause of Zimbabwe's economic
meltdown.
