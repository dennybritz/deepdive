US General David Petraeus, commander of allied forces in Iraq,
Thursday acknowledged the complex situation in Iraq was "very
tough."


"The situation in Iraq is, in sum, exceedingly complex and very
tough. Success will take continued commitment, perseverance and
sacrifice," Petraeus told reporters.


The general said he would deliver an assessment in September of
the "surge" military strategy implemented since the beginning of
the year.


"During (Defense) Secretary (Robert) Gates' recent visit to Iraq
we agreed that in early September, (US) Ambassador Ryan Crocker
and I would provide an assessment of the situation in Iraq with
respect to our mission and offer recommendations on the way
ahead," he said.


Petraeus took his post at the beginning of the year, directed by
US President George W. Bush to implement the president's "surge"
strategy focused on increasing security in Baghdad, with the
dispatch of an additional nearly 30,000 US troops.
