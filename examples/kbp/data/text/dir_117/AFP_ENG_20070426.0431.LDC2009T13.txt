A multi-storey building collapsed Thursday in a residential
neighbourhood in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul and several
people were believed trapped under the wreckage, media reports
said.


Scores of ambulances and civil defence teams were dispatched to
the site in the district of Sirinevler, on the city's European
side, the NTV news channel reported.


Television footage showed people frantically trying to move big
chunks of concrete. A woman was seen weeping and shouting for
help.


Initial reports said the building had eight floors, but NTV and
the CNN Turk news channel later said it had six.
