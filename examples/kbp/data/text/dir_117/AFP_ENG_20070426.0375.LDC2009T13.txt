Interior ministers and high-ranking officials from six western
Balkan nations met in Budapest Thursday to boost cooperation
against organised crime, human trafficking and illegal
immigration.


Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia see
better cooperation in these areas as a prerequisite for European
integration.


"Cooperation has been weak and I think there is much need for
improvement," Albanian Interior Minister Bujar Nishani told AFP.


"All the countries in the region are focusing on the European
integration process and because of that we have to intensify our
dialogue, our exchanges and experiences and we have to be more
specific in the process of cooperation," he said.


Southeastern Europe is a major transit route for drug and human
trafficking and an important source of illegal immigration.


Hungary, which joined the European Union in 2004, has agreed to
share its experiences on strengthening border control and
fighting organised crime with western Balkan countries.
