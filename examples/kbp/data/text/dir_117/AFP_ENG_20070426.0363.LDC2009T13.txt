US shares, already riding record peaks, opened mostly higher
Thursday after energy heavyweight ExxonMobil reported better-
than-expected quarterly earnings topping nine billion dollars.


An improved financial report from struggling automaker Ford was
also welcomed by investors a day after the leading Dow Jones
Industrial Average stock index smashed the 13,000-point barrier
for the first time.


The Dow rose a slight 7.24 points, or 0.06 percent, to 13,097.13
just after the opening bell from a record close of 13,089.89
struck Wednesday.


Traders said such record highs were psychologically important for
the market and would likely help underpin robust trading
sentiment.


The tech-rich Nasdaq composite was up 2.25 points, 0.09 percent,
at 2,550.14, but the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index
dropped 1.12 points, 0.07 percent, to 1,494.30 in early deals.


Both indexes had closed at multi-year highs on Wednesday.


Shares gained after ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy
company, said its latest quarterly profits gushed to 9.28 billion
dollars as refining and marketing booms offset slower oil
earnings.
