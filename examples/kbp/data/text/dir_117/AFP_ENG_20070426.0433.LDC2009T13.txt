Iran's Quds Force funded, armed and trained a network of secret
Iraqi cells that kidnapped and killed five US soldiers in January
in Karbala, the top US commander in Iraq said Thursday.


General David Petraeus, however, said there was no concrete
evidence that the Iranians were directly involved in the January
20 raid on a security compound by men dressed in US military
style uniforms.


"There is no question that the Al-Qazhali network was connected
to the Iranian Quds Force -- received money, training, arms,
ammunition, and at some points in time even advice and
assistance," Petraeus said.
