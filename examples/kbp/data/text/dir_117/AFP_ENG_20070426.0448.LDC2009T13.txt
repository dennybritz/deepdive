A Roman Catholic bishop warned Thursday about the slow return of
ethnic Croats to homes in Bosnia's Serb entity that they fled
during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war.


"Out of 220,000 Catholics, now there are only 13,000" in
Republika Srpska, Bishop Franjo Komarica told journalists. A
majority of Bosnia's Catholics are Croats.


"Twelve years since the end of the war, these facts are killing
me," he said, blaming politicians.


The war between the three ethnic communities -- Croats, Muslims
and Serbs -- claimed some 200,000 lives while 2.2 million people,
or over half the population, had to flee their homes.


Some 500,000 Bosnians still live abroad and a similar number
remain displaced within the Balkan country, according to United
Nations figures.


In the first years after the war, refugees were unable to return
to areas dominated by another ethnic group.


However, under international pressure local authorities have
pressed on with the eviction of illegal occupants, thus enabling
pre-war owners to repossess their property.


Bosnian authorities have managed to return more than 90 percent
of property to their pre-war owners, but due to lack of jobs and
an ailing economy numerous refugees hesitate to return.


The war left Bosnia split into two largely autonomous entities --
the Serbs' Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.


Croats, who live mainly in the federation, make up 10 percent of
Bosnia's population of 3.8 million. Muslims and Serbs account for
40 and 31 percent respectively.
