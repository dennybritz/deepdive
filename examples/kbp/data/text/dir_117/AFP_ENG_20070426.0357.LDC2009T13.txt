Witnesses told an Indonesian court Thursday how they feared for
their lives as a gang of Christians swept through religiously
divided Poso searching for Muslims to kill.


Witness Daniel Bandue told the court in Jakarta that he watched
helplessly as the gang stormed into his house and dragged away
two Muslims trying to hide.


"I failed to save their lives because the attackers opened the
door by force and threatened me," Bandue told the judges.


He said he was unsure of the Muslims' fate but he feared they had
been killed in the sweep.


Another witness said his son had recounted how he saw the gang
drag two men into an alley near a high school and attack them.


Six witnesses were giving evidence in the trial of 12 Christians
accused of killing two Muslim fish traders, slitting the throat
of one and beating the other to death in Poso on Sulawesi island.


The gang set up roadblocks in September last year, hours after
three Christian militants had been executed for killing Muslims
during earlier bloody unrest in the district, the court has
heard.


Prosecutors have previously said the 12 dragged the two fish
traders from a truck before murdering them.


The pair were allegedly buried on a nearby mountain and their
truck pushed into a ravine. Their bodies were discovered two days
later.


Muslims and Christians live in roughly equal number in Poso and
have clashed often. Unrest there in 2000 and 2001 led to about
1,000 deaths and violence has flared periodically since then.
