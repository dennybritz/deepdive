EU lawmakers called on the Palestinian Authority and the European
Union to step up efforts to free BBC reporter Alan Johnston,
kidnapped in the Gaza Strip more than a month ago.


In a resolution, lawmakers urged the "Palestinian Authority and
the wider international community to re-double their efforts so
as to ensure the safe release of Alan Johnston."


Johnston was snatched at gunpoint as he drove home from work in
Gaza City on March 12. He has now been held for far longer than
any other Western hostage in the territory.


On April 15, a little-known Islamist group claimed in a statement
to have killed him, but Palestinian authorities have said there
was no proof of the claim by the Kataeb al-Jihad al-Tawheed (The
Brigades of Holy War and Unity).


Johnston, 44, was the only Western journalist left working full
time in the increasingly dangerous Gaza Strip when he was taken.
