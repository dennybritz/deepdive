Nigeria's president-elect Umar Yar'Adua is urging opposition
parties to set aside differences after the country's disputed
presidential and parliamentary polls and work together to bolster
economic progress.


"We must get our politics right, we must rise above partisan
political interest," to propel Africa's most populous nation of
140 million people from underdevelopment to industrialisation.


"This nation is greater than all of us, it is greater than any
political party and any individual", Yar'Adua told a group of
foreign journalists late Wednesday.


"We need the cooperation of everybody, no matter how small any
party, we need to get its cooperation to try to get this country
forward," he added.


Yar'Adua, who ran for the presidency on behalf of the ruling
People's Democratic Party (PDP) defeated 24 opposition candidates
in a flawed April 21 race slammed by foreign and domestic
monitors as failing to meet international standards of democracy.


He takes over on May 29, when President Olusegun Obasanjo bows
out after eight years.


The in-coming Nigeria leader said "I cannot say the election is a
setback for democracy.


"Once we follow the rule of law it is never a setback, people
should go the tribunals as our constitution allows and once we do
that it is a step forward not a setback."
