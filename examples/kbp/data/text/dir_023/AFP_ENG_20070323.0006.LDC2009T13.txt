China's newly crowned world figure skating champions Shen Xue and
Zhao Hongbo have announced wedding plans, China's Youth Daily
said Friday.


Zhao proposed to his long-time partner after they won the pairs
title at the world championships in Tokyo on Wednesday, it said.


"Everything was perfect," the paper quoted Zhao as saying. "So I
chose that moment to propose."


The plan is to get married next year, Zhao said shortly after he
and Shen were presented with their gold medals, according to the
report.


The announcement ended years of speculation about China's most
romantic sporting couple, whose chemistry on and off the ice has
fascinated Chinese fans.


"We never really knew what was going on between them," said the
paper. "We might have guessed but they never told us before."


Shen, 28, and Zhao, 33, have been partners for 14 years, winning
three world titles and collecting two Olympic bronze medals.
