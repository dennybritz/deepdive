A Senate committee on Thursday approved a draft emergency war
funding measure setting a March 2008 deadline for the withdrawal
of most of the US combat troops from Iraq.


The Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees US government
spending, approved the measure by a voice vote, as the House of
Representatives began debate Thursday of its own war spending
bill, with a similar provision for early troop withdrawal.
