The Blackstone Group, a giant private equity fund, announced a
partial US stock market flotation to raise four billion dollars,
according to a securities filing Thursday.


The move marks the first step into the world of publicly traded
and regulated stocks for a company at the heart of the boom in
private equity deals.


Blackstone said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange that
it intended to offer "limited partner interests" as part of the
initial public offering (IPO) in which it hoped to raise four
billion dollars.


Blackstone was founded with 400,000 dollars in 1985 by Peter
Peterson, a former White House aide and ex-chief executive of
Lehman Brothers, and Stephen Schwarzman, a former Lehman Brothers
mergers and acquisitions specialist.


Since then, it has mushroomed into a global firm and raised over
64 billion dollars in investments, a hefty chunk of which have
targeted private equity deals, according to Blackstone's website.


One of its most recent deals saw Blackstone win a 39-billion-
dollar bid to take over the largest US office management firm,
Equity Office Properties Trust (EOPT), in February.


The EOPT deal marked the most costly US private equity
transaction ever.
