Italian world champion Paolo Bettini has revealed he is
determined to race in this weekend's Milan-San Remo classic,
despite breaking a rib in a fall at the Tirreno-Adriatico a few
days ago.


A medical exam in Parma on Thursday revealed that the Quick Step
rider had broken a rib and torn his pectoral muscle.


"I have not dismissed the idea of making the Milan-San Remo start
line. This will be my 10th participation in a row and I hope to
be there to honour this mystical race in its 100th edition," said
Bettini.


"I can't promise that I will fight for the victory but I will
see, kilometre by kilometre, what role I can play in the race."


Quick Step's other team leader, Belgian Tom Boonen, who Bettini
deposed as world champion, is also suffering from a bad back and
is unlikely to be at 100 percent for the start of the first
classic of the season.
