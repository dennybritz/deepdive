Buenos Aires shares blame with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
for insulting US President George W. Bush during a recent Latin
tour, a US diplomat said Thursday.


"I don't think it was the right thing to do," the number-three at
the Department of State, Nicholas Burns, said at a gathering of
the Council of the Americas, a group of businesses promoting
their interests in Latin America.


Two weeks ago, Bush visited Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Guatemala
and Mexico, while Chavez, who claims Bush is the "devil," mounted
a road show of sorts to compete with Bush's message.


While Bush visited Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez in
neighboring Montevideo, Chavez denounced Bush policies before
protesters gathered in a stadium in Buenos Aires.


"I am sorry that that rally was held there on the same day that
our president was in Montevideo," Burns said.


Burns directed his next comment to Argentina's ambassador to
Washington, Jose Octavio Bordon, who was in the audience.


"I'm sorry to say that, Mr. ambassador, but that's the feeling
(of our government) about that," he said.


At the March 9 rally at a football stadium in Buenos Aires,
Chavez called Bush "political dead meat."
