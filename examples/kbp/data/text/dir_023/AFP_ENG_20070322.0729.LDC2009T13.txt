The eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is planning a
trip to France, according to news reports in Seoul.


South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting an unnamed diplomatic
source, said late Thursday that Kim Jong-Nam, 35, had applied for
a visa through the French embassy in Beijing.


Kookmin Daily said Kim used the alias of Kim Chol on his visa
application, which was submitted to the French embassy by a North
Korean embassy official posted in Beijing.


Kim was last seen at Beijing international airport on February
16, as he headed to North Korea to attend his father's 65th
birthday celebrations.


Yonhap said the younger Kim attempted in 2002 to visit France but
authorities in Paris refused to grant him a visa.


The South Korean news agency said he had previously made several
trips to France and had medical checkups there while he attended
a school in Geneva.


Kim was recently reported to have been living the high life in
Macau, a gambling haven in southern China, for most of the past
three years.


He is the son of Kim Jong-Il and actress Sung Hae-Rim and was
considered a possible candidate to succeed his father.


But the younger Kim is said to have lost his father's trust
following his embarrassing expulsion while trying to enter Japan
on a forged Dominican passport in 2001.


He reportedly told investigators he wanted to take his son to
Tokyo Disneyland.


Kim Jong-Il has two other sons, Jong-Chul, 23, and Jong-Woon, 20.
They were born to a different mother, Ko Yong-Hui, a former prima
donna in a dance troupe who died of lung cancer in 2005.
