Chinese share prices ended 0.93 percent lower in morning trade
Friday as profit- taking took the market of record highs hit on
Thursday, dealers said.


They said it was inevitable that there would profit-taking at
some point and the downturn was relatively modest given this
week's advance but investors were somewhat cautious too about the
introduction index futures.


The concern is that with stocks at record levels and plenty of
profits waiting to be taken, larger investors in particular could
use the futures to short the market, betting that it will fall
sharply once it goes into reverse.


Short sellers make their money by betting that stocks will fall.


"The market was under pressure as some investors locked in gains
after the key index lost momentum late afternoon yesterday," said
Wu Dazhong, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo Securities.


He said there were also "fresh concerns over upcoming index
futures which could add more volatility to the market.


"But I believe the correction will not last long as fresh money
is still flowing in on the back of a strong yuan and expectations
of growing corporate profits for this year," Wu noted.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, ended the morning down 28.61 points or 0.93 percent at
3,042.62.


The Shanghai A-share Index fell 30.08 points or 0.93 percent to
3,196.94 and the Shenzhen A-share Index lost 3.59 points or 0.43
percent at 840.46.
