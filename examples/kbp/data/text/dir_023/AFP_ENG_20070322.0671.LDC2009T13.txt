Sweden's Henrik Stenson and Australian Robert Allenby shared the
first-round lead in the WGC-CA Championship lead Thursday, with
defending champion Tiger Woods four adrift.


Stenson and Allenby both carded 5-under-par 67s on a damp day at
the Doral resort's "Blue Monster" course.


Denmark's Thomas Bjorn had sole possession of third place, one
shot back, while Aussie Aaron Baddeley, Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal and American Charles Howell were two back.


World No. 1 Woods, who is tied for 10th, was a winner on his last
two visits to this course as well as the defending champion of
the World Golf Championships event formerly known as the American
Express Championship.


Woods cruised to an eight-shot victory last year at The Grove in
England to claim the American Express title. He has won the event
four of the last five years, including the last two.


He has won two years running at Doral course, in the PGA Tour's
Ford Championship. Those tournaments featured a full 144-man
field.


Woods has only about half as many competitors at the CA
Championship, since it is an elite WGC event.


The newly renamed CA Championship is one of three tournaments
Woods has won five times along with the Buick Invitational and
the Bridgestone Invitational.
