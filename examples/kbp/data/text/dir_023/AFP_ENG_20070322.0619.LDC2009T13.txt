Shamed former Italian champions Juventus and Belgium's Standard
Liege are being investigated over possible fraud.


An Italian magistrate has travelled to Belgium as part of an
investigation into suspicious financial activities between the
Italians and Belgians, Belgian legal sources said Thursday.


Turin's deputy public prosecutor has reportedly questioned
Standard's vice- president Lucien D'Onofrio and former Standard
Liege and Juventus player Serhiy Kovalenko of the Ukraine over
the player's transfer to the Belgian side in 2005.


Italian authorities are keen to verify whether overpricing in the
sale of several Juventus players had occurred in order to hide
other cashflows from the club.


Other transfers highlighted for investigation are Uruguayan
international goalkeeper Fabian Carini and Nigerian striker
Benjamin Onwuachi, according to Belga press agency.


Carini, who was not a regular first team started for Juventus,
signed for Standard in 2002 from the Italian club for five
million euros. The Italian giants then bought him back for the
2003-2004 season only exchange him straight away for Inter Milan
defender Fabio Cannavaro.


Standard are also being investigated by Belgian authorities for
fraud and forgery.
