France has sidelined itself in the European Union and has instead
become consumed with its own internal politics, the last
surviving signatory of the Treaty of Rome said in an interview
published Friday.


The comments from Maurice Faure, then secretary of state at the
French foreign ministry, come in the run-up to the 50th
anniversary celebrations this weekend of the signing of the
treaty which founded the European Union.


"The countries of northern Europe, including Germany and Britain,
are now playing the leading role," Faure told the Financial
Times.


"Spain and Italy are joining them."


Events will take place across the 27-member EU to mark the half
century since the signing of the bloc's founding Treaty of Rome
by six countries on March 25, 1957.


In comments that seemingly illustrated his point, Faure spoke
also of his concern that when he attended the 50th anniversary
celebrations in Berlin, he would not be able to understand what
is being said.


"They won't be speaking French. When we were preparing the Treaty
of Rome, we only spoke French."
