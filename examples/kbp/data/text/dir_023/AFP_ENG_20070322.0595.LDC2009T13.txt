US President George W. Bush on Thursday urged leaders of Northern
Ireland's main political factions to reach a deal by Monday on a
power-sharing deal and a new government, the White House said.


Bush telephoned Ian Paisley, the firebrand Protestant leader of
the conservative Democratic Unionists (DUP), and Gerry Adams,
leader of Roman Catholic socialists Sinn Fein -- the political
wing of violence-renouncing paramilitaries the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), said spokesman Gordon Johndroe.


"President Bush thanked both leaders for the steps they have
taken to advance the peace process in Northern Ireland," Johndroe
said in a statement.


"He urged them to take the final steps to reach agreement by
March 26 on a new government for Northen Ireland, and to work
together to build a future of peace and prosperity for the people
of Northern Ireland," said the spokesman.


If the parties cannot agree on forming a power-sharing executive
by midnight Monday, then Northern Ireland's assembly will be
axed, a British financial aid package dropped and the province
governed indefinitely from London.


The DUP topped the March 7 Northern Ireland Assembly polls, with
Sinn Fein -- the former political wing of the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) -- coming second.


The British and Irish governments want to restore self-rule in
Belfast nearly a decade after the 1998 Good Friday Agreeement,
which ended three decades of bloody Troubles between Catholics
and Protestants.
