Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva eased rules on
importing genetically modified agricultural organisms, the
official news agency said.


The presidential green light given late Wednesday could most
immediately benefit Germany's Bayer, which has sought approval
for a variety of genetically modified corn.


It came after a bare majority of the 27 members of the National
Technical Biosecurity Commission gave their backing for the
commercialization of just one transgenic crop.


But at the same time Lula vetoed the commercialization of
genetically modified cotton, which has already been planted
illicitly in 2006 on some 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres) in
Brazil.


Despite political opposition, transgenic soybeans were
provisionally approved in Brazil in 2004 and approval has been
renewed annually. The government relinquished oversight after
many farmers were found to have been planting genetically
modified crops in southern Brazil.


About 10 genetically modified crops from Monsanto, Syngenta,
Bayer and Dow Agroscience, mainly corn varieties, have been
awaiting approval from the biosecurity commission.


The International Biotechnology Agricultural Purchasing and
Application Service (ISAAA) says modified cotton and soybean
crops cover 11.4 million hectares (28 million acres) of Brazil in
2006, a rise of 2.1 million hectares (5.0 million acres).
