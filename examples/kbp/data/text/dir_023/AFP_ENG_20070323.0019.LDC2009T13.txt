A major petrol tank explosion in central Vietnam killed four
workers and badly injured four others, police said Friday, in an
accident apparently caused by workers using welding equipment.


The blast in Danang city on Thursday ripped through a 12,500
-cubic-metre tank at the Nuoc Man depot of state-run Petrolimex,
said a police officer near the site.


Three workers died immediately when residual fuel exploded during
maintenance work and one died later in a local hospital. Four
other workers were being treated for severe burns and other
injuries.
