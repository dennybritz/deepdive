A US federal judge on Thursday upheld a veto on a child-
protection law targeting Internet pornography, ruling that it
violated freedom of expression and other constitutional rights.


Judge Lowell Reed ruled that an earlier suspension of the 1998
law, which penalizes those publishing material deemed harmful to
children for "commercial" ends, should be upheld indefinitely
since the law was too vaguely worded.


The law allowed six-month jail terms and fines of 50,000 dollars
(37,500 euros) for anyone who "makes any communication for
commercial purposes that is available to any minor and that
includes any material that is harmful to minors."


This wording drew criticism from parties including civil
liberties groups, writers, artists, condom manufacturers, a gay
magazine and a website providing sex education for young people.


"I may not turn a blind eye to the law in order to attempt to
satisfy my urge to protect this nation's youth by upholding a
flawed statute, especially when a more effective and less
restrictive alternative is readily available," Reed said.


He had first suspended the bill in 1999 to carry out an
assessment, which resulted in Thursday's ruling that the law in
its current form violated several constitutional rights.


In 2004, bill supporters failed to have the ban lifted in an
appeal to the Supreme Court.


The government can now either appeal again to the Supreme Court,
or work with Congress to draft a more precisely worded text.
