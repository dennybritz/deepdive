A waste disposal firm that operated an illegal dump on an Indian
reservation in southern California has been ordered to pay more
than 46 million dollars in clean-up costs, officials said
Thursday.


A statement from the Justice Department and Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) said Lawson Enterprises must pay nearly
43 million dollars to clean the site along with three million
dollars in civil penalties.


The order was made by United States District Court judge Stephen
Larson following a four-year legal battle surrounding the dump on
the Torres Martinez Reservation in the Coachella Valley, 200
kilometers (125 miles) east of Los Angeles.


"This legal victory makes it loud and clear -- open dumping on
tribal lands is a crime," said EPA official Wayne Nastri.


Lawson Enterprises operated the solid-waste disposal dump from
1992 to 2006, burning waste until 2003.


Smoke from the dump affected surrounding schools, where students
were restricted from open-air activities and reported health
problems including headaches and stomachaches. Local fire
services also had to tackle numerous fires that broke out at the
dump, officials said.


Earlier this month a court in San Francisco ruled that a ski
resort's plan to spray artificial snow made with treated sewage
on mountains and parkland revered by Native American tribes was
unlawful.
