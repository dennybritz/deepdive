Schoolgirl star Michelle Wie will miss the first major of the
LPGA season, next week's Kraft Nabisco Championship at Rancho
Mirage, California, as she continues to recover from a wrist
injury.


"Unfortunately, Michelle will be unable to play in the Kraft
Nabisco Championship this year," a statement from public
relations firm Ken Sunshine Consultants said Thursday. "While the
rehabilitation of her wrist is on schedule, Michelle wants to
make sure she gives fans everything she can the next time she
steps on the course. She's not there yet."


The 17-year-old Korean-American from Hawaii, who has already
played in four Kraft Nabisco Championships, hurt her wrist in a
fall last month.


At the time the expected rehabilitation time frame put her
participation in the Kraft in jeopardy.


"We are greatly disappointed she is not able to play," tournament
director Terry Wilcox told the Desert Sun newspaper. "But we are
completely sympathetic with her decision."


Wie tied for third in the event last year, just missing out on
joining eventual champion Karrie Webb of Australia and Mexico's
Lorena Ochoa in a playoff.


As a 13-year-old amateur in 2003, Wie finished tied for ninth in
her debut in the event.


Wie is still in search of her first LPGA title and has yet to
achieve her goal of making a cut against top male professionals
in a US PGA Tour event.
