US equity firm Carlyle has agreed to buy a 45-percent stake in
Chinese machinery maker Xugong for the same price it offered in
October for 50 percent, Xugong's listed arm said Friday.


Carlyle will still pay 1.8 billion yuan (233 million dollars) for
the reduced stake in Xugong Construction Machinery, according to
the statement filed by Xugong Technology with the Shenzhen stock
exchange.


According to a revised agreement the parties signed last week,
Carlyle will first pay 1.22 billion yuan for 35.6 percent of
Xugong and then inject another 584 million yuan into the company,
raising its stake to 45 percent.


This has led to the second price rise in Carlyle's bid for
Xugong.


The Chinese government rejected Carlyle's initial offer in
October 2005 of buying an 85-percent stake in Xugong for 375
million dollars as fears were rising over foreign control in a
key Chinese industry.


Carlyle was later forced to revise its plan and pay 1.8 billion
yuan for 50 percent of the company.


Xugong Construction Machinery is a subsidiary of the Xugong
Construction Machinery Group, which is controlled by the
government of Xuzhou city, in eastern China's Jiangsu province.
