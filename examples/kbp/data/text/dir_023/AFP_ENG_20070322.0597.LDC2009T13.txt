A Nigerian anti-human trafficking agency on Thursday handed over
to Benin authorities 19 rescued teenagers suspected to be victims
of child trafficking, private AIT television reported here.


The teenagers, who were rescued between January and February this
year by Nigerian security officials in the country's southwest
Ogun State, were handed over to officials of Benin embassy, said
AIT which showed footage of the children.


Representatives of the UN Chidren Fund (UNICEF) witnessed the
ceremony when officials of the state-backed National Agency for
the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons (NAPTIP) handed over the 19
teenagers to Benin officials, AIT said.


UNICEF is providing technical and financial support to assist
with the rehabilitation and health care for victims of
trafficking.


Children are allegedly being trafficked in Nigeria either for
forced labour or for prostitution, officials said.


A 2003 Federal Office of Statistics and ILO national child labour
survey estimated that there were 15 million children engaged in
child labour in Nigeria.


The Nigerian parliament in July 2003 promulgated a law that
prohibits human and child trafficking in the country.
