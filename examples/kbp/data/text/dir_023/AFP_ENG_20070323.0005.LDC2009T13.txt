One policeman and one communist rebel were killed Friday in
separate incidents in the Philippines, in the latest violence
linked to the guerrillas' nearly four-decade-long insurgency,
officials said.


Three suspected members of the New People's Army (NPA) shot dead
the chief of the local police intelligence unit in Daraga town,
southeast of Manila, as he rode his motorcycle home, said police
chief Senior Inspector Joe Capinpin.


The attackers then stole the victim's motorbike and sped off, the
spokesman added.


Elsewhere, government troops clashed with NPA insurgents in San
Juan town south of the capital, killing one rebel and wounding
three others, said army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto
Torres.


The 7,000-member NPA, the guerrilla unit of the Communist Party
of the Philippines, has been waging a Maoist insurgency to seize
power in the Philippines for nearly 40 years.
