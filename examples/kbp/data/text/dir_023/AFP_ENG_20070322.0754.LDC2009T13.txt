Kobe Bryant's National Basketball Association scoring rampage
continued Thursday as he poured in 60 points to lead the Los
Angeles Lakers to a 121-119 victory over Memphis.


It was Bryant's third straight consecutive game of at least 50
points.


The superstar connected on 20-of-37 shots and made 17-of-18 free
throws to record his 17th career 50-point performance, tying Hall
of Famer Elgin Baylor for most all-time in Lakers history.


A nine-time All-Star, Bryant also became the first Laker to
register three straight contests with at least 50 points since
Baylor did so during the 1962-63 campaign.


In two wins at the Staples Center this past weekend, Bryant
netted 65 points against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday,
then scored 50 against the Minnesota Timberwolves a day later.


Bryant also added his name to the NBA record books, tying Michael
Jordan for second all-time for the most 60-point games with four.


This rivals Bryant's most impressive sustained display of scoring
since he poured in at least 40 points in nine straight games
during 2002-03 season.
