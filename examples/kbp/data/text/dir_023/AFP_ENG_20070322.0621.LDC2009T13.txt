Austrian-born celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck announced Thursday his
food and restaurant empire would drop foie gras from its menus as
part of a drive against animal cruelty.


Puck, whose catering group boasts world-famous Los Angeles
restaurant Spago amongst more than 100 other eateries, including
several in Japan, said from now on only animals reared humanely
would be used by his company.


"Our guests want to know the meals they eat in my restaurants are
made with fresh, natural, organic ingredients," said Puck, who
often handles catering at high-profile Oscars award events.


"They want to know where the produce comes from and how the
animals are raised."


As part of the drive, Puck put together an animal treatment
program in partnership with the Humane Society of the United
States and the Farm Sanctuary, an animal-protection pressure
group, the statement said.


The nine-point program aims to end to some of the most
controversial practices associated with factory farming, it
added.


The program's provisions include a pledge to only use eggs from
cage-free hens as well as a ban on pork and veal that comes from
pigs and calves kept in cages that prevent turning or walking.


Foie gras, the delicacy made from force-feeding ducks, would be
eliminated from menus as would seafood that has not been
certified as sustainable.


"We want a better standard for living creatures. It's as simple
as that," Puck added in the statement.


Farm Sanctuary has protested Puck's restaurant and food chain in
recent years over its use of veal and foie gras.
