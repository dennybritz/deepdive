Hong Kong share prices finished the Friday morning session 0.15
percent weaker on mild profit-taking following recent gains in
the run-up to results announcements by some of the top local
companies, dealers said.


They said the buying momentum has dissipated as most of the major
results are now in, leaving investors to wait for fresh leads.


The index market rose more than 700 points over the last four
days in the run-up to results from the likes of China Mobile,
Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whapmoa.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning down 29.68 points at
19,660.57, off a low of 19,634.11 and a high of 19,729.49.
