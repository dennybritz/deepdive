One person was confirmed dead and eight others were missing after
a fishing boat capsized off the southeast coast of South Korea
early Friday, marine police said.


The 59-ton boat went down while fishing about three miles off
Hong Island. An Indonesian and a South Korean crew member were
rescued but the Korean died on the way to hospital. The
Indonesian is receiving medical treatment.


Eight others, including another Indonesian and one Chinese, are
missing, the police said.


The boat was trawling for anchovies with another fishing boat.
Police said they are stepping up rescue efforts but the number of
dead may increase.
