The United Nations peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic
of Congo evacuated over six hundred people from an area of
Kinshasa caught up in fierce fighting on Thursday.


Those taken to safety included UN personnel, foreign embassy
staff, school children and wounded civilians, said Lieutenant
Colonel Didier Rancher, a military spokesman for the UN mission
in the DRC (MONUC).


Fighting erupted on Thursday between government troops and guards
of last year's loser in the presidential election, Jean-Pierre
Bemba, and continued into the evening.


"This evening, there is a building on fire with people on the top
floors. We're in the process of sending help," Rancher said
describing the scene in the northern Gombe district of the city
where the fighting raged most of the day.


At least two people have been killed and dozens injured,
including the Nigerian ambassador, according to another MONUC
source.
