Religious leaders on Thursday joined Mexico's conservative
government in vocally opposing proposed legislation to legalize
abortion in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.


Members of several Christian denominations protested outside
Mexico City's legislative building, and Roman Catholic Church
leaders warned that any deputy voting in favor of the proposed
bills would be excommunicated.


The opposition-led Mexico City legislative assembly was scheduled
to vote in April on a new bill that would allow abortion within
the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and leftist senators planned to
present a similar proposal in the federal senate.


Tonatiuh Gonzalez, one of the authors of the bill and a member of
the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) expressed
certainty the measure would be approved in Mexico City, where he
said only 19 of the 66 legislators opposed it.


The National Action Party (PAN) of President Felipe Calderon
staunchly opposes the proposals.


About 100,000 women undergo abortion every year in Mexico,
according to official figures. Some non-governmental
organizations say the figure is as high as 500,000.


PAN legislator Armando Martinez insisted there was no need to
change legislation as "only 43 women died of abortion last year."
He also suggested adoption as an alternative to abortion.
