Malaysia and the European Union have signed an aviation pact
which will allow all airlines from any country in the bloc to fly
to the southeast Asian nation, state media said.


Under the agreement, at least 200 European airlines, including
those running charter services, will be able to fly to Malaysia,
the official Bernama news agency reported.


"The agreement removes nationality restrictions in bilateral air
service agreements between EU member states and Malaysia,"
Transport Minister Chan Kong Choy told Bernama from Brussels late
Thursday after signing the deal.


"This means that any EU airline, not only national flag carriers,
will be allowed to operate flights between the EU and Malaysia,"
he said.


The pact does not replace bilateral air service agreements but
will bring them into line with EU laws by removing nationality
restrictions, Bernama said.


Singapore and the European Union signed a similar agreement in
June last year, the first of its kind between the EU and an Asian
country.
