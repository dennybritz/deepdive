Wall Street shares ended mixed Thursday as the market digested a
powerful rally a day earlier fueled by what some analysts said
was a Federal Reserve hint of an easier money policy soon.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 13.46 points (0.11
percent) to 12,460.98 at the closing bell after a big 1.3 percent
gain on Wednesday.


The Nasdaq composite dropped 4.18 points (0.17 percent) to
2,451.74 while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 lost a
fractional 0.39 points (0.03 percent) to a preliminary close of
1,434.65.


The stock market was consolidating a day after shooting higher in
the wake of the Fed decision to hold rates steady. The central
bank eliminated a reference to "firming" or hiking rates in its
latest policy statement, saying instead it would make "future
policy adjustments" based on incoming data.


"The market was pleased to see (the Fed) hold off on any rate
increases in response" to inflation, said Fred Dickson at DA
Davidson.


But Dick Green at Briefing.com said Wednesday's sharp rally
appears to have been an overreaction to the Fed, and pondered
whether the market may be too eagerly anticipating a rate cut.


"The (Fed) statement did remove the bias towards tightening, but
there was no hint of any rate cut soon. It was modestly positive
news at best," he said.
