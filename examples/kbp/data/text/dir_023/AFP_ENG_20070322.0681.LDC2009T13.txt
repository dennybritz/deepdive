Sponsors of a UN Security Council measure to reinforce sanctions
against Iran for its nuclear program are ready to put it to a
vote, likely Saturday, after having amended the text, UN
diplomats said late Thursday.


Council permanent members the United States, Britain and France
signaled the text was ready for a vote after "seven or eight"
changes were made after requests by South Africa, Indonesia and
Qatar, said Britain's UN ambassador Emyr Jones Parry.
