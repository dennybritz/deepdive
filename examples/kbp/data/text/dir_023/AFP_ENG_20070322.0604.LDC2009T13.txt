Portugal will invest 8.1 billion euros (10.8 billion dollars)
until 2012 to develop renewable energy projects that will create
around 10,000 jobs, a senior government official said on
Thursday.


The investment in windpower infrastructure alone will be of 1.7
billion euros, Antonio Castro Guerra told reporters on the
sidelines of the opening of a biomass plant near the central town
of Castelo Branco.


The plant can produce 80 gigawatts per hour or enough energy for
70,000 people.


In January Prime Minister Jose Socrates said Portugal would
strive to have renewable energy account for 45 percent of its
electricity output by 2010, up from 36 percent in 2005, the last
year for which figures are available.


If the target is met the country will lead alternative energy use
in the 27-nation European Union, alongside Austria and Sweden.


The government wants biofuels to account for 10 percent of all
fuel used for transportation by 2010, a decade before EU member
states must meet this target.


Portugal is heavily dependent on imported energy but has stepped
up its efforts to develop renewable energy like wind, wave and
solar power since Socrates' government came to power in March
2005.
