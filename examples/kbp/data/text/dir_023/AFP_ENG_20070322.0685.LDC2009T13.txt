The chief of Russia's mufti council protested Thursday against
the construction of a Christian Orthodox chapel at the site of
the Beslan school hostage tragedy in which 332 people lost their
lives, including 186 children.


"We visited Beslan's ruined school and saw an Orthodox cross in
the gym (where hostages were held on September 1-3, 2004), but
did not see a crescent anywhere to signify our common grief,"
Ravil Gainutdin said as quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency.


"This is unfair to Muslims, who also were victims of this
terrorist act and who mourn together with everyone," he added.


Gainutdin said he had already raised the issue on Patriarch Alexy
II, stressing that "this is our common tragedy, and there should
be a memorial that would be one for all, not one that would
divide us."


The idea of constructing a Christian church at the site was
initiated by the Orthodox Bishop Theophan of Stavropol and
Vladikavkaz, who was present in Beslan the entire time of the
hostage drama and has frequently visited the North Ossetian town
since then.
