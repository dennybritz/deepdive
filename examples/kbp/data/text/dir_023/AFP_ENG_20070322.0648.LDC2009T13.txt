The United States is closely watching a political challenge to
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf over his suspension of the
nation's chief justice, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said
Thursday.


Gates said that he had been told that formal charges will be
brought later against Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who is
accused of having used his clout to get promotions for his son.


"We are clearly watching the situation in Pakistan," Gates told
reporters, adding "we'll just have to see what those charges
are."


Musharraf's suspension of Chaudhry has sparked nationwide
protests by lawyers.
