US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday he was concerned
about Afghanistan's release of Taliban fighters to gain the
freedom of an Italian journalist being held hostage.


"This was between the Afghan government and the Italians," Gates
said, adding that while the United States had influence in Kabul
it had no authority to stop the deal.


War correspondent Daniele Mastrogiacomo, 52, of the Italian daily
La Repubblica, was released Monday after two weeks in captivity
in exchange for the release of five Taliban militants.


Asked whether he was concerned about a deal that left Taliban
fighters free to resume attacks on coalition force, Gates said,
"Yes."


He did not elaborate.


Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said he did not regret
saving the life of Mastrogiacomo, who witnessed the beheading of
his Afghan driver before being released on Monday.


"It's preferable to have a dispute over the fact that we saved
him, rather than to have one over having had him killed," D'Alema
said.


He spoke by telephone with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
after the United States, Britain and the Netherlands said the
swap could invite similar kidnappings of NATO and Afghan troops
battling the Taliban.
