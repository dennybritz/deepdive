Rookie Tyrus Thomas tipped in the game-winner with two-tenths of
a second left to give the Chicago Bulls a 109-108 National
Basketball Association victory over Denver on Thursday.


Ben Gordon scored 25 points and Luol Deng chipped in 22 and 14
rebounds for the Bulls, who avenged their 113-109 loss to Denver
on November 21. The Nuggets, meanwhile, had a second-high five-
game winning streak snapped.


In the fourth quarter, Gordon drained a pull-up jumper in the
lane to help the Bulls take a 107-106 with 23 seconds.


However, superstar Allen Iverson answered back with a driving
layup 10 seconds later as the Nuggets regained the lead to set up
Thomas' heroics.


After Gordon missed a jumper from the baseline, Deng kept the
ball alive on the glass as Thomas raced through the lane to score
the go-head basket, ending Chicago's two-game slide.


Iverson scored 31 points and Carmelo Anthony added 28 for the
Nuggets, who shot 55 percent from the floor but committed 22
turnovers.


With the loss, the Nuggets fell one game behind the Los Angeles
Lakers for sixth place in the Western Conference standings.
