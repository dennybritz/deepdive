Marshall Faulk, one of the most versatile running backs in
National Football League history, has scheduled a news conference
for Monday and is expected to announce his retirement.


Faulk, 34, did not play last season for the St. Louis Rams after
undergoing reconstructive knee surgery and was hired as an
analyst by the NFL Network.


A seven-time Pro Bowler, Faulk is ninth on the NFL's all-time
rushing list with 12,279 yards and sixth in all-purpose yards
with 19,190.


But Faulk's last 1,000-yard rushing season was back in 2001 and
he served primarily as a backup to Steven Jackson in 2004 and
2005.


Faulk carried only 65 times for 292 yards in 2005, but was still
a threat as a third-down back with 44 catches.


The Rams acquired Faulk from the Indianapolis Colts in 1999 for
two draft picks in what stands as perhaps the best trade in
franchise history.


He helped the Rams win the Super Bowl in his first season, earned
NFL Most Valuable Player honors in 2000 and helped them reach the
Super Bowl again in 2001.


The only player in NFL history with more than 2,000 combined
rushing and receiving yards in four straight seasons (1998-2001),
Faulk is fourth all-time with 136 touchdowns.
