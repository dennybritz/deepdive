A Japanese court convicted two accountants Friday for their role
in the financial scandal at the once-high flying Internet  firm
Livedoor Co.


The Tokyo District Court sentenced Taishin Hisano, 42, to 10
months in jail and gave Motoshi Kobayashi, 52, a one year
suspended prison term for colluding with former Livedoor
executives to conceal losses at the company.


The pair, who worked for now-defunct auditing firm Koyo and Co,
have both maintained their innocence.


But presiding Judge Toshiyuki Kosaka said the two accountants had
knowingly taken part in the fraud with the intention of retaining
an important client.


Prosecutors had demanded one year and six months in prison for
each defendant.


The ruling follows the convictions of Livedoor founder Takafumi
Horie and four other executives over a scandal that briefly
caused panic on the Tokyo stock market last year, forcing it to
close early for the first time ever.


Japan's Fuji Television Network, a reluctant shareholder in
Livedoor after a bruising takeover battle, said Friday that it
would file a lawsuit against the Internet firm if the company
itself is found guilty of fraud.


Fuji Television reluctantly bought 12.75 percent of the shares in
Livedoor in a humiliating truce in 2005 after a two-month
takeover battle.
