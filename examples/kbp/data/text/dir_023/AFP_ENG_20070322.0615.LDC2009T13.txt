US authorities said on Thursday they are searching for an Iraqi
colonel, who went missing with his family while attending a
military training course in Alabama.


The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said it "does not
suspect foul play in the disappearance."


"There is no indication that this student is a national security
or public safety concern," ICE said in a statement.


"ICE has joined the investigation into the whereabouts of an
Iraqi military student, his wife and two young children who
disappeared while attending a US Department of Defense training
course in Alabama," the statement said.


The Washington Times daily said the colonel had left a note
stating he had abandoned the year-long military course because he
did not want to return to war-torn Iraq.


It said the officer was studying at the Maxwell Air Force Base,
Alabama, in a leadership course that is part of US efforts to
rebuild the Iraqi air force.


A spokesman for the US Air Force confirmed the missing man is an
Iraqi colonel, but did not immediately give further details of
the case.
