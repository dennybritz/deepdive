Sri Lankan troops shot dead at least 13 Tamil Tiger rebels who
tried to attack military positions in the island's north, the
defence ministry said Friday.


Security forces opened fire late Thursday on suspected members of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at Omanthai on the de
facto border with rebel-held territory, killing 11 of them, the
ministry said in a statement.


It said another two rebels were shot dead further north at
Nagarkovil in the Jaffna peninsula on the same day. There were no
reports of troop casualties.


The violence came as troops carried out clearing operations in
the east of the island after simultaneous Tamil Tiger attacks
left at least 20 people dead and dozens more wounded on
Wednesday, officials said.


There was no immediate word on the fighting from the LTTE, which
has been waging a separatist war since 1972, about the latest
military claims.


Official figures show that nearly 150,000 people were listed as
internally displaced in the eastern district of Batticaloa since
the military captured a key Tiger base there in January.


Since then, the military has also stepped up attacks against
rebel boats and claimed it sank three large supply ships that
were allegedly trying to smuggle weapons into the island nation.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
in Sri Lanka since December 2005. The violence comes despite a
truce in place since February 2002.
