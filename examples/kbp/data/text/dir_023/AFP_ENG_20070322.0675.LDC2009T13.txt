Philadelphia Flyers forward Todd Fedoruk was released from
hospital Thursday, one day after being knocked out in a fight
with New York's Colton Orr.


Just 21 seconds into Wednesday's National Hockey League game
against the Rangers, the 28-year-old Canadian engaged in a fight
with Rangers Orr and received a blow to the chin that knocked him
down.


The back of Fedoruk's head slammed on the ice as he fell,
knocking him unconscious and prompting a member of the Flyers'
medical staff to race to the scene.


After several minutes, a stretcher was brought out for Fedoruk,
who was carried from the ice and taken to hospital for
observation.


Diagnosed with a concussion, the Fedoruk spent the night in the
hospital but felt much better Thursday morning.


"I got a good rest last night," Fedoruk said. "Everything came
back, everything was positive, all the tests and stuff like that.
I feel good today and I am glad to be back in Philly."


Acquired from Anaheim on November 13, Fedoruk suffered an injury
in a fight while with the Ducks that required plates to be placed
in his face.
