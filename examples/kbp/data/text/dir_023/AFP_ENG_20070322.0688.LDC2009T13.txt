Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was murdered, a police
spokesman said here Thursday.


"After examining the pathology report, the results showed that
Mr. Woolmer died as a result of asphyxiation as a result of being
strangled," said Karl Angell, the director of communications for
the Jamaican police force.


The police statement followed similar reports in two Jamaican
newspapers on the cause of the 58-year-old Woolmer's death on
Sunday.


Woolmer died in hospital on Sunday after being found unconscious
in his hotel room a day after Pakistan were knocked out of the
World Cup following a shock defeat by minnows Ireland.
