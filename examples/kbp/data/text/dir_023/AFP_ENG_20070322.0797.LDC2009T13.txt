A former East Timor cabinet minister has appealed his seven-year
jail sentence for weapons offences, reports said Friday.


Former home affairs minister Rogerio Lobato was jailed on March 7
for illegally distributing weapons to civilians during unrest
last year that left 37 people dead and caused 150,000 to flee.


His lawyer Paulo dos Remedios filed an appeal on Thursday and
said the court in the capital, Dili, had erred in its judgement,
the Timor Post newspaper reported.


"The Dili district court had made many mistakes ... we appeal
with a stronger case and hope that the appeal court can change
the sentence," he was quoted as saying.


UN police in East Timor boosted their presence in the capital
over fears of rowdy protests by Lobato's many supporters after he
was sentenced.


The former minister founded a guerrilla army that fought
Indonesia's 24-year occupation of East Timor, which lasted until
1999. He was placed under house arrest pending the appeal.


East Timor is one of the world's newest and poorest nations. It
is scheduled to hold presidential elections on April 9, with
thousands of police officers to be mobilised amid fears of
violence.
