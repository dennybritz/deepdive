Defeated Democratic Republic of Congo presidential candidate
Jean-Pierre Bemba has taken temporary refuge in the South African
embassy in Kinshasa after a day of fighting between his guards
and government troops, the embassy said Thursday.


"Mr. Bemba has been taken in temporarily. He absolutely has not
made any demand for asylum," the embassy's deputy ambassador,
Kenneth Pedro, told AFP.
