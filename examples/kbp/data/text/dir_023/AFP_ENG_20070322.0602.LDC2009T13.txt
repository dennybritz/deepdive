French oil group Total confirmed on Thursday that its chief
executive Christophe de Margerie had been put under judicial
investigation by a French judge.


"After being held for questionning, Christophe de Margerie, chief
executive officer of Total, has left the judge's office after
being placed under formal investigation," a statement from the
company said.


A legal source told AFP that Margerie had been put under
investigation for suspected "corruption of foreign public agents
and misuse of corporate assets."


The French oil company is suspected of paying top Iranian
officials nearly 100 million Swiss francs (60 million euros, 80
million dollars) through two Swiss bank accounts to win a
contract in 1997.


Total reiterated that it had signed the deal in Iran "in
compliance with applicable law."


"The group is confident in its belief that the investigation will
establish the absence of any illegal activities," it said.
