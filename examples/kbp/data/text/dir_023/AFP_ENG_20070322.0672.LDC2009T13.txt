Unseeded Yaroslava Shvedova beat Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia
6-3, 6-1 in the first round of the ATP/WTA Miami Masters Series
event on Wednesday.


The hard-serving Shvedova, who has a 9-4 match record this year,
advanced to the second round where she will face 12th seeded
Serbian Ana Ivanovic.


The 19-year-old Russian won her maiden WTA singles title last
month at the Bangalore Open in India, upsetting No 2 seed Sania
Mirza and No 7 seed Tamarine Tanasugarn en route to the
championship.


In the Bangalore final the unseeded Shvedova beat Italian top
seed and defending champ Mara Santangelo 6-4 6-4.


Rain created problems at the Miami tournament for the second-
straight day. Shvedova and Cibulkova were scheduled to be up
first on court seven but the match started five and half hours
late because of the rain.


In her last outing before Miami, Shvedova had lost the first set
to Canada's Stephanie Dubois 6-1 when the Russian retired.


The 1.78 metres tall Moscow-born Shvedova earned her way into the
Miami tournament by winning three straight matches in the
qualifying round.


In other early first round matches on Thursday, Taiwan's Chan
Yung-jan defeated Nuria Llaagostera Vives, of Spain 6-2, 6-3 and
Kaia Kanepi, of Estonia, beat Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4,
6-4.


On the men's side of the draw, Austria's Florian Mayer defeated
Igor Kunitsyn, of Russia, 6-1, 6-0 and Italy's Potito Starace
beat Russia Alex Kuznetsov 6-4, 7-6 (7/4)
