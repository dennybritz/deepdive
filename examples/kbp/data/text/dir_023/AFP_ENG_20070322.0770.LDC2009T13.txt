The death toll from a gas explosion in an illegal coal mine in
northern China has risen to 20 with the discovery of another
body, state press reported.


The updated toll leaves just one more miner unaccounted for in
the disaster in Shanxi province, in which rescue efforts were
hampered by the mine owner's attempts to cover it up, Xinhua news
agency reported late on Thursday.


The report said rescue officials were not officially notified of
the disaster until 44 hours after it occurred on Sunday night.


It did not say when the latest body was recovered.


Authorities initially learned of the accident through other
people with knowledge of the mine.


Eleven people have been arrested for their links to the accident,
including Wang Junjun, the owner of the Miaojiang coal mine.


Authorities said the mine had been operating illegally because it
had disobeyed a government order to merge with a nearby colliery,
a move that was intended to improve work safety practices.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
