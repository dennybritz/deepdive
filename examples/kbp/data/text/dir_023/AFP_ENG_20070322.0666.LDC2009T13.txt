Former US astronaut Lisa Nowak on Thursday pleaded not guilty to
attempting to kidnap a love rival she had allegedly confronted
after driving hundreds of kilometers (miles) wearing a diaper.


Nowak's lawyer entered the plea in writing, and the former
astronaut was not present at the arraignment in Orlando, Florida.


A mother of three who has flown aboard Space Shuttle Discovery,
Nowak, 43, was arrested on February 5. Police said there was
"probable cause" to believe she had intended to murder her
alleged romantic rival.


But she was charged with attempted kidnapping rather than
attempted murder.


Police said she drove more than 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) from
Houston, Texas, to Orlando to attack Colleen Shipman, wearing a
diaper so she would not have to take bathroom breaks.


Nowak allegedly thought Shipman, a US Air Force captain, shared
her romantic interest in 41-year-old shuttle pilot Bill Oefelein.


Nowak wore a wig and trench coat when she approached Shipman's
car at the Orlando International Airport and then doused her with
pepper spray, according to police.


Police found a steel mallet, a serrated knife and a loaded pellet
gun in Shipman's car.


Nowak was released on a 25,500-dollar bond two days after her
arrest.


The case has captivated the media in the United States, earning
headlines such as "Astronaughty," "Space Oddity" "Lust in Space"
and "Astronut."


She was fired by NASA earlier this month.


A US Navy officer since 1987, Nowak flew as mission specialist on
the shuttle Discovery's July 4-17 mission to the International
Space Station.
