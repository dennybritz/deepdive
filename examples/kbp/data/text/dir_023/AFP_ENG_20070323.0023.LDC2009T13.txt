The US military announced Friday the death of another soldier in
Baghdad, where American troops are battling to win back control
of the war-torn Iraqi capital.


The soldier was killed on Thursday when a roadside bomb exploded
alongside a military patrol in the west of Baghdad.


The latest death brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 20 invasion just over four years ago to 3,226,
according to an AFP tally based on Pentagon figures.
