At least three people were killed Friday in a fiery multi-vehicle
crash in a Melbourne tunnel that led to an explosion and forced
hundreds of motorists to evacuate, rescue services said.


Three trucks and four cars were involved in the pile-up in the
Burnley Tunnel, which took place shortly after 10:00 am (2300 GMT
Thursday), Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade spokesman David
Mann said.


"At this stage there are three deceased," Mann said.


"The firefighters are in the tunnel. There's a diesel leak from
one of the trucks but the fire is extinguished."


Hundreds of motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles and
leave the 3.5-kilometre (two-mile) tunnel on foot after the
accident, which sent plumes of thick black smoke spiralling up
through ventilation shafts.


One man said he was driving through the tunnel when he saw a huge
fireball.


"I was eastbound and I overtook a truck which was slowing down
and the next thing, there was a big explosion behind me," the
driver, who identified himself as Peter, told ABC radio.


"I looked in the mirror and I could just see a fireball in the
tunnel and I just floored it and came straight out.


"The explosion was big enough to shake my car and made me look in
the mirror and gave me a real fright."
