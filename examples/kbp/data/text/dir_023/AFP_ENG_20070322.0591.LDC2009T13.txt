Grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park have been taken
off the threatened species list, US officials said Thursday.


A statement on the US Fish and Wildlife Service website said
there were now more than 500 grizzlies in the park, which
straddles the northwestern states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana,
compared with a figure believed to range between 136 and 312 when
they were declared threatened in 1975.


"The grizzly's remarkable comeback is the result of years of
intensive cooperative recovery efforts between federal and state
agencies, conservation groups, and individuals," Deputy Interior
Secretary Lynn Scarlett said.


"The grizzly is a large predator that requires a great deal of
space, and conserving such animals is a challenge in today's
world."


The US Fish and Wildlife Service said grizzly bears in
Yellowstone would now be removed from the "threatened" species
list.


However, four other grizzly populations in the lower 48
contiguous US states have not recovered and would continue to be
protected as threatened species.


The statement said since the 1990s the Yellowstone grizzly
population has grown at a rate of four to seven percent per year.
The Interior Department had first proposed plans to delist the
bears two years ago.
