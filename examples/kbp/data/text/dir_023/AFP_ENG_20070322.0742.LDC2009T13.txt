Hong Kong share prices opened slightly lower Friday on profit-
taking following recent gains sparked by strong 2006 earnings
reports from blue-chip firms, dealers said.


The index has gained more than 700 points over the last four days
in the run-up to the announcement of results by major companies
including China Mobile, Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa.


The Hang Seng Index was down 25.20 points or 0.13 percent at
19,665.05.
