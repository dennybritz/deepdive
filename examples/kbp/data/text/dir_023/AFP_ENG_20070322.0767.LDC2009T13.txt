Japanese share prices rose 0.20 percent in morning trade on
Friday as a weaker yen gave a lift to exporters following a mixed
session overnight on Wall Street, dealers said.


They said buying interest was subdued as investors squared
positions ahead of the weekend and amid lingering uncertainties
about the health of the US economy and stock markets.

ended up 1.49 percent at a three-week high.


"Recent short-covering, which was prompted by a decline in
selling by global funds to hedge against downside risks, has run
out of steam, leaving the market without much buying interest,"
said an equities official at a Japanese brokerage firm.

percent at 2,470 and Yokohama Rubber eight yen or 1.12 percent
