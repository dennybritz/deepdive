The government of Chad accused Sudanese fighter planes of
bombarding towns in its eastern provinces Thursday resulting in
numerous casualties, according to an official statement.


Two Sudanese planes attacked border towns in Tine and Bahai
regions, causing many casualties and damage to buildings, a
government spokesman said, without giving precise details.


Chad condemned the attack and its consequences for its people and
the  Sudanese refugees housed there, the statement said.


The government reserved the right to use any means to defend its
citizens, it added.


The Chadian government on Thursday asked Sudan's ambassador in
N'Djamena to explain the attack, but he had made no formal reply,
according to a Chadian diplomatic source.


Chad and Sudan accuse each other of supporting rebel movements.


Some 230,000 refugees from Darfur have in the past four years
taken shelter in camps in eastern Chad, which has seen renewed
rebel insurgency and ethnic strife since late October 2006.


The United Nations estimates that some 200,000 people have died
in the Darfur fighting and 2.5 million have been displaced since
2003.
