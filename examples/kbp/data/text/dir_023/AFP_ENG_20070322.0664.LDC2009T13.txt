Brazilian police on Thursday said they arrested 11 members of a
drug ring that allegedly shipped Colombian cocaine to the United
States and Europe through Uruguay.


The drug ring shipped between one-half tonne and one tonne of
cocaine each month from Colombia's Norte del Valle drug cartel
through Montevideo, police inspector Victor Cesar Carvalho dos
Santos told reporters.


"To give you an idea, in one week they laundered almost 20
million dollars," Carvahlo said.


Some 250 police officers were deployed Thursday in four Brazilian
states, some bordering on Bolivia and Uruguay, to make the
arrests.


Police arrested the suspects in Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and Sao
Paulo, and were still looking for 40 others, Carvalho said.


The drug ring was headed in Brazil by Alexander Pareja Garcia, a
Colombian known as "Alex," who was arrested September 21 in Sao
Paulo on an extradition request from Uruguay.


Pareja's brother-in-law, Henry Alejandro Rodrigues Galego -- now
in a Spanish jail awaiting extradition to Uruguay -- was
allegedly responsible for distributing the drugs in Europe.


Police also took over 42 buildings the gang had in Rio de
Janeiro, as well as 32 bank accounts used to launder drug money.
In Miami the gang had 30 apartments, Carvalho said.


Police said they shared evidence with counterparts in Uruguay,
Britain, Colombia, Spain and the United States.
