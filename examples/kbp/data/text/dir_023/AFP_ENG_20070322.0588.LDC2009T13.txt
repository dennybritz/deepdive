French nuclear group Areva on Thursday reported a 38.1-percent
fall in net earnings last year to 649 million euros (866 million
dollars) linked to delays at its Olkiluoto reactor project in
Finland.


At the operating level profit declined 43.9 percent to 407
million euros, "essentially because of delays at the reactor
project in Finland," the company said.


But the group said it foresaw a sharp gain in sales and operating
results in 2007.
