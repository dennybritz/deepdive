Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels shot dead seven villagers of the
majority Sinhalese community in northern Sri Lanka on Thursday,
police said.


Gunmen from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) carried
out the massacre in the Avarantalawa village in the district of
Vavuniya where heavy fighting raged between troops and Tamil
Tigers, police said.


Six women and a man were shot dead by the gunmen who escaped
before constables reached the area, a police official said from
Vavuniya, 260 kilometres (162 miles) north of here.
