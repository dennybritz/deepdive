A two-year-old Nigerian was shot in the head in front of her
mother during an armed robbery in a Johannesburg suburb on
Thursday, police said.


One of the robbers shot the toddler at close range when she began
crying during the burglary in the early hours in which thousands
of dollars worth of electrical goods were stolen.


"A group of men broke the buglar-barred window of a house and
overpowered people inside," police spokesman Superintendent
Eugene Opperman told AFP.


"Some went into the bedroom where the child and her mother were
asleep. They woke the mother and ordered her to give them money
and cellphones. The noise woke the kid up and she was shot once
in the head as she started crying."


Opperman said the little girl and her parents had been visiting
relatives in the northern suburb of Lyndhurst.


South Africa has one of the highest rates of crime in the world
with around 50 people murdered every day.
