NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has said the
alliance cannot ignore the threat posed by Iran's long-range
missile tests, in an interview with Germany's Bild newspaper
printed on Thursday.


"Iran's efforts to develop nuclear capabilities is a cause of
great concern for the whole of the international community," he
was quoted as saying.


"We cannot ignore the fact that Iran has already tested missiles
with a range of 1,800 kilometres (1,125 miles) that could even
reach Europe. These findings will of course figure in our
discussions about missile defence."


US plans to locate parts of an anti-missile defence shield in
eastern Europe have triggered a row between Washington and Moscow
that has threatened to embroil the European Union.


Russia regards it as an act of intimidation, but the United
States insists it wants to put a radar system in the Czech
Republic and missiles in Poland, both NATO members, only to ward
off missiles from "rogue" nations like Iran.


EU foreign ministers have said they will await NATO talks with
Russia on April 19, at which a US delegation is to ask for
Russian cooperation, before formally discussing US plans for the
anti-missile shield.
