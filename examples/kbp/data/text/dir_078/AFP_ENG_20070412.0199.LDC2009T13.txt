The Singapore prime minister's decision to donate a pay increase
which boosted his annual income to more than two million US
dollars was not made under pressure, a cabinet minister insisted
Thursday.


Analysts said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's decision to freeze
his salary for five years was an attempt to appease rare public
fury after the government on Monday announced plans to boost
salaries of ministers and civil servants.


Lee, who earned 1.62 million dollars last year, said he would
donate his salary increase to "suitable good causes."


He made the decision "quite some time ago", Vivian Balakrishnan,
Singapore's Second Minister for Information, Communications and
the Arts, told reporters.


"This was not a decision made under pressure," the minister said.


Lee's press secretary, Chen Hwai Liang, earlier told AFP the
decision was not a response to opposition to the salary hike.


"The fact is it was a decision taken up front even before the
announcements of pay revision," Chen said.


The pay increases provoked an outcry from the normally reserved
people of Singapore, where the government has acknowledged a
widening income gap.


By Thursday, more than 1,800 had signed an online petition
against the pay rises.


Cabinet ministers' salaries are to be raised incrementally from
1.2 million dollars to 1.9 million dollars annually by the end of
2008.


Asked whether he would follow Lee's lead and make a donation,
Balakrishnan said, "Generosity should be a private matter."


He added: "At this point now, let's stop talking about money.
Let's get on with the work that needs to be done and to make sure
we do good by Singaporeans."
