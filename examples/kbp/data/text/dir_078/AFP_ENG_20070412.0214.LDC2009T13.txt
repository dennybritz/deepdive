A Garuda Indonesia airliner landed safely Thursday despite a
burst tyre, a spokesman said about a month after one of the flag-
carrier's jets crash-landed in Java, killing 21 people.


The pilot of the Boeing in Thursday's incident noticed the
aircraft shake unusually when it took off from the capital,
Jakarta, but the plane's other indicators seemed normal, Garuda
spokesman Pujobroto said.


The pilot asked ground staff to survey the plane before it landed
on Sulawesi island, and they detected a problem, Pujobroto said.


"It turns out that there was a problem with the left main wheel
-- the inner tyre had burst," he said.


But the plane landed safely and none of the 134 passengers
onboard was hurt, the spokesman said.


March's Garuda crash once again threw the spotlight on
Indonesia's blighted transport safety record. Hundreds of people
have been killed in ferry and airliner accidents over recent
months.


An Adam Air plane plunged into the sea off Sulawesi on New Year's
Day, killing all 102 people onboard.


The government says it is trying to improve passenger protection
in the archipelago nation of 17,000 islands, which depends on air
and sea links.


The accidents have been blamed on old planes and ships, poor
maintenance and insufficient investment in infrastructure despite
booming passenger numbers.
