A Japanese couple who started a profitable business by posting
footage of their sexual acts online were arrested Thursday for
public indecency, police said.


While pornography is widely available in Japan, police acted in
the unusual case as they argued that the Internet amounted to
public exposure.


Police arrested Fumio Hisano, 38, and his 32-year-old wife,
Reiko, in central Fukui prefecture, a local police official said.


"The suspects have admitted most of the allegations," the
official said.


The couple started the website, dubbed "Aya's Room," after a
common Japanese woman's name, some five or six years ago.


The couple collected more than 200 million yen (1.7 million
dollars) from viewers who paid to watch the couple's sexual acts,
police said.
