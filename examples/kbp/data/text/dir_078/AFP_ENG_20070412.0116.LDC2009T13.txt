Henrik Sedin scored with 1:54 remaining in the fourth overtime
and Roberto Luongo made 72 saves as the Vancouver Canucks began
their playoffs against the Dallas Stars with an epic 5-4 win.


Daniel Sedin and captain Markus Naslund each had a goal and an
assist for Vancouver, which hosts game two on Friday.


Making his first career postseason appearance on Wednesday,
Luongo was staked to a 4-2 lead before allowing goals by Antti
Miettinen and Ladislav Nagy just over five minutes apart midway
through the third period.


But the All-Star closed the door the rest of the way, turning
aside the final four shots he faced in the session and all 36
directed his way over 78 minutes, six seconds of overtime.


With the game just 70 seconds away from being the fifth-longest
overtime contest in playoff history, the Sedin twins teamed to
give Vancouver a hard-earned win.


From along the left wing boards, defenseman Mattias Ohlund sent
the puck behind the net to Daniel Sedin, who passed it in front.


Getting in front of a defender, Henrik Sedin whacked it past
goaltender Marty Turco for his ninth career postseason tally and
a 5-4 triumph.
