Two Africans are to appear in court next Tuesday charged over
Singapore's biggest drug bust in six years, anti-narcotics
officers said Thursday.


A Ghanaian man, Chijioke Stephen Obioha, 28, is charged with
trafficking 14 kilograms (31 pounds) of cannabis. A Zambian
woman, Daka Guinea, 20, is charged with providing him with the
drugs, according to court documents obtained by AFP.


If convicted, both will face the death penalty which is mandatory
for anyone guilty of trafficking more than 500 grams of cannabis,
15 grams of heroin, or 30 grams of cocaine.


The Central Narcotics Bureau did not release the names of the
suspects but said officers arrested a trafficker from Ghana and a
Zambian courier on Monday when they seized cannabis with a street
value of 410,000 dollars (271,523 US).


A bureau official told AFP the drug haul was the largest since
2001 when 35 kilograms of heroin were seized. She added it was
also the biggest amount of cannabis seized in a decade.


The Narcotics Bureau said the trafficker used a taxi to transport
the cannabis in 14 slabs from a budget hotel to another part of
town where he had a "hideout- cum-drugstore."


In January Singapore executed a Nigerian and another African man
for smuggling heroin. Their deaths came despite protests from
Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo, the United Nations and
human rights activists.
