President Pervez Musharraf said Thursday that Pakistani tribesmen
had killed around 300 foreign militants near the Afghan border
and that the army had helped the tribal fighters.


"The people of South Waziristan now have risen against the
foreigners. They have killed about 300 of them," military ruler
Musharraf told a conference of defence officials from 22
countries.


"They have support from the Pakistan army. They asked for it."
