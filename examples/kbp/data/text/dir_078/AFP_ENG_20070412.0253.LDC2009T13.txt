Syria has withdrawn from a Fed Cup women's tennis tournament in
New Zealand following a terrorist threat, tournament organisers
said Thursday.


An unspecified threat aimed at the Syrian team was made to the
International Tennis Federation (ITF) in London last month.


Police in the tournament venue of Christchurch last week
confirmed a threat by unidentified sources, but said they were
confident the Asia/Oceania Group 1 tournament would be safe.


Earlier, Sri Lanka withdrew from the event, reducing the number
of countries taking part to 10.


Tournament director David Blackwell said the withdrawals were
"obviously disappointing."


"The organisers respect the independent decisions made by these
countries," he said.


The ITF said organisers had worked closely with New Zealand
police in the security planning for the tournament and were
confident of player and public safety.


The tournament format was amended following the withdrawals, with
the start brought forward two days to April 16.


Teams will play round-robin matches in two pools of five with the
top two teams meeting in the final on April 21.


The 10 nations taking part are Taipei, South Korea, Uzbekistan,
Kazakhstan, Singapore, Jordan, New Zealand, India, Thailand and
Hong Kong.
