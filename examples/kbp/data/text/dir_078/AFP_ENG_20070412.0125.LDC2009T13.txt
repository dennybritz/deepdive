The BBC director general appealed on Thursday for the release of
journalist Alan Johnston who was abducted in the Gaza Strip
exactly one month ago.


"I appeal to all those who may have influence with the kidnappers
to use their best endeavours to secure Alan's release safely and
speedily," Mark Thompson told a press conference in Ramallah.


Thompson said the British broadcaster was "increasingly concerned
about the physical and mental toll his incarceration are taking
on him."


Johnston, a Scotsman who has been the BBC's main correspondent in
Gaza for three years, was forced from his car at gunpoint as he
drove home from work on March 12 in Gaza City.
