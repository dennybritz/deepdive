An explosion inside the Iraqi parliament building canteen on
Thursday killed at least two people and wounded another 15
people, a security official said.


The explosion ripped through the canteen towards the end of lunch
when some lawmakers were finishing their meals and others were
speaking to journalists, the official said.


The identities of the casualties were not immediately clear nor
was the cause of the blast, which caused serious damage to the
cafeteria hall.
