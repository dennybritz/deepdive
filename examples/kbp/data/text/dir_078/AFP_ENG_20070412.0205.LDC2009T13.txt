Poland leapfrogged Russia last year to become the top foreign
investor in neighbouring Lithuania, official data showed
Thursday.


Polish investment totaled 6.5 billion litas (1.88 billion euros,
2.53 billion dollars) in 2006, accounting for 22.6 percent of all
foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Baltic state, the
Lithuanian statistics bureau said.


Total direct foreign investment in Lithuania last year grew by
20.4 percent to 28.8 billion litas.


Poland's jump up the investment ranking was largely tied to the
Polish oil group PKN Orlen's takeover of Lithuania's Mazeikiu
Nafta refinery complex.


PKN Orlen acquired a majority stake in Mazeikiu last year from
bankrupt Russian oil group Yukos and the Lithuanian government
for 2.34 billion dollars in two separate transactions on the
Vilnius stock exchange.
