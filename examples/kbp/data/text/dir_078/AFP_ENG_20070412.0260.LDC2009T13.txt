At least six top officials in a large central China city are
facing massive graft charges, while a top prosecutor was
dismissed for illicit sexual relations, a government report said
Thursday.


The top Communist Party official of Chenzhou city, Li Dalun, is
facing charges of taking more than 14 million yuan (1.8 million
dollars) in bribes, the Hunan provincial government said in a
report.


Li also possessed 17.6 million yuan in assets that he could not
account for, it said.


Li served for seven years as the top official in Chenzhou, a city
of 4.6 million people, and "sought personal profit" as he
approved development projects and promoted officials, the report
by the provincial prosecutor's office said.


Others implicated in the scandal include Chenzhou vice party head
Zeng Jinchun, accused of accepting 30 million yuan in bribes and
possessing 50 million yuan in assets that he could not account
for, it said.


Zeng was in charge of the city's mining resources.


At least four other top officials were also implicated, including
the city's two top land administrators and top propaganda
official, all Communist Party members, it said.


In a related issue, the vice head of Hunan's Communist Party
disciplinary committee, Du Xiangcheng, was kicked out of the
party for frequenting a prostitute, the report added.


Police busted down a door of a five-star hotel in Beijing in
December last year to find Du with a Russian prostitute, the
report said.
