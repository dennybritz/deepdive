China has published a handbook for its citizens on what to do in
the event of a terrorist attack and warned them they are not
immune from the global scourge, state media said Thursday.


The "attractive, snappily illustrated paperback" will be
available to the public at a cost of 20 yuan (2.50 dollars) and
cover a broad range of issues associated with terrorism," Xinhua
news agency said.


"Terrorism is an international reality and a threat to people's
safety everywhere, including China," Du Xiangwan, vice president
of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, which produced the book,
was quoted as saying.


"By making the public more aware of terrorism, and providing them
with scientific information, we can improve their capacity to
respond," Du said.


The dispatch did not mention the 2008 Beijing Olympics but
Chinese officials have said terrorism is a key security focus
ahead of the Games.


Chinese authorities have said more than 100,000 police and other
security professionals will be on hand to provide security during
the Games, aided by more than 600,000 volunteer Beijing
residents.


China has largely been spared from terrorist attacks that have
plagued other nations in recent years.


However Beijing claims it faces a terrorist threat from members
of China's minority Uighur population, who continue to harbour
independence ambitions for their homeland in China's far
northwest Xinjiang region.
