Surgeons in Taiwan have reattached the left forearm of a vet
after it was bitten off by a sick crocodile he was tending in a
zoo, they said Thursday,


Chang Po-yu, 38, was said to be in a stable condition in hospital
after six hours of surgery, and doctors said he had an 80 percent
chance of keeping the limb as some functions had returned to
normal.


He was injecting the crocodile with anaesthetic in the zoo in the
southern city of Kaohsiung on Wednesday when it turned on him,
tearing off the forearm and holding it in its mouth.


The animal only let go when a police officer fired two bullets
into it, zoo officials said, in dramatic scenes caught on
television.


Chang was rushed to hospital where the limb, recovered from the
crocodile, was delivered some 80 minutes later to the operating
theatre.


Meanwhile, the crocodile has survived the shooting and is now
drawing lots of visitors to its enclosure, officials said, some
even reportedly crossing a police line to catch a closer glimpse.
