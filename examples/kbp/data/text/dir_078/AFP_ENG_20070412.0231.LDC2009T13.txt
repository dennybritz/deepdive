Japan's Sony Corp. said Thursday that it hopes to launch the
world's first organic electroluminescence flat-screen television
later this year, aiming to take an early lead over its rivals.


Such screens, which sandwich a very thin layer of organic
material between two plates, use less power and offer brighter
images and wider viewing angles than liquid crystal display
panels.


"We are going to mass produce and start selling eleven-inch
organic electroluminescence (television) models by the end of the
year, which will be a world first," said Sony spokesman Chisato
Kitsukawa.


Rival Canon has previously said it is also considering a
commercial launch of electroluminescence display panels by 2007.


Competition in flat-panel displays is heating up, with
electronics manufacturers vying over several different types.


Sharp Corp. is concentrating on liquid crystal displays, while
Matsushita Electric Industrial, best known for its Panasonic
brand, has been heavily investing in plasma display panels.


Sony was initially left trailing by its rivals in the fast-
growing flat- television market, but has since made a strong
comeback.
