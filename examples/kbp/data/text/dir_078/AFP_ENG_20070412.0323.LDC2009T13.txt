The condition of former Croatian prime minister Ivica Racan, who
is fighting cancer, worsened sharply Thursday, his party said.


"The condition of Ivica Racan has rapidly deteriorated this
morning," a statement from the main opposition Social-Democratic
party said.


On Wednesday Racan resigned as party leader.


President Stipe Mesic, who visited him earlier Thursday,
confirmed his condition was grave.


"His condition is very serious, but he regained conciousness when
his wife said 'Do you recognize your friend?'" said visibly
shaken Mesic.


He added that they exchanged a few words before Racan lost
consciousness again.


Racan, 63, has been hospitalised in Zagreb since March 24 after
cancer spread to his brain, a month after undergoing surgery to
remove a tumorous kidney.


Racan was Croatia's prime minister between 2000 and late 2003.


His government is credited with significantly improving the
country's post-war image and ending its international isolation
after years of autocratic rule by the late nationalist president
Franjo Tudjman, who died in 1999.


His party has yet to elect a successor to him ahead of general
polls later this year.
