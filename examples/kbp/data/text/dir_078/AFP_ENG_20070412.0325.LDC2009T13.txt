Ireland's skipper Brian O'Driscoll was named on Thursday as the
Six Nations Player of the Championship for the second straight
year.


The star centre came out top in a vote by fans logging on to the
official Championship website www.rbs6nations.com and selecting
their dream team.


O'Driscoll was again the clear winner this year, collecting more
than twice the amount of votes than his closest competitor.


He adds the award to his impressive haul of trophies recently
following Ireland's successful defence of the Triple Crown,
defeating England, Scotland and Wales.


This year's Six Nations was one of the most hotly contested for
years, with France narrowly edging out Ireland to win the
Championship thanks to a last- minute try in Dublin..


"There were some outstanding players and performances in this
years Six Nations Championship, so I was very surprised to learn
that I had been voted as player of the tournament," O'Driscoll
said.
