Norway, the only Western country to normalise ties with the new
Palestinian government, is ready to resume direct aid to the
Palestinian Authority, Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on
Thursday.


The aid would resume once the final technical details are
resolved.


"Once the minister says the situation is cleared we will be ready
to resume direct budget support to the Palestinian Authority,"
Stoere said following talks with Palestinian Finance Minister
Salam Fayaad in Oslo.
