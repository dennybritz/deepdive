Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych signalled Thursday
that he is ready to take part in early elections, as demanded by
his political rival President Viktor Yushchenko.


In a major compromise, Yanukovych said he could take part in an
election even if the constitutional court, which is due to start
hearings next week, rules that Yushchenko's demand is
illegitimate.


"If the court rules the decree was unconstitutional, elections
are possible if all the participants in the political process
agree," he told journalists.
