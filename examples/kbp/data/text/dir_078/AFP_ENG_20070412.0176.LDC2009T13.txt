Global crude prices climbed higher on Thursday as traders weighed
up a heavy fall in US gasoline stockpiles, dealers said.


The price of Brent North Sea crude for May delivery added 25
cents to 68.09 dollars per barrel in London electronic trading.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, gained 39 cents to 62.40 dollars per barrel in
electronic deals before the official open of the US market.


Crude futures had swung higher on Wednesday after the US
Department of Energy said that gasoline, or petrol, reserves
slumped last week by much more than expected, ahead of the peak
demand season for motor fuel.


Inventories of US gasoline plunged by 5.5 million barrels to
199.7 million in the week to April 6. Analysts had forecast a
lighter drop of 1.4 million barrels.


Gasoline stockpiles are a crucial focus for the market ahead of
the so-called US driving season that starts next month and sees
many Americans take to their cars for their holidays.
