The chief executive of French luxury goods empire PPR, Francois-
Henri Pinault, was in Nuremberg on Thursday to present his plans
for the takeover of German sportsgear maker Puma.


At a joint press conference with Pinault, Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz,
weclomed "our new shareholders PPR" and insisted that the tie-up
between the German "sports lifestyle" brand and PRR's luxury
brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent would not lead to any
"cannibalisation."


Cannibalisation is the term used when one part of a company grows
by taking sales from another.


In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, PPR announced it had
agreed to buy a 27-percent stake in Puma and launch a full public
takeover offer for the rest in in a bid that valued the German
company at a total 5.3 billion euros (7.1 billion dollars).


However, at their annual meeting on Wednesday, Puma shareholders
expressed scepticism at the bid, judging the price tag of 330
euros per share too low.


Puma shares have risen more than 10 percent since PPR unveiled
its offer, rising as high as 350 euros on Wednesday.


While Puma CEO Zeitz insisted that the price was "fair" and
recommended shareholders take up the offer, he also did not
exclude a possible higher bid from PPR.


But PPR has said it had no plans to raise its bid.
