President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov of Turkmenistan will travel
to Saudi Arabia this week in what will be his first foreign visit
since being elected in February, an official said on Thursday.


Berdymukhammedov will spend three days in the kingdom where he
will meet King Abdullah for talks on "cooperation and energy",
the official, who requested anonymity, told AFP.


Two agreements on energy and "the humanitarian sphere" could also
be signed during the visit which is due to last from April 13
until April 16.


Berdymukhammedov, who was elected earlier this month with almost
90 percent of the votes cast, took over as interim leader
following the death of Saparmurat Niyazov last December after 21
years of dictatorial rule.


The Turkmen leader will also visit Saudi Arabia's key religious
sites of Medina and Mecca, the government official said.
