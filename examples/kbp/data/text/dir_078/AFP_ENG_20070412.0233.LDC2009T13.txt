Taiwan said Thursday it is planning to launch a new bid to join
the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a member under the name
"Taiwan" in a move likely to anger rival China.


"In the past we made efforts to become an observer of the World
Health Assembly (WHA) and fought for the right to attend
technical conferences. This year we will also apply for WHO
membership," said presidential secretary general Chiou I-jen.


The WHA is the highest decision-making body of the WHO, whose 192
member countries meet once a year to agree on policies and
appoint a director-general.


Since 1997, Taipei's annual attempts to become an observer at the
WHA as a "health entity" have been thwarted by Beijing, which
considers the island part of its territory awaiting
reunification.


"Our previous efforts have failed due to China's suppression. Our
government decided to apply this year for both an observer seat
on the WHA and membership with the WHO using the name 'Taiwan',"
Chiou said.


President Chen Shui-bian made the requests in a letter sent
Wednesday to WHO director general Margaret Chan via Taipei's
representative office in Geneva, officials here said.


Taiwan was evicted from the WHO in 1972, a year after losing the
"China" seat in the United Nations to Beijing.


Names and titles are highly symbolic issues in the row between
Taiwan and China, which split after the end of a civil war in
1949.


Only 24 countries maintain diplomatic relations with Taipei over
Beijing.
