Rival Sunni and Shiite Muslims in mountainous northwest Pakistan
clashed again Thursday after a week of fighting that has left at
least 55 people dead, officials and residents said.


Fierce gunbattles continued in two villages near the curfew-bound
tribal town of Parachinar after the deaths of 15 people on
Wednesday, security officials told AFP on condition of anonymity.


A jirga, or tribal council, was making contact with both groups
in the troubled area, part of the semi-autonomous Kurram region
bordering Afghanistan, in a bid to restore peace, the officials
said.


They said the toll from the past week was now at least 55.


Residents said at least 40 houses were torched in Jalime and Char
Dewar villages, on the outskirts of Parachinar, on Wednesday.
Women and children fled to the nearby town of Alizai, they said.


The fighting erupted on April 5 after members of the Shiite
community protested outside their mosque against local Sunnis,
who allegedly chanted anti-Shiite slogans during a religious
rally early this month.


Shiites account for about 20 per cent of Pakistan's 160 million
Sunni-dominated population but are in the majority in Parachinar.


Parachinar, which has a population of about 70,000 people, has
remained under curfew since then and soldiers patrolling the town
have been given shoot-on- sight orders to curb the violence.


A two-day lull in the violence was shattered on Wednesday.


Sectarian violence involving Sunni and Shiite militants has
claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late 1980s.
