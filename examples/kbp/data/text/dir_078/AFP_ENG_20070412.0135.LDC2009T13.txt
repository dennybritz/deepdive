At least 35 Taliban militants were killed in a battle with Afghan
and US-led troops in restive southern Afghanistan, a provincial
governor's spokesman said Thursday.


The fighting erupted Wednesday after dozens of Taliban fighters
attacked Afghan security forces in the southern province of
Zabul, spokesman Gulab Shah Alikhil told AFP.


The rebels were killed after US-led coalition forces responded
with ground troops and warplanes after a call from their Afghan
counterparts who came under attack in the province's Shahjoy
district, Alikhil said.


"Initially our troops came under attack. They called for support
from the coalition troops who responded with ground troops and
air support. Thirty-five Taliban were killed in the subsequent
fighting," he said.


The US-led coalition headquarters said it had no immediate
information.
