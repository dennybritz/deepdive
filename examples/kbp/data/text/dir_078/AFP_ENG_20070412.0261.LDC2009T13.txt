The death toll from Wednesday's suicide bombings in Algiers has
risen to 33, Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Zerhouni said
Thursday.


The figure was higher than that provided by the civil defence
agency, which said the car bomb attacks had killed 24 and injured
222 people.


Zerhouni, who visited some of the wounded in hospital, said all
but 57 had been allowed home after treatment for their injuries.
