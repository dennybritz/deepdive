Foreign direct investment into China in the first quarter of the
year totalled 15.9 billion dollars, a rise of 11.6 percent from
the same period a year earlier, the government said Thursday.


Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands -- where many Chinese
companies register for tax purposes -- and Japan were the top
three sources of foreign direct investment, the commerce ministry
said.


Last year actual foreign investment in China was 69.5 billion
dollars, down 4.1 percent from 2005.


If the financial sector were to be excluded, the figure totalled
63 billion dollars, a rise of 4.5 percent.


Japan has traditionally been among the top investors in China,
despite protracted political differences between the two Asian
giants.


But a political thaw, highlighted in a Tokyo visit by Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao this week, could help further promote
investment by Japanese enterprises, according to observers.


"We do see some further development in the positive direction of
Sino-Japan relations," said Tai Hui, Hong Kong-based chief China
economist with Standard Chartered.


"I think it would be a positive to further investment by Japanese
companies into mainland China, but obviously some of these
differences are very deep-rooted, it's due to take more than just
a couple of trips to eliminate."
