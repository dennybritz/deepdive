Four Bosnian emergency workers who failed to revive a heart
attack victim ended up in hospital after being assaulted by the
dead man's relatives, an official said Thursday.


Relatives of Nazif Prutina who had a fatal heart attack at his
Sarajevo home on Wednesday turned on the ambulance team in
protest over their slow arrival at the scene, the director of the
emergency service Alija Mulaomerovic told AFP.


As two doctors attempted to resuscitate the patient, six members
of his family shouted insults at them and then assaulted
assisting medical technicians.


Three members of the team were hospitalized with injuries,
including a broken nose fracture and serious facial bruises.


A fourth was discharged after his bruised shoulder and hands had
been treated.


"The first team arrived at location some 15 minutes after we
received the call, another team had also been sent and they
arrived six minutes latter," Mulaomerovic said.


"People are frustrated and unhappy with many things so they vent
their anger on us, but we have never been beaten before," he
added.


Mulaomerovic explained that Sarajevo's emergency service has six
teams working in a shift of which two are mobile.


On a normal day emergency rooms and ambulance teams assist some
500 patients.
