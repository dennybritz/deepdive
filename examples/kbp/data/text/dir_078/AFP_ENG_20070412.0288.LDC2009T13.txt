The European Central Bank held its key interest rates steady as
expected at its regular monthly policy-setting meeting here on
Thursday, just a month after raising them to their highest level
in five and a half years.


The ECB said it held the minimum bid rate for its regular
refinancing operations steady at 3.75 percent after raising it by
a quarter of a percentage point in March.


It also held its two other key rates -- the deposit rate and the
marginal lending rate -- unchanged at 2.75 percent and 4.75
percent respectively.
