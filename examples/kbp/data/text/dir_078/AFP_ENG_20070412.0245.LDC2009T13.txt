Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has lifted a ban on the export
of raw materials into Zambia following high-level talks between
the two countries, Zambian state radio said Thursday.


The DRC government has since opened its three border posts with
Zambia which were temporarily closed to traffic in order to stop
the export of copper concentrates, state-run Zambia National
Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) said.


Jennifer Musonda, permanent secretary of Zambia's Copperbelt
province, was quoted as saying the situation had been normalised
following a successful meeting of the Zambia-Congo joint
permanent commission.


The DRC had in March put an embargo on trading raw minerals with
neighbouring Zambia in an effort to stop alleged smuggling and
fraud.


Zambia President Levy Mwanawasa intervened in the matter by
sending a special envoy to discuss the issue with his Congolese
counter-part Joseph Kabila after more than 400 trucks were
marooned at the frontier.


Mwanawasa has since sacked his envoy, Vernon Mwaanga, for
"mishandling" a mission to the DRC where he made contradictory
statements, which the president said was a departure from his
instructions.


Mwaanga, a close ally and confidante of Mwanawasa, served as
information minister as well as parliamentary chief whip before
his dismissal on Wednesday.
