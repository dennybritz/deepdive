British music label EMI said Thursday that it had settled a
royalties dispute with Apple Corps, the publishing group founded
by The Beatles, in a move which could pave the way for legal
downloads of the Fab Four's hits.


"I can confirm that we have reached a mutually acceptable
settlement and that we are not going to say anything more than
that," an EMI spokeswoman told AFP.


The music publisher was still working towards putting The
Beatles' songs on Apple Inc.'s iTunes website, she added.


The vast catalogue of Beatles hits, including "Let it Be," "Hey
Jude" and "Come Together," is barred from legal Internet download
sites at the band's insistence, despite protests from EMI, which
owns their recording rights.


Apple Corps -- owned by surviving Beatles Paul McCartney and
Ringo Starr and the widows of bandmates John Lennon and George
Harrison -- had claimed that EMI owed 30 million pounds (44
million euros, 59 million dollars) in missing royalties from
album sales between 1994 and 1999.


The band had begun legal proceedings in London's High Court in
2005 to recover the alleged missing funds.


British newspaper The Daily Telegraph had reported earlier
Thursday that EMI and Apple Corps had agreed to settle the case
at the end of March -- but added that the terms of the settlement
were confidential.
