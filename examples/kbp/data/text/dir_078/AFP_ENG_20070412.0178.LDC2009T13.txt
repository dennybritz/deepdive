Legendary Russian cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich has
been hospitalised in Moscow, state-run news agency RIA Novosti
quoted a source close to his family as saying Thursday.


"The maestro is in hospital in Moscow," the source, who was not
identified, was quoted as saying.


Rostropovich's spokesman was not available for comment.


The musician turned 80 in March. He was hospitalised in February
for a reported operation on a liver tumor and appeared pale and
tired during television footage of his birthday celebrations in
Moscow.


Rostropovich was born in Baku and studied in Moscow under the
celebrated composers Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev. He
went on to a glittering international career, much of it spent
abroad after he was persecuted, then expelled in 1974 by the
Soviet authorities.
