An Iraqi radio journalist and her husband have been killed and
their corpses burnt in the country's third largest city of Mosul,
a media rights organisation said Thursday.


Gunmen shot dead Iman Yussef Abdallah, who worked for the radio
mouthpiece of the Mosul workers' union, and her husband in an
eastern area of the city on Wednesday, the Iraqi Association for
the Defence of Journalists' Rights said.


Their bodies were later set alight in their vehicle, said the
organisation, urging the Iraqi government to take measures to
protect journalists.


A number of journalists have been reported killed in Mosul since
January and last week two journalists died in Baghdad -- a deputy
bureau chief of a television channel killed in a suicide truck
bomb outside the network's office and a woman newsreader who was
kidnapped and whose body was found dumped.


Insurgents have stepped up attacks in and around Mosul and Iraqi
and US forces last week launched a military crackdown in the
city.


More than 150 media workers, 95 percent of them Iraqi, have been
killed in Iraq in the four years since the 2003 US-led invasion.
