China urged India Thursday to promote peace and stability in Asia
after New Delhi tested a nuclear-capable ballistic missile.


"As for the ballistic missile test of India, we have noted the
reports," foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said.


"We hope that India, as a country with an important influence in
this region, can work to maintain and promote peace and stability
in the region.


"We hope they can make a positive contribution in this regard and
play a positive role."


Qin refused to comment further on the test.


India on Thursday test-fired a nuclear-capable intermediate-range
ballistic missile which can reach the Chinese cities of Beijing
and Shanghai.


The launch of the Agni-III missile took place from Wheeler
Island, 180 kilometres (110 miles) northeast of Bhubaneswar,
capital of the eastern state of Orissa.


India, which conducted nuclear weapons tests in 1998, has
developed a series of nuclear and conventional missile systems as
part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation
Integrated Missile Development Programme which was launched in
1983.
