A strike by French air traffic controllers caused flight
cancellations at Paris' Orly airport on Thursday and disruptions
were also expected at Charles de Gaulle international airport.


Hundreds of flights from Orly airport and from Charles de Gaulle
international airport were expected to be cancelled due to the
strike, said Marc Hamy, director of air navigation services at
the civil aviation authority.


"We expect 35 to 50 percent of flights to be cancelled from Orly
today and hope to maintain 400 of the 700 daily flights that are
scheduled," Hamy told AFP.


He said up to 500 out of the 1,500 flights scheduled to fly out
of Charles de Gaulle airport would be grounded and that many
flights would be delayed in the afternoon.


Workers belonging to two unions are protesting at plans to merge
air traffic control operations for the Paris region at one site
separate from the airports.


At Orly, which provides flights to cities within France and to
nearby European destinations, four of the 12 air traffic
controllers usually on duty were on the job to ensure minimal
services.


At Charles de Gaulle airport, all but two of the 30 air traffic
controllers were at their posta early Thursday, said Hamy.
