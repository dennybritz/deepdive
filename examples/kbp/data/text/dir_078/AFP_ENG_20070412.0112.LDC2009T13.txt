Chinese share prices closed at a fresh record high Thursday,
adding 1.02 percent on strong follow-through buying with
machinery and power companies in demand, dealers said.


They said investor sentiment was bolstered by the strengthening
currency, the yuan and continued expectations for strong
corporate earnings as markets registered their ninth straight day
of gains.


But with China's two bourses at record highs analysts warned the
run-up could trigger a correction similar to the one that rocked
markets in February when Chinese shares tumbled 9.0 percent.


The Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and B-shares, closed
up 35.81 points at 3,531.03 on turnover of 148.37 billion yuan
(19.19 billion US dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 37.86 points or 1.03 percent at
3,712.22 on turnover of 147.75 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index was up 21.86 points or 2.25 percent at a record
993.26, on turnover of 83.44 billion yuan.
