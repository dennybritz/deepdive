Swiss authorities said Thursday they were arranging the speedy
return of a Swiss man who was pardoned by Thailand's King
Bhumibol Adulyadej after being jailed for vandalising portraits
of the monarch.


"Thailand has asked for Switzerland's help in the repatriation,"
said Swiss foreign ministry spokesman Jean-Philippe Jeannerat.


"Under the rules of consular protection, we are working to ensure
the return of our citizen as soon as possible, by providing the
necessary assistance," Jeannerat told AFP.


Swiss and Thai sources said the man, Olivier Jufer, was expected
to arrive at Zurich airport early on Friday.


He was released from prison and into the custody of immigration
officials in Thailand on Tuesday and awaiting deportation
following the royal pardon, Thai prison authorities said.


Jufer, 57, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on March 29 after
pleading guilty to five counts of lese majeste -- the crime of
offending the dignity of a sovereign.


He was convicted after security cameras videotaped him defacing
portraits of the king on December 5, which is the monarch's
birthday and a time of national celebration, during a drunken
spree in Chiang Mai.


At the time, the Swiss foreign ministry said it would not be
seeking his release, arguing that he was arrested on the basis of
clearly established laws and tried in a manner that conformed to
basic judicial principles.


Jufer is from Zurich but has lived mainly in Thailand for the
last 10 years, where he married a Thai woman, according to Thai
authorities.
