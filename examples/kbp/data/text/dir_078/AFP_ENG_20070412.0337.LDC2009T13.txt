British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was "deeply
shocked and saddened" to learn of Thursday's deadly explosion
inside the Iraqi parliament building.


"I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear of this appalling
attack on the democratically elected members of the Iraqi
Parliament going about their day-to- day business," Beckett said
in a statement.


"Nothing could highlight more the twisted minds of those who are
seeking to disrupt the democratic process in Iraq," she said.
