Small groups of protesters including Japanese nationalists
rallied Thursday against Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who is on a
visit to Tokyo meant to heal wounded relations.


More than a dozen activists belonging to right-wing and left-wing
groups and the Falungong, a spiritual movement banned in China,
led the noisy protest outside Wen's hotel where they were
outnumbered by police.


"Wen Jiabao, go home!" one protester shouted over a loudspeaker.


"Wen used the word 'peace' in his speech in the parliament this
morning, but don't forget what the Chinese Communist Party has
done so far. They oppressed the human rights of people there,"
the man said.


Another group chanted, "Don't forgive Wen Jiabao and the Chinese
government's massacres and torture of the Tibetans and Uighurs!"


In one of the more unusual statements, one protester held up a
sign reading, "Wen Jiabao, go to Yasukuni shrine!", referring to
the controversial Shinto sanctuary that venerates Japanese war
dead and war criminals alike.


The Yasukuni shrine is one of the thorniest issues between Japan
and China. Beijing was infuriated by former Japanese prime
minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the shrine which China
sees as symbol of Japan's past imperialism.


In a speech to the Japanese parliament Thursday, Wen made no
direct reference to the Yasukuni shrine and called on the two
countries to move beyond bitter memories of the past.
