Hong Kong share prices closed 0.34 percent lower Thursday,
snapping a five-day winning streak as minutes of last month's US
Federal Reserve meeting renewed worries over interest rates,
dealers said.


They said the market's fall was cushioned by another record high
on China's A-share markets, which sparked interest in select
mainland firms listed here.


Fed meeting minutes released overnight indicated that
policymakers remain concerned over inflation, leaving the door
open for interest rate rises.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed down 69.22 points at
20,380.21.
