Russia's atomic chief on Thursday renewed doubts about Iran's
boast that it had entered a new phase of its atomic drive, saying
that enrichment was a difficult process.


Iran's firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced this
week that the Islamic republic's controversial uranium enrichment
work had reached an "industrial stage."


But Russia, which is building Iran's first nuclear power plant,
and other nations have cast doubts on the substance of his
statement.


"Iran is reportedly trying to increase the number of centrifuges.
But would this mean complete enrichment?" asked Sergei Kiriyenko,
head of the Russian Federal Agency for Atomic Energy.


"We don't think so, according to our experts," he told reporters
in Tokyo.


"Simply having numerous centrifuges doesn't mean they can start
the enrichment process," he said. "There are many difficult
issues that need to be resolved."


Enrichment of uranium is the key sticking point in the standoff
between Iran and the West, as the process can produce nuclear
fuel but in highly extended form can also make the fissile core
for an atomic bomb.


Iran says its nuclear drive is solely aimed at generating energy
and that it does not plan to build a military capacity.
