Iran has arrested 90 members of a shadowy Sunni militant group
known as Jundallah accused of attacks in a volatile area on the
border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, a press report said on
Thursday.


"We have arrested 90 members of this group and a large quantity
of weapons and explosives were also confiscated," Intelligence
Minister Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Ejeie was quoted as saying in
Kayhan newspaper.


He said four militants who were "preparing for armed action" were
also arrested.


However, he did not say whether they were among the 90 or reveal
when the arrests took place.


Jundallah has been blamed for a string of attacks in the
southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, which borders
Pakistan and Afghanistan and has a substantial Baluch community,
a minority Sunni Muslim group.


In February, 11 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards were
killed and 31 wounded when a car bomb ripped through a bus
carrying them to a base in an attack claimed by Jundallah.


Mohseni Ejeie said his ministry's agents were also closely
monitoring the activities of militant groups in the southwestern
province of Khuzestan which borders Iraq and is home to a
substantial Arab minority.


"Ten days ago, we arrested a group of seven people who wanted to
carry out several bomb attacks (in Khuzestan)," he added.


In the past two years, Khuzestan has been rocked by a string of
blasts blamed on Arab separatist groups which Iran charges are
backed by Britain.
