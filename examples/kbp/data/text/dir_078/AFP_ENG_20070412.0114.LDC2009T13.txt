Israeli researchers are looking into whether venom from spiders,
including the deadly black widow, could help cure impotency, the
Yediot Aharonot reported on Thursday.


The research was launched after observations that some men bitten
by spiders "suffered from prolonged erections," the mass-selling
daily said.


"This is the first research of its kind and could help a great
number of men," the paper said.


Among the spiders beings studied are the black widow, the female
spider who is known for sometimes eating her mate after
copulation, as well as two other arachnids that can be found in
Africa and South America, it said.


The research is being carried out by the urology department at
Rambam Hospital in the northern city of Haifa.
