Sony Corp's games unit will stop selling the PlayStation 3 with a
20-gigabyte hard drive in North America due to insufficient
demand, a spokeswoman said Thursday.


"When we started selling the PS3 it ended up that a lot of people
wanted the 60-gigabyte (version) even though it was more
expensive," said Sony Computer Entertainment spokeswoman Nanako
Kato.


Sony Computer Entertainment North America therefore decided to
stop selling the 20GB version, she added.


The 20GB version is priced at about 500 dollars in the United
States while the 60GB model -- which also offers storage media
slots and built-in Wi-Fi for wireless Internet access -- has a
price tag of around 600 dollars.


Sony opted not to offer the smaller hard drive version in Europe
where the PS3 launched last month, so the 20GB model will be
available only in Japan and some Asian countries, Kato said.


The electronics giant released the PlayStation last year
initially only in key North American and Asian markets after a
delay of about six months due to a glitch with the high-
definition DVD player.
