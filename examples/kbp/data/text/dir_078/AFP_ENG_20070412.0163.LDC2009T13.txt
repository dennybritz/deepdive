Nina Wang, the famously frugal Hong Kong tycoon who died last
week, is to get a no-expense-spared send-off, a report said
Thursday.


Wang's family is spending millions of dollars on flowers for the
funeral of the late head of the Chinechem property business.


They have hired James Wong, a local florist who has supplied
flowers for the funerals of some of the city's best-known
celebrities including popular actor and singer Leslie Cheung, the
Apple Daily newspaper said.


Wong said Wang's funeral would be hugely lavish and would
surprise many guests, with flowers jetted in from Holland to
decorate the venue.


Wang, who died April 3 aged 69, was Asia's richest woman, but she
was famous for wearing discounted clothes and dining out at fast-
food restaurants.


She built up the Chinachem Group into one of the city's largest
private companies after inheriting it from her husband Teddy
Wang, who disappeared in 1990, believed kidnapped.


Nina, who famously sported mini-skirts and pig-tails well into
her 60s, died leaving no heirs and never publicly named a
beneficiary.


Her lawyer Jonathan Midgely is reported to have said she left her
fortune to just one person, but would not reveal the identity of
this person until at least after her funeral.


She will be buried in a Catholic ceremony on April 18, according
to local media reports.


Wang's personal assistant Ringo Wong could not be reached for
comment.
