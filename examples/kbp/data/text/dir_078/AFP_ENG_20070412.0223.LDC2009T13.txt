Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica might make a counter-bid for
Olimpia, the holding company that owns 18 percent of Telecom
Italia, Italian newspaper the Corriere della Sera reported
Thursday.


The tire group Pirelli, which set up Olimpia with the apparel
maker Benetton, is currently in exclusive takeover talks with
American giant AT&T and its Mexican affiliate America Movil.


The newspaper said that Telefonica was in contact with the
Italian banks Intesa Sanpaolo and Mediobanca to finalise an offer
of at least 3.0 euros (4.0 dollars) a share in Olimpia.


AT&T and America Movil are offering 2.82 euros a share for 66
percent of Olimpia.


Intesa Sanpaolo and Mediobanca on Tuesday acknowledged receiving
"contacts" with potential investors in Telecom Italia, but did
not elaborate, while a Telefonica spokesman contacted by AFP
declined to comment.


Corriere said the bid may be announced after April 30, the
closing date of the exclusive negotiating period between Pirelli,
which owns 80 percent of Olimpia, and the North American bidders.


The news pushed Pirelli shares up 1.22 percent to 0.91 euros in a
weak market, while Telefonica dropped 1.06 percent to 16.79 euros
in negative overall trading.


Like America Movil, Telefonica is especially interested in TIM
Brasil, Telecom Italia's moblie telephone unit in Brazil.


TIM Brasil is the country's second cell phone operator after
Vivo, a subsidiary of Telefonica and Portugal Telecom, and is
positioned ahead of Claro, a subsidiary of America Movil.
