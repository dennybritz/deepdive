Former World Cup slalom champion Sebastien Amiez of France
announced his retirement on Thursday, 18 months after last
competing.


The 34-year-old from the Alpine ski resort of Moutiers, won his
World Cup title in 1996, but his greatest moment came at the 2002
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City where he won the slalom silver
medal. He was also a three-times French national champion in his
preferred discipline.


Injuries, particularly to his back, sidelined him in recent years
and he virtually lost his sight in his right eye a year ago after
being assaulted.
