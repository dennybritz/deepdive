The father of the BBC correspondent Alan Johnston held in the
Gaza Strip for one month appealed to his son's kidnappers to
release him immediately -- and urged him not to lose hope.


"I would like to say something to those who are holding you,"
Johnston's father Graham said in a letter read out to a news
conference in London.


"You have families. Please think about what this is doing to my
family, including in particular the distress and deep deep
concern Alan's mother and sister have had to endure for all these
long weeks," he said.


"As I have said before -- please -- let my son go, now, today!,"
he said, flanked by his wife and BBC staff.


In the letter, addressed to their son, Johnston's parents sought
to reassure him that they were coping with the situation, and
ended: "Chin up my Son ... Trini, Raymond, Alastair and, as
always, your ever-loving Mum and Dad"
