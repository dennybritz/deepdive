At least 15 people were injured Thursday after a ferry collided
with an unidentified object off South Korea's southern port of
Busan, coast guard officials said.


The accident occurred at about 0920 GMT, 23 kilometres (14 miles)
southeast of Busan, coast guard spokeswoman Kim Na-Yong told AFP.


The 125-tonne ferry carrying 215 passengers and eight crew
members from the Japanese port of Hakata took on water after
hitting the object.


"The ferry quickly repaired its damaged section after those
injured were transferred to patrol ships. It is sailing slowly
back to Busan with the remaining passengers," Kim said.


"We will question passengers to find out the exact cause of the
accident," he added.
