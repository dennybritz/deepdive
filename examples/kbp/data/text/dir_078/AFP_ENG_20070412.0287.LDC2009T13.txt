Legendary Russian cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich has
been hospitalised in Moscow for routine treatment, but is in no
danger, his spokeswoman said Thursday.


"He has been hospitalised for a routine procedure for three
days," Nataliya Dolezhal told AFP.


"It is not linked" to any worsening of his condition," she said,
declining to give further details.


The musician turned 80 in March. He was hospitalised in February
for a reported operation on a liver tumor and appeared pale and
tired during television footage of his birthday celebrations in
Moscow.


Rostropovich was born in Baku and studied in Moscow under the
celebrated composers Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev. He
went on to a glittering international career, much of it spent
abroad after he was persecuted, then expelled in 1974 by the
Soviet authorities.
