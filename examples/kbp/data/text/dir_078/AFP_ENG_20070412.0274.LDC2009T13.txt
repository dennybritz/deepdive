US President George W. Bush may meet Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi here before or after the Group of Eight (G8) summit
June 6-8 in Germany, the ANSA news agency reported Thursday.


"The meeting may take place during Bush's visit to Europe on the
occasion of the G8 summit, and the possibility of a stop in Italy
is being considered," Prodi's diplomatic advisor Stefano Sannino
told ANSA.


Italian media said the US president might also have an audience
with Pope Benedict XVI during his stop in Italy.


Relations between Rome and Washington have been strained in
recent months, notably over Italy's military mission in
Afghanistan and a plan to enlarge a US military base in
northeastern Italy.


In addition, an American marine will go on trial in absentia next
Tuesday for voluntary homicide over the killing of Italian secret
agent Nicola Calipari, who was shot dead in March 2005 on
Baghdad's airport road.


And another trial in absentia concerns 26 US intelligence agents
accused in the February 2003 kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric
from a street in Milan. The trial, the first involving the CIA's
programme of sending terrorism suspects to their home countries
to face possible torture -- formally opens on June 8.


Prodi took over from the staunchly pro-US Silvio Berlusconi after
hard-fought elections a year ago.
