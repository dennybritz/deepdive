China will not send its finance minister or central bank governor
to a Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington this week,
due to prior commitments, the foreign ministry said Thursday.


"Due to domestic scheduling the responsibles at the Ministry of
Finance and the People's Bank of China will not be able to attend
this meeting," foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told
journalists when asked about the G7 meet.


He refused further comment.


Speculation in Beijing has said that China is unhappy with an
ongoing row with the United States over intellectual property
rights and market access and is holding back its ministers after
Washington filed two complaints at the World Trade Organisation
this week.


China is not a member of the G7 but has frequently taken part in
some of the discussions during the G7 sessions.


The G7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
the United States while Russia rounds out the Group of Eight
(G8).


The gathering of the finance ministers of the world's seven
richest nations is to be held Friday, ahead of the annual
IMF/World Bank meeting in the US capital, which is expected to
focus on hedge funds.
