Manchester City manager Stuart Pearce says he is dumbfounded by
Fulham's sacking of coach Chris Coleman.


Coleman was sent packing following City's 3-1 win at Craven
Cottage, which left Fulham perilously close to the Premiership
drop zone after a poor run of results.


The Londoner's decision contrasts sharply with the attitude of
City chairman John Wardle, who refused to bow to calls for
Pearce's head and has been rewarded with a run of three wins and
a draw from the last four games which has virtually guaranteed
top-flight status next season.


"I can't understand it and I have spoken to a lot of people
connected with the game, managers and coaches, and they can't
understand it either,'' said Pearce.


"It seems to mirror society in a way. It is a little bit of a gut
reaction. "But then again, I base my personal life on being
consistent over a length of time.


"Personally, I find it quite strange Chris Coleman has been moved
on."
