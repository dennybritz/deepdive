German engineering giant Siemens said Thursday that it had
decided to set back the planned spin-off of its electronic car
parts unit VDO by one month owing to "tax issues."


Daily newspapers Sueddeutsche Zeitung and Financial Times
Deutschland quoted company sources as saying that the delay in
the spin-off, which will pave the way for an initial public
offering (IPO), was due to disagreements between management and
unions over employees' working conditions in the spun-off unit.


A Siemens spokesman said that "the timetable for a stock market
flotation is not in question" despite the delay in making the
unit a separate legal entity.


Siemens had announced at the end of January that it planned to
list 25-50 percent of VDO on the stock exchange, without
revealing a date for the operation.


Press reports have suggested that Siemens is also considering a
straightforward sale of VDO, which is coveted by rivals such as
German tyre and car parts specialist Continental.


VDO generates annual sales of around 10 billion euros (13.4
billion dollars) and employs a workforce of more than 50,000
worldwide.


Employees are concerned that, if the unit is sold, they could
suffer a similar fate to the employees of Siemens' former mobile
phone division, which was told to Taiwan-based BenQ in 2005, but
went bankrupt a year later.
