German fixed telecom network operator Versatel said Thursday it
planned to go public at the end of this month in what promises to
be one of the biggest initial public offerings in Germany this
year.


Versatel said in a statement that it expected to be listed on the
stock exchange from April 27.


It would embark on an investor roadshow from April 12 to 26, the
statement said.


The price range for shares on offer would be announced prior to
the start of the so-called subscription period on April 20, when
investors would then be able to apply for shares, the statement
said.


British private equity group Apax currently holds a 96-percent
stake in Versatel, the fourth-biggest fixed network operator in
Germany behind Deutsche Telekom, Acror and Hansenet.


The initial public offering (IPO) will include the issue of brand
new shares, plus the sale of existing shares by Apax.


Versatel said it expected to raise a net 419 million euros (562
million dollars) from the issue of new shares alone. Additional
funds would be raised from the sale of Apax's shareholding.


Newspaper reports earlier this month estimated that the IPO could
raise at least 800 million euros in all, which would be divided
between Apax and Versatel itself.


Versatel chief Peer Knauer has reportedly earmarked around one
third of total funds raised in acquisitions and investment, and
the rest in debt reduction.


Versatel said Thursday that the aim was to ensure that "at least
50 percent" of its share capital would be in free float following
the IPO.
