An explosion inside the Iraqi parliament building canteen on
Thursday killed two lawmakers and wounded at least 10 other MPs,
state television and a security source said.


A security source named one of the MPs as Mohammed Awad, from the
hardline National Dialogue Council political party, which is part
of the main Sunni Muslim bloc in the 275-member parliament.


The source said the other lawmaker killed was a member of the
Kurdish Alliance -- the second biggest grouping represented in
parliament after the main Shiite Muslim alliance.


Iraqiya television said two lawmakers had been killed and "more
than 10 wounded" in a bulletin at the bottom of its screen,
giving no further details.


The security source told AFP that about 10 security officials, in
addition to the 10 lawmakers cited by state television, had also
been wounded.
