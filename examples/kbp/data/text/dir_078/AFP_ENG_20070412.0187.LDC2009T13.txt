Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Thursday that talks on ending
North Korea's nuclear drive were making "clear progress," but
warned that long-term efforts were needed, according to a
Japanese official.


"The six-way talks are making clear progress," Wen said on a
visit to Tokyo to Mizuho Fukushima, head of the opposition Social
Democratic Party, according to a party official.


"Initial problems are almost being resolved, but further efforts
are needed for the entire denuclearisation of the peninsula," Wen
was quoted as saying.


"It is necessary to make long-term efforts for the entire peace
of Northeast Asia," he said. "In order to achieve the goal, both
China and Japan need to cooperate."


China is the main ally of North Korea and the host of six-nation
talks on disarming Pyongyang. Japan has tense ties with Pyongyang
and has taken the hardest line in the talks.


On Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Wen promised
in a joint statement to cooperate over the six-nation talks and
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.


Wen was paying a fence-mending visit to Japan at a time of hectic
diplomacy over North Korea, which has demanded it receive funds
from a blacklisted bank account before shutting down a nuclear
reactor.


New Mexico state governor Bill Richardson, who visited Pyongyang,
said Wednesday that North Korea had agreed to act within a day of
seeing the money that has been unfrozen at Macau's Banco Delta
Asia.
