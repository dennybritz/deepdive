The European Union will not join a WTO complaint lodged by the
United States against China for its alleged copyright abuse, said
a European commissioner Thursday.


"We will not join this complaint," Viviane Reding, European
Commissioner for Information Society and Media, told reporters at
a briefing. "We do not at this moment think that it is time for
the European Union to go to the WTO court."


Reding said the European Union would follow the complaint as an
observer and try in bilateral discussions and talks to find
solutions to the problem as the issue of intellectual property
rights was "high on the agenda."


"We agree with the substance that IPR (intellectual property
rights) has to be preserved and that there has to be a fair
remuneration for those who have invested into research and
development."


She said she had carried out intensive discussions on this issue
while meeting the Chinese minister of information industry.


She also had told the Chinese government to urge the nation's own
companies to tackle the problem, she said.


"I have asked the Chinese government to give a very explicit
signal to the industry that the industry has to solve the problem
of IPR through industrial negotiations," she said.
