Israel's Finance Minister Avraham Hirshson was questioned by
police again for six hours on Thursday as part of a probe into
corruption in a labour union he once headed, police said.


"Police investigators have completed questioning him for a fourth
time," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP. "He was
questioned for six hours by investigators in the national unit
for fraud investigations."


Police have been investigating Hirshson for weeks over suspicions
of involvement in aggravated robbery and fraud, embezzlement,
obstruction of justice and conspiring to commit a crime.


Hirshson has denied the allegations.


In January, police confirmed media reports that a graft probe had
been launched against Hirshson, the latest in a string of Israeli
officials to face corruption charges.


The allegations are part of an investigation into embezzlement of
millions of dollars from the right-wing National Workers
Federation labour body.


Corruption probes and other scandals involving senior Israeli
officials have rocked the Jewish state during the past six
months.


Among them have been several graft probes against Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert and a looming rape indictment against president Moshe
Katsav, who has since taken a leave of absence from the largely
ceremonial post.
