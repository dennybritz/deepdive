Former French prime minister Raymond Barre was in stable
condition in the intensive care unit of a Paris hospital on
Thursday, a day after he was admitted with heart and kidney
problems, a family member said.


Barre, who turned 83 on Thursday, was rushed by helicopter to
Val-de-Grace hospital in Paris after he fell ill in Monaco where
he had gone to deliver an address.


"He has been moved to the intensive care unit and his condition
is stable," said a relative.


Barre, who served under president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, has
suffered from kidney problems for years and regularly undergoes
dialysis treatment.  He also has a cardiac condition.


The economist, who has been living in the Riviera resort of Saint
Jean Cap Ferrat since he retired from politics in 2002, was taken
to the emergency unit of Monaco's Cardio-Thoracic Center on
Wednesday.


Barre was prime minister from 1976 to 1981 and mayor of France's
second city of Lyon from 1995 to 2001.


He had stirred up controversy last month when he accused the
"Jewish lobby" of making a "scapegoat" out of Nazi collaborator
Maurice Papon and praised far- right politician Bruno Gollnisch
in a radio interview.
