Ukraine's feuding political camps dug in Thursday with new rival
demonstrations in central Kiev the day after a top aide to
President Viktor Yushchenko suggested a concession aimed at
easing the country's crisis.


Several thousand supporters of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych
gathered on the capital's main square waving the blue flags of
the Regions Party, which leads the anti-Yushchenko coalition
dominating parliament.


A few hundred supporters of Yushchenko, waving the orange flags
of his Our Ukraine party, also gathered nearby.


The crisis, now in its second week, began when pro-Western
Yushchenko decreed the dissolution of parliament and new
elections. Yanukovych's Russian-backed allies have refused to
comply, resulting in constitutional paralysis.


According to Yushchenko's decree new parliamentary elections must
take place May 27. However, late Wednesday a top aide said the
decree could be suspended, thereby delaying any new polls.


This concession appeared to have been rejected by Yanukovych, who
said that he would only agree to new legislative elections if a
snap presidential election also took place -- something
Yushchenko has ruled out.
