The German competition authorities vetoed Thursday the planned
merger of Phonak and ReSound, the Swiss and Danish makers of
hearing aids and audio instruments, saying the tie-up would lead
to a dominant market position in Germany.


Germany is the second-biggest market for hearing aids behind the
United States and is currently dominated by manufacturers
Siemens, Phonak and Oticon, who together hold a market share of
more than 80 percent, the Federal Cartel Office said in a
statement.


Thus, a merger of Phonak of Switzerland and ReSound of Denmark,
would lead to an oligopoly -- or collective market dominance --
of Siemens, Phonak and Oticon, the watchdog argued.


"These companies are already closely knit via a number of
different business agreements and they coooperate in basic
patents and specific technologies," the statement said.


Competition in innovation was therefore restricted, the cartel
office said.


Phonak, which acquired ReSound last autumn for two billion euros
(2.7 billion dollars) in a deal that would create a world leader
in the hearing aid sector, said it would appeal the cartel office
ruling.


"We do not accept this decision and will immediately appeal to
the competent court in Duesseldorf," it said in a statement.


"We're hoping for a swift decision in order to obtain clarity on
the outcome on the transaction in the course of the summer."


In the wake of the cartel office veto, "the possible date for the
closing of the transaction has been postponed until the second
half of the year," Phonak said.
