Turkish police said Thursday they had detained a suspected
Kurdish bomber and seized 5.3 kilos (11.6 pounds) of plastic
explosives believed intended for attacks against police.


The 28-year-old woman was detained Sunday at Taksim square, the
heart of Istanbul's main business and entertainment district, a
police statement carried by the Anatolia news agency said.


Officers found the explosives in her backpack and detonated it in
a controlled explosion.


The woman, a suspected member of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK), was believed to have been planning an attack against
police, the statement said.


Three other people were also taken into custody on suspicion of
aiding and abetting her.


The statement said the explosives originated from northern Iraq
where, Turkey charges, several thousand PKK rebels have found
refuge, enjoying unrestricted movement, and are able to easily
obtain weapons.


More than 37,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the PKK
took up arms for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast of
Turkey.


The group, listed as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and much
of the international community, called a unilateral ceasefire
last year, but Turkey has rejected it.


Turkey has long pressed Baghdad and the United States to crack
down on PKK camps in northern Iraq and has threatened to carrry
out a cross-border operation if its allies fail to act.
