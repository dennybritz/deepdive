Shipping service and logistics giant United Parcel Service sealed
a deal Thursday for an independent air cargo hub in Shanghai, the
company said.


The ceremony marked the formal agreement for the hub between the
Shanghai Airport Authority and UPS following a memorandum of
understanding signed in July 2005.


The new hub, the fourth in Asia after the Philippines, Hong Kong
and Taipei, is expected to open next year.


It will link China through Shanghai's Pudong International
airport with direct services to the United States, Europe and
Asia.


The new complex in which UPS has invested 20 million dollars is
forecast to handle 17,000 pieces of cargo per hour by 2012.


The company has invested about 600 million dollars in China in
the last five years.


It currently employs 200 people at the Shanghai airport but
expects 1,000 people will work there by 2010.
