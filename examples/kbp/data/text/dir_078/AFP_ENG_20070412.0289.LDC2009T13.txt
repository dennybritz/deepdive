China will issue new regulations on natural gas use within two
months in a bid to ease supply shortages, state media reported
Thursday, citing an unnamed source within the state planning
body.


The country would impose restrictions on chemical industries
producing synthetic ammonia and formaldehyde -- which use natural
gas as a raw material -- to spare supply for other sectors, the
China Securities Journal reported.


The government would also raise the price of natural gas "in the
near future" to encourage energy efficiency, it said.


"The agency hopes the new policy will guide rational use of
natural gas and ease supply pressure as well," the source from
the National Development and Reform Commission was quoted as
saying.


The new policy would encourage oil companies to build more
natural gas pipelines and cities to put into service more buses
and taxis powered by natural gas, the report said.


China is trying to cut reliance on coal -- which accounted for 69
percent of its energy consumption in 2005 -- and shift to cleaner
energy like natural gas.


The country's natural gas production rose to 49.3 billion cubic
metres (1.73 trillion cubic feet) in 2005, almost doubling
production of 27.2 billion cubic metres in 2000, according to
official figures.


The growth in natural gas output in the period outpaced that of
any other form of energy, but supply was still falling short of
soaring demand, the report said.
