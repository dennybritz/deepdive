The Russian steel group Evraz, in which billionaire Roman
Abramovich owns a 41-percent stake, is in negotiations to buy
Canadian group IPSCO, the daily Vedomosti said on Thursday,
quoting sources close to the Russian company.


Negotiations started several weeks ago and are ongoing, one of
the Russian newspaper's sources said.


IPSCO is valued at about 6.13 billion dollars (4.56 billion
euros) on the New York stock exchange and the company last year
produced about four million tonnes of steel.


It reported a net profit of 643 million dollars.


Late last year Evraz bought US Oregon Steel Mills, a move which
it described at the time as giving it a "footprint" in north
America.


Evraz currently owns steel plants in Italy and the Czech Republic
in addition to major assets in Russia.
