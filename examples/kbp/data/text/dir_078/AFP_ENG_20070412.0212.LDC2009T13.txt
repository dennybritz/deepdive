Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema went before parliament on
Thursday to defend Italy's handling of the hostage crisis in
Afghanistan that involved a prisoner release and cost the lives
of two Afghans.


The session opened with a minute of silence for Afghan freelance
reporter Ajmal Naqshbandi, who was beheaded on Sunday, and Sayed
Agha, who was killed on March 16.


Naqshbandi had served as interpreter for Daniele Mastrogiacomo,
the journalist at the centre of the hostage crisis, while Agha
was his driver.


Mastrogiacomo was released on March 19 in exchange for the
freedom of five Taliban prisoners.


The deal angered many Afghans and prompted London and Washington,
among other Western capitals, to condemn negotiations with
"terrorists".


D'Alema said the "constant criterion" of Italian governments --
not just that of Prime Minister Romano Prodi -- was to "save the
life of hostage".
