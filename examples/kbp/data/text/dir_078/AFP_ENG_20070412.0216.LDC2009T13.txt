Guinea, the world's top bauxite exporter, is set to review all
contracts signed with foreign firms operating in the west African
country, government has said.


Spokesman of the two-weeks old government, Information Minister
Justin Morel Junior said authorities are to "review all mining
agreements, if need be amicably, but if not, we will hire legal
firms to defend the interests of the country".


Junior made the announcement Wednesday night on state television
after the first cabinet meeting of the new Guinean government led
by a consensus Prime Minister Lansana Kouyate, appointed late
February to end weeks of a bloody general strike.


Unions launched sweeping anti-government protests in January
paralysing the the poverty-stricken but mineral rich country of
9.4 million people, against the ailing President Lansana Conte.


After weeks of bloody street protests which claimed more than 100
lives of mainly civilians, Conte bowed in and appointed Lansana
Kouyate as a prime minister of consensus.


Kouyate formed his government on March 28.


Guinea has at least one third of the world's bauxite reserves, a
mineral used to produce aluminium.


Observers say the new government believes the mineral
exploitation contracts signed with foreign companies and reveiwed
several times, were made at a giveaway terms in this country
rated the most corrupt in the world.


Guinea, according to global anti-corruption watchdog Transparency
International is Africa's most corrupt country.


The former French colony is rated among the world's 20 poorest.
