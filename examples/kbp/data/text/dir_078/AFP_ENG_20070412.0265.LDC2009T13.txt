An explosion occurred in a canteen in the Iraqi parliament
complex inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone on
Thursday, causing casualties, a correspondent for state
television said.


Iraqiya television flashed the bulletin at the bottom of the
screen but no other details were immediately given.


The canteen is on the first floor of the huge Iraqi parliament
building, on the same floor as the 275-member national assembly's
main debating chamber.


Mobile telephones and landlines in central Baghdad around the
Green Zone were not able to be reached after the blast.


The US military said only it was tracking media reports of a
blast inside the sprawling Green Zone compound, also home to the
Iraqi government, foreign embassies and senior officials.


Attacks there are relatively rare with access heavily restricted
to visitors carrying picture identity cards and required to pass
through multiple checkpoints and metal dectectors.


Insurgents have, however, managed to fire projectiles such as
rockets and mortar rounds into the compound from outside its
heavily guarded walls.
