Voting was underway Thursday in Malaysia's western Malacca state
for a tiny but key by-election seen as a gauge of support for
opposition parties ahead of a possible early general election.


The contest is between Lai Meng Chong, fielded by the Malaysian
Chinese Association, part of Malaysia's ruling coalition, and the
opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP)'s Liou Chen Kuang.


Analysts say the DAP is not expected to win the by-election, but
that a reduced majority for the ruling coalition will show
growing support for opposition parties.


About 60 percent of some 9,600 voters in the rural state seat of
Machap had turned out by 3:00 pm (0700 GMT), the state Bernama
news agency reported.


Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak, who has been campaigning in
Machap, hailed what he said was a peaceful election, called after
a ruling coalition state lawmaker died.


"Security is under control. There's no tension, just the normal
competition," Bernama quoted him as saying.


In the last state poll in 2004, the ruling National Front
coalition won Machap by 4,562 votes, beating the DAP's Liou, who
Thursday was running for the second time.


Malaysia must hold a general election by early 2009, but
opposition parties say they expect Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi to call an election before then.


Results of the poll are expected from 1300 GMT.
