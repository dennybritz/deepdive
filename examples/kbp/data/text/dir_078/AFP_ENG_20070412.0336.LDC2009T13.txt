An explosion inside the Iraqi parliament building canteen on
Thursday killed two lawmakers and wounded at least 10 other MPs,
state television and a security source said.


The source named one of the MPs as Mohammed Awad, who is a member
of the National Dialogue Front, a Sunni Arab party led by MP
Salah al-Mutlak and which has 11 seats in the 275-member
parliament.


The source said the other lawmaker killed was a member of the
Kurdish Alliance, the second biggest grouping represented in
parliament after the main Shiite Muslim alliance.


Nevertheless, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, who is himself a
member of the Kurdish Alliance, could not confirm that when
contacted by AFP.


Iraqiya television said that two lawmakers had been killed and
"more than 10" other MPs in a bulletin at the bottom of its
screen, giving no further details.


The security source told AFP that about 10 security officials, in
addition to the 10 lawmakers cited by state television, had also
been wounded.
