An explosion occurred in a canteen in the Iraqi parliament
complex inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone on
Thursday, causing casualties, a correspondent for state
television said.


Iraqiya television flashed the bulletin at the bottom of the
screen but no other details were immediately reported.


Mobile telephones and landlines in central Baghdad around the
Green Zone, which is home to the parliament complex, did not
appear to be in service after the blast.


The US military said it was tracking media reports of a blast
inside the sprawling Green Zone compound, also home to the Iraqi
government and foreign embassies.
