Ukraine's pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko said Thursday
that his country was not considering hosting any elements of a US
anti-missile shield planned for eastern Europe.


"The question has not been put to us and Ukraine does not intend
to examine it," he told journalists during a televised press
conference in Kiev.


The United States has asked Ukraine's neighbours the Czech
Republic and Poland to host a radar system and interceptor
rockets respectively. Russia has sharply criticized the plan.


The level of Ukraine's integration with the NATO alliance is one
of the key issues fuelling a political stand-off between pro-
Russian and pro-Western politicians in the ex-Soviet republic.
