Irish budget airline Ryanair plans to start flying between Europe
and the United States within four years, with tickets priced a
low as 12 dollars, its chief executive has told a trade magazine.


Ryanair would create a longhaul no-frills carrier, independent of
Ryanair, that would mean the purchase of up to 50 widebody Airbus
A350s or Boeing 787s, Michael O'Leary told the latest edition of
Flight International.


Excerpts of the interview were released to media on Thursday
ahead of next week's publication.


Ryanair's push into the transatlantic market is being made
possible after EU transport ministers last month gave clearance
for plans to free up the transatlantic aviation market under a
long-sought "open skies" accord.


"By mid 2009, we will be carrying 70 million passengers at 23
bases across Europe," O'Leary told Flight International.


"It will be relatively straightforward for us to do a deal for 40
to 50 long- haul aircraft and connect these bases
transatlantically. There would be no one to touch us."


O'Leary said that revenues would be increased through the sale of
food, duty free goods and in-flight entertainment, while the new
carrier would offer a premier class.


He also told Flight International that he is looking to serve
five or six US cities from Ryanair's 23 European bases.


O'Leary said he expected the services, to secondary airports such
as Baltimore, Providence in Rhode Island and New York Long Island
Islip Macarthur "to be full."


The maverick boss added that has already received speculative
approaches from US airports.
