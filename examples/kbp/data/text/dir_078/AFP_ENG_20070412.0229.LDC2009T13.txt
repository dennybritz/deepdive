Porsche, the German maker of luxury sports cars, said Thursday
that it was investing 150 million euros (201 million dollars) in
expanding its Leipzig factory where it plans to build its new
Panamera model.


Porsche said in a statement that the car maker was adding 25,000
square metres of floor space to the existing plant as part of
preparations to build the four- door sports coupe Panamera, its
fourth model series, which is scheduled to be launched in 2009.


The sports utility vehicle Cayenne is currently being built at
Leipzig.
