Irish midfielder Stephen Ireland has signed a new four-year-
contract with Premiership side Manchester City.


Ireland has played 23 times for the Blues so far this season and
told www.mcfc.co.uk: "It's all well worth it now to get it signed
so I can concentrate on my football.


"I don't have to worry about my immediate future, I've got a long
contract now and it'll set me up for a few years to progress
myself and become a fixture in the side."


Ireland has also been on form with his national side scoring the
all-important winner against Wales in a Euro 2008 qualifier last
month.
