An explosion rocked the building which houses the Iraqi
parliament inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone on
Thursday, a US military spokesman confirmed.


"There was an explosion inside the Convention Centre. The cause
of the explosion is unknown at this time," Christopher Garver
said in an email.


The convention centre is the name given since the US-led invasion
of Iraqi in 2003 for the complex which now houses the Iraqi
parliament.


"The status of any wounded or killed individuals is unknown at
this time. Iraqi IZ (International Zone) security forces are
responding to the blast," he added.
