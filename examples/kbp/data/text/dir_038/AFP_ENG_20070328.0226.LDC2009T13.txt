Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Wednesday offered full
support to Britain in securing the release of 15 British sailors
captured by Iran last week.


Maliki met Britain's ambassador to Baghdad, Dominic Asquith, and
promised to investigate the incident in which the sailors were
detained.


"Iraq will make utmost efforts to reach a peaceful settlement on
the current crisis," a statement from Maliki's office quoted him
as telling Asquith.


The eight sailors and seven marines were seized at gunpoint in
the Shatt al-Arab waterway between Iraq and Iran on Friday,
triggering a new diplomatic storm between Iran and the West.


On Monday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said they had
been taken by Iranian guards from Iraqi territorial waters and
urged Tehran to release the 14 men and one woman.


Britain presented documentary evidence on Wednesday which it said
proved that they were in Iraqi waters and were unjustifiably
"ambushed."
