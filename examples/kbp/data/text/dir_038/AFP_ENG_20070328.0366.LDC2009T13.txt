The Bosnian Serb government moved Wednesday to help Srebrenica's
economic recovery following a threat by the town's Muslims to
separate it from the Serb- run entity.


The government had proclaimed Srebrenica as a territory of
"special social- economic importance," Administration and Local
Government Minister Zoran Lipovac told journalists.


Investments in Srebrenica, which would include projects by
electricity and road construction firms, would be worth more than
six million euros (eight million dollars), said Lipovac.


The Bosnian Serb government has invited different institutions
and companies to work out their development projects for
Srebrenica.


The decision came after Srebrenica's Muslim majority municipal
council adopted a resolution in which they demanded separation of
the eastern town from Republika Srpska.


Since its 1992-1995 war, Bosnia has had two entities, the Serbs'
Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.


In the final months of the conflict, Srebrenica was the scene of
the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.


On July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces overran the then UN-
protected enclave before summarily killing 8,000 Muslim men and
boys over several days.


Srebrenica Muslims adopted the resolution after the International
Court of Justice last month confirmed that the massacre amounted
to genocide.


Almost 12 years since the Srebrenica massacre, the two main
suspects wanted by the UN war crimes court in connection with the
crime, wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his
military chief Ratko Mladic, remain at large.
