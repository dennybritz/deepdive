South Korea moved a step closer to qualifying for the 2008
Beijing Olympics with a convincing 2-0 victory over Uzbekistan at
Ansan on Wednesday night.


They went ahead in the 34th minute when Han Dong-Won headed a
cross from Lee Keun-Ho. It deflected off a Uzbek defender,
leaving goalkeeper Ashurov Aziz with no chance of making a save.


Six minutes before the final whistle, Han volleyed home a headed
ball from a defender to make it 2-0.


South Korea attacked throughout the match and Kim Jin-Kyu led a
defence line-up that frustrated all efforts by the visitors to
score.


With three victories in a row, the South Koreans are top of Group
F, three points ahead of second-ranked Uzbekistan. The group also
includes the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.


The South Koreans will travel to Uzbekistan for their away match
on April 18. They play Yemen on May 16 before ending the second
round of preliminaries at home against the UAE on June 6.


The two top teams from each of the six groups in the second round
will advance to the final qualifying round, in which the 12 teams
will be divided into three groups.


The winners of each group in the final round will earn a berth in
the finals of 16 in the Olympic Games next year.
