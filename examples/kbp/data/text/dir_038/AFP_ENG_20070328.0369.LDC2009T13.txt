England coach Steve McClaren was spared an awkward selection
dilemma on Wednesday when Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was
ruled out of his side's Euro 2008 qualifier against group E
minnows Andorra with a cracked bone in his wrist.


Lampard suffered the injury when he was struck by a full-power
shot by Wayne Rooney in training on Monday. It was not initially
thought serious enough for him to miss the game but England
medics have since decided he should not be risked.


McClaren had been under pressure to drop Lampard in the wake of
Saturday's goalless draw with Israel, which has left England
struggling to qualify for next year's finals.


With Lampard ruled out, Steven Gerrard will be restored to the
central attacking role in midfield with Aaron Lennon and Stewart
Downing on the right and left respectively and Owen Hargreaves in
the holding position.


England were expected to make at least two other changes to the
line-up that started in Israel.


Ashley Cole returns from suspension to fill his usual slot at
left-back, at the expense of Liverpool's Jamie Carragher, while
Micah Richards takes over from Phil Neville at right-back.
