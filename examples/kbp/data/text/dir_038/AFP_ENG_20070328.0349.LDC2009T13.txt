A British servicewoman detained along with 14 other sailors will
be released "within a day or two", Iranian foreign ministry
spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told AFP on Wednesday.


Faye Turney is the only woman among the eight Royal Navy sailors
and seven marines Britain says were on a routine anti-smuggling
operation in Iraqi waters when they were seized at gunpoint in
the north of the Gulf on Friday.


Tehran says they entered Iranian territorial waters illegally.


Turney is a 26-year-old married mother of a girl aged three.
