Two Iraqi policemen were killed on Wednesday in multiple attacks
on a local government building in the former rebel town of
Fallujah, including truck bombs loaded with chlorine gas,
officials said.


Police Captain Abdul Sattar al-Jumaili said two policemen were
killed and one civilian was wounded in a coordinated attack.


US military officer First Lieutenant Shawn Mercer told AFP from
Fallujah that two suicide truck bombers exploded chlorine gas
close to the building.


"The bombers were engaged by the Iraqi police," he said, adding
that the insurgents also used mortars and small arms fire in the
attack.


The building also houses a joint Iraqi-US civil and military
centre, which usually acts as a window for unemployed Iraqis
searching for jobs, Jumaili said.


Insurgents have been increasingly using chemical bombs,
especially chlorine gas, on Iraqi security forces and civilians
in the past few months in the Sunni Anbar province that has
become a hotbed for Al-Qaeda fundamentalists.


On March 16, two Iraqi policemen were killed and 350 civilians
admitted in hospital after militants exploded chlorine tankers
near Fallujah.
