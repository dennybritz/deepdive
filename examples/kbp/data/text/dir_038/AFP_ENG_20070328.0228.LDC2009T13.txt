Angola on Wednesday denied its forces staged an incursion into
Democratic Republic of Congo last month, saying a diplomatic row
had been sparked by confusion over the hoisting of a flag near
the border.


"What happened is that ... elements of the police force,
including border guards, were conducting routine patrols and put
up a national flag in the village of Sakajinga" on the Angolan
side of their common border, Foreign Minister Joao Miranda was
quoted by state radio as telling parliament.


"This movement caused panic among some of the locals," he added.


The government in Kinshasa previously condemned what it said was
an Angolan incursion into the diamond-rich southwestern region of
Kahemba in February, accusing Angolan security forces of having
occupied 11 villages.


But the two sides have since sought to defuse the row, agreeing a
fortnight ago to establish a bilateral team to identify the 112
border markers between Angola and the DRC to enable "joint
patrols along the common frontier."


Miranda insisted that there had been "no incursion by Angolan
troops into the DRC", adding that the police had been operating
solely on Angolan territory.
