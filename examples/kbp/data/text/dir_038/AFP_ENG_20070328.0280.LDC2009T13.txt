South African rookie Cameron van der Burgh's only thought going
into the 50m breaststroke final Wednesday was not to finish last.
Instead he won a bronze medal.


Noone was more surprised than the 18-year-old.


"I can't describe it. I never even thought about it. It's my
first world championships," said the US-based nutrition student.


"I was a rookie in the field among all those veterans. I hope
this medal is going to be a kick to my career."


Ukrainian world record holder Oleg Lisogor won the event ahead of
American breaststroke king Brendan Hansen, but what made van der
Burgh most pleased was beating Japan's Olympic 100m breaststroke
champion Kosuke Kitajima.


"A couple of months ago I was still watching him on TV. I never
thought I could beat him," he said.


It was South Africa's second medal of the world championships
following Roland Schoeman's successful defence of his 50-metre
butterfly world title on Monday.


Schoeman scrapped into the final of the 100m freestyle on
Wednesday, along with his countryman Ryk Neethling. They both
swam 48.87 behind fastest qualifier Jason Lezak of the United
States (48.51).


Neethling said he was under a lot of pressure and it was nice to
prove some people wrong by making Thursday's showdown.


"There was a lot of pressure, I'm happy to get under 49 seconds
because it's been a very tough 18 months," he said.


"I've had injuries and I've moved programmes three times.
Johannesburg, then Pretoria and then back to Arizona."


"I had a big disadvantage and managed to step up and surprise
some people."
