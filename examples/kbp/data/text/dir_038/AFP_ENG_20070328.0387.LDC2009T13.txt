The White House Wednesday denied ratching up tension with Iran
with increased military exercises in the Gulf region, but
stressed US support for Britain as Iran holds 15 of its sailors.


"These military exercises were long planned and so there is no
escalation of tension on our part," spokeswoman Dana Perino said.


"Now, we do stand with our British allies and stand behind Tony
Blair as he works to get these 15 soldiers back from the
Iranians," she said.


On Tuesday, the Pentagon said the unusual exercise involving two
US aircraft carrier strike groups in the Gulf is aimed at
reassuring friends and allies, not raising tensions with Iran.


"We are not interested in confrontation in the Gulf," said
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.


Exercises involving two carrier strike groups are unusual because
two such naval formations are rarely in the same area at the same
time.
