German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday said Iran's seizure
of 15 British sailors was "unacceptable", and called on the
Islamic republic to release them immediately.


"It is unacceptable that 15 British soldiers were arrested and
held in Iran," she told deputies at the European Parliament in
Brussels.


"The British have our full solidarity here," added Merkel, whose
country holds the European Union's rotating presidency.


Her comments came after Germany demanded on Saturday the
"immediate release" of the sailors who were seized in Gulf waters
between Iran and Iraq on Friday.


Britain froze official contacts on Wednesday with Iran as the
dispute over 15 detained sailors intensified, with Prime Minister
Tony Blair vowing to "ratchet up" pressure on the Islamic state.


The bloc has vowed to do everything possible to secure the
release of the 14 British men and one woman who were seized by
its forces last Friday.


Iran claims they had entered its waters illegally and has defied
mounting pressure to free the whole group but has said it will
release the only woman among them.
