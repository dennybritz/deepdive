Defending champion Mark Williams was eliminated by Jamie Cope in
the second round of the China Open here Wednesday.


Cope fired breaks of 134, 68, 72, 104 and 86 as he cruised to a
5-1 win to end Mark Williams' chances of retaining his title.


Williams, who beat John Higgins 9-8 in last year's final, said:
"That's one of the best performances I've ever seen against me.
He hardly missed a ball and I didn't get much of a look-in."


"That's the best game I've played for a long time. If I keep
playing like that I can beat anyone, so maybe I could be the
champion," said Cope.


Cope faces Stuart Bingham in the last 16 after Bingham beat
veteran Steve Davis 5-4 with a tight final-frame decider.


Former world champion Shaun Murphy cruised to a 5-1 win over
Chinese wildcard Mei Xiwen with a breaks of 67, 58, 43, 43 and
54.


Murphy faces Stephen Maguire in the next round after the Scotsman
defeated Mark King 5-3.
