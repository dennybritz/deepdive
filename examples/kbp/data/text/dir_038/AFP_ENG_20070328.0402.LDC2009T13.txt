The slump in the US housing market has not yet spilled over to
the broader economy, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said
Wednesday, maintaining his outlook for "moderate" growth.


Bernanke, speaking to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
left intact his economic outlook while noting the risks from what
he said was an "uncertain" situation in the real estate market.


The central bank chief acknowledged the possibility of a more
severe downturn in housing, as well as manufacturing, which could
drag the overall economy lower. But for the moment, he said this
has not occurred.


"Thus far, the weakness in housing and manufacturing does not
appear to have spilled over to any significant extent to other
sectors of the economy," Bernanke said in his prepared remarks.


"Overall, the economy appears likely to continue to expand at a
moderate pace over the coming quarters."
