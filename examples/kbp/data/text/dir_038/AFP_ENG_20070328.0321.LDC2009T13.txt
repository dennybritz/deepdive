Orders for manufactured US durable goods rebounded 2.5 percent in
February, as demand for new aircraft picked up, the Commerce
Department said Wednesday.


The rebound in orders, however, was weaker than most Wall Street
analysts had forecast amid a slowdown of the wider US economy.


Most analysts had anticipated that orders for big-ticket
manufactured goods, including cars, aircraft and washing
machines, would increase 3.5 percent.


January's plunge in orders was revised deeper to a decline of 9.3
percent, compared with a prior estimate of an 8.7 percent drop,
marking the worst dropoff in demand in almost seven years.


Excluding the transport sector, orders fell 0.1 percent in
February following a decline of 4.0 percent in January.


Orders, excluding the defense sector, rose 2.5 percent after
falling 9.1 percent at the start of the year.
