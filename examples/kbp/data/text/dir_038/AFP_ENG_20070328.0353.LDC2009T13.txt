Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bat against South Africa in
their World Cup Super Eights match at the Guyana National Stadium
at Providence on Wednesday.


Play was due to start on schedule after a brief rain shower
delayed the toss by 10 minutes.


It is the first international match to be played at the new
stadium, outside the capital Georgetown, but the pitch looked in
good condition.


Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said he expected the pitch
to be similar to those normally found in Sri Lanka.


South Africa, needing a win to get their campaign back on track
after losing against Australia in St Kitts Saturday, brought in
left-arm spin bowler Robin Peterson in place of batsman Ashwell
Prince.


Seam bowler Farveez Maharoof returned for Sri Lanka in place of
Dilhara Fernando.


Sri Lanka already have two Super Eight points following a win
over fellow group qualifiers Bangladesh.


The weather was overcast, hot and humid with a possibility of
showers by midday followed by a brighter afternoon.
