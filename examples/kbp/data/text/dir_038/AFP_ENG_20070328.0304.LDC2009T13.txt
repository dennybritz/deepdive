Rookie Leila Vaziri joined the US ranks of world record breaking
swimmers on Wednesday when she smashed the women's 50m backstroke
mark in a semi-final at the world championships.


The 21-year-old from Florida touched in 28.16secs to shave German
Janine Pietsch's previous record of 28.19 set in 2005.


She heads into the final Thursday on a high.


"Tonight I definitely had in my mind to go that time," she said.


"The atmosphere was incredible. You just want to break the world
record so bad. It's been awesome."


She attributed her success to fellow record breaker Natalie
Coughlin, who has offered support and encouragement.


"I'm a rookie in the team, it's the best experience ever. It's so
much fun racing fast," she said.


"It's good to be in a situation in which all the coaches are
relaxed, having a good time."


"Natalie has been incredible in her performances. She really got
me going."


Also through to the final was Aliaksandra Herasimenia of Belarus
who qualified second fastest, Japanese pair Reiko Nakamura and
Mai Nakamura, and Chinese duo Zhao Jin and Gao Chang.
