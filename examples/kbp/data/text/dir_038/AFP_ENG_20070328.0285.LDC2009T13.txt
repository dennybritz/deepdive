Britain's Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said Wednesday that
Tehran had assured London that there was "no linkage" between its
seizure of British navy personnel and "other issues."


There has been speculation that the detention of 15 sailors and
marines last week could be linked either to Iran's standoff with
the West over its nuclear programme, or the detention of five
Iranians in Iraq.


But Beckett told lawmakers that Tehran has "assured us that there
is no linkage between this issue and other issues -- bilateral,
regional or international -- which of course I welcome."


British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Tuesday he hoped the
detention Friday of 15 British naval personnel was not linked to
the capture by US forces of five Iranians in Iraq.


"It should have absolutely no bearing at all, because any Iranian
forces who are inside Iraq are breaching the United Nations
mandate and undermining the democratically-elected government of
Iraq, so they have got no cause to be there at all," he said.


"The two situations are completely distinct."


As widely touted days beforehand, the UN Security Council on
Saturday imposed tougher sanctions on Tehran for its continued
refusal to freeze uranium enrichment, a process at the centre of
Western concerns that it may be seeking to build atomic weapons.
