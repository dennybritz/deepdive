The German presidency of the European Union on Wednesday
expressed concern over the arrest of Zimbabwean opposition leader
Morgan Tsvangirai and urged Harare not to harm him.


"It is with concern that we heard that Mr Tsvangirai has been
arrested again, not least because he was brutally mistreated last
time he was detained," Germany foreign ministry spokesman Jens
Ploetner said.


"We wish to remind the Zimbabwean government that we hold it
responsible for his physical health and safety," he added.


Zimbabwe's main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)
on Wednesday said their leader was arrested along with some 20
staff members at the party's headquaters in Harare.


Tsvangirai was also detained earlier this month when the MDC
tried to stage an anti-government rally on March 11. He suffered
head injuries after being assaulted in custody.


The MDC has vowed to topple President Robert Mugabe, who has
ruled the southern African state since independence in 1980. His
regime has in recent weeks stepped up its crackdown on the
opposition.
