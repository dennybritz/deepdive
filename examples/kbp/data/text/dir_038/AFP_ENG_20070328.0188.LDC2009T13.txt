Hong Kong telecom giant PCCW posted a 21 percent drop in full-
year 2006 net profit Wednesday as the company booked lower net
investment and other gains.


The fixed-line operator reported net profit of 1.25 billion Hong
Kong dollars (160 million US dollars), down from 1.60 billion
dollars in 2005.


"Profit attributable to equity holders of the company decreased
due to lower net investment and other gains booked in 2006," the
company said.


PCCW booked gains of just 42 million dollars last year against
626 million dollars a year earlier. It said the sale of PCCW's
entire 79.72 percent stake in Japanese game developer Jaleco in
2005 drove up investment gains in 2005.


Revenue for 2006 stood at 25.64 billion dollars, up from 22.50
billion dollars a year earlier.


At a press conference, chief financial officer Alex Arena said he
had been appointed its new managing director, replacing Jack So,
who tendered his resignation Wednesday.


The poor figures cap a torrid year for PCCW after its controlling
shareholder Richard Li, the son of tycoon Li Ka-shing, was
thwarted from selling his 23 percent stake in the company.


It followed the sidelining of two overseas companies from bidding
for the stake, a development media speculated had been driven by
second-largest shareholder, Beijing-controlled China Netcom's
reluctance to see the firm fall into foreign hands.


The government of Hong Kong denied it or Beijing had played a
role in preventing the sale to foreign interests.
