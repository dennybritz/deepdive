Management and labor are to mount a fresh bid Thursday to end a
15-day dockers' strike at the port of Marseille that threatens to
impose petrol shortages in France starting next week.


A meeting at the regional government headquarters will bring
together the CGT trade union and management representatives from
the key Mediterranean port and French gas utility GDF.


The CGT launched the strike on March 14 to demand the recruitment
of port workers at a new GDF gas terminal at Fos-sur-Mer. GDF
argues that for safety reasons it will employ only its own staff.


The action has depressed activity in roughly half the country's
13 refineries.


About 50 ships, including 26 oil tankers, were earlier this week
anchored off the port.


"The lack of supplies means that some refineries are going to
start eating into reserves from this week and slowing down
production. The first problems for private consumers could appear
at the start of April," said Jean-Francois Cousinie, of the
French Union of Petroleum Industries.


An association of small and medium-sized businesses appealed to
governing authorities on Wednesday "to take vigorous" action to
bring the stoppage to a close, warning that its economic effects
could begin to have a negative impact on the nation as a whole.


"The French economy must not again be held hostage to a labor
dispute that could paralyse fuel supplies," the associaiton, the
CGPME, insisted in a statement.
