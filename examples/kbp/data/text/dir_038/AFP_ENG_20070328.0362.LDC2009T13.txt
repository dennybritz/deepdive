Iran said on Wednesday it will release "within a day or two" a
British servicewoman whose detention along with 14 male
colleagues has set off a major diplomatic row with London.


"The woman will be released within a day or two," foreign
ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told AFP, adding that
"preliminary investigations" were going on for the 14 others navy
and marine personnel.


Faye Turney is the only woman among the eight Royal Navy sailors
and seven marines Britain says were on a routine anti-smuggling
operation in Iraqi waters when they were seized at gunpoint in
the north of the Gulf on Friday.


Tehran, which is already at odds with the West over its
controversial nuclear programme, says they entered Iranian
territorial waters illegally.


Earlier an Arabic-language Iranian television station said it
would broadcast "new footage" of the 15, whose detention has
prompted Britain to freeze ties with Tehran.


Al-Alam also said it would air an interview with Turney, a 26
-year-old married mother of a girl aged three.


A representative of the station said it would be shown in one or
two hours.


British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett earlier announced a
freeze on all official ties with the Islamic state as Prime
Minister Tony Blair vowed to increase pressure on Tehran, which
he said faces "total isolation."
