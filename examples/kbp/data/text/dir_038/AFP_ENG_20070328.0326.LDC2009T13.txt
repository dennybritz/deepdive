Azerbaijan plans to boost oil production to record levels this
year and to double crude output by 2010, Energy Minister Natiq
Aliyev said Wednesday.


"Azerbaijan has reached the highest level of extraction in the
entire history of its oil development and plans to surpass this
level in 2007 with up to 42 million tonnes of oil," Aliyev said
at a press conference.


The energy-rich ex-Soviet state on the Caspian Sea produced 32
million tons of crude last year, Aliyev said.


By 2010 Azerbaijan will be producing 65 million tons of oil a
year, surpassing earlier estimates of 50 million tons, he said.


Natural gas production is expected to reach 30 billion cubic
metres in 2010, he added.


Azerbaijan, which is strategically located on Iran's northern
border, has become a key Western partner in tapping the vast
energy reserves of the Caspian Sea.


Crude supplies began last year via the four-billion-dollar
(three-billion-euro) Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which bypasses
Russia to deliver Caspian oil to Turkey and on to Western
markets.


On March 22 US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice inked an
alliance with Azerbaijan aimed at promoting energy pipelines
capable of competing against Russia's grip on the regional energy
market.


The deal called for a "high-level dialogue... to deepen and
broaden already strong cooperation among governments and
companies to expand oil and gas production in Azerbaijan," the
State Department said.
