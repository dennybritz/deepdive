Four young Muslims were charged in Denmark on Wednesday with
planning terrorist bombings in Denmark or abroad, the justice
ministry said.


The four men were accused of acquiring chemicals and laboratory
instruments to make triacetone triperoxide (TATP) explosives,
often used by suicide bombers.


TATP bombs were used in the July 2005 London bombings.


The identities of the four were not disclosed. They are residents
of Denmark but do not hold Danish citizenship.


The men were part of a group of nine people arrested in a
September 2006 swoop in Odense in central Denmark.


Three of the nine had been remanded in custody, while the six
others, including the fourth person indicted on Wednesday, were
released.


At the time of the raid, Danish Justice Minister Lene Espersen
said that the discovery of the alleged terrorist cell was "the
most serious" such case Denmark has known.


If convicted, the four face life sentences.


In a separate terrorism case in Denmark, a 17-year-old Dane of
Palestinian origin, Abdul Basit Abu-Lifa, was in February
convicted of planning a terrorist attack in Europe and was
sentenced to seven years in prison.


Three other men also on trial, aged 18, 20 and 21, were acquitted
by the Copenhagen court.


The group had been arrested in October 2005 in raids in and
around Copenhagen.


They were accused of having helped two accomplices, a Swede of
Serbian- Montenegrin origin and a Turkish-born Dane, travel to
Sarajevo to acquire explosives and weapons aimed at carrying out
a terror attack in Europe.
