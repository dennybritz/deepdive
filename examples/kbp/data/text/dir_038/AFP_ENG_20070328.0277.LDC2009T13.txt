Italian power company Enel said on Wednesday it was prepared to
take legal action against the Spanish stock market regulator for
delaying its bid for Spanish electricity group Endesa by six
months.


"We hope to be able to launch the offer for Endesa within six
months," Enel managing director Fulvio Conti told a meeting of
analysts in London.


Enel and another group, Acciona, a Spanish construction
enterprise, hold 46 percent of Endesa and plan to mount a joint
drive for a full takeover if rival E.ON of Germany fails to win
the backing of 50 percent of Endesa shareholders.


Enel and Acciona have offered at least 41 euros a share for
Endesa, valuing the company at 43.4 billion euros (57.6 billion
dollars).


The bid by E.ON, 40 euros per share, expires April 3. A ruling by
the Spanish regulator, the CNMV, prevents Enel and Acciona from
making a formal offer for six months from that date.


"I don't expect E.ON to be able to get more than 50 percent
backing," Conti said. "We will put forward our offer as soon as
possible -- I hope before the six months imposed by the CNMV."


Conti said that Enel was planning to take legal action against
the decision by the CNMV.


"The regulator must allow the parties to make their offers," he
said.


"We are going to take legal action to enable us to launch our bid
as soon as that of E.ON is finished."


Conti stressed that Enel would not sell any of Endesa's assets if
it won control of the company. In addition to Spain, Endesa is
active in France, Poland, Turkey and Latin America.
