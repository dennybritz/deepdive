Greek police seized a haul of ancient coins, tools and other
objects and arrested four men accused of trafficking in
antiquities, police in the northern port of Salonika said on
Tuesday.


The four men, aged 45 to 57, were arrested in the town of
Elassona on Monday after attempting to sell five silver coins
from the Hellenistic era to an undercover police officer for
2,500 euros (3,300 dollars) apiece.


A fifth man is sought in connection with the case, the local
police chief told a news conference.


Police found 45 ancient objects at the suspects' homes, including
a stone millstone and axe, clay vessels and iron tools and nail
remains.


The authorities suspect that the items were looted from ancient
tombs in Thessaly, an antiquity-rich area in central Greece that
has been inhabited since Prehistoric times.
