A gunman who held a busload of children and teachers hostage for
10 hours in the Philippines surrendered late on Wednesday after
releasing them and was taken away by police.


Amando "Jun" Ducat was handcuffed by police as he was escorted
off by a lawmaker who had gone on board the bus to negotiate the
release of the 31 pre-schoolers and two teachers.


But there was confusion about the whereabouts of up to two other
gunmen who were earlier reported to have been on board the
vehicle, which was driven away by the police after Ducat's
surrender.
