Britain presented documentary evidence Wednesday which it said
proved that 15 sailors and marines detained by Iran last week
were in Iraqi waters, claiming they were unjustifiably
"ambushed."


The British personnel were 1.7 nautical miles within Iraqi
waters, said Vice- Admiral Charles Style, presenting maps and
global positioning system (GPS) data on the seizure in the Gulf
last Friday.


"The action of the Iranian forces is unjustified and wrong. As
such it is a matter of deep concern," said Vice-Admiral Charles
Style, adding that London "unambiguously" contests Iran's claims
that they were in Iranian waters.


He added that Iran, in negotiations with British officials, had
given two locations for the seizure -- the first of which was
within Iraqi waters, and the second within Iranian waters.


London insists that the eight sailors and seven marines were
conducting routine anti-smuggling operations when they were
seized at gunpoint in the Shatt al-Arab waterway in the north of
the Gulf on Friday.


Tehran says they had intruded into Iranian waters, though that
claim is contested by Iraq.


The Britons' detention has triggered a mounting crisis between
London and Tehran, which is already facing increasing pressure
from the West over its nuclear plans.


British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett cut short a trip to
Turkey on Tuesday to deal with the crisis, and was due to make a
statement to lawmakers in London Wednesday.
