Britain is freezing all ties with Iran over the detention of 15
sailors and marines in the Gulf, Foreign Secretary Margaret
Beckett said Wednesday.


"We are now in a new phase of diplomatic activity....We need to
focus all our bilateral efforts during this phase on the
resolution of this issue," she said.


"We will therefore be imposing a freeze on all other official
bilateral business with Iran," she added in a statement to
lawmakers on the crisis between London and Tehran.


"We will keep other aspects of our policy towards Iran under
close review and continue to proceed carefully. But no-one should
be in any doubt of the seriousness with which we regard these
events," she added.


The statement came after British military officials unveiled
documentary evidence they said showed the Britons were 1.7
nautical miles (3.15 kilometres) inside Iraqi waters when they
were detained.


British Prime Minister Tony Blair also vowed to "ratchet up"
international pressure on Tehran, which it said faced "total
isolation" over the stand-off.


London insists the eight sailors and seven marines were
conducting routine anti- smuggling operations when they were
seized at gunpoint in the north of the Gulf on Friday.


The Britons' detention has triggered a mounting crisis between
London and Tehran, which is already facing increasing pressure
from the West over its nuclear plans.
