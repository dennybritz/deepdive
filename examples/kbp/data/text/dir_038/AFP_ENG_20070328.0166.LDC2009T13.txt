Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya said on Wednesday that
substantial progress had been made towards securing the release
of an Israeli soldier captured by Gaza militants nine months ago.


"There have been contacts with our brothers in Egypt and the
resistance factions which captured the soldier and I can confirm
there has been major progress," Haniya told AFP in Riyadh, where
Arab leaders are meeting for their annual summit.


"But it will require some time, I hope days," Haniya said.


"But that depends on the Israelis," he added, in an apparent
reference to demands that Israeli release Palestinian prisoners
in exchange.


Gaza militants, including some from the military wing of Haniya's
Islamist Hamas movement, seized Corporal Gilad Shalit in a deadly
cross-border raid last June, triggering a massive Israeli
offensive on the territory.


Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said last week he hoped Shalit
would be freed soon, but Israel has accused him of reneging on a
promise to ensure he would be released before the formation of
the new national unity government.
