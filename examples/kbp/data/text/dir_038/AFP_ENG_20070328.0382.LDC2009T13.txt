UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned the situation in the
Middle East was more dangerous than ever in a speech to the
opening session of an Arab summit in Riyadh on Wednesday.


"The Middle East region is more complex, more fragile and more
dangerous than it has been for a very long time," said Ban, one
of several world figures invited to the opening of the two-day
gathering.


"For most in the Arab world, the wound that is still fresh even
after 40 years is the continued (Israeli) occupation of Arab
territory and the denial of legitimate Palestinian claims to
statehood," he said.


"The basis for a solution is clear -- an end to the occupation
that began in 1967, the creation of an independent and viable
Palestinian state alongside a secure and fully recognised state
of Israel, and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the
region," Ban said.


The UN chief, who plans to visit Lebanon as part of a regional
tour that also took in Iraq, said that the political stalemate in
Lebanon "threatens to undermine one of the region's most vibrant
societies," while the violence in Iraq "continues to take a
shocking daily toll in civilian lives."


Ban also visited Israel and the West Bank in a bid to revive
Middle East peace talks before coming to Riyadh, where the Arab
summit is expected to revive a 2002 plan for peace with the
Jewish state.
