Police faced off against stick-wielding Islamic students in the
Pakistani capital Wednesday after four female teachers were
arrested for abducting a brothel owner, officials said.


Female students from the Jamia Hafsa religious school near
Islamabad's Red Mosque abducted the alleged brothel boss and two
other women on Tuesday night, the seminary's vice principal,
Abdul Rashid Ghazi, told reporters.


Police arrested the teachers on Wednesday when they left the
school to go to another madrassa, Ghazi said.


He warned of a "holy war" if they were not released by 4:00 pm
(1100 GMT).


The incident triggered tensions in the capital and male students
waving bamboo sticks said they had commandeered two police vans
and were holding one of the drivers until the teachers were
released.


Hundreds of students from other madrassas have also gathered
inside the mosque, many armed with bamboo sticks.


Some were said to have firearms but were not seen displaying
them, an AFP reporter at the scene said.


The Jamia Hafsa madrassa is already at the centre of a two-month
standoff after girl students occupied a nearby government-run
children's library in protest at official plans to demolish a
mosque in the capital.
