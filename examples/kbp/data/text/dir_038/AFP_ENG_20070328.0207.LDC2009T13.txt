The Palestinian government expects to receive a pledge of 2.7
billion dollars in aid at the Arab summit that opened in Riyadh
on Wednesday, finance minister Salam Fayyad said.


"We hope to obtain the necessary financial support for 2007,
which totals 2.7 billion dollars," Fayyad said told AFP.


"We expect Arab leaders to approve today a draft resolution
submitted to them on continuing financial aid to the Palestinian
Authority for a year to the tune of 55 million dollars per month.


"There are 1.7 billion dollars in arrears not paid by some Arab
brothers last year," he said.


"We need urgent assistance and we cannot obtain it without the
implementation of the resolution providing for continuing the aid
and paying arrears," Fayyad said.


"The Palestinian Authority needs to settle 643 million dollars in
unpaid salaries (to civil servants), and we hope that the summit
will cover them," he added.


The Palestinian Authority has been squeezed by an Israeli and
international boycott which came after the Islamist movement
Hamas forming a government last year following an electoral route
of the long-ruling Fatah party.


Hamas and president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah formed a unity
government earlier this month.


But the international Quartet (United States, European Union,
United Nations and Russia) has linked a lifting of the boycott to
Hamas meeting demands to recognise Israel, renounce violence and
abide by past agreements with Israel.


Last year's Arab summit in Khartoum decided to keep up aid of 55
million dollars a month to the Palestinian Authority, but many
countries fail to pay their contributions.
