The German cabinet on Wednesday approved an amendment to the
country's immigration act which will enable some 180,000 rejected
asylum seekers living in Germany to apply for residency.


The bill states that those who have been in the country for at
least six years and have a basic knowledge of German will be able
to apply for temporary residency as from July.


Successful candidates will be allowed to remain in the country
legally beyond 2009 if they have found jobs.


The bill does not apply to an estimated one million foreigners
who are living in Germany illegally and have never applied for
asylum.


It only covers those who were refused asylum but cannot be
deported because they are thought to be at risk in their home
countries.


Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the bill would bring
Germany in line with EU asylum regulations and tried to ease
concerns raised by several regions that it will see foreigners
overburden the country's social system.


"This is not about draining resources but about giving them
greater access to the job market," he told reporters.


The bill now needs to be approved by parliament where the ruling
coalition holds a comfortable majority.
