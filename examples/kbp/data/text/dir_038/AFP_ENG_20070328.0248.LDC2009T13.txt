A gunman holding a busload of pre-schoolers and two teachers in
the Philippine capital of Manila released them all late on
Wednesday, ending a 10-hour standoff.


Some of the children kissed the hostage-taker, pre-school boss
Amando "Jun" Ducat, as they were helped off the bus by police and
emergency workers.


Ducat later surrendered to police, handing over two grenades he
had held to a politician who had gone aboard the bus to negotiate
the surrender.
