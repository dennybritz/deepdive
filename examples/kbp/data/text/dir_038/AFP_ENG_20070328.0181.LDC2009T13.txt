British military officials presented maps Wednesday which they
said proved that 15 sailors and marines detained by Iran last
Friday were in Iraqi waters when seized.


The British military personnel were 1.7 nautical miles within
Iraqi waters, they said.


"The action of the Iranian forces is unjustified and wrong. As
such it is a matter of deep concern," said Vice-Admiral Charles
Style, adding that London "unambiguously" contests Iran's claims
that they were in Iranian waters.
