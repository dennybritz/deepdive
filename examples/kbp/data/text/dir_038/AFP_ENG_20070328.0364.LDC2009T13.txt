Australian striker Scott McDonald is set to join Scottish
champions Celtic in the summer, his present club side Motherwell
said on Wednesday.


The 23-year-old nearly clinched a move to Celtic's Glasgow rivals
Rangers in January, but Celtic are believed to have offered a
higher transfer fee than the 400,000 pounds (590,000 euros) put
on the table by the Ibrox outfit.


The transfer to Celtic of McDonald, whose contract runs out at
the end of next season, is expected to be sealed by the end of
the week, with the deal subject to him passing a medical.


Motherwell boss Maurice Malpas said: "It is well known that Scott
wants to move on from Fir Park.


"The club has succeeded in securing a healthy transfer fee for
him and ensuring that he will remain with us to the end of the
season.


"No club would wish to lose a player of Scott's quality but we
wish him well in the future."


McDonald has hit 12 goals in 34 appearances for Motherwell this
season, including one in the 2-1 defeat to Celtic in October.


He will be best known to Celtic fans, however, for the late
double he struck against them for Motherwell on the final day of
the 2004/05 season which handed the Premier League title to
Rangers.


The former Southampton trainee told www.motherwellfc.co.uk: "I
have thoroughly enjoyed playing for Motherwell and I will leave
with a lot of good memories.


"I hope the fans appreciate that I want to move on and develop my
career and I would like to thank them for the support they have
given me."
