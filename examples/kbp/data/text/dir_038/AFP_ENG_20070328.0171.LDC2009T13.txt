Britain's Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that American author
Dan Brown did not steal key elements from an earlier book for his
blockbuster novel "The Da Vinci Code".


Last April, Brown was cleared by the High Court of accusations
that he breached copyright by plagiarising passages and ideas
from "The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail", for his 2003 book.


Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, two of the earlier book's
authors, took their case to the appeal court and now face a legal
costs bill approaching three million pounds (six million dollars,
4.5 million euros).


"The Da Vinci Code" has sold more than 40 million copies around
the world, has been translated into 44 languages and has made
Brown into a dollar multi- millionaire.


The best-selling author did not attend the appeal hearing.
