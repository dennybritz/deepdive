French director Luc Besson will step behind the camera once again
before retiring, he said in Sofia on Wednesday.


Besson, in Bulgaria to promote his latest film "Arthur and the
Minimoys", has previously announced that the movie, which is his
10th, would be his last.


"The thing is just that I am tired and a little dried up. There
is an old saying in French: 'If you have nothing to say, just
shut up'," 48-year-old Besson told a press conference.


"After 30 years I do not have enough strength to do another film
because it is a hard job and you have to be sure to come with
something fresh, not to repeat yourself."


"Right now that is it. I am going to do 'Arthur 2' for sure. But
that is different, it is not new, it is a continuation," he said
about what will be a sequel.


Besson's films include "The Big Blue", "Nikita", and "The
Professional," and he is himself the author of the Arthur book
trilogy, which features "Arthur and the Minimoys", "Arthur and
the Forbidden City" and "Arthur and the Revenge of Malthazard".


Still, plans are never final and shooting the sequel might not be
the end of his career as director after all, he said Wednesday.


"If in one week, one month, one year I feel that I have the
strength, I will bother you for two more hours," Besson said with
a smile.
