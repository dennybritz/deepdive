Countries such as China will not be able to develop higher-tech
economies until adequate protections are in place for
intellectual property, a top US copyright official warned
Wednesday.


"A nation that does not give the highest protections for
intellectual property... will consistently be a source of only
second-class technology. No one will want to bring their
technology to a nation that doesn't protect it," said Jon Dudas,
director of the US Patent and Trademark Office.


Dudas was reacting to a suggestion by a Chinese Cabinet member a
day earlier that developed countries must be patient with
intellectual property rights (IPR) violations in countries like
China since developed countries hold most key technology patents.


Dudas, who is also undersecretary of commerce for intellectual
property, is in Beijing for a global IPR forum and separate
discussions with Chinese officials on strengthening protections.


Rampant IPR violations are a major source of friction in
bilateral trade ties and Washington has pressured China to do
more to combat them.


Dudas praised what he called China's growing recognition of the
problem and its "broader, deeper" recent cooperation with the
United States on the issue.


But he said Beijing needs to do more, such as lowering punishment
thresholds as part of a push to create a stronger system of
deterrents.


Despite increased efforts by China, 81 percent of the counterfeit
products seized at US borders originate in China, Dudas said.
