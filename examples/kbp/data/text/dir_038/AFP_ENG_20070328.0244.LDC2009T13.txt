British Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed Wednesday to crank up the
diplomatic pressure on Tehran over its detention of 15 naval
personnel, saying Tehran faced "total isolation" in the stand-
off.


"It is now time to ratchet up the diplomatic and international
pressure" on Tehran, he said, adding that "there was no
justification whatever" for their detention in the Gulf last
Friday.
