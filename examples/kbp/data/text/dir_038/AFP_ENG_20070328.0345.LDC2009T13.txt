US President George W. Bush Wednesday again warned lawmakers that
he would veto any firm timetable for withdrawing US troops from
Iraq as the Senate was poised to vote on the issue.


Bush said the budget bills have too much extra spending, "too
many conditions on our commanders, and an artificial timetable
for withdrawal."


"As I have made clear for weeks, if either version comes to my
desk, I will veto it. And it is also clear from the strong
opposition in both houses that my veto would be sustained," Bush
said in remarks released by the White House ahead of a speech
later Wednesday.


The Senate could vote as soon as Wednesday on a war spending bill
that includes a deadline to withdraw US soldiers from Iraq by
March 31, 2008 after Democrats beat a Republican attempt to take
the timeline out of the legislation.


The upper chamber voted 50-48 Tuesday against a Republican
amendment that would have removed the pullout timetable from the
Iraq and Afghanistan war emergency spending legislation.


"Some Democrats believe that by delaying funding for our troops,
they can force me to accept restrictions on our commanders that I
believe would make withdrawal and defeat more likely. That's not
going to happen," he said.


"If Congress fails to pass a bill to fund our troops on the front
lines, the American people will know who to hold responsible," he
said.
