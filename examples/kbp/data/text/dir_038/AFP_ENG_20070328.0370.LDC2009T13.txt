A Croatian court on Wednesday acquitted a former elite police
officer of charges that he killed 13 prisoners during the
country's war of independence, a judge said.


"Mihajlo Hrastov is cleared of the charges," Karlovac county
court judge Marijan Janjac said at the end of a third retrial of
the former member of a special police unit.


Hrastov was charged with executing 13 Serb soldiers of the
Yugoslav Peoples' Army who had been taken prisoner in the central
town of Karlovac in September 1991.


The court accepted Hrastov's plea that he shot at the soldiers in
self-defence after one of the prisoners attacked another member
of the Croatian security forces.


At the time, "Karlovac was under air raid alert, the city was
being shelled and snipers were lurking," said Janjac.


The prosecution said it would appeal the verdict before the
Supreme Court, which has already overturned the two previous
sentences clearing Hrastov.


Some 20,000 lives were lost in Croatia's 1991-1995 war.
