The president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kabila,
left for Tanzania on Wednesday to take part in a two-day regional
summit examining the crises in his country and in Zimbabwe.


kabila, who had not been expected to attend the summit, left for
the meeting accompanied by his minister for foreign affairs and
international cooperation, Antipas Mbusa Nyamwisi.


The 14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC)
summit, hosted by Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, comes amid
a growing global outcry over turmoil in Zimbabwe that threatens
to spill over to its neighbours.


It also takes place after deadly clashes last week in DRC,
between the military and militia loyal to former vice-president
and ex-rebel chief Jean Pierre Bemba, that claimed between
200-500 lives.
