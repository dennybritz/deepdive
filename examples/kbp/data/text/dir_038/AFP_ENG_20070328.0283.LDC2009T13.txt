A prominent Iranian MP said on Wednesday Britain should apologise
if it is proved that its detained sailors had mistakenly entered
Iranian waters, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.


"If it is proven that a mistake has been made the issue will be
resolved with an apology from the British government," deputy
parliament speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar said.


His comments came shortly before Britain announced it was
freezing all ties with Iran over the seizure of 15 sailors and
marines in the Gulf last Friday.


Iran insisted that the 15 were taken in Iranian waters, after
British military officials unveiled documentary evidence they
said showed they were inside Iraqi waters.


Bahonar described the alleged entry into Iranian waters as an
"obvious aggression" and said: "If it is proven to be
intentional, the British government should explain its aim and
clarify how it is going to compensate."
