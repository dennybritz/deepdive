An Arabic-language Iranian television station said on Wednesday
it would broadcast "new footage" of 15 British sailors being held
by Iran.


Al-Alam also said it would air an interview with the sole woman
among the 15 navy and marine personnel who were seized in the
Gulf between Iran and Iraq on Friday.


However, it did not say when it would show the footage.
