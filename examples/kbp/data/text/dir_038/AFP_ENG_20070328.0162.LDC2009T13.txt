Michael Phelps annihilated his world record in the 200-metres
butterfly to seize his third gold medal in another astonishing
performance at the world swimming championships Wednesday.


The 21-year-old American carved a massive 1.71 seconds off his
own world record to set a new mark at one minute 52.09 seconds.


Phelps was 1.78secs under his record at the 150m mark and was
well in front of the red-line used in the television race
coverage to signify the world record.


He had held the previous mark at 1:53.80 and had bettered that
last February in Missouri when he swum another world record of
1:53.71 which governing body FINA has yet to officially ratify.


Phelps has now set two world records at the meet after his
stunning win over Pieter van den Hoogenband in Tuesday's 200m
freestyle final.


"I surprised myself, I went so fast," Phelps said. "I wanted to
go 1:52.00 but I didn't expect to swim 1:52.00.


"I'm showing I'm in solid shape now. I had a really good swim
earlier in the season where I broke the world record.


"I wanted to take it out tonight, so I'm pretty happy."


Phelps still has five more events to come as he chases a record
eight gold medals at the championships in his campaign to
overtake Mark Spitz's Olympic record of seven swimming gold
medals at next year's Beijing Olympics.


Wednesday's victory was the American's 13th career gold medal at
the world championships and he is now the only swimmer to have
won the 200m butterfly world title three times.


He was the champion at the 2001 and 2003 world championships but
left the event off his schedule at Montreal in 2005.


China's Wu Peng was second in the final in 1:55.13 with Russia's
Nikolay Skvortsov taking the bronze in 1:55.22.
