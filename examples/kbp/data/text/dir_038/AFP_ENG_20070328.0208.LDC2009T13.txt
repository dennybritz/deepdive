Iran insists that 15 British navy personnel it detained last week
were in Iranian waters, but is "confident" London and Tehran can
resolve the stand-off, the Iranian embassy here was quoted as
saying Wednesday.


"We're confident the two governments are capable of resolving
this security case through their close contacts and cooperation,"
said the statement, received by Sky News television from Tehran's
embassy in London.


But it insisted that last Friday the 15 Britons "illegally
entered Iranian territorial waters," adding: "This was a
violation of (an) international border ... an intrusive act
justified their detention."
