China finally got itself a medal at the world championships on
Wednesday with Wu Peng clinching a silver behind the unstoppable
world record breaking Michael Phelps in the 200m butterfly.


China has a young and inexperienced team in Melbourne and Wu, the
Asian Games champion, was their best hope.


He didn't disappoint, holding off Russian Nikolay Skvortsov to
finish second in 1:55.13, three seconds behind the American star.


He said he was trying not to think too much about Phelps as he
aims for the Beijing Olympics next year.


"I'm pretty happy with it. The Doha Asian Games and the world
championships are set very close to each other, I haven't been
very well and I didn't get to train a lot," said the 19-year-old.


"I knew he'd break some records here but I never thought that
he'd break so many, which is an absolute surprise.


"I need to keep pushing and improving myself, and not think too
much about him because the athletes who finished behind me are
all very strong swimmers.


"I'll definitely be swimming in this event (in Beijing), but
there is no guarantee of a medal.


"I need to keep improving myself and need to work hard especially
on my turns and my jump starts.


"I've been training hard and I want to be able to stand on the
podium at the Olympics for a medal. I'm following my dreams, and
not doing it for anyone else."
