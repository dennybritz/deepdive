East Timor's President Xanana Gusmao said Wednesday he is ready
to become the troubled country's prime minister, after he ceases
to be head of state.


Gusmao, who will not seek re-election in East Timor's April 9
presidential election, has said he would join a newly formed
political party after the vote.


"I am ready to be prime minister," if the new party wins future
legislative polls, he said.


East Timor's current premier, Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, is
the favourite to win the presidential election.


A legislative poll is supposed to follow, but a date for it has
yet to be set.


If Ramos-Horta becomes head of state and Gusmao's party was to
win, they could end up swapping their current jobs.


The April 9 election will be the first since impoverished East
Timor declared independence in 2002, after more than two decades
of occupation by neighbouring Indonesia.
