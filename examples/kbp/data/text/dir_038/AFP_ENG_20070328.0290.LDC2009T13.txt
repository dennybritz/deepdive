The Vatican on Wednesday said it regretted a request by Israel to
postpone talks that were to lead to a long-awaited bilateral
accord.


Israel said it could not take part in the talks set for Thursday
because of "international political contingencies," the Vatican
said in a communique.


The Holy See, "while understanding the reasons" offered, "took
note with regret" and hoped a new date would be set "as soon as
possible," the statement said.


According to the religious affairs news agency I-Media, Vatican
sources suggested that the Israeli decision was in response to
the Holy See's expression of support for the new Palestinian
government which includes the Islamist group Hamas.


But Israel's ambassador to the Vatican, Oded Ben Hur, told AFP:
"That is absolutely not true," adding that Israel asked for the
postponement because of the imminent opening Wednesday of an Arab
League summit in Riyadh and the ongoing tour of the region by US
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.


Israel and the Vatican were to have held a high-level meeting
Thursday to discuss the legal and financial status of the
Catholic Church in Israel.


Negotiations on an accord that would cover Church property and
possible income tax breaks for the commercial activities of
Christian communities in Israel resumed in 2004 after a 10-year
hiatus.
