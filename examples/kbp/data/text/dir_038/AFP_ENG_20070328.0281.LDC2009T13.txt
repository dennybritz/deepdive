Britain is freezing all ties with Iran over the detention of 15
sailors and marines in the Gulf, Foreign Secretary Margaret
Beckett said Wednesday.


"We will ... be imposing a freeze on all other official bilateral
business with Iran," she said in a statement to lawmakers on the
crisis between London and Tehran.
