Finland's Kimi Raikkonen has backed a controversial plan to stage
Formula One grand prix races at night.


Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has spoken of including
night races on the F1 schedule as early as next season.


"For me it is okay as long as there is enough lighting,"
Raikkonen told reporters during testing here ahead of the April 8
Malaysian Grand Prix.


But some top drivers have opposed the plan. Citing safety
reasons, world champion Fernando Alonso has come out against
night races.


The Spaniard had recently said in Australia that he had some
experience of racing at night at the McLaren team's 2007 season
launch.


"We launched the car in Valencia at night and it was extremely
difficult to see the road," Alonso said.


"For me, it's very hard to believe that they will have strong
enough lights to see okay to have a grand prix."


But support for Ecclestone's plans seems growing after Mokhzani
Mahathir, chairman of the Sepang International Circuit (SIC),
backed night races.


"For me it makes commercial sense to host a night race. It is
cooler to race here and we think we can get more people to come
and watch at Sepang," he said.


Mokhzani said Sepang Circuit officials were already in talks with
lighting consultants on what lights could be used to make the
track bright but without glare or shadow.
