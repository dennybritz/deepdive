Air Berlin, Germany's second-biggest airline, said Wednesday it
planned to raise a total 293 million euros (391 million dollars)
from the issue of new shares and bonds to help finance its
acquisition of charter airline LTU.


Air Berlin, Europe's third-biggest low-cost carrier after Ryanair
and EasyJet, said in a statement that had placed a total 5.97
million new shares with institutional investors at a price of
16.40 euros (21.80 dollars) apiece, raising 98 million euros (131
million dollars) in all.


In addition, the airline planned to raise a further 195 million
euros via the issue of a 20-year convertible bond. With a so-
called greenshoe or over- allotment option of 25 million euros,
total proceeds from the bond could amount to as much as 220
million euros, Air Berlin said.


The combined proceeds from the share and bond issues would help
finance the acquisition of LTU, which Air Berlin had said on
Tuesday that it planned to buy for 140 million euros in cash,
plus the assumption of 190-200 million euros in net financial
debt.


The capital measures would also help refinance 100 million euros
of LTU's debt and approximately 50 million euros of Air Berlin's
existing debt, the carrier said.
