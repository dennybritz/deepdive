Retired Gurkha soldiers staged a mass protest in London on
Wednesday over Britain's refusal to give them full pensions and
other rights.


An estimated 2,500 veterans joined a rally on parliament
following recent government moves to improve conditions which
were criticised by Nepalese soldiers' groups.


"I cannot understand why in 2007 we have a situation where people
who are prepared to fight and possibly die for this country
suffer great injustice and are discriminated against so badly,"
organiser Peter Carroll told the crowd.


Earlier this month Britain bowed to pressure to improve
conditions for Nepalese Gurkha soldiers, who have served in the
British armed forces for the past two centuries.


But the decision was immediately criticised by groups
representing the famed soldiers, who said it was too restrictive,
and failed to remove barriers to their becoming British citizens.


"I am ashamed at the way that we treat our Gurkhas," said
opposition Conservative lawmaker Ann Widdecombe. "We're not
asking for charity. We're asking for justice, plain and simple
justice."


The Gurkhas are known for their fierce loyalty, bravery and
razor-sharp kukri fighting knives which they carry in battle.
