A flat thought to be the most expensive in London has been bought
by Qatar's foreign minister for 100 million pounds (147 million
euros, 196 million dollars), The Times reported Wednesday.


Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani has snapped up the
biggest penthouse in a ritzy development overlooking Hyde Park
which will not be completed for two years, the newspaper said.


The One Hyde Park block is situated opposite top department store
Harvey Nichols and features 86 apartments which are reportedly
set to sell for more than 4,000 pounds (5,950 euros, 7,800
dollars) per square foot (0.09 square metre).


Each flat in the building, designed by architect Richard Rogers,
is fitted with bullet-proof walls and windows, plus a private
lift.


Sheikh Hamad is a key investor in the project, the Financial
Times reported last month.


Property prices in the British capital have been soaring in
recent years, with the cost of luxury residences particularly
high.


According to estate agent Savills, properties valued over five
million pounds are currently enjoying 50 percent price inflation
every year.


"London continues to attract wealth from around the world and we
see no end to the strong demand for prime property," Harriet
Black, of Savills, told The Times.


The previous most expensive apartment in London sold for 27
million pounds in Chelsea, south-west London, in 2005.
