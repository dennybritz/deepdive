The wife of a Hamas militant and their two children were wounded
on Wednesday along with a passerby after gunmen opened fire on
his car in central Gaza City, medics and witnesses said.


The four victims were hospitalised, they said. The militant
himself, who was driving at the time of the attack, escaped
unscathed.


It was not immediately clear who was behind the shooting.


Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in factional fighting in
Gaza since mid- December.


But the bloodshed has largely ceased since the inauguration on
March 17 of a unity government including both the Islamist Hamas
movement of prime minister Ismail Haniya and the secular Fatah
faction of president Mahmud Abbas.
