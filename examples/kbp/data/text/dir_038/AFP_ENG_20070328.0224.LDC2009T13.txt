Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was arrested
on Wednesday in a raid at the headquarters of his Movement for
Democratic Change in Harare, a party spokesman said.


"All members of staff and Morgan Tsvangirai have been arrested,"
the party's secretary general, Tendai Biti, told AFP.


"At least 20 people were in the office at the time," Biti added.


Dozens of police had sealed off the area around the party's
offices in the upmarket 1st Street shopping mall during the raid,
according to an AFP correspondent at the scene.


The security forces were armed with teargas cannisters, sticks,
riot helmets and AK47 rifles.


Tsvangirai had been expected to brief reporters about the alleged
abduction at gunpoint on Tuesday of a senior party official after
attending a memorial service of a slain MDC activist.


Dozens of MDC activists, including Tsvangirai, were detained by
members of veteran Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's security
services and then assaulted earlier this month while trying to
stage an anti-government rally.
