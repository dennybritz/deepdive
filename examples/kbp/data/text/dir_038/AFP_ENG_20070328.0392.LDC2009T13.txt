Morocco sharply increased spending on petroleum exploration last
year compared to 2005 and registered two natural gas discoveries,
the government said Wednesday.


The country invested 520 million dirhams (47 million euros, 63
million dollars) on exploration in 2006 -- a 54 percent increase
over the previous year, the prime minister's office said in a
statement.


Two drilling projects in the northwestern region of Gharb led to
natural gas discoveries on the order of 10 million cubic metres
(13 cubic yards), the government said.


Natural gas production reached 45 million cubic metres in 2006,
compared to 26 million the year before. Sales generated 109
million dirhams, while the total was 48 million in 2005.


Morocco imports nearly all of its oil and gas from Middle Eastern
countries, as well as Algeria. Its energy bill grew by 12 percent
in 2006 to 44 billion dirhams in 2006, the government said.


The government said it signed four survey agreements and six
prospecting agreements with oil companies last year. Other
agreements were also extended.
