Three women are among 116 candidates who have registered to stand
in Sunday's municipal elections in the gas-rich Gulf state of
Qatar, an official statement carried by the state QNA news agency
said.


The elections are only the third to the emirate-wide 29-seat
council which advises the ministry of municipal affairs and
agriculture.


Only the 174,000 native citizens among Qatar's 750,000 population
will have the vote.


Women have had the franchise since the first elections in 1999.
In the second election in 2003, one woman won a seat.


The authorities have promised elections to a national assembly
but, despite indications that they would be held early this year,
no date has yet been set.
