International air travel continued to expand in February, growing
by 6.8 percent compared to the same month last year, the top
airline industry association said Wednesday.


"Passenger demand continues to exceed expectations," Giovanni
Bisignani, director general of the International Air Transport
Association (IATA), said in a statement.


Global international passenger growth a month earlier reached 6.1
percent on a year-on-year basis, and averaged 5.9 percent for the
whole of 2006.


The Middle East continued to lead the pattern of growth in
February with an 18 percent increase in passenger travel, IATA
said.


African demand was boosted by 9.4 percent, followed by Europe
(7.4 percent), North America (6.8 percent) and Asia (5.7
percent).


Global air freight slowed for the eighth month in a row however,
with a growth rate of 2.4 percent in February.
