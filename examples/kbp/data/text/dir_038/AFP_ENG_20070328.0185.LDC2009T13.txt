Arab leaders on Wednesday opened an annual two-day summit in
Riyadh which is expected to revive a dormant peace plan with
Israel.


The gathering of heads of state of the 22-member Arab League or
their representatives was opened by Sudanese President Omar al-
Beshir, who hosted the last summit in Khartoum a year ago.
