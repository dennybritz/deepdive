A woman sailor captured along with 14 other British servicemen
will be released "today or tomorrow," the CNN-Turk news channel
quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as saying
Wednesday.


"The detained British woman soldier will be freed today or
tomorrow," Mottaki told a CNN-Turk reporter at the Arab League
summit in Riyadh, the channel said.


Faye Turney, a 26-year-old married mother of a girl aged three,
is the only woman among eight Royal Navy sailors and seven
marines Britain says were on a "routine" anti-smuggling operation
in Iraqi waters when they were seized at gunpoint in the north of
the Gulf on Friday.


Tehran says they entered Iranian territorial waters illegally.


Earlier Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett
announced a freeze on all official ties with the Islamic state as
Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed to increase pressure on Tehran,
which he said faces "total isolation."


The statement came after British military officials unveiled
documentary evidence they said showed the Britons were 1.7
nautical miles (3.15 kilometres) inside Iraqi waters when they
were detained.


The Britons' detention has triggered a mounting crisis between
London and Tehran, which is already facing increasing pressure
from the West over its nuclear plans.
