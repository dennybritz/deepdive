The Czech government announced Wednesday it will launch official
negotiations with Washington over the eventual siting of a radar
station in the country as part of the extension of a US anti-
missile defence shield.


"The government has agreed to start negotiations," Prime Minister
Mirek Topolanek said in a news conference. "The Czech Republic
recognises the risks for which the anti-missile base should be
built," he added.


Washington asked Prague in January to accept a radar base for
detecting incoming missile attacks, ostensibly from such states
as Iran and North Korea, and for neighbouring Poland to host a
base for interceptor missiles.


The proposal has sparked strong criticism from Russia and split
NATO countries.
