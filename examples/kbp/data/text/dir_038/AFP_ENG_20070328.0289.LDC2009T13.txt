Legislators in Muslim-majority Indonesia signed a petition
Wednesday to seek an explanation from the government for
supporting UN sanctions against Iran, a report said.


Parlimentarian Effendy Choirie said the government's support for
the sanctions over Iran's disputed atomic programme was "a
manifestation of their fear towards the United States," the state
Antara news agency reported.


The petition, featuring 120 signatures, gives lawmakers the right
to question President Susilo Bambang Yudhyono's government.


Indonesia currently holds one of the rotating seats on the UN
Security Council, whose 15 members voted unanimously Saturday for
tougher sanctions against Iran.


Some commentators criticised Indonesia for backing the sanctions
because its stance could diminish its standing among Muslim
nations.


Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda has said Indonesia supported the
UN resolution because it promoted the goal of nuclear weapons-
free Middle East.


The sanctions block all Iranian arms exports and freeze the
overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions
linked to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.


They also restrict financial aid or loans to Tehran, and set a
fresh 60-day deadline for Iran to comply with UN demands or face
"further appropriate measures."


Iran reacted angrily, saying it would restrict its cooperation
with the UN nuclear watchdog in retaliation.
