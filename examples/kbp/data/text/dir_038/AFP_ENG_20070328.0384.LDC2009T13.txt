The International Labour Organisation said on Wednesday it will
defer a legal challenge against Myanmar over forced labour, in
the wake of a deal brokered last month that gives victims means
of redress.


The deal with the military junta promises victims "full freedom"
to submit complaints directly to an ILO liaison officer in the
country's main city of Yangon, without fear of any retaliation
from the authorities.


The ILO had previously threatened to bring its concerns about
forced labour in Myanmar before the International Court of
Justice in The Hague, but now said it would defer this move while
its officer assesses the viability of the deal.


The organisation's governing body added it was still vital that
the liaison officer had the necessary staff resources to carry
out its duties.


It called on the Myanmar authorities to "extend the necessary
cooperation and facilities" to enable this to happen.


An ILO investigation in 1998 found that forced labour was
pervasive and systematic in Myanmar, particularly with the
military, triggering a long diplomatic battle to try to stop the
practice.


Although the junta says it has banned forced labour, human rights
groups say little action has been taken, especially in areas
where foreign visitors are barred.
