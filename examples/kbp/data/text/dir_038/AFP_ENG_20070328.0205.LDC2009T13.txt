A tanker lorry caught fire in northern Nigeria following a crash,
killing more than 70 people who were scooping fuel from it,
police said Wednesday.


The accident happened in Kaduna State on Monday evening, the
police spokesman for Kaduna, Saad Yahaya, said.


"More than 70 people have been confirmed dead. There are some
survivors but we don't know exactly how many," the spokesman
said.


"The tanker turned over, the villagers came to scoop fuel and
then the tanker caught fire", he explained.


Yahaya said the tanker turned over while trying to park in the
village of Katugal, some 150 kilometres (90 miles) south of the
state capital Kaduna.


It was not immediately clear if the impact of the accident caused
fuel to leak from the tanker or whether the vehicle was
vandalized.


Road accidents with big casualty figures are common in Nigeria
where vehicles are often poorly maintained, overloaded and driven
in a reckless fashion.


In November of last year a driverlost control of his truck
outside Kaduna during gubernatorial primaries and crashed into a
crowd, crushing scores of people to death.


Almost equally common are fires where people perish whilst
scooping fuel, be it from oil company installations or trucks.


The Nigerian authorities habitually condem as greedy those who
die in such explosions.
