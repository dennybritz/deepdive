Wall Street opened to the downside Wednesday as a report showing
a modest rebound in orders for big-ticket manufactured goods
failing to ease jitters about the US economic outlook.


A jump in oil prices resulting from renewed tensions over Iran
also added to the gloom on the stock market.


In opening trades, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 38.13
points (0.31 percent) to 12,359.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed
9.31 points (0.38 percent) to 2,428.12.


The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index retreated 4.51
points (0.32 percent) to 1,424.10.


Ahead of the bell, the government reported orders for
manufactured US durable goods rebounded 2.5 percent in February.
But most of the rise came from demand for new civilian and
military aircraft.


The report "suggests investment remained soft in the first
quarter 2007," said Steven Wieting, economist at Citigroup.


Dick Green at Briefing.com said the weak report was one of
several factors weighing on Wall Street.


"The positive tone from last week continues to slip away," he
said, adding that the market was anxious about oil prices. "The
situation with Iran is a factor on oil prices and on overall
stock market sentiment."
