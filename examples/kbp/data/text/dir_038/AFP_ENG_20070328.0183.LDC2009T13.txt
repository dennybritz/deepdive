Zimbabwe security forces sealed off the area around the
headquarters of the main opposition Movement for Democratic
Change on Tuesday ahead of planned press conference by its leader
Morgan Tsvangirai.


Dozens of armed police were seen on the streets around the 1st
Street shopping mall in downtown Harare and many shops in the
area had closed with owners apparently fearful of potential
unrest, an AFP correspondent reported.


Tsvangirai had been expected to brief reporters about the alleged
abduction at gunpoint on Tuesday of a senior party official after
attending a memorial service of a slain MDC activist.


Dozens of MDC activists, including Tsvangirai, were detained by
members of veteran Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's security
services and then assaulted earlier this month while trying to
stage an anti-government rally.
