Swiss mining giant Xstrata said Wednesday it would move
cautiously in developing a nickel producing operation in
Koniambo, New Caledonia, site of one of the world's last
remaining large-scale nickel deposits.


Project manager Kevin Brown said the venture, which has yet to be
formally backed by Xstrata shareholders, demanded prudence
because several financial questions had yet to be considered.


But he said during an international nickel conference here he was
holding to 2010 as the planned production start-up date. The
company earlier this year said the operation could cost around
3.0 billion dollars (2.24 billion euros).


Xstrata acquired the Koniambo site in northern New Caledonia, a
French Pacific territory, when it absorbed Canadian group
Falconbridge in August 2006.


Brown said Xstrata was determined to control rising costs
associated with the project and to adhere to 2012-2013 as a
target period for full capacity production.


In January, Xstrata announced the start of preliminary work on
the facility at a cost of 70 million dollars, but the major
costruction phase has to get under way.


The company has a 49-percent stake in Koniambo Nickel SAS, with
the rest held by the South pacific minining group SMSP, which is
controlled by an independence movement in northern New Caledonia.


The project is considered to be intensely political, notably as a
means of preserving stability in the territory by making economic
gains available to the Kanak population.
