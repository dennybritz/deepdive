Iran on Wednesday ordered the country's Atomic Energy
Organisation to limit cooperation with the UN atomic watchdog in
response to new UN sanctions on its disputed nuclear programme.


"The decision to reduce cooperation will be effective today. The
Atomic Energy Organisation will inform the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) today," deputy government spokesman Mohammad
Paryab told AFP.


Iran had said on Sunday it would limit its cooperation and would
no longer inform the IAEA of new nuclear installations until six
months before they are brought into service


The move came after the UN Security Council imposed tougher
sanctions on Tehran for its continued refusal to freeze uranium
enrichment, a process at the centre of Western concerns it may be
seeking to build atomic weapons.
