Indonesia's defence minister said Wednesday that his Malaysian
counterpart had apologised for recent incidents related to their
joint border.


"The Malaysian defence minister has expressed his apologies to me
on the recent Ambalat incident and promised to warn his
subordinates," Defence Minister Juwono Sudarsono told reporters.


Malaysian warships and planes were reported to have crossed into
Indonesian territorial waters earlier this month near an oil
exploration area known as the Ambalat Block, off Borneo island.


The block has been a source of tension in the past. Bilateral
relations hit a low in 2005 when warships from the two sides
brushed in the area.


Another dispute over the ownership of two islands ended in
December 2002 when the International Court of Justice ruled they
belonged to Malaysia.
