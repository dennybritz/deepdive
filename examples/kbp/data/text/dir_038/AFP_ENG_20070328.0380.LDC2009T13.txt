The Italian aerospace and defence group Finmeccanica hopes to
join European plane maker Airbus soon in building the future A350
long-haul passenger jet, a senior executive said Wednesday.


Finmeccanica's unit Alenia Aeronautica wants to have a share of
between six and 10 percent in the A350 programme, its chief
executive Giovanni Bertolone told a conference call.


"(I expect) an agreement on our participation in the near
future," he added.


Alenia's role would involve the design and manufacturing of
elements made from composite materials for the fuel-efficient
plane, which is expected to compete with the soon-to-be-launched
Boeing 787.


Alena currently handles about four percent of the work on the
Airbus A380 superjumbo jet.
