The Israeli army will have to confront the strengthening of
Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip, army chief of
staff Major General Gabi Ashkenazi was quoted as saying on
Wednesday.


"The strengthening process of the terror organisations in the
Gaza Strip will have to be confronted," Ashkenazi was quoted by a
lawmaker as telling parliament's foreign affairs and defence
committee.


Israel and the Palestinians have largely abided by a Gaza
ceasefire reached last November, but Israeli officials have
repeatedly warned that they would have to respond to an alleged
increase of arms smuggling into the strip from Egypt.


According to the lawmaker, who asked to remain anonymous,
Ashkenazi also said Israel "will make sure no technology or
weapons are allowed to reach the West Bank."


The army waged a months-long operation in Gaza last year in a bid
to rescue a soldier seized by three armed groups, including the
armed wing of the Islamic movement Hamas, in a raid on an army
border post. The soldier is still being held prisoner.


The operation, which wreaked havoc on the infrastructure of the
already impoverished coastal strip, left around 400 Palestinians
and three Israeli soldiers dead.
