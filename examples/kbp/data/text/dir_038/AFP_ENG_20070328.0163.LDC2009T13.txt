Britain's growing stand-off with Iran over the detention of 15 of
its sailors and marines captured in the Gulf is "very dangerous,"
a British minister warned Wednesday.


"It's obviously a difficult, it is a delicate, and in some ways a
very dangerous situation," Home Secretary John Reid -- a former
defence secretary -- told Sky News television.


"Let's just hope we get a speedy and a satisfactory resolution to
this," he added, while reiterating London's assertion that the
military personnel were not in Iranian waters when seized last
Friday.


The comments came as British authorities were expected to unveil
documentary evidence they say proves that the sailors and
marines, including one woman, were captured in Iraqi waters.
