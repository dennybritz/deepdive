Commerzbank chief Klaus-Peter Mueller saw his salary jump to 4.5
million euros (6.0 million dollars) last year thanks to his
bank's strong performance in 2006, figures published in the
group's annual report showed Wednesday.


But even though salary represented an increase of 45 percent over
Mueller's 2005 pay cheque, the chief executive of Germany's
second-biggest bank still ranked a long way behind the head of
bigger rival Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, who was the
country's highest-paid executive last year with a salary of 13.2
million euros.


Mueller's basic salary amounted to 760,000 euros. The rest was
made up of performance-related bonuses and various stock option
programes after Commerzbank booked record net profit of 1.6
billion euros in 2006.


In all, Commerzbank's board members saw their combined salaries
rise to 23.6 million euros last year from 15.5 million euros in
2005, the annual report revealed.
