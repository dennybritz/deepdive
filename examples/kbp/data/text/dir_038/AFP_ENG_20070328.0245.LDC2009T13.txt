Saudi King Abdullah, whose country is a close US ally, on
Wednesday slammed the "illegitimate foreign occupation" of Iraq
in an opening speech to the annual Arab summit in Riyadh.


"In beloved Iraq, blood is being shed among brothers in the
shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation, and ugly
sectarianism threatens civil war," Abdullah said.
