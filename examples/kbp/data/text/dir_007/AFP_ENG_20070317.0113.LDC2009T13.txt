Israel refused on Saturday to have any contacts with the new
Palestinian government of national unity that groups secular
Fatah with the Islamist Hamas movement.


"Israel will not recognise or work with this new government or
with its members," government spokeswoman Miri Eisin told AFP.


"The new government continues along the clear line of the
preceding one. Unfortunately, there is no recognition of Israel,
there is no recognition of past accords with the Palestinian
Authority.


"And not only is there no renunciation of terrorism, there is a
clear call by the new prime minister to what he calls the right
of resistance.


"We expect the international community to firmly stick to its
demands concerning the three conditions" for lifting the aid
freeze imposed on the Palestinian government a year ago when
Hamas came to power.


The West has demanded that a Palestinian government renounce
violence and recognise Israel and past peace deals for the aid
flow to resume.


Setting out the programme of his new coalition cabinet Saturday,
prime minister designate Ismail Haniya of Hamas said it would
"respect" past accords but stressed that the Palestinians had "a
legitimate right" to "resistance in all its forms."
