The African Union Saturday called on Zimbabwe to respect human
rights and democratic principles during the political crisis
engulfing the country.


AU commission chief Alpha Oumar Konare "recalls the need for the
scrupulous respect for human rights and democratic principles in
Zimbabwe," the pan-African body said in a statement.


"He urges all concerned parties to commence a sincere and
constructive dialogue in order to resolve the problems facing
Zimbabwe."


The statement said that Konare had followed recent developments
in Zimbabwe with great concern.


Pressure has mounted on Mugabe after police last Sunday crushed
an opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) rally in
Harare and arrested its leader Morgan Tsvangirai and other
opposition activists for defying a police ban.


Police bludgeoned Tsvangirai and several of his supporters while
in custody.


There has been stiff international condemnation of the police
action which critics said was a dramatic escalation of Mugabe's
opposition crackdown.


African leaders have urged "silent diplomacy" to address the
crisis that forced the southern African nation to pull out of the
Commonwealth, despite pressure for regime change from the West.


South African Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu on Friday spoke out
against African leaders, saying they should be ashamed over the
crisis in Zimbabwe.
