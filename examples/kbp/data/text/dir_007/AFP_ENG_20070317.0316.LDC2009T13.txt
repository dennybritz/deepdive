France all but retained the Six Nations title here on Saturday as
they beat Scotland 46-19 in their final match of the tournament.


The French only scraped through to the title with an injury-time
try by Elvis Vermuelen as they need to beat the Scots by more
than 24 points to edge out the Irish, who had earlier beaten
Italy 51-24.


In theory world champions England can win the title but it would
require them beating wooden spoon favourites Wales by a margin of
57 points later Saturday.
