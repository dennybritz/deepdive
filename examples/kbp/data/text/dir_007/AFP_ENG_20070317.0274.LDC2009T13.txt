Dutch skipper Luuk van Troost told his shell-shocked side to
forget about their 221-run mauling at the hands of South Africa
and prepare to face World Cup champions Australia.


"We should clear our minds and play Australia with the same aim
of winning," said van Troost whose side take on Ricky Ponting's
Australians at the compact Warner Park ground in their latest
Group A game on Sunday.


The Netherlands conceded a host of records to South Africa here
on Friday.


Herschelle Gibbs became the first man to hit six sixes in an
international over, Mark Boucher hit the fastest ever World Cup
fifty off 21 balls while South Africa smashed a total of 18
sixes, another record.


It was the third heaviest World Cup defeat in history.


"I don't want any more world records against my team. It was not
a good sight to see world records made against us, not at all
enjoyable," said van Troost.


"We didn't enjoy what happened against South Africa. We were
outplayed and although we had a good start to the match we threw
that away with some poor bowling."


"Now we need to do the basics right against Australia and if we
bowl well and field with discipline we can be a better side."


The Netherlands play their last match against Scotland on March
22.
