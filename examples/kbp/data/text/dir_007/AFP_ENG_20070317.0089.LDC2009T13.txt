A stateless man of Romanian origin, who had been living in a
transit centre at Bucharest's international airport after being
expelled from Germany, killed himself Saturday morning, border
police said.


"An inquiry has been launched to determine the circumstances of
the incident," police said.


Marin Mogos, his wife and their three children gave up their
Romanian citizenship in 1993 and settled in Germany.


German authorities refused to grant them asylum in 2002 and
expelled them back to Romania but the family refused to enter
Romanian territory and set up residence at Bucharest airport's
transit centre for immigrants.


Mogos later sued the Romanian state in the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg, claiming he had been subject to "bad
treatment" and condemning what he called "violations of the right
to free movement."


The European Court dismissed the suit, ruling that the family's
rights had not been violated.


According to the Romanian media, Mogos and one of his daughters
had already attempted suicide in the past.
