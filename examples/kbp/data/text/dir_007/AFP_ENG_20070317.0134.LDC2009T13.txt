France international fly-half Frederic Michalak has been fined
300 euros for slapping a photographer in February 2006 while
playing for Toulouse in a French Top 14 match at Pau.


Michalak, who was not present at the Pau court, also had to pay
the symbolic compensation of one euro to the photographer, Bruno
Poumirou, who had taken legal action against the player.


Poumirou had been trying to play a joke on the Toulouse players
in front of their changing rooms by showing a photograph taken a
year earlier with Michalak trying to make a phone call with a
shoe, alluding to a reputation of bad behaviour by the Toulouse
team.
