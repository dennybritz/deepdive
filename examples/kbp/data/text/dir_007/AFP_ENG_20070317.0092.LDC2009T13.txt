Palestinian prime minister designate Ismail Haniya called on the
West Saturday to end a crippling aid freeze as he presented a new
coalition government aimed at meeting Western concerns.


"We are expecting them to take concrete measures to lift the
embargo imposed on our people and to put pressure on the
(Israeli) occupation authorities to do the same," Haniya told
MPs.


He appealed by name to China, the European Union, Japan, Latin
American countries and Russia.


He also urged the US administration to "review its position on
the Palestinian cause" and respect the "choice of the Palestinian
people embodied in the (new) national unity government."


The European Union and the United States imposed a freeze on
direct aid to the Palestinian Authority last March when a
government dominated by Haniya's Islamist Hamas movement took
power.
