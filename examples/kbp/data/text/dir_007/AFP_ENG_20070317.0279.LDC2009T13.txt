Eurostar was to resume a full train service at 4:30 pm (1630 GMT)
on Saturday, almost 24 hours after a trackside fire in London
left tens of thousands of passengers stranded on both sides of
the Channel, the company said in a statement.


Eurostar added that full services between London, Brussels and
Paris were restarting after British fire authorities allowed
railway lines near the scene of the blaze to reopen.


Trains earlier left Brussels and Paris, timed to arrive in London
with the expected lifting of the closure.
