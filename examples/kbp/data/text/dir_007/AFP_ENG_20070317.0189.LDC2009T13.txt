A bomb exploded near a Canadian convoy in southern Afghanistan
Saturday, killing a child and wounding three members of his
family and a NATO soldier, officials said.


Afghan police said the blast was caused by a suicide bomb but
NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said only a
vehicle parked at the side of a road had exploded near the convoy
in the southern province of Kandahar.


The Afghans wounded in the bombing on the main highway in the
restive province included two children, a police officer at the
scene said. They and the dead boy were all from the same family,
said the officer, Ghulam Hazrat.


ISAF said the children and adult were severely hurt and evacuated
to one of the alliance's medical facilities.


"One ISAF soldier suffered minor injuries," it said in a
statement.


The Canadian military, which has 2,500 troops mainly in Kandahar
province, said separately that it had been involved.


The road, known as Highway One, is the main link between western
Afghanistan and Kandahar. It has seen several attacks in the past
months, including suicide bombings by Taliban insurgents.


The rebels were blamed for most of nearly 140 suicide bombings
last year, which killed hundreds of people most of them
civilians. They have vowed more this year.
