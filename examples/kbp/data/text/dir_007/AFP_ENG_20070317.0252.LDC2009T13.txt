Ethiopia called for international help on Saturday in obtaining
the release of eight Ethiopians still missing after five
Europeans captured with them were released last week.


"The international community should assist us in this problem,"
Information Minister Berhane Hailu said in a statement sent to
AFP on Saturday, adding: "We have serious concerns about them."


There has been no news of the Ethiopian captives since the
release in Eritrea last Tuesday of a five-strong British embassy
tour group abducted at the same time in the northeast Ethiopian
desert on March 1.


On Friday, Ethiopia again alleged that its neighbour, Eritrea,
was involved in the abductions. Asmara has strongly denied this.


Britain's foreign office and the former captives have not
publicly blamed any group for the kidnappings in remote territory
close to Ethiopia's border with Eritrea.


In a statement after their release the group expressed concern
for the eight Ethiopians. Five other Ethiopians taken at the same
time were freed three days after the abduction.
