The United Nations mission in Afghanistan on Saturday added to
appeals for the release of an Italian journalist and two Afghans
kidnapped two weeks ago by Taliban who have threatened to kill
them.


The mission was "greatly concerned" by the detention of
journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo and the others, spokesman Adrian
Edwards said.


The UN "calls upon those holding him to take this opportunity to
show their humanity by immediately releasing him along with his
detained Afghan colleagues," Edwards said in a statement.


A Taliban spokesman has told AFP that Monday evening is the
deadline for its demands to be met, including a date for the
withdrawal of Italian troops and the release of two Taliban
spokesmen being held by authorities.


The Taliban initially said the Italian and his colleagues had
been spying for military forces in Afghanistan.


The UN statement said Mastrogiacomo was a well-known journalist
and we "know of no reason whatsoever for him to be under anyone's
suspicion."


"In Afghanistan, as elsewhere, journalists have a job to find and
report on the truth. We ask that the rights of journalists to go
about their work free from interference or harm be recognised and
respected by all," Edwards said.


Mastrogiacomo's newspaper and various media groups have also
appealed for the Italian's release, stressing he is an
established reporter who has covered events around the world.
