France led Scotland 20-14 at half-time here at the Stade de
France on Saturday in their final Six Nations match.


France need to beat the Scots by 24 points to retain the title
after fellow contenders Ireland thrashed Italy 51-24 earlier on
Saturday.


World champions England have an outside chance of claiming the
championship but would need to beat wooden spoon favourites Wales
by a margin of 52 points to win it.
