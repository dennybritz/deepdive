A Eurostar train was scheduled to leave Brussels for London at
2:59 p.m. (1359 GMT) Saturday, resuming a service interrupted by
a fire in the British capital the day before, Belgian railways
said.


Tens of thousands of passengers in London, Brussels and Paris
were affected by the cancellation of the high-speed trains
through the Channel tunnel after a trackside fire near Waterloo
station threatened to explode gas cylinders.


Services were due to resume at the British end at 1700 GMT, some
24 hours after they were halted.
