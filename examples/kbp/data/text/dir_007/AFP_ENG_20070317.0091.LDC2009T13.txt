North Korea has begun preparations to shutdown and seal its key
Yongbyon nuclear reactor, South Korea's top nuclear envoy said
Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency.


Pyongyang was also willing to start moving towards disabling its
nuclear facilities but its actions would depend on how soon it
will be rewarded, Chun Yung-woo said.


"North Korea said it has begun preparations to shut down the
Yongbyon nuclear facilities. It said it will disable the
facilities as soon as conditions are met," the envoy said.
