Manchester United captain Gary Neville will miss England's Euro
2008 qualifiers against Israel and Andorra after suffering ankle
ligament damage that will keep him out for three weeks.


Neville limped out of United's 4-1 win over Bolton on Saturday
when he turned an ankle in a first half tackle with Gary Speed.


The right-back will not be fit in time to play for England in
Israel next Saturday or for their clash with Andorra on
Wednesday.


United boss Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed: "It is ligament damage
and he will be out for three weeks. It is a blow, there's no
question about that."
