China's central bank announced Saturday that one-year borrowing
and lending benchmark rates would be raised by 0.27 percentage
points from Sunday to rein in the economy.


In a statement on its Internet site, the People's Bank of China
said the interest rate on one-year loans would increase to 6.39
percent.


The expected announcement comes as the authorities acknowledge
that growth in credit and liquidity are again gathering pace and
also after data showed inflation was approaching the 3.0 percent
threshold they set, with a consumer price index rise of 2.7
percent in February.
