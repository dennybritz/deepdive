The central rate for the Slovak koruna within the European
exchange rate mechanism has been adjusted following its 10
percent strengthening against the euro last year, effective
Saturday.


One euro is now equivalent to 35.4424 koruna, the European
Central Bank said in a statement on Friday, up from the 38.4550
koruna level set when Slovakia became part of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism II (ERM II) in November 2005.


The revaluation is justified by underlying fundamentals and will
support the authorities in maintaining macroeconomic stability,
the ECB said.


The exchange rate mechanism is designed to reduce exchange rate
volatility for countries ahead of a possible adoption of the
euro. Alongside Slovakia it also includes Cyprus, Denmark,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta.


Currencies are allowed to fluctuate within a 15 percent range of
their central rate.
