England's new 800-million pound (1.45 billion-dollar) stadium has
finally opened its doors to the public for the first time as a
precursor to the FA Cup final in May, the BBC reported on
Saturday.


About 60,000 Londoners were allowed into the 90,000-capacity
national arena in order to test turnstiles and escalators as part
of the safety certificate application.


A football session will take place on the pitch and visitors will
be asked to collectively flush the stadium toilets.


The ground was due to re-open in August 2005 but a series of
hold-ups cancelled music and sports events.


Members of an England fan club have also been invited to
Saturday's "community day", which will feature music and dancers
from the local area.
