Bayern Munich general manager Uli Hoeness said Saturday a heated
exchange between a UEFA doctor and Oliver Kahn and Lucio had
taken place during doping tests prior to their Champions League
match on March 7.


European football's governing body on Friday opened disciplinary
proceedings against Kahn and Lucio, accusing the pair of
"improper behaviour" during the tests.


"The doctor in charge of testing complained about the players'
attitude, but they did undergo the urine tests," said Hoeness
before Bayern's Bundesliga match against Eintracht Frankfurt on
Saturday.


"But the doctor complained that he was not present when they gave
their urine samples. It was at that point that there were
animated exchanges between them."


UEFA's disciplinary committee will examine the case on March 22.


Bayern went on to beat Real Madrid 2-1 to qualify for the
quarter-finals of the Champions League.
