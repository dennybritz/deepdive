A Palestinian coalition government uniting the rival Hamas and
Fatah factions officially took power on Saturday at simultaneous
swearing in ceremonies in Gaza City and the West Bank city of
Ramallah.


The twenty-five ministers in the incoming cabinet placed their
hands on the Koran, and in the case of the one Christian minister
on the New Testament, and swore allegiance to the Palestinian
people in front of president Mahmud Abbas.


The new unity government is due to hold its first cabinet meeting
on Sunday in Gaza City, with West Bank ministers participating
via video link because of Israeli travel bans.
