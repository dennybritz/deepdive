Asian superpowers India and Pakistan were in desperate trouble at
the World Cup on Saturday.


Pakistan slumped to 25-2 after five overs against the part-timers
of Irelamd at Kingston while India were 51-3 after 17 overs
against Bangladesh in Port of Spain.


Pakistan, who lost their opening match of the tournament to the
West Indies, were put into bat by Ireland skipper Trent Johnston
and saw opener Mohammad Hafeez dismissed off the final ball of
the first over for four.


Star batsman Younis Khan was then caught by Andre Botha off Boyd
Rankin for nought in the fourth over.


At Port of Spain, India were put in to bat and were in trouble
losing Virender Sehwag for two, Robin Uthappa for 10 with
Mashrafe Mortaza taking both wickets.


Slow left arm bowler Abdur Razzak then had Sachin Tendulkar
caught behind by Mushfiqur Rahim for seven.
