Jamie Lyon scored two tries on his National Rugby League debut
for Manly in the Sea Eagles' 32-6 trouncing of Canberra at
Brookvale Oval Saturday.


The Sea Eagles scored six tries to one to outclass the wooden-
spoon favourites.


The former St Helens' pivot Lyon scored in the 32nd-minute off a
grubber kick by scrum-half Matt Orford and his second try came
off a high cross-field bomb which Raiders winger Colin Best
fumbled to allow him to touch down.


Cronulla brought an end to their club record 10-game losing
streak, securing an 18-0 opening round win over Penrith at Shark
Park.


Fullback Brett Kearney was the hero for the home side with two
tries, the Ricky Stuart coaching era at the club kicking off in
style as the Sharks held Penrith scoreless for the first time
since 1999.


It was Cronulla's first win since round 16 last year when they
defeated Newcastle 26-16.


It was the first time since 1999 that the Panthers have been
scoreless, Souths beating them 20-0 in round 18 on that occasion.
