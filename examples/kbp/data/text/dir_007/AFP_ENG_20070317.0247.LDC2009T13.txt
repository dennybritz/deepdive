Former US Open champion Kim Clijsters said Saturday she will skip
Roland Garros this year to enable her to prepare for her upcoming
marriage with American basketball player Brian Lynch.


The world number five Belgian is in her final season as a
professional tennis player and had previously been rumoured to be
considering missing the French Open to concentrate on Wimbledon a
month later.


However, she told her official internet site that it is her
upcoming nuptials that will prevent her playing on the red clay
of Paris from May 28.


"I'm dropping out of Roland Garros because that week I'm going to
the United States to prepare my marriage party," said Clijsters.


The 23-year-old, a former French Open finalist, will be married
on July 14, shortly after Wimbledon finishes.


"July 14, is a big day: our wedding in Bree (north of Belgium).
Ten days later we're organising a party in the United States and
then we will leave on our honeymoon.


"I have yet to decide on the US Open but one thing is for sure,
I'll play at Luxembourg and Stuttgart (end of September and
beginning of October). I've always loved those two tournaments."


Clijsters was a former world number one in singles and doubles at
the same time and made her debut on the WTA tour in 1999.
