A suicide bomber slammed an explosives-filled car into a Canadian
convoy in southern Afghanistan Saturday, killing a child and
wounding a NATO soldier and three Afghans, officials said.


The Afghans wounded in the bombing on the main highway in the
restive province of Kandahar included two children, a police
officer at the scene said.


They and the dead child were all from the same family, said the
officer, Ghulam Hazrat.


The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force confirmed
the incident in the troubled Zhari area just west of Kandahar
city. "There was one ISAF casualty. He was wounded," the ISAF
media office in Kabul told AFP.


The interior ministry said the attack was a suicide car bombing
but ISAF could not confirm this.


The Canadian military, which has 2,500 troops mainly in Kandahar
province, said separately that it had been involved. It could not
immediately give details, including on casualties.


The road, known as Highway One, is the main link between western
Afghanistan and Kandahar. It has seen several attacks in the past
months, including suicide bombings by Taliban insurgents.


The rebels were blamed for most of nearly 140 suicide bombings
last year, which killed hundreds of people most of them
civilians. They have vowed more this year.
