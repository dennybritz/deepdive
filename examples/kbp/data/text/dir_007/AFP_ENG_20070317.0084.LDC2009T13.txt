Palestinian prime minister designate Ismail Haniya said
"resistance in all its forms" is a "legitimate right" in a speech
to MPs Saturday setting out the programme of his new government.


"The government affirms that resistance in all its forms to the
occupation is a legitimate right guaranteed by international
resolutions. It is therefore the right of our people to defend
itself in the face of continuing Israeli aggression," Haniya told
parliament.


He added nonetheless that his government would seek to
"consolidate and broaden" a fragile truce with Israel in force in
the Gaza Strip since November, but said it should be
"comprehensive and reciprocal".
