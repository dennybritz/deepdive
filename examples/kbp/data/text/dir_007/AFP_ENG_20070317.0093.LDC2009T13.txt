North Korea has begun preparations to shutdown and seal its key
Yongbyon nuclear reactor, South Korea's top nuclear envoy said
Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency.


Pyongyang was also willing to start moving towards disabling its
nuclear facilities but its actions would depend on how soon it
will be rewarded, Chun Yung-woo told reporters in Beijing.


"North Korea said it has begun preparations to shut down the
Yongbyon nuclear facilities. It said it will disable the
facilities as soon as conditions are met," the envoy said.


Under a February 13 accord, Pyongyang promised to begin shutting
down its nuclear programme within two months in exchange for
energy aid and diplomatic concessions.


A follow-up round of disarmament negotiations, which group the
two Koreas, China, the United States, Russia and Japan, begins in
Beijing on Monday.
