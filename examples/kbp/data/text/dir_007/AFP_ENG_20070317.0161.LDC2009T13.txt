At least 16 people were killed and 67 injured Saturday in eastern
India when their bus slid into a ditch after it tried to avoid an
oncoming vehicle, police said.


"The bus packed with labourers and office-goers rolled into a
roadside ditch after it tried to avoid a police vehicle," West
Bengal state police chief Raj Kanojia told AFP.


Sixteen bodies had been recovered from the ditch, he said, and
the 67 injured have been taken to hospital.


"The death toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured
is critical," Kanojia added.


The passenger bus was traveling on a narrow village road near
Purulia town, about 320 kilometres (200 miles) west of the state
capital Kolkata.


A protest had erupted among locals at the scene who were angry
over the accident, the police chief said.


They "smashed a police vehicle when it reached the scene," said
Kanojia.
