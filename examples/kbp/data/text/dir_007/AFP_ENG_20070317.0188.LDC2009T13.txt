A breakaway group of Maoists killed a former rebel activist after
abducting him from his home in southeast Nepal, police said
Saturday.


Supporters of theJanatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (Goit) or Terai
People's Liberation Front "shot dead a local Maoist activist in
Sisuriya village" on Friday, said police inspector Laxman Giri.


He was speaking from Siraha district where the killing took place
which lies 350 kilometres (220 miles) southeast of the nation's
capital Kathmandu.


Giri, who said the victim had been kidnapped earlier on Friday,
said the reason for the killing was not known. He had no further
details.


The group broke away from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)
two years ago and has been spearheading an anti-Maoist movement
in the southern plains bordering India known as the Terai.


It says the Maoists do not represent the "true voice of the Terai
people."


The group intensified its violence in the Terai region after the
Maoists ended a decade-long insurgency that claimed at least
13,000 lives.


It has demanded that the Terai region become an independent state
and has rejected plans for elections for a constituent assembly
to draft a new constitution for the Himalayan nation.


It says the election will only serve to undermine the aspirations
of people of the Terai region.
