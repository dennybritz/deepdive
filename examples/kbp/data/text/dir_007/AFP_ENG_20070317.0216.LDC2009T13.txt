Who's saying what at the World Cup:


"What can you say? I told Daan after the third ball, 'try to bowl
a quicker one' and he said, 'I just did'. There were a few good
balls in it and a few shit ones."


- Dutch captain Luuk van Troost on Daan Van Bunge's over which
saw South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs hit his historic six
successive sixes.


"It's up there with the best things I've done. I never thought
about getting six in a row, but if it's your day, it's your day."


- Gibbs


"It doesn't actually surprise me that much. Gibbs's was a fairly
rare feat but having played out there the other day it's a pretty
small ground and it could have happened, not easily, but the way
some of the players are hitting the ball these days it doesn't
surprise me at all."


- Australia skipper Ricky Ponting giving a cautious response to
Gibbs's achievement.


"We should not let ourselves down. That's really important. We
have to go out there and do our best. If we do that, I think the
hopes of a billion people will be satisfied."


- India skipper Rahul Dravid on the burden of expectation facing
his team.


"All the boys are really shocked and upset. Some of them also
cried because he was very close to us."


- Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar on the shock felt at the
death of international teammate Manjarul Islam who was killed in
a road accident near Dhaka.
