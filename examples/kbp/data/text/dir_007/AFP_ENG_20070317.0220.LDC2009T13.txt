Bulgaria's Stilian Petrov announced he was returning to the
national football team and would play in the Euro 2008 qualifier
against Albania on March 28, national television reported
Saturday.


The Aston Villa midfielder and Bulgaria captain walked out on the
squad last October following a lacklustre 1-0 win over Luxembourg
in a Euro 2008 qualifier and disagreements with head coach Hristo
Stoichkov.


"It was a difficult decision... But we agreed that the national
team is more important than Stilian Petrov or Hristo Stoichkov,"
Petrov said. "We both made big compromises."


The 27-year-old player, who has scored seven goals in 66
appearances for his country and has captained the national side
since April 2003, said he would be travelling to Bulgaria on
Monday and play in the qualifier against Albania on March 28.
