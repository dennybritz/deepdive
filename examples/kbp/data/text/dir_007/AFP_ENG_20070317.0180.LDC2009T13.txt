More than 10,000 teachers, schoolchildren and parents took to the
streets of the Polish capital on Saturday calling for the
resignation of Roman Giertych, the country's far-right education
minister.


The protestors, who travelled to Warsaw from all over the
country, made their way past Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski's
residence to parliament via the ministry of education in the
centre of the city.


Giertych, leader of the far-right League of Polish Families
(LPR), wants greater emphasis in classrooms on Polish patriotism,
national values and the state's authority.


Gay rights groups also took part in the march in protest at
homophobic comments made by the minister.


Giertych's deputy Miroslaw Orzechowski on Saturday attacked the
communist roots of the ZNP union which organised the rally and
said that from now on potential school directors would have to
disassociate themselves from it.
