Former French international Robert Pires has finally recovered
from a knee injury and was named in Villarreal's squad to face
Real Sociedad on Sunday, the club announced here on Saturday.


Pires, 33, tore the cruciate ligament in his left knee in a pre-
season friendly and he has yet to play in La Liga for Villarreal.


The 1998 World Cup winner moved to Spain last summer after six
seasons at English Premiership side Arsenal.
