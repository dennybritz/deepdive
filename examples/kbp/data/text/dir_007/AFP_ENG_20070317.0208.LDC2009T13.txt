A sudden pullout of US troops from Iraq would aggravate the
situation there, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in remarks
published on Saturday.


"A sudden (US) withdrawal, before having implanted the factors
that will achieve stability and security and end the violence,
would cause a dangerous worsening of the situation in Iraq," he
said in comments to the government weekly Akhbar al-Yom.


Washington is under growing domestic pressure to pull out its
troops, and thousands of people were expected to converge on the
centre of the US capital on Saturday and march on the Pentagon in
protest against the Iraq war.


More than 3,200 US troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis
have been killed since the March invasion four years ago, and
recent polls show that most Americans now want the government to
set a timetable for a withdrawal.


"Egypt is holding contacts with the international community with
the aim of ending the communal schism (between Shiites and
Sunnis) among the Iraqi people," Mubarak added.
