Austria's Nicole Hosp had  a double success at the World Cup
finals here on Saturday, claiming victory in the women's slalom
and taking top spot in the overall standings.


Hosp deposed compatriot Marlies Schild, who finished 18th,
following her race win in 1min 45.67sec, 0,28sec ahead of
Sweden's Anja Paerson and 1.35sec in front of Slovakia's Veronika
Zuzolova.


With just one race to go, a giant slalom at Lenzerheide on
Sunday, reigning world champion in the discipline Hosp has a
30-point lead from Schild.


Hosp has now ramped up the pressure on Schild, the clear queen of
the slalom this season with seven World Cup victories out of
eight. Schild made two major errors on the second run to put her
out of contention.
