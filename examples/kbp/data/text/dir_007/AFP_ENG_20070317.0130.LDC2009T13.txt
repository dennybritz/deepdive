Military planes on Saturday flew over northern Thailand to dump
water in an effort to contain haze, which has affected some five
million people for the past two weeks, an official said.


Two aircraft dropped water in the northern tourist hotspot of
Chiang Mai where air quality still remained at a level considered
unhealthy due to the haze caused by slash-and-burn farming and
wildfires in the region and parts of neighboring Laos and
Myanmar.


Army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, who visited the
haze-hit region this week, ordered the military to dispatch
planes to ease environmental and health effects of the haze, said
an air force spokesman.


"Initially, our operation covers only Chiang Mai, but we will
assess the situation and may expand (water spraying operations)
to other haze-hit provinces," said Group Captain Monthol
Suchookorn.


Apart from Chiang Mai, the haze has blanketed seven northern
provinces and the public health ministry said it affected the
health of 1.5 million residents, mostly suffering eye irritation
and sore throats.


The public health ministry has distributed some 600,000 surgical
masks and enlisted thousands of volunteers to distribute them and
offer advice about possible respiratory problems.


The ministry also has handed out 400,000 booklets on how to cope
with haze.
