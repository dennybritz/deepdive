North Korea said Saturday it has begun preparations to shut down
its nuclear facilities, indicating it was honouring its
disarmament obligations, according to US envoy Christopher Hill.


The top US nuclear negotiator said the North Koreans issued a
statement saying they were readying steps to shutdown their
nuclear facilities.


"I think they referred to starting the preparations," he told
reporters. "I don't think they have started to shut down the
facilities."


The North Korean statement, made during working group discussions
ahead of full six-party talks starting Monday, was "very balanced
and constructive and indicated that they are under way and
fulfilling their obligations," he said.


Under a February 13 accord, Pyongyang promised to begin shutting
down its nuclear programme within two months in exchange for
energy aid and diplomatic concessions.


South Korean top nuclear envoy Chun Yung-woo also said Saturday
that North Korea has stated it was begun preparations to shut and
seal its facilities, including its key Yongbyon atomic reactor,
the Yonhap news agency reported.


Hill said the next round of six-nations talks starting Monday was
scheduled for two days, and would bring together the two Koreas,
China, the United States, Russia and Japan.
