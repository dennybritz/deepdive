English supporters groups claim the German football league is an
example where standing areas can be included in grounds safely,
the BBC reported on Saturday.


Standing sections were been banned in England's top two divisions
following the inquiry into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when,
during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, 95 Liverpool fans died
after supporters were crushed behind safety fencing.


However in the Bundesliga, about 10 percent of tickets are
obliged to be for standings areas and a German stadium specialist
Gunter Pilz told the BBC: "We have never had safety problems with
standing in Germany."


English supporters groups the Football Supporters' Federation and
Stand Up Sit Down have been voicing their desire to look into the
possibility of re- establishing some standing sections.
