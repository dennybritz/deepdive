A 40-year-old North Korean woman and her teenage daughter have
been arrested in northern Thailand for illegal entry, police said
Saturday.


The pair were arrested Friday in Chiang Rai province, 785
kilometers (490 miles) north of Bangkok, after failing to present
ID documents to a police officer, they said.


They told police through an interpreter that they had fled North
Korea in search of a better life and entered Thailand via China
and Myanmar, they said.


Chronic food and energy shortages have driven a growing number of
North Koreans from their impoverished homeland, and many of them
have been arriving at Thailand's northern border after crossing
through China, Laos and Myanmar.


The number of North Koreans arrested for illegal entry into
Thailand in 2006 surged to more than 400 from 50 in 2005.
