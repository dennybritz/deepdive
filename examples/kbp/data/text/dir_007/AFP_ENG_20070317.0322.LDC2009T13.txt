Germany's foreign minister said Saturday that the project to
create a U.S. anti- missile shield could lead to a new arms race
in Europe.


Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier made the comments in an
editorial to be published Sunday in the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung newspaper.


"Our biggest priority remains disarmament, and not re-armament,"
he said. "We do not want a new arms race in Europe."


He called on the Russian and U.S. governments to avoid the "old
reflexes" of the Cold War, and said Europe and NATO should remain
united in the debate on the anti-missile shield.


Steinmeir said discussions on the anti-missile project would "put
(U.S.) willingness for sincere cooperation to the test."


A U.S. project to install 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a
radar in the Czech Republic has been harshly criticised by
Russia.


Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov said Saturday that the
project would have "negative repercussions" on relations between
Russia and NATO.


Some aspects of the anti-missile system are already in place in
Britain and Greenland.
