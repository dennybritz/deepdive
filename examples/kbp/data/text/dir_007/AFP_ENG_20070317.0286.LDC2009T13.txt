FIFA has ordered Kenya to adopt an 18-team national football
premier league starting in the 2007 season with a further
reduction to 16 teams in 2008, officials said on Saturday.


The directive was issued by a FIFA delegation visiting the
country to set up a roadmap for the immediate relaunch of Kenyan
football following the lifting last week of a five-month
suspension from international football.


"This is not basketball. This is football and football rules have
to be followed," said FIFA's head of development department
Pascal Torres, who led the delegation.


"Those who don't want to follow FIFA rules should quit now
because we have decided it is 18 clubs for 2007 and 16 clubs for
the 2008 season," Torres said.


The decision signals a death knell for Kenya's oldest club, AFC
Leopards, which has been fighting behind the scenes to survive in
the premier league despite being relegated to the lower division
last season.


Political manoeuvring and boardroom decisions have long kept
these politically- connected clubs to remain in the premiership
despite their woeful performances and unsound financial
standings.
