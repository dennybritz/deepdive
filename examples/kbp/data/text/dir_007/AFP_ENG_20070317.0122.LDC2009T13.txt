Bombers detonated explosives on three trucks carrying a toxic gas
amid traffic in western Iraq, killing at least two police and
leaving 350 civilians needing treatment, the US military said
Saturday.


All three attacks were carried out between 4.11 pm (1311 GMT) and
7.13 pm on Friday, two of them just south of the town of Fallujah
and one northeast of the nearby city of Ramadi, both hotbeds of
Al-Qaeda militants, a statement said.
