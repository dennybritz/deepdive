Palestinian prime minister designate Ismail Haniya said Saturday
his new government would work towards a prisoner exchange with
Israel including a soldier captured by Gaza militants last June.


"The government will work, and encourage the parties concerned to
work, to speed up the resolution of the problem of the captive
Israeli soldier within the framework of a prisoner exchange
agreement," Haniya told MPs as he set out his new coalition
government's programme.


The military wing of Haniya's Islamist Hamas movement was one of
three organizations that claimed responsibility for the capture
of Corporal Gilad Shalit in a deadly cross-border raid from Gaza
on June 25.
