Finland's Hannu Manninen won the World Cup nordic combined title
for the fourth season running after the penultimate event of the
season was cancelled here on Saturday.


Windy weather caused a delay to the intial start time but the
conditions persisted leaving the organisers no option but to
cancel.


The final round takes place in Oslo on Sunday, but Manninen, now
119 points ahead of Norway's Magnus Moan in the overall
standings, cannot be caught.


"I am very proud of this title," said Manninen, "Even if I would
have preferred to win it after today's competition."


Manninen twice won this season, compared to winning 13 times last
winter, but was crowned world champion for the first ever time
this year in the 15km event in Sapporo, Japan, last month.


He has 763 World Cup points in the bag to lead from Moan (644)
and Austria's Christoph Bieler (643) while Jason Lamy-Chappuis is
fourth (596).
