Sweden's Social Democrats, who have dominated the country's
postwar politics but have been in opposition since a crushing
election defeat in September, on Saturday elected their first
woman leader at a party congress.


Mona Sahlin, 50, was elected in a vote seen as a formality, as
she was the sole candidate nominated for the leadership by an
electoral committee.


She takes over from Goeran Persson, the former prime minister who
had led the party since 1996 and who was ousted by a centre-right
coalition headed by Fredrik Reinfeldt in September's election.


Sahlin's election also sets the scene for her to become Sweden's
first woman prime minister if she leads the party to a comeback
in the next legislative elections in 2010.
