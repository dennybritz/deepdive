A Chinese company has been banned from selling plots of land on
the moon, state media reported on Saturday.


The company, Lunar Embassy to China, had sold a total of 49 acres
(20 hectares) to 34 customers before authorities acted, Xinhua
news agency said.


An appeal court on Friday upheld an earlier ruling against the
Beijing-based firm which had been selling the lunar plots.


In 2005 the company had its business licence revoked and was
fined 50,000 yuan (6,450 dollars) by commerce authorities. It
sued but the court ruled against the firm.


On Friday, the Beijing intermediate court rejected its appeal,
saying no individual or country could claim ownership of the
moon.


The company had reportedly lunar land at a less than astronomical
price of 298 yuan an acre, Xinhua news agency said.


China is planning to launch its first lunar probe this year and
hopes to have the ability to land a man on the moon within 15
years.


China became the third nation to place a man in space, after the
former Soviet Union and the United States, when Yang Liwei
piloted the Shenzhou V on a short mission in October 2003.


Two years later, the Shenzhou VI carried two astronauts into
space on a five-day mission.
