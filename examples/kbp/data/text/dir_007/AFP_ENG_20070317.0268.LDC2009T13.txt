Norway said on Saturday it would normalise ties with the
Palestinian government after the creation of coalition government
uniting Hamas and Fatah.


"The unity government's programme takes important steps toward
meeting the demands set by the international community. On this
basis, Norway will therefore resume political and economic
relations with the Palestinian government," Foreign Minister
Jonas Gahr Stoere said in a statement.


The Palestinian parliament on Saturday voted in favour of the
landmark unity cabinet, which it is hoped will end a turbulent
year of factional bloodshed and an international boycott.


The international community frozen aid to the Palestinians after
Hamas swept to power in elections in March 2006. As a condition
to resume aid, it has demanded that Hamas renounces violence,
recognises Israel and honours past peace accords.
