A Eurostar train left Brussels for London at 2:59 p.m. (1359 GMT)
Saturday, resuming a service interrupted by a fire in the British
capital the day before, Belgian railways said.


"Eurostar 9141 left Brussels on time," a railway official told
AFP, adding that full service from the station had been resumed.


Tens of thousands of passengers in London, Brussels and Paris
were affected by the cancellation of the high-speed trains
through the Channel tunnel after a trackside fire near Waterloo
station threatened to explode gas cylinders.


Services were due to resume at the British end at 1700 GMT, some
24 hours after they were halted.
