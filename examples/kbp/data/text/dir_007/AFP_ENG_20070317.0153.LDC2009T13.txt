Unstoppable Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal claimed his third
victory in a row when he won the men's giant slalom to secure the
World Cup crown in the discipline here on Saturday.


Italian Massimiliano Blardone finished second while American Bode
Miller finished in third place.


Svindal, the newly-crowned downhill and giant slalom world
champion, has set up a mouthwatering finish to the season on
Sunday by regaining the overall World Cup lead ahead of Austrian
Benjamin Raich, who failed to finish.


The final men's race of the season is a slalom on Sunday, and
Raich is a specialist in the technical discipline.


However with 100 points on offer for each victory, Austria's
double Olympic champion will have to win and hope for Svindal to
crash out if he is to have any chance of defending his overall
crown.


If Raich wins the slalom, Svindal, who leads the World Cup with
1252 points ahead of Raich, who has 1155, needs only to finish in
15th place to secure the crown.


Ahead of claiming what would be his first World Cup crystal
globe, arguably the sport's biggest prize, Svindal admitted he
would have to stay focused.


"Today was an important day for me, but tomorrow will be even
more so," said Svindal, who has now claimed five victories this
season as well as two world titles.


"After the first run I told myself to use my head. I was really
tempted to go a bit harder on my skis but I didn't want to risk
too much."


Svindal also won the super-G and the downhill earlier this week.
