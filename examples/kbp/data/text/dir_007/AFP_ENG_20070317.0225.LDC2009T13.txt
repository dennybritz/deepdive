The Palestinian parliament on Saturday overwhelmingly approved a
coalition government uniting the radical Islamist Hamas movement
with the secular Fatah of president Mahmud Abbas.


Eighty-three members of the 132-member parliament voted in favour
of the landmark unity cabinet, and three lawmakers voted against.
Forty-one MPs are in Israeli prisons and another four were not
present for the vote.


The newly approved ministers will take the constitutional oath in
Gaza City and in Ramallah at 6 pm (1600 GMT), and are expected to
hold their first cabinet meeting on Sunday.


Prime minister Ismail Haniya of Hamas has said that ending a
crippling aid freeze and restoring law and order to Palestinian
streets will top the new government's list of priorities.


This is the 11th Palestinian government since the formation of
the Palestinian Authority in 1994, and the first to include both
the Islamist Hamas movement and Abbas's secular Fatah party.
