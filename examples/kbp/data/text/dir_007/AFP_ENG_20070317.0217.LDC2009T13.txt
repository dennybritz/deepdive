The Palestinian parliament on Saturday overwhelmingly approved a
coalition government uniting the radical Islamist Hamas movement
with the secular Fatah of president Mahmud Abbas.


Eighty-three members of the 132-member parliament voted in favour
of the landmark unity cabinet, and three lawmakers voted against.
Forty-one MPs are in Israeli prisons and another four were not
present for the vote.
