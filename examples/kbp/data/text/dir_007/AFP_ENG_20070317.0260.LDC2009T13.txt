Insurgents shot dead a US soldier on Saturday in the restive
Iraqi city of Baquba, north of Baghdad, the military said.


The soldier was killed during operations in Baquba, the
provincial capital of Diyala, where attacks on coalition forces
have surged in the past few months.


On Friday, the US military commander in Diyala, Colonel David W.
Sutherland, said indirect fire attacks against his troops rose to
98 in February 2007 from 28 in July and direct fire attacks
jumped to 153 from 90.


The latest death brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,212, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
