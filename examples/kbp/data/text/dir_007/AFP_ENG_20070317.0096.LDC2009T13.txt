The African Union Saturday called on Zimbabwe to respect human
rights and democratic principles during the political crisis
engulfing the country.


AU commission chief Alpha Oumar Konare "recalls the need for the
scrupulous respect for human rights and democratic principles in
Zimbabwe," the pan-African body said in a statement.


"He urges all concerned parties to commence a sincere and
constructive dialogue in order to resolve the problems facing
Zimbabwe."
