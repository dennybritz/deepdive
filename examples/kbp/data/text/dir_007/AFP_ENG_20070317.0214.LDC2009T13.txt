Christian Bimes will remain as president of the French tennis
federation, the FFT said in a statement on Saturday, although he
was placed under judicial investigation last month for abuse of
position.


An FFT committee voted by 33 out of 36, with three abstentions,
to keep Bimes in his post. "The president (...) will continue to
do his job which was granted him by our general assembly," the
FFT said.
