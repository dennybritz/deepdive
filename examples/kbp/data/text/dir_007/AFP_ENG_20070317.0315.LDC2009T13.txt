Wigan and Fulham played out a dire 0-0 draw in the English
Premiership at the JJB Stadium on Saturday but neither manager
will be too disappointed.


The point gained by each side edges them a little further away
from the relegation zone with matches running out for the bottom
three to save themselves.


The hosts started the game eight points clear of the drop zone
with their visitors a point further ahead.


Wigan boss Paul Jewell may feel his side should have taken the
three points in a game devoid of any imagination and short on
chances as substitute forward Henri Camara missed an open goal in
the second half when it looked easier to score.


The first 45-minutes were so bad there was only a single shot on
goal. And although the second was slightly less mundane, it still
provided little for the crowd to get excited about.


But with Wigan now nine-points clear of Charlton, in 18th place
in the league, Jewell and his Fulham counterpart Chris Coleman,
whose side are now 10 clear, will both be feeling a little more
comfortable about their teams' chances of escaping the dreaded
drop.
