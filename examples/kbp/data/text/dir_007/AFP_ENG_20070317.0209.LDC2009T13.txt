Morocco has sent two envoys to China to explain the government's
proposals for self rule of the disputed Western Sahara region,
the official MAP news agency reported on Saturday.


The two, Taieb Fassi Fihri, an official at the ministry of
foreign affairs, and Mohamed Yassine Mansouri, head of military
intelligence, carried  a special message from King Mohammed VI to
China's President Hu Jintao, the agency said.


It said the pair, who will spend Friday and Saturday in China,
were to explain how Morocco's initiative was aimed at finding a
"peaceful solution to the question of (Western Sahara) within a
United Nations context".


Last month, Morocco's Prime Minister Driss Jettou unveiled the
first draft of a plan to grant the territory self-rule but under
Rabat's continued sovereignty.


The plan, which was rejected by the Western Sahara's separatist
Polisario Front, is expected to be presented to the United
Nations in April.


Morocco annexed the desolate but phosphate-rich northwest African
territory after the withdrawal of the region's former colonial
power Spain and neighbour Mauritania in the 1970s.


A war ensued with the armed Polisario Front independence movement
which was set up in 1973 and established itself as the sole
representative of the nomadic Saharan or Saharawi people.


The conflict ended in 1991 with a UN-brokered ceasefire.


Since then, the United Nations has tried several times to
organise a referendum on self-determination for the territory.
All, including one in 2003 by former US Secretary of State James
Baker, broke down over arguments over who was eligible to vote.
