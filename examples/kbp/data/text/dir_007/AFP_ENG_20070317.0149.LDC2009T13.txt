Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal won the men's giant slalom to secure
the World Cup crown in the discipline here on Saturday.


Italian Massimiliano Blardone finished second while American Bode
Miller finished in third place.


Svindal, the newly-crowned downhill and giant slalom world
champion, thus gained the overall World Cup lead ahead of
Austrian Benjamin Raich, who failed to finish.


The final men's race of the season is on Sunday, and Raich is a
specialist in the technical discipline.


However with 100 points on offer for each victory, the double
Olympic champion will have to win and hope for Svindal to crash
out if he is to have any chance of defending his overall crown.


Svindal currently leads the World Cup with 1252 points, while
Raich sits in second place on 1155.
