A Yemeni appeal court on Saturday said it would give its verdict
on April 22 in the case of 23 nationals sentenced earlier to jail
for trying to get to Iraq to joint the insurgency there.


Most of the accused were arrested in Syria before being able to
reach Iraq, and were each sentenced last June to three years and
four months in prison.


They were found guilty by a lower court of falsifying documents
to enable them to get to Iraq, possession of arms and helping
suspects of the Al-Qaeda terror network to hide.
