French tennis prodigy Aravane Rezai and her father-coach Arsalan
have been banned from Roland Garros for two years following
allegations of violent behaviour towards the French Fed Cup
captain.


The 20-year-old has been told she can not use the facilities at
the home of the French Open throughout the year but can still
compete in the second Grand Slam of the year, which starts on May
28.


Her father, though, is banned from not only the venue but also
all tournaments organised by the French Tennis Federation.


Rezai, ranked 50 in the world, had a breakthrough year last
season, reaching the last 16 at the US Open and the third round
at Roland Garros.


She caught the imagination of the French media because of her
Iranian Muslim roots but her father has also hit almost as many
headlines for his behaviour.


He faced serious allegations from France's Fed Cup captain
Georges Goven, with whom he had a violent altercation in
February.


French sports newspaper L'Equipe reported, citing several
sources, that Arsalan Rezai had aggressively, verbally attacked
Goven at Roland Garros.


The FFT called a meeting with Rezai and her parents to resolve
the dispute and Arsalan retracted his accusations and apologised
for his behaviour.


Arsalan has been in hot water before after threatening the father
of a rival French tennis player in the juniors in 2004.


He was fined 500 euros for that and Rezai was banned from playing
in French tournaments for a year.
