Atletico Madrid's Spanish international striker Fernando Torres
has no intention of moving to the English Premiership, the player
told Spanish radio station City FM on Saturday.


Last season, Torres was reported to be frustrated at Atletico's
lack of success in securing a place in Europe - he has never
played in the Champions League or UEFA Cup - and looking for a
move.


English giants Manchester United and Liverpool have been linked
with the 23 -year-old who already has 40 Spanish caps despite his
relative youth.


The rumours about the Atletico icon leaving have persisted this
season but he appeared to pour cold water on that idea on
Saturday.


"I'm not thinking about leaving Atletico," said Torres.


"My future doesn't depend solely on results. I want to be where I
am most loved and if we make it into Europe than I couldn't get
anything more at any other club, I'll have everything I want at
home," he added.


Torres has been at Atletico his entire career and made his first
team debut at the age of 16, when the club was in the Spanish
second division.


He has a contract with Atletico until the summer of 2008.


Atletico are in sixth place in the Spanish first division and on
course for qualifying for Europe next season, eight years after
their last contintinenal excursion.
