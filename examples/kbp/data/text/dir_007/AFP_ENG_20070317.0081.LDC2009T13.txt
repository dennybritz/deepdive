Prime minister designate Ismail Haniya called for a Palestinian
state in the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 Saturday but
made no reference to the Jewish state as he presented a new
government to MPs.


"The government will work with the international community to put
an end to the occupation and recover the legitimate rights of our
people, foremost among them the creation of an independent state
enjoying full sovereignty in the territories occupied in 1967,"
Haniya said.


He said that the new unity cabinet, which includes both his
Islamist Hamas group and the secular Fatah faction of president
Mahmud Abbas, would "respect the resolutions of international
legitimacy and the agreements signed by the Palestine Liberation
Organization."


The Hamas charter calls for the destruction of the state of
Israel but the movement's leaders have said they are ready to
accept a state in the occupied territories in exchange for a
long-term truce with Israel that falls short of recognition.


Haniya also called for recognition of the right of return of
Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Middle East war "in conformity
with Resolution 194" of the UN General Assembly, which is
rejected by Israel.
