Australian Prime Minister John Howard came to Iraq on Saturday on
an unannounced visit to meet Australian soldiers and his Iraqi
counterpart Nuri al-Maliki, an Australian defence spokesman said.


Howard met some of the 1,450 Australian troops serving in Iraq
near Baghdad airport shortly after his arrival before coming into
the war-torn city for talks with Prime Minister Maliki, the
official told reporters.


The two leaders were expected to hold a joint press conference,
after which Howard plans to leave Iraq, he added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
