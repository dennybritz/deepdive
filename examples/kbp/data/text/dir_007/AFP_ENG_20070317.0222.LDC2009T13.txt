Wayne Rooney and Park Ji-Sung grabbed two goals each as
Manchester United made light of their striker shortage by beating
Bolton 4-1 to edge closer to their first Premiership title since
2003.


The win at Old Trafford extended United's lead at the top of the
table to nine points ahead of champions Chelsea's home clash with
Sheffield United later in the day.


Korean midfielder Park scored two close-range efforts either side
of Rooney's superbly-taken opener as United killed the lunchtime
contest in the space of 11 first-half minutes.


Rooney, United's only fully fit forward, added his second with
another brilliant finish quarter of an hour from the end, after
being sent clear of the Bolton back four by substitute Alan
Smith, who was making his first Premiership appearance since
breaking a leg and dislocating an ankle in February 2006.


A late Gary Speed penalty enabled Bolton to avoid a repeat of the
4-0 defeat they suffered at home to United earlier in the season.


But it was nevertheless an impressive display from United, with
Cristiano Ronaldo again outstanding.


The Portuguese winger created his side's first three goals before
making for Smith, underlining why he is the favourite to win
England's player of the year awards and why Barcelona and Real
Madrid are desperate to prise him away from Old Trafford.
