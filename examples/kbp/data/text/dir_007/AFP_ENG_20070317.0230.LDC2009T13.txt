Queen Sonja of Norway on Saturday attended the opening of a major
new exhibition of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch at the Beyeler
Foundation museum in the northwestern Swiss city of Basel.


The exhibition of around 130 paintings and 80 other works is the
largest ever to be held outside Munch's native Norway.


Notably absent however was the Symbolist painter's most famous
work, "The Scream," which was seriously damaged after being
stolen in an audacious daylight raid on an Oslo gallery in August
2004.


"The Scream" and "Madonna," another painting stolen in the same
raid, are still being exmained by museum experts to see if they
can ever again be put on display.
