Hong Kong share prices finished the Monday morning session 0.53
percent higher, supported by buying activity linked to the expiry
of March futures contracts later this week, dealers said.


They said Wall Street's significant gains last week helped
sentiment, while property stocks were lifted by news of strong
apartment sales over the weekend.


The Hang Seng Index ended the morning up 104.06 points at
19,796.70, off a low of 19,653.73 and a high of 19,819.04.
