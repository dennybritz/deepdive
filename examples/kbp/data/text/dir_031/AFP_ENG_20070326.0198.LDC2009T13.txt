Intellectual property rights infringement and counterfeiting in
China have led the country to be "one of the problems" of global
piracy, a top US executive said Monday.


"China is one of the problems," Thomas Donohue, president of the
US Chamber of Commerce, told reporters at a briefing held one day
before the Global Forum on Intellectual Property Rights
Protection and Innovation in Beijing.


"China is a problem, because it's such a big country," he added.


"It's going to take efforts of governments at all levels around
the globe," he said, adding countries like India, Russia, Mexico,
South Korea and Brazil are also sources of concern for IPR
abuses.


The two-day forum, which is seen as a joint effort to crack down
on global copyright theft, will bring together more than 500
business leaders and officials from Europe, Japan, the United
States, Singapore, India and China.
