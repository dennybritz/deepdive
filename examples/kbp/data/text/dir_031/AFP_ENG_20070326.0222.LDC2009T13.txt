Arab foreign ministers decided on Monday to create working groups
to initiate contact with all players in the Middle East peace
process, Jordan's foreign minister told AFP.


"The Arab foreign ministers approved the Arab peace plan without
amendment and in its initial form," Abdel Ilah Khatib said.


"It was decided to set up several working groups to initiate
contacts with all parties concerned by the peace process," which
would include Israel, the minister said.


The Arab plan for peace with Israel was first adopted in 2002 and
endorsed again by the ministers at their meeting in the Saudi
capital ahead of an annual Arab summit which opens on Wednesday.
