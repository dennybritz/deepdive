German power giant E.ON raised its offer for Spanish electricity
supplier Endesa on Monday to 40 euros (53 dollars) per share or
42.3 billion euros in all, extending the offer period until April
3.


Previously, the German group had been offering to buy Endesa for
38.75 euros per share or 41 billion euros in all.


In addition, E.ON said it would "exercise all legal options
against the action taken by Enel and Acciona," which had
announced on Friday that they would examine the possibility of
launching a joint bid for Endesa.
