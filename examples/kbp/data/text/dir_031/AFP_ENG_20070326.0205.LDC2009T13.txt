Spanish construction group Acciona and Italian energy giant Enel
said on Monday they would launch a joint bid for Spanish utility
Endesa, in a clear signal of a bidding war aimed at rival German
suitor E.ON


Acciona and Enel said their bid would be at least one euro a
share higher than an improved offer by E.ON on Monday.


The counter attck by Acciona and Enel, which also said they would
form a joint holding company to manage Endesa, would value the
Spanish electricity supplier at 43.4 billion euros (57.6 billion
dollars).


The two groups said their offer would not be less than 41 euros a
share.


The joint bid is aimed at thwarting a drive by E.ON, which
earlier on Monday raised its offer for Endesa to 40 euros a share
from 38.75.


But complicating the procedure is a decision, announced on Friday
by the Spanish stock market regulator, that the Spanish and
Italian companies would have to wait six months from March 29,
when E.ON's previous bid was to expire, before making their move
on Endesa.


The price of shares in Endesa was showing a rise of 5.8 percent
to 40.9 euros, and shares in Acciona rose by 0.89 percent to
164.5 euros when trading in the shares was resumed.
