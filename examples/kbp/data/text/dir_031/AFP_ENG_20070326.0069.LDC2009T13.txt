The US-administered Northern Mariana Islands said it will
investigate the deaths of four South Korean exchange students who
drowned when a wave swept a group of hikers into the sea.


Two men and two women aged between 18 and 24 died when a large
wave struck a group of 17 hikers in the remote Forbidden Island
area in eastern Saipan on Friday.


Seven of the students were swept into the sea. Three survived the
ordeal but three bodies were recovered later Friday and another
on Saturday.


A government spokesman said an investigation would be held into
the incident to ensure it did not happen again.


One of the surviviors was recovering in hospital Monday while
others received only minor injuries.


The Forbidden Island conservation area is popular with tourists
for snorkelling in natural pools and a cavern in the cliffs.
