NATO warplanes called in by the Afghan army bombed and killed 19
militants in southern Afghanistan, taking the toll from a four-
day operation to 99, the defence ministry said Monday.


The 19 were killed in the southern province of Helmand on Sunday,
it said in a statement.


The Afghan army launched the sweep of the Gereshk area of the
province on Thursday, the second day of the Afghan new year.


Operation Nawrozi (New Year) is the first large operation
launched by Afghan forces with NATO air support but not ground
troops.
