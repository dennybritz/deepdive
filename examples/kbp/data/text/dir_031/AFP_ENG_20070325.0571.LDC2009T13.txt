The South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers will hold talks
this weekend on the southern Korean resort island of Jeju,
foreign ministry officials said Monday.


Foreign Minister Taro Aso will visit for talks with his South
Korean counterpart Song Min-Soon, said ministry spokesman Ryoo
Joohan, adding details had yet to be fixed.


Song and Aso held their first talks in Tokyo last December.


This week's meeting comes after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe stirred anger by saying there was no evidence that Tokyo had
coerced Asian women into sex slavery during World War II.


Abe has since tried to cool down the row, saying he "sincerely"
stood by the previous Tokyo government's 1993 apology for wartime
sex slavery.


South Korea and Japan are also part of the six-nation nuclear
disarmament talks on North Korea. Tokyo has usually taken a
tougher line on Pyongyang.
