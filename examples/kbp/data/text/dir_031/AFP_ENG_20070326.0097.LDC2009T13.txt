French right-wing presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy stood
down as interior minister Monday to concentrate on his campaign,
and was replaced in a mini- government reshuffle by Overseas
Territories Minister Francois Baroin.


Health Minister Xavier Bertrand, who is Sarkozy's campaign
spokesman, also resigned and was replaced by Social Security
Minister Philippe Bas.


The appointments were made public in a statement from the Elysee
palace.


Baroin, 41, is a long-time ally of President Jacques Chirac and
acted as his campaign spokesman in 1995. He waited until Chirac's
decision two weeks ago not to stand for a third term before
declaring his support for Sarkozy in next month's election.


A former journalist, Baroin was the youngest member of parliament
when he was elected in 1993.
