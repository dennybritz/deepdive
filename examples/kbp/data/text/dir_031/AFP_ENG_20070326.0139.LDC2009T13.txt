New York Yankees slugger Hideki Matsui voiced concern Monday
after his hometown in rural Japan was hit by a deadly earthquake.


"I am concerned. I hope there will be as little damage as
possible," the 32 -year-old outfielder told Japanese reporters in
Lakeland, Florida after hitting 1-for-3 in a 9-5 pre-season loss
to the Detriot Tigers.


"It was hard at first to get my call through to my home. They
turned out to be alright," Matsui said.


The 6.9-magnitude quake, followed by dozens of aftershocks, has
left one person dead and nearly 200 injured in the Noto peninsula
and its vicinity, some 300 kilometres (200 miles) northwest of
Tokyo.


Matsui's hometown, Nomi, is located at the neck of the peninsula.
His father Masao, 64, runs a museum displaying some 1,000 items
of the baseball star's memorabilia.


"I was surprised to learn about it when I got a call from my
associate in Japan. We rarely hear about big earthquakes there,"
said Matsui, now in his fifth season with the Bronx club.


There were about 300 visitors at the two-year-old museum when the
tremor struck in mid-morning Sunday, the senior Matsui told the
Sports Nippon daily.


"It shook awfully. But we were fortunate that none of the guests
were injured," he said. "Glass showcases were not shattered at
all."
