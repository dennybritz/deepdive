Arab foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh on Monday to prepare an
Arab summit renewed their endorsement of an Arab plan for peace
with Israel "as is and without amendment," one minister told AFP.


"The Arab peace plan was discussed first and was approved by the
ministers, in its initial form and without amendment," the
minister said.


The plan will be referred to the heads of state on Wednesday for
adoption along with other resolutions, he said.
