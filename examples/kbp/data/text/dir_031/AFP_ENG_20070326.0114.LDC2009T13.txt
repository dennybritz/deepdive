Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Monday that a Saudi-
sponsored deal which led to the formation of a Palestinian unity
government has increased the chances of Arab support for a plan
for peace with Israel.


"Arab efforts and the Mecca agreement increase the chances of
reaching a solid Arab position in support of the Arab peace
initiative," Prince Saud al-Faisal told foreign ministers meeting
in Riyadh ahead of an Arab summit.


He was referring to an accord reached in the Muslim holy city of
Mecca last month between the radical Islamist movement Hamas and
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party which led to the
formation of the cabinet last week.


The Saudi-inspired Arab plan -- adopted in Beirut in 2002 --
proposes full normalisation of relations with Israel if it fully
withdraws from all the land it occupied in 1967, permits the
creation of an independent Palestinian state and allows the
return of Palestinian refugees.
