A rumbling Indonesian volcano could erupt in the next two weeks,
experts warned Monday after 15,000 people fled their coastal
homes nearby.


The alert status for the increasingly active Mount Batutara had
been raised to the third of four possible levels, volcanologist
Soerono said in a statement, meaning an eruption could occur in
the next fortnight.


Some 15,000 people living on an island near the volcano have left
their homes, fearing an eruption could cause a tsunami, although
experts have discounted the risk.


"More residents in coastal areas in the Lembata district have
taken refuge to higher ground, even though the volcanology agency
says there is no threat of a tsunami," local official Anderias
Nula Liliweri said.


The volcano, which sits on a normally deserted island in the
Flores sea, began rumbling and smoking last week.


Fishermen who occasionally land there have been told to stay at
least two kilometres (1.2 miles) away.


Indonesia sits on the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire", where
continental plates meet, causing frequent volcanic and seismic
activity.
