Northern Ireland's rival party leaders Ian Paisley and Gerry
Adams met Monday for the first time ever, in a last-ditch bid to
agree on restoring self-rule in the province, a parliamentary
official said.


Paisley, of the Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, and Adams,
of Catholic foes Sinn Fein, were to discuss a DUP proposal to
extend a midnight Monday (2300 GMT) power-sharing deadline by six
weeks.
