Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, under fire for his remarks on
World War II sex slaves, on Monday apologised again to so-called
"comfort women," saying he stood by a landmark 1993 statement.


Abe, questioned in parliament by a leftist lawmaker on whether he
would apologise to comfort women, said he was ready to do so.


"I am apologising now as the prime minister," Abe said, his
spokesman Hiroshi Suzuki told AFP.


"This has been stated in the Kono statement," Abe said.


In 1993, a statement by then chief government spokesman Yohei
Kono apologised to former comfort women and acknowledged that
Japan was involved directly or indirectly in causing their
suffering.


Abe earlier this month triggered an uproar when he said there was
no evidence that Japan directly coerced comfort women. He later
elaborated by saying he was talking of coercion in the "strict"
sense of kidnapping women.
