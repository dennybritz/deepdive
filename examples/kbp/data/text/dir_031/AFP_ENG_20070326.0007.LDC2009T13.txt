Insurgents in Iraq killed five US troops in two separate roadside
bomb attacks, the military reported Monday.


Four soldiers were killed Sunday when a roadside bomb exploded
near their patrol in the restive Diyala province, north of
Baghdad.


Two other soldiers were also wounded in the attack.


Insurgents have stepped up attacks on US troops in Baghdad's
neighbouring regions, especially Diyala, since a massive security
clampdown was launched in the capital last month to quell the
sectarian violence.


Another soldier died when a similar roadside bomb exploded near
him as he was conducting a routine clearing operation in a
northwestern district of Baghdad on Sunday, the military said in
a separate statement.


The attack left another two soldiers wounded.


The latest casualties brought the military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,234, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
