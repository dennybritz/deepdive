Northern Ireland's rival parties have agreed a delayed date for
self-rule in the British-run province, a party source told AFP on
Monday, shortly before a first- ever meeting between their
leaders.


The agreement was reached in discussions between deputy leaders
of Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists (DUP), whose leaders
Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley were expected to meet shortly, said a
senior source familiar with the talks.


The source did not disclose the date given.


Paisley's party called at the weekend for a six-week delay in
power-sharing, ahead of a deadline at midnight (2300 GMT) Monday
set by Britain and Ireland for an accord on restoring self-rule
to Belfast five years after it was suspended in 2002.
