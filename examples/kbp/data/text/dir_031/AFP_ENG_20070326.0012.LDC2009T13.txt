Bangladesh marked its 36th independence day Monday under
emergency rule and tight security amid fears of bomb attacks in
protest over the impending execution of six Islamic militants.


Security was tight across the country with thousands of police
and soldiers deployed at checkpoints in the capital Dhaka after
reports that a banned Islamic militant group may launch attacks.


"We have had reports of a threat by JMB (Jamayetul Mujahideen
Bangladesh) and so to avoid any incident we have deployed 5,500
police in Dhaka city to strengthen security," Dhaka police
commissioner Naim Ahmed told AFP.


Hundreds more police were guarding key installations such as
power plants, he said.


Six JMB leaders are due to be hanged by April 19 for their part
in the killing of two judges in November 2005.


The six are also blamed for masterminding a string of deadly bomb
attacks as part of a campaign to have strict Islamic law imposed
in the Muslim-majority but secular country of 144 million people.


At least 28 people died in the bombings which began on August 17,
2005, when more than 400 small bombs exploded almost
simultaneously across the country.


Bangladesh has been under emergency rule since January, when
president Iajuddin Ahmed stepped down as head of the caretaker
government and cancelled disputed elections.


Bangladesh was part of India until the 1947 division of the
subcontinent between Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan.


It won independence from what was then known as West Pakistan in
1971 after a bloody, nine-month war.
