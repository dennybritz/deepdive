Ground personnel and flight attendants for Air Senegal
International began a two-day strike Monday over pay issues, the
union said, bringing all flights from Dakar to a halt.


"Following the failure of negotiations, we have launched a strike
for today (Monday) and tomorrow (Tuesday)," union leader
Moustapha Diakhate told AFP..


He said the union is seeking a new salary scale and the
integration of about 100 temporary workers.


The airline's pilots are not participating in the strike, he
added.


"There were supposed to be a lot of (Air Senegal) flights today
but they have all been cancelled because of the strike," an
airport information source told AFP.


"The (airline) management is making no statement for the moment,"
said company spokesman Matar Diop.


Air Senegal, started in 2001, is 51 percent owned by Royal Air
Maroc and the remainder by the Senegalese government.
