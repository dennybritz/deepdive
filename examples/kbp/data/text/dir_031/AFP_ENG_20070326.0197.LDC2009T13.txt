Northern Ireland's rival party leaders Ian Paisley and Gerry
Adams agreed Monday to restore self-rule in Belfast on May 8,
according to a draft statement seen by AFP.


The statement, due to be read out by Sinn Fein leader Adams after
his first-ever talks with Paisley, talks of "acceptance... that
Ian Paisley has given an unequivocal and firm commitment to
devolution on May 8."
