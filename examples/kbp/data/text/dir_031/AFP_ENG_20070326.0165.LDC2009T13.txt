French business leaders are feeling better about prospects this
month than they did in February, with the level of their
confidence at its highest since April 2006, the INSEE statistics
body said Monday.


INSEE said its measure of business sentiment had risen to 109
this month from 108 in February and 106 in January.


"Despite the difficulties experienced by the automobile sector,
industry leaders remain upbeat," said analyst Alexander Law with
the research group Xerfi.


The INSEE index showed that managers foresaw an improved pace of
manufacturing production in the months ahead, with domestic order
books at healthy levels.


"After a nine-month recession, industrial activity appears at
last to be rebounding," noted Marc Touati of the ACDE think tank.


But he cautioned that foreign orders weakened in March.


"The recent appreciation of the euro and the slowdown in global
growth have begun to have negative effects on French exports," he
said. The stronger euro makes French products marketed abroad
more expensive and less competitive than goods from the United
States or Asia.


Touati also warned that uncertainty over global economic
prospects could dampen hiring in France.


"The French manufacturing sector was likely to continue to
destroy jobs in the coming quarters, at least at home," he said.


He added that French firms were more likely to create jobs "where
demand is strong and where tax and regulatory pressures are
limited -- overseas."
