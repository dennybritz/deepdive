Chinese share prices rose 1.13 percent in the morning session
Monday, pushing further into record territory on sustained
follow-through interest, with telecom and tourism stocks gaining
ground, dealers said.


They said the market continued to be supported by hopes for solid
corporate earnings and a strong yuan.


"The upward trend is likely to be maintained as investors expect
no more major negative news to emerge in the near future after
the interest rate hike announced one week ago," said Zhu Haibin,
an analyst at Everbright Securities.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, ended the morning up 34.67 points at 3,108.95, just off
an all-time high of 3,109.82.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 36.52 points or 1.13 percent at
3,266.79 and the Shenzhen A-share Index rose 12.65 points or 1.48
percent at 865.81, another record high.
