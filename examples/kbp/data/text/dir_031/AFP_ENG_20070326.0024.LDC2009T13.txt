Egyptians headed to polling stations for a  referendum on Monday
on constitutional changes which the regime says promotes
democracy but which the opposition charges limits political
freedoms.


The amendments have drawn rare US criticism and prompted calls by
the opposition to boycott the referendum, which opened at 0600
GMT with 36 million people registered to vote.
