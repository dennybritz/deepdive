Six Portuguese rugby players spent a night in jail in Uruguay
over the weekend after their World Cup qualifying celebrations
got out of hand, the president of Portugal's rugby association
said on Monday.


"The competition is very demanding, they had a free night and
unfortunately they went out drinking, that was it," Didio de
Aguiar told state-run radio RDP.


The six unnamed players were not charged and are scheduled to
return to Portugal on Tuesday, he added.


Police in Uruguay said a police officer was struck during a clash
with the players on Saturday night in Montevideo's historic
centre.


The remaining members of the rugby team were cheered as they
arrived back in Lisbon early on Monday after they became the
first Portuguese side to qualify for the Rugby World Cup finals.


Portugal lost its match to Uruguay 18-12 but still filled the
20th and last berth for the World Cup on aggregate points. They
are in Pool C with New Zealand, Scotland, Italy and Romania.
