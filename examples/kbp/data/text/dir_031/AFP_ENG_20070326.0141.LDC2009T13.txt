Northern Ireland's rival leaders Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams were
scheduled to meet around 11:a.m. (1000 GMT) on Monday, in what
could provide a breakthrough to secure a self-rule deal, a source
told AFP.


"If the meeting goes ahead, that signals agreement on a date for
devolution and on the importance of the work that will go
forward," the source told AFP, on condition of anonymity.


On Saturday Paisley's Democratic Unionists (DUP), who favour
remaining part of Britain, agreed to form an executive with
Adams' Sinn Fein -- but they want to delay devolution by six
weeks, until May, to overcome outstanding hurdles.


The Northern Ireland Assembly, created by the 1998 Good Friday
peace agreement, has been suspended since October 2002, and
Monday is the deadline for a deal to restore self-rule in
Belfast.
