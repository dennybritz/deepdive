Pakistani Taliban militants clashed with police Monday after
trying to enter a high school in a northwestern town, leaving one
policeman and one insurgent dead, officials said.


The extremists tried to enter the Oxford Public School in Tank --
a town on the edge of the semi-autonomous South Waziristan tribal
region -- to recruit students, the local administration chief
said.


"They wanted to go inside in a bid to convince the students to
join them for jihad (holy war). Police knew their designs and
stopped them," Tank administration chief Syed Mohsin Shah told
AFP by telephone.


"In an exchange of fire the officer in charge of the local police
station, Hasan Khan, was killed. One extremist was killed and
another was wounded," he said. "They were all local Taliban."


Another official said another three policemen had been wounded
when the militants threw a hand grenade.


Residents said security agencies sealed off the area after the
clash and an investigation was underway.


Militants have recently torched video shops and televisions and
banned barbers from shaving beards in northwestern Pakistan and
the tribal areas, fuelling concern about the "Talibanisation" of
the already conservative area.


Pakistan has been waging a difficult campaign to drive out
thousands of Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants who fled Afghanistan
after the US-led invasion sparked by the September 11, 2001
attacks on the United States.
