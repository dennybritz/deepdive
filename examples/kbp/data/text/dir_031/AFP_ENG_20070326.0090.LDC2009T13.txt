Japan's Fuji Television said Monday that it had filed a lawsuit
against Livedoor Co. over a bruising takeover battle that made it
a reluctant investor in the scandal-hit Internet firm.


The television network is seeking about 34.5 billion yen (292
million dollars) to compensate for its losses after seeing the
value of its shares in Livedoor plummet after the two firms
formed an alliance two years ago.


Fuji Television said in a statement that it had decided to file
the suit after Livedoor failed to meet its demands for
compensation.


The network reluctantly bought 12.75 percent of Livedoor's shares
for 44 billion yen in a humiliating truce in 2005 after a two-
month takeover battle.


Shares in the once high-flying Internet portal plunged last year
as prosecutors built a criminal case against the company and its
top executives for falsifying its earnings.


Livedoor was eventually delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.


Last year, Fuji sold its Livedoor shares to another Internet
firm, Usen, for 9.5 billion yen, taking a loss of 34.5 billion
yen.


Fuji Television filed the suit after the Tokyo District Court
last week found Livedoor as a company guilty of fraud and
sentenced its once-brash founder Takafumi Horie to two and a half
years in jail.
