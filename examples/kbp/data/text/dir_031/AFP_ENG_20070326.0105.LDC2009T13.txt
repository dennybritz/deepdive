Tempers frayed in the England dresing room after the
disappointing 0-0 Euro2088 draw with Israel on Saturday, British
press reports said Monday, with manager Steve McClaren and star
striker Wayne Rooney involved in a row.


The Manchester United forward was said to have stormed out of the
dressing room after being singled out for criticism by McClaren,
whose team have now failed to score in four of their last five
matches.


Rooney has failed to score a competitive goal for England since
Euro 2004 and McClaren is reported to have told the 21-year-old
that he has not played well for his country for three years.


The player reportedly responded by throwing his boots and kit at
the wall in frustration and it is reported the argument was so
loud it could be heard in the Israel dressing room next door.


Rooney endured a frustrating evening, failing to impose his
talent on the game and being yellow carded after a spat with
Israeli defender Tal Ben Haim.
