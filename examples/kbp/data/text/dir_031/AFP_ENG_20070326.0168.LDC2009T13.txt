The United States supports recommendations made by the UN envoy
to give surpervised independence to the Serbian province of
Kosovo, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said Monday.


"We are going to issue today a declaration that says we fully
support Martti Ahtisaari's proposal," he said. "The US does
support the proposal by Ahtisaari to offer independence under
supervision."
