Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell has resumed production at its 187,000
barrels per day facility in southern Nigeria that was shut down
early this month because of a spill, a spokesman said Monday.


"We have reopened the 10 flowstations affected by the spill at
the Nembe Creek Trunk Line," Bisi Ojediran told AFP.


"Production is ramping up to pre-shut-in levels," he said, adding
that optimal production would soon be attained.


The spill at Nembe Creek on March 4 led to an output loss of
187,000 barrels per day. Ten flowstations were closed to enable
the company to effect necessary repairs.


The cause of the spill is still unknown.


Shell, which accounts for around half of Nigeria's daily output
of some 2.6 million barrels, was already losing some 477,000
barrels per day because of the unrest in the Niger Delta.


Since Janaury 2006, separatist groups seeking a larger share of
Nigeria's oil wealth have stepped up their capaign of violence
against oil companies, their personnel and related business
interests in the region.


In a separate development, the Nigerian government has sued Shell
and three other companies for violation of nuclear safety and
radiation law by allegedly dumping radioactive substances in
southern Delta State.


Court officials said Shell and three other defendants were
accused of transporting radioactive substances from Port Harcourt
in Rivers State to Warri without the necessary authorizations.


Ojediran confirmed the suit, but declined to comment.


"We don't want to comment on a suit before a court," he said.


No date has been fixed for the hearing.
