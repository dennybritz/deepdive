The end-of-year Club World Cup will now involve a play-off
between a team from Oceania and the host nation, this year Japan,
to decide which lines up in the six-team continental competition.


Previously, the Club World Cup has featured the champions of
Europe, South America, Central and North America, Africa, Asia
and Oceania, but in a bid to boost interest in the host country
the format is being amended.


"The executive agreed to introduce a qualifying play-off between
the Oceania champions and the league champions of the host
nation, with the victors then lining up alongside the champions
of the five other confederations," FIFA said on its website.


Japan will host the tournament for the third consecutive year in
December, meaning the J-League champions will play off against
what will likely be a New Zealand side with Australia now part of
the Asian confederation.


FIFA had previously been considering increasing the number of
teams to eight, which would have included one from the host
nation.


The Club World Cup, won by Brazil's Internacional last year, has
replaced the traditional fixture between the European and South
American title-holders played since 1960.
