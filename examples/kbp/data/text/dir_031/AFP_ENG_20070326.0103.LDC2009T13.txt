India's top software exporter Tata Consultancy Services may get a
minority stake in a unit of Deutsche Telekom in return for one
billion dollars in services, reports said Monday.


The Hindustan Times said Tata Consultancy, or TCS, could pick up
the stake in T-Systems, a unit of Europe's largest telecom firm,
in exchange for executing work in software and other services
worth one billion dollars.


"According to highly placed sources, the barter deal will give
TCS a minority stake in T-Systems, equivalent to the value of the
service contract," the Hindustan Times newspaper said.


It said TCS would get as much as 10 percent in T-Systems if the
deal is concluded and that talks are at an advanced stage.


TCS declined to comment on the report.


"The reports are speculative and we do not wish to comment on
this," a TCS spokesman told AFP.


TCS, part of Indian tea to steel conglomerate the Tata Group, has
been scouting for acquisitions to boost its presence in Europe
after making a strong presence in South Asia and South America.


T-Systems, a Deutsche Telekom subsidiary, is an IT information
provider across 20 countries which also provides consultancy and
outsourcing facilities.
