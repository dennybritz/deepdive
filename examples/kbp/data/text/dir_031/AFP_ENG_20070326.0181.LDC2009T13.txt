Cricket officials from England and Pakistan have reached an
agreement for compensation for Pakistan's forfeiture of last
summer's Oval Test match.


Under the agreement, Pakistan will waive their right to a fee for
a Twenty20 match as part of their tour of England in summer 2012
to settle the claim.


The Test match was declared forfeit by umpires Darrell Hair and
Billy Doctrove after the Pakistan players stayed in their
dressing room after the tea interval in protest at a five-run
penalty for ball tampering.


The English Cricket Board estimated they lost 800,000 pounds
(1.2million euros) after being forced to offer refunds to fans
who had bought tickets for the fourth day of the Test, which was
abandoned after tea, and for the final day.
