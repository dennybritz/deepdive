British film director Ken Loach, maker of "Kes", "Land and
Freedom" and "The Wind that Shakes the Barley", has declared his
support for the Trotskyist candidate Olivier Besancenot in the
French presidential election.


"In France you have a chance to vote for someone who in principle
will take the side of the working people against the big multi-
nationals, and I hope he's very successful. Good luck to him,"
Loach says in a videotaped message on Besancenot's website.


A 32-year-old postman, Besancenot is running for the second time
as the candidate of the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR). In
2002 he won 4.25 percent of the vote.


Loach has a large following in France and has won several awards
at the Cannes film festival. "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" --
about the Irish war of independence -- won the Palme d'Or there
in 2006.
