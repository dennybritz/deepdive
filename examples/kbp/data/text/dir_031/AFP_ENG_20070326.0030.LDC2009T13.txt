Australian share prices closed 0.65 percent higher Monday, buoyed
by gains on Wall Street and domestic merger and acquisition
activity as investors pushed stocks to just short of the historic
6,000 points level, dealers said.


The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 rose 38.4 points to 5,990.7 while
the broader All Ordinaries index climbed 37.4 points to 5,970.5.
