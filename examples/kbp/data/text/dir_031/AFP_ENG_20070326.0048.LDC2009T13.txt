Australian anti-doping authorities said Monday there was no
evidence of a doping violation after analysing material found at
a hotel where World Swimming Championship competitors are
staying.


A box holding a syringe and plastic vials was found last week in
a common area of the Parkview Hotel in the beachside suburb of St
Kilda, where people connected with the Australian Formula One
Grand Prix had also been staying.


"The containers have been examined and determined not to contain
any substance prohibited under the World Anti-Doping Code," the
Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) said.


"Small bags found with the containers however, have tested
positive to the presence of Benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of
cocaine, which is a banned substance in-competition under the
WADA Code.


"ASADA at this time has no evidence which links the prohibited
substance to an in-competition violation of doping rules by
either an athlete or athlete support person."


It said its information would be passed to the World Anti-Doping
Agency as well as organisers of the World Swimming Championships
and the Formula One Grand Prix "as a courtesy".


Police closed their investigation into the incident last week.


The 1998 world championships in Perth were overshadowed when
Human Growth Hormone was found in a Chinese competitor's luggage
and four Chinese swimmers tested positive for drugs.
