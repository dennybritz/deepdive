The European Commission on Monday told Poland and the Czech
Republic to slash greenhouse gas emissions quotas on their energy
intensive industries but accepted French plans.


The European Union's executive arm said that it could accept the
Czech and Polish plans to allocate tradeable emissions quotas
only if they cut their proposed cap for the 2008-2012 period.


The quotas are the cornerstone of the EU's innovative emissions
trading system, under which industrial polluters can buy and sell
unused credits.


The system is supposed to help the EU cut carbon emissions under
the Kyoto Protocol, but its credibility has taken a beating
recently because member states have allotted more permits to
pollute than industrial plants need.


The commission said that Poland's carbon dioxide quotas should
not exceed 208.5 million tonnes, 26.7 percent lower than Warsaw
has proposed, while the Czech Republic was told that its CO2
quotas should not exceed 86.8 million tonnes, 14.8 percent lower
proposed.


The commission accepted France's CO2 quota capping emissions
allowances at 132.8 million tonnes, but only after Paris withdrew
an original plan for 155.6 million tonnes.


The commission has already approved 17 member states' national
allocation plans for the 2008-2012 trading period, mostly
conditional upon reductions.
