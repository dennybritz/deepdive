Japanese share prices closed up 0.24 percent Monday in quiet
trade as investors awaited an upcoming slew of US and domestic
economic data, dealers said.


They said many investors took a breather after four days of gains
last week, with the major players sitting on the sidelines ahead
of the fiscal year-end book closing on Friday.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index of leading
shares rose 41.35 points to 17,521.96.


The TOPIX index of all issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first
section eased 0.57 points to 1,741.37.
