American world record holder Brendan Hansen repulsed his great
Japanese rival Kosuke Kitajima to retain his world 100-metre
breaststroke crown at the world championships Monday.


Hansen led throughout and out-touched Kitajima by 16-100ths of a
second in a thrilling finish.


Both swimmers went under one minute with Hansen clocking 59.80
seconds and Kitajima 59.96secs. Australian Brenton Rickard took
the bronze in 1:00.58.


Kitajima, who beat Hansen for the gold medal at the 2004 Athens
Olympics, had thrown down the gauntlet to the American with two
faster times in the heats and the semi-finals, but when it came
to the race Hansen prevailed.


"I put a lot of effort this year into this race," Hansen said.
"This is the first time I've ever been here, the crowds have been
great so far."


"This is a good thing but it's just motivation for the Olympics -
that's where the big races are."


Hansen holds the world record at 59.13sec and is working towards
winning the gold medal at next year's Beijing Olympics.


He took the world mark off Kitajima at the 2003 Barcelona world
championships and shaved the record again last year to 59.13sec.


"We have a pretty healthy rivalry," Hansen said of Kitajima. "We
make each other swim fast but we always shake hands at the end of
the race. He brings out the best in me and I appreciate that."
