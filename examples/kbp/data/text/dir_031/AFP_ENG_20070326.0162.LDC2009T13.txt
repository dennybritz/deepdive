Northern Ireland's rival party leaders Ian Paisley and Gerry
Adams were to hold a first-ever meeting shortly, a Sinn Fein
official said Monday, voicing hope for an accord on a power-
sharing deal.


"The meeting is going to happen in the very next short while,"
said Sinn Fein party chairperson Mary Lou McDonald, adding: "We
are very hopeful that progress can be made."
