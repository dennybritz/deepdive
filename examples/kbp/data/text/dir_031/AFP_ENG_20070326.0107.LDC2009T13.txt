Journalists in the Gaza Strip staged a 24-hour strike on Monday
to demand the release of BBC reporter Alan Johnston as his
hostage ordeal entered a third week.


Johnston, who was kidnapped from his car as he was driving home
from work in Gaza City on March 12, has now been held for longer
than any other hostage since the spate of abductions of
foreigners in the Palestinian territory began two years ago.


The longest captivity previously endured by foreign hostages in
Gaza was the two-week ordeal last August of two journalists for
the US-based Fox News television network.


It was the second time that Palestinian journalists had stopped
work in solidarity with Johnston, who has been based in Gaza for
the past three years, one of the very few Western reporters to do
so amid the mounting lawlessness in the territory since Israel's
2005 pullout.


The 44-year-old is a seasoned reporter with past postings to
Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.


Western governments have expressed increasing frustration with
his continued capitivity.


"We are using every channel and opportunity that we can to try to
secure his release," British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett
told MPs last Tuesday.


The same day European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana
said his officials had also been "doing the utmost" to get
Johnston freed.
