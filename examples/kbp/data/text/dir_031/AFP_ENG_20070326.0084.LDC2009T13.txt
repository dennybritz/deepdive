India's largest real estate developer DLF said it signed a 20
billion dollar deal Monday with Al Nakheel of the United Arab
Emirates to build two townships in India.


The companies will initially invest five billion dollars each in
the next three years to build complete townships at unspecified
locations in India, according to a company executive with DLF who
declined to be named pending a formal announcement later in the
day.


"We have signed a 50:50 joint venture with Al Nakheel to develop
integrated townships with an investment of 20 billion dollars,"
the executive said.


He said the townships would cover 40,000 acres (16,200 hectares)
of land, of which 70 percent has aleady been bought.


In January, DLF said it had filed a new and downsized initial
share sale offer with the market regulator almost six months
after investors balked at its plan to raise three billion
dollars.


DLF said in a statement it now planned to raise 100 billion
rupees (2.2 billion dollars) via an initial public offer (IPO)
sometime in 2007, down from the 130 billion rupees of shares it
proposed to sell in August 2006.


The August share sale plan was withdrawn after major investment
banks said the company's plans were unrealistic. New Delhi-based
DLF now plans to sell 10.1 percent of the firm, or 175 million
shares, to fund the construction of hotels and free-trade zones.
