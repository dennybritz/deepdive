A great-grandfather was jailed for 10 years in Australia Monday
for shooting and wounding a pursuer as he and his middle-aged son
fled a bungled robbery on foot.


The judge told Rodney Finlay, 74, who was captured dripping wet
by police after swimming a canal in his bid to escape, that he
was a "stupid and savage old man".


The court heard that on the night of October 25, 2003, Finlay,
who was armed with a pistol, and his 53-year-old son, also called
Rodney, tried to break into a canal-front property in Bundall on
Australia's Gold Coast.


The occupant and a neighbour, Alex Von Zeppelin, 19, heard noises
and began chasing the two men.


Finlay, described by the judge as "unfit, overweight and slow on
your feet", warned he would shoot as they closed in on him, and
then fired once, hitting Von Zeppelin in the chest.


"You were prepared to take the life of a young man who did no
more than try to protect property," said judge Richard Chesterman
in the Brisbane Supreme Court.


"You could have surrendered and saved everyone a great deal of
difficulty."


The judge noted that Finlay had stayed out of trouble for a
quarter of a century since his last conviction for assault and
possessing a starting gun.


"Why you would, at your age, turn to a life of crime is beyond
understanding," he said.


Finlay's lawyer said his client had been married for 56 years,
had three children and enjoyed a "very quiet" life, and loved to
play dominoes with his wife.


His son was jailed in January for 12 months for attempted
burglary.
