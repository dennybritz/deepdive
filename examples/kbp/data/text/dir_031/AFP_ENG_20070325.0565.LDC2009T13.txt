Japanese high-tech giant Canon Inc said Monday that it will grant
permanent full-time status to some 1,000 casual workers as it
braces for the retirement of a first wave of baby boomers.


Once debt-ridden Canon, often seen as a showcase success story in
Japan's economic recovery, will add some 5,000 full time
employees over the next two years to stop its workforce
shrinking, a company spokeswoman said.


Of that, 1,000 will be drawn from casual workers who already put
in full business hours at Canon factories, she said.


The Japanese IT and camera giant will give direct, temporary
contracts to another 2,500 casual workers -- including many who
were previously hired through employment agencies -- and recruit
1,500 new graduates.


"Many of our experienced workers are set to retire. Our
employment plan should help us to retain skilled workers and pass
on the skills to new people," the spokeswoman said.


The move follows a series of critical media reports that charged
the company with violating employment laws by not offering
adequate labour protection, hitting its image.


Many Japanese companies stepped up the hiring of lower-paid part-
time workers in the 1990s to try to cut their costs amid a
catastrophic economic downturn.


Now competition among Japanese companies for skilled workers is
heating up, with unemployment at an eight-year low of 4.0 percent
as the economy recovers from its long slump.


Many major Japanese companies are facing similar labour problems
due to the departure of older employees and as the number of
young in Japan's population declines.
