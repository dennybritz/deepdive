Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia won China its fourth consecutive 3m
synchronised springboard world title on Monday, easily outscoring
pairs from Germany and Australia.


Guo and Wu amassed 355.80 points compared to 318.45 for Ditte
Kotzian and Heike Fischer of Germany and 313.14 for Australia's
Briony Cole and Sharleen Stratton.


China has now won eight of the nine diving titles here with only
the men's 10m platform left to go.


The relaxed Chinese duo, the reigning Olympic champions, were
never troubled with the only surprise being the failure of 1998
world champions Yuliya Pakhalina and Irina Lashko of Russia to
make the medals.


Lashko had accused the judges of being biased against her last
week.


Guo and Wu staged a one-two finish in the 3m springboard final on
Sunday.
