Singapore motorists will soon be able to drive with number plates
sporting personalised messages, a report said Monday.


The vanity plates, common in North America, could be available
for a fee to Singapore drivers later this year, the Straits Times
reported.


It quoted the Land Transport Authority as saying it is still
working on details of the plan.


The Authority could not immediately comment when reached by AFP.


Plates with offensive or sensitive messages are unlikely to be
allowed, the paper said.
