The wife of Thailand's deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra
was charged with tax evasion on Monday, in the first criminal
case brought against his family since the coup six months ago.


Pojaman Shinawatra, her step-brother Banpot Damapong and her
personal secretary Kanchanapa Honghern were charged with tax
evasion and perjury, court officials said.


The case, which could see all three go to prison, stems from a
1997 deal in which Pojaman and her step-brother sold shares in
Shinawatra Computer and Communication, which later became
Thailand's telecom giant Shin Corp.


The charges are not related to last year's controversial sale of
Shin Corp to Singapore's Temasek Holdings, a move which sparked
street protests that eventually led to the September coup.


The case against Pojaman is the first to reach trial out of a
raft of investigations into Thaksin's family since the military
ousted him over accusations of widespread corruption.


The proceedings are likely to provide a boost to the junta, which
has come under criticism over the slow pace of graft probes.


The trio were released on bail of five million baht (150,000
dollars) each, their lawyer Noppadon Pattama said.


"We are confident we will receive justice in the trial," Noppadon
said.


"We are ready to prove her innocence in court."


Pojaman wore a yellow suit to the criminal court -- a color
signifying respect for the nation's king -- but said nothing as
she entered or left the building.


Some 100 police guarded the area around the courthouse, while 20
of her supporters stood nearby with red roses.
