Nearly 10 million people across southern and southwestern China
are suffering from drinking water shortages due to a fierce
drought, state media reported on Monday.


A lack of rainfall has affected water supplies for 9.8 million
people and  9.1 million head of livestock, the Beijing Morning
Post said.


Both figures had doubled since early March, it said.


Precipitation has been scarce or non-existent and temperatures
abnormally high so far this spring in the provinces of Sichuan,
Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Hainan, the region of Guangxi and the
large municipality of Chongqing.


The dry spell is affecting 25,833 square kilometres (10,300
square miles) of land, including 16,146 square kilometres of
farmland, with crops withering in some areas, the paper said.


Large rivers and lakes in the affected region are 10 to 30
percent lower than normal, with water levels as much as 50
percent lower in some areas.


The conditions have reduced water levels in the Yangtze river to
historic lows and raised concerns over the massive Three Gorges
dam's ability to generate power, state media reported last week.


China experienced an increase in extreme weather events last
year, including a severe drought in the southwest, which the
country's top meteorologist said last month were likely caused by
climate change.
