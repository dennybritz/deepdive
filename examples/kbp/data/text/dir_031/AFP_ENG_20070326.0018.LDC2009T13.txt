India's main Maoist rebel outfit has officially claimed
responsibility for the killing of 55 policemen in eastern
Chhattisgarh state this month, in a statement sent to local
media.


The guerrilla arm of the Communist Party of India-Maoist said the
March 15 killings had been carried out in retaliation for an
anti-rebel crackdown in the region, according to the statement
sent to the Press Trust of India.


The group also said it had launched the late-night attack in
response to a state government-sponsored peace campaign, which
has resulted in anti-Maoist marches.


The PTI report did not carry any direct quotes from the
statement.


In one of their worst attacks, the rebels hurled grenades, petrol
bombs and fired indiscriminately at the security post in the
state's Rani Bodli village. Police in the jungle camp were
apparently caught totally off guard.


Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in Chhattisgarh
because of the conflict and are now living in tent shelters as
Indian counter-insurgency forces operate in the countryside.


The rebels, who launched their armed campaign in 1967, also
operate in 14 other of India's 29 states. New Delhi refuses to
negotiate with them.


Last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described the Maoists as
the single biggest threat to the nation's internal security.
