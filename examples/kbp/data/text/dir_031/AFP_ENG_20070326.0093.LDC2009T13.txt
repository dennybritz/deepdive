Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Monday it would be a
"very positive development" if Arab countries renewed their
support for a Saudi peace initiative he once spurned.


"If moderate Arab countries try to advance the process along the
lines of the Saudi initiative I will look at it as a very
positive development," Olmert said at a joint press conference
with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.


The plan first floated five years ago calls for full Arab
recognition of Israel if it returns to its 1967 borders, allows
the creation of a Palestinian state and accepts the return of
Palestinian refugees.


It is one of the top items at an Arab summit being held in Riyadh
on Wednesday.
