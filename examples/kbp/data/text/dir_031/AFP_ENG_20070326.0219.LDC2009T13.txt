Fifteen British sailors captured last week by Iran were detained
in Iraqi not Iranian waters as maintained by Tehran, Iraq's
Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said on Monday.


His ministry issued a statement after Zebari telephoned his
Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki late Sunday to urge Iran
to free the British navy personnel whom he said had been
operating in Iraqi waters.


"The minister stressed that they (the British navy personnel),
according to Iraqi authorities' information, were detained inside
Iraqi territorial waters," said the statement.


"They are part of the multinational forces (based in Iraq) with
the approval of the Iraqi government and in accordance with the
relevant UN Security Council resolution," it added.


"The minister demanded that they be released and the issue be
tackled wisely," the Iraqi foreign ministry said.
