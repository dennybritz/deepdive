German sports car maker Porsche said on Monday that it had raised
its stake in Volkswagen to a level which would automatically
trigger a takeover bid.


In a statement Porsche said it had exercised an option on 3.5
percent of Volkswagen's shares to take its stake in the carmaker
to 30.9 percent.


Under German law, a 30-percent stake in a company obliges the
holder to make a full takeover bid. The shares would be
transferred on Wednesday.


The move by Porsche, which has been rumoured for some time, seems
to be an effort to protect VW from a hostile raid from another
source.


In an interview with the Bild newspaper published on Monday,
Porsche's CEO Wendelin Wiedeking said: "If a hedge fund
dismantled VW and sold that on the stock market, we would lose
our most important partner. We cannot let that happen, that's why
we acted."


The timing is significant because a European court is expected to
rule soon against a German law dating from 1960 which caps the
voting rights of shareholders at 20 percent, even if they own a
greater share.


The European Commission believes the law violates EU legislation.


The move by Porsche to raise its stake also confirms its desire
to tighten its control of a company with which it has close
historical and industrial links.


Porsche and VW developed the Cayenne and Touareg four-wheel-drive
models in a joint venture, and two senior Porsche executives sit
on the VW board.
