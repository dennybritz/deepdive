Former Swedish women's coach Marika Domanski-Lyfors was due in
China on Monday for talks on becoming the first foreign coach of
the national women's football squad, state press said.


She was to hold final-stage negotiations with Chinese football
officials in the city of Wuhan and could sign a contract during
her stay to become coach for this year's World Cup, the Beijing
Morning Post reported.


"If everything goes well, she could be formally announced as the
new coach this week," the paper said.


Domanski-Lyfors was quoted by the paper on Saturday as saying
that talks had so far "gone really smoothly."


The Women's World Cup starts in six months and whoever is the
women's coach will be under huge pressure after Chinese sport
officials set the squad a minimum target of a semi-final finish.


Domanski-Lyfors, described in the Chinese press as "tougher than
any male coach," led Sweden to the 2003 World Cup final, which
they lost to Germany.


She stepped down in 2005 after nine years but still works for the
Swedish Football Federation and coaches the under-21 side.


She is reportedly the only candidate for the post of the
currently troubled "steel roses", as China's women's team is
known.


The side has been on a downward spiral for months and last week
lost its caretaker coach who stepped down just two months after
the head coach abandoned the squad citing ill health.


China have slipped to ninth place in the women's football
standings in the years since they lost to the United States in
the final of the 1999 World Cup in a penalty shoot-out.
