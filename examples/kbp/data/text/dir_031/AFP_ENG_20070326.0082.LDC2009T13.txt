Arab foreign ministers met in Riyadh Monday ahead of a summit
which is expected to revive an Arab offer of peace with Israel.


The chief diplomats of the 22-member Arab League will draw up the
agenda for the annual meeting of heads of state, due to open in
the Saudi capital on Wednesday with only Libya boycotting the
gathering.


"Activating the Arab peace initiative" will top the agenda,
Palestinian foreign minister Ziad Abu Amr told AFP, echoing
comments by other Arab officials that the blueprint will not be
amended.


The Saudi-inspired Arab plan proposes full noramlisation of
relations with Israel if it fully withdraws from all the land it
occupied in 1967, permits the creation of an independent
Palestinian state and allows the return of Palestinian refugees.


Israel rejected the take-it-or-leave-it initiative when it was
first adopted at the Beirut Arab summit in 2002, but Israeli
leaders have recently spoken more positively of the ideas as a
starting point for negotiations.


A Saudi-Egyptian proposal to look into security challenges facing
the Arab world under the heading of "Arab national security" will
also figure high on the agenda, one Arab minister told AFP
requesting anonymity.


He said the debate will also cover efforts to help national
reconciliation in Iraq.


Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, his country's first Kurdish head
of state, is attend the two-day summit but Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki, a Shiite Arab, will not be accompanying him.
