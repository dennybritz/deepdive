German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung has spoken out in
support of an US plans for a missile defence shield in eastern
Europe that have triggered a row with Russia.


Germany was mindful that the threat of rockets being launched
against Europe was real and growing, Jung said in the
Handelsblatt economic newspaper Monday.


"With a foreseeable increase in the number of long-distance
attack missiles we should be thinking of our national security
interests," Jung said.


The United States insists that the shield is aimed at
intercepting warheads from rogue states like Iran.


But Russia sees plans to locate part of the shield in Poland and
the Czech Republic as a sign of intimidation and has warned its
old Cold War enemy that it would come up with a "highly effective
response."


Germany, as current EU president, has sought to calm the tensions
but the issue appears to be dividing the country's ruling left-
right coalition.


Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a member of the Social
Democrats, has warned the United States that Europe does not want
another arms race.


Jung insisted however there was no discord within the cabinet.


"I assure you that in the cabinet we agree on this," he said.


Conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Washington,
Warsaw and Prague to discuss the issue within NATO and to hold
direct talks with Russia.


Parts of the shield are already in place in the United States,
Britain and Greenland, and Pentagon officials say the plan is to
have the system operational by 2011-2012.
