A television station in communist Vietnam has bought the rights
to screen Vietnam Idol, a local version of the hit talent contest
American Idol, a spokesman for the station here said Monday.


Thousands of singers are expected to take a stab at fame in the
spinoff, with semi-finals planned for June and the final round
for July, said Kieu Van Tan, head of the arts and music
department at Ho Chi Minh City Television.


"Anyone can become a star on Vietnam Idol, including you,"
promises the show's official website. "Vietnam Idol gives you
support to be the brightest and the most professional on stage."


Contestants must be aged 16 to 30 to take part in the show --
which will be screened on seven stations nationwide -- and
audience members will cast their votes using the Internet, phone
calls or text messages.
