Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey are to merge to create the
biggest British housebuilding group worth about 5.0 billion
pounds, they announced on Monday.


The deal to form Taylor Wimpey with a market value of 7.4 billion
euros or 9.8 billion dollars, will result in pro forma revenues
totalling more than 6.7 billion pounds a year, an official
statement said.


"The boards of Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey are pleased to
announce today that they have reached agreement on the terms of a
recommended all-share merger," it added.


Taylor Wimpey would build about 22,000 houses in Britain a year,
and about 9,000 in the United States where the property market is
showing signs of struggling.
