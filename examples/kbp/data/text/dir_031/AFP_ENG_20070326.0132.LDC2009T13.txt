Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Monday that he "would
not hesitate" to take part in a regional Arab meeting if invited.


"If such an invitation would come my way, I would look at it in a
very positive way," Olmert told a joint press conference with UN
chief Ban Ki-moon in Jerusalem.


"Assuming I would get a visa, I would not hesitate to
participate."


His remarks come as US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is
visiting the region in a bid to press Arab leaders to support
effors to revive Israeli- Palestinian peace talks.


Ban said such a summit was "a very interesting and useful idea to
consider but we need more consultations."


The two had been asked whether the United Nations had invited
Israel and the Palestinians to participate in a meeting between
the Middle East peace Quartet -- the European Union, Russia, UN
and the United States -- and the so-called Arab Quartet -- Egypt,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.


A senior US official travelling with Rice confirmed that such a
meeting was under consideration, saying it would be "a good
idea," but "it's a little premature."


Palestinian officials confirmed that such a meeting has been at
the centre of discussions between Rice and regional leaders
during her latest trip.
