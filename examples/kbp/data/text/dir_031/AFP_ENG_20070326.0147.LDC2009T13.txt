World oil prices struck the highest points so far in 2007,
nearing 64 dollars a barrel in London on Monday as the market
fretted over rising tensions in major crude producer Iran,
traders said.


In London at about 0900 GMT, the price of Brent North Sea crude
for May delivery rose 75 cents to 63.93 dollars a barrel. It had
earlier struck 63.97 dollars -- the highest point since December
6.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, gained 64 cents to 62.92 dollars after a peak of
62.96 dollars.


Iran, the world's fourth-biggest producer of oil, said Sunday it
will restrict its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog in
retaliation for fresh Security Council sanctions over its
disputed atomic programme.


The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to
impose the sanctions in a bid to pressure Iran into freezing its
uranium enrichment programme.


The decision followed word on Friday that Iran had seized 15
British personnel in the Gulf, a move which roiled the market.
