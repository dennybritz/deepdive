Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said on Monday he would
seek the withdrawal of all Romanian troops from Iraq "by
Christmas" following agreement with his country's allies.


"It is time to bring our troops home. I will do everything in my
power, in accordance with my constitutional duties, to bring them
back by Christmas based on a timeframe agreed upon with our
allies and partners," Tariceanu said.


"I will fight to convince all those who are against our soldiers
dining at home with their families at Christmas," he added.


Tariceanu's Liberal Party has repeatedly favoured a withdrawal of
troops from Iraq.


Parliament will take the final decision on the matter after the
Supreme Defence Council led by President Traian Basescu makes its
recommendation.


Romania, an early US ally in Iraq, currently has 605 troops in
the country, stationed mostly in southern Talil and Basra under
British command.
