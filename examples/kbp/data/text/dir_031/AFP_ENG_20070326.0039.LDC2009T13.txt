Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airlines on Monday announced the
immediate suspension of flights to Sri Lanka following a rebel
air raid on a base next to the island's only international
airport.


"Safety is a top priority at Cathay Pacific and a careful
assessment of the situation will be made before services are
resumed," the airline said in a statement received here.


Cathay normally operates daily flights to Colombo from Hong Kong.
The airline said 119 passengers who were stranded in Sri Lanka
when their flight was cancelled on Monday were to be flown home
Tuesday in a special aircraft.
