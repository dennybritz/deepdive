An earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale rocked southern
Iran on Monday near the city of Bam, which was devastated by a
killer quake more than three years ago.


The quake occurred at 10:06 am (0636 GMT), the state news agency
IRNA said, adding that it had no information on casualties or
damage.


Iran sits astride several major faults in the earth's crust, and
is prone to frequent earthquakes, many of them devastating.


The worst quake in recent times hit Bam in December 2003, killing
31,000 people, about a quarter of the city's population, and
destroying the city's ancient mud- built citadel.
