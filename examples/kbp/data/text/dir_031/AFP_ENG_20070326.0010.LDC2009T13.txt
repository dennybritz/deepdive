The wife of Thailand's deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra
was charged with tax evasion on Monday, in the first criminal
case brought against his family since the coup six months ago.


The charges are not related to last year's controversial sale of
the telecom firm that Thaksin founded, Shin Corp, to a Singapore
firm but stem from an earlier sale of shares in the company.


The case against Pojaman Shinawatra is the first to come to court
out of a raft of investigations into Thaksin's family since the
military ousted him in September, accusing him of widespread
corruption.


She was released on bail of five million baht (150,000 dollars).
If convicted, she could face up to seven years in prison, court
officials said.


The proceedings are likely to provide a boost to the junta, which
has come under criticism over the slow pace of graft probes.
