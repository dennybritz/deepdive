Deutsche Bank, the biggest bank in Germany, said on Monday it
planned to reinforce retail banking interests in China by
applying to incorporate its activities there under Chinese law.


Deutsche Bank said in a statement that it had "formally advised
the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) of its decision to
apply for local incorporation in China."


In addition, Deutsche Bank said it would set up its Chinese
headquarters in Beijing, while keeping a foreign currency booking
branch in Shanghai.


"Local incorporation expresses not only our commitment to China
but also our desire to participate directly in the development of
the local financial services market there," said the head of
Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific division, Colin Grassie.


The head of Deutsche Bank China, Lee Zhang, said: "Local
incorporation is an important step in the implementation of our
China strategy. We are already well- positioned for expansion and
local incorporation will allow us to accelerate our growth plans
across all product lines."


Other big international banks have already applied for local
incorporation under a new law passed by Beijing last year.


Deutsche Bank is already present in China via a 19-percent stake
in Harvest Asset Managment, the country's biggest independent
asset managment company, and via a 9.9-percent stake in Hua Xia
Bank.
