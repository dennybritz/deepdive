China Telecom reported Monday a 2.76 percent drop in 2006 net
profit to 27.14 billion yuan (3.5 billion US) on the back of weak
growth in operating revenues and higher expenses.


China's largest fixed-line operator said operating revenues edged
up just 3.4 percent to 175.09 billion yuan while expenses rose
4.7 percent to 136.48 billion yuan.


As a result, operating profit fell to 38.61 billion yuan from
38.95 billion yuan.


Chairman and chief executive officer Wang Xiaochu said the group
focused its attention last year on the development of its voice
business "in response to an increasingly competitive environment.


"Instead of directly competing on pricing and driving revenue
growth solely based on subscriber base expansion, we accelerated
the development of integrated information services and enriched
the value content of the transformation business," he said.


He said revenue from non-voice business accounted for 29 percent
of operating revenues, up 5.0 percent from a year earlier.


Wang said the number of broadband subscribers rose 34.7 percent
to 28.32 million, while the total number of fixed lines in
service rose 6.2 percent to 223 million.
