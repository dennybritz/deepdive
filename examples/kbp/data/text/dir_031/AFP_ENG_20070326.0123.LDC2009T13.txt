Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Monday that he "would
not hesitate" to take part in a regional Arab meeting if invited.


"If such an invitation would come my way, I would look at it in a
very positive way," Olmert told a joint press conference with UN
chief Ban Ki-moon in Jerusalem.


"Assuming I would get a visa, I would not hesitate to
participate."
