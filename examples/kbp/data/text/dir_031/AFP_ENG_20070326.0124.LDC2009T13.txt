A Japanese executive from Toshiba was found dead in Taiwan on
Monday in what police suspected was an accidental gas leak,
police said.


Police found three bodies after breaking into the home of 60
-year-old Kazunori Ishii, representative of the Toshiba Home
Technology Corporation in Taiwan.


The other two were identified as Taiwanese woman Chen Ling-ni,
40, and her seven-year-old daughter Chen Nai-hsuan, police said,
adding that their relationship with Ishii was not immediate
clear.


"They probably died two days ago... the initial investigation
showed they might have suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning,"
a police officer told reporters.


The company declined to comment on the incident.
