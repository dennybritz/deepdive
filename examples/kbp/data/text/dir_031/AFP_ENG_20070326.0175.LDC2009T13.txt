The cost of the Iraq War and President George W. Bush's self-
described War on Terror has led to funding losses of almost two
billion dollars for the key US cancer research agency, according
to calculations published in the latest issue of The Lancet
Oncology.


The two billion amounts to the accumulated shortfall in funding
for the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) by the time Bush will
have left office in January 2009, it said.


"The disproportionate focus on the 'War on Terror' is indirectly
undermining the ability of the NCI to operate effectively," The
Lancet Oncology said in a strongly-worded commentary entitled "A
war of attrition."


The NCI, founded nearly 70 years ago, has battled with serious
under-investment, poor morale and grant reductions since 2004,
the journal said.


The agency's funding was frozen in 2004, 2005 and 2006, it was
cut in 2007 and another reduction is scheduled in 2008. The cuts
have been amplified by the effects of inflation, the journal
said.


The impact for the NCI in 2008 is a shortfall of 200 million
dollars, compared with record defence allocations of 625 billion,
the commentary said.


"The Bush administration's cynical attack on healthcare to offset
the highest defence budget on record shows either an absence of
forward planning or an incredible indifference towards the
American people," the London-based journal said.
