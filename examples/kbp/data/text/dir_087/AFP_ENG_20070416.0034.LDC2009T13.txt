Separatist militants have killed four people in attacks across
Thailand's restive south, police said Monday, while five schools
were set ablaze in the region.


One army ranger and one militant were killed in Narathiwat
province late Sunday when Islamic insurgents raided an army base.


Local police said about 10 militants opened fire on the base
where 100 policemen and soldiers were stationed. Three policemen
were also injured in the 20-minute firefight between the two
sides.


All the militants escaped and took the body of the dead insurgent
with them, police said.


On Monday in nearby Yala province, a Muslim district mayor was
shot dead in front of his house by suspected militants. Another
Muslim man was killed in a drive-by shooting in front of a tea
shop two kilometres (1.2 miles) away.


Five schools, one health office and a teacher's house were also
set on fire in Pattani province. No one was injured.


Militants, who are battling for a separate Muslim state in
Thailand's southernmost region, frequently stage arson attacks on
schools, which are seen as representing the central Buddhist
state.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in the Muslim-majority
provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani since the latest
separatist insurgency broke out in January 2004.


Violence has escalated in the past six months despite moves by
the military- backed government to bring peace to the region
bordering Malaysia.
