PetroChina, the nation's largest oil company, said Monday it
recorded an oil and gas output of 277 million barrels equivalent
in the first quarter, up 3.7 percent from the year earlier.


Crude oil output reached 209 million barrels, up 1.5 million
barrels from a year earlier with natural gas output standing at
410.6 billion cubic feet, up 14 percent year-on-year.


The company said part of the oil and gas wells in Liaohe, Dagang
and Jidong oilfields were shut down during the period due to the
impact of severe tides and snow storms in east China's Bohai Bay
area.


But it had adopted a recovery plan to secure crude oil
production.


PetroChina said its business plans are proceeding as scheduled
and key operational data are on target.
