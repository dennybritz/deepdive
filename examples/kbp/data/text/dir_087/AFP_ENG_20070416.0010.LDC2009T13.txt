Chinese share prices rose 1.27 percent in Monday morning trade on
renewed money inflows, due partly to a strong yuan, with power
and telecom stocks buoyed, dealers said.


They said concerns over profit-taking was offset by the sustained
capital inflows backed by the strong yuan.


"Although some investors were worried that the profit-taking seen
last Friday could continue today, the market was bolstered by
renewed fund inflows thanks to a rising yuan and solid corporate
earnings released over the weekend," said Zeng Bo, an analyst at
Changjiang Securities.


The central bank today set the yuan central parity rate at a
record of 7.7220 to the dollar.


"In the short run, as fresh capital continues flowing in and more
blue chips announce their first-quarter results, the bullish
trend will likely be sustained," Zeng added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning up
44.54 points or 1.27 percent at 3,562.81, after hitting an
intraday all-time high of 3,572.33.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 46.69 points or 1.26 percent at
3,745.15 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was up 19.69 points or
1.98 percent at 1,012.63, a new record.
