Repatriation of funds raised by Chinese companies overseas partly
accounted for a giant leap in China's forex reserves in the first
quarter, state press reported Monday, citing the central bank.


Reserves jumped as banks and companies brought home funds raised
in overseas share sales as they expected the local currency to
appreciate, the Shanghai Securities Journal said, citing central
bank deputy governor Wu Xiaoling.


China's foreign exchange reserves, already the world's largest,
rose by 135.7 billion dollars in the first quarter to top 1.2
trillion dollars at the end of March, the central bank said last
week.


The trade surplus, one main source of the bulging reserves, stood
at 46.6 billion dollars in the first three months, while foreign
direct investment, another big contributor, reached 15.9 billion
dollars, earlier data showed.


The two figures added together, 62.5 billion dollars, were well
below the increase in reserves in the first three months of the
year.


This led some analysts to suspect the rise was caused partly by
"hot money" -- speculative funds entering the economy in
expectation of short-term gains.


The report made no mention of Wu pointing to "hot money" inflows
as a culprit.
