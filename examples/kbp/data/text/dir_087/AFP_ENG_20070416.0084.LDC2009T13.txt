Radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's political movement
formally declared its withdrawal from Iraq's beleaguered ruling
coalition on Monday at a Baghdad news conference.


Lawmaker Nassar al-Rubaie, flanked by allies from Sadr's
32-strong parliamentary bloc, said the group was pulling out of
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's unity government to push its
demands for a withdrawal of US troops.
