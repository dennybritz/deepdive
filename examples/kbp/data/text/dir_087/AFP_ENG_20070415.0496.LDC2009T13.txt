An Australian artist who believed his talent had been unfairly
overlooked was jailed for three months Monday for a "bizarre and
stupid" stunt involving a bomb hoax.


Colin Barnett, 46, placed a vase-shaped sculpture made of clay
outside the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and
contacted police to report a suspicious package.


The bomb squad rushed to the scene and found the vase, which had
"peace bomb" and "fragile: handle with care" written on it.


Judge Leo Hart of the Victorian County Court jailed Barnett for
15 months, with 12 months suspended for 15 months, and ordered
him to pay 6,319 dollars (5,294 US dollars) compensation to the
police.


He said it was a "bizarre" case in which Barnett had the dual aim
of getting recognition for his work and sending an anti-terrorism
message.


"You're an artist and believe yourself to be a good artist," Hart
said. "You believed that you had not been given the recognition
that your work deserved and you sought to rectify this."


The judge said Barnett's motives were not malicious but his
behaviour was stupid and reckless.


Barnett's lawyer Sharon Kermath told the court her client was "a
frustrated artist who wanted to be recognised by the community."


"He wanted publicity to get into the art world. No major gallery
was interested in his work."


Barnett was remorseful and "totally embarrassed" by what he did,
she said.


"The intention was to create a peace bomb because he was sick of
hatred in the world.


"He wanted to donate the artwork (the peace bomb) to the National
Gallery to represent peace."
