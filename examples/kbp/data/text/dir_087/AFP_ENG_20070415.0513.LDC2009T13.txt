Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi met with Japan's emperor on
Monday during a trip that will include a visit to a museum where
a Da Vinci masterpiece is on temporary display.


Prodi and his wife Flavia had a ceremonial audience with Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko, an Imperial Household Agency
spokesman said.


Prodi, who arrived Sunday for a three-day visit, was due later to
meet wth Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.


After the meeting, Prodi is to visit the Tokyo National Museum to
see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece "The Annunciation," which
belongs to Florence's Uffizi gallery, officials said.


Italy sent the 15th-century painting to Japan as part of a year
of cultural exchanges between the two countries.


The transfer set off protests in Italy, with one senator even
chaining himself inside the Uffizi museum, saying the work was
too fragile for transport.
