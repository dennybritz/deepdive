The United States is obstructing progress on the North Korean
nuclear stand-off by failing to free up frozen North Korean
funds, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov said on
Monday.


The US government is "not removing the obstacles to using this
money and this is creating problems. We cannot move forward as
long as the North Korean side says that it has not received the
money," Losyukov said, as quoted by the Interfax news agency.
