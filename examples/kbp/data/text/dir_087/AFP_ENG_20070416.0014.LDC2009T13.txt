Hong Kong share prices finished the Monday morning session 1.37
percent higher, tracking gains on Wall Street and in Tokyo after
tame US wholesale inflation data, dealers said.


They said blue chips and property stocks saw strong buying
interest amid fresh fund inflows.


The US core producer price index was flat in March, marking the
first time that core PPI has not shown an increase on the month
since October.


Including energy and food prices, wholesale inflation rose one
percent in March, slowing from a 1.3 percent gain in February.


The Hang Seng Index closed the morning up 279.24 points at
20,620.21, off a low of 20,489.91 and a high of 20,634.49.
