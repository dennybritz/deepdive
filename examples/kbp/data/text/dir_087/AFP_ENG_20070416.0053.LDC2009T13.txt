An English tourist pleaded guilty in a New Zealand court to
careless driving Monday after his friend was killed and six
others injured in a road smash earlier this month.


David MacCallum, 23, was driving a campervan with four friends on
a New Zealand holiday when he smashed into a four-wheel drive
vehicle near the South Island city of Blenheim on Good Friday.


Adam Birdsey, 23, was killed in the collision and a New Zealand
family of three were pulled from their vehicle as it was engulfed
in flames.


MacCallum, from North Nibley in Gloucestershire, has been charged
with one charge of careless driving causing death and six charges
of causing injury. He was bailed until his next court appearance
on April 23.
