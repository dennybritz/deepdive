Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand has been
assured that the groin injury he sustained in Saturday's FA Cup
win over Watford is less serious than at first feared.


Ferdinand limped off during the first-half of Saturday's match,
adding to an injury list that already included Gary Neville,
Nemanja Vidic, Mikael Silvestre and John O'Shea.


The player expressed fears that he could be out of action for a
long spell, but initial examinations have proved otherwise.


Ferdinand is expected to be fully fit in time for Saturday's
league game against Middlesbrough, but coach Sir Alex Ferguson
has not rule him out of being involved in the game against
Sheffield United at Old Trafford on Tuesday.


The same is also true of John O'Shea, who sat out Saturday's
victory with a minor calf injury.


Should neither Ferdinand nor O'Shea make the Sheffield game,
Ferguson will face a dilemma over who should fill the right-back
slot.


Darren Fletcher is favourite to retain the role after doing well
as an emergency replacement for Ferdinand in a back four which
saw Gabriel Heinze partner Wes Brown in the middle.


The only other plausible option is to hand 18-year-old Northern
Irishman Craig Cathcart his debut.


Normally a central defender, Cathcart has impressed and reserve-
team and academy level this term and been a key figure in
United's run to the Youth Cup final.
