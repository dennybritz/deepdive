The parents of BBC journalist Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in
Gaza more than a month ago, on Monday appealed for an end to
their ordeal after a Palestinian group said it had killed him.


"This is a desperately worrying time for us," Graham and Margaret
Johnston said in a statement, a day after Kataeb al-Jihad al-
Tawheed (The Brigades of Holy War and Unity) said it had
"executed" the 44-year-old journalist.


"We make a heartfelt appeal to anyone who may have knowledge of
Alan's situation and well-being to contact the authorities in
Gaza.


"Our son has lived and worked among the people of Gaza for the
last three years to bring their story to the outside world and we
ask everyone of them to help end this ordeal."


The British Broadcasting Corporation and the Foreign Office in
London said Monday they were still working to secure independent
verification of the claim.


Johnston, who was the only Western journalist to both live and
work in Gaza, was abducted at gunpoint on March 12 as he drove
home. He had been due to finish his posting there at the end of
March.


The Kataeb al-Jihad al-Tawheed, which said it would send a video
of Johnston's execution to media outlets, has the same name as
one initially formed by Al- Qaeda in Iraq but it is not known if
they are connected.
