Illegal drug use is on the increase among Malaysia's civil
servants, with police detaining 42 workers who tested positive
for drugs so far this year, compared to 88 in 2006, a report said
Monday.


Citing federal police statistics, the New Straits Times said
those arrested included staff from the ministries of education,
agriculture, health and home affairs, and police.


Federal Narcotics Department director Abang Abdul Wahap Abang
Julai said police had notified the relevant ministries and
agencies of the behaviour of their employees, who can be sacked
for taking or possessing illicit drugs.


"This is something to be viewed seriously, as police have a
battle on two fronts -- against traffickers and within the civil
service," Abang Abdul Wahap was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.


He said many of the users tested positive for marijuana and
amphetamine-type stimulants like Ecstasy or Erimin 5.


A government official told AFP that civil servants undergo
medical tests when they begin their jobs, and those suspected of
drug use are required to undergo further tests.


Policemen caught using drugs are terminated from service.
