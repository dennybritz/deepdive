Asafa Powell, the 100m world record-holder from Jamaica, withdrew
from from the 4x100m relay at the Mt. SAC Relays Sunday to
protect a sore right knee.


"I'm sad, but it was a little too cold for me," Powell told the
crowd at Hilmer Lodge Stadium on the campus of Mount San Antonio
College, east of Los Angeles. "Although my knee has been a bit
tender in training, I felt confident I would be able to run
today."


Powell, 24, said his decision was just a precaution, and he
didn't expect his preparations for the athletics world
championships in Osaka in August to be disrupted.


Powell, who equalled his world record of 9.77sec twice last
season, was the meeting's marquee name. He is next slated to run
on April 28 at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia.


Chris Williams flew the flag for Jamaica with a victory in the
men's 100m in 10.12sec.


And Jamaican Melaine Walker won the women's 400m hurdles in
55.99sec, fastest time of the young 2007 season. Shauna Smith of
the United States was second in 56.55.


American Joanna Hayes, who won the 100m hurdles gold at the 2004
Olympics, was third in 56.56.


Athens Olympic long jump gold medallist Dwight Phillips easily
won his signature event with a jump of 8.15m, and said his goal
this year is to capture a third world title in the discipline.


Allyson Felix, the 2004 Olympic 200m silver medallist and 2005
200m world champion, won the women's 400m in 51.74sec.


China's Gao ShuYing won the women's pole vault with an Asian
record of 4.55m.


"It's a real surprise," said Gao, who was feeling the effects of
a cold. "I just wanted to make a normal jump."
