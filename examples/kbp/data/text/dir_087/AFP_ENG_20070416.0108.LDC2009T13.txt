Indonesian armed forces chief Marshal Joko Suyanto will visit
Australia as part of moves to strengthen ties between the two
militaries, a report said Monday.


Suyanto will meet his counterpart as well as Prime Minister John
Howard and some government ministers during the two-day visit
starting Wednesday, the state Antara news agency said.


The meeting with Australian Chief of Defence Forces (Air Chief)
Marshal Allan Grant Houston is expected to follow up on a
cooperation agreement between the two forces signed several years
ago, an official told Antara.


Suyanto is also scheduled to meet Defence Minister Brendan Nelson
and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.


Indonesia's armed forces spokesman could not be immediately
reached to confirm the report and his staff declined to comment.


A spokesman for Howard said Suyanto was expected to visit
Australia next week. He said while a meeting with the prime
minister was likely, it was not yet confirmed.


The Australian Defence Force had no immediate comment on the
report.
