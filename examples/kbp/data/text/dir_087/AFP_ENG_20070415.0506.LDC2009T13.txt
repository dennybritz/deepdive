Singapore police were on the lookout Monday for illegal
immigrants, believed from Indonesia, missing after a deadly
weekend police chase at sea.


Police believed two illegal Indonesians disappeared after the
tragedy that left two members of the Police Coast Guard (PCG) and
one illegal immigrant confirmed dead.


"Police patrol officers are on the lookout for the other illegal
immigrants," police spokeswoman Cheryl Foo told AFP on Monday.


The incident happened Friday night off Tuas on Singapore's west
coast, police said.


Two police boats were on patrol in Singapore waters when a
speedboat with about six people aboard illegally entered the
area, a police statement said.


"The two PCG boats gave chase. In the course of the pursuit,
there was a collision between one of the PCG boats and the
intruding vessel. As a result, one of the PCG boats as well as
the speedboat capsized," it said.


Two officers were rescued with minor injuries from the capsized
police vessel. The bodies of their two crewmates were recovered
Saturday morning, police said.


Three illegals were rescued alive and the body of a fourth was
recovered, they said.
