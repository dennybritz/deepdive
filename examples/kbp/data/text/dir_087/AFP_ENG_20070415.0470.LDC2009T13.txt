More than twice as many Europeans would prefer French socialist
presidential candidate Segolene Royal become the country's next
president compared to her right-wing rival Nicolas Sarkozy,
according to a poll published Monday.


The Harris Interactive survey for the Financial Times business
daily showed that 16 percent of respondents in Germany, Italy,
Spain and Britain said Royal would be the best president for
France, compared to seven percent who backed Sarkozy.


Separately, 23 percent of French respondents backed Sarkozy,
while Royal was just behind at 22 percent.


France entered its last week of campaigning for the first round
of the presidential election Monday, with Sarkozy the clear
leader in the polls but still far from certain of ultimate
victory.


The head of the ruling Union for a Popular Movement has come top
in 102 out of 104 surveys taken since January, consistently
outperforming Royal, the centrist Francois Bayrou and veteran
National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.


Harris Interactive questioned 5,526 adults over the Internet in
France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain between March 28 and
April 12 for the poll.
