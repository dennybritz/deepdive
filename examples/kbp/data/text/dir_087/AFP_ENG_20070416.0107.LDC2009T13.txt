Inflation in the 13 countries sharing the euro rose slightly in
March to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent the previous month, the
EU's Eurostat data agency said on Monday, confirming a previous
estimate.


The increase was spot on private economists' forecasts and was in
line with the European Central Bank's preference for an annual
inflation rate of less than but close to two percent.


With economic activity in the eurozone brisk, the ECB is keen to
keep inflation pressures firmly under control and last week sent
a clear signal that it was set to raise its key interest rates in
June.


While headline inflation rose slightly in March, underlying price
growth was unchanged, halting a steady rise in recent months.


Stripping out the impact of energy and unprocessed food, 12-month
consumer price inflation was stable at 1.9 percent in March,
Eurostat said.


In the 27-nation European Union, inflation also rose slightly in
March, edging up to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in February.
