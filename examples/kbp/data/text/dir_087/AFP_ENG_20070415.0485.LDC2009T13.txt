An earthquake that rattled central Japan at the weekend injured
12 people, local officials said Monday.


The 5.4-magnitude quake struck Sunday some 16 kilometres (10
miles) below ground in Mie prefecture, 300 kilometres west of
Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.


Six hours later, another quake with a magnitude of 4.5 hit the
region, the agency said.


Local authorities said a total of 12 people were hurt, but not
seriously, after the first tremor, including a 60-year-old man
hit by part of a falling ceiling.


The quake also temporarily suspended operations at electronics
maker Sharp Corp.'s Kameyama plant, one of the biggest production
bases of liquid crystal displays.


The region also holds key factories of Japanese auto and
electronics makers such as Honda Motor Co. Ltd., Toyota Motor
Corp. and Toshiba Corp., but there was no damage to their
facilities, company officials said.


A meteorological agency official warned of future strong
aftershocks.


Late last month, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9
hit the Noto peninsula in central Japan, killing one person and
injuring more than 200.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and
experiences some 20 percent of the world's most powerful
earthquakes.


In 1995, a 7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe
killed more than 6,400 people.
