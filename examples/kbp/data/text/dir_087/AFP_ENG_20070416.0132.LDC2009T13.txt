A former Hungarian soldier accused of wartime atrocities
committed on behalf of Hitler lost a key battle on Monday in his
legal fight against extradition from Australia.


Charles Zentai, 84, is accused of the abduction, torture and
brutal murder of a teenage boy while serving in his native army,
an ally of Germany during World War II.


The Hungarian government wants Zentai, who moved to Australia in
1950, to face charges in his homeland, with an extradition
hearing scheduled for the Perth Magistrates Court in February.


Zentai's lawyers challenged the decision, claiming only federal
judges could rule in the case, but the full bench of the Federal
Court Monday rejected this plea, opening the way for legal
arguments to start in Perth.


Under Australian law, state magistrates assess extradition
applications from foreign countries before referring them to the
attorney-general or justice minister for a final decision.


Zentai is alleged to have escaped to Germany after the war by
passing himself off as a refugee.
