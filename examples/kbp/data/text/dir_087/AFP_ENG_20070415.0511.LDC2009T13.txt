Five suspected robbers were shot dead in a pre-dawn gunbattle
with Philippine police Monday, police said.


An anti-crime task force unit engaged the suspects in suburban
Quezon city north of Manila. The five, clad in police jackets,
were killed in an ensuing firefight.


There were no casualties on the police side.


An AFP photographer said the suspects appeared to have been shot
at close range.


Police recovered a stolen car and various weapons including a
hand grenade, a shotgun and at least two semi-automatic pistols,
they said.


The government has ordered increased security in Manila and
nearby suburbs after a recent rash of crimes, including
kidnappings for ransom.
