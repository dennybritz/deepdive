Indonesian armed forces chief Marshal Joko Suyanto will visit
Australia as part of moves to strengthen ties between the two
militaries, a report said Monday.


Suyanto will meet his counterpart as well as Prime Minister John
Howard and hold meetings with some of his government ministers
during the two-day visit starting on Wednesday, the state Antara
news agency said.


The meeting with Australian Chief of Defence Forces (Air Chief)
Marshal Allan Grant Houston is expected to follow up on a
cooperation agreement between the two forces signed several years
ago, an official told Antara.


Suyanto is also scheduled to meet Defence Minister Brendan Nelson
and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.


Indonesia's armed forces spokesman could not be immediately
reached to confirm the report and his staff declined to comment.
