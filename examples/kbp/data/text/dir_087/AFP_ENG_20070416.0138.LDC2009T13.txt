England spinner Ashley Giles will be unavailable for the start of
the English county season after the hip injury that has
bedevilled him for the past year flared up again.


The 34-year-old Warwickshire player missed most of 2006 with hip
and groin injuries and this further setback will damage his bid
to force his way back into the England set-up with the first Test
against the West Indies just a month away.


Giles struggled in the opening two Tests of last winter's Ashes
series in Australia before he returned home to be with his sick
wife.


He was then overlooked for the World Cup in the West Indies in
favour of Monty Panesar.


Giles vowed he would battle back to get into the England set-up
although he indicated that it would not be in teh immediate
future.


"I'm heading to Colorado on Tuesday morning to see my specialist
again for further consultation," he told Sky Sports news.


"I've obviously had some pain in the hip and, as he was the guy
who operated on me last time, I've got lots of faith in him and
hopefully he can shed some light on what is going on.''
