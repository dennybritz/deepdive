Turkey's estimated unemployment rate fell to 11.0 percent in the
three months to the end of February from 11.8 percent in the same
period of last year, the State Statistics Institute said on
Monday.


A survey based on interviews of about 90,000 people showed the
number of jobless to have fallen by 124,000 to 2,675,000.


The unemployment rate was estimated at 9.9 percent for the whole
of 2006, down from 10.3 percent in 2005.


High unemployment remains a major challenge for Turkey despite
several years of strong growth.


To determine the jobless rate, the statistics institute surveys
households in different regions of the country and uses the
results to make a nationwide three-month projection.


The figures provide the only unemployment data in Turkey, but
experts say they do not reflect the overall picture because they
exclude undeclared or hidden unemployment, or the employment of
educated, qualified people in menial, unqualified jobs.


However, standard unemployment data in industrialised countries
covers only people registered as unemployed and available for
work.


Unemployment and huge unregistered activity are areas the
International Monetary Fund wants Turkey to address in order to
consolidate its recovery from a severe economic crisis in 2001.
