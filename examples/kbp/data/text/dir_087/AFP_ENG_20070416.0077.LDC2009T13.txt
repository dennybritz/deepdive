President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday vowed in a public speech
that Iran would "resist to the end" in defending its rights over
the country's controversial nuclear drive.


"The Iranian people are standing firm until the end on acquiring
their right and will not shift an inch," Ahmadinejad said in a
speech in the southern city of Shiraz broadcast live on state
television.


"The Iranian nation will not be dissuaded in its drive, and the
Iranian nation stands united on this," he said.


"On the nuclear issue, the Iranian people will stand firm to
acquire all their rights, will continue solidly to reach the
summits of perfection and will raise their fists to insist on
their rights."
