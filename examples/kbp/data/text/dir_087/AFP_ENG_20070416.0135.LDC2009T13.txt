Lufthansa chief executive, Wolfgang Mayrhuber, said on Monday
that buying rival Spanish airline Iberia would be too expensive
for the German flag carrier.


"Speculative prices are not financiable for us," Mayrhuber told
an aviation industry summit here, referring to Iberia's market
value which has soared to 3.7 billion euros (five billion
dollars) amid persistent takeover speculation.


Both Lufhansa and British Airways, which already holds a
10-percent stake in the Spanish airline, have repeatedly been
mooted as possible buyers.


"There is nothing new" on the matter, Mayrhuber said, repeating
Lufthansa's position. Lufthansa was examining all possible
takeover opportunities, but a deal "would have to make sense for
both parties," he said.


The business weekly WirtschaftsWoche, quoting sources close to
the matter, had reported that the Lufthansa chief had set up a
team to examine the possibility of taking over Iberia, with a
decision expected this month.
