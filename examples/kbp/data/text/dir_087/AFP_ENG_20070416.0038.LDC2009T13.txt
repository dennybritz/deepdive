A suicide bomber blew himself up at a police training ground in
northern Afghanistan Monday, killing nine policemen and wounding
25 others, an interior ministry spokesman said.


The attacker, who was on foot, struck at around 9:00 am (0430
GMT) in the relatively peaceful northern city of Kunduz, ministry
spokesman Zemarai Bashary said.


"There was a suicide bombing in front of a police station in
Kunduz," Bashary said.


"Unfortunately nine policemen were martyred and 25 others were
wounded. The bombing coincided with the exercise time of the
policemen," he added.


The blast was the third suicide attack in three days in troubled
Afghanistan.


On Sunday four Afghan employees of a US-owned private security
firm were killed by a motorcycle-riding suicide bomber near a
base housing thousands of international troops in southern
Kandahar city, police said.


Eight people, mostly police, were killed in a blast in the
eastern city of Khost on Saturday.


The Taliban, who were toppled by US-led forces in late 2001, have
launched around 30 suicide bombings this year after pledging a
wave of such attacks against foreign and Afghan security forces
and government targets.


Around 1,000 people, the majority of them insurgents, have been
killed this year in fighting and attacks in Afghanistan, mainly
in the south and east of the country.
