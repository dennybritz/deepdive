Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa said Sunday he would expel the
World Bank's representative in Quito, accusing him of withdrawing
funds in protest over the government's oil sector reforms.


The leftist president said the World Bank official had tried to
blackmail him when he was economy minister in 2005 with a loan of
100 million dollars.


Correa was sworn into office on January 15 to a five-year
presidential term.


"We will expel the World Bank representative from the country
because we are not going to take a bribe from anyone," Correa
said, without naming the official.


The bank's current representative in Ecuador is Eduardo
Somensato.


Correa's announcement came shortly after Ecuadoran voters solidly
approved his plan to form an assembly to rewrite the country's
constitution to promote a socialist agenda.


Correa said his government "is investigating" the World Bank's
cancellation of part of a 100-million-dollar loan that Ecuador
was supposed to have received when he was the finance minister in
the government of Alfredo Palacio.


According to the president, the international body withdrew the
approved loan in retaliation for the Ecuadoran government's
reforms in the oil sector.
