India's Essar group on Monday said it had signed an agreement to
buy Canadian steelmaker Algoma for 1.58 billion dollars to tap
business opportunities in North America.


"Algoma provides us with an excellent platform for the Canadian
and North American markets," Shashi Ruia, chairman of Essar
Global Ltd., said in a joint statement with Algoma.


The deal must be approved by Algoma's shareholders with at least
66 percent of the votes cast in favour.


Essar Global has interests in steel, oil, communications,
shipping and construction.


Ontario-based Algoma, with steel shipments of 2.4 million tons in
2006, is active in a range of specialised steel businesses,
including plate steel for ship building as well as products for
North American car makers such as Ford and General Motors.


Its revenues last year totaled about 1.9 billion Canadian dollars
(1.7 billion US).


Earlier this year, India's Tata Steel bought Anglo-Dutch firm
Corus for 13.7 billion dollars, a move that will make make it the
world's fifth-largest steelmaker.
