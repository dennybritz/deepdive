Japan's industrial output rose by a revised 0.7 percent in
February from the previous month, the government said Monday,
while maintaining its upbeat assessment of the overall economy.


The figure was better than an initial estimate of a decline of
0.2 percent.


Year-on-year output was up 3.1 percent, according to the Ministry
of Economy, Trade and Industry, which said the sharp upgrade was
partly the result of an annual revision to the data for the
period from January last year.


The government also maintained its upbeat view of the economy in
a monthly report, although it slightly downgraded its view on
industrial production.


"The economy is recovering, despite weakness in industrial
production in some sectors," the Cabinet Office said, dropping a
reference in last month's report to weakness in consumer
spending.


The government remained positive about the outlook, saying that
over the short term, "economic recovery is expected to continue,
supported by domestic private demand as high corporate profits
feed into the household sector."


It said that private consumption "is showing a pick-up,"
upgrading its earlier view that private consumption was "almost
flat."


The report indicated that Japan's economy has now been expanding
for 63 months, its longest post-war boom.
