Global crude prices were slightly higher in Asian trade on Monday
as the market fretted about US crude over-supply and a continuing
gap between North American and European prices.


At 11:28 am (0328 am) New York's main oil futures contract, light
sweet crude for delivery in May, was eight cents higher at 63.71
dollars a barrel from 63.63 dollars in late US trades Friday.


Brent North Sea crude for May delivery was at 68.75 dollars a
barrel.


"I think the most important thing is that price difference," said
Dave Ernsberger, Asia director for global energy information
provider, Platts.


"There's no ability to arbitrage that price difference because
there are restrictions on moving that crude out of the US."


Ernsberger said the market is worried about the amount of crude
"just sloshing around" in the United States, which is facing
significant refinery problems.


"There's a real disconnect between, on the one hand, refined
products, and on the other hand, crude oil," he said.


Inventories of US gasoline plunged by 5.5 million barrels to
199.7 million in the week to April 6, the US Department of Energy
reported on Wednesday, as North America gears up for the peak
summer holiday driving season that starts next month.


"At this point, the string of refinery upsets is beyond the
pale," John Kilduff, analyst at Fimat USA, said earlier.


"Our inclination is to believe that this country's refinery
infrastructure is showing its age."


Analysts had also expressed fears of further unrest in Nigeria,
Africa's biggest oil producer, ahead of elections this month.


At least 21 people died over the weekend during state polls ahead
of presidential and general elections next Saturday.
