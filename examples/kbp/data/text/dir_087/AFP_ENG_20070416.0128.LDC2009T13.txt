A Saudi man convicted of raping minors was executed by beheading
in Riyadh on Monday, the interior ministry said in a statement
carried by the official SPA news agency.


Khaled bin Abdullah al-Arjani al-Ajmi was handed down the death
penalty for raping minors and other crimes including theft and
possession and use of drugs, the ministry said.


It added that Ajmi disguised himself as a policeman before
carrying out his crimes.


His execution brought to 33 the number of death sentences carried
out in the kingdom this year.


At least 37 people were executed in 2006, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP counts
based on official statements.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia,
which applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law.
