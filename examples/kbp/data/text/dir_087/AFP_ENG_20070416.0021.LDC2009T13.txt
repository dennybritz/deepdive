Health officials are monitoring around 90 families in two
Indonesian villages for signs of anthrax, which has already
killed five people, an official said Monday.


The deaths forced authorities to seal off the villages on Sumba
island on Saturday and begin mass vaccination of livestock in the
area, veterinary official Maria Geong said.


"At least 90 families in the two isolated villages are suspected
of having been contaminated by the anthrax bacteria," Geong said.


All members of the families had eaten parts of cows and water
buffalo believed to have been infected, she said.


She said they had been asked not to leave their villages until
further notice. Geong did not say how many family members in
total the emergency action affected.


About 2,000 people live in the two villages, which will be sealed
off for a month to stop more people from being infected.


Apart from killing five residents, the disease has forced 12
others to undergo intensive treatment after showing symptoms,
Geong said.


Anthrax is an acute infection that usually only afflicts
livestock but can be transmitted to humans who handle or eat
affected animals.


Geong said a 60-strong team were currently vaccinating 50,000
cows, buffalo, goats and pigs in the area.


Dead and infected animals have already been burnt but any
remnants of their flesh and bones were now being collected to
prevent a further spread of the disease.


The bacteria can survive for more than 60 years, including buried
under five centimetres of soil.


Sumba island is in East Nusa Tenggara province, where some 40
people have died from anthrax since 1994, Geong said.
