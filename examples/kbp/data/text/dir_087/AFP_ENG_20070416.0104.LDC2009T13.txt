Iran has dismissed claims that the US embassy in Tehran will be
sold to pay for damages awarded to an Iranian over his capture 15
years ago by US agents, the media reported on Monday.


Cyprus-based Hossein Alikhani was awarded 550 million dollars
(406 million euros) by a Tehran court in 2003, and said last week
the massive compound had been seized to pay his compensation.


"Based on the international laws, embassies cannot be sold or
confiscated," Reza Jafari, deputy Tehran prosecutor, was quoted
as saying in the centrist Kargozaran newspaper.


"The court can only confiscate property such as cars, bank
accounts, buildings and firms, and cannot pass a verdict on
confiscating embassies as this is contrary to international law,"
he said.


The site of the seizure of embassy staff by revolutionary
militants in 1979, the embassy is now in the possession of the
elite Revolutionary Guards who use it for training and as a "spy"
museum against US "crimes."


The United States cut diplomatic relations with Iran in the wake
of the hostage crisis and ties have remained frozen ever since.


"The selling of embassies would not be good for the country's
image," said Jafari, noting that no such action was taken with
Baghdad's embassy when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980.


Alikhani said that in 1992 undercover US customs agents lured him
to the Bahamas after he was suspected of breaking US sanctions
against Libya, and that he was then held in detention for 130
days.
