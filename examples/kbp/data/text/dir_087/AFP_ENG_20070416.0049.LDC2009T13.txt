Thirteen village officials were killed in southern India Monday
when a train hit their van at an unattended railway crossing, a
report said.


The van driver did not notice the train as he tried to cross the
track, the Press Trust of India quoting police as saying.


The accident took place in the southern most state of Tamil Nadu,
where the officials were on their way to attend a gathering to be
addressed by the chief minister.


The vehicle was carrying around 23 passengers.
