Chinese-brand sedans had a 25.7 percent market share at home in
2006, up more than two percentage points from a year earlier,
despite fierce foreign rivalry, state media said Monday.


Chinese auto makers sold 982,800 sedans, the official Xinhua news
agency reported, citing Jiang Lei, secretary general of the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers.


The latest figure compared with a market share of 23.5 percent in
2005, according to a previous report by Xinhua.


"For many years, Chinese brands were regarded as low-end,
substandard products as many were unreliable. Over the past year,
local brands started moving into the more lucrative high-end
sedan market," Jiang said.


Local brands' market share of all vehicles -- everything from
cars to buses and trucks -- was 57 percent in 2006, the report
said, without providing any comparable figures from earlier
years.


Indigenous brands hold a dominant place in commercial vehicles
like buses and trucks, with their market share hovering around 95
percent for three consecutive years.


Chery Automobile, a mid-sized private car maker, became the first
Chinese auto maker to top the domestic car sales list since 1987
by selling 44,568 vehicles in March, state media reported
earlier.


The figure beat out Shanghai GM, a General Motors joint venture
ranking second with 40,071 units, and 38,627 at Shanghai VW and
37,016 at FAW-VW, two joint ventures of Volkswagen AG.
