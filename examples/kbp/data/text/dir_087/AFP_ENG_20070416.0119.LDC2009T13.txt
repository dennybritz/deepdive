US pop diva Madonna landed at the Kamuzu International Airport in
Malawi's capital Monday with her adopted Malawian son David, an
airport official said.


The official, who requested anonymity, said the singer's
chartered flight landed Monday morning, and two vehicles were
dispatched to the aircraft to block the view of Madonna and her
entourage exiting the plane.


They were immediately whisked away in several vehicles which set
off through the city centre of Lilongwe to check in at an
exclusive lodge near the 100 million- dollar state house.


The owner of the lodge, South African Guy Pickering, confirmed
Madonna had checked in at the lodge, saying: "It's obvious she
was going to stay here. I can't say any more about my client."


While her itinerary during her stay in the country was not know,
it was expected she would continue her charity work of
constructing several orphanages.


David and his biological father were expected to reunite at the
Home of Hope in Mchinji, 110 kilometres (68 miles) from the
capital Lilongwe.


It was there that Madonna chose the then 13-month-old boy from
among 500 children, touching off a heated debate over the
adoption.
