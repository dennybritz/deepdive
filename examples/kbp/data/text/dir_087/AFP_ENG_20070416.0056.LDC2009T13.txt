Oil prices were slightly higher in Asian trade Monday as the
market fretted about a continuing gap between North American and
European prices, dealers said.


At 3:14 pm (0714 GMT) New York's main oil futures contract, light
sweet crude for delivery in May, was three cents higher at 63.67
dollars a barrel from 63.63 dollars in late US trades Friday.


Brent North Sea crude for June delivery was up 12 cents at 68.75
dollars. The May contract expired at the close Friday.


"I think the most important thing is that price difference," said
Dave Ernsberger, Asia director for global energy information
provider, Platts.


"There's no ability to arbitrage that price difference because
there are restrictions on moving that crude out of the US," he
said.


Ernsberger said the market is worried about the amount of crude
"just sloshing around" in the United States, which is facing
significant refinery problems.


"There's a real disconnect between, on the one hand, refined
products, and on the other hand, crude oil," he said.


Inventories of US gasoline (petrol) fell 5.5 million barrels to
199.7 million in the week to April 6 as North America geared up
for the peak summer holiday driving season that starts next
month.


"At this point, the string of refinery upsets is beyond the
pale," John Kilduff, an analyst at Fimat USA, said earlier.


"Our inclination is to believe that this country's refinery
infrastructure is showing its age."


Analysts had also expressed fears of further unrest in Nigeria,
Africa's biggest oil producer.


At least 21 people died over the weekend during state polls ahead
of presidential and general elections next Saturday.
