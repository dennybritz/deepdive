Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa said Sunday he would expel the
World Bank's representative in Quito, accusing him of
"blackmail."


The leftist president said the World Bank official had
blackmailed him when he was economy minister in 2005 with a loan
of 100 million dollars.


Correa was sworn into office on January 15 to a five-year
presidential term.
