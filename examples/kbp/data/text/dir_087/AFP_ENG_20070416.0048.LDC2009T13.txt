Iran on Monday slammed the killing of five Iranian oil tanker
drivers in Iraq, dubbing the attack a beastly and criminal act,
the state news agency IRNA reported.


"Iran strongly condemns the martyring of five Iranian truck
drivers as a beastly, criminal and anti-Islamic act," foreign
ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said.


He said three of the Iranian drivers were Sunni Muslims and the
rest were Shiites.


On Sunday, an Iraqi border guard official said that the bodies of
six tanker drivers, five of them Iranian, had been found one day
after they were ambushed.


Iraqi troops retrieved the bodies near the town of Khanaqin in
the province of Diyala not far from the Iranian border, Brigadier
General Nadhem Mohammed Sharif said.


Insurgents ambushed the drivers on Saturday as they were
importing oil from neighbouring Iran, he said.
