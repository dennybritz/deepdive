An observer team from the west African bloc ECOWAS said
Saturday's state elections were "relatively free and peaceful,"
the News Agency of Nigeria reported Monday.


"The majority of voters were able to cast their ballots in a
tranquil and orderly manner," head of the mission from the
Economic Community of West African States, former Gambian
president Dauda Jawara, was quoted by NAN as saying.


He said the governorship and state assembly elections were an
improvement on the 2003 vote in the country of some 140 million
inhabitants.


Jawara, however, said voting did not start on time in many
centres, while the security of electoral materials was
"compromised"' as they were transported with little or no
escorts.


He said many polling stations were located in unsuitable and
obscure locations, which made it difficult to ensure secret
voting.


He added that the collapsible plastic boxes, which were without
seals and had only zips, were susceptible to abuse and vandalism.


Widespread violence characterised Saturday's vote in which the
head of Nigeria's police, Sunday Ehindero, said at least 21
people were killed.


The country's ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) has won 18
out of the 22 states so far declared by the electoral commission.


The results from 14 states were still not final early Monday.


The 200-strong ECOWAS mission will also observe Nigeria's
presidential and national assembly polls next Saturday.
