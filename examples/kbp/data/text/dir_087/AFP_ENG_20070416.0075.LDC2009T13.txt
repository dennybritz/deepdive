Former Macedonian minister Ljube Boskovski and his bodyguard,
Johan Tarculovski, accused over attacks against ethnic Albanians
in 2001, went on trial before the UN war crimes court here
Monday.


Boskovski and Tarculovski are the first Macedonians to stand
trial before the International Criminal Court for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY) which is mandated to prosecute genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the ex-Yugoslav
territory since 1991.


In his opening statement prosecutor Dan Saxon focused first on
the nature of the conflict in Macedonia. As this is the first
case before the ICTY involving Macedonia the prosecution has to
show there was an international armed conflict at the time of the
indictment, a prerequisite for the prosecution of war crimes.


The prosecution is expected to deal with the charges against the
men later on Monday. According to the indictment Boskovski, 46,
the former minister of the interior, and ex-policeman
Tarculovski, 32, are responsible for atrocities committed against
ethnic Albanians during an uprising in 2001, including the murder
of seven people in the village of Ljuboten in northwestern
Macedonia. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
