Irish pop crooner Ronan Keating is to perform before tens of
thousands of Cambodians next month, organisers said Monday, in
the country's first concert by a major international act.


Some 30,000 Cambodians will attend the gig by the former frontman
of boy band phenomenon Boyzone, said Kevin Kouch, a senior
producer at the Cambodian Television Network which is sponsoring
the concert.


"It's our first time (hosting a headline act) ... It will be a
big success," he told AFP.


Keating's performance will be the highlight of a longer trip
through Cambodia, during which he is expected to visit the Angkor
temples and several orphanages, Kouch said.


Although Cambodia has hosted a number of minor foreign music acts
in recent years, Keating's concert is intended to open the way
for greater international exposure, municipal culture office
official Mom Suth said.


"We hope the group will spread information regarding our culture
and tourist potential to the rest of the world," he said.


Since first hitting the stage with Boyzone in 1994, Keating has
racked up 28 top 10 hits and sold more than 21 million albums
worldwide, according to his website.


His Cambodia concert, to be held in Phnom Penh's Olympic Stadium,
is part of a three-date Asian tour which includes performances in
Bangkok and Taipei.
