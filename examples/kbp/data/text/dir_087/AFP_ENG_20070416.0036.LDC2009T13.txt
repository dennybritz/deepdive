Japanese share prices closed up 1.52 percent on Monday after the
Group of Seven finance ministers made no mention of the weakness
of the yen at their weekend meeting, dealers said.


They said that there had been concern that European ministers
might openly complain about the fall of the Japanese currency,
which is positive for domestic exporters.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 264.35 points to 17,628.30. The broader Nikkei-225 index of
all first-section shares added 20.10 points or 1.18 percent to
1,725.60.
