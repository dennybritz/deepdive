British banking group Barclays and its Dutch counterpart ABN
Amro, which are in exclusive merger talks, have set themselves a
deadline of Wednesday to agree to a deal, the Financial Times
said.


Citing unnamed people familiar with the discussions, the business
daily said that the deadline was imposed after a consortium of
three rival banks approached the Dutch bank about a possible
acquisition, ABN Amro said on Friday.


"It will be deal or no deal on Wednesday," a source familiar with
the matter told the FT.


Royal Bank of Scotland together with Fortis and Banco Santander
invited ABN Amro to "start exploratory talks", the Dutch bank
said last week, adding that it would consider the letter they
sent "carefully."


Meanwhile, the FT quoted a managing partner at The Children's
Investment Fund, which owns nearly 3 percent of ABN shares, as
threatening legal action if ABN Amro's board does not give the
consortium access to the same information that Barclays has
available.


"If other potential bidders are not allowed to do due diligence,
(the board) is in breach of its fiduciary duties," said
Christopher Hohn of TCI.
