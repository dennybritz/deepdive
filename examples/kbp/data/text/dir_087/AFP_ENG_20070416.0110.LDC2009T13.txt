Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said Monday that he was
hopeful that the eurozone economies could withstand the strength
of the euro, which is at record highs against the yen.


Prodi, speaking through an intepreter, told reporters in Tokyo
that he would prefer that the 13-nation single currency did not
"strengthen too much."


But he added: "Europe has so far shown strong flexibility and
endurance" to cope with currency fluctuations.


Prodi said the eurozone economies were finally on the path to
stronger growth and suggested that the rising euro could also
have some benefits.


"It is a fact that an excessively strong euro provokes trade
problems but at the same time it will be a factor to stimulate
Europe's industrial sector," he said, without elaborating.


His comments appeared to reflect the view that a stronger euro
will force European companies to become more competitive through
restructuring.


The euro hit a record high against the yen and a two-year peak
versus the dollar in Asian trade on Monday after Group of Seven
finance ministers refrained from commenting on the weakness of
the Japanese currency.


Dealers said that with the G7 gathering out of the way, the
market was focusing again on prospects for another rise in
eurozone interest rates, possibly in June.


Prodi arrived in Tokyo on Sunday for a three-day visit to Japan
for talks with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe
