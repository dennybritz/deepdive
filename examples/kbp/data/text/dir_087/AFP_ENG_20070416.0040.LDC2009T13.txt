Israel marks Holocaust Remembrance Day on Monday, remembering the
six million Jews who were killed by the Nazis during World War
II.


Sirens will sound across the country at 0700 GMT, bringing
traffic to a halt for two minutes of silence, while the Yad
Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem hosts the annual ceremony
marking the genocide.


In parliament, lawmakers will recite the names of some of those
killed.


In Poland, hundreds of Israelis are due to take part in the so-
called March of the Living at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi German
death camp where some 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were
killed during the war.
