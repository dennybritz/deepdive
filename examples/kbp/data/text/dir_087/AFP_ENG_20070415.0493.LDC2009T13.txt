Japanese share prices jumped 1.67 percent in morning trade Monday
after Group of Seven finance ministers made no mention of the
weakness of the yen at their weekend meeting, dealers said.


They said that there had been concern that the G7 ministers might
discuss the fall of the Japanese currency, which is positive for
domestic exporters. Their silence on the issue pushed the euro to
a record high against the yen.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 290.02 points to 17,653.97 by the lunch break.


The broader Nikkei-225 index of all first-section shares added
21.12 points or 1.24 percent to 1,726.62.
