Gunmen shot dead a civilian in Sri Lanka's restive north in the
latest violence coinciding with traditional New Year
celebrations, police said Monday.


The murder of the 21-year-old man occurred late Sunday in
Ganeshapuram, in Vavuniya district, an area 260 kilometres (162
miles) north of Colombo which is in government territory close to
the frontline with the Tamil Tiger rebel-held north.


Police said authorities were investigating the killing, which
came after six other people were gunned down in the eastern
district of Batticaloa at the weekend.


The defence ministry blamed the Tamil Tigers for the deaths, but
the rebels denied responsibility.


Among those gunned down during the weekend was a member of a
Tamil faction known as the "Karuna Group", which split from the
Tamil Tigers in 2004 and is now allied with government forces,
the defence ministry said.


The majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamil community are
currently marking their common New Year.


At least 4,000 people have been killed between December 2005 and
the first week of March 2007 across the island, including 675
civilians and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence
ministry figures.


The conflict has claimed over 60,000 lives since 1972.
