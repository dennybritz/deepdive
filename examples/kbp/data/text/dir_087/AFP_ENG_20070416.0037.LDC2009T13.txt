Hundreds of villagers in southern Indian Kashmir poured onto the
streets Monday chanting anti-police slogans to protest the death
of two Muslims men in a weekend shoot-out, a witness said.


Police said Monday that the two were killed by suspected
militants Sunday during fighting between rebels and a security
patrol in Kashmir's southern Pulwama district.


However, local residents blamed the police and launched a protest
Monday that shutdown traffic on a main road, a witness said.


"The situation is tense as the residents have blocked one of the
key highways," said Muzaffer Ahmed, a local photojournalist.


Kashmir is in the grip of a 17-year insurgency that has left more
than 42,000 people dead by official count, with as many as 3,000
disappeared.


Human rights groups put the death toll at 70,000 and say the
number of disappeared is closer to 10,000.


Indian police are probing five cases in which innocent civilians
were allegedly killed and passed off as militants that came to
light in early 2007.


Police have charged 17 security force and police members with
murder in two of the cases.
