OPEC is fully committed to ensure continuous supply of oil and
maintain stability in the international crude market, the oil
cartel's president said Monday.


"There should be no doubt that OPEC members are fully committed
to ensure regular supplies to consumers and maintain market
stability," said Mohammad al- Hamli, who is also energy minister
of the United Arab Emirates.


"This has been proven time and again, during crises brought about
by severe weather conditions, geopolitical tensions or disruption
of supplies caused by unrest," he told participants to an oil
conference in Dubai.


But Hamli raised concerns shared among oil-producing countries
over the "need for security of demand" for crude.


"This would greatly strengthen producing countries' resolve to
invest in future capacity expansion. The result would be greater
energy security for all," he said.


Hamli said that the 12-member Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is concerned about policies by consuming countries that
"seek to divert investments away from the oil industry or
discriminate against oil by subsidising competing fuels."


"Producing countries cannot spend precious funds needed elsewhere
on expanding facilities when their customers are telling them
that they intend to reduce dependence on OPEC oil," he added.
