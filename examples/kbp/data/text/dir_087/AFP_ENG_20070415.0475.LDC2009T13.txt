British car brand MG's Chinese owners, Nanjing Auto, are aiming
to raise annual sales levels in Britain and Europe to where they
were before the British brand was liquidated within two years,
its UK head said in an interview published Monday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, Wang Hongbiao also said that the
company was planning to develop a sports car by 2009, which would
eventually give it the opportunity to enter the American market.


"We believe that, with the love and the passion we are putting
into this project, we will be able to make it work," Wang told
the business daily, speaking through an interpreter, though the
paper noted he spoke excellent English.


By 2009, meanwhile, the company will develop "a very good sports
car that would fit in well with the brand ... The next model will
be a possible opportunity to enter the US market."


Wang, 44, also stressed his commitment to its plant in
Longbridge, near Birmingham, central England, where MG Rover cars
were made.


"Longbridge is the core of this product -- this is where the
brand was born," he said, speaking to the FT from the town.


"As long as MG brands exist, Longbridge will always play the
biggest role in the MG project."


Nanjing Auto, which began producing cars in 1947, bought the
rights to the historic cars from the bankrupt MG Rover Group,
once makers of the iconic Mini and Jaguar, in July 2005.


It acquired MG Rover's assembly lines, engine technology and many
of the firm's models, including the MGZR, MGZS and MGZT, for 53
million pounds (103 million dollars) in July 2005 after the
collapse of Britain's last independent carmaker.
