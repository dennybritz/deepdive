Stockholm's stock exchange hit a record high point on Monday,
beating the previous all-time high from March 2000 that occurred
just prior to the collapse of the IT and telecoms bubble.


The OMX Stockholm index rose to 413.83 points at 9:15 am (0715
GMT) in opening trading on Monday, surpassing the previous record
of 413.72 points from March 6, 2000.


The IT and telecoms bubble led to a steady decline on the
Stockholm exchange, with a low of 126.4 points reached on October
9, 2002. Since then, the exchange has climbed by 225 percent.


Since the beginning of 2007, the Stockholm bourse has risen by
10.4 percent.
