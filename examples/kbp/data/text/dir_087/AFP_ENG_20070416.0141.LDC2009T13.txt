Five bodies were found in a minivan in rural Japan after a
suspected suicide pact, Japanese police said Monday.


The three men and two women, believed to be in their 20s,
apparently died from inhaling charcoal fumes -- a common suicide
method here.


Their vehicle was parked on a river bank in Yasu, a town near
Lake Biwa some 350 kilometres (220 miles) west of Tokyo, police
said.


"There were three charcoal burners inside the car. The
circumstances suggested that it was a case of group suicide using
charcoal burners," local police spokesman Takao Higuchi said by
telephone.


"We are yet to ascertain the identities of the dead but a
driver's license was found on one of them," he said. "The river
bank is in the countryside and almost deserted."


In the vehicle, police found a note addressed to family members
which read, "Thank you," Jiji Press reported. The police
spokesman could not immediately confirm the report.


Japan has witnessed a growing number of suicide pacts among
groups of strangers who meet on the Internet. Such people have
often chosen scenic spots to poison themselves with charcoal,
which emits carbon monoxide when burned.


Last month, a 38-year-old man was sentenced to death for
murdering three people with whom he made separate suicide pacts
over the Internet.


Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates.
