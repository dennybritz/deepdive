Japan's industrial output rose by a revised 0.7 percent in
February from the previous month, the government said Monday.


The figure was better than an initial estimate of a decline of
0.2 percent.


Year-on-year output was up 3.1 percent, according to the Ministry
of Economy, Trade and Industry, which said the sharp upgrade was
partly the result of an annual revision to the data for the
period from January last year.


Industrial shipments were steady in February from the previous
month while inventories were down 0.6 percent.
