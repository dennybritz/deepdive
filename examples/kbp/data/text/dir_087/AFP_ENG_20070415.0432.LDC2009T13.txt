A Norwegian oil rig support ship which capsized last week,
killing three members of the 15-strong crew, sank late on Sunday,
the coastguard said.


The Bourbon Dolphin overturned about 75 nautical miles (140
kilometres) west of the remote north Shetlands near the
Transocean Rather oil platform at about 5:00 pm (1600 GMT)
Thursday.


Ten of the 15 people on board were initially rescued but three
were pronounced dead. The search for the missing five was called
off on Friday.


"It was released from a rig yesterday and slowly it began to go
down," Shetland Coastguard watch manager Neil Cumming said.


"It was very unstable and at 9.15 pm (2015 GMT) tonight it sank."


Authorities had hoped that the vessel could be towed back to
shore to look for the five bodies still missing.


Fourteen of the 15 were Norwegian nationals and one was Danish.
It is thought that a man and his 15-year-old son, who was on work
experience from a school in Heroy, west Norway, are among the
missing.


The bodies of the three sailors who died were repatriated to
Norway on Sunday.
