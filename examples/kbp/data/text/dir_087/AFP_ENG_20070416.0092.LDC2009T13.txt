Nigerian stocks rose 2.8 percent last week as the All-Shares
index closed at 45,910.05 points from 44,643,40 the previous
week, dealers said on Monday.


They said the index rose despite the fact that the stock market
opened for only two days because the government declared three
days of public holiday.        On Monday the country celebrated
Easter while Thursday and Friday were meant to enable Nigerian
voters to travel home for Saturday's elections for governorships
and parliament.


Market capitalisation of the 203 listed shares closed higher at
6.6 trillion niara compared with 5.94 trillion recorded for the
preceding week.
