Dirk Nowitzki and Devin Harris each scored 21 points to spark the
Dallas Mavericks past San Antonio 91-86 in a showdown of National
Basketball Association powerhouses here Sunday.


The Mavericks, who had already clinched the league's best record
and a home- court edge throughout the NBA playoffs that begin
next weekend, improved to 66-14.


The Spurs slid to 58-22, still the third-best mark in the NBA and
good enough to secure the third seed in the Western Conference
playoffs behind the Mavericks and Phoenix.


That could make Sunday's matchup a preview of the Western
Conference finals, although the Spurs would have to advance past
the Pacific Division champion Phoenix Suns with Dallas liekly to
meet division winner Utah or 51-win Houston.


French guard Tony Parker scored a game-high 23 points for the
Spurs while Tim Duncan and Argentine playmaker Manu Ginobili each
added 16 points in a losing cause.
