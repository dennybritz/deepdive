German inflation picked up again in March as a result of rising
energy prices, final data showed on Monday.


The German consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent in
March from the figure for February and was 1.9 percent higher
than it had been in March 2006, the federal statistics office
Destatis calculated in a statement.


Inflation in the eurozone's biggest economy therefore accelerated
from the previous month when CPI had risen by 1.6 percent on a
12-month basis.


The statisticians attributed the pick-up in inflation to rising
energy prices, with gas prices rising by 8.5 percent year-on-year
and electricity prices up 6.2 percent.


Using the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), which the
European Central Bank uses as its main inflation yardstick,
German inflation stood at 2.0 percent last month, Destatis said.


The ECB has an inflation target of close to but just below 2.0
percent.
