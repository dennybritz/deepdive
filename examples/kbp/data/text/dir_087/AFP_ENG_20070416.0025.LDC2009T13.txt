Japanese technology giant Toshiba Corp. said Monday that it had
decided to exit the film and DVD production and distribution
business with the sale of its subsidiary Toshiba Entertainment
Inc.


Toshiba said it would sell its fully-owned subsidiary -- which
was created in 2003 -- to the Japanese firm Hakuhodo DY Media
Partners Inc. for an undisclosed sum to focus on its core
electronics and energy operations.


"In its future business in media content, Toshiba will
concentrate resources on network technology, broadcasting and
telecommunication technology, and digital media products that can
create a synergy with fields where the company already has
established strengths," Toshiba said in a statement.


In December, Toshiba announced plans to sell its entire stake in
Japanese label Toshiba EMI to British partner EMI Group, saying
that music was no longer relevant to its business.
