Dwight Howard and the Orlando Magic held on for an 88-86 victory
over Boston on Sunday to clinch their first National Basketball
Association playoff berth in four seasons.


Despite faltering from the free-throw line in the waning moments,
Howard collected 10 points and 14 rebounds, while Hedo Turkoglu
scored 20 points and made two huge defensive stops for Orlando,
who made it to the postseason thanks to their own victory coupled
with Indiana's loss to New Jersey.


Leading, 85-68, with 6:44 left in the fourth quarter, the Magic
let the Celtics right back into the game. Boston went on a 12-0
run to make it 85-80 with 4:10 remaining and eventually cut the
deficit to 87-86 on Al Jefferson's bank shot with 58 seconds
left.


On the next two possessions, Howard made just 1-of-4 free throws,
giving the Celtics a chance to tie or take the lead on the game's
final sequence. After a timeout, Delonte West drove the left
baseline and misfired on a floater as time expired.


However, replays showed the Boston guard was smacked in the back
of the head by Turkoglu on the drive, sending West sprawling to
the floor. No foul was called, and Celtics coach Doc Rivers left
the court jawing at the referees.
