A suicide bomber blew himself up at a police training ground in
northern Afghanistan Monday, killing nine policemen and wounding
25 others, an interior ministry spokesman said.


The attacker, who was on foot, struck at around 9:00 am (0430
GMT) in the relatively peaceful northern city of Kunduz, ministry
spokesman Zemarai Bashary said.


"There was a suicide bombing in front of a police station.
Unfortunately nine policemen were martyred and 25 others were
wounded. The bombing coincided with the exercise time of the
policemen," Bashary said.
