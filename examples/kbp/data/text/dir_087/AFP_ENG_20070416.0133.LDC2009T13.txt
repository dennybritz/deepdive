Scrum-half Sean Long has announced that he will no longer play
internationally for Great Britian.


The 30-year-old St Helens player, who controversially quit the
2006 Tri-Nations Series for personal reasons on the eve of the
Lions' final group game in Brisbane, says he wants to concentrate
on his club football.


"I've made my mind up and just want to do my best for St Helens
now,'' Long told the May edition of Rugby League World magazine.


"If I can have a couple of full pre-seasons from now on, then I
might get another season or two our of myself at the end of my
career.


"I've got to listen to my body now and there are too many games
in a year for someone to keep playing internationals and expect
to be right for the following Super League season."


Britain play their first match under new coach Tony Smith against
France in June before meeting New Zealand in the autumn.


Meanwhile, New Zealand's veteran scrum-half Stacey Jones has also
ruled himself out of the autumn Test series.


The Catalans Dragons captain has twice come out of retirement to
help the Kiwis reach the Tri-Nations final over the last two
years but insists any call from coach Brian McClennan would fall
on deaf ears this time.


``I told Brian that I've retired,'' he said.
