A consortium headed by Irish investment group Quinlan Private
said on Monday it had bought 47 Marriott hotels in Britain from
the Royal Bank of Scotland for about 1.1 billion pounds.


The transaction, equivalent to 1.6 billion euros or 2.2 billion
dollars, has now completed, according to a consortium statement.


British bank RBS had bought the portfolio of Marriott hotels,
which are operated by US-based group Marriott International, from
leisure company Whitbread for 951.4 million pounds in April last
year.


The investment consortium also includes Igal Ahouvi, the Israeli
property investor, as well as Electra Real Estate, International
First Bank of Israel and Delek Real Estate.
