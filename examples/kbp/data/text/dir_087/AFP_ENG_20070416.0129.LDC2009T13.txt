Journalists staged a protest in Beirut on Monday calling for the
release of Alan Johnston, a BBC reporter kidnapped in the Gaza
Strip where a Palestinian group has claimed to have killed him.


Dozens of journalists, Lebanese and foreign, gathered in front of
the Lebanese press syndicate headquarters, carrying pictures of
Johnston with the March 12 date of his kidnapping in Gaza.


"We call on those who are holding him to release him
immediately," BBC reporter in Beirut Nada Abdel Samad said during
the protest.


"Our colleague continued to work professionally despite being
aware of the dangers" of covering news in the increasingly
lawless Palestinian territory, she added.


The secretary general of media rights watchdog Reporters Sans
Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders), Robert Menard, attended
the protest.


On Sunday, a Palestinian group called the Kataeb al-Jihad al-
Tawheed (The Brigades of Holy War and Unity) said it had
"executed" 44-year-old Johnston, who was abducted at gunpoint
five weeks ago in Gaza City.


There has been no independent verification of the claim.


Journalists in Beirut were also planning a similar protest later
on Monday for Sudanese Sami al-Haj of the Arab satellite channel
Al-Jazeera, who was arrested by the Pakistani army on the Afghan
border in December 2001 and has been held without charge at the
US naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba since June 2002.
