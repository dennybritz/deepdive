France Telecom said on Monday it had bought 51 percent of
Bahrain-based telecommunications operator Lightspeed
Communications.


The French operator said in a statement it had made the
acquisition via its majority-owned Jordanian subsidiary, Jordan
Telecom Group.


"This acquisition fits fully in with France Telecom group's
development strategy in the Middle East where it is already
present in Jordan and Egypt with 12 million clients," the
statement said.


No financial details were disclosed.


Lightspeed Communications specialises in Internet services and
was the first operator to launch a double-play service in
Bahrain.
