Retail sales in China during the May 1 "Golden Week" holiday
totalled 320 billion yuan (42 billion dollars), an increase of
15.5 percent from the same week a year ago, the government said
Monday.


Retail sales in the catering sector were up 17 percent over the
same period, the ministry of commerce said in a statement on its
website.


The ministry did not say how it had arrived at the figure even
though the seven- day holiday was not completely over.


China introduced three annual "Golden Weeks" in 1999, also
including the traditional Spring Festival early in the year and
the October 1 National Day holiday.


The purpose was to lift the economy at a time when it was reeling
from the impact of the Asian financial crisis.


With an economy that has now seen four consecutive years of
double-digit economic growth, this is no longer urgent.


However, the "Golden Weeks" still help boost consumption, so it
can account for a larger share of growth, alongside net exports
and investment.
