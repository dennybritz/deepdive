The European Commission raised on Monday its forecast for German
growth this year, projecting that the biggest economy in Europe
would expand 2.5 percent, up sharply from a February estimate of
1.8 percent.


The forecast makes the European Union's executive arm even more
optimistic than the German government, which raised its 2007
growth forecast to 2.3 percent last month.


The Commission forecast that growth in the German economy would
slow only marginally next year to 2.4 percent as several lean
years at the beginning of the decade recede into the past.
