Airbus Industrie Monday confirmed plans to invest one billion
dollars in India in the next decade as its superjumbo Airbus A380
arrived to raise the profile of its only customer in the country.


The aircraft flew a maiden trip to New Delhi Sunday to mark the
second anniversary of private domestic carrier Kingfisher
Airlines, the only Indian airline and among 16 airlines globally
to have ordered the plane from the European manufacturer.


Airbus will invest "one billion dollars in the next 10 years" in
India for training, maintenance and a design centre, John Leahy,
chief operating officer for customers at European-based Airbus
Industrie, told reporters in New Delhi.


In February Airbus said in the southern city of Bangalore that it
would invest one billion dollars in the country during the next
decade, but Leahy's confirmation comes as the airline pursues
massive cost-cutting linked to low demand and production delays
of the giant passenger jet.


Kingfisher Airlines, owned by Indian distiller UB group, ordered
five A380s in 2005 among 15 planes in a deal worth about three
billion dollars.


It expects the first delivery of the aircraft in 2011 as it draws
up plans for an international debut, using the A380 -- which has
been much delayed in production -- on high-density routes such as
to the United States.


Air travel in India has soared in the past five years as almost a
dozen new airlines have been launched to serve demand in the
fast-expanding economy.
