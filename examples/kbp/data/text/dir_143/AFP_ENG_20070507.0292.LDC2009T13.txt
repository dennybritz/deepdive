A UN conference on climate change opened in the German city of
Bonn on Monday in a bid to tie countries such as the United
States and China into a new accord on greenhouse emissions.


The meeting gathers more than 200 government officials and
experts and is meant to pave the way for a new pact to replace
the Kyoto Protocol on harmful emissions.


Kyoto binds 35 nations and expires in 2012.


The delegates are expected to mull ways to bring more countries
into a new agreement, notably nations like China, India and the
United States that have snubbed Kyoto.


The new protocol is meant to be thrashed out at the next major
environmental meeting in December on the Indonesian island of
Bali.


The Bonn conference is the first UN meeting of its kind since the
world body published a series of damning reports this year about
the dangers of global warming.


The latest, published in Bangkok last Friday, concluded that
efforts to stabilise the level of greenhouse gases over the next
20 to 30 years will be crucial in the fight against the
phenomenon that is threatening the planet with environmental and
economic disaster.


The conference runs until May 18.
