The head of Russia's strategic missile forces on Monday
threatened an "adequate response" if a planned US anti-missile
defence system is deployed in eastern Europe, Interfax news
agency reported.


"If the US does take the decision... then the Strategic Rocket
Forces can take adequate measures to offset the threat that could
arise for the Russian Federation," General Nikolai Solovtsov was
quoted as saying.


Russia has "serious concern" over the US plan to base a limited
anti-missile shield in the Czech Republic and Poland, the three
star general added.


Moscow, which has been increasingly vocal in its public criticism
of US policy in recent weeks, says the shield poses a strategic
threat by undermining its own missile deterrence capabilities.


Washington says the anti-missile shield, which would not be
operational before 2012, is designed to shoot down ballistic
missiles, possibly tipped with nuclear weapons, that could in the
future be fired by Iran or other "rogue states."


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the proposed European
base would be far too limited in size and capability to affect
Russia's massive ballistic missile arsenal.
