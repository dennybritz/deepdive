AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam Monday expressed confidence that
security at the Asian Cup finals would be sufficient after a bomb
blast in Bangkok at the weekend.


The finals in July are co-hosted by Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand
and Vietnam.


A small bomb went off in the Thai capital on Saturday injuring
one man and followed a series of blasts in Bangkok on New Years
Eve.


The Indonesian capital Jakarta has also been the target of
terrorist attacks in recent years.


But bin Hammam said he was convinced the authorities in all four
host nations would have the tightest security possible for Asia's
flagship football competition from July 7-29.


"The security of all participants is primary to us but these
things are happening in many areas of the world. You cannot
prevent it, it is just like any other disease," he said on the
sidelines of the Asian Football Confederation congress here.


"But definitely among our plans and our agreements with national
governments is that security in the stadiums, for the teams and
at the hotels must be very high.


"Frankly speaking I don't feel any threat to the competition."


He added that despite the logistical complications of holding the
event in four countries, preparations were going well.


"The Asian Cup preparations are going very well and the
organisers have cleared up all our doubts," he said.


"We don't have any issues, particularly concerning the main
stadiums, although there are very minor issues on the secondary
stadiums.


"I think the AFC and the national federations have lifted
themselves up to the standards the fans expect."
