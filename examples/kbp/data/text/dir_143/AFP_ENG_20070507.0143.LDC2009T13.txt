The European Commission lifted on Monday its 2007 growth estimate
for the 13 nations sharing the euro to 2.6 percent from a
February forecast of 2.4 percent on expectations of strong German
performance.


The forecast means that the eurozone, long the laggard of major
economic powers, would be the fastest growing economy in the
developed world, with the US growth estimated at 2.2 percent and
Japan at 2.3 percent.


It would also mark only a marginal slowdown from 2006, when the
eurozone grew 2.7 percent -- its fastest pace of growth since the
peak of the dot.com bubble at the turn of the decade.
