A small fire broke out Monday in the gas and condensates manifold
at Kuwait's Burgan oilfield, the largest in the oil-rich emirate,
injuring one worker, an official statement said.


Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) spokesman Ali al-Shimmari told the
state-run KUNA news agency that "the fire was put out in record
time after insulating the manifold and reducing gas pressure."


Shimmari said the incident will have no impact on the production
of oil or natural gas.


The manifold is part of a gas pipeline that brings associated
natural gas from Kuwait's northern oilfields to a gas
liquefaction plant in southern Kuwait.


The spokesman said that gas supplies to the plant will be
slightly affected as the company will operate an alternative
network to pump the gas.


One worker was hospitalised with burns, Shimmari said, adding
that KOC was investigating the cause of the fire.


Burgan oilfield, south of Kuwait City, produces around 70 percent
of Kuwait's total output of around 2.4 million barrels per day
(bpd). It is the world's second largest after Saudi Arabia's
Ghawar.


KOC is the exploration and production arm of the national oil
conglomerate Kuwait Petroleum Corp.


Kuwait sits on about 10 percent of the world's crude reserves.
