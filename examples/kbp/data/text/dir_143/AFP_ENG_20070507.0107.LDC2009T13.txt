German sportswear manufacturer Puma, a takeover target for French
luxury goods empire PPR, said on Monday it had revised downwards
its forecasts for 2007 after a disappointing first quarter.


Puma said it now expected sales to rise from between one and five
percent, having previously forecast five to 10 percent.


The world's third-largest sportswear maker said profit in the
first quarter was up 3.7 percent year-on-year to 96.6 million
euros on turnover that showed a two percent rise to 655.8 million
euros.


Operating profit was up two percent to 135 million euros.


Puma said its revised 2007 forecasts were based on "the situation
at the end of March and investments planned this year."


The results will be closely watched because PPR is to announce a
full takeover bid for the company on May 15 worth a total of 5.3
billion euros after already agreeing to buy a 27-percent stake.


Many analysts believe the offer undervalues Puma.


Puma, which lags behind Nike and Adidas in the global stakes,
said that in a year without a major sporting event, it was
launching a range inspired by 1970s tennis players.
