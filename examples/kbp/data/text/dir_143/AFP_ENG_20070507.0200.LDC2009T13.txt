Taiwanese authorities said Monday that they are suspending
imports of apples from Chile after a codling moth lava was found
in a shipment.


The larva -- which can do extensive damage to apples and pears --
was found Friday in a shipment of four containers of apples to
the northern Keelung harbour, said Chang Shih-yang, an official
with the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection.


"The Chilean government has been asked not to ship apples to
Taiwan before quarantine measures are improved," he said.


Chile is Taiwan's second largest apple supplier, next only to the
United States.


Taiwan imported 117,715 tonnes of apples last year, 39,954 tonnes
from Chile.
