A three-man team of Cameroon referees were among those who died
when a Kenyan Airways plane crashed in swampland near here
Saturday with 114 people on board.


Cameroon football officials said Zing Omgba, Engelbert Effa and
Patrice Boungani boarded the flight in this Atlantic city en
route to the Democratic Republic of Congo via Kenya.


The match officials were due to control an African Confederation
Cup fourth round fixture between Tout Puissant Mazembe Englebert
of DR Congo and Mwana Africa of Zimbabwe.


An African Football Confederation spokesman said in Cairo that
replacement referees from Congo Brazzaville were rushed to
Kinshasa and the match went ahead as scheduled on Sunday.


Rescue workers found no one alive when they reached the wreckage
of the Boeing 737-800 36 hours after the plane had gone missing
soon after taking   off during a violent storm.
