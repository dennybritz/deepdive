The head of a Swiss regional bank resigned on Monday after
admitting errors in helping a Russian businessman acquire a major
stake in Swiss engineering group Sulzer, the bank said in a
statement.


Hans Voegeli will step down as the chief executive officer of the
Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB) earlier than planned, on May 31, the
bank said.


He will be replaced by Martin Scholl.


The bank said that Voegeli "accepts full responsibility for the
mistakes made at various levels over the deals involving shares
in Sulzer".


"The transactions in the Sulzer case contravened the bank's
internal guidelines," the ZKB said.


Russian industrial and metals giant Renova Group announced last
month that it was buying a holding totalling about 32 percent in
Sulzer for an undisclosed amount.


The asset management group controlled by Russian billionaire
Viktor Vekselberg said "it is acquiring a position" in Sulzer
amounting to about 18 percent of Sulzer shares and an additional
14 percent in the form of "physical delivery options."


Vekselberg recently transferred his residence to Switzerland and
was rated as the third-richest person in the country by a Swiss
business magazine, Bilan in 2006, with a fortune evaluated at 14
to 15 billion Swiss francs.


ZKB said it hopes to retain its leading position in derivatives
trading, but will introduce new safeguards for options trading.


Voegeli's resignation follows the dismissal of Markus Hoffman,
ZKB's director of trading and capital markets.
