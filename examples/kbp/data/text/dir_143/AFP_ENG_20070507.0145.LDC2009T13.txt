A former provincial minister and leader of ex-prime minister
Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party was shot dead along with
a relative in northwest Pakistan, police said Monday.


Syed Qamar Abbas, 52, and his nephew were killed by unidentified
gunmen in a passing car in Peshawar late Sunday, senior police
official Iftikhar Ahmad told reporters.


The pair were returning from a wedding reception on a motorcycle,
Ahmad said.


Abbas had served as a provincial minister in Bhutto's governments
from 1988-1990 and 1993-1996.


Police ruled out that the killings were linked to sectarian
violence or the recent wave of terrorist attacks in the province.


"It is not a case of sectarian killing or terrorism," Ahmad said,
adding that Abbas had made enemies in his career.


Hundreds of Abbas' supporters surrounded the local police station
and blocked the main road, chanting slogans against the
government to protest the killing, witnesses said.
