The number of confirmed dead from a gas explosion in a north
China coal mine has risen to 28, with two still missing, state
media said Monday.


The toll increased as rescue workers, struggling against dense
smoke that still filled the mine, hauled out eight more bodies
from the Pudeng Coal Mine in Shanxi province, the Xinhua news
agency reported.


A total of 125 miners were underground when the explosion ripped
through the mine Saturday afternoon. Ninety-five escaped, but 23
of them were injured, one seriously, according to Xinhua.


The agency quoted the provincial work safety watchdog as saying
the coal mine had earlier been ordered to suspend production, but
mine operators had resumed production Friday without a permit.


"The coal mine was in a mess and under poor management," it said,
according to Xinhua. Local police were investigating two of the
mine's managers, it added.


China's coal miners typically labour under appalling conditions
as many mine owners cut corners on safety to maximise production
of the country's most important energy source.


More than 4,700 workers were killed last year, according to
official figures, but independent labour groups put the death
toll at up to 20,000 annually.
