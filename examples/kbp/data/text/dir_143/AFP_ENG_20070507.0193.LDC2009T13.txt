Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Monday urged Israel to
respond favourably to a proposed US security plan despite its
rejection by his senior coalition partner Hamas.


"We think that there are important steps in this plan to
stabilise security and end the suffering of our people," Abbas
told a meeting of his Fatah party in Gaza. "We ask Israel to
respond favourably to this plan."
