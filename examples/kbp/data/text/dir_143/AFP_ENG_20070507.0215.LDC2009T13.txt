Former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed arrived
back in Dhaka on Monday, an official said, after a failed attempt
by the military-backed government to exile her.


The head of the Awami League party, who led the country from
1996-2001, returned amid tight security.


"She arrived safely on an Etihad Airways flight at about 4:40 pm
(10:40 GMT), said airport security officer M.A. Awal.
