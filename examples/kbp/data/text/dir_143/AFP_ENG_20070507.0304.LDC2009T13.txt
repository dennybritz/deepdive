An Al-Qaeada allied Islamic militant group on Monday claimed
responsibility for an attack in Iraq which killed a Russian
journalist and six American soldiers.


The so-called "Islamic State of Iraq" -- a front for Al-Qaeda in
Iraq -- said in an Internet statement that it carried out the
roadside bomb attack in Diyala province on Sunday.


"God allowed soldiers from the Islamic State to pass judgement on
American crusader forces in the city of Baquba in Diyala
province... where a powerful bomb exploded next to a crusader
vehicle... leading to its total destruction," the statement said.


Dmitry Chebotayev, 29, was a Moscow-based freelance photographer
who was working in Iraq for the Russian edition of Newsweek
magazine.
