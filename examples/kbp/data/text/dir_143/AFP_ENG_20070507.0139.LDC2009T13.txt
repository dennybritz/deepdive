Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas on Monday said it respected
the choice of the French in electing right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy
as president and said it hoped he would work with their unity
cabinet.


"The French elections are an internal matter," Hamas spokesman
Fawzi Barhum told AFP. "The French people have chosen and we
respect this choice."


"The position of France toward the Palestinian people, their
cause and that of Arabs has always been good, from Francois
Mitterand to Jacques Chirac," he said, referring to the two
presidents who preceded Sarkozy.


"We hope that this change will lead to cooperation with the
national unity government and that Sarkozy will contribute to
lifting the siege against the Palestinian people and support
their legitimate rights," he said.


He was referring to a ban on direct aid that the European Union
and the United States imposed on the Palestinian government after
Hamas, considered a terror group by the EU and the US, formed a
cabinet alone in March 2006.


Hamas formed a unity coalition with president Mahmud Abbas's
secular Fatah party on March 17 hoping to end the boycott, but
the EU and US have so far refused to do so, demanding that the
new government explicitly recognise Israel, renounce violence and
agree to abide by past peace deals.


Earlier Israeli officials and press welcomed Sarkozy's election,
hailing him as a friend of the Jewish state.
