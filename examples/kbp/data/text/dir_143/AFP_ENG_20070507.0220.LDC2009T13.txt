Local authorities in a Russian region bordering Estonia are to
erect a World War II memorial at the frontier in answer to the
controversial relocation of a Soviet-era statue in the Estonian
capital Tallinn, a parliament deputy said Monday.


Vitaly Yuzhilin, who represents the Russian constituency
adjoining Estonia, said foundations for the memorial would be
laid on Wednesday in the Russian border town of Ivangorod during
annual World War II commemorations.


Yuzhilin accused Estonia of "defiling" soldiers' graves beneath
the Bronze Soldier memorial during the transfer last month from
the centre of the Estonian capital to a military cemetery.


The new memorial would be situated by the River Narva, which
divides Ivangorod from the Estonian city of Narva, he said in a
statement.


Russians see the Tallinn monument as commemorating defeat of Nazi
Germany, but many Estonians say the sculpture is a reminder of
brutal Soviet occupation that followed.
