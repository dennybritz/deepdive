The Jordanian parliament has voted a bill to fight money
laundering and protect the national economy, newspapers and the
state-run Petra news agency reported Monday.


The 110-elected lower house passed the bill on Sunday and sent it
to the  the 55-seat upper house appointed by the king for its
approval, Petra said.


"The lower house approved the law after scrapping articles
related to terrorism and terror funding because they were
stipulated in other laws, including the anti-terror law," passed
in August 2006, it said.


The bill "seeks to preserve the banking system and protect the
national economy," the agency said.


Veteran economist Fahed Fanek said the bill was also part of the
"global fight against terrorism" and aimed at making Jordan "part
of the international movement against money laundering."


But he told AFP he did not think Jordan was "affected by money
laundering."


In line with the new bill, a commission will be formed to draw
policies on combatting money laundering and facilitate the
exchange of intelligence with other countries, the press
reported.


Manufacturing and smuggling arms as well as the trade in
narcotics are considered crimes under the draft legislation, the
reports said.


The bill is the latest in a series of laws adopted by parliament
after the 2005 suicide attacks against Amman hotels that killed
60 people.


In December, Jordan hosted a UN-sponsored conference to fight
corruption, including money laundering.
