The DAX index in Frankfurt was slightly up in early trading on
Monday, and dealers said it was unaffected by the victory of
right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy in the French presidential election.


At 0825 GMT, the DAX was trading up 0.06 percent to 7,521.37
points having risen by 1.9 percent overall last week.


One trader said Sarkozy's victory over the Socialist candidate
Segolene Royal on Sunday had "absolutely no influence on
trading."


The London markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday.


Among major movers in Frankfurt was chemical group Altana which
surged up 6.52 percent to 21.09 euros.


Altana, which sold its drugs unit in December, saw sharp
variations in its price last week as it came into the sights of
speculators.


Shares in Puma, the world's number three sportswear manufacturer,
were down 0.33 percent to 334.89 euros after it lowered its 2007
forecasts on the back of worse-than-expected results in the first
quarter.


The German group, which is the subject of a takeover bid by
French luxury goods empire PPR, said it now expected sales this
year to rise from between one and five percent, having previously
forecast five to 10 percent.


"This profit warning is a surprise," a trader said.


Puma's rival Adidas also slipped, showing a loss of 0.33 percent
to 42.16 euros.
