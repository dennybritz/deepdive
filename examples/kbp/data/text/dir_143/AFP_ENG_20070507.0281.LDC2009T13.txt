Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Monday congratulated Nicolas
Sarkozy on his win in France's presidential election, saying he
hoped relations between the countries would become even stronger.


"France is Afghanistan's best friend and it has made significant
contributions to security and reconstruction efforts in
Afghanistan during the past five years," Karzai said in a
statement.


"I hope the historic and friendly relations between Afghanistan
and France will further strengthen under Sarkozy's leadership."


France has about 1,000 soldiers as part of the 37-nation
International Security Assistance Force that is led by NATO and
is trying to help the fragile government establish some authority
over the resurgent Taliban movement.


The extremist group, which is holding a French aid worker
hostage, has urged the president-elect to set "an exact
timetable" for the withdrawal of French troops.


It says it will release the Frenchman if the troops are withdrawn
or the Afghan government frees certain Taliban militants in its
jails.
