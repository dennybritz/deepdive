Syria's parliament on Monday re-elected Mahmud al-Abrash as
speaker during its first session following an April election that
also saw MPs sworn into office.


Sole candidate Abrash was voted in by 235 out of 244 MPs present,
according to a parliamentary source. Rodwan Habib was elected
deputy speaker, also as the only candidate.


MPs also took their oath of office, swearing on the Bible or the
Koran depending on their faith.


Syria's ruling National Progressive Front, which is dominated by
the Baath party of President Bashar al-Assad, won 172 seats in
last month's election.


The other 78 seats up for grabs went to independents amid a
boycott by the only tolerated opposition bloc.


The front has won every election since its formation in 1973. The
Baath party has ruled Syria under a state of emergency since it
seized power in 1963.


A referendum on granting Assad another seven-year term is due to
be held in coming weeks.
