No survivors have been found in and around the wreckage of a
Kenya Airways plane that crashed in a swamp in Cameroon with 114
people aboard, a government official confirmed Monday.


"There are no chances of finding any under the circumstances,"
Douala prosecutor Luc Ndjodo told AFP, adding that rescue workers
had begun to recover the bodies of the victims.


He said that at the scene the wreckage of the Boeing 737-800 was
scarcely visible at first sight.


"There is a crater filled with water and a clearing, then buried
in the mud there are scattered plane parts and debris," Ndjodo
said.


Earlier a relief worker, who declined to be identified, told AFP,
"There are only dead, no survivors."


"There are many mutilated bodies buried in the mud," he added.


The wreckage of the six-month-old airliner, which carried 105
passengers of various nationalities and nine Kenyan crew was
found on Sunday in swampland some 20 kilometres (12 miles)
southwest of the city of Douala.


It had vanished from radar screens in a violent storm shortly
after taking off from Douala en route to Nairobi.
