A 75-year-old Greek man has been arrested for killing and
chopping up his wife 11 years ago, police said on Monday.


The unnamed man is suspected of pushing his wife into an air
shaft on their house roof, cutting her up with a meat cleaver and
disposing of her body in seven different garbage bags, police
said.


Three years later, he claimed the 56-year-old woman had
disappeared and arranged to receive her health benefits and
manage her fortune.


Police would periodically question the man on the disappearance
claim, and this week found inconsistencies in his testimony,
whereupon they arrested him.


The suspect insists his wife's death was an accident, his lawyer
said.


"It was a family quarrel, the woman fell and was mortally hurt,"
Aristeidis Fatouros told reporters.


"My client is crushed over the incident," he said. "He confessed
because he could not bear the guilt...but he did not want to be
accused of murder."


Family fights account for the majority of violent crime in
Greece. The victims are usually women.
