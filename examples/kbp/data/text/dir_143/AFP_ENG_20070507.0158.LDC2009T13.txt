Japanese mobile phone giant NTT DoCoMo said Monday it had
cancelled a contract with Indian operator Hutchison Essar to
provide its "i-mode" mobile Internet service in India.


DoCoMo's move followed the Indian government approval late last
month of British Vodafone Group PLC's plan to buy Hutchison
Essar.


DoCoMo and Hutchison Essar signed an agreement last December on
the licensing of the "i-mode" mobile Internet service in India by
the end of 2007.


"Due to the changes in business environment, both companies
concluded that it would be difficult to launch i-mode service at
this time and agreed not to proceed," DoCoMo said in a press
release.
