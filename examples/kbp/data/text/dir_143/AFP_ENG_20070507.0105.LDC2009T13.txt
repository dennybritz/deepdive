Russia's foreign minister on Monday accused the European Union
and NATO of "conniving" in attempts to rewrite the history of
Russia's contribution to World War II.


Laying a wreath at a monument to diplomats killed in the war,
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov vowed to defend the memory of the
Red Army's triumph over fascism.


"The memory of the victory will not fade. This memory is sacred
for us and we cannot but be riled by the attempts to blaspheme
this memory, abusing it and rewriting history," RIA Novosti news
agency cited Lavrov as saying.


"Unfortunately several organizations, like NATO and the EU, are
conniving to do so," he said.


Russia, which celebrates its defeat of Nazi Germany on Wednesday,
has accused other former Soviet republics of recasting the
victory as the start of the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe.


Moscow reacted furiously last week after Estonian authorities
relocated a memorial to Soviet soldiers in central Tallinn, and
condemned the European Union for not reprimanding Estonia.


Russia and the EU are due to hold a summit in the southern
Russian city of Samara on May 17-18.
