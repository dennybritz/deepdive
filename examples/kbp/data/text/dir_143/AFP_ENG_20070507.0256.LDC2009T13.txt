Indian police said Monday they are taking steps to seize property
from acclaimed Indian painter M.F. Hussain after he failed to
appear in an obscenity case.


"Preliminary steps have begun to attach his property following
the Haridwar court order," Brijesh Singh, Mumbai deputy police
commissioner said.


The court in North India issued the order after the 91-year old
-- known for large canvasses that have fetched millions of
dollars at auction -- failed to appear in a 2005 case lodged over
two paintings depicting semi-nude Hindu deities.


Hussain's lawyer says he plans to ask India's Supreme Court to
review the merits of the case.


"My client will await the Supreme Court decision," lawyer Akhil
Sibal told AFP.


Hussain, a Muslim, painted "Bharat Mata" (Mother India) and
"Krishna" (a major Hindu deity) that were auctioned to aid Indian
victims of a 2005 South Asian earthquake that left thousands dead
in Himalayan Kashmir.


Several activists and right-wing Hindu fundamentalists have, in
recent years, objected to other Hussain paintings.


Hussain has stayed in Dubai and London for the past year and has
labelled the cases as unfortunate.
