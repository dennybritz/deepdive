Italy's centre-left prime minister Romano Prodi said Monday he
liked Nicolas Sarkozy's open-minded character, adding that
Franco-Italian ties would likely strengthen under the next French
president.


"He has a character that I like a lot. With Sarkozy it is
possible to hold open and clear discussions ... We have worked
very, very well together," Prodi told a press conference in Rome.


If Sarkozy carries through on his pledge to focus on Europe
during his five-year term as president, the "ties between Italy
and France, which have always been very good, will become
stronger," Prodi said.


The Italian prime minister acknowledged that he and Sarkozy did
not always see eye to eye politically.


"I am from the centre-left, he is from the centre-righ, but our
personal relationship is very good. I don't think political
differences will ruin our friendship," he said.


Sarkozy, who scored an emphatic 53-47 percent victory over
Socialist leader Segolene Royal in Sunday's presidential
elections will take over the French presidency from his former
mentor, Jacques Chirac, on May 16.
