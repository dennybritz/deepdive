Industrial orders in Germany went up in March by 2.4 percent from
the February level, according to unofficial seasonally adjusted
figures published on Monday.


Analysts polled by the Thomson Financial agency had expected a
month-on-month rise of just 0.9 percent.


"It is a particularly strong rise for a month of March," the
economy ministry said in a statement.


The figures were the latest positive sign from the German
economy, the biggest in the eurozone.


The European Commission on Monday raised its forecast for German
growth this year to 2.5 percent, up sharply from a February
estimate of 1.8 percent.


That was even more optimistic than the German government's own
2007 forecast of 2.3 percent.
