German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday she had spoken to
French president- elect Nicolas Sarkozy about maintaining the
French-German relationship at the heart of Europe.


"We spoke about continuing the cooperation between Germany and
France and intensifying it," she said.


Merkel said she spoke by telephone to her fellow conservative,
who defeated Socialist candidate Segolene Royal convincingly on
Sunday, to congratulate him on his "great election victory."


"I wished Nicolas Sarkozy all the best and much success with his
task. I think we will work together very well."


The partnership between France and Germany has often been
described as the "motor" of the EU and was given high priority by
outgoing French President Jacques Chirac.


Germany is keen to assure that the relationship remains a driving
force within Europe. Berlin is expected to be one of the first
foreign visits that Sarkozy makes. Germany holds the EU
presidency until the end of June.
