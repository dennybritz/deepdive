Norwegians are slowly warming to EU membership with 40 percent
now in favour of joining the bloc, though eurosceptics remain a
majority, a poll published on Monday showed.


Some 40.1 percent say Norway should join the European Union,
while 47.5 percent remain negative towards membership and 12.4
percent are undecided, according to the study.


In a similar poll carried out in March only 37.3 percent of
Norwegians were in favour of joining the bloc of 27 countries
while 52.3 percent were opposed.


The wealthy Scandinavian nation -- it has more than 1,844 billion
kroner (227 billion euros, 308 billion dollars) placed in a state
pension fund thanks to its vast oil and gas revenues -- has twice
voted against EU membership, in 1972 and 1994.


A new referendum is unlikely in the near future as the right-wing
coalition government is divided on the matter.


The study by the Sentio polling institute, in which 1,000 people
were interviewed, was carried out between April 24 and 30 and
commissioned by three newspapers.
