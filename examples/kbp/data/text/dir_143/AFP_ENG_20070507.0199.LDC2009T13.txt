None of the 114 people aboard a Kenya Airways plane that crashed
in a swamp in Cameroon survived, a rescue worker who reached the
scene said Monday.


"There are only dead, no survivors," the relief worker, who
declined, to be identified, told AFP.


"There are many mutilated bodies buried in the mud," he added.


A Kenya Airways official earlier said that there was practically
no chance of anyone being left alive after the crash on Friday
night.


He said that an airline employee who had reached the scene saw
that the nose of the airliner was half-buried and remains of the
tail section were scattered over about a kilometre.


The wreckage of the six-months-old Boeing 737-800, which carried
105 passengers of various nationalities and nine Kenyan crew was
found on Sunday in swampland some 20 kilometres (12 miles)
southwest of the city of Douala.


It had vanished from radar screens in a violent storm shortly
after taking off from Douala en route to Nairobi.
