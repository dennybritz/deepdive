North Queensland skipper Johnathan Thurston sparked a 24-10
victory over competition newcomers Gold Coast Monday to move to
outright third in Australia's National Rugby League.


Thurston set up his team's three tries and kicked six goals to
decisively win his battle with opposite number Scott Prince.


Test incumbent Thurston has a mortgage on the Queensland
scrumhalf spot for this month's State of Origin series opener
against NSW in Brisbane ahead of Prince.


Dual international Mat Rogers was easily the Titans' best player,
scoring a brace of tries to keep the home side in the hunt after
they had trailed 16-4 at halftime.


The Cowboys can now claim bragging rights over their Queensland
rivals after defeating champions Brisbane Broncos in round one.
