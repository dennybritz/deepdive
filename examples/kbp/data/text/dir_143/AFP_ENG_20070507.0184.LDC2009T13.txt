Saudi Arabia beheaded by the sword on Monday two Thai nationals
convicted of drug trafficking, the interior ministry said in a
statement carried by the official SPA news agency.


The ministry said the two men were executed in the eastern city
of Dammam for smuggling a "large quantity of hashish" into the
kingdom hidden inside sporting equipment.


The latest beheadings brings to 55 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in Saudi Arabia,
which applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law. Rape,
murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can all
carry the death penalty.
