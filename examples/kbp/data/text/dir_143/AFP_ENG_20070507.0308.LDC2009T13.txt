Syrian President Bashar al-Assad congratulated Nicolas Sarkozy
Monday on his victory in French presidential elections and said
he hoped the incoming head of state would oversee an improvement
in relations.


Outgoing President Jacques Chirac was a close friend of
billionaire Lebanese former premier Rafiq Hariri, who was killed
in a 2005 bombing widely blamed on Syria, and has strongly
resisted any opening to Damascus.


"President Bashar al-Assad congratulated Mr Nicolas Sarkozy on
his election victory" and expressed hope that "relations between
the two countries would develop more," the official SANA news
agency said.


The editor of government daily Ath-Thawra, Khalaf al-Jarad, said
Syria was hoping that the new president would avoid the sort of
personal animosity towards it he said Chirac had displayed.


"We are expecting Mr Sarkozy to reevaluate relations between
France and Syria which have been strained over the past two years
because of the prejudiced views of the outgoing president towards
Syria," Jarad told AFP.


"We are hoping for relations based on objectivity and not the
sort of personal animosity that characterised the Chirac era."


France froze all high-level contacts with Syria following
Hariri's assassination and also long resisted any move by the
European Union to hold similar contacts.
