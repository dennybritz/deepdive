The Greek coast guard on Monday intercepted 38 clandestine
immigrants in two separate operations in the west and southeast
of the country, the merchant marine ministry said.


Twenty-four migrants, including 10 women and two children, were
found by a coast guard vessel on the shores of Farmakonisi island
after being deposited there by a speedboat from the neighbouring
Turkish coast, the ministry said.


Another 14 migrants were found hidden on a bus at Igoumenitsa, a
port in western Greece that handles commercial traffic with
Italy.


Greece lies on a major people-smuggling route to Western Europe,
and intercepts dozens of clandestine migrants trying to enter the
country by land and sea every month.
