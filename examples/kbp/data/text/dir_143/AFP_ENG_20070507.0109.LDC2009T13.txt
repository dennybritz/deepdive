Hong Kong share prices closed up 0.27 percent for another record
close Monday, led by gains in China-related stocks although
stocks pulled back after breaking the 21,000 points level,
dealers said.


The market came off the day's highs as property stocks saw some
profit-taking in late trade after an early advance driven by
expectations of strong bids at a government land auction Tuesday.


China stocks managed to sustain their gains on hopes that
mainland bourses will rise further when they resume trade Tuesday
after the May Day holidays.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 55.56 points at a new
closing high of 20,896.64.
