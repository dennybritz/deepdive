A homemade explosive device went off overnight at a synagogue in
Russia's Saratov province, causing minor damage but no injuries,
Russian news agencies reported Monday.


"No one was hurt, but a window was broken by the shock wave,"
local police in the Volga River region were quoted as saying by
RIA Novosti and Interfax.


Last November, the Russian Federation of Jewish Communities
called on the authorities to increase security at synagogues in
response to an increase in racist attacks.
