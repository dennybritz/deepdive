A Russian headmaster was fined Monday for illegally installing
Microsoft Windows on his school's computers in the country's
first prosecution for usage of pirated goods, Russian media
reported.


Alexander Ponosov was found guilty of illegally using the
operating system by a court in the region of Perm in the Ural
mountains and fined 5,000 rubles (194 dollars, 143 euros).


Pirated goods are still widely available and used in Russia
despite tough new legislation to protect intellectual property
rights approved as part of Moscow's bid to join the World Trade
Organisation (WTO).


"He was found guilty of inflicting material damage against
Microsoft of 266,000 rubles and was fined 5,000 rubles," the RIA
Novosti news agency cited presiding judge Valentina Tiunova as
saying.


Ponosov said he did not know that the software was pirated and
his campaign attracted high-profile support, including from
Russian officials and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.


Asked about the case at a press conference in February, Russian
President Vladimir Putin said: "Catching someone just because he
bought a computer and threatening him with prison -- that's
crap."


Ponosov, who had faced a maximum of five years in prison under
new laws in Russia, told RIA Novosti that he would appeal. An
earlier case against Ponosov was thrown out due to the minimal
damage inflicted on Microsoft.
