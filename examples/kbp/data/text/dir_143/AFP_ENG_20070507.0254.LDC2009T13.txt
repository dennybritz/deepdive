Liberia has cancelled all year-end final examinations written
across the country last week over test paper leakages, a move the
country's vice president berated as a disgrace.


Head of the country's examinations body, Eli Lumei, announced
over the weekend that senior high school tests thousands of
pupils sat for last week  were nullified due to suspected
widespread malpractices and corruption.


"This is a disgrace to the school system in our country to see
national exams being cancelled for acts of corruption and
cheating," Vice President Joseph Boakai told Liberia public
broadcaster ELBC radio.


At least 14,000 children are affected by the scrapping of the
exams, according to an education source.


"This is not healthy for the education in Liberia. You see
cheating and all kinds of fraud in the school system," said
Boakai in a country trying to re- build its infrastructure
ravaged by a 14-year civil war.


Lumei said the west African country's national security had
instituted a probe into the matter and that new tests would have
to be written at dates yet to be fixed.


Minister of Education Joseph Korto had earlier last week
complained about rumours that workers from the country's West
African Examinations Council (WAEC) circulated test papers a day
before the examinations started.


Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has since she became
head of state in January last year vowed to drastically crack
down on corruption and improper deals.
