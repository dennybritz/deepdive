Six people died and another was seriously hurt early Monday when
a recovery vehicle carrying a minibus collided with the back of a
lorry on a motorway in southern England, police said.


Police said the six passengers from the broken down minibus had
all transferred to the cab of the recovery vehicle before the
2:15 am (0115 GMT) accident on the M25 motorway in Surrey, south
of London.


"The driver of the HGV (lorry) has not been injured and is
helping Surrey Police with their inquiries" as they try to
determine the cause of the accident, a police statement said.


A spokeswoman for Surrey Ambulance Service said one man, who had
been with the minibus group, is in hospital with serious
injuries.
