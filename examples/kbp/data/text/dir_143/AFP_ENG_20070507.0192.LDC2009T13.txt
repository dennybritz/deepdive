Two Hong Kong women were treated in hospital after they suffered
suspected stings from scorpions lurking in imported fruit, health
officials said Monday.


The two women, one aged 64 and the other 32, suffered swollen
fingers and inflammation after being stung on the hand as they
ate a tropical grape-like fruit known as longsat.


Both said they found scorpions in the bags they were eating from.


They were treated by doctors and released from hospital care.


Longsats are not grown in Hong Kong are usually imported from
Southeast Asia. Similarly, scorpions are not native to Hong Kong
and find their way here hidden among imported foodstuffs.
