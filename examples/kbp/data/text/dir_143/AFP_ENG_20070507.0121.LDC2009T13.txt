A pair of suicide car bombs exploded Monday in the restive
western Iraqi city of Ramadi claiming 20 lives, said Colonel
Tareq al-Dulaimi, a senior security official from Al-Anbar
province.


"Ten were killed in each explosion and both were from suicide car
bombs," said Dulaimi, the head of internal security in the area.


The first bomb exploded in a popular market just north of the
provincial capital, he added, while the second exploded 15
minutes later targeting cars queuing up at a police checkpoint
two kilometres (one miles) away.


The double bombing came as Al-Anbar province was being
increasingly vaunted as a success story for the Iraqi government
and its US allies in restoring peace to the war-torn country.


An alliance of tribal leaders is working with US forces against
the Al-Qaeda-led insurgents, resulting in a dramatic drop in
violent incidents in the past few months.


Al-Qaeda, however, has responded with a spate of bomb attacks.
