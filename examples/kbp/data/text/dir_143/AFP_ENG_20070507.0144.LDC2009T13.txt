A French military probe into the deadly crash of an aircraft
carrying peacekeepers in Egypt's northern Sinai region is to
begin work on Tuesday, French officials said.


"The commission from the defence ministry's air accidents
investigation bureau will arrive late Monday," an official
speaking on condition of anonymity told AFP.


The panel consisting of around 15 experts will then fly from
Cairo to the northern Sinai base of the Multinational Force and
Observers (MFO) in Al-Gurah to start their inquiry.


Nine MFO personnel, eight French and one Canadian, were killed
when their small transport plane crashed in central Sinai on
Sunday.


The French official said the bodies were not to be repatriated
before the end of the investigation, which is expected to last at
least three days.


According to Egyptian security officials, the pilots reported a
technical failure which forced them to attempt an emergency
landing on a road.


The small Twin Otter aircraft had one of its wings clipped by a
truck carrying large containers before eventually crashing into
the side of a hill, the sources and witnesses said.


An Egyptian aviation official suggested the crash may have been
caused by the pilot's failure to respect minimum flight
altitudes.


The crash caused the heaviest casualties ever suffered by the MFO
since it was established in the Sinai peninsula to monitor
security provisions of the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and
Egypt.
