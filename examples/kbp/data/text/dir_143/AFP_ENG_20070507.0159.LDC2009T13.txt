AFC supremo Mohamed bin Hammam Monday hailed Australia's
contribution to Asian football since dumping Oceania, saying it
had proved a win-win situation.


Australia jumped ship from Oceania to the Asian Football
Confederation in January 2006, giving them an easier qualifying
route into the World Cup and also allowing them to compete in
Asia's premier football event, the Asian Cup.


"They have brought a lot to Asia -- image and reputation for our
competitions," said bin Hammam on the sidelines of the AFC
Congress here.


"They have brought more sponsors and television revenues. They
have also brought a high level of football."


Kuwait has led calls in parts of the Arab world for Australia to
be thrown out of the AFC, saying it was a big mistake to admit
them in the first place.


But bin Hammam said they were mistaken.


"Maybe one voice has been raised against Australia but not all
Arab countries. At the AFC Congress, when we voted for Australia
to be part of Asia the 45 nations voted yes," he said.


"Australia are now enjoying a high standard of competition and it
is a win-win situation."
