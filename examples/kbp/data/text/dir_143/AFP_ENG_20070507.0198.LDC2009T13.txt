A journalist killed along with six coalition soldiers by a blast
in Iraq on Sunday was a Russian news photographer, the Russian
ambassador to Baghdad said Monday.


"His death was confirmed this morning.... It's Dmitry
Chebotayev," Vladimir Chamov, Russia's ambassador to Baghdad,
told state-owned news channel Vesti.


Chebotayev, 29, was a Moscow-based freelance photographer who was
working in Iraq for the Russian edition of Newsweek magazine. He
had also worked for European Pressphoto Agency (EPA).


Chebotayev and six soldiers from the US coalition died as a
result of injuries sustained when their vehicle was attacked by a
roadside bomb in Diyala Province, a military statement said.
