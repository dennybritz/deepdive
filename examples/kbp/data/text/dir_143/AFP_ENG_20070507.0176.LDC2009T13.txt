A Palestinian was killed and four wounded during clashes between
rival factions in Lebanon's main refugee camp of Ein el-Helweh on
Monday, a Palestinian security source told AFP.


The dead man was identified as Abu Omar, from the secular Fatah
movement of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who was allegedly
killed by a rival from the Islamist Jund ash-Sham movement who
was himself wounded when an argument degenerated into gunfire,
the source said.


Three Palestinian women were also wounded by stray bullets, the
source said.


The atmosphere in the camp was reportedly tense following the
shooting, with schools and shops shuttered amid fears partisans
from both sides could pursue the conflict.


Ein el-Helweh, 45 kilometres (30 miles) south of Beirut, is the
largest of Lebanon's 12 refugee camps and home to 47,000
Palestinians or their descendants who fled or were forced from
their homes when Israel was created in 1948.
