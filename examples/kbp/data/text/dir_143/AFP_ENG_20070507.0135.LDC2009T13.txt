Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday he hoped
French presidential winner Nicolas Sarkozy would soften his
staunch opposition to Turkey's bid to join the European Union
after he takes office.


"We have to respect the decision of the French people," Erdogan
told journalists here, Anatolia news agency reported.


"We hope we will not see in our bilateral relations from now on
the same attitudes that Sarkozy displayed during his election
campaign regarding our European Union (accession) process and
Turkish-French ties," he said.


Asked whether Sarkozy's policies could have a negative impact on
Turkey's already turbulent membership talks, Erdogan said: "I
don't know. We will see his practices from now on."


Sarkozy is staunchly opposed to Turkey joining the 27-member
bloc, arguing that most of Turkey's territory in Asia and that
the idea of united Europe would be diluted if its borders stretch
that far.


He advocates a "privileged partnership" between the EU and Turkey
rather than full membership for the sizeable mainly Muslim
nation.


Outgoing French President Jacques Chirac was a firm supporter of
Turkey's membership aspirations.


Ankara lost another of its main backers in 2005 when Angela
Merkel, who also calls for a "privileged partnership" with
Turkey, defeated Gerhard Schroeder to became German chancellor.
