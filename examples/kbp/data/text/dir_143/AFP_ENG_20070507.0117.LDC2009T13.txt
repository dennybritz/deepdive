A pair of suicide car bombs exploded Monday in the restive
western Iraqi city of Ramadi claiming 20 lives, said Colonel
Tareq al-Dulaimi, a senior security official from Al-Anbar
province.


"Ten were killed in each explosion and both were from suicide car
bombs," said Dulaimi, the head of internal security in the area.


The first bomb exploded in a popular market just north of the
provincial capital, he added, while the second exploded 15
minutes later targeting cars queuing up at a police checkpoint
two kilometres (one miles) away.
