The European Commission on Monday upgraded its forecast for
French economic growth this year to 2.4 percent with a slight dip
to 2.3 percent forecast for 2008.


The 2007 figure, published in a semi-annual update of its
European growth forecasts, was up on an earlier interim estimate
of 2.2 percent issued in February by the EU's executive arm.


Despite the improved outlook, the French figures lag behind the
the average for the 13 nations which use the euro currency, where
growth was estimated at 2.6 percent for this year and 2.5 percent
for 2008.


France's unemployment rate, though remaining high, was estimated
to fall from 9.4 percent in 2006 to 8.9 percent this year and
keep easing to 8.5 percent in 2008.


The French economy outperformed targets in the first two
quarters, French Economy Minister Thierry Breton said on Monday,
only hours after the victory of rightwing reformist Nicolas
Sarkozy in the presidential election.


Sarkozy campaigned on a platform of radical reforms to free-up
the economy, ratcheting up some measures already being tried by
the centre-right government of which he was a rebel member until
recently.


Breton said that growth of the economy in the first and second
quarters would be "revised upwards" to "between 2.5 and 3.0
percent" on a 12-month basis.
