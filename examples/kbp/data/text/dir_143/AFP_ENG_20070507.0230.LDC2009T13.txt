Oil major Chevron said Monday it had temporarily shut down its
Ebite flow station in southern Nigeria because of a community
protest.


"It is true that some villagers protested at our Ebite facility.
For safety and security reasons, we have had to shut down
production till the situation is resolved", Femi Odunmalo, a
Chevron spokesman, said.


He said 42,000 barrels of crude per day are affected.


Industry sources said the villagers, who wielded machetes and
sticks, were protesting what they said were delays in
compensation for an oil spill.


Odunmalo said the reason for the protest was yet to be
determined.


"The reason for their anger is not clear yet because they have
representatives through whom we dialogue. Leaders of the
community are very cooperative with us and they have already
intervevened. We hope to resolve this very soon," he said.


The Niger Delta, a swathe of creeks and swamps and the size of
Scotland, is home to Nigeria's multi-billion dollar oil and gas
industry.


The region has seen a resurgence in violent attacks on oil firms
and personnel over the past two years.


Chevron produces 360,000 barrels of crude per day in Nigeria
according to its spokesmen here.
