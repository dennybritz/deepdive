Top central bankers said on Monday that the world economy was
continuing to grow at a strong and "very encouraging" pace,
European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet said.


Trichet said after a regular meeting of the G10 group of central
bankers here that financial markets had confirmed their
resilience by absorbing recent turbulence.


"We confirm that global growth is very encouraging, we are full
in line with what we have expressed at the last IMF meeting and
the last meeting here in Basel," he told journalists at the Bank
for International Settlements.


The European Central Bank chief said there was "confirmation of a
very strong growth at a global level in volume."


Trichet reiterated warnings about downside risks including oil
and commodity prices following volatility in those markets in
recent years


"Let's continue to be fully aware about the risks," Trichet said,
warning against complacency, especially over the risk of
inflation.


"Price stability is necessary for a global growth," Trichet
underlined.
