The European Commission on Monday upgraded its forecast for
Britain's economic growth this year to 2.8 percent although the
rate is expected to fall slightly in 2008.


In a semi-annual update of its European growth forecasts, the
EU's executive arm put estimated British growth last year also at
2.8 percent. This year's forecast of 2.8 percent is slightly up
on a February estimate of 2.7 percent.


In 2008 the rate is forecast to drop to 2.5 percent.


The British unemployment rate is forecast at 5.0 percent this
year and 4.9 percent in 2008 on inflation of 2.3 percent in 2007
and 2.0 percent next year.


The extimates come after Britain's Office for National Statistics
estimated the economy expanded by 0.7 percent in the first
quarter of 2007 compared with the last three months of 2006,
aided by a strong services sector.
