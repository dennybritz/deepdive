The European Commmission on Monday welcomed an investigation that
led to the dismissal of two deputy ministers in Bulgaria's
centre-left government, but said it hoped this was not just a
one-off case.


"The Commission welcomes the fact that the prime minister and the
chief prosecutor's office have conducted this in such an open and
transparent way," a spokesman told reporters in Brussels.


The two deputy ministers were dismissed Saturday while Economy
and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov was also told to take leave.
All three are implicated in Bulgaria's first corruption probe to
involve senior government officials.


Bulgaria joined the European Union in January but is being
watched closely by the European Commission, the EU's executive
arm, because of its slowness in reforming the judiciary and its
failure to curb crime and corruption.


"We would want to underline that, while high-level cases are
important, what we are looking for is a change of the system,"
the spokesman said.


"The Bulgarian authorities are aware of what they need to do. We
will monitor that situation. We will report in June," he added.
