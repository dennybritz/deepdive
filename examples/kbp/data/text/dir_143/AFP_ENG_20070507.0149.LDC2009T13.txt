The European aircraft maker Airbus said on Monday that Emirates
airline of Dubai had ordered four extra A380 superjumbo jets,
confirming a previous order for 43 of the giant aircraft despite
production delays.


The new order is worth 1.22 billion dollars (904 million euros)
at catalogue prices.


The first of the A380 airliners is to be delivered to Emirates in
the first quarter of 2008, Airbus said.


The United Arab Emirates airline, having ordered a total of 47 of
the superjumbo airliners is the biggest customer for the
aircraft.


The A380 is at the heart of a crisis in Airbus owing to delays in
production of up to two years.
