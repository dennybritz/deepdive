German President Horst Koehler on Monday rejected a plea from a
leader of the notorious Red Army Faction guerrilla group to be
released from jail after 24 years behind bars.


"The president has refrained from issuing clemency for Christian
Klar," Koehler's office said.


Klar, 54, was jailed in 1983 for multiple murders, including the
assassination of federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback.


Buback became the first victim of a bloody period dubbed the
"German Autumn" when he was shot in his Mercedes car by RAF
gunmen on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe in
1977.


Buback's son Michael told a German newspaper recently that he had
reliable information from those connected to the now-disbanded
group that Klar was not involved in the murder of his father.


The RAF, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang after its original
leaders Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, mounted a violent
campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist
state of West Germany from 1977 to 1982.


It targeted the German elite and the US military based in West
Germany and is suspected of killing 34 people. The group
officially disbanded in 1998.


Brigitte Mohnhaupt, who led the RAF with Klar after the group's
original leaders committed suicide in jail, was released from
prison in March after serving 24 years for her role in nine
murders, including Buback's.


Justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society.
