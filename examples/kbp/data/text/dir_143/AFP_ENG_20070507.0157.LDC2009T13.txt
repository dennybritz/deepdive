Sri Lanka believes Adam Gilchrist's use of a squash ball as a
batting aid in the World Cup final was "unethical" and may take
the matter up with world cricket chiefs, officials said Monday.


Gilchrist, whose record-breaking 149 led Australia to their
fourth title, said later that he had a squash ball in one of his
gloves to give him a better grip.


"I had a squash ball in my bottom-hand to help with my grip in
training and I decided in this World Cup to use it in a match,"
he said.


The revelation caused uproar here, with Sri Lanka Cricket
secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan saying the matter could be taken
up during next month's International Cricket Council (ICC) annual
general meeting.


"We are of the opinion that it was unethical for Gilchrist to use
a squash ball to give unfair advantage," Mathivanan told AFP.


He said Sri Lanka could call on the ICC's cricket committee for
stringent application of "Law 42" on fair and unfair play to
ensure only the approved protection equipment was used.


Mathivanan said Sri Lanka Cricket would discuss the issue before
deciding whether to raise it in London.


Sri Lankan newspapers have carried letters from irate fans
accusing the Australians of resorting to unfair tactics to win
the game.


"The question now asked by most Sri Lankan fans is whether the
squash ball was used as a performance enhancing device," said The
Island, a privately-owned newspaper.


Fans say the use of the ball gave Gilchrist, who had a poor run
leading to the final, an extra edge over Sri Lanka's bowlers.
