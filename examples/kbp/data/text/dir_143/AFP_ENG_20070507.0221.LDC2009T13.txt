A man who shot dead two US troops outside a high-security jail on
the outskirts of Kabul was an Afghan soldier hospitalised twice
for mental illness, the defence ministry said Monday.


Ministry spokesman General Mohammad Zahir Azimi dismissed a
reported claim by a man identifying himself as a Taliban
commander that Sunday's attacker was from the insurgent movement.


"They are lying. This is not true," Azimi told AFP.


"Our initial investigations show that the ANA soldier who opened
fire and killed two US nationals and wounded another two was
hospitalised twice at the military hospital for mental illness,"
he said.


"After he was discharged from the hospital, it was believed he
was cured completely and was considered healthy."


The attacker, among a group of soldiers guarding the Pul-i-Charki
jail, was shot dead by his colleagues after shooting the US
troops as they were driving away from the prison.


The investigation was continuing, Azimi said. "We offer our
condolences to the family of the victims and the defence ministry
of the United States," he said.


The US-led coalition said late Sunday that its first reports
suggested the attacker was a rogue soldier, but this was under
investigation.


The soldiers attacked were mentors to the prison's personnel,
coalition spokesman Major Sheldon Smith said. The jail houses
criminals, Taliban and Al- Qaeda fighters.


The US-led coalition, which led the offensive into Afghanistan
that toppled the Taliban regime in 2001, has troops embedded with
local security forces.
