Pakistan's Supreme Court on Monday suspended a judicial inquiry
into misconduct charges against the country's top judge that
triggered weeks of nationwide protests.


The court ordered the move, a decision likely to embarrass
President Pervez Musharraf's government, as it took up a petition
from Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry challenging his
suspension from office.
