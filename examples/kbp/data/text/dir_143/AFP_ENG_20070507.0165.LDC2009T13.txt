Former Zimbabwe wicketkeeper Andy Flower is to be Peter Moores
new assistant coach with the England national side in place of
Matthew Maynard.


The 39-year-old Flower has been playing for Essex but announced
his retirement from playing in order to take up the position
which follows on from his work as a batting coach with the
academy.


Moores said: "Andy will bring to the support staff a wealth of
international experience as well as a clear understanding of the
domestic game in England and Wales.


"I am sure all the players will respond to his style and enjoy
working with him."


Moores took over from Duncan Fletcher as England coach following
the disappointing performance from the English at the World Cup
in the Caribbean where they failed to reach the semi-finals.


Flower scored 16,379 first-class runs at an average of 54.05
including 4794 runs at 51.54 in 63 Tests. He also claimed 160
victims behind the stumps.


"From my time working with Peter at the academy, I know that we
shall work very well together and I am excited about entering
into this new challenge of coaching an international team."
