Newcastle United confirmed on Monday that coach Glenn Roeder has
resigned and the club has started the search for his successor.


The 51-year-old former defender ended his 15 months in charge on
Sunday one day after the 0-2 home loss to Blackburn Rovers in the
Premiership, but there was no official confirmation until Monday.


A statement issued through the club's website said: "Newcastle
United today announced that Glenn Roeder has offered his
resignation as team manager with immediate effect and this has
been accepted by the Newcastle United board."


The loss to Blackburn had left Newcastle languishing in 13th
position in the Premiership and they have not scored a goal at
home for over eight hours, their worst run since 1951.


Speculation has been rife that Roeder will be succeeded by former
Bolton manager Sam Allardyce who turned down the Newcastle job
before Graeme Souness, Roeder's predecessor, was offered it in
2004.


Allardyce resigned as Wanderers boss a week ago after seven-
and-a-half years at the helm amid rumours he could also be
appointed Manchester City boss in the summer.
