A rocket fired by Gaza militants into southern Israel on Monday
morning struck near a nursery school in the town of Sderot but
caused no injuries, the Israeli army and media reported.


"A Palestinian rocket fired from the Gaza Strip fell Monday into
the courtyard of a home in Sderot but did not cause any
injuries," the army said in a statement. Radio reported that the
rocket fell near a nursery school.


In Gaza, the radical Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility
for the strike.


The attack came a day after another rocket attack by Islamic
Jihad moderately wounded one person in the Israeli southern town
of Sderot.


Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned that the Jewish state
would eventually react against the rocket fire.


"The Qassam (rocket) attacks constitute a real threat against
Israel," his office quoted him as telling visiting German Foreign
Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. "Israel will not be able to
hold back forever."


Olmert "emphasised that Israel will react harshly to the ongoing
rocket fire which threatens the lives of the residents in the
western Negev," the statement said.


Islamic Jihad was not party to a November truce under which
Israeli troops pulled out of Gaza in return for a commitment from
militant groups to end rocket fire from the territory.


Despite violations by both sides, the truce has largely held. The
Israeli army says some 250 rockets have been fired into Israel
since the ceasefire, most of them landing without causing
injuries or damage.
