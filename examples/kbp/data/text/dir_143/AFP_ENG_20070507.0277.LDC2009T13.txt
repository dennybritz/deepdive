A landmine blew up a minibus Monday killing four civilians on
board and wounding another seven in eastern Afghanistan, police
said.


The minibus ran over a landmine about five kilometres from
Mehtarlam, the capital of Laghman province, deputy police chief
Najeeb Hottak said.


"Four civilians were killed and another seven were wounded as a
result of the blast," he said, adding women and children were
among the dead and wounded. Hottak blamed the attack on the
"enemies of peace and stability", a term Afghan officials often
use to refer to Taliban extremists.


"We don't know what was the target, but unfortunately the
civilian vehicle drove over the mine," he said, adding police
discovered and removed another landmine Sunday on the same road.


Meanwhile, in southeastern Khost province a man and his nephew
were shot dead in Gurbuz district, police said, adding one of the
victims was an Afghan militia soldier with the US-led coalition
forces.


Police spokesman Wazir Badshah said two Pakistani nationals were
arrested in relation to the incident and later confessed they had
carried out the attack.


South and southeastern Afghanistan have seen much of the Taliban-
led violence since the collapse of the ultra-Islamic regime in
late 2001.
