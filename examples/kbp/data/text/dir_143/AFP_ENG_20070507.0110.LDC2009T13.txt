Manchester City's Michael Ball is under investigation by the
English Football Association (FA) for stamping on Manchester
United winger Cristiano Ronaldo and a disciplinary hearing is
likely to take place on Thursday.


FA disciplinary chiefs will examine television footage of the
incident which occurred during Saturday's derby game and the City
defender looks set to be charged.


An FA spokesman told the Press Association: "We will look at the
television footage of the incidents tomorrow and ask the
officials what action they would have taken had they seen the
incidents, and any charges will be based on that."


In the event of charges being levelled, Ball will have until
Wednesday to respond and under the fast-track system a
disciplinary hearing would take place on Thursday.


Officials from the FA's compliance department will also have to
decide whether the player should be charged with violent conduct
or the more-serious offence of serious foul play.


That was the charge brought against Ben Thatcher earlier this
season after his elbow assault on Portsmouth's Pedro Mendes while
the defender was playing for Manchester City. He was suspended
for eight matches by the FA.


An apparent headbutt by Fulham's Michael Brown on Liverpool's
Xabi Alonso will also be investigated on Tuesday.
