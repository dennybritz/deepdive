Sri Lanka has restricted domestic flights and banned amphibious
aircraft from using irrigation reservoirs following Tamil Tiger
air attacks, officials said Monday.


The military banned Sri Lanka's national carrier, Sri Lankan
Airlines, from operating a lucrative domestic service of Single
Otter aircraft using reservoirs for take-off and landing, a
defence ministry official said.


The move was part of measures taken by the security forces to
deal with the new threat of air attacks by Tamil Tiger rebels who
demonstrated their air capability in March by using light
aircraft to bomb targets here.


Foreign tourists were using the air-taxi service to travel to a
golf course and upmarket hill resorts, instead of travelling on
the highly congested local roads.


Sri Lanka has already announced the closure of its only
international airport starting Thursday for six hours each night
after four daring night time bombing raids by the Tigers.
