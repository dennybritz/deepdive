Between 100 and 200 Iranian dissidents protested in Stockholm on
Monday against a visit to Sweden by Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki.


Protesters threw eggs at the door of the Swedish Institute of
International Affairs where Mottaki was due to deliver a speech,
and shouted slogans denouncing the Iranian regime.


The group also called for the release of political prisoners.


A large police force was on hand to prevent the demonstrators
from entering the building.


Mottaki was scheduled to meet with Swedish Foreign Minister Carl
Bildt and Deputy Prime Minister Maud Olofsson later on Monday.
