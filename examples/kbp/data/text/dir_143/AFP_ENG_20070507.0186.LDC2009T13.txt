Pakistan's Supreme Court on Monday suspended a judicial inquiry
into misconduct charges against the country's top judge that
triggered weeks of nationwide protests.


The court ordered the move, a decision likely to embarrass
President Pervez Musharraf's government, as it took up a petition
from Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry challenging his
suspension from office.


Musharraf suspended Chaudhry on March 9 on allegations of
misconduct and abuse of authority, sparking a wave of massive
protests by opposition parties and lawyers who branded it an
attack on the independence of the judiciary.


The misconduct allegations were being investigated by the Supreme
Judicial Council (SJC), a panel of five senior judges, but
Chaudhry argued that it was not competent to try him.


"The SJC proceedings have been stayed," Tariq Mehmud, a lawyer
for Chaudhry, told AFP after the hearing.


Mehmud said the Supreme Court had demanded that Chaudhry's case
should be heard by a full body comprising all of its judges.


"The court's order shows that the proceedings so far of the
Supreme Judicial Council were unconstitutional," Chaudhry's main
lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan said.


There was no immediate comment from the government.
