Al-Faycali of Jordan scored a late goal to hold Entente Setif of
Algeria 1-1 in the first leg of the Arab Champions League final
at the weekend.


Ivorian Remy Adico gave the 'Black Eagles' of Setif a 31st-minute
lead and Jordanian defender Hatem Aqel levelled five minutes
before full-time at the May 8 Stadium in the north-east Algerian
city.


Amman hosts the return match on May 17 with Faycali favoured to
become the first Jordanian winners of the four-year-old
competition with a first prize of two million dollars.


Club Sportif Sfaxien of Tunisia won the first edition in 2004 and
were succeeded as champions by Al-Ittihad Jeddah of Saudi Arabia
and Raja  Casablanca of Morocco.
