Malaysia's information ministry will create a unit to monitor and
counter what it says are lies being spread on the Internet about
government policies, reports said Wednesday.


Deputy Information Minister Chia Kwang Chye said it will issue
written explanations to tackle what he said was abuse of the
Internet and online technology.


"This special unit will be purely working to disseminate
information, explain correct information and counter the
misinformation on government policies," Chia was quoted as saying
by the Bernama news agency.


"We are in the midst of finalising the administrative part and it
will come into effect very soon," he said.


The move comes amid attacks on Malaysian bloggers and Internet
users by ministers, including Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi, who accuse them of spreading slander and gossip.


The government has threatened punishment and tighter controls on
Internet use in response.


Two prominent bloggers are also being sued for defamation by the
government- linked New Straits Times Press group in an action
criticised as an unprecedented attack on freedom of expression.


Chia said that while the unit will tackle misinformation about
what he said were issues of "national interest", it will not have
the power to act against bloggers, reports said.


"Our role is not to take action against them but rather to give
the public the correct and better information through the
Internet," Chia was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times.
