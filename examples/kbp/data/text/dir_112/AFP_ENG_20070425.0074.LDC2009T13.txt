Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed Israel's condolences over
the death of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who was to
be buried later Wednesday following a lavish state funeral.


"Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, on behalf of the Israeli government,
expresses his sorrow and the condolences of the Israeli people
over the death of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin,"
Olmert's office said.


"Under his leadership, the gates of the immigration of the Soviet
Union to Israel were opened and his ties with the Jewish
community allowed it to lead a flourishing Jewish life in
Russia," a statement added.


The premier extended his condolences to President Vladimir Putin
and the Russian people.


Russia was on Wednesday marking a day of mourning for the funeral
of Yeltsin, who brought down the Soviet Union and forced Russia
through painful democratic reform.


Israel was to be represented at his funeral by its ambassador to
Moscow, Anna Azari, a foreign ministry spokesman said.


Yeltsin, who died on Monday of a heart attack, aged 76, is to be
buried later at the 16th century Novodevichy convent.
