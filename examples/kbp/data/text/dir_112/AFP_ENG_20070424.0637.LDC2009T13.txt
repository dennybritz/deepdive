A journalist was found dead in northern Mexico Tuesday, one week
after he was seized by an armed gang.


He is the 12th Mexican journalist killed since the beginning of
2006 as violent gangs target journalists reporting in illegal
drug trafficking.


Saul Martinez Ortega, 36, who was the chief editor of the
Interdiario de Agua Prieta daily, was seized on April 16 outside
the police headquarters of Agua Prieta, a small Mexican city on
the border with the United States.


His body was found in a ditch, police said.


Earlier this month, a journalist with the Televisa TV network was
killed by gunmen in the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.
