Japan's trade surplus jumped 73.9 percent from a year earlier to
1.63 trillion yen (13.8 billion dollars) in March on strong
exports of cars and electronics parts, the government said
Wednesday.


The surplus exceeded the average market expectation of 1.36
trillion yen determined by the Nikkei business daily.


Exports rose 10.2 percent to 7.51 trillion yen while imports were
flat at 5.88 trillion yen, the government said.


Exports of cars rose 15.1 percent to 1.23 trillion yen while
exports of electronics parts increased 16.9 percent to 475.8
billion yen, it said.


Meanwhile a rise in imports of communications equipment was
offset by a fall in imports of crude oil by value, reflecting
declining oil prices.


For the fiscal year ended March 31, trade surplus rose 16.4
percent from the previous year to 9.05 trillion yen, marking the
first annual rise in two years.


Exports were up 13.4 percent at 77.46 trillion yen for the fiscal
year, while imports rose 13.0 percent to 68.41 trillion yen.
