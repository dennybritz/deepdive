Three workers were injured in a grenade attack on the office of a
US-funded project in the troubled southern Philippine island of
Mindanao, police said Wednesday.


Three men were seen throwing at least two grenades at the office
of the Growth with Equity in Mindanao (GEM) late Tuesday, said
regional police chief Superintendent Frederico Dulay. Three
people were injured.


GEM is a project funded by US assistance to boost the economy of
the southern island of Mindanao, which is plagued by both Muslim
and communist insurgencies.


Regional governor Emmanuel Pinol said the attack was triggered by
GEM's refusal to pay "protection money" to suspects who have been
demanding such payments through cellphone text messages.


He did not say which group was behind the attack but in the past,
former Muslim rebels have resorted to extortion of road projects
to get money.
