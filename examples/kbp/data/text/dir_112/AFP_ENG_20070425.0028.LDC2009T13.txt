Hong Kong share prices finished the morning 0.65 percent lower
after a see-saw session as investors turned cautious ahead of the
expiry of April futures and key US economic data later in the
week, dealers said.


China-related stocks were hit due to weak A-share markets on the
mainland and worries that the Chinese government will soon
announce further measures to rein in its economy, they said.


The benchmark Hang Seng index ended the morning down 134.46
points at 20,438.34.
