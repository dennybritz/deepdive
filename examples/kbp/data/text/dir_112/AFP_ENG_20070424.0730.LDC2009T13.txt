Eleven Ecuadoran opposition legislators arrived in Bogota late
Tuesday and asked for political asylum after a state prosecutor
ordered their arrest for sedition, an Ecuadoran congresswoman
said.


Opposition congresswoman Gloria Gallardo said four more
legislators were expected to follow them into Bogota, out of a
group of 24 that prosecutor Elsa Moreno accused of sedition for
"rising against the government, refusing to recognize the
constitution, and impeding a meeting of the Congress."
