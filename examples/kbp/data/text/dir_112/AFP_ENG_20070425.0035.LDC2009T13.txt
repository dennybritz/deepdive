Greek police on Wednesday sealed off the area around the US
embassy in Athens and detained six people following a tipoff on a
possible attack on the building, the public order ministry said.


A ministry source said all six were Iraqis.


Police said they had acted on information from an Iraqi national
on an imminent attack but now believed that warning was
groundless.


An investigation continues.


A Greek far-left group fired an anti-tank rocket against the
embassy in January in a pre-dawn attack, but nobody was injured.


Greece and the United States have offered a combined two-million
dollar reward for information on the group, Revolutionary
Struggle, which is the country's most dangerous extremist outfit
in operation.
