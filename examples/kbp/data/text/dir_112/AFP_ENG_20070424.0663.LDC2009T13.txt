The opinion poll lead held by Britain's main opposition party the
Conservatives over the governing Labour Party has narrowed,
though a third of voters have rejected both main parties, a poll
published on Wednesday showed.


Support for the Conservatives fell four percentage points to 37
percent, while Labour dropped one point to 30 percent, according
to an ICM poll published in The Guardian daily.


The Liberal Democrats, Britain's third-biggest political party,
rose three points to 21 percent, and smaller parties had a
combined 12 percent backing.


That means that 33 percent of voters do not favour the two main
political parties.


The seven-point Conservative lead is also the narrowest in an ICM
poll since January, indicating that the Conservatives have not
yet been able to capitalise on public disaffection with the
government.


It has been more than a year since Labour led in an ICM poll, The
Guardian said.


The survey comes about 10 days before voters go to the polls to
elect some local councils across Britain, as well as regional
assemblies in Scotland and Wales, in elections that observers
expect Labour will fare poorly in.


ICM Research questioned 1,005 adults by telephone between April
20-22 for the survey.
