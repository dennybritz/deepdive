Charles Darwin's publisher was urged by an adviser not to publish
the scientist's historic work "On the Origin of Species," The
Times reported on Wednesday.


Citing correspondence between Darwin's publisher John Murray and
one of his special advisers Reverend Whitwell Elwin that is on
display at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh, the
paper said that Elwin suggested instead that Darwin write about
pigeons.


Murray asked Elwin for his opinion on Darwin's work on evolution,
and unsurprisingly for a reverend, Elwin gave the evolutionary
thesis, which challenged Church teaching of creationism, a
thumbs-down.


"At every page I was tantalised by the absence of the proofs,"
Elwin wrote to Murray in a letter dated May 3, 1859, lamenting
the "harder and drier" writing style.


Elwin instead suggested an earlier work by Darwin on pigeons
should be made into a book because "everybody is interested in
pigeons."


"The book would be received in every journal in the kingdom and
would soon be on every table."


As history has shown, however, Murray ignored Elwin's advice and
went on to publish Darwin's work.
