Atlanta Thrashers captain Scott Mellanby announced his retirement
on Tuesday, bringing an end to a 21-season National Hockey League
career.


"It's a sad day but a good day," the veteran right wing said.
"It's been a great ride. It's time to go on to do something
else."


Mellanby, 40, helped the Thrashers reach the playoffs for the
first time in franchise history this season, but they were swept
in the Eastern Conference first round by the New York Rangers.


Mellanby played in 1,430 games over 21 seasons with five teams
and reached the Stanley Cup Finals twice - the first with the
Philadelphia Flyers in 1987 and most recently with the Florida
Panthers in 1996.


However, he never got a chance to hoist the Cup over his head.


"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a void in my career, it is,"
Mellanby said. "But I know I gave everything I had on the ice. It
just wasn't in the cards for me."


A second-round pick of Philadelphia in 1984, Mellanby recorded
364 goals and 840 points with the Flyers, Edmonton Oilers,
Panthers, St. Louis Blues and Thrashers.


This past season, Mellanby collected 12 goals and 24 assists in
68 games.  He spent time on injured reserve with a bruised
shoulder.


Mellanby was also nominated for the Bill Masterton Memorial
Trophy, which best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance,
sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.


Mellanby and his wife, Susan, created the Mellanby Autism
Foundation in honor of their son Carter, who was diagnosed with
autism in 1998.
