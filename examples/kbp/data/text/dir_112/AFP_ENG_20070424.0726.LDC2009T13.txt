Rescue workers have found the bodies of 11 miners killed in a gas
blast in a northern Chinese coal district, state media reported
Wednesday.


That find, along with a body pulled out of a separate mine in the
same area after an unrelated accident, brings the overall death
toll from the incidents to 22, although more are still missing.


The Hebei Daily reported on its website that the 11 miners were
initially listed as trapped after Friday's gas blast at the
Tao'er coal mine near Handan city in Hebei province.


Meanwhile at the Dashucun coal mine, also near Handan, rescuers
pulled yet another dead body out, pushing the toll from a gas
blast there one day earlier to 11, according to the Xinhua news
agency.


A total of 17 workers had been working underground at Dashucun at
the time of the explosion, but there was little hope for the
remaining six, the agency said in a report issued late Tuesday.


The two accidents capped a horrific week for China's mining
industry which saw more than 80 workers dead or trapped,
according to state-run media.


This week has also begun badly, with eight miners missing in
north China's Shanxi province after the shaft they were working
in flooded Monday, Xinhua reported earlier.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world. More than 4,700 workers were killed last year, according
to official figures, but independent labour groups put the death
toll at up to 20,000 annually.
