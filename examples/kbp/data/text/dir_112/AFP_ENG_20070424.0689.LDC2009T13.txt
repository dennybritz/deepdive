Foreign investment into Russia will improve because of better
business conditions, the country's finance minister said in an
interview published Wednesday.


Speaking to the Financial Times, Alexei Kudrin also said that
Russia was developing systems to improve stability in its
exchange rate and bring down inflation by strengthening its
reserve fund.


"We see such conditions for business and indicators improving in
such a way that we believe investment will significantly grow,"
Kudrin told the business daily.


"If in Russia five years ago, a project of one billion dollars
(734 million euros) was difficult to realise, today any private
company can put 350 million dollars, or 450 million dollars, or
one billion dollars into a project."


He also said that Russia's plans to employ strict financial
controls in terms of its reserves, due to come into effect next
February, will have the dual effects of stabilising the ruble and
bringing down inflation.


"We're developing a system of security in the reserve fund and
stricter use of oil and gas revenues for spending," Kudrin said.


"And that will contribute to reducing inflation and stabilising
the exchange rate."
