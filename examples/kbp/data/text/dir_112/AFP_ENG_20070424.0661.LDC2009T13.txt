South Korea's economy grew four percent year-on-year in the first
quarter as strong exports and corporate spending offset a
manufacturing slowdown, the central bank said Wednesday.


Gross domestic product expanded 0.9 percent from the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Bank of Korea said in an advance estimate.


The quarterly annualised growth rate was the same as for the
previous quarter.


"Amid a continued expansion in consumer spending, corporate
capital expenditure and exports of goods remained strong," the
central bank said. "Despite a lacklustre manufacturing sector,
gains in the construction industry accelerated, while service
businesses maintained resilient growth."


The central bank predicts growth of four percent in the first
half and 4.7 percent in the second half, or 4.4 percent over the
whole year.


This compares with an increase of five percent last year.
