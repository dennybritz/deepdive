Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani on Wednesday left
Tehran for Ankara to hold talks on the Iranian nuclear programme
with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, IRNA news agency
said.


The state-run agency said that Larijani was accompanied by his
deputy Javad Vaidi, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and
the deputy head of Iran's nuclear organisation Mohammad Saeedi
for the crunch talks.


Larijani and Solana will examine if there is any scope for
reopening negotiations to find an end to a five-year standoff
that has raised tensions between the Islamic republic and the
West and seen Tehran slapped with two sets of UN sanctions.


The pair held several rounds of discussions last year which
failed to find a solution to the crisis. They last met face-to-
face for informal talks on the sidelines of a Munich security
conference on February 11.


IRNA said that Larijani would also be holding talks with Turkish
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Abdullah
Gul and President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.


Iran has dampened hopes of a breakthrough ahead of the talks by
insisting it has no intention of yielding to the West's key
demand to quit uranium enrichment.
