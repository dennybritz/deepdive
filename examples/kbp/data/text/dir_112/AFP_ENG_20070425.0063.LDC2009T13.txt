A consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland said Wednesday it had
proposed a 75.7 -billion-euro counter-bid for Dutch group ABN
Amro, topping an offer from Barclays by 13 percent in the biggest
banking deal ever.


The proposal by RBS, Belgian bank Fortis and Banco Santander of
Spain, would be worth 103 billion dollars in cash and shares and
would substantially exceed a 67 -billion-euro offer from Barclay
accepted by ABN Amro management on Monday.
