The Tampa Bay Devil Rays placed Japanese third baseman Akinori
Iwamura on the 15-day disabled list with a right oblique strain
on Tuesday.


Iwamura, in his first season with the Devil Rays after signing a
three-year contract, is batting .339 with one homer, five RBI and
three stolen bases in 18 games. He also leads the team with a
.470 on-base percentage.


To replace Iwamura on the roster, the Devil Rays recalled
infielder Jorge Cantu from Class AAA Durham of the International
League. He was batting .267 with eight RBI in 19 games in the
minors.
