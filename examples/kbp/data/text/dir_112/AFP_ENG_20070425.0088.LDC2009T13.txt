The huge, gold-domed cathedral where Boris Yeltsin's body lay in
state on Wednesday is a painstaking replica of a landmark blown
up by Stalin and rebuilt under Yeltsin as a symbol of post-Soviet
rebirth.


With its white walls and vast gold cupola, Christ the Saviour is
one of the most recognisable sights of central Moscow.


Tsar Alexander I ordered construction of Christ the Saviour
immediately after Napoleon's invading army retreated from Moscow
in 1812, but it took until 1839 under Tsar Nicholas before work
got underway.


The huge cathedral was consecrated on May 26, 1883, the day Tsar
Alexander III was crowned.


To emphasise Soviet atheist rule, Stalin ordered the dynamiting
of the church and stripping of its many art works and treasures
in 1931.


The plan was to build a vast monument to Lenin, but construction
problems, war and flooding meant that the Soviet authorities
eventually gave up and instead built what was then the world's
biggest swimming pool.


With the end of the Soviet Union and religious resurgence in
Russia, Yeltsin oversaw a dramatic reconstruction programme.
Foundations were poured in 1994 and the gleaming new church was
consecrated in August, 2000.
