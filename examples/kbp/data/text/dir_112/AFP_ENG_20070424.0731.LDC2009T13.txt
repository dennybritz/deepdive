Eleven Ecuadoran opposition legislators arrived in Bogota late
Tuesday and asked for political asylum after a state prosecutor
ordered their arrest for sedition, an Ecuadoran congresswoman
said.


Opposition congresswoman Gloria Gallardo said four more
legislators were expected to follow them into Bogota.


"We have come to Colombia, which is a sister-country, to ask for
protection and political asylum," said Gallardo, who arrived on a
flight from Quito together with 10 other deputies from the right-
wing PRIAN party.


The 15 were part of a group of 24 deputies that prosecutor Elsa
Moreno accused Tuesday of sedition for "rising against the
government, refusing to recognize the constitution, and impeding
a meeting of the Congress."


They and 26 others were sacked from the Ecuadoran legislature in
March over their refusal to go along with far-reaching
constitutional reforms promoted by President Rafael Correa.


However, Correa, who is battling with the legislature and the
judiciary over his sweeping leftist reform program, said Tuesday
he opposed the order for their arrest, even as he refused to
honor a court order that they be reinstated to the Congress.
