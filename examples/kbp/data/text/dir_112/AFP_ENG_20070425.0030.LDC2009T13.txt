Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter's generous impulse
has him in trouble with Major League Baseball officials.


Hunter sent the Kansas City Royals four bottles of champagne at
the weekend, making good on a promise he made after the Royals
swept Detroit last September, which helped the Twins capture
their division.


But baseball bans such gifts, lest they lead to or give the
appearance of tampering among teams.


"Any player or person connected with a Club who shall offer or
give any gift or reward to a player or person connected with
another Club for services rendered ... in defeating or attempting
to defeat a competing Club ... shall be declared ineligible for
not less than three years," according to MLB rule 21-b.


Hunter's misstep was first reported on The Cheater's Guild to
Baseball Blog.


On Monday, the Twins were contacted by the office of MLB
commissioner Bud Selig. The Twins then contacted the Royals, who
agreed to send the still unopened bubbly back.


"I'm to blame as much as anybody because I didn't know the rule,"
Twins general manager Terry Ryan told the Star Tribune in
Minneapolis. "We'll end up righting the wrong."


While Ryan thought Hunter made "an honest mistake," he
acknowledged that baseball couldn't just let the matter go.


"Integrity of the game, it's as simple as that," Ryan said. "This
is an honest, trivial exchange, but it could grow into something
different if you let it get away."
