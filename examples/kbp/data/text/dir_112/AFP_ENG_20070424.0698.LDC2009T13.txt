Japanese share prices fell 0.96 percent in morning trade on
Wednesday as investors fretted over the health of the US economy
and upcoming domestic corporate results, dealers said.


They said that investors were unnerved by a weaker dollar
following a sharp plunge in existing US home sales.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
fell 167.18 points to 17,284.59 by the lunch break.


The broader Topix index of all first-section shares dropped 17.54
points or 1.03 percent to 1,688.62.
