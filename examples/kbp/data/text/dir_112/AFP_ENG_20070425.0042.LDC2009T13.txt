Sri Lanka's left-handed batsman Russel Arnold will retire from
international cricket after the World Cup final, Sri Lanka
Cricket (SLC) said on Wednesday.


"Russel has informed his decision to team manager Michael Tissera
in Jamaica and it has now been officially conveyed to the cricket
board," SLC spokesman Samantha Algama told AFP.


Arnold will, however, continue to play domestic cricket, Algama
added.


Sri Lanka, who defeated New Zealand in Tuesday's semi-final, will
meet the winner between Australia and South Africa in Saturday's
final in Barbados.


Arnold, 33, made his Test debut in Colombo against Pakistan in
1997 and enjoyed a permanent position in the Sri Lankan side
between 1999 and 2003.


Temporary loss of form forced him on the sidelines over the past
two years before the selectors brought him back for the World
Cup.


Arnold played 44 Tests, scoring 1,821 runs with three centuries.


The World Cup final will be his 180th one-dayer. He has made
3,949 one-day runs with one hundred.
