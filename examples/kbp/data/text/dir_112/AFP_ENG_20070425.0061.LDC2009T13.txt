England's 1966 World Cup winner Alan Ball died from a heart
attack overnight, his family said Wednesday. He was 61.


At 21, Ball was the youngest member of England's World Cup
winning team. He played 72 times for his country, scoring eight
goals.


The former Arsenal and Everton midfielder also forged a career in
management, taking charge at Southampton, Manchester City and
Portsmouth.


Ball's son Jimmy told Britain's domestic Press Association news
agency that his father had watched on television as Manchester
United beat visitors AC Milan 3-2 in Tuesday's Champions League
semi-final first leg.


"I was talking to him last night just after the football and he
was in great form. We were talking about (Paul) Scholes's pass,"
he said from his father's home in Southampton on the southern
English coast,


"And then I got a phone call in the middle of the night. It's
unbelievable and very, very sad."


Ball cut a distinctive with his diminutive stature, high-pitched
voice and flame-red hair.


He began his career with Blackpool, turning professional in May
1962 and making his league debut in a 2-1 win at Liverpool on
August 18 that year.
