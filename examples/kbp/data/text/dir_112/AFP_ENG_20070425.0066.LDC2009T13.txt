Economy Minister Ali Babacan is likely to replace Abdullah Gul,
named the ruling party's candidate for president, as Turkey's new
foreign minister, press reports said Wednesday.


If appointed, Babacan will remain Turkey's chief negotiator with
the European Union and the job will be merged with the foreign
affairs portfolio, the mass- circulation dailies Hurriyet and
Sabah reported.


State Ministers Besir Atalay and Mehmet Aydin are other possible
candidates for the foreign ministry, according to the press.


At 40, Babacan is the youngest member of the government, which he
joined as minister of the economy at the age of 35 after the
governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the 2002
general elections.


He has been heading accession talks with the EU since they began
in October 2005.


Following harsh secularist objections to his purported
presidential ambitions, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on
Tuesday named Gul as the AKP's candidate for the post.


Gul, 56, is virtually certain to become president thanks to the
comfortable, 353-seat majority the AKP holds in the 550-member
parliament, which will elect the president for a single seven-
year term.


The vote, which can go up to four rounds, begins Friday.
