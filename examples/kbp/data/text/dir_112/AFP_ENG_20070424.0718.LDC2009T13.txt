Up to 30 large Chinese firms are expected to buy foreign products
worth as much as 10 billion dollars at a sourcing fair as the
nation seeks to curb its yawning trade surplus, state press said
Wednesday.


The International Sourcing Fair, slated for September 25 to 27 in
Shanghai, is another step taken by China to secure a more
balanced trade environment, the China Daily reported, citing Vice
Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng.


China's trade surplus roughly doubled in the first three months
of the year to 46.4 billion dollars, despite successive moves to
reduce export tax incentives while making imports easier and more
attractive.


"Our efforts to facilitate imports will work and China will make
substantial progress in achieving more balanced trade," Gao said.


China has been keen to prove its commitment to ease trade
tensions with its major trading partners like the United States
but officials stressed it takes time for government measures to
have an effect.


"The surplus, which resulted from the global industrial
structure, is likely to remain for some time," Gao said.


State media reported earlier that China is likely to ink import
deals valued at up to 12 billion dollars with the US companies
during a high-profile bilateral strategic economic dialogue in
the United States in May.
