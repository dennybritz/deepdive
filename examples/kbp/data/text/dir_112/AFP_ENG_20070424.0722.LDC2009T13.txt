Taiwan's Acer Inc, the world's third largest personal computer
vendor, said Wednesday its net profit in 2006 rose 20 percent to
10.22 billion Taiwan dollars (303 million US) due to strong
demand.


Sales were also up 16 percent to 238.20 billion dollars from the
previous year, it said.


Acer announced last week it replaced China's Lenovo Group as the
world's third largest personal computer vendor in the quarter to
March, citing a report released by IT research organisation
Gartner Datarequest.


During the three months period, Acer said it sold 4.28 million
PCs, or 6.8 percent of the global PC market, compared with
Lenovo's 3.97 million, or 6.3 percent, according to Gartner
Datarequest.
