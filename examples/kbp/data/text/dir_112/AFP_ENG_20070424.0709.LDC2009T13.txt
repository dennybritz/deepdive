Hong Kong share prices opened 0.43 percent lower Wednesday as
investors waited for the expiry of the April stock futures
contracts and key US economic data, dealers said.


They said select blue chips found support following Wall Street's
recovery overnight from early losses after disappointing housing
and consumer confidence data.


The Hang Seng Index opened down 88.62 points at 20,484.18.
