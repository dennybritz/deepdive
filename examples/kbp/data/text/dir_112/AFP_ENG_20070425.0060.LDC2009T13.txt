Japan's Sharp Corp. on Wednesday reported a fourth consecutive
year of record profits thanks to fast-growing sales of flat-
screen televisions.


Sharp, Japan's largest liquid crystal display (LCD) panel maker,
said its net profit rose 14.7 percent to 101.72 billion yen (859
million dollars) in the year to March on revenue of 3.13 trillion
yen, up 11.8 percent.


Operating profit jumped 13.9 percent to 186.53 billion yen, the
Osaka-based firm said in a statement.


Sharp is riding high on a boom in demand for flat televisions as
consumers ditch their bulky old tube sets for ultra thin new
ones.


Sales of audio-visual and communication equipment jumped 26.6
percent in value in the year and are expected to rise a further
16.6 percent this year.


The company forecast a fifth record annual performance,
projecting a 3.2 percent rise in net profit for the year to March
2008 to 105 billion yen.


It expects operating profit to grow 1.9 percent to 190 billion
yen, with revenue up 8.7 percent to 3.4 trillion yen.
