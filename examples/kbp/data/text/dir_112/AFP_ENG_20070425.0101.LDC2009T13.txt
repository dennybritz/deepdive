Six major US movie studios have won a lawsuit against a Beijing
company for selling counterfeit DVDs of their films, state media
reported on Wednesday.


A Beijing court ordered Beijing Cherry Blossom Star Culture Co.
and an affiliated DVD shop to stop the sales and pay 195,000 yuan
(25,000 dollars) to the studios, the official Xinhua news agency
said.


The US move houses -- Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, Universal
Studios, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Walt Disney --
had asked for 2.46 million yuan (318,000 dollars) in damages.


The case comes as China-US tensions over the issue have spiked
with Washington's decision earlier this month to take China
before the World Trade Organisation for "rampant" pirating of
American movies, books and other products.


The studios sent personnel to buy movies in the Lihua Zhisheng
DVD shop in 2005, coming away with 13 counterfeit versions of
their films, Xinhua said.


The shop was affiliated with Cherry Blossom Star Culture Co., it
said.


The company admitted its connection to the shop but said it could
not pay the requested damages. The court ordered the sales to
stop and for the company to pay 15,000 yuan in compensation for
each of the 13 films.
