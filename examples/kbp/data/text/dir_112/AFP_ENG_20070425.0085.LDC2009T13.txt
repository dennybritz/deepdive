Sunni Muslim militants shot dead three people Wednesday in a
targeted sectarian shooting in northwest Pakistan, police and
officials said.


The assailants sprayed bullets from a Kalashnikov rifle on a
vehicle in which two brothers from a prominent Shiite Muslim
family and their Sunni employee were traveling in Dera Ismail
Khan district.


All three died instantly and the attackers fled, police said.


"The victims were returning after spraying their crops with
insecticide," district police chief Zulfiqar Cheema told AFP. "It
was a targeted killing" by Sunni militants, Cheema said.


An official of the provincial government, Allama Ramzan Tauqeer,
blamed the attack on banned Sunni extremist outfit Sipah-e-Sahaba
and urged Shiite community members to remain peaceful.


Eight people were killed in sporadic sectarian attacks in the
volatile district which borders Pakistan's restive tribal areas
last month.


Sectarian violence between Pakistan's Sunni and Shiite
communities has claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late
1980s. Shiites account for about 20 percent of Pakistan's 160
million Sunni-dominated population.
