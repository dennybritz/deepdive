Poland's former construction minister Barbara Blida committed
suicide Wednesday as police searched her home as part of a
corruption probe, security officials said.


Blida, 57, went into the bathroom and shot herself in the chest
as police conducted an early-morning search of her home in
Siemianowice Slaskie, in the southern province of Silesia,
Magdalena Stanczyk, a spokeswoman for the counter- espionnage
Interior Security Bureau (ABW), said.


"Barbara Blida was among people who were being investigated in
relation to illicit payments made to public sector workers. She
was suspected of having paid bribes but no formal charges had
been brought against her," Stanczyk said.


A former member of Poland's communist party who joined the Social
Democratic party after Poland restored democracy, Blida was
construction minister from 1993 to 1996 in the left-wing
governments of Waldemar Pawlak, Jozef Oleksy and Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz.


After she left government, she became president of a leading
development company.


The Polish government has announced a probe into the exact
circumstances surrounding Blida's death.
