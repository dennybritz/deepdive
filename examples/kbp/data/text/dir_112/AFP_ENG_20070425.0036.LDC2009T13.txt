Japan's Honda Motor reported Wednesday a small drop in annual
profits, snapping a five-year record-breaking streak as it
battles tough competition in its home market and in China.


Honda posted net earnings of 592.3 billion yen (5.0 billion
dollars) for the fiscal year to March, better than its own
forecast for a 555 billion yen profit but about 0.8 percent less
than the previous year's 597.0 billion.


Operating profit dropped by about two percent to 851.9 billion
yen while revenue grew by roughly 12 percent to 11.09 trillion
yen.


Honda forecast a further decline in earnings in the current
fiscal year to March 2008, when it expects net profit of 575
billion yen and operating profit of 770 billion yen.


The downturn follows five consecutive years of record profits at
Honda, which like other Japanese automakers has enjoyed brisk
sales in the US market even as local automakers General Motors
and Ford struggle.
