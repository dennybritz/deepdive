Militants ambushed a police vehicle in western Afghanistan
overnight and killed three policemen, an official said Wednesday,
in the latest in an upsurge of unrest in the region.


The police came under small arms fire south of Herat city late
Tuesday. "Three police were martyred in the attack and another
four were wounded," Herat province criminal investigation
director Ali Khan told AFP.


The police had been guarding a hydro-power dam that is being
built with Indian funding.


Khan did not blame anyone for the attack but similar ones have
been carried out by Taliban militants increasingly active in
western Afghanistan, which has been relatively peaceful compared
to insurgency-hit south.


The extremist Taliban, forced from power in late 2001, are waging
a bloody insurgency that claimed more than 4,000 lives in 2006.


The ultra-Islamic fighters rely on attack-and-run tactics as well
as suicide and roadside bombings.


There are more than 50,000 foreign troops helping the fledgling
Afghan army and police fight the militants and their Islamist
allies.
