Golf legend Jack Nicklaus said Wednesday China will eventually
produce some of the world's top players as the sport continues to
build in popularity.


"There's no question. There are a great number of people (in
China) who will play golf, and there will be many golfers from
China that will be very successful on the world tour," Nicklaus
said.


Nicklaus formally opened the second of two golf courses he
designed at Pine Valley golf club outside Beijing and later told
a news conference that the sport's physical requirements play to
Chinese strengths.


"There have been many good Chinese athletes in every sport and
golf is probably a very, very good sport for the Chinese in terms
of stature and size. Golf depends more on quickness than on
size," said the 18-time Major winner.


"There's no real reason why (Chinese athletes) won't do well on
the golf course. It will just take time for the game to develop
in this country and bring along the young people."


Like many other sports, golf has expanded rapidly in China in
recent years as the country's dramatic economic growth has
allowed more time for leisure pursuits.


Last month, Chinese golfer Liang Wenchong won the Singapore
Masters, an event co-sanctioned on the Asian and European tours.


Golf's growth has not come without controversy, however.


Previous moves to introduce golf curriculum in government-funded
universities have drawn harsh criticism as the sport was seen as
an expensive pursuit still well out of the range of the vast
majority of the country's people.
