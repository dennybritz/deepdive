US forces have killed an Al-Qaeda kingpin they allege sent 12
-year-old Iraqi boys to their deaths as suicide car bombers, a
military statement said Tuesday.


US command said they had identified a suspect killed northwest of
Baghdad on April 20 as Muhammad Abdullah Abbas al-Issawi, also
known as Abu Akram and Abu Abd al-Sattar, the Al-Qaeda "security
emir" in eastern Anbar province.


"Coalition forces were conducting operations targeting associates
of a known senior leader within Al-Qaeda in Iraq," the statement
said.


"During the operation the terrorists engaged ground forces with
small arms fire. Coalition forces used appropriate self-defence
measures and engaged the armed men, killing two and detaining
one," it said.


According to the statement, suicide bomb vests were found at the
scene, and "intelligence reports also indicate that his VBIED
(car bomb) cell used 12- to 13-year-old children as VBIED
drivers."


The statement also alleged that the dead suspect was an associate
of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq
who was killed last June in a US air strike.
