EU regulators on Wednesday approved US conglomerate General
Electric's purchase of US pharmaceutical group Abbott
Laboratories' diagnostics business.


"After careful examination, the (European) Commission concluded
that the transaction would not significantly impede effective
competition," the EU antitrust watchdog said in a statement.


The two companies agreed in January that General Electric would
buy the business for 8.13 billion dollars (5.96 billion euros) in
cash.
