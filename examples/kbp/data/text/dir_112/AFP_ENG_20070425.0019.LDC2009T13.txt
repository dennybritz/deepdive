About 300 people queued Wednesday outside Moscow's Christ the
Saviour cathedral to pay last respects to Boris Yeltsin ahead of
his funeral.


Mourners waited under grey skies to enter the golden-domed
cathedral, where Russia's first post-Communist leader lay in an
open coffin draped in the Russian tricolor flag.


Several thousand people attended the lying-in-state late Tuesday,
along with Yeltsin's immediate family. Yeltsin was to be buried
after approximately 3:00 pm (1100 GMT) in the Novodevichy
cemetery, according to the Kremlin.


However, huge crowds were not expected, reflecting widespread
dislike for the leader who brought down the Soviet Union and
forced Russia through painful, often chaotic economic and
political reforms.


"Yeltsin freed me from the Communist disease. He gave me back my
property. Everything's become more grey now," said doctor Nikolai
Churyumo, 57, clutching a bunch of red carnations outside Christ
the Saviour. "Now there's a drift from Yeltsin's policies. People
have forgotten what he achieved."


At 1:30 pm (0930 GMT) an hour-long religious service will be
attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and foreign
dignitaries. Yeltsin's body will then be taken in a cortege to
Novodevichy.
