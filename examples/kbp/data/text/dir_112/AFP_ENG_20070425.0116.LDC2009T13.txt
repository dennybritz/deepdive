China's aviation industry continued to grow in the first quarter,
with passenger transport up 15.9 percent year on year as
international travelling surged, state media said Wednesday.


From January to March, passenger transport volume reached 40.9
million people, up 15.9 percent from a year earlier, the Xinhua
news agency reported, citing sources with the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China.


Passengers travelling on international routes jumped by 23.9
percent to 3.8 million while those travelling on domestic routes
amounted to 37.1 million, up 15.1 percent, the report said.


International cargo transport rose 25.1 percent to 238,000
tonnes, with total cargo transport volume up 13.3 percent at
858,000 tonnes, it added.


Industry observers attributed the rapid growth in international
transport to growing external trade and the extension of
services, Xinhua said.
