A consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland proposed a counter bid
on Wednesday for Dutch group ABN Amro, topping an offer of 67
billion euros by Barclays in the biggest banking deal ever.


The consortium, which pulled out of takeover talks with ABN
earlier this week, said its proposal was pitched at 39 euros per
share, compared with Barclays' offer of 36.25 euros per share.


The proposal was at "a price indication of 39 euros per share,
subject to due diligence," said a statement from the consortium
which also comprises Dutch- Belgian group Fortis and SCH of
Spain.


"This would be 13 percent higher than the value of the Barclays
offer as of the market close (on Tuesday)."


The consortium added: "The banks are of the clear view that their
proposals are superior for ABN Amro's shareholders."
