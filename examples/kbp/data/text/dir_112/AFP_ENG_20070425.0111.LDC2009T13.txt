A pregnant cow has died two days after causing extensive damage
as she went on the rampage through a German city for more than
three hours, reports said on Wednesday.


The Charolais cow, named Beate, escaped from a farm on Monday and
charged through the northern city of Hanover, resisting the
increasingly desperate efforts of police and local residents to
capture her.


Television crews and police cars joined the pursuit as Beate
trampled on gardens and charged at cars, causing an estimated
25,000 euros (34,100 dollars) of damage.


She was only brought under control when tranquilizer darts were
fired at her.


The cow had been due to give birth this week, but she died
suddenly on Tuesday. Her unborn calf has also died.
