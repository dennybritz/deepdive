Chinese police detained four Americans at Mount Everest base camp
Wednesday after a protest against China's plan to take the
Olympic torch to the top of the mountain, a rights group said.


Three protesters were held after erecting a banner that read "One
World, One Dream, Free Tibet 2008," the New York-based Students
For A Free Tibet organisation said in a statement.


'One world, One Dream,' is an official Beijing Olympic slogan.


Other similar banners in Chinese and Tibetan were also unfurled,
while one protester wore a shirt that said "No torch through
Tibet."


The protesters included Tenzin Dorjee, the first known exiled
Tibetan to return to the region to protest, the statement said.


The other two activists were identified as Kirsten Westby and Mac
Sutherlin, while a fourth American, videographer Shannon Service,
who was there to document the protest was also detained, the
group said.


The US embassy in Beijing said it was unaware of the incident but
would seek consular access to those Americans detained if the
incident was confirmed.


Authorities in Tibet were not immediately available to comment.


China sent troops in to "liberate" Tibet in 1951. The Dalai Lama
later fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising and
established a government-in-exile in Dharamsala.
