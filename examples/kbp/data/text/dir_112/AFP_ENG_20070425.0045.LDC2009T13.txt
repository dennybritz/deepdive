Pilots from Singapore Airlines (SIA) on Wednesday wrapped up
their submissions to settle a pay dispute in arbitration court,
saying they deserve higher wages when they fly the Airbus A380
later this year.


The Air Line Pilots Association of Singapore (ALPA-S) president,
Captain P. James, said asking for higher salaries to fly the
double-decker A380, the world's biggest passenger plane, fits
long-established practice.


"Different fleets command different pay. This is market practice
and has also been the company's practice," he told the Industrial
Arbitration Court.


The three-day hearing concluded Wednesday.


Both the pilot's union and SIA have until May to submit final
written arguments to the court which will then determine a date
to announce the outcome of the case.


SIA wants to peg the A380 pilots' pay to that of the wage scale
for the Boeing B777, where a captain earns a starting salary of
9,300 Singapore dollars (6,159 US) a month.


The carrier, one of the most profitable in the business, is the
launch customer for the A380 super jumbo jet and is scheduled to
receive the first of its planes in October after a series of
delays that plagued European manufacturer Airbus.


The airline has committed to buy 19 of the A380s.


ALPA-S, with about 1,700 members, has long been regarded as the
only workers' group in Singapore willing to stand up to the
government, which has kept a tight rein on industrial action.
