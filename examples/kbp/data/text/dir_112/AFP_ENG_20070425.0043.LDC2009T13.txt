Thailand's army-backed government said Wednesday it will
reinforce troops in the country's Muslim-majority south in a bid
to rein in a long-running insurgency.


"The army commander (General Sonthi Boonyaratglin) told me we
need to reinforce the military in order to better protect
innocent lives and property," Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont
told reporters.


Some 30,000 troops are stationed in three restive provinces along
the southern border with Malaysia, but Surayud, a former general,
declined to say how many more will be deployed.


The English-daily Bangkok Post said Wednesday the army would send
an extra 15,000 soldiers to the south.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in three years of unrest
in the southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani on the
border with Malaysia.


Surayud's government, which came to power after a Sonthi led coup
in September, launched a series of peace efforts, including an
apology to Muslims over past abuses, in a bid to quell the
insurgency.


But violence has escalated in the past six months with near-daily
bombing and shooting attacks.


In the latest unrest a Buddhist man was shot dead by suspected
rebels in a drive-by shooting Wednesday in Pattani.


The three troubled provinces were once an autonomous sultanate,
until the region was annexed by mainly Buddhist Thailand a
century ago. Separatist unrest has erupted periodically ever
since.
