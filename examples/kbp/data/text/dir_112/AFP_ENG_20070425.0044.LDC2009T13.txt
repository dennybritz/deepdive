A Singapore Air Force refuelling aircraft left Wednesday for the
Gulf where it will support multinational forces in Iraq and
Afghanistan, the defence ministry said.


The KC-135 tanker will conduct air-to-air refuelling missions in
support of multinational forces during its three-month
deployment, a ministry news release said.


Since 2003, Singapore has deployed Landing Ships Tank vessels, a
Hercules C-130 aircraft, as well as refuelling tankers to the
Gulf.


The tiny city-state, which US President George W. Bush visited
last November, has been an unwavering United States ally and its
leaders have urged the US to "stay the course" in Iraq.
