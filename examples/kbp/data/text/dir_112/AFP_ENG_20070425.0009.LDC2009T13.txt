Ken Griffey Jr. belted his 564th home run to surpass Reggie
Jackson for 10th on the all-time list as Cincinnati opened a
nine-game road trip with a victory over St. Louis on Tuesday.


Alex Gonzalez slugged two homers and Aaron Harang pitched into
the eighth inning as the Reds Triumphed 10-3.


Gonzalez, who entered batting .255 with a homer and six RBI this
season, belted a two-run homer in the second against St. Louis
starter Kip Wells and added a three-run blast in the fifth to
complete the fourth two-homer game of his career.


Gonzalez, who also doubled and singled, finished 4-for-5 with
four runs and drove in five runs for the third time in his
career.


He also made the play of the game in the sixth, going deep in the
hole between third and shortstop and making a jump-throw to nip
Albert Pujols.


Harang, who led the National League with six complete games last
season, surrendered two runs and five hits in 7 2/3 innings with
two walks and five strikeouts to improve to 4-6 all-time against
the Cardinals. After allowing a walk and single to lead off the
third, he retired three straight.


Griffey drilled a first-pitch offering from Wells deep over the
right field fence for a two-run homer in the fifth. It was his
first of the season in his 54th at-bat.
