Danish cabin crews at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) held a
second day of strike action Wednesday, forcing the cancellation
of about 100 flights, SAS Denmark said.


Some 101 European flights to and from Copenhagen have been
cancelled, the airline said.


All SAS flights are cancelled until 1200 GMT, except 16 serving
the Swedish capital Stockholm operated by SAS-Sverige, the
airline's Swedish subsidiary, it added.


The cabin staff walked off the job in a wildcat strike Tuesday
when 112 flights were also cancelled leaving thousands of
travellers stranded.


Some 600 people had to spend the night at Kastrup airport due to
a lack of hotel rooms.


SAS was already hit last month by a similar strike after the
airline failed to reach a collective agreement with the
1,600-member Cabin Attendants Union.


Cabin crew spokesman Niels Henrik Madsen said Tuesday that flight
attendants were dissatisfied with their collective agreement
being included in a private sector agreement.
