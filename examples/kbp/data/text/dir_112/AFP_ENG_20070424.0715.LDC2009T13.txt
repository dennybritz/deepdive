China's economic data do not always add up and officials
measuring the world's fourth-largest economy must do a better
job, state media said Wednesday, citing the nation's chief
statistician.


The problem extends to vital statistics such as gross domestic
product (GDP), unemployment and real estate prices, the Shanghai
Securities News reported, quoting Xie Fuzhan, director of the
National Statistics Bureau.


Xie urged his staff to live come up to scratch by making sure
monthly, quarterly and annual figures are consistent, the
newspaper said.


Survey teams and statistics bureaus at all levels must address
the quality of their work and improve the accuracy of primary
data, Xie said.


There has long been doubts about the accuracy of China's
statistics which are suspected of being bloated by local
governments hoping to make themselves look good with Beijing.


In August, a report from the top economic planner showed the
economies in three quarters of China's provinces expanded at 12
percent or more in the first half of 2006, above the official
national figure of less than 11 percent.


Largely to blame for the misreporting is a system that has made
the pursuit of economic expansion and development the top
criteria for provincial cadres' political advancement.


According to the government, the economy grew 10.7 percent in
2006, picking up to an even more blistering pace of 11.1 percent
in the first quarter of this year.
