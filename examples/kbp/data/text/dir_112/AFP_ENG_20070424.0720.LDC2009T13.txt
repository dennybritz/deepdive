China's oil imports in March were up 8.8 percent from a year
earlier to 13.9 million tonnes, state media reported Wednesday.


In contrast to growing imports, the country's crude exports
slumped 83.2 percent on the year to just 218,988 tonnes, the
report said, citing the General Administration of Customs.


The trade pattern is set to continue for the rest of the year
given surging domestic demand and increasing cost of production
in the country, the paper said.


"The ever-soaring local demand for fuel requires less exports
from the country," said Han Xuegong, a senior consultant with
China National Petroleum Company, according to the report.


"Although international crude prices fluctuate at a fairly high
level, the cost of production within China is also increasing
with labour cost and raw material expenses on the rise," he
added.


China cut tariffs on 58 imported goods and imposed temporary
tariffs on 110 export items late last year in a bid to encourage
imports and preserve resources at home.


Crude was on both lists and its exports carry a five percent
tariff, the report said.


The China Daily said that oil imports may rise 10 percent for the
full year, four percentage points lower than in 2006, with
government policies aimed at boosting energy conservation and
bringing down fuel consumption.
