Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani arrived here
Wednesday for two days of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme
with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, the Anatolia news
agency reported.


Larijani is scheduled to meet Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan for lunch before talks with Solana at an Ankara hotel
later Wednesday.


Iranian and EU officials are expected to meet Turkish Foreign
Minister Abdullah Gul -- who has just been named the ruling party
candidate for the Turkish presidency -- at breakfast Thursday,
after which they are expected to make a joint statement.


Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said Larijani was accompanied
by his deputy Javad Vaidi, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi
and the deputy head of Iran's nuclear organisation, Mohammad
Saeedi.


Larijani and Solana will see if it is possible to reopen
negotiations seeking an end to a five-year standoff that has
raised tensions between Iran and the West and seen Tehran slapped
with two sets of UN sanctions.


The pair held several rounds of talks last year that failed to
find a solution to the crisis. They last met face-to-face for
informal talks on the sidelines of a Munich security conference
on February 11.


Iran has dampened hopes of a breakthrough ahead of the talks by
insisting it has no intention of yielding to the West's key
demand to quit uranium enrichment.
