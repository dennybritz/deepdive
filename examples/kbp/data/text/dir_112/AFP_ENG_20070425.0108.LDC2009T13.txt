Hong Kong share prices closed 0.18 percent weaker Wednesday on
worries the mainland could see a significant correction if the
Chinese government announces further macro-economic controls,
possibly during the golden week holidays next week, dealers said.


Any sharp fall on the Shanghai market will have a spillover
effect on Chinese firms listed here, they said.


Investors were also cautious ahead of the expiry of April futures
contracts and the release of key US economic data later in the
week.


The benchmark Hang Seng index closed down 36.02 points at
20,536.78.
