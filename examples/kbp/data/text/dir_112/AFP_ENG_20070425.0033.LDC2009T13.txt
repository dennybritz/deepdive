Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse will fly to Barbados to
cheer the national team in the cricket World Cup final later this
week, a senior aide said on Wednesday.


"It is almost certain that the president will leave on Thursday
at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Barbados," said
Chandrapala Liyanage, a senior presidential aide.


Sri Lanka, World Cup champions in 1996, outclassed New Zealand by
81 runs in Tuesday's semi-final in Jamaica.


Mahela Jayawardene's men now await the winner of the other semi-
final between world champions Australia and South Africa to
determine their opponent in Saturday's final.


"The president's visit is to mark the appreciation of the efforts
of the cricketers in reaching the final," Liyanage said.


Sri Lanka Cricket, the local governing body, said a red carpet
welcome awaited the team on their return, irrespective of the
outcome of the final.


The team will be paraded in an open motorcade from the airport to
downtown Colombo for a congratulation ceremony.
