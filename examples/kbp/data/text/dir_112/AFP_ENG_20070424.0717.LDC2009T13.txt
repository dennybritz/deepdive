Britain's main journalists' union will hold a vigil on Wednesday
for kidnapped BBC journalist Alan Johnston, who has spent more
than six weeks in captivity in Gaza.


The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) vigil will be held
outside the Palestinian General Delegation office in Hammersmith,
west London, at 12:30 pm and will be addressed by the Palestinian
Head of Mission Manuel Hassassian.


"We will not cease until Alan is free to rejoin his friends and
family and resume his life as an internationally respected BBC
journalist," said NUJ General Secretary Jeremy Dear, who will
hand in a letter demanding more resources and effort be devoted
to freeing Johnston.


"All our efforts have been to bring pressure to bear on the
authorities, not only to work hard to secure Alan's safety and
release but to address the threats to all journalists in the
region and to enable them to work free from the threat of kidnap,
intimidation and threats."


Johnston, 44, was snatched at gunpoint as he drove home from work
in Gaza City on March 12. He has now been held for far longer
than any other Western hostage in the territory.


He was the only Western journalist left working full time in the
increasingly dangerous Gaza Strip when he was taken.


Johnston remains in good health, Palestinian deputy prime
minister Azzam al- Ahmed said on Tuesday, in a meeting with
Britain's consul general to Jerusalem.
