A Pakistan fighter jet crashed Wednesday in the centre of the
country but the pilot ejected safely and there were no casualties
on the ground, an air force spokesman said.


The French-built Mirage aircraft was on a training mission when
it developed technical problems and crashed near Jhang district,
300 kilometres (190 miles) south of Islamabad, spokesman Sarfraz
Ahmed said.


"The pilot ejected safely and there was no damage to life or
property on ground. An inquiry has been ordered into the crash,"
he said.


Pakistan has an ageing fleet of Mirage fighters.


It has signed a deal with the United States to acquire about two
dozen F-16 aircraft and is co-producing JF-17 fighters in
collaboration with China.
