Greek police on Wednesday sealed off the area around the US
embassy in Athens and detained 11 people following a tipoff on a
possible attack on the building, the public order ministry said.


A ministry source said all 11 were Iraqis.


Police said they had acted on information from an Iraqi national
on an imminent attack but now believed that warning was
groundless.


Five houses have been searched so far, and the investigation
continues.


In a statement, the US embassy said the building "is closed today
in precaution because of security information related
specifically to the embassy facilities."


"The embassy is deeply grateful for the exemplary cooperation
provided by Greek authorities," it added.


In January, a Greek far-left group fired an anti-tank rocket
against the embassy in a pre-dawn attack, but nobody was injured.


Greece and the United States have offered a combined two-million
dollar reward for information on the group, Revolutionary
Struggle, which is the country's most dangerous extremist outfit
in operation.


Revolutionary Struggle, which first emerged in 2003, has been
responsible for seven incidents in Athens which have left three
people slightly injured.
