Australian swimming star Grant Hackett has been hospitalised in
Beijing with a serious blood infection caused by flesh-eating
bacteria, reports said Wednesday.


The Olympic champion, who is in the 2008 host city on a
promotional tour, complained of headaches and dizziness shortly
after arriving in China this week.


His right ankle subsequently became severely swollen and he was
taken to hospital for treatment.


"It just started off as the smallest cut and then you sort of
look at it and ... (now it) doesn't look too good," Hackett told
Australian television.


The Herald Sun newspaper quoted him as saying the potentially
dangerous infection was under control and that he would resume
training next week.


"It could have got quite serious if I had let it go any longer.
It got into my bloodstream but I acted promptly, which is a
relief," said the 26-year-old.


Hackett cut himself on a coral reef last week in Fiji, where he
was on his honeymoon after marrying singer Candice Alley.


The once-unbeatable Hackett was hopelessly out of sorts at last
month's world championships in Melbourne, beaten in his pet
1,500m freestyle for the first time in more than a decade as he
struggled for form and fitness.
