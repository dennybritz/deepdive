A 14-year campaign to clean up Malaysia's rivers has been branded
a failure by the country's environment minister after nearly one
in ten have become so polluted they are unsafe for humans to
touch, reports said Wednesday.


Natural Resources and Environment Minister Azmi Khalid said
despite the "Love Our Rivers" campaign, increasing pollution had
rendered 17 of Malaysia's 186 river systems so toxic the water
was unsafe for humans to touch.


"This campaign has been a failure. From what I see, what people
love are the riverbanks as they are well done up with flowers
planted and the like, but not the rivers themselves," Azmi was
quoted as saying by the state Bernama news agency.


"They didn't realise that the campaign was also aimed at keeping
rivers free from pollution and rubbish," he added, according to
the New Straits Times.


Azmi said the 17 rivers were unable to sustain any form of life,
and that improperly treated sewage effluent was a major source of
river pollution.


"Studies have shown that 91 percent of sewage treatment plants in
the country are run inefficiently," said Azmi.


"It will take two billion ringgit (585 million dollars) to
rehabilitate each of these polluted rivers," he added.


The minister said the government would spend seven million
ringgit to re-launch the campaign in June with a new focus on
preserving river environments, according to reports.
